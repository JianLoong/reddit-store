If i dared to voice a complaint, I had hurt his feelings and he would stop talking for a while so he could recover from the pain I had inflicted on him. it was his own father who opened my eyes. He said \u201c i can hardly stand to see him manipulate you like this\u201d and I was genuinely surprised because I really thought he was just a sensitive but somewhat obtuse person.

My children say he\u2019s the father they never had. i know this might not be applicable to your situation. but observe him and let him show you who he really is. in my experience, talks don\u2019t help change behavior, and threats of divorce only bring temporary, insincere change.  the person must actually want to change for themselves and that rarely happens when a pattern is already set. I do think first husband has changed for his second wife. she and i have an amicable relationship. she called me regularly when they were first married and would say \u201cdid he pull this crap with you?  because i am not having it\u201d.
