Also, he may be worried that he may have to pay additional child support if you live full time with your mom. \n\nEither way, threatening you about withholding affection & access - both parental and sibling, is an absolute AH move on your dad's part.

Usually babies spend at least the first few months, if not longer, in their parents rooms. Is this not the case?  And your dad is acting like a baby by not speaking to you.

This might also be why your dad is upset about you stopping visits now as you are leaving so long before having to share your room", "sharing a bedroom with a newborn? you will never sleep.... it's hard. i'm a mother and I would go insane some nights...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.

And that is exactly what this arrangement would do. They should be keeping that child in their bedroom for at least the first six to eight months after birth anyway. That being said, I totally understand why they would want to decorate and prepare the room for the baby's use.  But that still doesn't mean that you should have to lose sleep every night you are there to take care of an infant that is not your child, or because the child's parents are coming in to take care of it at 2:00 a.m. You've made the best move possible by simply removing yourself from the situation.", "Nope NTA. Perfectly old enough to make those decisions and it sounds like him and step mom probably thought you be a bit of a built in nanny for her and the baby.

Do not let them guilt and manipulate you.

You literally can't do that sharing a bedroom with an infant.", "NTA, and you're not immature either.  You are entitled to have privacy at your father's house.

You don't live with him full time, so it's too much to assume that you should get your own room that will be unoccupied 90% of the time. I can understand why your dad would be upset because your reaction (while understandable) comes off as entitled, although his response is clearly an emotional one and an overreaction. Apologize, hope he apologizes in return, and I could almost guarantee you that the baby is going to be sleeping in the parents' room when you're staying over there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This has led the older kid to refuse overnight visits and the ex keeps threatening court. Large age gaps just don't work for shared rooms because kids are at very different developmental stages and have different needs (especially around sleep).", "Your NTA. I can see them using the room when you're not there but they need to have the baby with them, until you graduate high school. No teenager wants to share a room with a baby.

Even then, his reaction still seems unwarranted)", "he should have tought about getting a 3 bedroom place before the kid is born. not after. maybe it was never his intention to upgrade house because you are almost 18", "Don't apologize. Your father started this by behaving like a child. He can end it by being what he should be in this situation: an adult.", "I know, and I agree. My point was that it seems like the parents had other plans and were hoping that OP would play nanny every other weekend"]}
