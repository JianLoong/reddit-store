I would not go back there at all if I were you. And you're right, most judges would absolutely not force you to go live in a room with a newborn baby. I doubt your dad would ever bother to go to the effort of actually trying to force you to do something through a judge.

So you'll have to deal with your parents coming and changing shit and piss filled diapers at any and all hours of the day or night, possibly disposing of used diapers in a trash can in the room (idk how that usually goes, I don't have kids) so you'll have no privacy and a diaper bin to deal with for starters. Speaking of the night, the baby will cry and have issues throughout the night, which will keep you awake. And your parents will have to come in, while you're trying to sleep, and grab the baby to comfort it. So there's even less sleep and less privacy right there. Unless they're going to expect that YOU wake up and take care of the baby in the middle of the night since you'll be there already? Also not acceptable because you aren't the parent and it's not your responsibility. \n\nI do think you could at least visit him but that doesn't have to be overnight.

If course sleeping in the same room as a newborn is going to impact a person's sleep. But unlike what reddit thinks, not every parent is going to dump their children on their older siblings. It is completely possible that OP's dad is upset because his daughter will no longer being staying at his home with him without any ulterior motive. OP's dad might actually be concerned about his relationship with OP.  I know plenty of parents that don't take advantage of their older children. \n\nI think with no evidence one way or the other that the parents deserve the benefit of the doubt. Innocent until proven guilty and all that.", "It's so funny to me how reddit keeps up the wicked step parent thing like it's still the dark ages. My (ex step)dad isn't even married to my mom anymore and they blended the family so well that I talk to him more than her. The happy blended families just don't get noticed because they look like - gasp - ordinary happy families.", "Are we sure about that? Does everyone do this?", "Has that been confirmed? Some people still have their babies sleep in a separate room.", "Depends on the parents.  Many do a nursery right away because they wake at every movement or everytime the baby feeds (usually w bottles) both parents are awake.", "I disagree.  Yes, many parents do that.  But from the evidence we do have OPs Dad doesn't sound like a caring parent who wants that close relationship with his kids.  I think it's 100% possible that baby sleeps in OPs room more or less immediately (especially on weekends that OP is there) and is just OPs problem on those nights because Dad and baby's Mom are tired and need their sleep.  Plus they handle nights the other 12 days so it's perfectly reasonable (in their skewed thinking) for OP to pull some weight.", "So, I looked it up. The AAP made that recommendation just last year. \n\n1. The AAP is full of it. They say that \"science\" supports doing this, and then 1, 2, 5, years later change their minds when the \"science\" supports doing that. \n2. Just because the AAP recommends it doesn't mean it's actually a good idea.\n3. Just because the AAP recommends it doesn't mean parents will do it.", "Plus the difficulty of children or teens feeling replaced by younger children. Navigating the emotions around being a 'visitor' at a parent's home would be hard", "Threatening court?? I'd love to see how that would go -- \"Yes, your honor, my child doesn't want to stay with me just because I gave their bed away and make them sleep in an armchair. Please tell them they have to sleep in the armchair if I say so!!\"", "My sister shared a room with me when I was born. It very quickly went from \"Yay I have a sister!\" to \"Can't you get that baby to stop crying??\"", "My sister and I are 6 years apart. When my parents bought the house before we were born, they planned on having their kids share a room, but because we ended up so far apart in age and the bedrooms are so small, we got our own rooms. It was honestly for the best because we didn\u2019t get along when we were younger.", "That was my immediate thought as well.", "That is brutal. FAS is so gnarly. I\u2019m a foster parent and would rather take a kid who was born addicted to drugs than FAS. They have issues with impulse control that is so incredibly difficult to get under control. Imagine living with a perpetual toddler, who absolutely means well but has zero ability to not get into dangerous situations.", "OP is at her dad's only every other weekend. The change in child support would be negligible.", "There is literally one reason to put the baby in a room that isn\u2019t theirs.", "Evidence?", "I don't think they planned on being the ones doing the night care.", "Could even be in there for a few years until after OP turned 18yo.", "Don't the newborns wake up every couple of hours (assuming that they sleep that long)? They need to eat!", "It won\u2019t make much of a difference because babies are loud. You\u2019re still going to hear the crying in a two bedroom place", "He said that if she doesn't want to stay there then she can't meet her new brother. If he was worried about their relationship he wouldn't place ultimatums like that. Also, if it was me and my new kid I would have the newborn in MY bedroom, at least the first few months while night feedings and establishing sleep schedule is going on. If he can't be bothered to think of something that simple, and is THAT upset I don't think anyone thinking he will try to make her a babysitter is a stretch. \n\nMy teenage nephew stayed with us for a while right after my baby was born, also in a two bedroom. I would NEVER think to have them share a room. My nephew had to go to school, and his weekends were for rest, not staying up with a baby. It's common sense", "It\u2019s pretty normal for the first few months at least, but not everyone does it.  My parents didn\u2019t, but my brother and SIL did.", "No, very few people that I know keep their infants in their rooms with them. I know I didn't.", "The ex even tried to sell the older kid on how \"cool\" the armchair was because it transforms into a bed (turns out it was about as uncomfortable as you would assume from the description). The ex then tried to put an ikea style kallax between the chair and the bed as a room divider but that doesn't actually stop sound or prevent the younger kid from going around it to bug the older kid at night.\n\n> I'd love to see how that would go\n\nThe family member made it clear that they've kept receipts on all the ex's parenting blunders (from minor to egregious) since the custody decision. Through the grapevine, they heard that the ex saw a lawyer but no court order has arrived about the family member not following visitation. The assumption is that the ex's lawyer told them to not make a stink because they would come out of this looking worse and with less visitation. Right now the compromise is that longer overnights (ie. a week in the summer) are occurring when the ex visits their parents who have spare rooms. But otherwise, older kid won't spend the night.", "Dad hoping to pawn his new baby off on his last kid.. probably even already has discussions about it with the stepmom too.      \n       \nOP abruptly moving out has exposed the dirty truth of the thing.", "Mine too. We\u2019ve been on Reddit too long.", "Same", "Essentially 1/3 of kids born in my city. It\u2019s either that or the follow up is lead poisoning", "Evidence?   Neither of my kids slept in my room past 6 weeks and they were perfectly fine. It's called a baby monitor and being an attentive parent.", "But if the baby is in the other bedroom you can pretend you don't and make your teenage daughter take care of the baby at night.", "Oh, interesting. It does seem much more convenient to have the kid right there for night time feedings etc", "ITA. I think for a lot of people, especially for first-time parents, it\u2019s a combo of convenience and nerves, and as the baby sleeps longer and the whole process becomes a bit more routine they move toward baby in the nursery with a monitor.", "Lower chance of SIDS, so doctors recommend it and so it\u2019s pretty normal at least in my country (USA). From what I read on the Internet it\u2019s even more common in most other countries. \n\nMost baby nurseries are basically to hold the baby\u2019s stuff or even literally just go unused entirely for the first months or even longer, in fact reading the title I initially thought a misunderstanding around that was what the conflict of this post was gonna be", "Oh I didn\u2019t realize SIDS would be a concern here. I just thought they couldn\u2019t have anything in the crib with them. Makes sense though", "If makes sense you wouldn\u2019t know because the mechanism isn\u2019t understood at all, but apparently if their crib is in the same room as the parents (but the baby is not in the same bed) the risk of SIDS is somehow slightly lower. It might have to do with them hearing their parents nearby but nobody really knows. The recommendation is for the whole first year in some places \n\nSo that\u2019s why I thought the baby was probably going to be with the parents and OP as a teen didn\u2019t understand roomsharing wasn\u2019t going to be a problem for a long time. Apparently that\u2019s not the situation lol, That\u2019s that\u2019s how common the recommendation is though, most people do it", "Ohhh that\u2019s very interesting. Thanks for explaining!"]}
