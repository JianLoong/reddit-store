She used to be very slim and skinny like me but the meds have completely changed her body composition. \n\nShe brought a few bathing suits and was asking for my opinion on them. She had a one piece and a bikini she was deciding between. She kept saying she looked too fat in the bikini and might wear the one piece, I actually thought the one piece looked better but I didn't say anything because it was up to her. \n\nShe modeled both for me and asked for my opinion. All I said was \"I like the one piece better!\".\n\nShe asked me if I thought she looked fat in the bikini, and I said no I just like the other one better. She started to act super triggered and kept accusing me of thinking she's fat and I told her to f off and wear whatever she wants.\n\nShe put on the one piece and kept making snarky comments about how I think she's fat and I would ignore her but she kept taunting me with comments so I just snapped and said \"yeah you shouldn't wear a bikini cause it doesn't look good on you, happy now? is that what you wanted me to say so badly?\" \n\nShe just started packing her bags and went somewhere, I haven't heard from her since. I heard from our mutual friend Allie that she's safe she just went to a hotel and rebooked her flight.

It doesn\u2019t really seem like it.", "NAH\n\nSure, you could have handled it better, but everyone has their breaking point. \n\nThe only thing I noticed was that she was already saying she looked too fat for the bikini. I think she was hoping for support from you to tell her that she wasn't too fat. You basically said that she was, in fact, too fat by telling her she should wear the one-piece. It sounds like you were trying to be honest and polite, but to her it was just insulting and rude. That, in her mind, gave her the right to taunt you, and you understandably got fed up and snapped back. \n\nIn the end, my guess is that she's having a really hard time with the changes, which probably isn't helping with her depression. She's likely oversensitive to the weight issue and was looking for her best friend to just tell her she looks great in a bikini. And it's not your fault that you didn't get that. It's just really unfortunate.", "I don't know if YTA or not, I feel like part of this conversation is missing.\n\nThat said, you clearly DO think she's fat and were likely projecting that opinion regardless of what words you used.", "ESH - From your first paragraph and what you said you clearly think she's too fat to wear a bikini.

Also I just feel like a good friend would try to help her friend feel a little better about the weight gain and tried to give her some good worded confidence.\n\nThat being said she shouldn't have been so pushy about what you truly thought. Also, she might just have been looking for a friend to tell her girl you look awesome in the bikini, rock it girl you look good in anything etc. And while that doesn't necessarily mean that she's an asshole, she needs to learn how to find this confidence within herself instead of searching for someone else's approval.", ">I just snapped and said \"yeah you shouldn't wear a bikini cause it doesn't look good on you, happy now? is that what you wanted me to say so badly?\"\n\nThis was a lose-lose situation, but ESH.

But she's on depression meds and clearly is having body issues, which does not help with her depression.

She's not stupid, she knows what you think of her. So she had a test. She was going to needle you until you blew up and told her what she wanted to hear: that you think she's fat.\n\nEveryone sucks. Sounds like she has serious issues with her body and is going around looking for people to validate her self-hatred. You definitely willingly played that role for her, it wasn't at all a chore for you to admit that you judge her for being fat and wearing a bikini.\n\nYou were not a good friend to someone going through a rough time with depression and their feelings about their body. She is behaving irrationally, but totally understandably for someone that has depression and is a young woman in a society that has zero tolerance for weight gain.\n\nYou both were really mean to each other. I can't judge you too harshly since we all get to live in the same soup of bullshit that convinces us to judge women harshly for weight gain, but you did say the wrong thing at the wrong time, right in the middle of whatever depression spiral she was in.\n\nLots of other commenters will tell you that you shouldn't have any concerns about your friend's emotions, but that's a lonely and morally bankrupt way to live. Sure you can spend your life being concerned who legally has the right to say this and that or you can be more emotionally intuitive and care about your friends' feelings.

I understand she provoked you to say out loud that you didn't like the bikini on her but ideally you should've taken a step back and told her you wouldn't talk with her until she calmed down. Her insecurities probably got the best of her(not an excuse still) and she might no be thinking rational in that moment. Hopefully she'll calm down after some time. But I understand that actually handling the situation as it happens is a lot more difficult than a stranger telling you what you should've done.\n\nEdit: I saw some comments criticizing the second paragraph but it doesn't seem like fat shaming or anything like that. It's relevant information for this story and recoginzing that someone has gained weight isn't a problem unless you make it one.

Sure, you could have said \"what's going on? is there some reason you don't want me to like the one-piece?\" But frankly, she set you up for this and underneath her righteous indignation, she knows it. She went into it self-conscious about her body and waiting for someone to confirm her fears to allay them completely. The second is almost impossible when someone feels self-conscious and though you tried to remain neutral, your post indicates that you do indeed think she is fat and that her weight makes her look less attractive in the bikini, so that was an unlikely outcome.

This is going to be the start of a very long learning lesson for OP, as friends have babies and \"get fat\", perhaps get sick/locked down/depressed (see Covid) where literally all of my friends gained 15-25 lbs, aging in general...\n\nand (b)...\n\nThere are a dozen reasons a swimsuit (or anything) looks good on someone, and it doesn't boil down to one-piece = fat girls, 2 piece = skinny girls.\n\nFit, color, fabric, print, style, etc etc...\n\nOP wasn't being helpful, honest, or any of the above. The honest response is \"You are fine. Who is out there anyways? My 12-year old brother and me?! No reason to be self-conscious at all.\"  That's the only \"snapping\" that should've happened, is she's wasting energy worried about nothing. \"If you think you look fat in this bikini and you don't, then don't wear it and let's get swimming\".", "Yeah, it sounds like absolute outrage tourism.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, which is why she shouldn't have just said \"the one piece\" in a lose-lose situation...\n\nFriend : Maybe I should wear the one-piece because I'm so fat.\n\nOP: Yes, I agree. I also like the one-piece on you.\n\nFriend: B/c you agree I'm fat?\n\nAgain, as I've said... it was gearing up for lose-lose, so OP should have just said they are both cute and she has no preference or given an actual reason for the one-piece (it's a better color), then just stopped engaging. I would've been like \"I don't think you're fat, you think you're fat and I'm not playing that game\"... but OP also does think her friend is fat (when it's unlikely she is fat, and just thicker than in the past).", "How is OP TA when their friend essentially kept pressuring them to call them fat and they wouldn't let it go?

When you harass your friend for their *real* opinion of how you look you shouldn't be surprised when A) they're mad at you for harassing them and B) their real opinion isn't one you want to hear. So she bullied her friend into calling her fat and then got mad and went home early? Seems like 200% her fault.", "That makes more sense! \n\nI still say ESH, but everyone makes mistakes with their friends. She's probably going through a hard time with the meds and gaining weight, which is absolutely no reason to take it out on you, but it makes a bit of sense why she's reacting how she is. \n\nMy youngest sister often gets angry at me and puts words in my mouth or tries to say things I'm not saying. So, I've learned to clarify so she doesn't misunderstand, say the stuff that make it seem less \"judgemental\" when asked about things, even if that's not how I meant it, and not say anything at all when not asked. Some people are more touchy, and it's a pain, but if you care about them and want to be around them, you find work-arounds. \n\nYou don't have to stay around your friend if it becomes too much of a hassle, but this will probably be a problem for a while. She definitely shouldn't have kept pushing you, but what you said was mean and you knew that.

If she can't even bring herself to say in her initial submission that she does not judge her friend, then she probably does, even perhaps subconsciously. Not that it's entirely fair to judge her for that, everyone is raised in the same culture that judges women for gaining weight super harshly.\n\nESH because snapping and validating the fears of someone in a depressive cycle is a shitty thing to do. She hurt her friend.

You knew *why* she wanted you to agree (because she feels bad about herself and her weight gain and thinks she can't wear the bikini because she's fat), and then you did without further explanation. If you truly just thought one looked better than the other and it had nothing to do with her weight, then why not say that?

She made a positive decision to handle mental health issues and unfortunately, the results are causing other challenges for her.\n\nYour best friend planned a trip and spent money to visit you and probably expected to be hyped up from you when trying on clothes. I know I would because that's how my friends are. We know each other's strengths and challenges and their opinions matter more to me than random strangers. \n\n\"Girl, the color of that one piece looks amazing on you! Now, I need some new sunglasses if I'm going to keep looking at you!\"\n\n\"Yes, bestie, rock that one piece because it looks good!

Let's get them high and pretty to say hello!\"\n\nI'm sure this wasn't your first time seeing your best friend's insecurity around her weight gain. Your friend definitely has to work on her self-esteem but is now adjusting to a world where her mental illness is less of a stigma than her physical appearance. It's difficult realizing how openly hateful people are towards those who are overweight and being on the receiving end due to trying to take care of mental health issues is it's own kind of hell.\n\nPeople assume she's lazy and unhealthy and treat her with contempt - like many of the comments in here. I don't think you're an AH but I think if she's your best friend, you can handle her a bit differently than an acquaintance. It's not your job to manage her self-esteem but as a best friend, is it too hard to hype her up more especially when she probably receives more criticism and hate than ever now?", "I was taught there's only one way to truly get a bikini body: get a bikini and put it on your body. \ud83d\ude0a", "> She started to act super triggered\n\nI would\u2019ve said NTA but this sentence alone makes it ESH", "ESH, body positivity is a good thing and not a privilege deserved by only the thin. Seriously, learn more about it and, even if you\u2019re thin for your entire life, you will benefit from the knowledge of what it\u2019s about in the long run. \n\nThere are other options you had in responses that would have been honest, and while I applaud your attempt to spare your friend\u2019s feelings the reason she reacted the way that she did might have been because she knew you well enough to know that you weren\u2019t being honest with her. I believe that people are entitled to receive honesty, ESPECIALLY when they ask for it. They are not entitled to receive an answer simply because it makes them feel good. That being said, when people ask me questions like that, I like to tell/remind them that I will but only if they are OK with the following all being acceptable answers to any question:\n1) Yes\n2) No\n3) I don\u2019t know\n4) I\u2019m not ready to talk about that\n5) I\u2019m not ready to talk about that with you\nIf someone isn\u2019t OK with me using any of the above answers then I\u2019m not OK with their expectations of me answering their question.\n\nOnce you find a way to deal with people in an honest way, look for the space within your own heart for yourself and others to be imperfect. \u2018Cause guess, we are ALL imperfect. The clothes a person should wear are the ones that fit their body and that they like. Now, there\u2019s a difference between what she likes and what she\u2019s comfortable wearing, but that\u2019s coming up. Back to you now. Be honest but hold space for what can be true as opposed to simply what you\u2019ve been conditioned to believe. There\u2019s a difference between, \u201cOh no, girl, I love that bikini but it\u2019s not fitting you right. Look at how it\u2019s pinching in the back,\u201d and hold up a mirror behind her to see it making back cleavage or something, and \u201cI don\u2019t like that bikini on you because you\u2019re above a size X.\u201d  The first is honest and helpful while the second is honest \u2014 in your opinion \u2014 and not helpful because it\u2019s not based in fact, like the first one talking about fit, it\u2019s based in your opinion about judgmental attitudes about women\u2019s bodies or bodies in general. Some things will never fit some people properly, but that\u2019s different from fitting properly and having others judge their body. Let go of that stuff, cause even if you\u2019re a skinny-Minnie it is holding you back. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re saying your friend wasn\u2019t happy with your answer. If that\u2019s the case and she\u2019s simply not happy with her body then that\u2019s an issue she needs to address. Our bodies are simply vehicles to move through life. Period. Saying that one person\u2019s a body is better than another\u2019s is like saying that a BMW Z4 Roadster body is inherently better than a BMW X7 body. If she wanted you to convince her that she should love her body, well that\u2019s not your job, and honestly it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re there yet. Maybe she was looking for honesty and would have been OK with a lie she believed but she didn\u2019t believe what you admit was a lie to save her feeling and she was hurt that you didn\u2019t lie more believably to her.
