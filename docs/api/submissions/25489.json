She used to be very slim and skinny like me but the meds have completely changed her body composition. \n\nShe brought a few bathing suits and was asking for my opinion on them. She had a one piece and a bikini she was deciding between. She kept saying she looked too fat in the bikini and might wear the one piece, I actually thought the one piece looked better but I didn't say anything because it was up to her. \n\nShe modeled both for me and asked for my opinion. All I said was \"I like the one piece better!\".\n\nShe asked me if I thought she looked fat in the bikini, and I said no I just like the other one better. She started to act super triggered and kept accusing me of thinking she's fat and I told her to f off and wear whatever she wants.\n\nShe put on the one piece and kept making snarky comments about how I think she's fat and I would ignore her but she kept taunting me with comments so I just snapped and said \"yeah you shouldn't wear a bikini cause it doesn't look good on you, happy now? is that what you wanted me to say so badly?\" \n\nShe just started packing her bags and went somewhere, I haven't heard from her since. I heard from our mutual friend Allie that she's safe she just went to a hotel and rebooked her flight.

It doesn\u2019t really seem like it.", "NAH\n\nSure, you could have handled it better, but everyone has their breaking point. \n\nThe only thing I noticed was that she was already saying she looked too fat for the bikini. I think she was hoping for support from you to tell her that she wasn't too fat. You basically said that she was, in fact, too fat by telling her she should wear the one-piece. It sounds like you were trying to be honest and polite, but to her it was just insulting and rude. That, in her mind, gave her the right to taunt you, and you understandably got fed up and snapped back. \n\nIn the end, my guess is that she's having a really hard time with the changes, which probably isn't helping with her depression. She's likely oversensitive to the weight issue and was looking for her best friend to just tell her she looks great in a bikini. And it's not your fault that you didn't get that. It's just really unfortunate.", "I don't know if YTA or not, I feel like part of this conversation is missing.\n\nThat said, you clearly DO think she's fat and were likely projecting that opinion regardless of what words you used.", "ESH - From your first paragraph and what you said you clearly think she's too fat to wear a bikini.

Also I just feel like a good friend would try to help her friend feel a little better about the weight gain and tried to give her some good worded confidence.\n\nThat being said she shouldn't have been so pushy about what you truly thought. Also, she might just have been looking for a friend to tell her girl you look awesome in the bikini, rock it girl you look good in anything etc. And while that doesn't necessarily mean that she's an asshole, she needs to learn how to find this confidence within herself instead of searching for someone else's approval.", ">I just snapped and said \"yeah you shouldn't wear a bikini cause it doesn't look good on you, happy now? is that what you wanted me to say so badly?\"\n\nThis was a lose-lose situation, but ESH.

But she's on depression meds and clearly is having body issues, which does not help with her depression.

She's not stupid, she knows what you think of her. So she had a test. She was going to needle you until you blew up and told her what she wanted to hear: that you think she's fat.\n\nEveryone sucks. Sounds like she has serious issues with her body and is going around looking for people to validate her self-hatred. You definitely willingly played that role for her, it wasn't at all a chore for you to admit that you judge her for being fat and wearing a bikini.\n\nYou were not a good friend to someone going through a rough time with depression and their feelings about their body. She is behaving irrationally, but totally understandably for someone that has depression and is a young woman in a society that has zero tolerance for weight gain.\n\nYou both were really mean to each other. I can't judge you too harshly since we all get to live in the same soup of bullshit that convinces us to judge women harshly for weight gain, but you did say the wrong thing at the wrong time, right in the middle of whatever depression spiral she was in.\n\nLots of other commenters will tell you that you shouldn't have any concerns about your friend's emotions, but that's a lonely and morally bankrupt way to live. Sure you can spend your life being concerned who legally has the right to say this and that or you can be more emotionally intuitive and care about your friends' feelings.

I understand she provoked you to say out loud that you didn't like the bikini on her but ideally you should've taken a step back and told her you wouldn't talk with her until she calmed down. Her insecurities probably got the best of her(not an excuse still) and she might no be thinking rational in that moment. Hopefully she'll calm down after some time. But I understand that actually handling the situation as it happens is a lot more difficult than a stranger telling you what you should've done.\n\nEdit: I saw some comments criticizing the second paragraph but it doesn't seem like fat shaming or anything like that. It's relevant information for this story and recoginzing that someone has gained weight isn't a problem unless you make it one.

Sure, you could have said \"what's going on? is there some reason you don't want me to like the one-piece?\" But frankly, she set you up for this and underneath her righteous indignation, she knows it. She went into it self-conscious about her body and waiting for someone to confirm her fears to allay them completely. The second is almost impossible when someone feels self-conscious and though you tried to remain neutral, your post indicates that you do indeed think she is fat and that her weight makes her look less attractive in the bikini, so that was an unlikely outcome. Meanwhile, she jumped at the slightest hint that her fears were being confirmed to push further. Her feelings about this are probably exacerbated by the fact that you are still \"slim and skinny\" and she used to be, but is no longer; if you had also gained significant weight, she probably would have felt more comfortable or if you weren't at a public pool (which is what I'm assuming since you say you went to the pool, not that you have a pool).

I would've been like \"I don't think you're fat, you think you're fat and I'm not playing that game\"... but OP also does think her friend is fat (when it's unlikely she is fat, and just thicker than in the past).", "How is OP TA when their friend essentially kept pressuring them to call them fat and they wouldn't let it go?

So, I've learned to clarify so she doesn't misunderstand, say the stuff that make it seem less \"judgemental\" when asked about things, even if that's not how I meant it, and not say anything at all when not asked. Some people are more touchy, and it's a pain, but if you care about them and want to be around them, you find work-arounds. \n\nYou don't have to stay around your friend if it becomes too much of a hassle, but this will probably be a problem for a while.
