I have chosen not to date or seek another romantic partner and that is something I have been vocal about with family and friends. I do not want to date and please do not attempt to set me up.\n\nAlmost a year ago my sister's best friend lost her husband. Within 7 months she was reaching out to me to talk and almost right away told me she wanted us to be together. She said we would understand each other and her kids needed a dad and she would be a good mom to my now adult children. I told her that I was not interested in a romantic relationship and if she wanted that, she needed to find someone else.\n\nShe has not backed off. She has attempted to introduce me to her children and she has asked to meet my children. One day she showed up at my house when my youngest was home and she was trying to convince him we had something going on between us. She made both my son and I very uncomfortable. \n\nTwo months ago I purchased a smaller house for myself which I call my grandpa house because I am about to be a grandpa and can have my grandchildren over but it's less daunting when I'm alone. She wanted to know why I was making big life changes and downsizing when her kids are still young.\n\nMy sister is aware of what is going on. I have told her. I have asked her to help me get her friend to stop. She thinks the idea is a good one and encouraged me to give her friend a chance because \"two widows together makes sense\". So she has been no help. She was supposed to host a big family Christmas this year and she's also someone who throws regular dinner parties. Her friend is always there now and so I told my sister I would no longer be attending these gatherings while her friend is invited. My sister told me I was being unfair expecting her to not include her friend. I told her she is welcome to include her but she makes me uncomfortable so I am deciding not to include myself. She also believes I am being cruel to her friend who knows I always attend and now she sees me not and that Christmas will be the biggest insult.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670058671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbc6qc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_will_no_longer_be/", "score": 568, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That woman is delusional and your sister is feeding her delusions, which can be very dangerous.", "NTA. Talk to a lawyer about sending a cease and desist letter. Tell the family that you're skipping the holidays with them since a certain someone won't stop trying to set you up with a stalker.", "NTA\n\nWhy is you sister OK with harrassement?", "I'm sorry for your loss OP. My mom did the same thing. She found the love of her life and he unfortunately passed young. My mom's sister still has a hard time understanding. It's been 34 years.", "I am so sorry for your loss.\ud83d\udc97 When my dad passed away, my mom stated she would never date or marry again. Personally, I feel the same if my husband passed.

You sister and her friend are the AHs!!\n\nIf this situation was reversed and it was you who was pursuing this friend relentlessly and not taking no for an answer, everyone would be telling you that you were a creep, stalker, and harasser.\n\nThis is not ok.

She is stalking and harassing you, and your sister is helping facilitate it.", "I think the widow's behavior is stalking. Not borderline stalking. Over the line stalking. Sure, there are more egregious examples of stalking, but she is stalking you. She has been studying you to find out where you live, who your closest relatives are, and when you and they are in your home. She has been using your relatives to glean information about you to assist her in stalking you, but that doesn't mean it isn't stalking.  \n\nYou are NTA.\n\nYour sister is an asshole. The widow is an asshole, a royal asshole.", "Yikes and NTA.  You are being harassed.  You made it clear to both your sister and her friend that you had no romantic interest in her. I bet by now, you also have 0 interest in a friendship.

I'm sorry she is doing this. \n\nI am also so sorry for you loss. If I were to lose my child's father, I'd never be with someone else. I get it. Congratulations on your soon to be grandchild!", "NTA, and this woman's behaviour is really creepy. Asking you why you downsized when her kids are still young? It appears that in her head, you're already 'together'. It doesn't matter what your sister thinks, you do not want to be with this woman and **this is your decision to make**. You need to talk to a lawyer or even the police for guidance, because your sister is only working against you and I doubt you just telling her again will make her stop. \n\nI'd be going NC with your sister for the time being.

Your sister's reaction is very disappointing.", "NTA. This woman is stalking you. Your sister is condoning it.", "NTA and get a restraining order against the friend. She sound totally unhinged!", "!UpdateMe", "NTA. You are being harassed and that is not okay. As someone else said if the roles were reversed, you would be seen as a creep. Well guess what she\u2019s a creep. \n\nAnd if your sister cannot understand your choice then she should at least respect them. If you guys have a good relationship, I\u2019ll be honest it\u2019s a little wild to me that she would choose her best friend who\u2019s not acting appropriately over you. They\u2019ll very least your sister could do would be to speak with the friend and let her know that she needs to back off and then her  behavior is completely, and totally inappropriate.", "If the gender roles were reversed i bet your sister would do more to help you. Its harassment and you shouldnt have to put up with it. It sounds like the grief has overwhelmed her and shes pinned her feelings on to you. I would take steps to insure you and your kids safety like cameras etc.\nNTA", "NTA. You expressed a very clear boundary, and this woman is not only disrespecting that, but is engaging in extremely concerning behaviour. Between showing up and trying to convince your youngest child that the two of you are an item, and taking personal offense at your decision to downsize your home, it sounds like she has already fabricated a relationship with you in her mind. Your sister is, at best, ignoring your expressly stated decision on this matter, and at worst potentially exposing you to danger by feeding this woman's delusions. You are under no obligation to spend time with this woman, never mind enter into a relationship with her. And while your sister is under no obligation to stop inviting her around, she knows that decision will mean you no longer come around, and she has no right to be upset at that consequence, since this woman has shown she has no intention of respecting your boundaries.\n\nStart documenting each time she attempts to force herself into your life by dropping by or otherwise violating your boundaries. Get security cameras for your home. Make sure that nobody who supports this woman's delusions has a copy of your house key, and inform anyone who does about her and the chance she may try to get to you through them.

It\u2019s not ok in any way shape or form and she needs to knock it off.

Your *consent* matters. You have said no many many times and it\u2019s despicable that they hadn\u2019t been respected.", "The womand could be lovely but I actually think it is amazing of you to respect your deceased wife's memory like this and your sister has to learn to back off.\n\nSo no, NTA.", "Get a restraining order if ya need.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.  Keep your eye on this situation because she sounds incredibly unhealthy and she needs to get help before she does something stupid.

She's trying to set you two up.\n\nMy advice in this is simple. Tell your sister and her friend that this needs to stop, because next time police will be involved. Especially given that she arrived at your home unannounced to try and convince your youngest of her twisted lies.\n\nGet yourself a door camera so you can keep track of whenever she shows up. And a formal Cease and desist letter tends to do wonders.\n\nIf the genders were reversed here, everyone would be calling your sister's friend a creep and a stalker.\n\nShe's making you and your children uncomfortable and your sister is supporting that.
