I have chosen not to date or seek another romantic partner and that is something I have been vocal about with family and friends. I do not want to date and please do not attempt to set me up.\n\nAlmost a year ago my sister's best friend lost her husband. Within 7 months she was reaching out to me to talk and almost right away told me she wanted us to be together. She said we would understand each other and her kids needed a dad and she would be a good mom to my now adult children. I told her that I was not interested in a romantic relationship and if she wanted that, she needed to find someone else.\n\nShe has not backed off. She has attempted to introduce me to her children and she has asked to meet my children. One day she showed up at my house when my youngest was home and she was trying to convince him we had something going on between us. She made both my son and I very uncomfortable. \n\nTwo months ago I purchased a smaller house for myself which I call my grandpa house because I am about to be a grandpa and can have my grandchildren over but it's less daunting when I'm alone. She wanted to know why I was making big life changes and downsizing when her kids are still young.\n\nMy sister is aware of what is going on. I have told her. I have asked her to help me get her friend to stop. She thinks the idea is a good one and encouraged me to give her friend a chance because \"two widows together makes sense\". So she has been no help. She was supposed to host a big family Christmas this year and she's also someone who throws regular dinner parties. Her friend is always there now and so I told my sister I would no longer be attending these gatherings while her friend is invited. My sister told me I was being unfair expecting her to not include her friend. I told her she is welcome to include her but she makes me uncomfortable so I am deciding not to include myself. She also believes I am being cruel to her friend who knows I always attend and now she sees me not and that Christmas will be the biggest insult.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670058671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbc6qc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_will_no_longer_be/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please do be careful. While it's not as common as male stalkers, there absolutely have been deadly female stalkers.", "Absolutely NTA. In fact, you may want to consider limiting contact with your sister because she\u2019s not only allowing this delusional behavior but it sounds like she\u2019s actually encouraging it. \n\nFriend honestly sounds like a ticking time bomb, make sure you have a good security system or a camera or two at the very least and nobody in the family has any spare keys that sister could make copies of and/or loan to friend.", "\"Your 'friend' is harassing me. I have told her that I am not interested, but she doesn't care about my feelings at all and has chosen to continue to harass me. I don't know why you think I should care that her feelings might be hurt by my absence... Frankly, if she feels insulted that I'm not there, maybe she will finally get the message and stop harassing me. And I am extremely disappointed in *you* that, instead of telling your friend that it is inappropriate to harass people, your instinct was to try to convince me to let her continue harassing me.\"\n\nNTA. I'm sorry your sister isn't supporting you, but as long as she is willing to invite your harasser into her home, you have every right to avoid it.

She has, if you will, overdrawn her account of your compassion on that front. \n\nYou are not obligated to place yourself in a social setting that is layered on top of hugely invasive behaviour. \n\nAlso, your sister is an unreal AH. What is this \u2018widows together make sense\u2019? Some bizarre form of mathematical equation of what apparently makes sense but contains no human feeling? Ultimately, it even shows no regard for her friend \u2014 like she\u2019s rushing to \u2018solve\u2019 her rather than listening.", "NTA. if this was a roles reversed scenario - a widower harassing, stalking and pressuring a widow - people would be up in arms. Instead, your sister is ignoring your feelings and endorsing this harassment. \n\nLc or nc looking like a reeeeeeeeally good option.", "NTA by any means. \n\nYou\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t want another romantic partner. And both your sister and her friend should accept that. \n\nThe fact that the woman *came to your house* is so unbelievably disrespectful to you. Huge red flag, especially considering she is just assuming something you\u2019re together because she thinks you should be. And you know what they say when you assume things. You aren\u2019t even dating and she thinks she has a say over your life decisions?? She sounds a little delusional and probably still hasn\u2019t processed her husband\u2019s death or given herself and her kids time to grieve.

I'll never understand why people push and completely ignore the wishes of their friend or family member because they THINK they know what's best for them. Your sister needs to make her friend understand the real life situation or honestly you have every right to get very rude with this overbearing woman!", "Nta. A straight up fruit cake or still dealing with the loss very badly. Stalker vibe to boot. Gaslighting your kid, jeez..\nSelf exclusion - skillful swordsmanship with the sister that shouldnt have been required.", "NTA, your sister knows what you\u2019ve been through and you were clear about what you wanted and if she can\u2019t respect that then she deserves to be cut out along with her crazy stalker friend.", "Ohhh... N T A. \n\nDoes your sister know that this woman showed up at your house and tried to tell your kids that you two are a thing and that they're getting a new mommy? If she does, and maintains that you saying no is \"cruel\" to her friend, then WOW. \n\nThis woman needs to be aware that there's \"no thank you\", then there's \"no\", and then there's \"restraining order\". Maybe your sister can convey that. I wouldn't go near her again. \n\nAlso, I am sorry for your loss, even if it's been years ago, it's clear how much she meant and how much you honor her. You sound like you will be an absolutely awesome grandpa :)", "Absolutely NTA! I'm glad you're noticing these giant red flags and standing up for yourself and the boundaries you have put in place. Your sister putting this (frankly awful) person above you feels very icky, too. \n\nJust because you're both widows it doesn't mean you're compatible. You don't want to date her. That's that.", "No, you are not the asshole in this situation. You have made it clear to this woman that you are not interested in a romantic relationship and she has not respected your boundaries. It is not unreasonable for you to choose to not attend gatherings where you feel uncomfortable. Your sister should be supporting you and helping to enforce your boundaries, not trying to convince you to be with someone you do not want to be with.", "Mate, both your sister and her friend are delusional Aholes if they don't realize how wrong what they are doing is. NTA, obviously. You might want to look into getting a restraining order, just saying...", "NTA - she is harassing you and your sister is enabling her. Imagine thinking she has some kind of say in what kind of house you buy.

The woman is harassing you, she's either lost her mind from grief, doesn't know how to function alone, has a personality disorder that makes her refuse any other reality but the one she choose, or a mental health issue that needs to be addressed - and your sister encourages this? You made your stance clear, you're not misleading anyone, and you're doing all you can to disengage. You did not make an ultimatum of the her or me type, you gracefully bowed out and explained why. You did nothing wrong. \n\nI am sorry for your loss, and for having to raise your kids without your wife, and you have every right to choose how you'll live your life.", "NTA -RUUUN!!! the woman is crazy, might be grief or something, but keep entertaining her and i swear she gonna kill you, ill be watching your ass in these crime dramas, tell your sister to stop sharing news with her and if she keeps it up you cut her off.", "You're NTA!  \nif the roles were reversed you'll be called something else. Just because she's grieving she doesn't get a leeway for her craps. Don't think I'm trying to scare you but do what you have to do to make her know for sure that you two definitely won't be an item before the baby arrives. Just so that she won't be near you when you're vulnerable & she doesn't weasel her way more into your family. \n\nYour sister is definitely an AH for not considering your feelings & needs a stern talking to. \n\nCongratulations on your grandkid, I'm sure you'll be the best grandpa\u2764", "NTA\n\nI say this with all seriousness please consider getting a restraining order. This woman is grief stricken and absolutely nuts. She's already shown up at your house and she seems to have a very unhealthy obsession with you. Stay vigilant.

I would have already told her what I thought.", "NTA \n\nNo words on either this crazy woman or your sister. Just speechless from the crazy.\nYou owe neither of them an explanation or an apology for your choices.", "NTA, this woman sounds nuts. Cut contact with her and get a restraining order if you need to!", "NTA. Harassment that is encouraged by a sibling is a doozy. Might be best to go low contact with your sister.\n\n\nHow do your children feel about this?", "NTA.   You choose where you go.  If you don't want to go, then don't.   Her friend is just not taking her husband's passing well.  If your sister was a true and good friend to this woman, she would be telling her to go to bereavement counseling.   This poor woman is just freaking out over this and sees you as the ticket back to normalcy and security.  Stay away!", "NTA. Their behaviour is quite twisted. Do they genuinely believe that you aren't capable of making decisions for yourself?", "NTA. If your sister had your back and told her friend to back off then maybe the outcome would have been different.", "NTA - Your sister's friend sounds like she is mentally unwell.   Asking you why you're downsizing when \\*her\\* kids are still young?  After as many times as you've told her you are not interested in a relationship?   Staying well away from her is the best solution because every contact, in person, text, whatever, just feeds her delusion.  Your sister is an A H for not helping.  Sorry.  You can't worry about the subtleties of whether the deluded friend will be offended by you not being at Christmas.  NC.", "NTA. If the roles were reversed, I'm pretty sure this would be a big concern for your sister and that you'd be immediately seen as a stalker.", "Nta. But I might also throw in the caveat, \" Sis I will consider being in the same space as your friend after she has had 3 years of grief counseling.  She doesn't appear to be handling the loss of her spouse well, and I am not trained to be the support she needs.\" Hopefully by then friend gets enough help to see how wrong she is being", "NTA. Your sister's friend isn't the AH either. She's grieving and, from the sound of it, likely being encouraged in her delusional pursuit of you by your sister, who *is* the AH.\n\nYou don't state how old your sister is but she's certainly old enough to know what boundaries are and how to respect them. She's just choosing not to in your case because she wants to play matchmaker.
