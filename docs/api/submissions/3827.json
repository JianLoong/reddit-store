I have chosen not to date or seek another romantic partner and that is something I have been vocal about with family and friends. I do not want to date and please do not attempt to set me up.\n\nAlmost a year ago my sister's best friend lost her husband. Within 7 months she was reaching out to me to talk and almost right away told me she wanted us to be together. She said we would understand each other and her kids needed a dad and she would be a good mom to my now adult children. I told her that I was not interested in a romantic relationship and if she wanted that, she needed to find someone else.\n\nShe has not backed off. She has attempted to introduce me to her children and she has asked to meet my children. One day she showed up at my house when my youngest was home and she was trying to convince him we had something going on between us. She made both my son and I very uncomfortable. \n\nTwo months ago I purchased a smaller house for myself which I call my grandpa house because I am about to be a grandpa and can have my grandchildren over but it's less daunting when I'm alone. She wanted to know why I was making big life changes and downsizing when her kids are still young.\n\nMy sister is aware of what is going on. I have told her. I have asked her to help me get her friend to stop. She thinks the idea is a good one and encouraged me to give her friend a chance because \"two widows together makes sense\". So she has been no help. She was supposed to host a big family Christmas this year and she's also someone who throws regular dinner parties. Her friend is always there now and so I told my sister I would no longer be attending these gatherings while her friend is invited. My sister told me I was being unfair expecting her to not include her friend. I told her she is welcome to include her but she makes me uncomfortable so I am deciding not to include myself. She also believes I am being cruel to her friend who knows I always attend and now she sees me not and that Christmas will be the biggest insult.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670058671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbc6qc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_will_no_longer_be/", "score": 5761, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't appear to be handling the loss of her spouse well, and I am not trained to be the support she needs.\" Hopefully by then friend gets enough help to see how wrong she is being", "NTA. Your sister's friend isn't the AH either. She's grieving and, from the sound of it, likely being encouraged in her delusional pursuit of you by your sister, who *is* the AH.\n\nYou don't state how old your sister is but she's certainly old enough to know what boundaries are and how to respect them.

However, you are not him and never will be. Even if you were to enter a relationship with this woman, it wouldn\u2019t be what she wanted and DEFINITELY nothing you would want. She needs to slow down and allow herself to grieve the loss of the man she loved and actually sit with it. Depending on how young her kids are, she should be using this time to help her kids with the grieving process as well. Adding another father figure within a year of him passing can be a very jarring thing for children at some ages, especially if they don\u2019t have a concept of death. I hope she gets help from someone who can truly get her to a better place.

If this person can't understand a no, then you wouldn't want to be with them anyway. Forcing contact, guilt trips, emotional manipulation, all of these are red flags and your sibling should be ashamed for supporting this.

They already have a father, he just can't be around anymore....

Threats, petty crimes, and more.  Still have the occasional nightmare about it all, and she's dead.  We never reported it, as we were still in that mindset of recovering from her abuses and didn't realize it was \"that bad.\"", "I've had two female stalkers. I'm a woman and bi. One of them was a woman I was seeing very briefly and she kept getting my number somehow even after I'd change it. She didn't make threats but it was extremely unnerving to have her continue to pursue me to that extent. Eventually she stopped so I'm assuming she found someone else to turn her attentions to. \n\nThe other was a friend of a friend who I\u2019d never been close to in any way but I\u2019d see her around in school before I graduated. She added me on FB a few years ago (like 8yrs after graduation) and I saw no harm in it but a while after she added me she started messaging me about problems in her life. I was nice and chatted and gave her advice, tried to cheer her up some, but didn't get close to her still since she seemed to have a very drama filled life. Drama is not something I like to be around so I kept my distance. We never hung out in person, just chatted online on occasion. Then she started reminiscing about us hanging out back in high school and the \u201call fun we had.\u201d\n\nI'll be honest, I have memory problems due to depression and physical health issues that started getting bad back then. So I didn't remember hanging out with her like she was talking about, but I just kind of thought that my memory was worse than I\u2019d initially thought especially since some of what she was saying rang a bell. Then she told a story that I knew for a fact happened with a different friend of mine and it clicked for me. She had heard stories from other friends of mine about them coming over to my house in high school and was self-inserting herself into them. Basically was writing fanfics about us being best friends in her head. \n\nI knew for a fact that the story she\u2019d told about riding the four wheeler with me and hitting my dads boat trailer happened with a different friend because someone I'm still close with from back then also remembered that event. I blocked the girl on FB and she's now made fake profiles on several occasions to [message](https://ibb.co/PhZFcS6) me and loses her shit on me telling me she misses me and is going to find me to make me pay for \u201cbreaking her heart.\u201d \n\nI've had the more female stalkers than male so far, with my ex-bf being the only man to pull that sort of shenanigan. To be fair though, he's also been the worst of them all and has gone so far as to attempt to come to where I was with a chefs knife after he told a friend of his he was going to gut me and is the reason I moved over a thousand miles away. He still tries to message me online on different social media platforms, tries to follow my locked down accounts using fake but obvious accounts, and has tried to add my best friend on LinkedIn at one point. He contacts my family and tries to get them to tell him where I am. He replies to comments I've made in public groups on FB because I wouldn't reply on messenger and have it set to not allow message requests now that I figured out I could do that. We have a video of him at my friend's dad's house looking for me so he's now traveled to the state I moved to trying to find me more than 3 yrs after I ended the relationship and fled the state. \n\nSo female stalkers definitely exist and aren't uncommon, but in my experience they're more creepy than an actually dangerous. Male stalkers take the cake on being a legitimate threat both for me anecdotally and statistically speaking.\n\nETA: Not saying that female stalkers can't be more of a problem than I've dealt with. They absolutely can be and can escalate to be as bad as any male stalker can be. It's just less common for them to escalate like that.", "Unfortunately we still live in the world where unwanted romantic/sexual interest is to often percived by bystenders as \"compliment\".

But in real life, there often is no one to defend them \u2014 otherwise it wouldn\u2019t be that big of an issue, and no one would be attacking them in the first place.
