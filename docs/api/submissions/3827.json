I have chosen not to date or seek another romantic partner and that is something I have been vocal about with family and friends. I do not want to date and please do not attempt to set me up.\n\nAlmost a year ago my sister's best friend lost her husband. Within 7 months she was reaching out to me to talk and almost right away told me she wanted us to be together. She said we would understand each other and her kids needed a dad and she would be a good mom to my now adult children. I told her that I was not interested in a romantic relationship and if she wanted that, she needed to find someone else.\n\nShe has not backed off. She has attempted to introduce me to her children and she has asked to meet my children. One day she showed up at my house when my youngest was home and she was trying to convince him we had something going on between us. She made both my son and I very uncomfortable. \n\nTwo months ago I purchased a smaller house for myself which I call my grandpa house because I am about to be a grandpa and can have my grandchildren over but it's less daunting when I'm alone. She wanted to know why I was making big life changes and downsizing when her kids are still young.\n\nMy sister is aware of what is going on. I have told her. I have asked her to help me get her friend to stop. She thinks the idea is a good one and encouraged me to give her friend a chance because \"two widows together makes sense\". So she has been no help. She was supposed to host a big family Christmas this year and she's also someone who throws regular dinner parties. Her friend is always there now and so I told my sister I would no longer be attending these gatherings while her friend is invited. My sister told me I was being unfair expecting her to not include her friend. I told her she is welcome to include her but she makes me uncomfortable so I am deciding not to include myself. She also believes I am being cruel to her friend who knows I always attend and now she sees me not and that Christmas will be the biggest insult.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670058671, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbc6qc/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_will_no_longer_be/", "score": 2128, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She doesn't appear to be handling the loss of her spouse well, and I am not trained to be the support she needs.\" Hopefully by then friend gets enough help to see how wrong she is being", "NTA. Your sister's friend isn't the AH either. She's grieving and, from the sound of it, likely being encouraged in her delusional pursuit of you by your sister, who *is* the AH.\n\nYou don't state how old your sister is but she's certainly old enough to know what boundaries are and how to respect them.

However, you are not him and never will be. Even if you were to enter a relationship with this woman, it wouldn\u2019t be what she wanted and DEFINITELY nothing you would want. She needs to slow down and allow herself to grieve the loss of the man she loved and actually sit with it. Depending on how young her kids are, she should be using this time to help her kids with the grieving process as well. Adding another father figure within a year of him passing can be a very jarring thing for children at some ages, especially if they don\u2019t have a concept of death. I hope she gets help from someone who can truly get her to a better place.
