{"id": 18211, "submission_id": "13savby", "title": "AITA for saying I'll be driving myself and paying for my own room on the upcoming family vacation so I won't have to be a babysitter?", "selftext": "I 23m was repeatedly stuck playing the part of helper and babysitter on family outings. I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.\n\nThis year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the \"Buts\" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.\n\nMy parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.\n\nNow my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.\n\nEdit: It's barely been an hour since I posted. But my sister is apparently a reddit lurker in the mornings, and she saw my post. Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. To make it short, she went on a big rant about how it's so hard to be a parent to triplets. And the least I could do is help because I'm young and single, and she needs a break. I stood my ground on my decision, and now she's calling our parents to get them involved. I'm expecting a call from them any minute. \n\nUpdate: Well I'm off work now, so I can tell more of what went down. I guess you could say it's over. My sister got our parents involved, they looked at my post, and were absolutely horrified by the continuous influx of commenters. Yes they're very angry with me that I posted here. But I told them that if they'd just listened to me to begin with, I'd have never needed to. I'm sick of the whole keep the peace mentality that sacrifices me to placate my sister. They in turn went off on my sister, and to make a long story short the whole vacation has been canceled. The hotel wasn't booked yet anyway. But my parents are arguing with my sister, my sister is blaming me, and my nephews are crying because they aren't going to the beach. My sister called me at lunch and basically implied I have no life, which is why I have time to help. I recorded that and told our parents, and that's currently what they're fighting about. \n\nI sincerely thank everyone here for all the advice. But I don't think I'll need to update again.", "created_utc": 1685101391, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13savby/aita_for_saying_ill_be_driving_myself_and_paying/", "score": 22260, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's admitting she's ruining *your* vacation so as not to ruin her own! They're *her* kids and *her* responsibility. \n\nNTA. In fact, you're nicer than *I* would be; I'd just say \"no thanks; I've got other plans\" and avoid the family vacation altogether.", "NTA but if you are paying for yourself go somewhere else on your own to make it a hard no to babysitting", "NTA  Do not give in.  It's time to stand your ground.  This internet stranger is proud of you.\n\nHoly shit.  Never in the history of AItA has there been such a clear-cut case of Golden Child and Scapegoat, and I've seen some doozies.\n\n>I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too.\n\nCorrect.  Honestly, what are you getting out of these family vacations?  Just go do your own thing and avoid the hassle and stress and pressure to babysit.", "Nta.  Your sister can pay a babysitter to come on the vacation if she doesn\u2019t want to deal with her 3 children.\nPersonally, I wouldn\u2019t even go bc even in a separate hotel room, they aren\u2019t going to leave you alone about this.  They feel very entitled for your babysitting services.", "NTA. It's four persons for three boys, if they need more help they can hire a nanny. Plus: claps to your sister, she trapped you in free babysitting by making your parents pay your room. Wow the entitlement is real", "NTA. Your sister is behaving like she's entitled to your time and attention whenever she wants it. You're not her babysitter. If she doesn't want to look after them, she shouldn't have had them.\n\nYour parents are just as guilty. They're leaning on you \"to keep the peace\" because they know you're the more reasonable of their two children and the one most likely to give in.\n\nYou can pay your own way and go do whatever you want, of course. You could also consider just not going on this \"family\" holiday and book somewhere else that you want to go to instead. I say that because your parents and sister WILL still try to force her children onto you if you're there.\n\nI think this is about more than the holiday. They don't respect you as an adult. They still see you as someone lesser than they can boss around. If I were you, I'd be drawing my line in the sand", "NTA. And at this point, I would personally be saying \"Okay, you guys have collectively made it very clear that I'm not wanted as adult company but only as free childcare. I think we would all be better taking a break from that dynamic in the interests of preserving family feeling, and so I will not come on this year's vacation at all. I wish you guys all the best, but I will be vacationing alone somewhere else this year.\"\n\nAlso? Tell your parents that you can't keep the peace when someone else is responsible for breaking it - your sister's determined steamrollering of your time and goodwill is not something that you can just lie down and take forever. She is a parent and it's her job to care for her own children. Even on vacation. If someone does her the favour of helping out, then she owes them gratitude for the gift, not taking their help for granted and assuming she can force them to sacrifice their entire vacation time. No-one owes her that sacrifice. And no, she doesn't get to palm the kids off on other people overnight, either.", "NTA a million times over. If they keep giving you shit, I wouldn\u2019t even go. If you do, stay firm when your sister inevitably tries dumping the kids on you. Or send her links to a babysitting service that\u2019s local to where you\u2019ll be going. Tell your parents they can use the money they were going to spend on you for a babysitter for your sister.", "So if you're there in any capacity other than as a babysitter, you're \"ruining the vacation\"??  \n\nWow, way to make you feel valued. Way to make you feel like part of the family. Way to tell you exactly how they feel about you.\n\nI would absolutely not go, and would not discuss anything to do with it.\n\nIf I was feeling particularly petty, I'd agree to go but insist on driving by myself. Then just never show up.  You wouldn't need to feel guilty - it's not like they were actually paying to put you in your own room, so there's no extra expense. Plus they get to spend time with their kids - you know, a good family vacation.", "BRAVO!!! Well done!  You win!  Finally, someone that knows the exact solution required, and stands their ground without being savage about it.\n\nI am so proud of you.  I am so happy for you, I am feeling a little better as I start my day knowing you have figured out your needs and are enforcing clear boundaries with your presumptuous sister, and your enabling parents who apparently found the need to run to her and tell on you, instead of shut her unreasonable demands down.  They're her kids, not yours.  You work hard, you earned this vacation.  Enjoy your freedom.\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA", "NTA.

As a mom of 3 rowdy boys myself, you aren\u2019t doing anything wrong. \n\nYour sister is a parent, so it\u2019s her job vacation or not to parent her kids. \n\nYou\u2019re child free and should be allowed to enjoy your vacation without being a babysitter. \n\nYour sisters vacation is only ruined by her choice to have children.", "NTA I'd strongly advise staying in a different hotel. I've seen people get screwed over too often in my day to not plan for the what-ifs. What if your lovely family knocks, drops off kids, and runs, leaving you saddled with children you had no part in the making of.\n\nKeep your foot down. Don't let them manipulate you. One can love their family, and still say no.\n\n(Edited for spelling error)", "NTA \n\nIf she wants a break from the kids she and her husband should go on a separate vacation and ask your parents/you/a babysitter to take care of the kids while they're away instead of hijacking the family vacation... stupid lol", "NTA You shouldn\u2019t have to go through such great lengths to not be the designated babysitter anyway. It was ridiculous that the kids were staying with you, rather than the parents who decided to have them. Good for sticking up for yourself.", "NTA \nYou have every right to enjoy your own vacation.  You are not the babysitter or the parent.", "NTA.  Sister needs to manage arrangements for her own family and not dump all parenting responsibilities on OP.  Classic case of \"fool me once...\" and OP learned from experience.  No one is ruining anything here except for sister and the parents who are enabling her entitle tantrum.", "NTA, they're peeved because they will have to look after their kids themselves instead of loading them onto you.  If their complaints get worse, had you thought of going on vacation by yourself to a different place?", ">Not only is she furious with me. But she's also upset no one in the comments is siding with her. \n\nHey sis you're the asshole.  You chose to get pregnant with 3 boys.  Its not your brother's job to babysit.  Be a proper mother and do whats required to take care of your own children.  Your brother chose to not have children and doesnt need to be burdened with your 3 unruly children but on top of that your guilt tripping him into watching your kids and lastly, ruining his vacation by being yoru free childcare.  \n\nYour brother is getting the short end of the stick here while you walk with your chin higher than your nose and expect him to bow to you.  Grow up and take responsibility for the mess you created.  If you need childcare, pay for it.

OP when your parents call, ask them why they do this?\n\nOP, you are NTA but your sister & parents are absolutely the assholes.  Why are you even going on this vacation with these people will be miserable towards you and angry that you stood up for yourself?

And I understand how stressful kids can be. I don\u2019t even like asking people for help with my kids because of how stressful it can be.

I\u2019m a parent, and I would never do that to someone else.", "NTA.honestly, I wouldn't even go on vacation with them. you should find your own thing to do. Don't let anyone make you do shit you don't want to. also sounds like they only want you to come just for babysitting.", "NTA!!!!! and boy am I laughing hard right now!

Imagine this: \"take them just this night, your sister and her husband need a quiet night\" or some bs like that.", "NTA. Stand your ground, and tell them it's this way, or you won't go. As for your sister please charge her for any and all babysitting you provide to that ingrate.", "NTA. First they\u2019re her kids, if she wants time away from them she can pay for it. Hotels in vacation spots usually have kids clubs or nanny services. Second she chose to have kids not you. Why would she be entitled to you sacrificing your own vacation? It\u2019s not a vacation if you constantly have to babysit kids! And I say that as a proud auntie of two.

Have fun. Enjoy yourself.", "NTA.  Your sister\u2019s children are your sister\u2019s responsibility. \n\nWhen people bring their nannies on vacation, they pay for both their hotel stay and their salaries.

I had to move out of my parents' house because I kept being forced to help watch my three nephews. Last year we took a family vacation in summer to the coast. I rode along with my parents, and they paid for my hotel room. Only, I had to share that room with three rowdy boys because my sister and her husband wanted a room to themselves. I was promised time to do my own things on the vacation. But instead I ended up having to help with these kids. I complained to everyone about it, and was reminded I was there for free. And then we pretty much just did only one thing I wanted to do. Which was tour an art gallery. I like doing this whenever I'm at the coast. But the kids find it boring.\n\nThis year my parents have a beach trip planned for June. And they assumed I'd be riding along the same way as last year. But I refused. I said I'd be driving myself, and paying for my own hotel stay to have my own room. My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost. I said it was no worry. I've got a good job and a decent running car. I can more than afford it. That's when the \"Buts\" started. I stated the previously listed things as why I'll be driving myself and paying for myself. I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.\n\nMy parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys. I ended up yelling at her that last year all she did was rope me into her mess. I didn't really get to do much of anything I wanted to do. And I was treated like the bad guy for wanting to just go to an art gallery. I'm a grown man. I deserve my own vacation too. \n\nNow my sister is not speaking to me, and my parents are still trying to convince me to just ride with them to keep the peace. I'm still refusing. But the pressure is getting to me. AITA for not giving in? I know they'll have a pretty hard time when they won't have another person there to help.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Block their numbers for awhile (put them in time-out).\n\nBottom line - you are fighting to establish yourself as a real, independent adult (as opposed to the 'scape goat' who exists solely to serve everyone else).  They're going to fight hard to keep you there, but you've got to fight harder.  It will get ugly and you'll most likely have to go low to no contact with them for awhile.  In the end it's up to them to chose to adjust.  Stay strong.\n\nOh, and sister?  Grow up and take care of your own kids.  Your problem is that you are still putting yourself above your kids.

Taking responsibility and control for your own needs is exactly the right thing to do here.  \n\n*My parents were shocked, and tried to remind me of the cost.*\n\nBecause they don't want to say the real reason for their treatment of you out loud.  They know this is wrong to do to you, and they are trying to find other reasons, not the real ones, for manipulating you back into the old patterns where you get to be the unpaid labor so the rest of them can have a vacation.  Maybe they should hire a real nanny, instead of treating you with such blatant disrespect. \n\n*I want to be able to enjoy this vacation as an adult, and not be treated like a child like last year.*  \n\nTreated worse than a child.  Treated like a servant with no rights.  Nannies get time off, and are paid.  You got expectations and disrespect, and not even paid for it.  **It's not a vacation** ***for you*****, when you have no control over your own choices, and are treated like labor, not like family that is equal to the rest** of them.\n\n*My parents told my sister, and she called to blow up at me that I'll be ruining the vacation if I'm off doing my own thing while she has to wrangle her three boys.* \n\nYou wouldn't be ruining the vacation.

Demanding you take care of them all for the whole vacation, and pretending that your section of a room being paid is a reasonable payment?  That's ridiculous.

It is.  And asking is how to solve this.  Not demanding.  Not manipulating. Not treating your siblings like they are yours to control and order around.  **You aren't her co parent, and you weren't involved in her decisions to have kids.

Forcing your compliance by emotional abuse is wrong.  Forcing your compliance with manipulation is wrong.  Working together to find a solution, and asking what you might be able to do to help, that's normal.  Accepting your boundaries for how you are able and willing to help, that's normal.

I just don't get people who haven't fully digested that  having kids means you should assume you will do all the care until they reach adulthood. \n\nMaking assumptions about other people's time and goodwill is beyond rude and frankly selfish.

That's because they take it so personal and are disgusting in their attitudes towards child free people: judgmental, condescending, invasive of privacy, giving unsolicited advice, making demands, name calling and even accusations of Satanism and devil worship. All from the same kind of people who would vote against public health care options, reproductive rights, family leave, affordable housing...

Like if we go out to eat she would offer to cover my meal, or if I have to buy anything for my nephew they will offer to reimburse me. Never once have I felt like I was unappreciated or taken advantage of, which is why I'm willing to help then out in a pinch if needed.\n\nLike yeah I get that parenting is hard. But no one out there is entitled to free childcare at the expense of others.
