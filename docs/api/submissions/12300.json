Once you have the total amount, divide it by the number of bedrooms you're renting out. By-the-bedroom cost is standard in rental places (i.e. a 2 bd always costs more than a 1 bd in the same area and similar type places). Cousin should be paying double the sister if he has two bd.

Prob a total of 4-5 months of the year and goes on EI for the rest of the year without trying to look for a job.\"\n\nSo, I don't think you're wrong to raise the rent to something more in line with local prices, but this particular part of your post bothered me, because  you seem to think your husband's cousin is going onto unemployment and not working more so he can afford to pay you more because he's lazy or refuses to work. By \"summer and some of the fall months\", it sounds to me like cousin is working a seasonal agricultural job, which does have a limited run of when crops can be harvested and processed. It's *very* common in that field to hire on work crews for the season, lay them off during the off-season during which they're eligible to collect unemployment, and bring them back when the season starts back up again, and start and end dates are very much dependent on that year's crop. Now, maybe he can find a different seasonal position with dates opposite his current one, but very few non-agricultural employers are going to want to hire someone on for a regular position only to have them fuck off to another job for several months at a time. That's not to say it can't be done, especially if you guys live in a college town where employers are used to people  coming in for a few months between semesters and don't expect them to stick it out for a full year. I'm just saying it may be more difficult, and not just down to the cousin being lazy as you seem to imply. What cousin *can* do, since a lot of these seasonal ag positions involve overtime and lots of hours during the season, is plan his savings better during the season in order to supplement his budget during the off season. My position in the ag industry is now year round, but during seasonal rush when we're working 7 days a week and there's no time off to blow your paycheck at the bar or vacations or whatever, I can easily bank 15k or more over the season, allowing me to be more generous with my off season budget and spending.\n\nNTA, and you should definitely sit down with your husband and then the two of you with the cousin to find a more fair rent price, but don't go into it with this attitude that cousin is \"lazy and just doesn't want to work\".", "If you want him to do the yard work, *ask*.

If the second employer is used to working with a population like college students who comes and goes according to the semester schedule, great, but those jobs may not always be available in the same areas. Plus you have to figure in logistics like transport and what to do if if the schedule for one job overlaps another. As I said, it's often easier for seasonal agricultural workers to bust their asses 4 or 5 months out of the year, save against the off season lack/lowering of pay, and be available to work again when the crop is ready.
