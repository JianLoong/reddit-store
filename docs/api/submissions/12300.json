Prior to this he was living in the 1 basement suite of our previous house, for $800 (we rented it out for $1300 as soon as he moved out with us). \n\nMy husband wants to charge him so little because \u201ches family and he can\u2019t afford more\u201d However, since the cousin has lived with us these past few years he only works for the summer months and some of the fall months. Prob a total of 4-5 months of the year and goes on EI for the rest of the year without trying to look for a job. I understand he is family but this kind of bothers me as he is a 36 yo man that does not feel like working and we\u2019re losing out on large rental income that could help with our bills. We are not well off by any means. We work very hard and have middle class jobs. \n\nAnother thing that bothers me is that my husband and I maintain our big beautiful yard and the cousin has even made comments to me how he is not responsible for helping with yard work (even though he spends a lot of time outside enjoying that yard and I also never even asked him to help with yard work). You\u2019d think for such a discounted rate he\u2019d be willing to help out a bit (again we\u2019ve never asked this of him). He also made statements to me in the past how he \u201cpays the mortgage\u201d for us. Which is not nearly true. \n\nAdditionally, now my younger sister (f21) got a job offer in our city and we coincidentally we will have that previous $1300 basement suite for rent. I want to help her out by renting it cheaper. However, financially we can\u2019t offer much of a discounted rental rate mostly due to my husbands cousin pretty much getting a $1000 dollar discount on rent each month. \n\nI don\u2019t want my little sister renting out a 1 bedroom $1300 suite while his 36 yo adult cousin rents out a huge 2 bedroom $1050 basement suite.
