Your husband is brainwashed by his parents, who have infantilized him to the point where he never went through the normal individuation process young adults undergo. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t see that there\u2019s a problem, you may need to break it down in very simple terms\u2026either he creates boundaries with his parents or he loses you.

That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re doing something right. \n\nThis is going to be hard, and your husband may never muster the resources necessary to break free of his parents\u2019 control.
