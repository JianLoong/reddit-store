You wouldnt, for example, go to *hug* someone in a super expensive white dress with a glass of red wine in your hand. Its fairly common sense to put your drink down before going over to congratulate people.  If she wanted to make that common sense into a spoken rule (for everyone) thats a bit antsy but not super bad. \n\n\"Approaches\" and \"anything in her hand\" is where it gets weird. Is your mum allowed to sit at a table with you with a drink? Is she allowed to carry water in your vicinity? What if you two approach her, does she have to throw it out? Very OTT and not fair at all. \n\nIt is also punishing her for what happened many years ago when she was a teenager.

She also has to understand that she's playing right into your mother's belief that people have to cater to her anxiety, which is only going to sour the relationship between them further.\n\nYTA", "Oh, I would do it, but like I said, it wouldn't improve my opinion of Annie. If Annie is concerned that, \"MIL doesn't love me\", and wants to improve her relationship with her MIL, then accusing her MIL of imaginary things that MIL might do or did do to someone else in different circumstances 30 years ago is not the way to do it.   Many people did stupid things as teenagers that they never did again after they got to be adults and 25 or 30 years had gone by.  The mom was romantically obsessed with the father. Is Annie implying that the mother is so obsessed with OP that she sees Annie as a rival for OP's love & wants to hurt Annie? That's just gross, and it's something they should sort out before they marry.", "It is a lot to ask. It implies that OP\u2019s mother would spill a drink on her and OP\u2019s mother says that she would never do that. OP\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t deserve to be defined by this one incident that happened before her son and DIL were even born.", "Your granddad brought your mom to your father's first wedding.\n\nAre you making this stuff up?", "Bruh lol wtf is up with your family", "I still think you have the wrong person solving Annie's problem. Judging by how hurt you say your mother is, she has learned her lesson about how cruel that is.", "Sounds like your mom should understand having thoughts that clash with reality. \nSeriously, I recommend therapy for yourself. \nYou grew up as a son of a stalker. Just because your father got a ring on his finger instead of getting run over with a car doesn't change the fact that your mom is unhinged. And your father isn't a good person. Even if we don't focus on the age thing, he cheated on his first wife, most likely, with a person who humiliated her in front of her whole family and friends. Then, he left her and married her bully. And then he had kids with the unhinged person. I guess there's nothing yummier for a man than a mentally ill person whose whole illness just fuels their ego. \nYou could try and explain to your fiance that your mom is obsessed with your father, so Annie is in the clear.", "Idk you and your relationship with your mother, but pouring wine on someone's wedding dress at 16 is not someone who naturally gets attention. I know you've said Annie is in therapy but are you?", "Lol, maybe. But the idea that dad could well have only been a few years older than OP's mum is perfectly feasible.", "We often are attracted to people that remind us of our parents\u2026 Even if it\u2019s subconscious", "She has anxiety  , Annie can snap out of it just because it sounds unrealistic to other ppl .Obviously they don't understand how anxiety works .I  bet if Annie could snap out if it she would,  anxiety is not fun at all .", "You obviously don't understand how anxiety works. It's actually not much too ask,  she has a problem , she's doing therapy,  they should be more understanding. Anxiety like other mental illnesses can be crushing .I guess ppl these days just don't want to be inconvenienced by anything , how dare she ask for a simple request .", "lmao imagine defining someone by something they did at 16. I do like how you added the piece of fiction about him cheating though. Nice touch trying to make the ex into some huge victim", "what are you even talking about? You don't think people looked at her and talked about her when she did that? Also are you really defining someone's entire life by what they did at 16? I'm not even saying she is a good person, but she has a lot of charisma, interesting career, and grew up being paraded around because she got so much attention. She absolutely does command a room for better or worse.", "So play this out. A 16 year old is infatuated with an 18 year old, hounds him throughout his entire first marriage, something happens blah blah blah now he is married to her, they have a kid that they have a crappy relationship with, dad seems to be out of the picture, mom is right now crying because her relationship with her son is not so great and her soon to be daughter-in-law sees right through her.", "I understand exactly how anxiety works. Not only do I have a degree in psychology but I also suffer from anxiety myself. My anxiety is so bad that I have to take sleeping pills just to get a good nights rest and half the time they don\u2019t even work. One of the things I\u2019ve learned in my studies and in therapy is that you can\u2019t allow mental health issues to call the shots. Doing that guarantees that you won\u2019t get better.", "He also said that his mom wasn't a mom at all because she only focused on her husband their whole life. And I wouldn't be defining her by the thing she did at 16 if she then dropped it. Alas, years later, she's married to her obsession.", "Parading around is not the same thing as naturally drawing attention I don't even understand what kind of presence you're trying to convey for your mother.", "I mean that people that naturally get attention are not the same kind of people that literally steal attention by doing things like pouring wine on a bridge at her wedding. You're pretty contradictory with how you talk about your mother I'm wondering if you have a full scope of her or if your feelings are clouded because of your own complicated relationship.", "I don't know where you are getting any of this from. If you read the post, my dad is obviously still in the picture and married to her. They are very happy and I never even implied they weren't. My mom has never cried over our relationship not being great. she was a mostly disinterested mother and content to let nannies raise us.", "Fan fiction.", "My grandfather had three kids and paraded her around because she was some sort of trophy to him, because everyone loved her and she got all the attention. I don't even know what you are talking about, good or bad, people tend to love her and I do get why annie feels like she never gets a moment to be in the spotlight when my mom is around", "She didn't do it for attention. She did it because she was a troubled kid and in her mind this woman took something from her. Fucked up situation, but it has absolutely no bearing on the fact she gets a lot of attention.", "You're making some really weird justifications for your mom's actions. Of course your mom did it for attention. She was jealous and thought the bride was stealing her man. There's nothing about her actions that wasn't attention seeking. Everything you've said about your mom makes it sounds like she's a narcissistic manipulator and you just keep coming up with crappy excuses why she's not even though your own relationship is \"lukewarm?\" Something definitely doesn't add up here", "ok keep making your wrong assumptions. I don't really care, but it is pretty gross to label someone with a personality disorder for something they did at 16.", "Ok so it's not just that. You don't get into specifics but from you comments your mom\n\n-poured wine on a brides wedding dress\n-is extremely spoiled\n-gives her opinions on y'all's stuff when it's not wanted\n-has expressed that your wife is to boring and quiet\n-was a shitty parent who prioritized her prize over her children\n\n\nAlso you can say it's a wrong assumption, but honestly you seem very washy when it comes to your mom alternating between condemning her actions and defending them. Idk something's not clear here.", "Yes, she is spoiled. She is allowed to be. Her husband wants to spoil her and she isn't asking anything from me. The opinions are annoying and I've told her to shut up, but most parents do that at some point. She did tell me Annie is boring, but only when I asked her in private and brought up Annie's feelings about her. She was a shitty parent and we aren't close, but I think it is disgusting to define her whole life by something she did at 16 years old when every adult in her life had failed her."]}
