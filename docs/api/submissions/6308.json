You wouldnt, for example, go to *hug* someone in a super expensive white dress with a glass of red wine in your hand. Its fairly common sense to put your drink down before going over to congratulate people.  If she wanted to make that common sense into a spoken rule (for everyone) thats a bit antsy but not super bad. \n\n\"Approaches\" and \"anything in her hand\" is where it gets weird. Is your mum allowed to sit at a table with you with a drink? Is she allowed to carry water in your vicinity? What if you two approach her, does she have to throw it out? Very OTT and not fair at all. \n\nIt is also punishing her for what happened many years ago when she was a teenager.

She also has to understand that she's playing right into your mother's belief that people have to cater to her anxiety, which is only going to sour the relationship between them further.\n\nYTA", "Oh, I would do it, but like I said, it wouldn't improve my opinion of Annie. If Annie is concerned that, \"MIL doesn't love me\", and wants to improve her relationship with her MIL, then accusing her MIL of imaginary things that MIL might do or did do to someone else in different circumstances 30 years ago is not the way to do it.   Many people did stupid things as teenagers that they never did again after they got to be adults and 25 or 30 years had gone by.  The mom was romantically obsessed with the father. Is Annie implying that the mother is so obsessed with OP that she sees Annie as a rival for OP's love & wants to hurt Annie? That's just gross, and it's something they should sort out before they marry.", "It is a lot to ask. It implies that OP\u2019s mother would spill a drink on her and OP\u2019s mother says that she would never do that. OP\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t deserve to be defined by this one incident that happened before her son and DIL were even born.", "Your granddad brought your mom to your father's first wedding.\n\nAre you making this stuff up?", "Bruh lol wtf is up with your family", "I still think you have the wrong person solving Annie's problem. Judging by how hurt you say your mother is, she has learned her lesson about how cruel that is.", "Sounds like your mom should understand having thoughts that clash with reality. \nSeriously, I recommend therapy for yourself. \nYou grew up as a son of a stalker. Just because your father got a ring on his finger instead of getting run over with a car doesn't change the fact that your mom is unhinged. And your father isn't a good person. Even if we don't focus on the age thing, he cheated on his first wife, most likely, with a person who humiliated her in front of her whole family and friends. Then, he left her and married her bully. And then he had kids with the unhinged person. I guess there's nothing yummier for a man than a mentally ill person whose whole illness just fuels their ego. \nYou could try and explain to your fiance that your mom is obsessed with your father, so Annie is in the clear.", "Idk you and your relationship with your mother, but pouring wine on someone's wedding dress at 16 is not someone who naturally gets attention. I know you've said Annie is in therapy but are you?", "Lol, maybe. But the idea that dad could well have only been a few years older than OP's mum is perfectly feasible.", "We often are attracted to people that remind us of our parents\u2026 Even if it\u2019s subconscious", "She has anxiety  , Annie can snap out of it just because it sounds unrealistic to other ppl .Obviously they don't understand how anxiety works .I  bet if Annie could snap out if it she would,  anxiety is not fun at all .", "You obviously don't understand how anxiety works. It's actually not much too ask,  she has a problem , she's doing therapy,  they should be more understanding. Anxiety like other mental illnesses can be crushing .I guess ppl these days just don't want to be inconvenienced by anything , how dare she ask for a simple request .", "lmao imagine defining someone by something they did at 16. I do like how you added the piece of fiction about him cheating though. Nice touch trying to make the ex into some huge victim", "what are you even talking about? You don't think people looked at her and talked about her when she did that? Also are you really defining someone's entire life by what they did at 16? I'm not even saying she is a good person, but she has a lot of charisma, interesting career, and grew up being paraded around because she got so much attention. She absolutely does command a room for better or worse.", "So play this out. A 16 year old is infatuated with an 18 year old, hounds him throughout his entire first marriage, something happens blah blah blah now he is married to her, they have a kid that they have a crappy relationship with, dad seems to be out of the picture, mom is right now crying because her relationship with her son is not so great and her soon to be daughter-in-law sees right through her.", "I understand exactly how anxiety works. Not only do I have a degree in psychology but I also suffer from anxiety myself. My anxiety is so bad that I have to take sleeping pills just to get a good nights rest and half the time they don\u2019t even work. One of the things I\u2019ve learned in my studies and in therapy is that you can\u2019t allow mental health issues to call the shots. Doing that guarantees that you won\u2019t get better.", "He also said that his mom wasn't a mom at all because she only focused on her husband their whole life. And I wouldn't be defining her by the thing she did at 16 if she then dropped it. Alas, years later, she's married to her obsession.", "Parading around is not the same thing as naturally drawing attention I don't even understand what kind of presence you're trying to convey for your mother.", "I mean that people that naturally get attention are not the same kind of people that literally steal attention by doing things like pouring wine on a bridge at her wedding. You're pretty contradictory with how you talk about your mother I'm wondering if you have a full scope of her or if your feelings are clouded because of your own complicated relationship.", "I don't know where you are getting any of this from. If you read the post, my dad is obviously still in the picture and married to her. They are very happy and I never even implied they weren't. My mom has never cried over our relationship not being great. she was a mostly disinterested mother and content to let nannies raise us.", "Fan fiction.", "My grandfather had three kids and paraded her around because she was some sort of trophy to him, because everyone loved her and she got all the attention. I don't even know what you are talking about, good or bad, people tend to love her and I do get why annie feels like she never gets a moment to be in the spotlight when my mom is around", "She didn't do it for attention. She did it because she was a troubled kid and in her mind this woman took something from her. Fucked up situation, but it has absolutely no bearing on the fact she gets a lot of attention.", "You're making some really weird justifications for your mom's actions. Of course your mom did it for attention. She was jealous and thought the bride was stealing her man. There's nothing about her actions that wasn't attention seeking. Everything you've said about your mom makes it sounds like she's a narcissistic manipulator and you just keep coming up with crappy excuses why she's not even though your own relationship is \"lukewarm?\" Something definitely doesn't add up here", "ok keep making your wrong assumptions. I don't really care, but it is pretty gross to label someone with a personality disorder for something they did at 16.", "Ok so it's not just that. You don't get into specifics but from you comments your mom\n\n-poured wine on a brides wedding dress\n-is extremely spoiled\n-gives her opinions on y'all's stuff when it's not wanted\n-has expressed that your wife is to boring and quiet\n-was a shitty parent who prioritized her prize over her children\n\n\nAlso you can say it's a wrong assumption, but honestly you seem very washy when it comes to your mom alternating between condemning her actions and defending them. Idk something's not clear here.", "Yes, she is spoiled. She is allowed to be. Her husband wants to spoil her and she isn't asking anything from me. The opinions are annoying and I've told her to shut up, but most parents do that at some point. She did tell me Annie is boring, but only when I asked her in private and brought up Annie's feelings about her. She was a shitty parent and we aren't close, but I think it is disgusting to define her whole life by something she did at 16 years old when every adult in her life had failed her.", ">My mom was extremely spoiled\n\nWas. Apparently still is.\n\n>My dad... is absolutely furious and currently won't even talk to Annie.\n\nHe should have kept his mouth shut. Him telling the \"funny story\" to Annie prior to the wedding is what set all this in motion. My guess is he's currently upset because it's pretty clear he's an AH, and he's trying to deflect blame onto Annie.\n\nYour mom and Annie each have a chance to demonstrate love toward the other. Annie could focus on managing her own anxieties and symptoms rather than insisting on accommodations from other people. Mom could simply agree to not be an AH toward Annie on her wedding day. Like you said, Annie doesn't need the stress. But neither one seems to want to bend. ESH, but your mom and dad seem to suck the most.\n\nDad told the funny story, and your mom seems to need to be the center of attention. She's making this all about her. Your wedding day is the one day of Annie's life when she should be given the most leeway. It's also the one day on which MIL should be especially kind because unnecessary conflict can create permanent rifts within families. Mom needs to remember it will be your wedding day, too. Assuming she loves you, she should make it as stress-free for you as possible regardless of how she feels about Annie.", "I find it WILD that anyone is saying Annie is NTA here. His mother was 16 when the incident occurred and she was chasing her now husband. WTF is Annie to her but her soon to be boring DIL? Sounds like OP doesn\u2019t even like his Mother but yet the parents are footing the bill and they should just go along with this ridiculous request? \n\nThe entitlement is real. OP\u2019s parents owe them nothing in this and I hope they decide to let them pay for their day. \n\nI have diagnosed anxiety and would NEVER even assume other people have to accommodate my warped thinking.", "Omg I thought I was the only one who has anxiety like the gf has \ud83d\ude32\ud83d\ude32\n\nYTA", "What\u2019s the point of therapy if you placate this. Your dad is spot on, your fianc\u00e9 is ridiculous. YTA!", "YTA", "YTA.  \n\nIt sounds like Annie has some irrational fears around this wedding, and wants your mother to bend to demands that everyone (but Annie) knows are irrational.  I don't think Annie is ready to have this wedding as long as she can only manage it if she can dictate weird rules (not boundaries, sorry) that others must obey.\n\nP.S.  If Annie is doing talk therapy only for this level of anxiety with an irrational element, can she also please be evaluated for medication by a qualified psychiatrist?  It's possible that this could make her life a lot easier.", "YTA and your Fianc\u00e9 is too. It a crazy unreasonable request. She needs more help.", "YTA. That request is completely asinine.", "YTA\n\nAnnie is a grown woman making a fuss about something that happened before she was alive. \n\nShe needs to get her anxiety in order. And from what sounds she probably will have more problems if she continues with this nonsense.", "YTA and the fact that your dad is paying for it and still has to suck it up is beyond me.

If you hope to have a relationship with your family going forward I suggest you try some other compromise that is actually a compromise that doesn\u2019t massively hurt someone\u2019s feelings. Are you sure you want a lifetime of your social circles getting smaller and smaller over her demands? No one who might possibly do anything ever allowed in? Eventually that\u2019s everyone, dude. If I was your mother I would skip the wedding and maybe everything else, there would be little point in trying.", "YTA\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9e is so distraught by something that happened before she was born to someone she doesn\u2019t know then she\u2019s not in a stable enough place to be making as huge a life decision as getting married.", "As someone with a horrible anxiety disorder I had to learn how to make situations ok for myself without expecting people to accommodate me. Annie suffers from a cognitive distortion called Catastrophizing. As a therapist I treat that almost on a daily basis because it\u2019s so common. It\u2019s absolutely possible to use cognitive behavioral therapy to treat and eliminate this distortion. Entertaining it makes the problem worse. I don\u2019t know how long Annie had been in therapy or the style of therapy that her therapist uses so I\u2019m not going to judge.", "YTA this is Annie's issue, and she needs to figure out a way to get around it.  If you indulge this, what's next?", "NTA your 16 yo mom was at his first wedding spilling on the bride on purpose? I wouldn't want her with food or drink near me, either. The ask was small", "NTA-but your idea on boundaries is wrong.\n\nYour fiance can have boundary that she does not want your mom near her with anything in her hand, but they your fiance needs to enforce it - meaning walk away.  You are trying to use boundaries to control another person but really boundaries are the limit of our tolerance and we have to exit if they are not complied with (or reasses and decide that the person can cross the boundary)\n\nI think you all need to stop the discussions and just act if this occurs at the wedding", "NTA I actually dont think thats a huge ask, its not coming from no where your mother has done this before, and her wedding day is already going to be stressful especially for someone with anxiety. I dont think its a huge deal.", "NTA, and the bride is entitled to make some requests, but man, this has to throw up some red flags for you. How much irrational stuff are you gonna have to deal with for your life? How many uncomfortable situations is she going to create because of her \u2018phobias\u2019 ? This is someone you are going to be catering to for the entirety of your marriage to them.", "I would just uninvited her if I was your fianc\u00e9 bc it\u2019s not worth the risk and especially since there\u2019s no close relationship. NTA", "I meeeean it is safer in general to not be holding food or drink when approaching someone with an expensive outfit, so I don't feel like it's a huge ask? At least for this one day, anyway. I agree with other posters that it's something to be worked on, but you/she already know that and wedding days are stressful enough as it is. NAH.  \nEDIT: Eh, didn't spot the bit where they're paying for the wedding so I can definitely see why it's so hurtful. I don't know that there's any really good solution here, since even if say there's a general policy at the wedding to leave your drinks at your table or something, MIL already knows why that'd be the case.", "Correct , makes me wonder wtf he therapist is teaching her", "She's 53 now lol.", "Have you been to many weddings? What is OP's mother supposed to do, not consume anything at all for the entire day? At weddings, people walk around; OP's mom would have to be constantly keeping her eye on the bride, lest they get too close to each other while the mom sips her drink or eats her food and the bride melts down as a result. No, that's nuts. OP's mother should not have to either act like a paranoid stalker or risk fainting from low blood sugar just because her future DIL is unwilling to seek professional help for her obvious and extreme anxiety.", "24.

Your mom and dad.", "he's kinda both taking her anxiety too seriously and not seriously enough at the same time if that's even possible. lol", "Presumably MIL won't be around the bride before the wedding or the wedding photos.  The concern would be at the reception, when MIL should be allowed to enjoy her dinner and a drink without worrying whether the bride wandering within the \"exclusion zone.\n\nThe other reason that this is completely unworkable is this:\n\n1. If MIL does NOT intend to ruin the wedding, then the demand is insulting.\n2. If MIL DOES intend to ruin the wedding, then her promise is worth nothing anyway.\n\nPresuming MIL has learned at least a little restraint in the last 30 years, most likely the demand is insulting.  But even if bride is right about MIL, the demand is useless.", "Then why are you hurting your mother?", "Yes, but you can't say \"never\" when she did in fact do exactly that thing. You can say \"she hasn't intentionally destroyed a wedding in over 30 years\" but you can't she never did it.\n\nAlso, I don't like being judged for things I did in the past either, but that doesn't mean I can claim I didn't do them.", "Except she is still obsessed w/ your father and choose him over her kids. I never wanted kids, but I still find that behavior abhorrent. So after the 1st kid, she had to know she didn't want kids, so why keep having them? To make hubby happy? I'm probably about your mother's age. Birth control was readily available, lots of people were having only 1 child or no children. We even had a term for working couples w/o kids:  DINK - Double Income, No Kids \n\nYes, lots of kids are raised by nannies, but most of th don't come away knowing one of their parents regrets having kids.\n\nI don't know how much your mother has actually changed since she was an obsessive 16 yr old. It sounds like there really wasn't any reason for her to grow up.", "I hear that.\n\nAt the same time, Annie has said that she knows that her experiences with anxiety are causing the concern, and that she knows it's not something your mom would actually do.\n\nSo, it's clear (and admitted by Annie) that it's not actually about your mom, about judging her etc, but it's about Annie. And she's asked that your mom help her keep calm on that day by making an easy adjustment. Like you said, Annie is working on it in therapy, and this isn't a lifetime request, just for the event.\n\nWith that in mind, and the facts that your mom doesn't like Annie that much, and the two of you aren't that close, it seems odd that she'd be that hurt by this. It seems a little selfish, but not out of character for someone who loves being the centre of attention.\n\nI obviously could be completely wrong. \n\nEither way.
