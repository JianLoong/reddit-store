You wouldnt, for example, go to *hug* someone in a super expensive white dress with a glass of red wine in your hand. Its fairly common sense to put your drink down before going over to congratulate people.  If she wanted to make that common sense into a spoken rule (for everyone) thats a bit antsy but not super bad. \n\n\"Approaches\" and \"anything in her hand\" is where it gets weird. Is your mum allowed to sit at a table with you with a drink? Is she allowed to carry water in your vicinity? What if you two approach her, does she have to throw it out? Very OTT and not fair at all. \n\nIt is also punishing her for what happened many years ago when she was a teenager.

And you raised a point I want to ask you on.\n\nThat point is that while Annie is in therapy, her anxiety is not under control.\n\nHas the counselor worked with Annie to develop coping mechanisms to calm her anxiety?  Has she actively used the techniques her counselor gave her?\n\nIf neither of these questions can be answered, then that will partially explain why the anxiety is not under control.\n\nBoundaries are useful when used in a reasonable setting.\n\nYour Mom is hurt because Annie set a boundary out of her own fear and anxiety.\n\nI have caved to my own anxiety before, but with a cool down, I apologize if I responded irrationally with a boundary and find a healthier option than what I sat.\n\nIn the moments I sat those boundaries, my anxiety felt so real.  It felt like a scary monster out to hurt me.\n\nYet, I let my own anxiety control me in those moments, which is not healthy.\n\nOP, Annie's fear is controlling her.  And, from my own experience, it will control others, including you.  It will become a wild dragon difficult to tame that will lead to isolation from others and hurt.\n\nOP, your parents have every right to be hurt.  Yes, Annie has the right to set boundaries, but she sat a boundary that was led by anxiety and you need to talk to Annie about this.  You need to do it in a way that communicates she is safe, but that she herself crossed a line.\n\nPerhaps you can talk to her to reason that your Mom shouldn't hold a drink while dancing.  That would make more logical sense than an outright ban. \n\nAs much as it feels impossible, Annie can learn to control her own anxiety to an extent.  She can learn to control her own fears and emotions.  It will take a lot of work and unpacking from childhood until now, but the attitude that she can't help it is not entirely accurate.\n\nShe is in therapy, which should give her the tools to help her control it.

Wedding prep is a stressful process.  I know that you want it to not be stressful for her, but the reality is that stress due to a wedding is unavoidable.  You can't avoid it or make it go  away.\n\nSo, while money might be lost, doing a small shotgun wedding or postponing the ceremony so she can seek help may be in the best interest of Annie.\n\nOP, I commend you for being willing to love and fight for someone with severe anxiety in closing. Yet, part of loving includes knowing when she is being unreasonable and holding her accountable to use her coping technique.\n\nThe reality is that Annie let her anxiety control her.  You ALL need to sit down and work toward a solution.  Both you and Annie need to apologize for the ban, while your parents need to be understanding how Annie's anxiety is warping her perspective.\n\nIf that doesn't work, be ready for the possibility that your Dad could withdraw financial support because of how both of you reacted to Annie's anxiety.
