The age difference surprises some people but it's fairly common in gay culture + he is a sweet, intelligent, fun-loving man who looks fantastic.\n\nLet's call this boyfriend James. He was married for a few years and while very civil with his ex-wife, they have been divorced for a long time and their marriage - each has admitted - was toxic. They had one son (Junior). James struggled coming out for several years but has proudly been out and proud for a few years prior to us meeting.\n\nJames's son, we will call Junior (Jr), has known about his father's sexuality for years and was polite to me at first but quickly soured after about 6 months when it was clear I was not just a fling.\n\nJunior is a few years older than I am - which was weird at first but I think it's time he gets over it.\n\nJames and I love to travel, try new things, etc. and due to the fact James sets the plans and - let's be frank - its farther along in his career elects to pick up the check 90% of the time. Junior (the son) has started calling me \"the sugar baby\" or just \"the baby\". \n\nI don't cross paths with Junior very often and to keep the peace, simply have to let any negative experiences go to not give James any undue stress.\n\nI know how our relationship looks - and James and I have had many long conversations on the subject. We are both comfortable, having fun, and have great communication.\n\nNOW\n\nJunior (the son) is getting married in a few months. I was not directly invited but James naturally has marked me down as his plus one. Junior is marrying a lovely girl closer to my age. Last week, during a rare dinner that we were all present for, Junior was really nasty to me and made some unkind remarks.\n\nIt is clear that Junior has resentment toward his parents for their divorce, toxic family life early in his life, etc. He also thinks I am trying to weasel my way into the father's life for financial benefit (James built several companies that do really well).\n\nLOOK: I am not without sympathy - if my father started dating someone a few years younger than me - regardless of gender - I would be taken aback and weirded out AT FIRST.\n\nAfter 2 years though it is clear - to all of James' friends and his employees - that I am good for him. He is happier, taking more time away from his businesses, and just overall most pleasent.\n\nI have done my best but I am done being a punching bag at every event the son and I are together at.\n\n**I am refusing to go the wedding and while James is trying to be understanding - he is clearly hurt.**\n\nI have made it clear that I fully support him going or even taking someone else as a date.

If junior doesn't want to see his dad's boy toy at his wedding, you shouldn't go.

We don\u2019t want to be a distraction on your wedding day and OP doesn\u2019t want to feel unwelcome, so what is your preference?

I would not take it well if my dad was economically supporting or was in a relationship with someone my age but that doesn't give the son the right to call you out, this is a discussion he should have with his father.

That\u2019s the best anyone can hope for in a partner.", "NTA - Since Junior has been \u201cnasty\u201d and \u201cunkind\u201d you should not feel obligated to go to his wedding.

You are only with James cause he provides for you and in turns you give him sex. Simple as that!", "NTA  But maybe considering going to support James? I'm not sure how tradtional the wedding will be, but you can always step back for things like the receiving line, family member announcements, etc. If Junior tries to get combative with you (which I hope he will not do at his own wedding), step away. Go outside. But you and James need to have a serious discussion about this.", "NTA\n\nJunior does *not* have to \"get over it\" in regards to his father dating someone younger than him. That is fucked up for any child to have to deal with, and you need to accept that. That doesn't mean he isn't being an AH to you and that your relationship is illegitimate though. Your partner needs to accept that he has caused this problem, to understand why this is so upsetting for his son, and to not let you take the flak for it. He should be protecting you from such comments and should accept that both you and Junior would be happier if you are not at the wedding.", "YTA. You should immediately have a conversation with your partner about this situation. I think your partner NEEDS to have an honest conversation with his son. Being a child of a divorce, acknowledging that your father is gay, and now your father having a partner younger than you, IS A LOT, although it doesn't excuse his treatment towards you. I surely hope that they both are in therapy together. You acknowledge that it would be weird if you were in Juniors position, but can you imagine someone thinking you need to get over it since it has been 2 years? You do deserve to be treated better but there has been no communication to clarify anything and set boundaries. Your partner has done a piss poor job in ensuring a cordial relationship between all three of you. Putting your foot down when your partner has listed you as his plus-one and not attending his son's wedding is selfish and adds fuel to the fire. You put your partner in a weird place and if he decides to not attend his son's wedding in solidarity with you based on NO communication, a relationship will be ruined, resentment will be at an all-time high, you won't look good, and it will negatively impact your relationship. The way we move is so important. There is still time to work on things. Choose how you handle conflict wisely and don't act on emotion. You are already the youngest, any slip-up will be based on immaturity and age.", "Your partner is a grown ass man. Unless he's senile, then it's his informed choice to be with you, and that includes paying for things.\n\nI get why his son doesn't like it but it's been two years and being an asshole to you isn't accomplishing anything except alienating his father. Which is his choice to make, but you're not obligated to take being treated with disrespect.\n\nNTA.", "nope, NTA.  The kid has issues, and will have to work on them at some point.", "NTA", "What is it with people's entitlement to call you sugar baby\ud83e\udd2e. \nAge gaps in the gay community are real...even in Chile which is not so gay friendly.\n\nI sat NTA but I think it's important to say that your partner will always be junior's dad. So for now I think it's better to focus on you enjoying your time with James and to make him happy and let him deal with the son\n\nGood luck with everything\u2665\ufe0f", "NTA", "NTA. Ask James why you should go to an event at which the people being honored do not want you there, one actively insults you, and with alcohol involved, may get more upset.\n\nIf he truly thinks it is a good idea to go, ask him how he will make sure you are not insulted, talked down to, or otherwise treated poorly by his son or his friends.", "NTA cause like you said you do not want to ruin the son's wedding day. It sucks for James but I think there needs to be a definite conversation between James and you cause you two need to be on board and he needs to understand where you are coming from. Not sure if you have had those hard conversations.   \n\n\nAs well as James and his son where he needs to stand up for you and your relationship.  You clearly understand why his son does not approve. His actions are not great and should not be condoned and that is where James needs to step up.   \n\n\nI am just wondering has his son only been around you in instances where James is clearly paying and such. I think the age coupled with the fact that James is the one paying for things most of the time does little to put you in a better light. I think no amount of time passing will really change that because if he sees you as a golddigger he will never change his mind about you if you've been with his dad for 10 years or more. So James really needs to talk it out with him.", "NTA \n\nand you wanna know why\n\nMy mom was 15 when she had me, that means if i date anyone older, or she dates younger, suddenly thats dating someone in her kids age range, that is what many of you are saying, not to date anyone in your kids age range, we need to throw that rule out, it hasnt worked for a while.\n\nTwo, op was a fully formed adult, brain done debeloping, when he and james got together, this means age gap isnt really that important.\n\nThree, op is hardly a sugar baby considering they have a job, pay their own bills ect.\n\nFour, even if op didnt pay for anything, if you say those relationships arent valid, suddenly alot of hetero relationships arent valid since the woman doesnt pay or have a job.\n\nSo in conclusion junior needs to suck it up and start acting like the mature adult he thinks he is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hopefully time will mellow things later.", "You have explained a lot about the financial situation and the enjoyment of time together and how much happier James is.  I have one question or maybe a bridge to cross.\n\nIn your post and responses, there is mention of age difference, relationship with son, the wedding and allowing his son to use as punching bag, not going to wedding, James wanting you to go, how financiall successful James is ..I think that sums it up, now here is my question.\n\nDo you love him? You mentioned that obviously this is not a fling because you've been together for 2 years, but you have not said how much you love James and you can see spending the rest of your life with him. See, you explained a lot about James' life, toxic marriage, and coming out, but not one word about your life. \n\nI think if you want people to respect you and your relationship with James then you should really be honest about being in love with James or love the life you have with James or do you love but not in love with James? \n\nSo, when you come asking if you're the asshole and defend your relationship and talk about how great it is, perhaps your first line before anything is I love him so much, and he makes me happy. It's not about if you make him happy and how much of better mode he is in. Does he make you emotionally happy? You have yet to mention how you feel.\n\nI am married to a man who is 16 years older than me, and when we met, I was 43, and he was 59. He made good money, but I was with him because I love this man to pieces. That's the start of any conversation about us. BTW, about 5 years ago, he retired and only collects social security, and we only get 1/4 of what he used to get.Guess what, I am still here. I am the actual breadwinner, and I still want him. Can you say the same? In 1 paragraph, you can see our age difference means nothing because I talked about the love we have for each other. \n\nSo, again, if you want people to stop concentrating on your age, then talk about your love, not his mode.", "NTA The drama is not worth your happiness. It's stressful, sad and it hurts. Do what is best for you. Life is very short and if something does not make you happy...try to change it.  I remember being young and how very stressful things could become if I let it.", "Why would the son want him at the wedding?", "Don't agree, not going to the wedding may actually improve things.

I am asking with sincere intent to learn/understand your view. Perhaps 30 years is a bit uncommon - but in larger cities and areas with an active gay scene (NY, Boston, Key West, Chicago, etc) I know lots of couples with 20+ year age difference, and many of those have been together for years and years. \n\nAs for \"economic reasons\" I can only state that I pay my own rent and bills (we do not live together yet), I treat for dinner or theatre tickets now and then, etc. If we were dating per my tax bracket it would be a lot of dinners at home and free events.

In OP's position, I would absolutely not go to the wedding. I think OP's boyfriend needs to respect that, and if he has a problem with the situation, it's a discussion he needs to have with his son. \n\nI think there are inherent problems with May-December relationships, especially if there's a lifelong commitment. (OP doesn't say there is.) I've seen older men realize they just don't have that much in common with their younger wives, and younger women realize that it's one thing to be 20 and married to a 50 year old man, and quite another to be 50 and married to an 80 year old man.

Is a thing too among couples without age difference. \nEven married couples. \n\nA sugar baby is pure \"spoil me\" \nThey don't pay for stuff.

Just think about it. It's a smaller dating pool. You're going to accept things you wouldn't in a larger dating pool. Usually age gaps in heterosexual relationship skew towards an older male partner and exacerbate asymmetries-- that effect is blunted with gay guys. \n\nIt's so common that Dan Savage has something called a campground rule: if you're dating a baby gay, treat him like a campground and make sure he comes out of the relationship as nicely treated as he went into it.", "Thanks  for your honesty. \n\nRegarding our future, James and I have actually discussed getting married someday (probably no big wedding - an intimate dinner with close friends and select family).

For very good reasons that I won't get into.  She's now 40, dating a 66 year old man.

Some work, some don\u2019t. Like all types relationships.\n\nI have a close straight friend in his mid 50s who divorced and started dating a woman in her mid 20s (an artist). Big financial discrepancy, but she made him feel so free and happy and he gave her the stability to really enjoy life and pursue her career. 15 years in and they\u2019re both very happy even though high daughter took many years to accept them, but now truly loves them both (but more like sister/dad than mom/dad :))..\n\nDon\u2019t worry about building a relationship with James\u2019s son for awhile.

This would mean I need to put certain projects and goals on hold for a few years. For him, and the joy of seeing where our new adventure might go, I am OK with that -- but it doesn't mean its not a risk on my part. \n\nIf I love him and support him for 20+ years -- yes, I do feel I am entitled to SOME level of protection just like any other marriage would be. I hate defining such things when it comes to love, but the grocery store and electric company don't accept good memories as payment. \n\nHowever, I also would never take away from his child -- and if he was the kind of man who would do that (disinherit his only son), I wouldn't respect or be with him.", "You said never date in your child's age range, that rule doesnt work, because teen parents sre very common", "Who says you have to??
