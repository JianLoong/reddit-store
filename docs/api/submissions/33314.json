The age difference surprises some people but it's fairly common in gay culture + he is a sweet, intelligent, fun-loving man who looks fantastic.\n\nLet's call this boyfriend James. He was married for a few years and while very civil with his ex-wife, they have been divorced for a long time and their marriage - each has admitted - was toxic. They had one son (Junior). James struggled coming out for several years but has proudly been out and proud for a few years prior to us meeting.\n\nJames's son, we will call Junior (Jr), has known about his father's sexuality for years and was polite to me at first but quickly soured after about 6 months when it was clear I was not just a fling.\n\nJunior is a few years older than I am - which was weird at first but I think it's time he gets over it.\n\nJames and I love to travel, try new things, etc. and due to the fact James sets the plans and - let's be frank - its farther along in his career elects to pick up the check 90% of the time. Junior (the son) has started calling me \"the sugar baby\" or just \"the baby\". \n\nI don't cross paths with Junior very often and to keep the peace, simply have to let any negative experiences go to not give James any undue stress.\n\nI know how our relationship looks - and James and I have had many long conversations on the subject. We are both comfortable, having fun, and have great communication.\n\nNOW\n\nJunior (the son) is getting married in a few months. I was not directly invited but James naturally has marked me down as his plus one. Junior is marrying a lovely girl closer to my age. Last week, during a rare dinner that we were all present for, Junior was really nasty to me and made some unkind remarks.\n\nIt is clear that Junior has resentment toward his parents for their divorce, toxic family life early in his life, etc. He also thinks I am trying to weasel my way into the father's life for financial benefit (James built several companies that do really well).\n\nLOOK: I am not without sympathy - if my father started dating someone a few years younger than me - regardless of gender - I would be taken aback and weirded out AT FIRST.\n\nAfter 2 years though it is clear - to all of James' friends and his employees - that I am good for him. He is happier, taking more time away from his businesses, and just overall most pleasent.\n\nI have done my best but I am done being a punching bag at every event the son and I are together at.\n\n**I am refusing to go the wedding and while James is trying to be understanding - he is clearly hurt.**\n\nI have made it clear that I fully support him going or even taking someone else as a date. I am not trying to spoil the big day - but I can't put myself in the firing line again.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702939521, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18llxr8/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_bfs_sons_wedding/", "score": 401, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We don\u2019t want to be a distraction on your wedding day and OP doesn\u2019t want to feel unwelcome, so what is your preference?

I would not take it well if my dad was economically supporting or was in a relationship with someone my age but that doesn't give the son the right to call you out, this is a discussion he should have with his father.

I'm not sure how tradtional the wedding will be, but you can always step back for things like the receiving line, family member announcements, etc. If Junior tries to get combative with you (which I hope he will not do at his own wedding), step away. Go outside. But you and James need to have a serious discussion about this.", "NTA\n\nJunior does *not* have to \"get over it\" in regards to his father dating someone younger than him. That is fucked up for any child to have to deal with, and you need to accept that. That doesn't mean he isn't being an AH to you and that your relationship is illegitimate though. Your partner needs to accept that he has caused this problem, to understand why this is so upsetting for his son, and to not let you take the flak for it. He should be protecting you from such comments and should accept that both you and Junior would be happier if you are not at the wedding.", "YTA. You should immediately have a conversation with your partner about this situation. I think your partner NEEDS to have an honest conversation with his son. Being a child of a divorce, acknowledging that your father is gay, and now your father having a partner younger than you, IS A LOT, although it doesn't excuse his treatment towards you. I surely hope that they both are in therapy together. You acknowledge that it would be weird if you were in Juniors position, but can you imagine someone thinking you need to get over it since it has been 2 years? You do deserve to be treated better but there has been no communication to clarify anything and set boundaries. Your partner has done a piss poor job in ensuring a cordial relationship between all three of you. Putting your foot down when your partner has listed you as his plus-one and not attending his son's wedding is selfish and adds fuel to the fire. You put your partner in a weird place and if he decides to not attend his son's wedding in solidarity with you based on NO communication, a relationship will be ruined, resentment will be at an all-time high, you won't look good, and it will negatively impact your relationship. The way we move is so important. There is still time to work on things. Choose how you handle conflict wisely and don't act on emotion. You are already the youngest, any slip-up will be based on immaturity and age.", "Your partner is a grown ass man. Unless he's senile, then it's his informed choice to be with you, and that includes paying for things.\n\nI get why his son doesn't like it but it's been two years and being an asshole to you isn't accomplishing anything except alienating his father. Which is his choice to make, but you're not obligated to take being treated with disrespect.\n\nNTA.", "nope, NTA.  The kid has issues, and will have to work on them at some point.", "NTA", "What is it with people's entitlement to call you sugar baby\ud83e\udd2e. \nAge gaps in the gay community are real...even in Chile which is not so gay friendly.\n\nI sat NTA but I think it's important to say that your partner will always be junior's dad. So for now I think it's better to focus on you enjoying your time with James and to make him happy and let him deal with the son\n\nGood luck with everything\u2665\ufe0f", "NTA", "NTA. Ask James why you should go to an event at which the people being honored do not want you there, one actively insults you, and with alcohol involved, may get more upset.\n\nIf he truly thinks it is a good idea to go, ask him how he will make sure you are not insulted, talked down to, or otherwise treated poorly by his son or his friends.", "NTA cause like you said you do not want to ruin the son's wedding day. It sucks for James but I think there needs to be a definite conversation between James and you cause you two need to be on board and he needs to understand where you are coming from. Not sure if you have had those hard conversations.   \n\n\nAs well as James and his son where he needs to stand up for you and your relationship.  You clearly understand why his son does not approve. His actions are not great and should not be condoned and that is where James needs to step up.   \n\n\nI am just wondering has his son only been around you in instances where James is clearly paying and such. I think the age coupled with the fact that James is the one paying for things most of the time does little to put you in a better light. I think no amount of time passing will really change that because if he sees you as a golddigger he will never change his mind about you if you've been with his dad for 10 years or more. So James really needs to talk it out with him.", "NTA \n\nand you wanna know why\n\nMy mom was 15 when she had me, that means if i date anyone older, or she dates younger, suddenly thats dating someone in her kids age range, that is what many of you are saying, not to date anyone in your kids age range, we need to throw that rule out, it hasnt worked for a while.\n\nTwo, op was a fully formed adult, brain done debeloping, when he and james got together, this means age gap isnt really that important.\n\nThree, op is hardly a sugar baby considering they have a job, pay their own bills ect.\n\nFour, even if op didnt pay for anything, if you say those relationships arent valid, suddenly alot of hetero relationships arent valid since the woman doesnt pay or have a job.\n\nSo in conclusion junior needs to suck it up and start acting like the mature adult he thinks he is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hopefully time will mellow things later.", "You have explained a lot about the financial situation and the enjoyment of time together and how much happier James is.  I have one question or maybe a bridge to cross.\n\nIn your post and responses, there is mention of age difference, relationship with son, the wedding and allowing his son to use as punching bag, not going to wedding, James wanting you to go, how financiall successful James is ..I think that sums it up, now here is my question.\n\nDo you love him? You mentioned that obviously this is not a fling because you've been together for 2 years, but you have not said how much you love James and you can see spending the rest of your life with him. See, you explained a lot about James' life, toxic marriage, and coming out, but not one word about your life. \n\nI think if you want people to respect you and your relationship with James then you should really be honest about being in love with James or love the life you have with James or do you love but not in love with James? \n\nSo, when you come asking if you're the asshole and defend your relationship and talk about how great it is, perhaps your first line before anything is I love him so much, and he makes me happy. It's not about if you make him happy and how much of better mode he is in. Does he make you emotionally happy? You have yet to mention how you feel.\n\nI am married to a man who is 16 years older than me, and when we met, I was 43, and he was 59. He made good money, but I was with him because I love this man to pieces. That's the start of any conversation about us. BTW, about 5 years ago, he retired and only collects social security, and we only get 1/4 of what he used to get.Guess what, I am still here. I am the actual breadwinner, and I still want him. Can you say the same? In 1 paragraph, you can see our age difference means nothing because I talked about the love we have for each other. \n\nSo, again, if you want people to stop concentrating on your age, then talk about your love, not his mode.", "NTA The drama is not worth your happiness.

(OP doesn't say there is.) I've seen older men realize they just don't have that much in common with their younger wives, and younger women realize that it's one thing to be 20 and married to a 50 year old man, and quite another to be 50 and married to an 80 year old man.

But I also see why James is hurt.", "Nta", "NTA, and hope one day you & \u201cJunior\u201d can work past this. My girl cousin started dating a much older man, and his daughter would always make a comment to make my cousin feel uncomfortable. Cousin\u2019s bf was tired of it and finally confronted his daughter. It was the best thing for their situation. \n\nSometimes, you have to bite the bullet and address things head on\u2026 especially if James can hear the comments.\n\nAnyway, I think it\u2019s good you set your boundaries regarding the wedding and even suggesting James take another date so he won\u2019t be alone.  Maybe this will be his push to tell his son to stop being rude. At the end of the day we are all human and deserve to be treated equally.", "Go for your BF. Not junior.", "NTA. As others have said, much of what\u2019s going on here likely has nothing to do with you personally. Based on the absolute nothing I know about James\u2019 family\u2026he and his ex-wife need to make amends to Junior, meaning they have to make a concerted effort to help him heal. It\u2019s the only way to create a path towards a real and healthy family dynamic. Once they have a solid relationship internally, maybe they can lay the groundwork for a good relationship btw you and Junior. \n\nIt sounds like they gave him a horrible childhood. Are there reasons for that? Sure, quite understandable and sympathetic ones. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that they have likely caused him years of heartache, and potentially serious emotional damage/trauma. That doesn\u2019t go away just because someone becomes an adult, and it certainly doesn\u2019t go away just because the parents evolve into stable, mature people *after* their kid has suffered a crap childhood. It may be salt in the wound for junior to see his father in a healthy relationship after subjecting him to living as a helpless child in a toxic marriage. Divorce almost always affects kids negatively, and this one doesnt seem like an exception. If James is the loving and wonderful person you say he is (and I don\u2019t doubt that, you seem very in love), he might want to turn some of that towards some heartfelt conversations with his son. \n\n\u2026if I was totally off the mark here, please feel free to ignore these comments from an internet stranger who lives in your phone \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\nI just think realistically, he is not going to be wasting time at his wedding making remarks at you and you would make it so James doesn't feel conflicted about the day.

You are not a replacement son, you are his partner of 2 years. It's not a father-son travel, it is a couple's travel. I think someone needs to remember him that you are having sex with his father, that you are a COUPLE. \n\nAnd yes, it is quite common in the LGBTQIAPN+ community that some people are attracted to older people, you are both adult men in different stages in life, but you are a couple and no one else's opinion or prejudice against a couple's age difference outside of the couple matters if you are both grown adults.", "Junior has already made his preferences known.

Ironically enough the NC came when I was 20, she 37, and the person in question was 19. The kid had a mommy complex and it got weirder cuz I found out he ran out of his mom\u2019s house due to some disagreement. He worked hard obviously but he had issues in the end and when he was hooking up with my mom he had a haircut from her\u2026. That part really weirded me out. \n\nOtherwise that weekend sucked so bad cuz we had a huge winter storm in freaking April and I got stuck with her guest. She kept insulting my relationship, degraded me, treated her guest like shit, and overall wasn\u2019t a parent. That\u2019s my backstory otherwise my mom always chased younger men ALWAYS i just knew it got worse as I got older.

He has since then set firm lines and defended me.\n\nTO BE FAIR: James own friends busted him a bit and said the same thing when I first started coming around (\"your new play thing,\" etc) - they were truly just busting their friend though, and have since become very supportive. I think though he (James) didn't understand the difference between his son making a jab VS his buddies (straight and gay) just joking around (in some cases, his gay friends - even making it a compliment). \n\nThe twisted irony is that the very thing Junior seems to fear - me separating him from his father, his father pulling financial support away from him, etc - is only starting to happen because of his opposition to our relationship - not the relationship itself.", "TY for your honest feedback.

Junior recently asked to be proven I hadn't been added to any kind of deeds, insurances, credit cards, bank accounts, etc - and of course - NO, I have zero \"power\" or anything like that. \n\nHowever, in that same conversation James - perhaps a bit too sternly out of feeling like he was being attacked - did make it clear that IF we did get married or even just move in together, I would be entitled to the same respect and \"standards\" that any partner would - man or woman.\n\nQuite frankly, and I'm just venting - Junior is a bit of a brat. It's definitely a weird dynamic given I am closer in age to the son than the father - but James and I are \"self-made\" - came from VERY modest backgrounds \n\nJunior however, thanks to his parents hard work, was born with 1000x more privilleges and open doors then I or James ever had in our youth.", "Thank you.

It doesn't matter, so let that bird fly away.\n\nJust introduce him as your partner. If people ask, just say, the only time we keep track of is how long we have been together.

He started dating you when you were in your twenties! That's a huge power imbalance of social status, finance, experience, and wisdom. Putting aside concerns over the predatory nature of age gap couples,  no matter how old his son gets, that will always be his dad and his emotions will run high and he will try to be protective of him, whilst also probably embarrassed and horrified his father is dating a much younger man.", "OP, you can\u2019t make his family accept you. You have to decide what boundaries you need (or not) to establish with James around his family to feel comfortable staying together. From you, I see a lot of what I see in other similar situations. Sometimes folks think that if they just explain things differently, use different words, communicate using a different approach, the issues will be resolved because suddenly everyone will understand how they feel. That\u2019s not always true. Sometimes, there\u2019s a fundamental chasm that can\u2019t be crossed. You need to set your boundaries, discuss them with James, and go from there.

You're also younger than the son, yes? Do you know what this reminds me a little of...just a little bit of that lady Anna Nicole Smith or even Crystal Harris, both married partners who are way more advanced in age. People would talk and side eye them, even assigned them names, i.e 'gold diggers' in addition to 'sugar babies,' etc.\n\nHonestly, if I were put in the son's position, I'd likely be disagreeable with my father's choice but I'd be staying away from the issue. But the difference is, my father is not as wealthy as your partner. Your partner's son has family wealth he may be thinking of so he's got more incentive to be more outspoken in his disagreement.\n\nIn the end, you have to just be you. If you think this is how life should be, and you're content/happy as is. You do you. But you probably shouldn't expect your partner's son to act lovely.

The man is TWICE your age. It's weird he's dating someone younger than his son. You were still in your 20's when you started dating. I'm a good decade + older than you,  and a good two or so decades younger than your boyfriend and I don't date people your age because I have almost nothing in common with that age range.\n\nSo that's something you need to consider in all this.

It sounds like you guys have a healthy relationship.

When you're gay, you have a WAY smaller dating pool than straight people do, even in large cities. \n\nSo how do we expand that pool? We let go of things that limit it, and a big one for that is age. After about 25 people's maturity generally stagnates (sans some pretty big changes), and there's not much reason to shut yourself off from dating with a big age gap.

Coming out is a HUGE change, and it's like going back to chapter 1 in a \"choose your own adventure\" book because you realized you made one wrong choice and it's the only way to get a different ending.
