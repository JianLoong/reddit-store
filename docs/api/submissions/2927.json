I'll also point out that the cashier, per their own words, could have voided the whole transaction and then just rang it up again.\n\nI had a similar upsetting incident, though not related to tipping.  I got into a 20-minute argument with the manager at my local Domino's because they substituted an item, without asking me, but then refused to return the cost of the original item to my credit card.  It was a delivery order.\n\nThey told me they could only reverse the whole charge.  Me, \"Great.  Then reverse the whole charge and ring it up again.  Minus the item you didn't deliver.\"  I was not rude to them at all, but they kept accusing me of trying to get my order for free when that was clearly not what I was asking for.  So you all make a mistake and then are going to compound it further by insulting me.  Wow.\n\nThen the manager sarcastically says something like, \"Then you'd be getting the garlic knots (the substitution) for free.\"  I told him he was more than welcome to come pick them back up, because I don't like them and wouldn't eat them anyway.  In the end, he reversed the charge for my whole order.  Maybe it would have screwed up their system to ring it back up again, though they didn't tell me that.  But then they should have a better system for when stuff like this happens.", "So what he didn\u2019t leave a tip?", "I would think corporate doesnt care if their workers gets tips or not. However, if I went through this exhange, I would rethink going to this store entirely so it can affect customers coming in and therefore the money they make.", "These all sound like examples of pile-ons where people who didn't use the service left bad reviews, or at least that's what an algorithm thought. I would think what happened in those three instances was that the Facebook algorithm determined that there was something unusual or unnatural about the reviews in question - which there was - and thought (rightly so) that these reviews are fake bullshit and so deleted them. Perhaps the report mechanism helped to flag these fake reviews to Facebook, but the algorithm decided that they were fake. \n\nIt is entirely possible and quite straightforward to simply remove the 'review' tab / function altogether though. The reviews still exist but it's hard for the public to see them.\n\nBut I think you're confusing the owner deleting bad reviews with the Facebook algorithm determining that certain people are abusing the review system and deleting their reviews."]}
