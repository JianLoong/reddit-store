I tried to press the number 4 for \"other\" but the button did not work. I told the worker number 4 did not work and asked the worker what to press for \"other\" and she told me 3. After I selected 3 it added a 30% tip to my card. I told her I wanted to select other and not 30%. She told me she was not aware that I was not trying to tip and she thought she remembered the number order. I asked her to refund my my tip and she said that's not possible since they can only refund actual orders if there is something wrong with the food. I told her the card reader buttons were not working properly and it does not have an easy or obvious option to select no nor did the right option work. \n\nShe refused to refund me saying \"it wasn't that much anyway\". I asked to speak to the manager telling the manager they need a more user friendly option to select no on the card reader and the manager told me all card readers are like this (it's not other places have a no option and touch screen). She told me my tip would really be appreciated and help her staff since the holidays are coming up and this could be my way to make someone's day. I told her that because they are using a system like this they don't care about their customers let alone their workers if they need to even rely on scamming people to get tips and I want a refund. The manager asked me why I selected a 30% option if I wanted other and I told her the number for other did not work and when I asked her worker about it she told me the wrong answer.
