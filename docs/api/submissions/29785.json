Whether or not you two are compatible doesn\u2019t come down to difference of opinion as much as \u201eam I willing to compromise on this and is my partner equally willing to compromise for me to make us work\u201c compromise, honest and open communication, and understanding are the cornerstones to a healthy lasting relationship and if you\u2019re serious about her then being able to compromise on something so largely important to her as religion should be fairly easy. \n\nFrom the sounds of it (the way I\u2019m interpreting your post) is that she\u2019s already agreed that any potential kids wouldn\u2019t be forced into religion inside your shared home but that at the grandparents house they\u2019d be expected to go in attendance if they\u2019re there on a Sunday. Which I mean.. it\u2019s really not that hard to avoid your kids doing weekend sleepovers if you wanted to. \n\nMy daughter had gone to church with my parents twice in her almost 2 years of life when they watched her during emergencies for us. She will be told when she\u2019s older that her attendance when she\u2019s at my parents on a Sunday is expected but that the decision to be religious is entirely her own and that if she feels bullied into the decision then she shouldn\u2019t make it.", "Okay, so I'm coming at you with empathy but also being realistic:\n\nNTA for saying that *you* would never force your kids to go to church but the issue is that, by your admission in the comments, your partner is very much still living under her parents' thumb. She is not yet an established adult who has healthy boundaries with them.\n\nThe idea of \"if they're under *my parents roof* they will follow my parents' rules\" is not inherently problematic but it does imply that she would be willing to have kids while still *staying with her parents*.\n\nNo bueno in my view.\n\nShe needs to be able to stand on her own two feet, as an adult, in her own home(whether on her own or with a partner) and while financially independent before she has kids.\n\nThe fact that you are willing to make some compromises, *if* it is about holidays, is sweet but the fact that her reaction was to completely shut down the conversation and stonewall you should have you reconsidering this relationship.\n\nShe is not mature enough to have kids anytime soon and I would not recommend having kids with someone who is so utterly unable to detach her parents' wants and views from her own life.\n\nGenuinely: I would recommend breaking up.", "YTA.  If grandparents are baby sitting on Sunday, the kids can go to church with them-just like they can go to the beach or swimming.

You'd insist they stop, or you'd keep your kids out of their home.\n\nIf you and your wife agreed that the kids should not go to their church, you would have every right to expect that mandate to be honored.\n\nThere are so so many posts on Reddit about spouses who let their parents run roughshod over their partners and kids.

If she won't stand up to them for the sake of a child, it might be best to back out sooner rather than later.", "NTA\n\nJust to be clear, for such a young relationship this sort of conversation is how one figures out if they're properly on the right page for marriage and children.

In elementary school, I used to spend a week every summer with my Catholic maternal grandparents, and they took me to church on the Sunday of that one week every summer. I *hated* it. I complained regularly to my mom that her parents were taking me to church and I wanted them to stop. She just shrugged and said that while I was under their roof, I had to follow their rules, and anyway, I was too young to be left home alone, so when they wanted to go to church, they didn't have much choice but to take me with them.\n\nThe thing is, being dragged to church for one day every summer didn't actually brainwash me. If anything, it probably just prevented me from becoming curious about what church was like, because I saw enough of it to not want to see any more of it.

While these may also come from encounters in life, the difference is that a message is embedded with an associated emotion, which solidly into a belief. \n\nFor example, I may say \u201cI value family.\u201d However, a belief mirroring this might be \u201cFamily is everything\u201d from hearing this repeatedly growing up in a close-knit family. \n\nExample value: fairness and equality. \n\nExample belief: The world is unfair and I\u2019m never treated like I should be. I demand that I be treated equal. \n\nValue: Financial stability.  \n\nBelief: Money doesn\u2019t grow on trees. I have to work hard to earn a living. There isn\u2019t enough to go around. \n\nNow, with this in mind, I\u2019m going to take it a step further when it comes to religious beliefs. \n\nBecause many of these come with lifestyle practices, connectedness with (supposedly) likeminded people, authority figures who we\u2019re discouraged from questioning as well as texts that are self-proclaimed to be from an all-knowing source, these beliefs become even more integrated as part of a person\u2019s identity.\n\nPeople, as a whole, do NOT act contrary to their identity. \n\nBeliefs inform thoughts, thoughts inform emotions and behaviors, behaviors reinforce identity, and identity solidifies pre-existing beliefs. \n\nSo, to expect someone to change their identity and beliefs (which they consider to be truth) is futile. Unless there is an event that causes their evidence to be shaken and faith in those beliefs questioned, they\u2019ll persist. \n\nI\u2019ve helped a number of people through issues of religious trauma and deconstruction of those beliefs, as well as identifying other negative beliefs  and replacing those with empowering ones. It\u2019s a difficult process, and one that only happens if the person wants it to.", "You're not compatible and won't actually have a say when the children actually come.

So if the adults in the home are going to church, so are the kids. Period. \n\nIf your hypothetical kids are spending the weekend at ages 2 or 3, and they decide at the last minute they don't want to go to church because it involves getting out of bed, and they don't want to,  do you expect your girlfriend's parents to drop everything and just stay home? What about at age 10? Old enough to think for themselves in this but too young to be legally left home alone. \n\nOr is it \"well, we'll just never have a weekend away and never leave the kids with them over a weekend, they'll just never stay with their grandparents if church is in the equation\" which is both a big sacrifice and going to seem like you're targeting them for their beliefs and going out of your way trying to keep your children from those beliefs. Most kids spend weekends at home most of the time, but almost all of them spend some weeks and weekends at a grandparent's house.\n\nExample: My aunt used to have her grandkids on weekends due to the work hours of her son, and she was going to church because she always went to church. Therefore, until the kids were old enough to be home alone, their decision to not go to church did not count. Because she could not (legally)  leave them home alone. When they were with their parents, they didn't go unless they asked ahead of time to \"go to church with mimi\" or whatever. She did not see this as forcing them (neither did the parents who are atheists, but this may be cultural for our area) \n\nNow that they are older, they go if they feel like going. My understanding is that sometimes they do, sometimes not, there's activities and people they enjoy there, so some of them do choose to go semi-regularly, some don't \n\nIf you choose to have kids with this woman, you are choosing that your children *will* be exposed to church. If they stay on a Sunday, until your kids are legally old enough to be left home alone, their decision not to go is a moot point. After that, you can have a boundary that if they say no, they can't be forced (and expect that to be a fight about rules in their home). But you can't really force your girlfriend's parents not to go to church, nor can you ask them to illegally leave small children home alone, so your only other option is the \"kids can never be there if going to church is an option\" compromise which your girlfriend will probably fight very hard against.  \n\nAnd that's just a small taste of the ways compromise won't really work in this situation, and what you can look forward to if you have kids with her, but if you can deal with stuff like that, the time to have the conversations is *now*", "Just don\u2019t have the kids spend the night and be there Sunday morning.

He's not in the sky", "Most churches and religious community groups have probably done more to aid in helping homeless or those down than you have lol", "https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122410386686\n\nhttps://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10943-016-0332-6\n\nThere is a well known and academically accepted correlation between religious activity and general happiness, as well as level of anxiety, economic outcome, and use of anti-depressant medication. This has been a studied phenomenon in psychiatry since at least the 1970s.", "Two commandments are all you need to follow\n\nLove and acknowledge God and love your neighbour and enemy as you love yourself\n\nExplain how that is evil\n\nEdit: explain how showing reverence for the source of all life is a terrible thing. Explain how loving the thing that birthed all life is evil", "The government created their laws, so by your logic, their evil for doing so", "Per a book written by people?", "Oh, I know those two, I read them awhile back on Quora.\n\n\nIt's not religion itself, its the sense of community that's the primary factor.\n\nA sense of community that could be acquired any number of ways that don't involve worshipping an invisible sky fairy\n\nOn a funnier note, I could see how \"Not believing in Magic\" would make for less happy people lol.", "I mean I got told that the antidepressant I was taking was why I was going to hell by the priest who baptized me, so that might be why religious people tend to not take them.", "Because if you choose not to, hes not so kind and loving anymore.\n\nIf you say \"No, I don't believe\" the response is eternal torture.\n\nYour faith boils down to \"Love me or I'll torture you\".", "Also, the book is a compilation of writings. The entire thing wasn't written by one or two people", "So because the hand that put pen to paper was human, that cannot mean that the words themselves are divinely inspired?\n\nWhat happens when the prophesies come true? What argument do you have then?", "Again, the philosophical aspects of religion are significantly more complicated than boiling something you don\u2019t understand down to \u201cinvisible sky fairy\u201d. The benefits of religious and spiritual activity extend beyond having a community of people that provide support. Again, it seems like you are more interested in deriding religion than attempting to understand religiosity in good faith, probably because it makes you feel intellectually superior without having to challenge your own beliefs.", "OK, so the government is evil for creating laws and expecting us to abide by them\n\nYou haven't actually answered my questions\n\nIf loving the source of all life and your neighbour and enemies as you love yourself, then the opposite of that is hating the source of all life and loving only yourself, which leads to treating those you don't like like shit\n\nWhich is the better of the two options? Which one would prevent interpersonal violence?\n\nSounds like you want to live a self centered life and your mad that there is consequences for that\n\nLet me put it this way.
