She\u2019s said \u201cif they\u2019re under my parents roof, they follow my parents rules\u201d which is fine to an extent. But I draw the line at forcing my kids to attend church. If my kids want to, that\u2019s one thing, I\u2019ll encourage it. But just like I wouldn\u2019t force them to show affection to family members or eat food they don\u2019t like (obviously after they try it) I won\u2019t force religion on them.

It's something that should be discussed and figured out BEFORE it becomes an actual problem and it's fine if it leads to a break up.\n\n\n\nThat being said, my husband is pretty anti-religion. I've stopped any belief in religion. My mom still goes to shul most Saturdays, more for social reasons. My brother has become super religious, but that's different. \n\n\nMy husband and I discussed whether or not we'd let my parents bring our future kids to services if they were watching them, and the eventual conclusion was \"yes\". We'd never go on our own, but if we need a babysitter on a Friday night/Saturday and that was the offer, we would take it.", "NTA\n\nAlso your justification of \u201cdisrespecting her parents wishes\u201d is ridiculous. Her parents aren\u2019t raising your theoretical child, they can have opinions but don\u2019t need to be actioned on. \n\nReligious folk love to indoctrinate children young, and forced church time is how they manage it. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want your children to be relig-bots, then don\u2019t impregnate a religious girl. \n \nIt seems simple enough how to avoid this outcome.", "Cheers, you have found a very clear dealbreaker for this relationship. Do not get kids with this woman, you now know very clearly what to expect If you do.", "NTA. Your kids should not be forced to go to hate group meetings.", "NTA. you needed to be clear on this sort of thing before you get more serious. If it's a deal breaker to either then its a deal breaker for both. It would cause catastrophic issues if unaddressed.", "Absolutely NAH. You are right to work out any religious differences before things get serious.\n\nReligion and personal values/beliefs, money, where to live, whether and how often to travel, and how many kids you want - those are the things that can make a marriage not work even if you both try your best. There simply is no way for two people who don't want the same thing to be happy married to someone who doesn't want what they want.\n\nShe doesn't like it because she knows she will probably have to break up with you, if the issue is important to her. But you are absolutely right to be honest, and neither one of you is wrong for wanting what you want.", "Don't have children with this woman, and don't do it under her parent's roof.  NAH, as I think this a point of compatibility.", "NAH. You're not religious, she is. It's best you sort this kind of thing out before you have kids. You may not be able to compromise on this one though.", "NAH; however it doesn\u2019t seem like your girlfriend is actually religious otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be with you. No hate on you; a religious marrying a non religious person is usually a no. \nThese hypothetical children should be going to church if they are in their grandparents care, not even for religions sake but for the minor\u2019s safety.", "NTA and you should maybe reconsider dating someone who wants to force their religion on their kids if you don't want to.", "NTA, you are not compatible enough to have children together, check to see if this came up because she's already pregnant, and break up.", "NTA, hypothetically, make sure the kids aren't at her parents' house on Sundays and avoid having an issue.", "NTA  You need to end this before you have kids with this person. There's no compromise possible!", "Well frankly I'll say this, I suggest you both go find other mates. Your girlfriend wants to follow the parents church if you don't agree with it,  in time that is going to cause a rift where you end up divorcing anyway.", "RUN", "If you don't want your (hypothetical) kids to go to church with your parents-in-law, don't ask your parents-in-law to watch them on Sunday mornings. \n\nYour parents-in-law will be in church on Sunday morning. Your choice is whether or not your kids are with them.\n\nYTA, because you seem to be assuming some sort of right to have your parents watch your kids.", "NTA, but you two are absolutely not compatible. This may be the first time religion has come between you, but it certainly won\u2019t be the last - especially if you plan to have kids. Have you talked about whether your kids will be baptized? Surely she\u2019ll want to get married in a church- make sure you read the service her minister/priest plans to perform if you choose to get married! Honestly religion is one of those things that will likely repeatedly come up and be a problem as your relationship progresses.", "nta, dont marry or have kids with this woman. she already wants to control them and stomp over their boundaries and they dont even exist yet. certified bruh moment.", "ESH. She too is a parent to these hypothetical children, so you both need to reach an agreement on the situation because both of you have the right and say in it.", "NTA. She's being a bit of TA for not speaking with you. Otherwise this is N-A-H. Different people have different views on this stuff. You'll either have to find an acceptable compromise/solution or break up over it.", "NTA\n\nAnd its very wise to have this discussion now.\n\nAnd if her parents wish to have a relationship with yoir hypothetical future kids, its YOUR rules they have to accept. And if you and GF tell them that they have to accept no church for the kids if they wish to babysit, well then thats how it has to be.", "NTA but you guys aren\u2019t compatible", "NTA. First, this will probably cause problems down the road. If she's not even willing to talk to you about it, actually raising kids might end your relationship. Second, even as a Christian, I would probably only force my kids to go to church (giving them something else to do like read or color) until they were 9/10 after that they can stay home if they want since they'll be old enough. Being forced to go to church is useless, I didn't learn anything from it because I was zoned out the whole time and bored out of my mind.", "NTA. Time to move on, she\u2019ll never have your back when it comes to her family", "NTA. Y\u2019all seem to have reached a values impasse in your relationship though. This sounds like a deal breaker on both of your ends.", "NTA but you would be an asshole to marry this person. This is a huge issue.", "YTA.  As parents, you do not have the sole authority to undermine the other parent like that.  If this is such a sticking point, it is best to break up now.", "NTA  but keep in mind.... You can't force her parents to miss church because they have your kids either. \n\nIn the future I would plan on having the kids picked up before church on Sundays or dropped off the night before. Don't leave em with the grandparents on a church day.", "NTA.\n\nI harbor great resentment towards my parents for forcing me to go to church when I was a child. I resisted every step of the way.\n\nIt\u2019s literally indoctrination.", "NTA. You're still relatively young, and you may find that your conflicting beliefs become more of an issue over time. Especially if you have kids. \n\nEdit: clarity", "Ask her how she'd feel about you signing them up to the Satanic Temple", "Stupidest thread in the history of the sub\n\n\nI say send the imaginary little shits to a nunnery", "YTA for telling you how it is gonna be with your kids. That's a decision to be made mutually. \n\nIs there anything else about raising your kids that you are deciding that you girlfriend won't have a say in? \n\nThis seems like a deal breaker in the relationship.", "YTA\n\nPart of the social contract of having your in-laws watch the kids is that they will go to church on Sunday. You don't get to force your in-laws to stay home from church to watch your kids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But unfortunately this is the kind of thing where if you\u2019re really serious about each other and you both actually do want kids one day, you should figure out now if it\u2019s something either (or both) of you are actually willing and able to compromise on without becoming resentful or if it\u2019s a big enough deal breaker that this relationship just isn\u2019t going to work out. \n\nAnd there no shame if it turns out that this is a hard line for one/both of you and you decide to end things. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have these conversations when the kids are still hypothetical. It doesn\u2019t mean that either of you is wrong or thinks the other one is wrong, just that your expectations for how your future family will work aren\u2019t compatible. If you can find a compromise that you\u2019re both *actually* happy with, that\u2019s awesome, but if not, it\u2019s probably better to end things now. \n\nI considered N T A bc you said she\u2019s ignoring you which isn\u2019t great but given she\u2019s 21 this might be the first time she\u2019s had one of these big-topic talks  or had one go badly and it can really suck to realize it might not work out with someone you really like because of something that isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault. So I\u2019m gonna give her a break.", "No of course you're NAH for that being a boundary you don't want crossed. This seems like it would be an issue if you had kids with her, among other disagreements about what's best for the kids. It's very difficult to coparent with somebody whose worldview and values don't align with yours, since you would both technically have full control over the kids. Definitely reconsider a future with her if you both intend on having children. (She didn't do anything wrong either, its just a disagreement over what hypothetical children will be exposed to).", "Don\u2019t get married", "NTA - and you should think more closely about the logic of your kids only following her parents rules when they're watching them. That could very quickly cause problems either with the parents enforcing something that you aren't in favor of or vice versa, them not enforcing rules that you have and potentially punishments you have given when they go to their grandparents.", "Nta but you guys are seriously incompatible. Do not have a family with someone whose values and respect for boundaries differ so much from your own. Its not that interfaith relationships cant work, but you have to be on the same page which the two of you arent", "How about this.  Don't ask her Parents to watch them on a day, or night they attend church.", "nta. the fact that she doesnt like church either but is going to make her kids go to appease her parents is the weirdest part for me. unhealthy lack of agency/boundaries", "NAH. You have different values and shouldn\u2019t raise children together", "NTA.\n\nIs this how you want to spend the next 20 years? Trying to protect your children from half-baked religious decrees? \n\nBro \ud83d\ude2b", "NTA but you two are too young to be thinking about having kids. The fact you each have very opposite views on a major issue in marriage., ie. religion, is a big red flag if you plan on getting married.", "NTA. But be thankful this came about from hypotheticals and not an actual pregnancy. It looks like you guys will have to do some soul searching to see if you are compatible long term (because it sounds like you might not be)", "Back it up a bit...if they're under her parents' roof???  Why would they be and if they were, that would suggest you're not old enough or mature enough to have had kids in the first place.", "NTA. I used to have conversations like this too when I was your age. I used to think I could make it work with a partner that had vastly different values from my own as well. I was wrong. Ask her what she and/or her parents will do when one of your hypothetical children turns out to be gay. I asked that question. And that\u2019s how I realized we had NO future together.", "That\u2019s what i wanted to compromise with or like Christian holidays like Easter or Christmas service. I told her I would be willing to let it happen but the kids get told that they don\u2019t have to believe it if they choose not to. I have no problem with if they choose it. I want to raise my kids to be individual thinkers and believe what they want.", "To be fair, it takes a lot more than forced church time to do it, or I'd be a nutty Catholic right now.\n\nMom tried\\*, but the literal second I had full control of my Sunday mornings, I never willingly set foot in a church again.  I was never anything but bored, even before I realized how strongly I disagreed with a lot of the message.\n\nGoing to church once in a while with grandma and grandpa is not going to turn the kids into Jesus freaks, they're probably just going to be bored.  OP is absolutely, 100%, NTA, and I think he's very much right to stand his ground for exactly the reason you said- they're his (hypothetical) kids- but I think the danger of them actually picking up the nonsense is low.  \n\\*I should clarify that my mom is a wonderful, intelligent, and not at all brainwashed woman.  She's got as healthy a relationship as one can get with the Catholic Church.  Which may be part of the reason it turns out she raised 3 atheists, but I feel like my point stands lol.", "Thing is though, she isn\u2019t as religious as her parents. She hates it too but her parents force her too", "Agreed it\u2019s my choice but my girlfriend\u2019s parents are god tier guilt trippers and they\u2019d throw a fit that they never get to see their grandkids. For additional context, her mom was upset that I never reached out to talk to her although she never did either. And every conversation ends up religious with her mom", "A values impasse, yes, but perhaps the biggest issue is that OP\u2019s GF won\u2019t speak to him because of the disagreement. It\u2019s one thing to find an area of values misalignment in a relationship, it\u2019s much more of a dealbreaker when one partner stonewalls to get their way rather than being willing to work toward reasonable solutions and compromises. Until OP\u2019s gf learns that skill, she doesn\u2019t seem mature enough to be a partner or parent.", "Please seek help", "You can\u2019t compromise with religious nuts. \n\nThey believe the have God on their side.", "Religion is not really something you can compromise on in terms of kids. If they really believe they think that not rising them Christian, going to church, etc. is damning them to hell. Nobody wants that for their children. If there is such a huge difference in beliefs you are probably not compatible in the long run. It's better to state each other's expectations sooner than later and if they are a deal breaker then move on.", "She\u2019s an adult no?", "Definitely agree! Stonewalling AP to get her way for a hypothetical is a cause for concern. Like would she change her feelings regarding OPs faith were they to get married? \n\nI feel like OP should also be able to tell from how her family is and how she was raised, that she would most likely have strong feelings on this issue. \n\nA Possible negotiation point would be when the kids are like 11 or 12 and have more wherewithal they will be able to make a decision concerning what they would like todo in regards to religious faith or church attendance.\n\n(Not really too religious myself but my partner is so I would expect her to probably have strong feelings regarding future stuff like that if we do decide to have a kid(s).)", "Yes but still lives at home and hasn\u2019t established adult boundaries with her parents", "And yet y\u2019all are worried about your own hypothetical kids together. This is a red flag.", "That's an enmeshed family. She may end up always being loyal to the family unit unless she gets some serious insight (and a spine). \n\nAn enmeshed family tends to have imbalance of power and everyone must act/believe the same way. Independent thinking is not allowed. You might research this on your own and decide if you want to get involved with it."]}
