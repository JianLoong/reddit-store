The debt is not extreme and we expect to fully pay it by the end of this year. We keep a pretty much comfortable lifestyle but we have to manage our finances more wisely.\n\nYesterday, my husband tripped over a power cord and knocked a glass of water over his gaming laptop. It is dead now and the cost of repair will be ridiculous. \n\nHusband wants to buy a new laptop right now. I reminded we are currently limiting all luxury expenses and I believe a new laptop just for games counts as one. He doesn't have any other computer related hobbies, just games. He has a separate work laptop provided by his company. He could browse most of the internet from his phone and even if he wants to do something desktop specific he could use my small laptop I use like once a week. It won't be able to handle any games though.\n\nSo I listed all of the above to him but he's saying I want to make him miserable for a year for no reason. He also said that I'm being salty because most of *my* shopping expenses are cut now (jewelry, handbags, etc). I said, isn't that, like, the entire point of saving money? I don't buy extra shit, you don't buy it either. But he insists he *can't* live without laptop and I *can* live without a new handbag. Like having a laptop is as important to him as having a phone. Yeah I would consider buying a new phone an emergency in case the old one is lost or broken, but NOT a new hot flagship phone for all the money in the world. Just a decent one.\n\nThis whole thing feels unfair to me but he says I'm the one being selfish and spiteful.\n\nAnd just to be clear I don't control his finances so technically he could go and buy the laptop. It would not throw us into poverty and I would not like file for divorce over it. But I would be very veeeerryyy mad. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank y'all for your perspective. I guess the cost of that unexpected expense sent me into a panic mode and blinded me a bit. Hubs is asleep, I'll talk to him in the morning. I think we could buy a new laptop with 2 conditions:\n\n1. Better cable management\n2.

So, i think he figured it out quite quick its easier and cheaper to buy a new one\n\nBut if you repair laptops pls tell us how would you go about it. Since you can suggest duch a thing you must know about the subject", "The conversation never got that far because instead of compromise, OP shut it down.", "Aye. That's understandable.\nBut he isn't the only one in their marriage having to make sacrifices.", "Why are you defensive about this? Are you OPs husband or something? It was a question\u2026. They said the cost to have it repaired was too high (implying it could be repaired). I was asking why he doesn\u2019t do the repair himself. There was no info about what made the cost of repair too high (parts vs labor) so it was a fair question. The answer very well could be \u201cthe parts alone are more than a new laptop.\u201d But he didn\u2019t drop the thing in the ocean\u2026 it was a glass of water. How much water? What got damaged? There are variables here and I asked a question as a suggestion and you show up to\u2026. What exactly is the point of your responses?", "Would neve rbe ops husband, i have 2 brain cells that tell me not to leave any liquid near electronic devices, its a pretty nice common sense, prevents accidents of all types.\n\nYes, all electronic devices can be repaired, but in many cases such ad laptops and phones , buying a new one has the same or even lower price than fixing it, hence i asked if you know what you are talking sbout or just guessing \" how expensive can a fix be\".\n\nWater gets into electronic components quite easily. Just putting it in rice doesnt fix it. Not exucusing the guy from being clumsy.\n\nAlso, most people CANT repair those things. If you break your phone screen, you COULD repair it, but if everyone had the know how on how to do it then there wouldnt be repair shops everywhere that fix cracked screens on phones. Same goes for laptops.\n\nThe cost is high because its a laptop. Opening those up and checking for what csn be causing an.issue has a lot of handiwork, and getting the parts that need replaced ( if not a whole motherboard ) makes prices high. I just showed up to answer a very well uniformed suggestion you did. And even asked if you know how to fix a laptop, since if you do you wouldnt say \" just fix it\"", "Hey,\nI'm in IT for 15 years, own an IT company for 10 years.  \n\nMost people can't repair things because they don't try.  The correct screwdriver and a spudger and all things come open.  Remove the battery and let the unit dry for a good long while and then see where you are.  \n\nYou're talking about some worst case scenario stuff.  \n\nRarely is it a worst case scenario.", "I wasn\u2019t guessing at anything. I asked a fucking question and you jumped down my throat about it. \n\nI have repaired plenty of electronics, including computers. Yeah sometimes it\u2019s totally not worth it. Things like water damage can cause that, depending on how much water, if it was on or off, and what was done right afterwards to mitigate the situation. None of those details were provided. *Which is why I asked*. \n\nI\u2019m also a firm believer that you can learn to do anything. And mostly, I do. For example: 10 years ago I started doing my own brakes from YouTube videos and manuals available on the internet. You can learn anything by reading and watching. And OP\u2019s husband can too. The question was really \u201cis it worth it for this?\u201d.", "Spoke from experience, had to help 2 friends and \n- one burnt the motherboard and had to have it taken to replace \n- another one damaged the gpu on it and decided to get a new one\nOn both cases the repairs were expensive ( didnt charge them anything ) , but the one with water was the worst. A store suggested taking it apart and doing what you mentioned as soon as the water spill occurred, but it was a week late and the famage was done.\n\nIve been told to submerge the components in isoprophyl alchohol to make the water leave the components, but i dont have that much isoprophyl alchohol nor the guts to try it", "I have more experience than you do. \n\nEven if the motherboard is shot, it isn't more than a new gaming laptop.  Especially if you buy one used.", "A motherboard can absolutely be replaced, and that doesn\u2019t need to be taken in. People can do that replacement on their own, and there are affordable options. I\u2019ve replaced motherboards often. Again, anyone can learn to do anything.", "The gaming laptop was 600$, a 2017 nitro one. Not all gaming laptops are thousands of $$$\n\nAccident happened in 2019, so yeah, 100% was more expensive than getting a new  one.\n\nBuying one used would be the same as buying a replacement tho? \n\nGlad you have more experience, you can tell me if the isoprophyl trick is worth giving a shot in case of a massive spill of water as i never tried it", "We should have ops husband to post the damages and what needs fixing, im talking assuming he went to mtiple stores to ask, not just the first mayor retail shop that offers \" solutions\" for absurd prices"]}
