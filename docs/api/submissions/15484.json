If she\u2019s in a \u2018time of need\u2019 she shouldn\u2019t be going to Europe, period. She\u2019s trying to guilt and mooch off you.", "NTA. Your friend just wants a free trip.", "NTA.\n\n\"Friends\" like this rarely have actual \"times of needs\" because they are so used to taking advantage of other people (often in their time of need). Her anger and calling you the selfish one is part of the gimmick to trick you into falling for it. It's no coincidence that she found someone who is gonna feel guilty for saying no.", "NTA\u2026my parents taught me you only lend what you can afford to not get back. If Jane is struggling financially she shouldn\u2019t be going go Europe.  Don\u2019t feel guilty for not being willing to put yourself in an adverse financial situation to help Jane, who I feel won\u2019t pay you back.", "NTA her expenses aren\u2019t your problem. You saved up and she should\u2019ve done the same", "NTA. She knew what the trip cost and didn't make any attempt to meet that amount. Now she's asking you to front the money. If you do you'll never get paid back. She might make small payments but in the end you'll ask her for the repayment, she'll throw a fit that you care more about money than her, and she'll use that as the reason she can no longer be your friend.", "NTA - \n\nThis is not a \"time of ***NEED***\" for her...if she thinks this she is sadly mistaken and does not understand what \"NEED\" is.  A European vacation is a **luxury, NOT** a \"need\". \n\nI'm still just amazed she used in her \"time of need\".  Ridiculous! Her time of need if she has no money for food, or she's short on rent and is going to be homeless.  NOT a damn vacation. \n\nYou will be the \"bad guy\" and this (one sided) friendship may end no matter what you do. If you don't give her the money - and even if you do.  Because the chances of her actually paying you back are slim at best.  She wants to go, but didn't save or budget for it.  When uyou get back she won't ever have 'enough' money to be able to pay you back - then will guilt you every time you ask if she's going to pay you, then she eventually cut you off or you will get sick of her being a mooch.\n\nThink back on your friendship - I don't know how long you've  been friends, but how many times have you picked up the check, brought stuff to share and she never reciprocates? I'm betting she's been a 'taker' for a long time. \n\nIf you do give her the money, make sure you can afford to lose it and if you REALLY want her  to go and you're willing to pay for her then I would make a loan agreement document so you have the amount and details in writing - and if possible get something of value from her as collateral in addition to the loan document.   You're going to be pissed during the trip when she will miraculously have money for items she wants to buy or for things she wants to do.  But will expect you to cover hotel, food, tips etc. \n\nI strongly suggest you NOT give her the money.", "NTA. Never \u201cloan\u201d money you can\u2019t afford to lose. You did the smart thing. Jane is the bad friend here trying to guilt you into covering all the costs that she most likely wouldn\u2019t have ever paid back.", "Let me get this straight. You and your friend made plans to go to Europe, both agreed on splitting the costs, friend tells you last minute she doesn't have the money and asks for you to loan it and then gets angry at you when you say no?? If anything she is ruining your friendship. You are NTA.", "NTA\n\nHer financial commitments are her responsibility.", "NTA - can\u2019t be nice with money you don\u2019t have. You saved and she should have done the same.", "NTA. If she couldn't save the money she knew she needed for months, there's very little chance she'd pay you back.", "NTA. As the sun shall rise tomorrow, she will not repay one dime of that money and your friendship will end, so let her be mad and save yourself the heartache of losing her and being a sucker.", "NTA - Do not loan her the money, you will never get it back. And if you do loan it to her, you will have to pay for a lot of/everything on the trip too, it won't just end at the big stuff.", "Helping a friend in a time of need is buying them groceries.  It isn't buying them a trip to Europe. \n\nShe won't ever pay you back.  She'll always be in need and if you do this,  her expectations will only increase.", "NTA- loaning money to a friend is sticky. It was okay for her to ask, but for her to call you selfish and tell you that you're not being a good friend is manipulative.", "NTA.  If you can\u2019t afford it then you can\u2019t and she needs to get over it.", "NTA. Jane is being very manipulative.", "NTA Don\u2019t. I can\u2019t tell You how many Redditors never got that money after the trip. If you can\u2019t afford it, you don\u2019t go on vacation.", "NTA, a person like this is NOT worth your friendship. She\u2019s the one being selfish and not being a true friend, instead financially burdening you. You should drop her like a hot potato before she asks more from you.", "NTA \n\nTravel isn't a need. It's a want. It's something you save up for before you go. If she couldn't put money aside for it during the planning process then why should you believe that she will be willing or able to put money aside to pay you back when there is nothing to lose but your friendship? \n\nIf she is having genuine financial difficulties then staying home and sorting those out are the best option for her.\n\nI hope you are still able to go on the trip alone. Go have fun meet new people and don't worry about Jane. Her lack of savings isn't your problem to solve.", "Absolutely NTA Jane is not asking you to pay for dinner for her this is a trip to Europe. I\u2019m gathering you\u2019re in the US, so this bill will likely run into $$$$\u2019s. If you still really want to go to Europe as a solo traveller there will be thousands of people in the same boat you could arrange to meet up with or do it alone. You didn\u2019t state what cities you\u2019ll be visiting but Europe in general is a pretty safe place.", "NTA The fact that she's mad at you says a lot about who she is.  Now you know.", "Do not pay. She won't pay you back.\n\nI would suggest she is the selfish friend for agreeing to all these plans with you and agreeing to pay while not making any effort to save OR by being too optimistic about what she could afford. Then she lays the guilt on when the reality is you have done nothing wrong. NTA", "NTA, she is the one changing the original agreement.

You are not to blame for your he financial problems.", "NTA to echo what a bunch of people have already said a trip to Europe is a luxury, not a need. You said no, she got mad, she is the one who is not being a good friend. I agree with everyone who says that if you covered her expenses you would probably not have seen very much of that money back. Because, you know, good friends don\u2019t let money stand between them and good friends don\u2019t hound each other for money and I would just bet she\u2019s got a list of things that good friends do or don\u2019t do that are all for her benefit.", "NTA\n\nJanes lack of planning is not your responsibility", "NTA don\u2019t do it you will never see a dime of your money back..

Or is Jane part of your open marriage?", "NTA\n\nShe has had the same amount of time to plan and save. \n\nYou will never see that money again. Her negative reaction tells you this.", "Jane is the selfish one and bad friend, you would never see that money back either.", "NTA. Never put yourself in a tough spot financially to lend money to someone else. You aren\u2019t selfish at all. \n\nShe knew this trip was happening, she should\u2019ve saved up like you did.", "NTA. \n\nShe knew she couldn\u2019t afford it a long time ago but didn\u2019t say anything hoping you\u2019d \u201cbe a good friend\u201d and pay for her when she conveniently let you know last minute.", "Nta.

Cheaper hotels? Picnics instead of restaurants?", "NTA. I would be hesitant to help her as well.", "This. If she pay now she is going to pay for all the expence during the trip. She s a friend not her child. \nNTA", "no she wants me to pay for it all"]}
