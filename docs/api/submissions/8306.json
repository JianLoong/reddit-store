We work in similar fields, so there could potentially be some overlap in our day-to-day work as well. Since we\u2019re living together, I feel like it\u2019d be unhealthy for our relationship to spend so much time together as we\u2019d be with each other both at home and at work, have all the same work friends, and hardly spend any time apart from each other. \n\nHe was not very receptive to my concerns about this at all and told me I was being selfish, a rude person, and that I \u201cdidn\u2019t give a shit\u201d about him.

I k ow a couple that went into real estate together and divorced within two years because they were with each other 24/7. \n\nWhat I\u2019m concerned about are the words your boyfriend used. He said you were selfish, rude, and didn\u2019t give a shit about him when you were actually the opposite: you were looking out for the relationship for both of your sakes. If I were you, I might really think about his motives for wanting to do this. By being around you all the time he can also monitor what you\u2019re doing all of the time. Plus, calling you rude and selfish was an AH thing to do. IMHO, this guy only cares about himself", "NTA, that's a smart and healthy boundary. Very few people can separate work and personal life and he definitely sounds like a person who can't.

His response is childish and disrespectful.", "Definitely NTA. It sounds like your boyfriend is not respecting a boundary you have pretty clearly and politely expressed to him. It is not your responsibility to help get him a job when he sounds very capable of getting a job all on his own, like most adults do. \n\nI would consider his response to your concerns a red flag for your relationship. Caring partners listen to each other and don\u2019t try to manipulate them when they don\u2019t get the outcome they want. The name-calling and specifically him saying that you \u201cdidn\u2019t give a shit\u201d about him made me cringe pretty hard to a previous unhealthy relationship of my own.

Of course, that implies respect for personal space and time from everyone involved. If that respect is one-sided, then it might not work.\n\nWorking together is a different story though. Hiring friends, family members and etc. is always a risk. They could treat you differently, could expect you to treat them differently and etc. In my experience, there was no problem introducing and hiring a friend is when I met that friend at previous job and we actually worked together for some time and thus I had very high confidence that everything would work well.

I don't know if this is possible for you though. One couple I know met at work as seatmates.

I doubt that OP's partner would be happy with a job in another department where he never gets to see OP.\n\n In order for him to be ready to work with her, he would have to recognise all the things people have mentioned here.

Never mix domestic and a business setting. What is more concerning is how readily he is to bully you, loads of berating, emotional blackmail and anger and calling you selfish etc. Next time he wants something he will brow beat you into submission. A job was going at my husband's company and I said that sounds interesting. We sat down like grown ups and discussed the pros and cons. In the end we agreed best not. There was no anger, berating, accusations, emotional blackmail. If I'd tried it, i'm sure I'd of got the job, the thing is , I've way too much respect for my husband personally, plus all the logical points he made were quite right. Your bf doesn't respect you, or your logic. He wants to use you to get what he wants.", "NTA. Not at all.

Him immediately insulting you though is a massive red flag and I would be having a talk with him on why he thinks it's appropriate to speak to you like that just because he's not getting what he wants and why is he so quick to dismiss your needs for his comfort.

There\u2019s not a day that goes by that we\u2019re not laughing our asses off and just thoroughly enjoying each others company. \n\nHaving said all this, I DO realize that our relationship is very unique and not ordinary. If you would\u2019ve told me 7 years ago that I was going to meet my soulmate and we\u2019d end up working together in construction side by side I would\u2019ve laughed in your face. It doesn\u2019t work for everyone. \n\nI totally understand why other people wouldn\u2019t want to take the risks that come with working together. OP, you are NTA. I hope all goes well for both you and your boyfriend!", "I think he is afraid to start post school work on his own. By working with you, he believes you will cover for him if he is uncertain or screws up.  Your independence and competence in getting your job, accepting a transfer while he was still in school, and managing all the details has him convinced you are a good shield for his insecurities.  \n\nOne downside to him working and living with you all at   once is any relationship issues that come up reduce your ability to walk away. You two will be tied together so totally that getting time away from each other would present problems in your workplace and living arrangements.\n\nThis is a transition period for each of you; he has a job lined up; he should be happy to just launch his working life and be happy to see how it all shakes out.", "Why is wanting to work from home a red flag?", "This. NTA. But, going forward, I would check your company policies. They usually have rules in place about people dating in the same departments, and then I'd just tell him it's not allowed.\n\nAlso, be REALLY sure you guys want to move in together. You've been dating for 3 years, but it sounds like you haven't been in the same area for most of it. If he's going to be making good money too, it MIGHT be worth him living in a separate place while your two date again.", "I'm retired (since before Covid) and my former employer had a generous WFH policy with approval of supervisor. But that would never have been open to a brand new employee - especially one who was just graduating from college. OP has demonstrated his ability to work remotely (by doing it full time for two years) so it isn't surprising that he was offered a hybrid position. \n\nWe did have some married co-workers who both worked for the company but they were in different divisions with maybe 3rd or 4th level managers in common. No way would I want my SO working that closely with me. It is the same logic about not starting a relationship with a co-worker.", "I think they're saying that the bf wanting OP to risk his reputation for a matter of preference in working style when he already has what seems like a great job lined up is the red flag, not the preference in hybrid work itself", ">To be fair I would consider that a red flag for an employer if they try to interfere with my relationship.\n\nThat the employer wants to know if two employees are sleeping together so they can be aware and balance roles? WTH?! that's an extremely common requirement and for **very** good reason. SO's working together can be fine but most of the time it can go sideways ***bad****.* That is something that can have a huge effect on a business. Usually SO's are on separate teams and you have to make sure they aren't in the same line of command or there will be issues whether from the couple or those outside of it. A lot of it depends on the exact job and position.\n\nNTA OP, and unless the whole company is guaranteed hybrid doesn't mean they would offer him hybrid just because you have it. Most business owners ***hate*** the lack of control WFH presents to them. TBF there are reasons for employers to hate it, those reasons generally have names and don't deserve to have jobs in the first place. Nothing like a few selfish bad apples that spoil everything for everyone.", "It's pretty common for an employer to want to know. If they don't and a case comes up that an employee is getting special treatment because they are in a relationship, then they are vulnerable to grievances raised by other staff. Or if they break up, then how does that expose them to cases around revenge or claims of sexual coercion? \nThere are ways round it - when someone I know was dating her senior manager, the company made sure all her appraisals etc were done by his boss.\n\nAs to working with someone who's sharing a home office let alone at same company, that's hard. It's good to get distance even from the closest relationship and I could see this ending up with him (sorry) working in the office more. Then at same company, same office, same field - they may be in competition for bonuses, promotions etc. I could see it causing issues.\nSo NTA", "I get the reputation risk, which I wouldn't do either but wanting to prioritize a hybrid schedule perk is not a red flag, especially depending on the commute.\n\na great job turns into a not so great job if you are stuck commuting 2-3 hours a day there and back", "I would reconsider any relationship in which my partner immediately resorts to name calling the minute I say no to something. \nNTA", "NTA your concerns are reasonable", "NTA - very wise and thoughtful position, imho.  Perhaps check with your employee (or handbook?) to see if your company even allows partners to work together?  There is such as a thing as TOO much togetherness.  And his attitude is definitely a red flag.  Adults have a conversation...", "Considering his response to your concerns, you see how those concerns. Those are very valid concerns and if y'all are working together with that overlap very likely either your work life is going to suffer or your home life is going to suffer.", "NTA\n\nWorking together as a couple rarely works, unfortunately. So I'd suggest talking with him again and just calmy explaining that you are looking out for the relationships best interest. It has nothing to do with him as a person, and it doesn't mean that you don't want to spend time with him. But relationships are supposed to enhance your life, not be your whole life.", "As someone who has worked for independent employers, and also in our family business, with husband ... \n\nDon't do it.\n\nNTA\n\nIt's hard as hell to be in a relationship and share work. It puts a strain EVERYWHERE that is virtually inescapable.  Laying in bed, at night, pissed off, next to the person who forgot to return an important phone call that day ... it strains a healthy sex life.  Cordially working beside your partner, in front of clients, when you're mad that he didn't cut the lawn, at home, like he promised 3 days ago ... makes being professional very difficult.\n\nYeah. We made it more or less work for us, eventually, but the strain was always there. And cross over happens, no matter how much you resolve not to let it.  You can pledge boundaries until you go purple. The reality is that the two lives will overlap and that strains BOTH environments.  Some can do it, and they're honestly happy. Personally, I've never met this unicorn couple.", "NTA\n\nWhile some couples can work together this doesn't mean all and both have to be comfortable to do so.\n\nThere is always a risk that home conflicts spill into work and visa versa or maybe people just need space. Ultimately you should not be pressured into this.", "NTA", "NTA. You are just trying to establish healthy boundaries. Arn are well within reason.", "NTA. I made the mistake of getting my boyfriend a job at the company I worked. We were in different departments but still saw each other throughout the day plus we lived together. He ended up getting in an argument with one of the managers and was fired during his probation period. I was completely embarrassed for putting a good word in for him just for him to mouth off and get fired.", "[removed]"]}
