We are currently long distance as I moved from our home state to a new city for a job (I\u2019ve had this job for two years but was just required to move this past April). My boyfriend has been planning to move in with me once he graduates and already has a job lined up with a good company making a great starting salary (more than I make now, actually). \n\nRecently, he\u2019s expressed to me that he might not want this job anymore. His would be fully in person whereas I work hybrid, going into the office 2-3 days per week, which he would prefer. He asked me if I could try to get him a job at my company. I expressed to him that while I\u2019m happy to connect him with someone to learn more about what he\u2019d like to do, I felt like it would be crossing a boundary in our relationship to work at the same company and out of the same office. We work in similar fields, so there could potentially be some overlap in our day-to-day work as well. Since we\u2019re living together, I feel like it\u2019d be unhealthy for our relationship to spend so much time together as we\u2019d be with each other both at home and at work, have all the same work friends, and hardly spend any time apart from each other. \n\nHe was not very receptive to my concerns about this at all and told me I was being selfish, a rude person, and that I \u201cdidn\u2019t give a shit\u201d about him. I\u2019ve tried to help get my friends jobs at my company in the past (although they did not get hired), and he asked me why I was willing to do it for other people and not him. The answer simply being that I don\u2019t live with these people, nor would they work in the same field or even live in the same city that I do. \n\nSo, AITA for this? Is it wrong for me to want this boundary in our relationship? Or is it wrong for me to not help my boyfriend get a job?", "created_utc": 1674717116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lm5dj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_a_boyfriend_a_job_at/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's see how that goes for him. Do NOT put your name/reputation on the line for this guy because he wants to work from home a few days a week. That's red flag pinball\n\nConsider having him get his own place as well. Find one with a 6 month lease and go from there.", "NTA. I k ow a couple that went into real estate together and divorced within two years because they were with each other 24/7. \n\nWhat I\u2019m concerned about are the words your boyfriend used. He said you were selfish, rude, and didn\u2019t give a shit about him when you were actually the opposite: you were looking out for the relationship for both of your sakes. If I were you, I might really think about his motives for wanting to do this. By being around you all the time he can also monitor what you\u2019re doing all of the time. Plus, calling you rude and selfish was an AH thing to do. IMHO, this guy only cares about himself", "NTA, that's a smart and healthy boundary. Very few people can separate work and personal life and he definitely sounds like a person who can't. First time you disagree with him at work it's going to be an argument about you not supporting him.", "NTA\n\n\nRelationships should have boundaries. The fact that his first response was to go straight to manipulation and guilt tripping is concerning. \n\n\nHe has a job. He should go to that.", "NTA. It sounds sensible for you to want this boundary (some people like being completely enmeshed in all aspects of their lives, but you do not and there is nothing wrong with that). His response is childish and disrespectful.", "Definitely NTA. It sounds like your boyfriend is not respecting a boundary you have pretty clearly and politely expressed to him. It is not your responsibility to help get him a job when he sounds very capable of getting a job all on his own, like most adults do. \n\nI would consider his response to your concerns a red flag for your relationship. Caring partners listen to each other and don\u2019t try to manipulate them when they don\u2019t get the outcome they want. The name-calling and specifically him saying that you \u201cdidn\u2019t give a shit\u201d about him made me cringe pretty hard to a previous unhealthy relationship of my own. People who care about you don\u2019t try to hurt you to get what they want. \n\nYou sound like you\u2019ve got it together, don\u2019t let this guy mess with your head.", "NTA.  That is a totally reasonable boundary for all the reasons you listed and more.\n\nHis response is pretty concerning though. Like it's understandable for him to be disappointed, but to claim that you \"didn't give a shit\" about him is deeply manipulative. Big red flag.", "NTA - living and working together is a lot tougher than people initially think it is, and I think you're wise to avoid it.", "NTA - most people know that living and working together are not a good combination. Very few relationships survive that.", "NTA\n\nLiving together is already challenging enough in a relationship. But living and working together 24/7 just lead your relationship age in dog years. That's just a recipe for disaster. \n\nYour boyfriend is young and probably more excited about your relationship. He wants to be with you at all times. I can understand that.\n\nCalmly explain to him about the practical issues around it. I'm not talking about giving ultimatums. Give him some time to think after a serious talk. Hope he understands you.", "NTA - you are being wise, romantically, and professionally. \n\nAlso, lovingly, your BF is fresh off the boat, job wise. He doesn't know what its like to work in an environment like that for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years etc..... I really think his youthful optomism is stopping him from seeing that you are *doing him a favour* in the long term. \n\nShow him this post, if it gets traction. Everyone a little older than you guys will be practically screaming *DON'T WORK WITH YOUR PARTNER ARE YOU INSANE*.", "NTA!\n\nYour BF is deflecting and his company is trying to assign tasks to employed that they aren't qualified and  under", "NTA  \n\n\nPersonally, I see no problem spending time together even 24/7. Of course, that implies respect for personal space and time from everyone involved. If that respect is one-sided, then it might not work.\n\nWorking together is a different story though. Hiring friends, family members and etc. is always a risk. They could treat you differently, could expect you to treat them differently and etc. In my experience, there was no problem introducing and hiring a friend is when I met that friend at previous job and we actually worked together for some time and thus I had very high confidence that everything would work well. Otherwise there are simply not enough data points to decide objectively.\n\nApart from that, red flag (at least for me) is an attempt to guilt trip OP.", "NTA, he\u2019s wrong to expect you to do something you\u2019ve expressed uncomfort in. It\u2019s okay to not want to work at the same field as your partner regardless of how common that is, let alone the same company same office.", "NTA. His reaction is very concerning.", "I think you're being very sensible. NTA", "NTA, 100%. I\u2019ve been in this exact situation - my now-ex was just as nasty to me as your boyfriend is being to you, though in my case my now-ex was wholly unqualified and asking me to lie for him.\n\nFrankly, your setting a boundary around your work life vs. personal life is just as good a reason as any moral code. Don\u2019t give in to his demands. If he keeps being nasty and/or insistent, you should probably break up with him.", "NTA, all of your reasons for not wanting to do this are totally valid, and his reaction should make you reconsider whether you actually want to move in with him.", "NTA \n\nThis is a perfectly reasonable concern. Being with a partner 24/7 can be the death of a relationship. So going from long distance to living and working together without any space may not be the healthy way to start your adult lives.", "NTA\n\nHowever, there are a few married couples at my work. They asked their manager to put them in separate departments or projects. So they drive to work together, and then don't see each other until the end of the day. Some eat lunch together, some don't. I don't know if this is possible for you though. One couple I know met at work as seatmates. When things started to get serious, one of them requested to be transferred out. If this boundary is available at your workplace, then maybe you could reconsider. Ask your superiors. They may already have experience with this kind of arrangement.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get sick of my kids on school breaks, love em, don't wanna hang out with em. My partner took 10 days off work to be with me and our youngest when she was hospitalized, by the time she was discharged I wanted nothing more than to sleep for a month and take a week-long bubble bath, I also started really hating the nurses, even though they were super sweet and very helpful. The only thing/person/whatever I can spend extended amounts of time with is my dog. We don't have to make conversation, he's a good cuddler, and he leaves me alone to do his own thing most of the time. \n\nI'm also an absolute introvert so idk maybe that's why I hate spending days on end with people, but I still do. I can't imagine working with and living with and dating my partner, it'd probably feel like losing my identity and independence to me.", "NTA. Some people work well together but in general it's healthy to have seperate jobs.\n\nBesides, what happens if he screws up or doesn't work well after you've recommended him?", "NTA only because that\u2019s how you feel but\u2026 I would absolutely love to work with my husband. We\u2019re trying to both work from home now. I can see how it might be hurtful for him in the sense that he may want to spend time, or just not be completely miserable at work.", "YTA \n\nlol. why is he not allowed to work whereh e wants to?", "Or, given how manipulative he is when denied, it could be that he is insecure or jealous about the time OP spends away from him interacting with other people.\n\nI hope it's just excitement but his behaviour is a red flag.", "This.\n\n Your work persona and how you act at work is completely diffetent to when you are chilling with bae. At work you have to be focused on getting shit done and cant prioritize him over othe colleagues. I bet he wouldn't like being treated like just another colleague. \n\nI think a lot of people would NOT work well with their romantic partner present. Both because most of them wouldn't go well as a team or would not be able to separate work stuff from home stuff.\n\nImo partners who are suspiciously obsessed with working with you are often jealous and insecure and want to make sure you don't get to spend time with other men,(or women) and would want you to pander to them at work. I doubt that OP's partner would be happy with a job in another department where he never gets to see OP.\n\n In order for him to be ready to work with her, he would have to recognise all the things people have mentioned here. But instead he is manipulative, demanding and short- sighted.", "You know she isnt stopping him, right? She just isnt trying to actively find him a job in her team. \n\nHe's acting manipulative and whiny because she doesnt want to sound 24 hours a day with him or rush their relationship by blurring work and personal boundaries and you think HE'S being deprived, here?\n\nUnless he wants her to then leave that job because of him,  because SHE also has z right to decide if she doesn't want to work with her romantic partner then he should at least ask how comfortable she is with it before considering moving. \n\nThere are plenty of jobs out there that are not in her department.", "Well.. that's an interesting take too."]}
