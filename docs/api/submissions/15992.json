On my birthday, my sister(42f) came over with cake and flowers, my boyfriend called me from work and in the middle of talking about something else, he said \u201coh haha happy birthday btw\u201d and when he came home and saw the flowers my sister got me, he said \u201cwell, I can\u2019t get you flowers now\u201d. We worked that whole week and he kept saying we were gonna do something for my birthday that weekend, but the weekend came and went and we didn\u2019t. Three more weeks passed with him promising something on the weekend, and on the past week, I told him not to worry about it, that I didn\u2019t care if we didn\u2019t do anything.\nSo, today is sister\u2019s birthday, and when he came looking for my opinion (read approval) on having his sister over for birthday dinner, I said no, and brought all of this up and said that she also has a boyfriend, why doesn\u2019t she ask her boyfriend to cook for her?

And you shouldn\u2019t! The way he behaved was not ok. He owes you a more serious, sincere apology with full recognition that he fucked up. It\u2019s a pretty basic thing to celebrate your partner\u2019s birthday. Not only did he not celebrate you, he failed to sincerely apologize on the spot and just said \u201cwell, I can\u2019t get you flowers now\u201d which is just doubling down on being TA. You guys need to agree on minimum standards for celebrating each other\u2019s birthdays. Stick to them. \n\nSo celebrate his sister\u2019s birthday and have a good time! Don\u2019t make her birthday about what he did wrong on yours. Also don\u2019t let him off the hook. He still has to apologize and actually do something to make it up to you!", "Holly shit, you are so childish, immature and petty. Of course you are the asshole here. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. People saying ESH, does this really apply when the sister hasn't done anything wrong?", "YTA.\nLearn how to tell your partner what exactly do you want.\nHis sister ask him to cook for her, so he will. If you asked him specifically, he would probably did the same for you. If you want surprise from him, tell him to surprise you.\nDon't punish his sister for your problems.", "YTA sister made plans for her birthday, you didnt", "NTA and I\u2019m surprised there aren\u2019t others! If y\u2019all were so damn busy that you couldn\u2019t celebrate your birthday, if y\u2019all so damn tired after a busy week that you can\u2019t celebrate your birthday, and y\u2019all so effffin busy with a newborn baby that you can\u2019t celebrate your birthday, you have EVERY RIGHT to say no to hosting for someone else\u2019s birthday and not wanting a mess in your kitchen!!!! People can\u2019t even see how your emotions getting in the way of storytelling isn\u2019t ultimately the issue with this. But your emotions seem pretty normal for the situation.\n\n\u201cOh I can\u2019t do anything for you haha but oh my sister!!! I neeeeed to do this for you you\u2019re cool and understand right?\u201d Yall I wouldn\u2019t want that weird shit in my house, either. The blatant disrespect from that man, that is some AH shit fasho. Especially seeing even the \u201cbest dads\u201d not doing nearly as much as the average mom on a regular basis.\n\nGirl I would go.", "YTA.\n\nJesus H fucking Christ!  You\u2019re a 35 yo grown ass woman, use your words!\n\nThis clearly ISN\u2019T about his sister or dinner, it\u2019s you holding a grudge (rightly or wrongly) about him not doing anything for your birthday and carrying it over to this. . . \n\nTell him how you ACTUALLY FEEL about him fucking it your birthday and try to figure out a way to move on or have him make it up to you, but most importantly find a way to get past it.", "YTA\n\nWhat he did to you sucks. It happens, but it sucks. Lots of changes right around your birthday does make things harder. But It's not his sister's fault and you're being extremely petty.", "The amount of people saying she's not the AH is surprising, she's throwing a tantrum over something she could've easily spoken up about, she's a toddler.", "ESH except your boyfriend's sister. Your boyfriend for forgetting your birthday and dropping the ball on making it up to you. You for taking your otherwise wholly understandable hurt over that out on his sister who had nothing to do with it", "YTA, here the sister has nothing to do with your drama, the problem is that your boyfriend did nothing to you so stop putting his sister in this circus", "NTA \nas a grown fucking man he should care about his girlfriends birthday more than that. idc what others said, i understand them too tbh, but the way he just ignored and forgot about you made me mad too. and he didnt even realize it was a problem, oh my goddd", "YTA. He is going to think you just don't like his sister. You didn't accurately communicate how upset you were over him ignoring your birthday. You can't just expect someone else to know how you feel. Especially when you dismiss your own feelings by telling him not to worry about because you don't care. You are in for a lifetime of disappointment if you just assume everyone else will understand your feelings without you having to explain them.", "YTA. His sister isn\u2019t the problem, your boyfriend is. He didn\u2019t care about your birthday-that\u2019s where he\u2019s at. You need to figure out if he cares enough to change or if you care enough about yourself and your kid to go.", "YTA for trying to make the argument about him doing something nice for his sister. NAH for being upset he didn't do anything for your birthday. Tell him about the real problem.", "ESH except the sister. There's nothing wrong with her wanting to celebrate her birthday with her brother! He screwed up on your birthday. He definitely sucks on that. There's no question. But don't tell him you don't care and then get mad because you do care. This isn't about his sister; this is about your feelings about your birthday.", "NTA, he can make it the day before and she can pick up a container of it. Or he can go to her place and make it.\n\nFor his birthday, text him happy birthday.", "To summarize:  You think sister shouldn\u2019t get something nice from bf for her birthday, because he didn\u2019t get anything nice for yours.   \n\nYeah, YTA.  This is a **petty**, tit-for-tat reaction (against a third party!), and you know it.    \n\nFigure out how to communicate your needs & feelings to your bf without punishing an innocent bystander.", "YTA?\n\nI'm new to Reddit and to the sub, so I think the rules are you have to give an opinion? So I guess, YTA.\n\nWith that said, I'm amazed by how many people are giving advice based on this one anecdote, ' leave that man he doesn't love you!\". \n\nLike many others have said, sit down and talk to him. Tell him how you're feeling and work it out. Don't punish his sister for a problem that the two of you are having. That's my advice.\n\nOn a side note, it amazes me how many people well into their 30s still care so much about their birthdays. I'm not judging; I have a good friend who is close to 50 and still cares about his birthday other people's birthdays. He takes it all very seriously. My wife and I recognize each other's birthdays with a birthday dinner and maybe a card. For milestone birthdays we do it up a little bit bigger of course. We make a big deal of our school-aged daughters birthdays, but at a certain age think it's time to grow up. But that's just me. You do you?", "I\u2019d say NTA.  It\u2019s petty but I get it.", "\"I told him not to worry about it, that I didn\u2019t care if we didn\u2019t do anything.\"\n\nSo you did the thing where you blatantly lied and *still held it against him* without even letting him know you really wanted him to make it up to you.\n\nJust be honest and say you're unhappy about something and don't sit on it for who knows how long taking it out on others. This isn't about the sister at all.\n\nYTA (for not communicating with your partner)", "Omg, OP, what are you 12?? Step 1: tell your bf he hurt your feelings with how he acted for you birthday. Make it known you would like for him to make it up to you. Step 2: welcome his sister for then to spend time celebrating her birthday. (A birthday that has nothing to do with yours and for a person who did NOT do anything to hurt you). Grow up. YTA.", "Yta because you told him you didn't care when you really really did care.", "This sounds stupid familiar to a post yesterday about a boyfriend making dinner/cake for a deceased sisters birthday in her honor and OP got trashed. YTA especially if this is a repost to make you look better.", "Sister isn't responsible for boyfriend's behavior. Don't punish her for his lack of thought and action.", "She kinda did.", "Maybe she would have been okay with him neglecting her birthday if he was too busy with work and/or tired from the baby to be able to make that level of effort. But seeing how this is just a few weeks later, it's clear that the issue isn't that he doesn't have it in him to make the effort, he's just not willing to make that effort for OP. I can see how that would be much more infuriating.\n\nIt's not right for OP to take it out on his sister, but hubby definitely messed up, and needs to make it up to OP. This should be ESH except for the sister.", "This, you should have dealt with this when it happened.", "Although I agree that they should communicate better, is something like her disappointment and sadness not super obvious to a man that\u2019s supposed to love her? I mean, they live together, do they not? He\u2019s intentionally ignoring her feelings of sadness. There is absolutely no way you could convince me she didn\u2019t show an ounce of sadness or disappointment when 1) he nonchalantly said \u201chappy b-day btw\u201d, 2) made a half-assed excuse of \u201coh, I can\u2019t get you flowers now haha\u201d when it was clear he had no intention to in the first place or had forgotten to entirely and was using this as an excuse (leaning more towards forgot and is using it as an excuse. Had he not forgotten, he would\u2019ve picked them up on his way home from work), and 3) continuously promise to make it up to her and continuously let her down repeatedly week after week. I\u2019m sorry but there is absolutely no way he didn\u2019t pick up on *something*. After calling it off the second time, she had to have shown some form of sadness. Even if she truly didn\u2019t care about her birthday, being promised one thing and him not delivering would get very hard to hide.\n\nSo, sure, she could communicate, but how did he not notice? Tells me he just doesn\u2019t care. I can spot if my gf is upset, hungry, sad, annoyed, irritated, or just tired from a mile away. She doesn\u2019t have to say a word, I can just read her face. Sometimes it\u2019s hard because she works in the medical field and is very, very good at masking her emotions. But, I love her and I pay attention to her. Why can\u2019t OP\u2019s bf? Like, idk man, seems he noticed but chose not to care.", "It was ok for him to miss her birthday because they are both tired parents. The hurt happened now because only weeks later he is willing to put the effort into it for his sister but not her. This is a new hurt that is exacerbated by an old one.", "She has no blame here at all. She should not be held responsible for her partner, a grown man, not knowing how hurtful he was. That she didn\u2019t tell him until later was because he repeatedly told her he would do something nice for her, which he never did.", "The OP shouldn't have the bear the mental load of planning her own birthday.", "He blew her off for 4 weeks then she said, just stop. Then he wanted to do something special for his sister. NTA.", "I think this is an important point. OP told husband she didn\u2019t care. That was not true.  And she is expressing a different position now. There are communication issues here. I wonder if there is some more info needed about OP\u2019s dynamic with the sister.  I hear all the NTA comments, but telling a brother he can\u2019t cook a dinner for his sister for her birthday on this record is assholish.", "I used to have a girlfriend like this. She would get wicked passive aggressive if I ever did anything nice for literally anyone. Then when I asked about it she would bring up something that's a totally separate issue and link it to this as being the same scenario and I treat her differently.\n\nWhat she wanted was for me to do something nice for her (I would do plenty of nice things, by the way, I'm not going to elaborate for the sole of everyone else's time).\n\nWhat happened was it made me so afraid to do anything for anyone because Everton would just set off the powder keg of an EX that I now have. Let word there. \n\nMy now wife? She loves it when we or even I do nice things for other people. And through that encouragement, we and I do nice things for her and for me as well. My point is to encourage the good behavior. That leads to more of that behavior. And steer it towards yourself, but I would think that by being a positive person to your boyfriend, that would just happen naturally.", "Exactly! Some of these comments are acting like his treatment of OP becomes better if he treats his sister badly too. No, it becomes better when he treats OP better.", "[removed]", "More respect?

Treating everyone badly just makes him even more of an AH.", "Bot, comment stolen from [heidismiles](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132u0kb/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_make_his/ji6sixp/).", "But at this point if he can put in the effort for his sister's birthday, he should be putting the effort in for his partners birthday first. You don't get to just skip your partner's birthday because you're tired unless they are okay with it, especially after you promised something over and over and over and over again for months. At that point, you start to feel like you are less of a priority, like you are less important. Just because you are parents, does not mean that you stop being a couple, or stop being individual people as well.", "And he couldn't pull something together*for months* after that? But can now for his sister? \n\nFuck that noise. OP deserves better -- because anyone deserves better.

I see we have a problem with communication and you personally have a real problem with understanding but in your case it's not cultural, you're just *OMG* *those* *people are different how can it be alarm alarm*.", "Yes it's kind of weird and toxic but since you're a child you're told that your real soulmate would understand everythind without telling and if you have to tell them then it's not real love. So it's hard to get rid of that (it's Ukraine), also people can think that you're weird if you tell what you think straightforward", "I do agree with that entirely. Unfortunately though, some people legitimately don't think of birthdays as that big of a deal and if something is important you can't just let it go passively. After a week or two of no follow through, it would've been healthy for OP to have a conversation where they didn't lie and say \"it doesn't matter\", but instead told their partner that celebrating birthdays is important to them and that they felt disregarded by how their birthday was handled and that they would like to either do x for their birthday, even if that x is \"i want you to plan a surprise date for us Saturday for my birthday\" because then OPs needs and wants have been clearly stated. If the wishes were disregarded at that point and bf was still cooking sister dinner, then it would be obvious the bf doesn't care and he'd be the only asshole.", "She is talking in the past tense now, because she is talking about something in the past. \"I don't care if we didn't do something\" - the if is still a question therefore talking about the then-future; \"I don't care if we didn't do something at this point\", she didn't say \"I don't care that we didn't do something up to now\".", "But she did tell him she was okay with it. Now she\u2019s doing an about-face. \n\nI get it, new parents are frazzled, schedules get thrown out of whack, nerves get frayed. And inevitably one partner feels the other isn\u2019t doing enough. \n\nThis is where open communication is key. Her issue isn\u2019t about the sisters birthday, it\u2019s that he missed hers.
