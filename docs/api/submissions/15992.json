On my birthday, my sister(42f) came over with cake and flowers, my boyfriend called me from work and in the middle of talking about something else, he said \u201coh haha happy birthday btw\u201d and when he came home and saw the flowers my sister got me, he said \u201cwell, I can\u2019t get you flowers now\u201d. We worked that whole week and he kept saying we were gonna do something for my birthday that weekend, but the weekend came and went and we didn\u2019t. Three more weeks passed with him promising something on the weekend, and on the past week, I told him not to worry about it, that I didn\u2019t care if we didn\u2019t do anything.\nSo, today is sister\u2019s birthday, and when he came looking for my opinion (read approval) on having his sister over for birthday dinner, I said no, and brought all of this up and said that she also has a boyfriend, why doesn\u2019t she ask her boyfriend to cook for her?

Her asking was probably just her wanting to celebrate her birthday with her sibling and family which seems totally fine and normal to me. It's several weeks after, so unless bf's told his sister (which seems unlikely from the amount of thought he's put into OP) it would seem reasonable for her to assume she wasn't at risk of interrupting OP's birthday plans by asking for that.", "Wait, why\u2019s the sister an AH? What\u2019d I miss?", "What did sister do wrong?", "I know people who never pick up on these things. They are always oblivious. I'm not saying it's okay but the bf sounds like them.

We're talking about adults here.", "It depends on the person. My parents were raised not to talk about their feelings in depth. I similarly. It\u2019s something I struggled with for awhile and I was also raised pretty closed off from a large group of people (small, desert towns, military family) and it\u2019s taken me many years to kinda learn how to open up. Because of this, I was the quiet chick in the back of the room that just observed. Which, is why I\u2019m pretty good at picking up on body language and emotions just a *bit* better than most. \n\nNow, I\u2019m not saying I can take one glance at my gf and be like \u201cyep, she needs a burrito\u201d but I can tell when she\u2019s angry/upset/irritated because of her body language and she has a bad habit of biting down (not quite like grinding her teeth but just biting so I can see her jaw muscles flex) and her entire demeanor is different. When she\u2019s sad, you can see it in her eyes and she\u2019s very, very quiet. When she\u2019s hungry it\u2019s a bit harder to tell, but usually if she hasn\u2019t eaten all day I can notice. So, no, although I don\u2019t have a crystal ball that says her *exact* emotion, I can tell something is wrong and usually what general catergory it falls into (hungry and tired in one, angry/upset/irritated in another, and sad or socially drained) and I ask her what it is. She was raised fairly similarly to me so, even though she\u2019s older, she was very closed off from a lot of people. She\u2019s a lesbian woman to 2 very homophobic parents. Tends to shut you down early in life. We\u2019ve both grown as individuals, and we talk \u201clike adults\u201d and discuss feelings, concerns, emotions, etc. but, that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t tell something\u2019s wrong before she says it.\n\nI mean, you\u2019ve never gone up to a family member, friend, coworker, etc. and been like \u201chey, you seem (enter emotion, usually sad), is everything okay?\u201d Like, is that not any different than what I do with my gf? \u201cHey, you seem sad, are you ok? Want to talk about it?\u201d. It just so happens that we\u2019ve been together for a number of years so she doesn\u2019t really have to verbalize it as much.\n\nI do find it funny you tattled on yourself, though. This is basic human interactions here, not some deep physiological mind play. If she\u2019s upset, I can tell. Sad, disappointed, whatever, I can tell. It reeeeally isn\u2019t that hard. Just because *you* don\u2019t pay attention to your partner doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is just as dense. It would be clear as crystals that OP was upset and just because you and her bf wouldn\u2019t have picked up on it doesn\u2019t mean *she* is the problem, but rather the 2 of you are.", "The way I read it, it's in a complicated tense, was that this long after the fact it's too late.\n\nBesides, with his flowers comment you know he's doing as little as possible.", "But now you're pitting your boyfriend against his sister. It should be addressed as \"I want to make a bigger deal out of my birthday.\" And \"I think you're making too big of a deal out of your sister's birthday.\"\n\nThe two obviously share a lot of similarities. But when you wait until a separate event to bring up how upset you were about something else,  it muddies the point. She wants her birthday to be more special and wants to do something to commemorate it. She should explain that.\n\nI doubt she simply doesn't want him o do anything for his sister. That just makes her jealous, understandable, but beside the point. She should keep her frustration to her own birthday and be more up front about what she wants to do in the future.", "You\u2019re completely missing my point. It\u2019s childish to not communicate with your partner and expect them to know what\u2019s wrong with you. That\u2019s not how adults behave in a healthy relationship. Knowing  that your partner is upset is not an excuse to not express your feelings.", "That's a mistake people make. Nobody can read your mind, not even your 'soul mate'. You need to learn to speak up when something is bothering you when it happens, not weeks later. \n\nOP should have told her partner that she was hurt that he didn't acknowledge her birthday even though they were both tired. That she wants to know that he remembers what is important to her and makes her feel special.

That changes the context entirely.", "Yeah that's how it goes round these parts", "Right? I'm 29, and for my birthday last year I was pregnant and had a toddler, both my husband and I were working full time jobs. He still made a point to bring me home flowers and cook me a nice dinner. \n\nIf someone loves you and appreciates you, they'll find the time.

Perhaps it's the \"new generation\" of people, but it just is what it is to me. If I got ghosted, ignored, or gotten the cold shoulder for something I didn't know someone was upset about, then yea, I'd react with a \"what the fuck\", and it would lead (eventually) to a break-up, but this isn't that. OP also doesn't say if they did or did not give the cold shoulder, so I assume it's something leaning toward shutting down or simply pretending everything is ok. Which, again, I disagree with her methods, and as I've said previously, \\*She does in fact need to communicate better\\*.   \n\n\nA reason she might not have spelled it out to him is because, maybe, she has in the past and he didn't catch on. Or, maybe she felt it was a stupid thing to get upset over so she didn't. I don't know, I'm not OP. Maybe I'd know more if I was their neighbor but I'm not that either. I'm just simply stating that I don't understand how you couldn't pick up on any q's when you cancel on the chick 4 times. Like, you would have to be seriously, seriously, seriously dense to not pick up on \\*anything\\* at all after canceling 4 times, barely remembering her Birthday, saying \"happy b-day btw\" over the phone (they live together, do remember that part), and not getting her anything at all. Like, I can understand a lot, but not that. This is just blatant disrespect. If he didn't pick up on the q's once or twice, fine, but \\*really\\* after all that, he didn't catch on to \\*anything at all\\*? Nah. That's not \"some people don't pick up on non-verbal q's\" that's \"I don't care enough to pay attention to my gf so I'll ignore it and pretend everything is peachy keen jelly bean\".", "I could understand if this wasn't a big deal, y'know. Like, maybe not wanting to share your food and your partner getting upset but not showing it. I understand not picking up on that. But, this is a \\*birthday\\*, and presumably, OP never told her BF she hates her birthday or doesn't want to celebrate. It isn't far-fetched to assume someone wants to do \\*something\\*, even if it's small (like a dinner, which this is), for their birthday. She even communicated to him that she did, in fact, want to celebrate by going out to eat. Then, she got pushed aside not once, not twice, not even three times, but FOUR times. Four. I'm not always the nicest or brightest person, and I've certainly missed some non-verbal q's and can be labeled oblivious (normally when it comes to women flirting with me. I just assume every woman is straight until told, to my face, that they would like to date. It's much easier that way honestly, so I do very much so get the \"maybe they're just oblivious\" comments), but c'mon, you don't even feel guilty for canceling last minute FOUR times? I feel guilty if I do it once. I really don't feel like she has to scream from the rooftops \"I'm angry you didn't do anything for my birthday like you said you would\" because, like, he canceled on her so many times and made it seem like it wasn't a big deal in the slightest. Maybe in the beginning, it wasn't a big deal to OP. She was ok with him not really remembering her birthday, and she was ok with not getting flowers or a gift, and it's even possible she was okay with him canceling once or twice, but at some point, even the densest of people have got to realize \"wait, maybe my gf isn't really ok with this?\" or \"I wonder if I'll make my gf sad if I cancel again\".   \n\n\nI wouldn't have said anything at all if he didn't cancel so many times. Not getting anything for the birthday? Fine. Barely remembering it and wishing her a happy b-day over the phone? Alright. Canceling birthday plans once? Shit happens. Twice?

But I guess he\u2019s a great brother so clearly he is capable of understanding what this whole celebrating birthday thing is.", "Woman OR Man, just any human being in general.", "Or perhaps the man can give a flying fuck without the woman having to recite a speech about why her birthday is important?", "I mean, maybe initially she was fine, but then got upset seeing as how quickly he could come up with something to do for his sister but not for her. Jealousy isn't great, but can't say I haven't felt this way before. Being human happens.", "She told him for three weeks, when you repeatedly communicate your needs to someone and they ignore you they're the one at fault, even if after weeks of this you give up hope and stop bothering.", "My point is, it isn\u2019t hard at all to notice. \n\nPerhaps it\u2019s because she didn\u2019t want to care about it and didn\u2019t want it to bother her but it simply did. Or, perhaps she thought it was stupid that she was upset.\n\nOr, perhaps she was raised like me and had a hard time expressing herself. It isn\u2019t always childish if you were conditioned for 18-20+ years to think a certain way. \n\nHe should\u2019ve noticed. The fact he didn\u2019t is childish. My point wasn\u2019t disagreeing with what the original person I was replying to said, but rather a \u201chow literally could you not notice\u201d because like\u2026 literally how could you not notice it bothered her. \n\nI even literally said I agreed, twice, that she should communicate. So, I clearly communicated twice to you that I understood your response, and even AGREED with it, I outlined it crystal clear at least once, and you STILL didn\u2019t understand what I was communicating to you. So, *perhaps* it\u2019s possible OP did communicate it and her bf just didn\u2019t get it. Similar to how I communicated the fact I agreed with you *twice* and you still didn\u2019t get it. \n\nI\u2019ll say it again: I AGREE WITH YOU. She should be communicating more. BUT *I* don\u2019t see how a grown ass adult who had been in a relationship with someone for more than 6 months (and, although it doesn\u2019t specify how long they\u2019ve been together, OP mentions they had a baby last year. If they were a 1 night stand situation, that\u2019s *at least* 9 months together, and since it happened \u201clast year\u201d and it\u2019s nearly May, we can add 5 months to the 9 months) doesn\u2019t clearly see when the person he is supposed to love is upset, disappointed, or sad, that tells me he pays zero attention to OP. My situation with my gf isn\u2019t unique, but I also understand not everyone has what we have. That\u2019s fine. But not understanding BASIC human emotions is just pathetic.\n\nThe fact that I clearly communicated to you twice and you still didn\u2019t get it, yet you blame OP for \u201cnot being an adult and communicating\u201d is just laughable. You must be a wonderful partner.", "You called it fiction, then clarify that childish immature couples have troubles with communication. Which is it?", "Sure, I know.\nI mean that it's hard to even realise that you should just say what you want  when girls are literally told NOT TO do that.\nSo if op is really from my country I don't think she can be blamed, it's not her fault, it's a problem she should deal with.", "I'm honestly lost when my birthday comes around because it's also my husband's birthday. But even my husband who often forgets birthdays (grew up as a Jehovah Witness) does something for me. Might take him a bit to remember but he at least follows through because he knows that birthday's are important to me. I feel bad though because it's also his birthday and i have no idea what to do. We often end up getting him a game though and he's pretty fine with that at least", "He didn\u2019t come up with something for his sister.

You just didn\u2019t understand my initial comment.", "Yeah, I forgot that amongst reading all the comments, but I still feel the same about what I said. She could have gotten over it after being told a few times that he would do something and just dismissed it when he kept not doing it. \n\nI've done that. After a while, you get tired of empty promises, and you would rather not keep waiting around for something that doesn't happen. \n\nSo then, to see that the moment the sister requests something, it happens. Yeah, I'd be salty, call me the sea.", "You changed it from tldr to that? Weird.   \n\n\nHe canceled 4 times, technically 8-12 times (He said over the weekend, not specifically which day), Didn't get her anything for her Birthday, and said \"happy b-day\" over the phone in an off-handed comment. I believe even men like you would start to pick up on \\*something\\*. Anything. Don't pretend you're some helpless creature that can't even wash the dishes properly.

Find a calm time and tell your bf how you feel and ask for what you need.", "What a weird relationship. Unless you guys communicate thoroughly, i dont know how you guys gonna survive off of passive aggressive behavior.", "YTA and stop acting like you are pouting like a child.

Him for not doing anything for your birthday (what a jerk) and you for being passive aggressive about the whole thing. His sister didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Period. Your boyfriend did.

So we have to that into the equation. \n\nBoyfriend planned nothing for girlfriend's birthday. \n\nBoyfriend promised to do something for girlfriend's birthday for a total of 4 weekends before getting an ok to stop.\n\nSo, boyfriend plans nothing, gifts nothing, and does not even get a babysitter (you know like sister?) So he could show his girl and mother of his child that she is loved and appreciated.\n\nHmmmm. After 4 weeks it probably was fine that he did not make another promise he didn't intend to keep.

You need to tell your boyfriend how you want to celebrate your birthday. It would be nice to have a romantic boyfriend but he has showed you, he is not that.

Since he is willing to cook for his sister for her birthday because she asked, he shows he can put in the work. Some people just don\u2019t have it in them to be creative about birthday gifts.
