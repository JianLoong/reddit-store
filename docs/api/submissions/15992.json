On my birthday, my sister(42f) came over with cake and flowers, my boyfriend called me from work and in the middle of talking about something else, he said \u201coh haha happy birthday btw\u201d and when he came home and saw the flowers my sister got me, he said \u201cwell, I can\u2019t get you flowers now\u201d. We worked that whole week and he kept saying we were gonna do something for my birthday that weekend, but the weekend came and went and we didn\u2019t. Three more weeks passed with him promising something on the weekend, and on the past week, I told him not to worry about it, that I didn\u2019t care if we didn\u2019t do anything.\nSo, today is sister\u2019s birthday, and when he came looking for my opinion (read approval) on having his sister over for birthday dinner, I said no, and brought all of this up and said that she also has a boyfriend, why doesn\u2019t she ask her boyfriend to cook for her?
