It was a tragic accident where a caregiver fell asleep and the child managed to get out of the house.

Make sure your FIL fences the backyard/pool and puts up a no trespassing sign. If one of the children drowns when no one is home you could get charged with multiple things.

A locking fence is a vital piece of protection for anyone with a pool. I wouldn\u2019t allow it to go another day. \n\nPut up no trespassing signs. \n\nGet a lawyer to send a letter telling them they are not allowed in your pool or on your property. Do not invite them over even with a parent/adult. The mom has proven she cannot be trusted. She is not a safe person to allow on your property. \n\nThe liability is FAR too great.
