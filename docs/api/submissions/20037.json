{"id": 20037, "submission_id": "14d3c10", "title": "AITA for being honest with my GF?", "selftext": "Throwaway because we both use Reddit and follow each other.\n\nI (35M) recently helped my GF (22F) and her family organize a party for her college graduation. I showed up about 20 minutes before the party started and helped her family set up the table of snacks, the cake, and some decorations such as balloons and banners. It was a good time overall, but less people showed up than expected. It was basically just the family that was in town for the graduation and her best friend. She had invited people she knew from her college, but none of them made it. No big deal though, because it was still a fun time. Or so I thought. For context, she has always been sort of the loner type and has a hard time being social and making friends, which may have had something to do with what happened next.\n\nAfter the party, she seemed upset, so I asked what was wrong. She said she hoped that her other friends from college would come to the party because she wanted to see them before they went their separate ways. I told her to cheer up and be grateful for the people who did come, such as her best friend. She seemed kind of upset at this for some reason. I was only trying to make her feel better, so I'm not sure why this upset her. She then said something like \"I just wanted them to be here, that's all.\" To this, I simply pointed out that she is not a very outgoing person and that maybe she should have gotten to know them better. This didn't seem to help, as she just got even more angry at me and started screaming at me over this. She said that it's not her fault and a bunch of other stuff that I honestly don't remember because I was so overwhelmed in the moment.\n\nThis is where I might be the AH. I couldn't take the screaming anymore, so I snapped. I told her to stop overreacting and acting like a spoiled brat, and that at least she wasn't completely alone for her party. Of course, she stormed away in a huff after this and hasn't been answering her phone since. I might have crossed the line when I said this, but at the same time I don't think my reaction was too unreasonable. Like, I put in so much effort to make her graduation special, and now she acts like this when one tiny aspect of it doesn't go her way. Any reasonable person would've had enough at this point.\n\nHer best friend and family apparently found out about this, probably because she cried to them about it, and my phone has been blowing up for a few days now calling me all sorts of names, which has honestly been really bad for my mental health. I feel really alone in this situation and nobody seems to want to see my side of the story. All I did was offer my honest opinion about the situation and try to cheer her up, and she took it all personal and got emotional over it. I feel like our relationship is probably over, so I guess I just want to get closure with the knowledge of whether or not it was my fault.

She didn't want you to give her reasons or excuses or fixes for the lack of attendance at that party. She was just hurt, feeling down, and wanting to express it. She was looking for a bit of sympathy and comfort. And all you did was try to explain the why's of it all.

You asked her what was wrong and instead of listening you told her she should have been more social at college and then stoped listening to her all together because you were \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d \n\nSo, after not listening to the \u201cbunch of stuff\u201d she was trying to share with you, you \u201csnapped\u201d and called her names. Then you try to justify it by saying you put in \u201cso much effort\u201d for her party while at the start you said you helped the family for 20 minutes.\n\nFrankly even if you had thrown the party asking someone to talk with you, not listening to that person, then blowing up at them is an asshole move. \n\nYeah dude, YTA.", "Oh dear, another \u2018I was just being honest\u2019 post.

For you to try be \u201chonest\u201d and tell her she wasn\u2019t outgoing is so rude. I hate when people give unsolicited opinions and slap on the guise of it just being honest to try to justify it. This was not the time nor the place for this comment; she was clearly upset and idek what that comment was hoping to achieve. \n\nYou make it out like her not being outgoing is a bad thing and that explains why her friends weren\u2019t there which is totally wrong.

The way you were talking to her, calling her a spoiled brat and all is icky knowing the age gap.", "Lol...yea...you are TAH.  How do you think telling her she should be grateful that anyone showed up is going to cheer her up? Maybe you didn't say it that way, but that is exactly how it sounded.

This is a valid emotion to feel, especially if she was expecting more people. Rather than empathising, you trivialised her feelings by pointing out that some people came and she should be grateful for them. She no doubt was, but that doesn\u2019t invalidate her sadness.  \n\nBut then you doubled down by suggesting it was her fault not more people had come. Now you\u2019re not just trivialising, you\u2019re actively blaming her for the situation and suggesting she had no right feeling that way, which again, is entirely unfair. \n\nAnd the snapping is the real veer into YTA territory for me. Obviously it\u2019s never healthy to have a screaming match, but you called her a spoilt brat over a perfectly valid emotion. The way you also point out how much you did sounds like you wanted her to fawn over your efforts and were lashing out because she didn\u2019t, but was upset about not as many people coming. You owe her an apology at the very least.", "Oof times 10. YTA. You messed up and badly. She was lamenting the lack of people and then, instead of consoling or supporting her, you said it was her fault.

There's a lot to say about that but it'd likely get me banned.", "YTA\n\nYou know what would have prevented all this? Just listen and say sorry they couldn\u2019t make it.
