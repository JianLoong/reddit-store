She was exactly the type of dog my family had wanted so my whole family agreed and welcomed her into our home no questions asked. She has been the sweetest most loving dog anyone could ask for while also being protective. She has been there through so many challenges in our lives, so many tears, every celebration. Additionally we noticed she got a little skittish with certain movements or things we did day to day that made us think she was also abused in her last home. \n\nFlash forward to now. Her old owner is now wanting her back because she loved her so much and wants a family dog now that she feels the kid is old enough. My family, of course said no because she has been a member of our family for so long and with everything we had seen on top of the abandonment wounds we patched up, we didn\u2019t want to abandon her too. This was not a fostering situation, it was adoption. On top of that we didn\u2019t feel it was right to give her back to someone who gave her up just because she was an inconvenience to the old owners life. The old owner went off saying that she was hers first and demanding we give her back.

This is the second post I've seen where the original owners just treat their dogs like toys that can be tossed aside and then picked right back up when they want them back.

Days, or weeks, *maybe*, but YEARS?!? It would be cruel to the dog to give her back, even if it was an amazing home. Pretty sure after that long, even if it WAS a \"misunderstanding\" (which is BS by the way), no court would ever side with her unless she was covering all the dog's expenses and paying you to care for her the entire time....then there might be a question that it was an arrangement.

I say it's a bit too late to bring that dog back to your friend's coworker especially 8 years has pass. If the owner visited the dog daily and walked the dog, helped paid for it's food then I can say the dog should go back to it's original family, but after years went by, that dog bonded with you and she should look for a similar dog and maybe have a play date with your dog.", "I have guardianship for a dog.

She may have bought the dog as a puppy but she gave her up, prioritising her baby.

This dog turned out to be that once in a lifetime dog that was perfect. So sweet, loyal, smart. The day we lost him, I was totally devastated. It was in 2020 during the pandemic and we had to say goodbye in the parking lot. They brought a stretcher out to the parking lot and I lost it. I was hugging him, told him I was so sorry, how much we loved him  and how he was so special and then my husband had to pull me away. I just fell to my knees crying like I have never cried before.

He had a chip, so the vet called the owners. The cat had been missing for TWO YEARS! The owner came to meet up with me and asked if I wanted to \u201ckeep the cat\u201d. I was flabbergasted.

He was found in poor health by second owner .She then moved to NC.After 8 years she took him to a local  Vet, who scanned Bob and told her he belonged to Kansas lady .Bob made the news .Kansas owner demanded him back and ultimately won the case", "Eight years!\n\nSome dog breeds barely even live that long.", "So, legally, a pet is a possession. Weirdly, that doesn't help the previous owners case. If you gave someone a jacket 8 years ago, and suddenly decided you wanted it back, no court would find in your favor. \n\nEven if suddenly, something had happened to make that jacket incredibly valuable, no court would find in your favor. \n\nAnd I'm not usually one to say 'just get another dog', but good god, it's got to be easier than tracking down an old acquaintance and bothering them for a pet you gave up.", "NTA.  It's been eight years.  It would be different if it was a couple months.  Is she going to reimburse for all the vet bills, and the time you've spent training the dog?  They can go get another dog?  Tell them to lose your number, or block her.", "I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't want to run the risk she'd agree to it.", "All the same, you should definitely make sure the microchip is still registered in one or more free databases, and also that your dog license is valid for this year.", "Yeah, I think at this point the coworker should just go get another pet... or not since they've already abandoned one!", "I agree. That's why I suggested they make sure to chip the dog, in case the previous owners take matters into their own hands.", "Even 8 months would have been long enough to rationalize keeping a dog. Once a pet is welcomed and ingrained in the family, it should stay with that family. \n\nI think a lot of people like the idea of a dog, or getting the dog back more than actually being happy about having the dog back.", "Tack on boarding fees that are 10% lower than the local daily rate. No way she'd agree to that... but if somehow she does, might even be worth considering. For 8 years at $30/day, that's almost $90,000. I might even write up a formal bill and tell her she can pick up the dog when the bill is paid in full. Until then, $30/day is added to the bottom line.", "NTA  And she Can get a pet now that she feels her child is old enough.  She  just cannot have this one.", "Where the hell do these crazy people think they are entitled to get whatever they want. Definitely NTA!", "NTA OP.  You\u2019ve had this dog 8 years, and now the original owner wants her back?  I think that even the judges on some of these TV courtroom shows would take one look at the case and throw it out.", "NTA... the dog was rehomed. The dog is in a good home. \n\n2 good reasons not to move the dog again.", "Wtf? A pet isn\u2019t a thing to pass around like a power tool. NTA, she has not a leg to stand on here.", "NTA!! \n\nIf it was eight days later, sure, that would be justified, but eight years later and now they want that doggo.?. That would be a hell no for me, that dog is your family and has been for nearly a decade.\n\nYou are so not in the wrong OP!! :)", "NTA. Absolutely do not give her back. This is your dog.", "NTA Eight years?! It is your dog now and the former owner is being ridiculous.", "Fuck no, keep your dog. NTA", "Oh, hell no...NTA", "NTA. She has no legal leg to stand on, and frankly, she's ridiculous. But feel free to say, oh, is it your dog? Then we need you to pay for all the food, supplies, and vet bills we've incurred over the last years. I'll make a tally and we can talk after you pay it all back with interest. Also for our time in caring for your dog, and for boarding it.", "NTA the dog is yours. Ignore her old owner. She threw the dog out because she wanted to prioritize her baby. That\u2019s her choice but she doesn\u2019t get the dog back.", "Dogs aren\u2019t library books!! NTA", "\r  \nOP, are you silly? I say it crudely, since it is obvious that you should send that woman to eat poop. You and your family adopted that little dog, that is your pet and as you say, a member of the your family. \n\nShe has no right to ask for anything.", "Definitely keep the dog", "NTA.  She gave you that dog and it is yours now.  9 years!!!! Add up all the cost of food, toys,leashes,accessories, vet bills, license fees etc for the past 8 years and multiply it by the amount of love each of you has for that dog.  That is the current value of that dof.", "Nta", "NTA.  \n\n\nThey gave up a pup. That dog has known your family as family and safety for 8 years. It would be so confused to be abandoned by you.  \n\n\nThey can get another pup.", "NTA. I hope you document the injuries she had. \n\nIf they go to court over the dog bring the paper work for the costs incurred while in your care. Very, food and boarding", "She wants YOUR dog. She can't have her.\n\nNTA", "EIGHT years?! That's practically a lifetime. This person is insane", "My dad sold a house many years ago that he still misses. Think I'll take him on a trip there and tell the new owners it was his first and he wants it back, he's ready to live there again now.\n\nSuch absolute bs.  \n\nGive that pup some extra skritches just as. Acongratulations for not having to go back to the crazy, and keep on loving her.  \n\nTell the old owner to get a stuffed animal.\n\nNta", "NTA. She gave away the dog therefore not her dog, but your dog as y\u2019all had her long enough to form a bond and breaking that suddenly could traumatize the doggo.", "NTA\nYou took in a dog for 8 years and fell in love with the dog. Anyone thinking that they can just take the dog back is just crazy to me.\nI have a deal with my parents that if for any reason I am not able to take care of my dog, they would take her till I got on my feet. But I have the heart to understand that after 8 years, my dog would become theirs. \nThe fact that you seem to have either noticed neglect and got the dog out of a bad situation is good for you and keep the dog.", "8 years??? No way NTA, it\u2019s insane to even think of asking for your pet back after that long. If she hasn\u2019t ever expressed wanting the dog back before she probably only has ants it now because y\u2019all have trained and tamed it. Y\u2019all are not in the wrong for keeping the dog y\u2019all have raised for 8 years", "NTA. You can\u2019t decide you want the pet back once you\u2019ve given them up for adoption. It\u2019s not like she asked you to watch the dog for a few weeks while moving or something. It\u2019s been YEARS.", "nta\n\n8 yrs??? and she wants it back--NOPE.  Without a legal contract saying you were caring for the dog until child was old enough or something insane like that, with proof she paid you for all the food, vet bills etc for that interim time, she does not have the right to YOUR DOG.\n\nTell coworker where she can find pigs flying because maybe she'll find a dog there too.", "NTA. The old owner gave up the dog. End of story.\n\nEven if there had been an agreement to reclaim when child was old enough, abuse would negate that", "NTA\n\nThe dog is part of your family now. It'd be cruel for the original owner to take him back.", "NTA. You've had the dog for 8 years. The average lifespan of a dog is 12 to 13 years. You didn't say how old the dog was when you got it, but you've already had it for what will be the majority of its life. It's your dog. If they had wanted you to foster the dog for 8 years they should have been very clear on that because it's pretty unreasonable. Keep the dog, they sound like jerks. And thank you for giving this pooch a good home!", "The previous owner gave you her dog 8 years ago and she wants the dog back? What reality does that owner live in? \n\nThe average age of a dog is 10 to 13 years. Your dog is past midlife and transitioning to a new home would be traumatic and extremely hard to adapt to. \n\nThat previous owner does not care for the dog at all. She/He is probably romanticizing the reunion and failing to comprehend the dog she/he gave away is not the same dog she is today.\n\nIts unfortunate for the previous owner,  but the dog is yours.  Keep her. \n\nNTA", "Nah, Keep her. That's Your dog. Tell the ex owner to pound sand.", "Nta. Tell her if she really thought it was a foster type situation, why hasn\u2019t she checked in before now? Why hasn\u2019t she sent money for food, toys, beds, blankets, vet bills?  It\u2019s clearly obvious that she didn\u2019t expect to get the dog back. It\u2019s been 8 yrs. The dog would be traumatized. BUT don\u2019t assume because a dog is skittish or hand shy that they have been abused. That\u2019s not always the case. But trust your gut. She has no legal or moral right to the dog. I wouldn\u2019t give the dog back, take me to court ( I don\u2019t see any judge or jury siding w her & she would be responsible for every penny you\u2019ve spent. But more than that, it would be cruel to do that to a dog or your children", "The old owner has no claim on your dog after giving her to you 8..8!!! years ago.", "Shes yours. Tell her to pound sand.", "tell her the dog is now legally yours, and when she threatens to sue, insist that all further communication be through her non-existent lawyer", "Thank you for doing that taking care of a pet for a person in the Military is supporting our troops.", "How did you get involved with this? I think this would be a lovely way to help service members!", "What happened to the cat?", "Anyone that dumps a pet out of their home, and then shows up 8 years later without warning is absurdly entitled.\n\nShe's YOUR pupper :)", "Sure, she looked at baby and thought, \"WTF! Not again!\"", "Stay that way.  You are not the AH.  They gave her up . STAND YOUR GROUND. DO NOT LET HER HAVE IT BACK.", "Make sure to have updated chip", "And not even then!", "Right? The dog has lived at least half its life if not more with OP and this woman has the *nerve* to think she can just take it back like she just left for the weekend?", "And while you\u2019re at it, OP, make damn sure that she\u2019s chipped, in case the former owner tries to do something really dumb.", "Well, original owner was obviously treating OP as a doggy day care if seems? Let\u2019s say\u2026 $15/day for \u201cextended stay.\u201d\n\nSo, 365x15x8? (+2 leap days?)= $43830 in just boarding costs!\n\nThat, plus vet bills, food\u2026 I\u2019d say give her an invoice for over $50k!", "It\u2019s so nice to know your dad can be returned home if they get out.  A chip really helps me worry a bit less about our dogs.", "I tried to get my dad chipped, but he threw an absolute fit... The dogs don't seem to mind one way or the other though.", "I had to settle for writing my phone number in Sharpie on my Dad\u2019s forehead while he slept. No way he would have let me get him chipped.", "My hubby didn\u2019t mind.  And the little bump is hardly noticeable. \ud83e\udd23.  This would be funny except he doesn\u2019t leave the house, even when I leave the gate open."]}
