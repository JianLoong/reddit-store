She was exactly the type of dog my family had wanted so my whole family agreed and welcomed her into our home no questions asked. She has been the sweetest most loving dog anyone could ask for while also being protective. She has been there through so many challenges in our lives, so many tears, every celebration. Additionally we noticed she got a little skittish with certain movements or things we did day to day that made us think she was also abused in her last home. \n\nFlash forward to now. Her old owner is now wanting her back because she loved her so much and wants a family dog now that she feels the kid is old enough. My family, of course said no because she has been a member of our family for so long and with everything we had seen on top of the abandonment wounds we patched up, we didn\u2019t want to abandon her too. This was not a fostering situation, it was adoption. On top of that we didn\u2019t feel it was right to give her back to someone who gave her up just because she was an inconvenience to the old owners life. The old owner went off saying that she was hers first and demanding we give her back. I don\u2019t feel like my family is in the wrong but we could be due to maybe misunderstanding why we were taking her in the first place or refusing to give her back.", "created_utc": 1697729280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17blu68/aita_wefor_refusing_to_give_up_our_dog/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That same thing happened to a friend of mine. She ended up keeping her pet, and you should too. The previous owner abandoned the dog. It's yours now. EIGHT years. NTA", "Woah what the fuck. \n\nNTA\n\nSo not give that dog back. You can\u2019t just abandon a dog for 8 years and expect to get it back at any point. \n\nYour coworker is unhinged. That\u2019s insane behaviour.", "NTA, but please make sure pup\u2019s chip details are up to date. That\u2019s YOUR dog.", "NTA.  There is no misunderstanding here.  If she had a temporary placement in mind, it wouldn't have been EIGHT YEARS.  She changed her mind back and doesn't like not getting her way, that's all.", "NTA\n\nThis has been your dog for 8 years.\n\nThe person making this request is being completely selfish and isn't even considering the well-being of the dog.", "NTA. This is the second post I've seen where the original owners just treat their dogs like toys that can be tossed aside and then picked right back up when they want them back. Pets are a serious commitment and you understand that. I mean come on... You've had the animal for years and honestly, if I suspected abuse? I wouldn't give it back even if i only had the dog for a week.", "NTA. She abandoned her dog for being an inconvenience and wants it back after EIGHT YEARS? Come on. After that long, it would be cruel to the dog to rip it away from the only home it's ever known. This woman is a piece of work. Make sure your pups chip info is up to date and block this lady.", "NTA. It goes one of two ways: 1) you adopted the dog and the dog is yours; or 2) you were just keeping the dog until she wanted it back, at which time she is responsible to pay you back all vet fees, food, and board for the past 8 years up front in a lump sum cash.", "NTA\n\n8 YEARS? Days, or weeks, *maybe*, but YEARS?!? It would be cruel to the dog to give her back, even if it was an amazing home. Pretty sure after that long, even if it WAS a \"misunderstanding\" (which is BS by the way), no court would ever side with her unless she was covering all the dog's expenses and paying you to care for her the entire time....then there might be a question that it was an arrangement. Otherwise, nope, enjoy your pupper and give her a big ol snuggle.", "Like most people said, NTA, your \"friend\" coworker practically gave that dog up for adoption to a foster family which that happened to you, 8 years later now that dog has bonded with you and your family. I say it's a bit too late to bring that dog back to your friend's coworker especially 8 years has pass. If the owner visited the dog daily and walked the dog, helped paid for it's food then I can say the dog should go back to it's original family, but after years went by, that dog bonded with you and she should look for a similar dog and maybe have a play date with your dog.", "I have guardianship for a dog. About a 2 year commitment. Her owner is in the military serving our country. He sends me $60/month to cover food, etc. I love HIS dog to pieces. (He should be able to get housing next year and take her back with him.) I will miss her, but she belongs to HIM, and HE supports her financially. \n\nDid this person send you a monthly stipend to cover expenses? \n\nOf course not. NTA!!! It's now YOUR family's beloved pet.", "NTA\n\nThe previous owner doesn't seem to realize that a pet isn't a mere accessory, like a purse or a pair of shoes, to be discarded and picked back up later. Plus, it's been 8 years!! Chances are good that they'd get the dog, only to realize that she's older now, and abandon her for a younger dog.\n\nMake sure she's chipped and give your pup a hug and a treat.\n\nIf you want to stop her asking, write up a bill with vet appointments, vaccines, food, any grooming and accessories, as well as 8 years worth of boarding, and present it to her.", "NTA. It's YOUR DOG! KEEP THE DOGGIE!\n\nDon't feel bad at all. You saved that pup", "NTA.  Pet sat an animal and realized it had been cruelly kept in a small cage constantly (an animal that needs space to run) and dyed for the owner's entertainment purposes.  That animal came home and was never returned.  Ironically, the owner never complained.  If they did, they would have had a terrible earful.", "Hell no.  After 8 years, it's not a \"loan\" situation.  The dog has been a member of **your** family for 8 years and knows no other home.\n\n**\"The old owner went off saying that** ***she was hers first*****\"**  How old is this owner?  She sounds about 15.", "NTA.  Eight years? There's no way. You're absolutely right. This wasn't a fostering, this wasn't a temporary placement, this wasn't a lost dog. Your co-worker must not really love animals if they think yanking a dog away from a loving family is a good thing.", "NTA. 8 years. This person is delusional.", "8-years?? Really? Your dog, period. \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with these people?\n\nNTA", "NTA, Unless this was a temporary arrangement of a few weeks or a few months, but it has been EIGHT years, which is half if not most of the dog's life. I presume your friend didn't train her, pay her vet bills, pay her grooming bills, bought her good, paid pet insurance etc. If all of those are 'no', I don't know what on earth she is playing at. She may have bought the dog as a puppy but she gave her up, prioritising her baby. Speaking of the baby now child, if your dog is per chance not used to being around children or vice versa, this will create an unnecessary stress for your dog. Your dog, if your capitulate, will think she's done something wrong. You are her family not your friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That dog is part of your family.  Tell the jackass who abandoned her to start with to go pound Sand.  And if she thinks that you were just boarding her for the last 8 years, I'd present her with a boarding invoice for the 2,920 days you kept the dog at $30 a day  Plus I'd present her with every veterinary bill I incurred.  That should put the invoice up around $90,000.  See if she thinks the dog is worth it.", "NTA\n\n\"I want to park my pet as long as it is convenient for me somewhere else, somebody else can pay the vet, but when I'm in the mood I want it back\"", "NTA, NOPE, NOPE, NOPE D o not give this sweet girl back. She is yours and a full family member. Get her chipped if she isn't, and make sure you have a vet that has records for her with your name on them. \nI could not give my dog up under any condition.\nA few years ago, my husband and I rehomed a dog from a friend of a friend. The previous owner had received a job offer that would have her move from a house to an apartment.\nWhile we were talking about the dog, likes and dislikes, the owner happened to mention that this dog had saved her family in a house fire. I was truly at a loss for words. \nAs my husband and I were walking out, I said to him, I would give you up long before I would ever give up a dog that saved my family in a house fire. This dog turned out to be that once in a lifetime dog that was perfect. So sweet, loyal, smart. The day we lost him, I was totally devastated. It was in 2020 during the pandemic and we had to say goodbye in the parking lot. They brought a stretcher out to the parking lot and I lost it. I was hugging him, told him I was so sorry, how much we loved him  and how he was so special and then my husband had to pull me away. I just fell to my knees crying like I have never cried before. It's been 3 years, and I think of him every day. So No, do not return this special girl. She sounds like a once in a lifetime dog, that has stolen everyone's heart.", "NTA. Eight YEARS? I am ready to throw down with this person. I WILL FIGHT THEM. I wouldn\u2019t give back a pet after eight DAYS. They waived their rights to ownership.\n\nDepending on where you live - make sure you have firm proof of ownership. This includes microchip, collar/tag, vet records (if the vet\u2019s records show you as the owner, and you have paid for services, that carries a lot of legal weight), and TONS of photos. I assume you have plenty of the last thing, haha XD \n\nI once found a very friendly tuxedo kitty in my front yard. Took him to the vet to check for a chip. He had a chip, so the vet called the owners. The cat had been missing for TWO YEARS! The owner came to meet up with me and asked if I wanted to \u201ckeep the cat\u201d. I was flabbergasted. How could someone NOT WANT their kitty back after him being missing for two years? I understand that peoples\u2019 lives move on, but if my cat was missing for TEN years and someone found them, I\u2019d be like YES I want my cat back, even if I had ten other cats by then.", "NTA, I see posts like this on here all the time it\u2019s crazy that anyone in this situation would think they were even a tiny bit of an AH. \n\nThat\u2019s psycho behavior, your coworker is feral and absolutely out of her damn mind. \n\nShe got a dog and then got rid of it when she realized it inconvenienced her. Your coworker doesn\u2019t deserve a dog if that\u2019s what she\u2019s going to do over any inconvenience. She\u2019d likely end up dumping it again later down the line anyways, do not give her your dog.", "Nta. They can easily get a new dog.", "It would be cruel to give her up, nothing but cruel. NTA", "NTA obviously. You\u2019ve had that dog for almost a decade. She has no case, not ethically, not legally. It stopped being her dog long ago and frankly she\u2019s out of line even asking.", "NTA, this is not a few months situation. No-one can possibly come after 8 years and expect to get their pet, they have themselves given up?! I would laugh at their audacity.. clearly they don't care about the dogs feelings either.. how could you possibly do it to that animal ?! Poor thing", "Nta 8 years? That\u2019s insane, block and delete and keep an eye on your dog", "NTA - you can't give an animal away and then 8yrs later try and take it back..that's insane!!!", "Lol they want her back after EIGHT YEARS?? That\u2019d be insane if it was only the timeline, but the potential on top of it makes it all the more insane of a request. Absolutely NTA, keep that pup close!", "NTA I could understand 8 minutes or 8 hours to change a mind. However this is 8 years here. The owner gave up the pup years ago and most importantly legally signed ownership over to you.  They have no claim to the dog.", "NTA. You don't pet sit for 8 years. That dog is yours. Former owner doesn't have a leg to stand on. Block her and go on living your happy life with your pup pup :)", "Nta. I saw a similar case on Judy Judy once. The 1st owner lost. There are plenty of other dogs that NEED a home and love. The pup in questions already has a family. The original owner should contact her local rescues and seek out other options.", "NTA - 8 years? She waited 8 years? And now wants the dog back? 1000% NTA OP.  Send her an invoice for how much the dog has cost you, aka the Asshole tax, I would ask for $50,000 in cash.", "NTA.", "Nta, no organization would even be as polite as you have been.  This is not how that works,  and she should be saying thank you instead of whatever she's on about.", "Thank you for this. She\u2019s curled up next to me right now snoring. Funny thing is I have a munchkin and they are so sweet together. But because of the past owner, she was very stand-offish with my baby for the first bit. I think because she was given away right after the past owners kid was born. But they love each other now.", "Agreed. NTA. Show her your 8 years worth of vet and food  bills and ask if she will reimburse you. Guaranteed she will back-off.", "I agree. NTA.", "100% my reaction. Over my dead body.", "Thank you. We\u2019ve moved far and the old owner doesn\u2019t know where we live thank goodness", "Truth! It took us a compilation of weeks to piece it together. She walks with a limp still then wincing every time she saw a belt. I love animals so much and it breaks my heart when I see them hurt or treated like an object. I literally ignore my cat allergy just because I love cats too \ud83d\ude02", "She\u2019s cuddled up next to me right now. We love her so much.", "They never sent a penny. Thank you for this and thank your friend for the service", "That poor pup \ud83e\udd7aI hate people who mistreat animals", "She\u2019s about 30", "Nope nada. We also had to heal a lot of trauma with our dog as well.", "I said goodbye to my little Dark Angel in the parking lot also, way pre-pandemic.  In our case it was at my request.  The lot had little green spaces where we could sit, and she could be outside, with everyone who loved her (including  her partner in crime) and away from the smells and sounds of the veterinary hospital.  When we took her outside in the stretcher, it was the first time in 3 days that she lifted her head on her own as she took in the breeze and the outdoor smells.\n\nMaybe it was a little bit good that your wonderful boy was outside rather than in the vet's offices.\n\nThe memory still makes me cry even though I've \"graduated\" to remembering her life and not her last day.  Peace to you.", "They can, but they shouldn't.  They don't know how to treat a dog.  Untreated fracture?  Fear of belts?  Shied away from a baby?  Nope.  They shouldn't have a dog at all.  In fact, I'm kind of concerned they have a kid.", "Doesn't mean she can't find you.  It's a good idea to make sure that info is up to date.  You have someone who is actively looking to get your dog back.  I wouldn't be too complacent with what this woman is capable of.", "Thank goodness! Keep your furbaby! Nta and thank you for taking the dog in.", "Seriously, she's lucky you didn't report her. I actually had a similar situation with my dog. I got him from a relative and he was terrified of our garden hose. He almost dragged me under the car as soon as he saw it. He would flinch whenever someone raised their hand just to pet him and he made holes in our walls because his anxiety was so bad. I had to sleep with him downstairs every night for over a month. Wouldve let him sleep in my room with me, but he got all upset in smaller rooms with the door closed. Now he's perfectly fine. Doesn't care about the hose and no more flinching.", "You are most welcome and give that fur baby a kiss from me!", "Wow! Your friend lives on another planet if she thinks she can pitch up and demand YOUR dog, on whom you've clearly spent a lot of time, love, and money, all of which are more than her initial payment. She is being selfish and entitled, and should realise she GAVE what was once her dog to you. If she'd wanted her dog and baby under the same roof, she'd have found a way, which leads me to beleive wants the convenience of an already house trained dog without the effort, but not considering how much of an upheaval it will cause, especially owing to past trauma. Personally, I'd be willing to end that friendship.\n\nPs I hope her microchip is registered at your address!", "Yeah ours was similar. It was belts, raising our hands then a little limp walk that she still has all this time later. Vet found a fracture that was never treated so it healed improperly", "I will 100%"]}
