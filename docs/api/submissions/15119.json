My mom wanted her stuff in the cart that she already sanitized. Honest mistake cashier didn\u2019t know. She instantly went into attack mode talking about her condition and all that jazz. The same old song and dance. I looked at the cashier and told him that he\u2019s lucky he doesn\u2019t have to go home with her and my mom lost it even more when the cashier laughed at my comment. \n\nHe told her to have a great day, but she went in on him for not being sensitive about people with disabilities and shit and that\u2019s when I came after my mom telling her that the cashier doesn\u2019t get paid enough to deal with entitled people like her who used their disability to abuse service workers and that she\u2019s a 57 year old woman and she needs to act her age and get over herself. Obviously people were watching the drama but I didn\u2019t care and went to my car. And my mom went straight to my sister who btw doesn\u2019t live with us and told her that I \u201cembarrassed\u201d her in public with my outburst? My sister called and told me that I should\u2019ve taken the situation with a grain of salt as that is to be expected of our mom, but I told her that it must be nice to live her life on her own and do whatever tf she wants and not have to be our mom\u2019s primary caregiver all the time and deal with her shit.

She doesn't get to tell you what to do or how to feel. If she thinks it's no big deal she can take over some tasks with your mom and see how she likes it. Or how she actually deals with it.", "NTA. Being sick/disabled does not entitle anyone to be a raging AH to service workers (or anyone else for that matter). Ever.\n\nShe needed a reality check. You delivered, lol! Society thanks you.", "NTA. Let your mom know that if she continues to bottom feed on cashiers and service people? You won\u2019t be joining her in public anymore. And that she will have to make do on her own. I don\u2019t see one thing you said that\u2019s not true or problematic, honestly. She will behave this way until someone stops her. Sorry it has to be you.", "NTA \n\nHaving any illness that compromises your day to day does not justify dick behavior. Good on you for standing up to your mom.", "NTA however it sounds like your mom is living in fear.  Some of it quite justified.  She needs to learn to channel that fear into a more productive outlet instead of taking it out on others.", "NTA. I'm impressed that you endured it as long as you did without blowing up! Idk if there is any way to get thru to her, but your mom needs help, if she wasn't like this before, she needs to realize that her attitude/behavior is unattractive and pushing people away.", "NTA\n\nIt's easy for your sister to say that, she doesn't experience it AND she's not the worker being abused!\n\nGood in you for calling her out. People who act like this need to be called out, every time. \n\nThis is part of the reason I am NC with my own mother.", "NTA. If you let people like your mom act like that, they become emboldened, and get worse. Shut her shit down.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is an unpleasant person who has an entitlement problem and she's simply using her kidney condition as an excuse to be rude to others. Good on you for calling out her bad behavior. The cashier did nothing wrong. I would've laughed at your comment too if I were the cashier.", "NTA, she acted out in public and embarrassed herself.  You just pointed it out.  This won't fix it, though.  She isn't going to get a sudden epiphany that she's treating people terribly from this.", "NTA and you probably just made that cashier\u2019s day a bit better", "Hey, you were terrific! There's nothing lower than bullying staff and your mother was outrageously out of line. You were right to tell her off.\n\nNTA. You were good telling your sister off as well.\n\nBy the way, there are times when two \"wrongs\" do make a night. But I wouldn't call what you did wrong. Your mother is the one who is wrong.", "NTA \n\nYour mother doesn't have the right to be rude, disrespectful, and entitled to everyone she encounters. She really needed to hear that her behavior is out of control, and it's time for her start being pleasant to those around her. \n\nI think you are getting caregiver burnout.  Is it possible for you to step back and get her to be more independent?  You need to start living your own life.  Being a caregiver is hard work and you need to take care of yourself. \n\nGood luck", "NTA \u2014 Illness is not an excuse for poor attitude.", "NTA: Mom's aggression is unnecessary and a bit abnormal. A reasonable would simply ask.for the accommodation, not become enraged when a cashier failed to read her mind. I suspect Mom knows she's wrong. Your sister is buying into a \"poor Momma\" script.", "nta. you stood up for the worker", "NTA.  Your mom should not be rude to someone who is unfamiliar with transplants.  A kidney transplant usually means anti rejection drugs which means germs are a lot more dangerous.  I know people who have had lung and heart transplants and what they go through is pretty horrible and often leads to kidney failure due to the anti-rejection meds.  You want your mom to act better, make her a sign she can put in her cart with the groceries that says, \"kidney transplant recipient, please be aware to reduce touch/contact with items as I have sanitized them for my ongoing protection.  If you have questions, please ask.\"  Tell her she needs to be proactive, not reactive, that people are not mind readers and so she needs to politely let them know.  They certainly should not have to assume every customer is under transplant guidelines for contact.  You can find ways to make this easier on everyone, the employee, you and her.", "NTA.  I had this happen to me a few times when out with one of my parents. I called them out on it and they were furious with me as well.  To bad,  the 12 year old working the cash register does not make the rules!", "My brother had a kidney transplant, he could get grumpy, but he would never be nasty to a random employee anywhere. He saved the grumpy for family, or just didn't interact until he felt better. Your mom needs to change her attitude or she won't have anyone willing to help her out. NTA", "NTA. Your mom seems to think the rest of the world are mind readers? How was this poor cashier supposed to preemptively know to be worrying about her transplant? And even so, why is it the cashier's job to go to the extra effort of wiping the cart for her, if that's what she wanted?", "NTA.\n\nMy hubby has had a kidney transplant. She needs to be careful but she is taking it too far. Stuff happens and it is up to her to stay safe. Screaming at anyone is not acceptable. \n\nIf she has never been to Aldi than maybe she has a reason to be upset but if this was not her first visit than she knew what would happen. She should have been prepared for the carts to be switched with another wipe ready to go. Better yet wear gloves and throw away after loading the car. It really does not matter though unless she is cleaning every bottle and box going into the cart because her cleaning was overridden by the new items being introduced. \n\nNext time tell her to stay home or have your sister take her.", "I\u2019d point out that it is she who embarrasses you almost every time you go somewhere with her. NTA", "You both sound terrible.\n\nESH, except the cashier.", "YTA. She will be on immunosuppressants for the rest of her life and if she's taking precautions to sanitize the cart it's not unreasonable to ask the cashier to put the items in her cart. You don't know or care enough to understand your moms condition. You say she's a bit much but maybe she's scared for her life and people like you dismiss her all the time. You then put her down and acted like a serious jerk to her. You're such a major AH with no compassion for your own mother", "Yta. The comment to the cashier, especially in front of your mom, was not appropriate. But man, your mama has got to learn to treat others how she'd like to be treated. \nCKD4 is a serious condition, but she seems to not be coping well. I would recommend some counseling and/or look into palliative care. P.S. Freaking out on someone is going to raise her blood pressure, which is probably worse for her than an unsanitized cart.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But she's expecting them to be mind-readers!!!\n\nNTA", "She was like that when she was first diagnosed and I get it because she\u2019s susceptible to getting diseases and I thought it\u2019ll get better when she got a new kidney but it just got worse. Like how can you become more cruel when God has given you a second chance to live? Like someone died so my mom can live", "Yeah it makes me wonder if that\u2019s why she moved out", "There are a lot of services out there to help people with chronic conditions and difficulty with everyday tasks. There are also services that offer respite for the caregivers. Getting burnt out does no one any good. OP should look into getting help.", "True, in a world where you can be anything, be kind", "None of this justifies verbally abusing staff over a simple mistake. The verbal abuse isn't a one off thing, it's apparently been a common thread of behavior.\n\nAlso if you're that terrified of picking up an infection in public, shop somewhere that either delivers or will load it into your car.", "Also have a person with a kidney transplant in my extended family. They take a pile of immunosuppressants. They didn\u2019t leave home for two years during covid. They are one of the nicest people I know, their manners are impeccable, and they somehow manage to communicate their needs without being an asshole.\n\nAll it takes is \u201ccan you please use this cart? It\u2019s sanitized.\u201d No one needs a dramatic recital of your private medical problems.", "It doesn't sound like the mom asked him to use a different cart. She expected him to read her mind.", "Also you seem to forget that covid is still around and killing people like your mom with underlying conditions.", "I'm sorry to hear that, and you are 100% right. I hope that this works out for you both, I hate to use a clich\u00e9 phrase, but sometimes tough love is what is necessary to help someone.", "She's going to be on immunosupressants from getting a new kidney. So I'm guessing it's making her more anxious about it. \n\nI think she needed the reality check, because it doesn't justify her being a jerk to anyone. She could have been polite and used sanitizer, etc.", "You're not wrong, but she's probably pretty freaked out. I was a grumpy bitch about people who wouldn't mask properly. I'm immunocompromised too, I have chilled out some. I just wear my mask, stay home as much as possible and wash my hands a lot.\n\nThat's how Aldi works. I just wipe the handles on both carts or the husband deals with the cart.", "OP comes across as having been dismissive of his mom's health concerns since she's not pie in the sky post transplant. OP might just be exaggerating or taking things the wrong way. Why would getting a kidney turn someone into a c u n tttt? It doesn't make sense unless mom's scared and OP/folks around her don't give a shit about her life threatening condition or dismiss her concerns repeatedly.", "We don't have evidence that she was \"irrational\" until the cashier opted not to use the buggy she asked him to use.", "That's not clear. What is clear is OP being an AH to his mom and \"putting her in her place\" in public. Which is the reason they asked if they were the ah.", "Understood but she doesn\u2019t have to be rude to the cashier who didn\u2019t know nor is it any of his business to know about her condition. He\u2019s a human being too with emotions and needs to be treated with the same respect he has graciously given her.", "OP's mom might also genuinely be that unpleasant to be around. The dismissiveness could be caretaker fatigue, or could be genuine distaste. I would absolutely describe family like that if they're constantly haranguing people to the point that OP felt the need to call her mom out.\n\nI find that it's incredibly rare for a single person to consistently be so victimized that they lash out at multiple unrelated people per day. There's a saying: \n\n\"If you run into an asshole, odds are you met an asshole.\n\nIf you run into assholes constantly, odds are **you're** the asshole.\"", "making comments to the cashier wasn\u2019t helpful it just stuck him in the middle of it and ended up escalating the situation. Frankly if you know your mom has a tendency to get upset at cashiers for doing stuff like what he did and don\u2019t like how she asks them not to do it, what would actually help would be you moving the cart away from where the cashiers will put items in or ask them not to when they start scanning.", "He's a human too but her asking him to use the cart she has isn't a big ask. You jumping in to put her down and make you the cashier hero isn't productive."]}
