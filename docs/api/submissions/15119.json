Idk if there is any way to get thru to her, but your mom needs help, if she wasn't like this before, she needs to realize that her attitude/behavior is unattractive and pushing people away.", "NTA\n\nIt's easy for your sister to say that, she doesn't experience it AND she's not the worker being abused!\n\nGood in you for calling her out. People who act like this need to be called out, every time. \n\nThis is part of the reason I am NC with my own mother.", "NTA. If you let people like your mom act like that, they become emboldened, and get worse. Shut her shit down.", "NTA.\n\nYour mom is an unpleasant person who has an entitlement problem and she's simply using her kidney condition as an excuse to be rude to others. Good on you for calling out her bad behavior. The cashier did nothing wrong. I would've laughed at your comment too if I were the cashier.", "NTA, she acted out in public and embarrassed herself.

Your mother is the one who is wrong.", "NTA \n\nYour mother doesn't have the right to be rude, disrespectful, and entitled to everyone she encounters. She really needed to hear that her behavior is out of control, and it's time for her start being pleasant to those around her. \n\nI think you are getting caregiver burnout.

A kidney transplant usually means anti rejection drugs which means germs are a lot more dangerous.  I know people who have had lung and heart transplants and what they go through is pretty horrible and often leads to kidney failure due to the anti-rejection meds.  You want your mom to act better, make her a sign she can put in her cart with the groceries that says, \"kidney transplant recipient, please be aware to reduce touch/contact with items as I have sanitized them for my ongoing protection.  If you have questions, please ask.\"  Tell her she needs to be proactive, not reactive, that people are not mind readers and so she needs to politely let them know.  They certainly should not have to assume every customer is under transplant guidelines for contact.  You can find ways to make this easier on everyone, the employee, you and her.", "NTA.  I had this happen to me a few times when out with one of my parents. I called them out on it and they were furious with me as well.  To bad,  the 12 year old working the cash register does not make the rules!", "My brother had a kidney transplant, he could get grumpy, but he would never be nasty to a random employee anywhere.

Your mom seems to think the rest of the world are mind readers? How was this poor cashier supposed to preemptively know to be worrying about her transplant? And even so, why is it the cashier's job to go to the extra effort of wiping the cart for her, if that's what she wanted?", "NTA.\n\nMy hubby has had a kidney transplant. She needs to be careful but she is taking it too far. Stuff happens and it is up to her to stay safe. Screaming at anyone is not acceptable. \n\nIf she has never been to Aldi than maybe she has a reason to be upset but if this was not her first visit than she knew what would happen. She should have been prepared for the carts to be switched with another wipe ready to go. Better yet wear gloves and throw away after loading the car. It really does not matter though unless she is cleaning every bottle and box going into the cart because her cleaning was overridden by the new items being introduced. \n\nNext time tell her to stay home or have your sister take her.", "I\u2019d point out that it is she who embarrasses you almost every time you go somewhere with her.

She will be on immunosuppressants for the rest of her life and if she's taking precautions to sanitize the cart it's not unreasonable to ask the cashier to put the items in her cart. You don't know or care enough to understand your moms condition. You say she's a bit much but maybe she's scared for her life and people like you dismiss her all the time. You then put her down and acted like a serious jerk to her. You're such a major AH with no compassion for your own mother", "Yta. The comment to the cashier, especially in front of your mom, was not appropriate. But man, your mama has got to learn to treat others how she'd like to be treated. \nCKD4 is a serious condition, but she seems to not be coping well. I would recommend some counseling and/or look into palliative care. P.S.

I'm immunocompromised too, I have chilled out some. I just wear my mask, stay home as much as possible and wash my hands a lot.\n\nThat's how Aldi works. I just wipe the handles on both carts or the husband deals with the cart.", "OP comes across as having been dismissive of his mom's health concerns since she's not pie in the sky post transplant.

He\u2019s a human being too with emotions and needs to be treated with the same respect he has graciously given her.", "OP's mom might also genuinely be that unpleasant to be around. The dismissiveness could be caretaker fatigue, or could be genuine distaste. I would absolutely describe family like that if they're constantly haranguing people to the point that OP felt the need to call her mom out.\n\nI find that it's incredibly rare for a single person to consistently be so victimized that they lash out at multiple unrelated people per day.

Frankly if you know your mom has a tendency to get upset at cashiers for doing stuff like what he did and don\u2019t like how she asks them not to do it, what would actually help would be you moving the cart away from where the cashiers will put items in or ask them not to when they start scanning.", "He's a human too but her asking him to use the cart she has isn't a big ask. You jumping in to put her down and make you the cashier hero isn't productive.", "I have a suspicion that she may not have been as vicious as you make her out to be, given you are definitely a biased source who dislikes their mom. \n\nThat disclaimer aside, from your retelling, she embarrassed you as much as you embarrassed her. You're right, cashiers don't get paid enough for dealing with customers who lash out over a minor mistake. You were justified to push back against your mom and diffuse what seemed to be an unpleasant situation with a joke. \n\nBut your sister also has a point: it seems your mom has a long-standing pattern of behavior and this isn't new/easily changed. If you don't want to argue every time she's unpleasant and you need to coddle her, you may just need to spend less time with her in public. \n\nNTA.", "NTA- your mom needs to get a caregiver from the state and you need to move out and life your life.\n\nYou sister did the right thing, getting away. It is time for you to as well.", "NAH - if all her issues around protecting herself from infection, then I can see the reasoning. She's had a pretty nasty experience, she almost died, she lived a restricted life and it can all happen again. A major illness even if resolved doesn't just go away - it leaves a pretty massive shadow of fear of coming back. Might be worth considering counselling so she can try and put those shadows to rest. Same with seating down, asking for disabled spaces etc - even with a new kidney, she will still be on meds to stop her rejecting it. Yes, she could be nicer about it but suspect genuine worry behind it.\n\nAll that said, I can get why you are sick of it. My Mum had termainal cancer and was pretty much the same. I remember on late night tube train, she got on, announced to all she had cancer and who was going to give her a seat? Some teens laughed and she asked what the mother would say? She got her seat and I was thankful no one got stabbed. That was her normal practice and it made sense because it conserved limited resources but sometimes you just want to get on with things. \n\nYour sister though is a bit of a AH if leaving you with the daily life but judging you for how you cope with it.", "NTA.
