At issue is whether your conduct was rude - not whether your feelings were correct or your insecurity.  You were invited to a party and you went.  You were the outside compared to his family.  He ghosted you at his party, leaving you adrift with his family.  He made no effort to introduce you to the \"long time friend.\"  You did not embarrass yourself or him - you simply removed yourself form the situation.  Wonder how long it took him to even notice.  He's already dumped you since he doesn't date people like you.  \nTime to move on.  Don't look back.  He's shown you who he is - believe him.  You are not important to him.

It doesn't seem like he really bothered to even introduce the two of you, and I can understand where your emotions were coming from.  The way you handled it wasn't mature at all though, it's your responsibility to communicate your feelings.  Plus it WAS his birthday party and he hadn't seen his friend in literal years, so of course he'd be excited to see her and want to spend time with her.  I do think that your boyfriend jumping to the conclusion that you were mad because you weren't the center of attention wasn't fair to you though.", "Communication is the key to any successful relationship.\nIf you don't talk to him he won't know how you feel. He can't read your mind.\nLeaving like that might have destroyed your relationship. Use this as a lesson for any future relationship.", "I agree that he's not a mind reader, but I have been in a similar position before. It felt weird, and I chose to not be irritated (of course I was sitting and talking to one of the hottest police officers I'd ever met at the time, so easy enough) just to have the officer say it was odd that I didn't get angry at him sneaking off with another girl. I knew he wasn't my forever, so hard to get angry. \n\nIts fair that you felt the way you did,  but you might have been able to express it better. Still,  it was insensitive on his part. He should have wanted you to know someone important to him and made an effort to at least explain who the person was and for you to know them.\n\nSo tentative ESH.", "NAH but definitely insecure and obvi no fun at parties. You may just be incompatible overall.", "Did you at any point let him know you were feeling uncomfortable or ask him who she was and why he was so excited to see her?\n\nYTA.", "ESH. He should\u2019ve introduced you and made you feel included to the conversation. He also should get some time catching up with his friend. You shouldn\u2019t have left without communicating with him. \n\nA discussion on how you felt should have him (if he is reasonable) understanding how you felt. This seems recoverable if both of you apologize.", "Sorry I think YTA you left without even finding out who the girl was or why she was getting so much attention. You should be able to go without being your BF's center of att for a night. I would hope that if you'd asked you would have been OK entertaining yourself or even saying hey I can see you're gonna be busy so I'll cut out early.", "As much as it hurts to be real with ourselves, you are a blip on the radar of his life so far. Sounds like he got caught up and you weren\u2019t secure enough to say something. Yta", "YTA\n\nA person in a mature, healthy relationship communicates with their significant other. You could have joined them at the fire pit; you could have pulled him aside at another point during the evening to express that you felt left out/lost/insecure. You absolutely should have let him know you were leaving and thanked the host.\n\nYou took a perceived slight and multiplied it by ten by not talking to your boyfriend in the moment.", "I'm leaning yta. It's HIS birthday, birthday parties are kind of hectic and a long time friend flying in is an exciting thing and kind of a big deal to some. It wasn't nice he didn't introduce you , but I'd just chalk that up to chaos of the moment  and what sounds like is a new relationship.  You didn't really give enough context tbh , but leaving your partners party without saying bye isn't going to win you any brownie points with him or his family / friends . It just makes you look self centered .", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend spent the day not glued to your side, and instead chose to catch up with an old friend he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.\n\nYou decided to get mad about this and leave.  Really?\n\nGood for him for not dating such self-centered people.", "NTA\n\nHe could have handled that situation ENTIRELY differently. He really mucked it up and disrespected you in the process.", "NTA you would think it would be important to him for his close friend and girlfriend to get to know each other. Him not immediately introducing you to her is suspicious. He wanted to appear single or at least downplay your relationship.", "That's incredibly generous to the BF because at face value it looks like the friend is the one he wants to be with  and his family want her to be the in law too  but as the Dean girl is out of the country he is seeking for OP fur now. \n\nOP was write restrained in leaving and not making a scene by breaking up with him at his birthday.", "Her boyfriend ghosting her at the party and not even introducing her to his friend let alone as his girlfriend is what destroyed the relationship. \n\nNTA OP, you dodged a bullet. Your boyfriend\u2019s behaviour after you left was downright abusive, and I\u2019d be willing to bet that woman was an ex or former crush,  and not just a platonic friend.", "You realize that two people can be different genders and still be really close friends, right?  If I hadn't seen a friend for that long I'd probably behave similarly.  She's a long-time family friend, of COURSE they're all excited to see her.  What you're describing ISN'T face value, it's reading into every single person's intentions and desires.", "An introduction and brief run down like,\"this is so and so, we grew up together\" would have gone a long way. NTA", "He sure was desperate for a reason to dump you for the new girl.", "I feel like I read this exact story a month ago.", "Well then...BYE FELICIA!", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s just a friend, he clearly prioritized her over you. He could just as easily have said \u201cOMG wonderful friend from my past! It\u2019s so good to see you! Come, girlfriend, meet my wonderful friend from the past!\u201d He did not.\n\nWhen someone shows you how they feel about you, believe them.", "I\u2019m sorry to say this but you are the other woman, this is giving me vibes of \u201cthe one that got away\u201d and she is VERY special to him. She\u2019s most likely now moving back and he\u2019s going to try and be with her, hence why he\u2019s breaking things off with you under false pretenses and excuses. Trust your gut, he\u2019s going to try to run back to you when she doesn\u2019t feel the same.", "Nta, girl you're nicer than me. Mans would've gotten a break up text and a subsequent block had it been me.", "Dump his ass. What a fool. NTA", "NTA \n\nIf he gets too bitchy about you leaving, ask him to imagine if its the other way around. Your birthday party, your family and a random guy comes over and you go run up and kiss him on the head, hug him, and proceed to be glued to him all night And didnt even introduce your bf. Lol I can imagine your bf would have a fit of impotent rage if that happened.", "INFO: What is your relationship like with you bc before this incident? Is this type of thing common (where u feel like the other woman)?", "Perhaps you don't date \"people like that\" either. How rude of him not to introduce you. To ignore you and go off with hsi friend. NTA.", "NTA \\~ I love a good Irish walk-off at a party. She had no obligation to stay no matter the circumstances since she was basically alone.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t make an effort to introduce you to this long time lady friend then abandoned you. Not much of a boyfriend.", "girl if he ain't putting you first, you don't need to even care. we ain't no second-hand goods for them to have us around and not care.  cut the thread 8 months ain't that long.\n\nNTA", "NTA he didn\u2019t even make the effort to introduce her to you or you to her. \u2018He doesn\u2019t date people like this,\u2019 good trash took itself out.", "NTA. He shouldn\u2019t be making you feel bad for having feelings. As well as, making you feel uncomfortable and not including you. Kissing her on the head in front of you, big red flag. Sorry that this happened to you.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He told me this was a long time friend who moved out of the country a few years ago and she had flown in for his birthday\n\nAnd which part of that meant he should ignore you and not even introduce you to her?", "Definitely NTA. He called you rude for leaving without saying goodbye\u2026I say he\u2019s even more disrespectful for not even introducing you to her and at least trying to include you in their conversation. He doesn\u2019t sound like a very good BF at all. I think I\u2019d be rethinking this relationship", "YTA seriously? Sounds like a family friend, why not just ask your bf who she was instead of making some snap judgement to be angry and jealous that he was talking to her? \n\nI understand being a bit perturbed but your reaction screams jealousy and insecurity.", "Girl I promptly would have texted \u201c f you bitch, lose my number\u201d and proceed with life because he most definitely got shit alllllllllll the way messed up.", "NTA well it was rude of him to not introduce you to this so called \"long time friend\".", "NTA He could have introduced her to you long before you pushed it.", "NTA\u2026 dump him, he\u2019s the ahole.", "NTA. He was being incredibly rude to you. I\u2019d tell him you don\u2019t date people like that.", "NTA. Tell him perfect because you don\u2019t date people like him and move on with your life.", "NTA and break up if you haven\u2019t already. Clearly you are second choice to him. You deserve better than that. If he cared about you he\u2019d want to introduce you and involve you in some way. But he only cared about her. Clearly that\u2019s where his affection lies. At least you found out now and not years from now. \n\nDon\u2019t worry though he\u2019ll find out soon enough that she doesn\u2019t want him in the same way when she goes back to where she came from and he\u2019ll once again be left alone", "Commenting because I can\u2019t upvote this twice. Nicely said.", "I'd argue that he broke up with OP at the party, he just didn't have the balls to tell her then.  Now he gets to use her leaving the party to DARVO her into being the one \"at fault\" so he can dump her for the old friend without being the bad guy.  OP should just be glad that she only wasted eight months with this fickle prick and find someone who will treat her right.", "Yep", "Yup me too. EXACT same", "Wild how the least crazy responses get the most downvotes on this sub", "Me three\u2026it sounded familiar\u2026"]}
