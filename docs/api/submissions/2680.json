It doesn't seem like he really bothered to even introduce the two of you, and I can understand where your emotions were coming from.  The way you handled it wasn't mature at all though, it's your responsibility to communicate your feelings.  Plus it WAS his birthday party and he hadn't seen his friend in literal years, so of course he'd be excited to see her and want to spend time with her.  I do think that your boyfriend jumping to the conclusion that you were mad because you weren't the center of attention wasn't fair to you though.", "Communication is the key to any successful relationship.\nIf you don't talk to him he won't know how you feel. He can't read your mind.\nLeaving like that might have destroyed your relationship. Use this as a lesson for any future relationship.", "I agree that he's not a mind reader, but I have been in a similar position before. It felt weird, and I chose to not be irritated (of course I was sitting and talking to one of the hottest police officers I'd ever met at the time, so easy enough) just to have the officer say it was odd that I didn't get angry at him sneaking off with another girl. I knew he wasn't my forever, so hard to get angry. \n\nIts fair that you felt the way you did,  but you might have been able to express it better. Still,  it was insensitive on his part. He should have wanted you to know someone important to him and made an effort to at least explain who the person was and for you to know them.\n\nSo tentative ESH.", "NAH but definitely insecure and obvi no fun at parties.

It's HIS birthday, birthday parties are kind of hectic and a long time friend flying in is an exciting thing and kind of a big deal to some. It wasn't nice he didn't introduce you , but I'd just chalk that up to chaos of the moment  and what sounds like is a new relationship.  You didn't really give enough context tbh , but leaving your partners party without saying bye isn't going to win you any brownie points with him or his family / friends . It just makes you look self centered .", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend spent the day not glued to your side, and instead chose to catch up with an old friend he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.\n\nYou decided to get mad about this and leave.

Your boyfriend\u2019s behaviour after you left was downright abusive, and I\u2019d be willing to bet that woman was an ex or former crush,  and not just a platonic friend.", "You realize that two people can be different genders and still be really close friends, right?  If I hadn't seen a friend for that long I'd probably behave similarly.  She's a long-time family friend, of COURSE they're all excited to see her.  What you're describing ISN'T face value, it's reading into every single person's intentions and desires.", "An introduction and brief run down like,\"this is so and so, we grew up together\" would have gone a long way.
