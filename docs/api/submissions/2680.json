At issue is whether your conduct was rude - not whether your feelings were correct or your insecurity.  You were invited to a party and you went.  You were the outside compared to his family.  He ghosted you at his party, leaving you adrift with his family.  He made no effort to introduce you to the \"long time friend.\"  You did not embarrass yourself or him - you simply removed yourself form the situation.  Wonder how long it took him to even notice.  He's already dumped you since he doesn't date people like you.  \nTime to move on.  Don't look back.  He's shown you who he is - believe him.  You are not important to him.  Not even important enough to introduce to his long time friend.", "NTA. He should\u2019ve introduced you\u2026not to mention include you in conversations or AT LEAST check on you throughout the night. Red flag city", "NTA - If he was committed to you, he would have introduced you to this person. Red Flag that he makes you feel like the outsider. Time to find someone else, considering his lack of consideration AND his response.", "NTA. And you shouldn't date anyone who would ignore you when you're at a party.", "NTA. I really wanted to vote N.AH because there\u2019s no necessity for a couple to be joined at the hip at a birthday party, but\u2026  The guy basically ghosted you and then later (I wonder how *much* later) he flipped the narrative that you wanted to be the \u2018center of attention.\u2019 What an a$$.", "NTA \n\nlol your boyfriend is grasping at any excuse to break up so he can hook up with this girl with a clean conscience. As soon as she leaves, he\u2019ll be back wanting to work on the relationship.", "NTA-he didn\u2019t even bother to introduce you? That\u2019s extremely rude and telling. Honestly sounds like he was looking for an excuse to get out of the relationship anyway\u2026good riddance.", "NTA- i wouldn't even break up with him. Just ignore him for eternity. His behavior and his family's behavior was rude.", "Nta it\u2019s not about attention but about being included", "INFO What happened between him being surprised by her and when you left.\n\n>After dinner I noticed I hadn't seen my bf in a while,\n\nSo at least an hour went by and no one told you who to she was?

It doesn't seem like he really bothered to even introduce the two of you, and I can understand where your emotions were coming from.  The way you handled it wasn't mature at all though, it's your responsibility to communicate your feelings.  Plus it WAS his birthday party and he hadn't seen his friend in literal years, so of course he'd be excited to see her and want to spend time with her.  I do think that your boyfriend jumping to the conclusion that you were mad because you weren't the center of attention wasn't fair to you though.", "Communication is the key to any successful relationship.\nIf you don't talk to him he won't know how you feel. He can't read your mind.\nLeaving like that might have destroyed your relationship. Use this as a lesson for any future relationship.", "I agree that he's not a mind reader, but I have been in a similar position before. It felt weird, and I chose to not be irritated (of course I was sitting and talking to one of the hottest police officers I'd ever met at the time, so easy enough) just to have the officer say it was odd that I didn't get angry at him sneaking off with another girl. I knew he wasn't my forever, so hard to get angry. \n\nIts fair that you felt the way you did,  but you might have been able to express it better. Still,  it was insensitive on his part. He should have wanted you to know someone important to him and made an effort to at least explain who the person was and for you to know them.\n\nSo tentative ESH.", "NAH but definitely insecure and obvi no fun at parties. You may just be incompatible overall.", "Did you at any point let him know you were feeling uncomfortable or ask him who she was and why he was so excited to see her?\n\nYTA.", "ESH. He should\u2019ve introduced you and made you feel included to the conversation. He also should get some time catching up with his friend. You shouldn\u2019t have left without communicating with him. \n\nA discussion on how you felt should have him (if he is reasonable) understanding how you felt. This seems recoverable if both of you apologize.", "Sorry I think YTA you left without even finding out who the girl was or why she was getting so much attention. You should be able to go without being your BF's center of att for a night. I would hope that if you'd asked you would have been OK entertaining yourself or even saying hey I can see you're gonna be busy so I'll cut out early.", "As much as it hurts to be real with ourselves, you are a blip on the radar of his life so far. Sounds like he got caught up and you weren\u2019t secure enough to say something. Yta", "YTA\n\nA person in a mature, healthy relationship communicates with their significant other. You could have joined them at the fire pit; you could have pulled him aside at another point during the evening to express that you felt left out/lost/insecure. You absolutely should have let him know you were leaving and thanked the host.\n\nYou took a perceived slight and multiplied it by ten by not talking to your boyfriend in the moment.", "I'm leaning yta. It's HIS birthday, birthday parties are kind of hectic and a long time friend flying in is an exciting thing and kind of a big deal to some. It wasn't nice he didn't introduce you , but I'd just chalk that up to chaos of the moment  and what sounds like is a new relationship.  You didn't really give enough context tbh , but leaving your partners party without saying bye isn't going to win you any brownie points with him or his family / friends . It just makes you look self centered .", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend spent the day not glued to your side, and instead chose to catch up with an old friend he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.\n\nYou decided to get mad about this and leave.  Really?\n\nGood for him for not dating such self-centered people.", "NTA\n\nHe could have handled that situation ENTIRELY differently. He really mucked it up and disrespected you in the process.", "NTA you would think it would be important to him for his close friend and girlfriend to get to know each other. Him not immediately introducing you to her is suspicious. He wanted to appear single or at least downplay your relationship.", "That's incredibly generous to the BF because at face value it looks like the friend is the one he wants to be with  and his family want her to be the in law too  but as the Dean girl is out of the country he is seeking for OP fur now. \n\nOP was write restrained in leaving and not making a scene by breaking up with him at his birthday.", "Her boyfriend ghosting her at the party and not even introducing her to his friend let alone as his girlfriend is what destroyed the relationship. \n\nNTA OP, you dodged a bullet. Your boyfriend\u2019s behaviour after you left was downright abusive, and I\u2019d be willing to bet that woman was an ex or former crush,  and not just a platonic friend.", "You realize that two people can be different genders and still be really close friends, right?  If I hadn't seen a friend for that long I'd probably behave similarly.  She's a long-time family friend, of COURSE they're all excited to see her.  What you're describing ISN'T face value, it's reading into every single person's intentions and desires."]}
