How is her wedding dress your responsibility? she\u2019s expecting handouts but would probably never do the same for you.", "NTA - Leia is being entitled as hell and tried to bulldoze you into paying - and for the most expensive dress too. What a cheek! Good for you for standing your ground and not letting her get away with this crap. Also, tell your brother to put his hand in his own damned pocket. You are not an ATM. \n \nAt this point, if the wedding is even still happening, I'd be considering not going. Mind you it could be a drama fest and as long as you are not in the middle of that it could be good with some popcorn.", "NTA.
