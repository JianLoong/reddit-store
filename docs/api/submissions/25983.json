This incident did him a huge favour.", "Wow, Leia sounds like an immature AH. But you are definitely NTA. Don't let her guilt you into something like that. \n\nYou could offer to contribute some money rather than giving a wedding gift.

The only problem is OP said no and that plan backfired.", "I get the shopping for a dress part.  Lots of women take family members shopping for dresses with them.
