She claims I embarrassed her in front of her boyfriends family and friends by being that \u201cperson\u201d who you don\u2019t go to dinners with. Now before everyone says I\u2019m cheap and that dinners  should be split evenly, I totally agree with it.  Every time I go to Dinners with my friends, the bill is split evenly and thats it its done with.  The reason I refused to \u201cpay evenly\u201d this time is because \n1. The dinner was a buffet style Brazilian steakhouse. Where the price is 45 bucks per person so with taxes and tip lets say 80 tops. Not Bad!  \n2. I gave up drinking for my own personal reason. So I only had a coke. \n3. I didn\u2019t know anyone at the table. These were all her boyfriends people. \n4. They all ordered extra items on the menu and i wasn\u2019t offered any.  Which was also fine cuz I would have paid it. \n5. The biggest issue I had was the money for the drinks.  We are talking about shots, henny shots, tequila shots, double drinks. This doubled the bill.\n\nNow, in my opinion if I didn\u2019t order drinks, and there\u2019s a set price for dinner why am I paying for people I did not even know. An $80 bill became $160!!!!!!!!!!\u2019.  I would pay the $160 if I had drinks. And had at least a little buzz.    I\u2019m not at all cheap I spend 160 on uber eats so the money is not the issue. Its the principle to me. I even suggested to her to tell everybody that orders drinks should start at separate tab. She thought that would\u2019ve been so tacky. I find it tacky that her boyfriend\u2019s family are making other people pay for their good time. While they we\u2019re trying to collect the money from everyone and settle the bill I gave her 100 bucks and left.  I really don\u2019t think I was being unreasonable.

If someone offers and they paid more, fine. But why is it always the person who got less is seen as cheap? Don\u2019t order what you don\u2019t intend to pay for unless that was already agreed to.

It's common to split bills evenly, and just a common for a per-seat at group events. If you're on a special diet, on a budget, or don't drink, whatever the reason - it's perfectly reasonable to request a separate check.\n\nFor myself - a one or two drink person - to subsidise the heavy drinkers at a table of friends pisses me off. They've learned to expect others to cover them, and I refuse. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nSplitting the tab is reasonable if everyone is having roughly the same amount on the bill.  If there's a wild disparity, which usually involves the (overpriced) drink(s) some parties are enjoying, then separate checks are completely reasonable.", "NTA.  \nI would have been more than happy to cover a portion of the birthday girl's drinks & extras but I am not picking up the tab for the bar tab of strangers , especially when they are ordering from the top shelf.", "NTA - Your position is reasonable. Those drinking and ordering extras could/should have stepped up and normalized you requesting a separate bill. If I was them I'd want to enjoy my meal on my  terms and not put others out (pay for my extras).", "NTA. I find it weird though that she's having a birthday dinner but not paying for all... like... what's the point?\n\nEdit: turns out it's different cultures. Good to know now \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. I really hate it when people order everything on the menu and a lot of alcohol, then say \"Let's split the bill!\" They know they are freeloading.", "NTA. Booze is expensive and if you're not partaking, you shouldn't have to pay for it. When my vegetarian friends join a group dinner, we take off all the meat appetizers from their portion because they did not eat any of those. To me its the same thing.", "I don't understand this \"Split the bill\" idea. If it's just 2 people and they agree ahead of time that is fine. But I have NEVER been with a group where this type of paying was ever considered. My wife and I get a separate bill from other couples we may be out with. Or sometimes we or others pick up the tab. But dividing the cost evenly when each persons meal and drinks may be 2 or 3 times as someone else's makes this method completely ridiculous. Everyone pays their own way unless decided ahead of time.", "In what backward ass world would you be expected to pay anything at someone else's birthday party? NTA", "NTA. ALWAYS pay for your own drinks ONLY. This is a rule my friends and I have as well. Food bill is split more or less evenly, for drinks pay on your own. It's the only thing that makes sense. Some people dont drink alcohol, some down 5 beers, some just the 1 cocktail. It's wrong of them to expect you to pay for alcohol you didnt even drink.", "NTA", "NTA. I would have told my friend in advance and just given them cash then to be subtle, but I don\u2019t think you did wrong or should be embarrassed.\n\nMy bestie used to go to dinner and have several drinks, an appetizer or two, her entree, and dessert then split the bill, so I was always paying far more than my share. I didn\u2019t put a stop to it for far too many years.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to subsidize their bill", "NTA- and fuck anyone who says otherwise. It doesn\u2019t make their meals more expensive- it makes the cost more *accurate*. Idk why people get touchy about this, but it is YOUR job to manage YOUR finances, & they shouldn\u2019t have shit to say about it.", "I get it. I don\u2019t drink either and I hate going to these share-the-bill things too, I wind up subsidizing everyone else\u2019s booze. \n\nNTA. For a good friends party I\u2019d bite the bullet though.", "Mostly NTA\n\nYou probably should know the situation beforehand and clear it.\n\nIn general, I'd say split the bill.  I do think it's unreasonable to ask someone to shell out $50-$100 more for dinner when they didn't have the booze.", "I go into birthday dinners knowing that I will pay equal no matter what because I'm chipping in for the whole experience of celebrating the birthday person. But, I see where you're coming from.  NTA because you still paid a little more than just yourself, which presumably contributes to the birthday person's tab as well.", "I think these things should be decided and discussed beforehand. It seems to me a birthday celebration should be split evenly. It doesn't matter who ate what. It's just everyone paying equal for the party. That's how I'd see it. I do not drink alcohol, and I would have just paid an equal share. I'd view it as a party not an individual dinner, since no one else had separate checks. But, again, I'd have clarified it before going. You didn't technically do anything wrong, but you probably came off as cheap and stingey.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In all my years going out with friends, people have always only paid for what they purchased.  We have never just split the bill evenly because no one gets the same exact thing.

Wouldnt have had an issue in splitting evenly if it had just been the food\u2026I was ok with paying a bit more than what I actually ate, but I\u2019m not paying an extra $60-70 for wine I didn\u2019t drink.

I recently met up for brunch with friends. It was for all of us, SO's and kids included, but my SO had to work so it was just me.

All but 2 (a Muslim lady and myself) were \"ladies who lunch\" types who had never worked. We 2 owned our own businesses and worked like dogs. And unlike the rest of the group we had both worked service jobs.\n\nThe group took up 3 tables.\n\nIt was Ramadan. Muslim friend ordered nothing, except after sundown she had a cup of tea and some strawberries.\n\nHalf of the Ladies ordered champagne by the glass because high end California sparkling wine was not good enough. Ordered the most elaborate pastry and sandwich combos.\n\nIt was a fun party and we ended up staying for hours while the tables around us were turned 2x. Ladies repeatedly asked for more tea/hot water, extra cookies, etc. and were quickly accommodated.\n\nThe check comes and i am asked to figure out everyone's share (this was before tip calculating apps were a thing and I happen to be good at arithmetic). I split the food among everyone except Muslim friend; determined costs of champagne vs. CA wine, added a generous tip, and told each of the Ladies their share.\n\nInstant consternation! My share couldn't be that much! (Not ma'am you ordered 3 glasses of $18 wine so it is in fact that much)(this was long enough ago that even in SF the going rate for a call drink was under $10). We should split it evenly! (So Muslim friend is supposed to bankroll your over the top drinking habits?) Why are we leaving a big tip when they barely served us! Etc.\n\nDid manage to wrangle funds from the main offenders, but still not enough for a good tip. Muslim friend and I shared a look and each ponied up $20 for the waitress.\n\n20+ years later I still remember the cheapness of the richest persons at the table.

Older people who are well established financially tend to host/pick up the entire tab. But generally it's rude to invite people so they can pay for you. If friends offer to take you out for your birthday it's one thing. Otherwise if you are old enough to have a job you should cover for yourself. Especially if you pick a nice place, sticking your friends with a huge bill for you is bad form.", "Some parts of the US, perhaps.
