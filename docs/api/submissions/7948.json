Absolutely not.", "NTA I feel. Talking about your mental health including attempts you made on your life is not and will never be \u2018a light joke\u2019. They dished it out but couldn\u2019t take it. \n\nYou deserve better OP", "NTA!!!\n\nYou don\u2019t joke about disabilities and mental health issues, especially about your children?! And the way he made this so called \u201cjoke\u201d was in **very** poor taste.\n\nYou had every right to stand up for yourself.", "NTA, they opened the door, if the wind slaps it closed, well that\u2019s just too bad for the neglectful ones. Glass houses and all that.", "NTA his comment wasn\u2019t funny; it was mean. Your response was spot on. Let me guess, they haven\u2019t exactly accepted responsibility for their abysmal parenting? Times up. They need to own it.", "NTA in any way shape or form, they said something they shouldn't have, you called them out for it and like all arseholes they tried to get away with it by saying \"I'm only joking\".", "NTA, I don't think there is anyway to casually joke around about such a topic. Especially from a parent. Clearly they haven't tried to learn how to be more helpful, since it sounds like they're dismissing what you're going through. I really feel like everyone needs therapy here.", "\u201cI\u2019ve cleaned your wine glasses since I was 5, Jennifer.\u201d\n\n\nOh my god you are amazing, great job shutting them down. Also NTA.

They decided to joke about something they all went through. Now they know you remember everything.\n\nThis reminds me of my mom saying I am crazy while she acts she is not depressed at all.", "I started to say soft Y.T.A., but I've decided NTA. Your parents apparently neglected you, and then make these types of comments? They deserve to get sarcastic comments from you. Still, it's not likely to make you all communicate better.\n\nAre you getting individual therapy? And would your parents do family therapy? Because it sure seems like it would help you all.
