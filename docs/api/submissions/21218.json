And it is gold digger. \n\nYour friend is clear about her expectations out of her partner. Being taking care off and pampered. \n\nShe might not like the negative connotation, however calling it as it is without comment isn\u2019t judging. \n\nBtw nothing wrong with what she is looking for as long as she isn\u2019t faking sentiments to achieve it. There is plenty of people content of this kind of trade. The issues arise when there is manipulation and lies.", "NTA for saying what you said because it's true, harsh but true. But you have to ask yourself, do you care enough about this to ruin your friendship? Because that's all that comments like that are going to do. You're not going to change her so you either accept her for who she is or end the friendship (it's not going to survive anyway if you keep calling her names).", "NTA\n\nSome people like that old tradition of men being providers and women staying at home, I don\u2019t, but whatever. But your friend better be prepared for those old traditional men that spoil her to also treat her like an object because thats the reality of being a spoiled princess.", "Nta, you are just telling her the truth. As a woman I don't know how other women can only be the trophy wife. That must be so boring.", "NTA, usually it stems from the mom, is her mom the same way where she believes everything should be provided for her?", "NTA - you are trying to help your friend be a better person. More young women need friends like you", "NTA.", "NTA\nFriends like this aren\u2019t good friends. Find people who you connect with and leave her behind. If this attitude of hers doesn\u2019t change she\u2019ll lead a sad life", "As long as your friend is upfront with her partners about what she wants/expects I don\u2019t see the problem. Men being \u201cproviders\u201d isn\u2019t a new or weird concept. That\u2019s the traditional standard. If that\u2019s what she wants and she wants to be taken care of that\u2019s fine. I think instead of insulting her and insinuating she\u2019s a gold digger, you could\u2019ve talked to her about how there are men who use finances as a means to control and abuse their partners and rely on a man entirely can be dangerous. \n\nI would say YTA because why would calling your friend a good digger be not asshole behavior", "YTA The correct response was: \u201cThere are plenty of sugar daddies out there. Go and find one.\u201d", "YTA\n\nA few decades ago the \"Men are providers\" mindset was the norm and it doesn't mean that every woman back then was a gold digger!  Your friend has bought into an archaic notion about relationships but that doesn't mean she picked her boyfriend because he was rich and could spoil her unreasonably.", "YTA for that comment, NTA for your meaning.\nThat was a bit harsh comment and you could rather sit her down and talk to her about your consern about her being with guys for free stuff. If you are too harsh she probably will get angry or think your jealous and dont see the reason of your consern", "YTA for name calling. Just let her learn her lesson. In life, I\u2019ve found that people are going to do what they are going to do, and inserting your opinion into it is never taken well. If I were you, I would say \u201cHey, I apologize for calling you a gold digger.\u201d And just leave it at that. She is going to learn the hard way, what a sorry life a gold digger actually has. Men don\u2019t offer to support a woman without lots of strings attached. There is a price to pay for everything in life. She can pay the price in her relationships or she can pay the price by working and supporting herself, but there will always be a price to pay. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve learned this so young. Don\u2019t try to control your friend. Just set a good example for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You called her out for being said gold-digger. \n\nBeing a good friend means not always being popular. \n\nNTA", "NTA.", "If she wants her Bf to provide for her she shouldn\u2019t date a teenager. Lol", "Look you\u2019re both young and I\u2019m guessing she has only just worked out how easy it is to get guys to pay for EVERYTHING especially at that age. So she is flexing her muscles a bit- seeing what she can get. It\u2019s like getting the keys to the candy shop for some girls. Certainly I went through that. But a good friend points out that while it may be easy and fun it\u2019s not necessarily good. It actually makes the person getting all the stuff less happy in the end because their life becomes more transactional- and if they keep it going long enough they will become a gold digger certainly in everybody else\u2019s mind. And the real problem with that is that what they are selling has a finite shelf life. She doesn\u2019t have to go out with a mooch but she should start thinking about guys as people she likes not just atms. \nSo NTA for saying it but if you really want to help your friend you\u2019ll address the root problem- not just thrown nasty words around. Especially if you\u2019d like to keep her as a friend.", "Yeah. I admit I was a jackass calling her that and I\u2019m trying to apologise but I just don\u2019t know how to resolve this type of thing.", "What \"resolution\" do you want? Why does it bother you? If you dislike her and don't want to be her friend, end the friendship. Otherwise, let her live her life. At most, you can tell her you have a different approach to relationships so you're not the best person to give her advice. Just don't come leeching when she gets a rich boyfriend.", "If she wants to talk to you, tell her why you dont want her to be with guys for free stuff. Like how that can fck up her views on how to be loved or that most guys don't want someone that only care for their money. Let her know your intention. Good luck", "I don\u2019t dislike her, I absolutely enjoy the time I spend with her but it\u2019s hard watching a friend of mine turn into something that\u2019s gonna negatively impact the way she views relationships in the future.", "Why do you think it will negatively impact her? Lots of people want wealthy partners and are very happy once they find them.\n\nI think you're being judgemental without any real basis for concern. The stigma you're throwing at her is a lot more harmful than what she's doing. \n\nWhy not just encourage her to find money AND happiness in a supportive way?"]}
