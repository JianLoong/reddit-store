There is plenty of people content of this kind of trade. The issues arise when there is manipulation and lies.", "NTA for saying what you said because it's true, harsh but true. But you have to ask yourself, do you care enough about this to ruin your friendship? Because that's all that comments like that are going to do.

But your friend better be prepared for those old traditional men that spoil her to also treat her like an object because thats the reality of being a spoiled princess.", "Nta, you are just telling her the truth. As a woman I don't know how other women can only be the trophy wife.

I think instead of insulting her and insinuating she\u2019s a gold digger, you could\u2019ve talked to her about how there are men who use finances as a means to control and abuse their partners and rely on a man entirely can be dangerous. \n\nI would say YTA because why would calling your friend a good digger be not asshole behavior", "YTA The correct response was: \u201cThere are plenty of sugar daddies out there.

In life, I\u2019ve found that people are going to do what they are going to do, and inserting your opinion into it is never taken well. If I were you, I would say \u201cHey, I apologize for calling you a gold digger.\u201d And just leave it at that. She is going to learn the hard way, what a sorry life a gold digger actually has. Men don\u2019t offer to support a woman without lots of strings attached. There is a price to pay for everything in life. She can pay the price in her relationships or she can pay the price by working and supporting herself, but there will always be a price to pay. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve learned this so young.

So she is flexing her muscles a bit- seeing what she can get. It\u2019s like getting the keys to the candy shop for some girls. Certainly I went through that. But a good friend points out that while it may be easy and fun it\u2019s not necessarily good. It actually makes the person getting all the stuff less happy in the end because their life becomes more transactional- and if they keep it going long enough they will become a gold digger certainly in everybody else\u2019s mind. And the real problem with that is that what they are selling has a finite shelf life. She doesn\u2019t have to go out with a mooch but she should start thinking about guys as people she likes not just atms. \nSo NTA for saying it but if you really want to help your friend you\u2019ll address the root problem- not just thrown nasty words around.

Insulting someone you claim is your best friend so quickly rather than kindly, gently explaining to her many men won't be into or agree with her standards for a relationship seems pretty shitty to me. I think, in the context of friendship, YTA. \n\nI know I'm probably going to be downvoted, but I don't think it's fair to look down on a girl for having preferences and expectations, even if many would regard those expectations as materialistic. Her preferences are certainly not mine, but I think she has the right to live as she pleases and date how she pleases without being shamed for it.\n\nEdit: Looking into that lifestyle *when she is an adult*, I should specify.", "You are the problem she has set a standard for how she wants to be treated by a partner and you have a problem with it.

Since u r young I can tell you that this mentality is only gonna give you grief the men who tell you they don\u2019t like gold diggers have no gold to dig. Men with money absolutely do not care if they are spending money on you and they actually take pride in taking care of their woman. The men who say otherwise are the ones that will have you work, cook and clean and then lock themselves in the toilet for 45 minutes whilst u deal with everything or ditch you to go to the pub. So yes YTA  don\u2019t let the pick me\u2019s and broke men comments fool you.

You are perfectly entitled to feel that it is weird she has these expectations from her partners, but those are YOUR feelings, not hers. We also don\u2019t know the dynamics of their relationship. Just because you have a problem with her situation, does not make it right to call her a gold digger. Are you correct in your assessment? Perhaps. Was she correct in calling you judgmental? Perhaps. Pretty much, ESH.", "NTA. I wonder if your friend realized that the other side of the \"men should be providers\" coin is that women should be those men's domestic servants. Your friend just wants to exploit males unilaterally and that's very disgusting borderline sociopathic behavior and you were right to call her exactly what she is. Not that she'll listen. Obviously.", "NTA and welcome to adulthood! I\u2019m just sorry to report that you\u2019re the only one of your friend group that got off at this stop.

She got the idea somewhere.", "I think many people would call OP\u2019s friend a gold digger. Although I don\u2019t agree with it, I can see the correlation in that believe. I think the issue is that OP seems to be instilling her values and morals into her friend and judging the situation based on what SHE believes/thinks would be the right thing to do. In reality, most situations are rarely that black and white. The problem arises when we hold a value and assume others must hold the same value as us.", "But yes, just because it\u2019s not for YOU, doesn\u2019t make it wrong for someone else.", "Thought this as well.

If everyone is on the same page, what's the issue? There are certainly men out there that want to have a partner to spoil and pamper and take care of. Of course there a drawbacks, but what set up doesn't.\n\nOP, I see where you're coming from and both of you are very young, so I'm not gonna call you an AH. But I think you would benefit from trying to have a little understanding for your friend. Is she hurting anyone? It doesn't seem like she's asking for outrageously expensive things and as far as you know her bf knows about her expectations. Right now all you're accomplishing is offending your friend and communicating to her that her wants are weird. Of course she's gonna get defensive. Maybe sit down with her, listen to what she actually has to say and then try to accept her preferences or take a step back from the friendship.", "Lmao exactly. I don't get why being a sugar baby is worse than being a sugar daddy. One wants good financial standing, the other something nice to look at?", "Just because she has standards for how she wants to be treated it doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t have her own career or goals going.", "I don\u2019t exactly know either but she\u2019s been telling me  about her wanting to breaking up with her current boyfriend because he doesn\u2019t want to provide for her yet because he\u2019s in university lol", "I brought this up with her as her current boyfriend is only about 20 years old and is currently in university but she didn\u2019t seem to really care? Her boyfriend is actually really nice and cares about her so I just feel bad that he\u2019s gonna be the one suffering from her expectations.", "Great point. I think what OP implied by calling her friend a gold digger is that the friend\u2019s only goal is to be a trophy wife. However, we don\u2019t know what either of their future holds.", "OK, that is ridiculous...she needs a reality check.", "No we don\u2019t know what their future holds but not having standards for how you want to be treated as a woman it\u2019s only gonna cause you to attract 50/50 and bare minimum guys. I also don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with wanting to be taken care of as a wife it does not make her a gold digger and I think op has been indoctrinated with the illusion of 50/50 relationships when in reality you end up doing most of the domestic and financial labour yourself. I myself was brought up with this idiotic views by own mother to just end up suffering from it. I was set up to fail. We are already at a disadvantage as women and men will take the bar as low as hell if they can, they don\u2019t even value your effort anyway you are just a doormat to them. also I don\u2019t think she\u2019s a good friend to her she sounds as dumb as justPearlythings and half of this thread is full of sex trafficker Andrew Tate fans.", "Are you concerned about her prioritizing a wealthy partner or that said partner will take advantage of her?", "We will see in a few years who has a comfortable life and who is slaving for a man asking to pay half the rent whilst also being his mum", "Oh, definitely the taking advantage part. I truly want the best for her and I don\u2019t think her trying to find men that spoil her at first and then eventually become financially dependent to them is a good idea. I never want to see anyone in that type of situation and I truly hope she never finds herself in a relationship like that.", "In that case, I think you need to communicate that after you've apologized. Because all she heard was an attack on the relationship and life she wants for herself. You're concerns are valid and I think she'll be able to see that as long as she knows where you're coming from. Calling her names started this conversation off on the wrong foot, because her knowing and expressing what she wants isn't the problem and her desired dynamic isn't exactly super out there. She just needs to be smart about it and go about it in a way that protects herself.", "Yeah. I apologised like right after I posted this but she hasn\u2019t responded yet. Also it\u2019s definitely my fault for not mentioning it in the original post, but I did bring up that men that are willing to spoil her are definitely going to take advantage of her but she didn\u2019t seem to exactly care and brushed it off.", "Well the potential for her to be taken advantage of is certainly there, but I think telling her there is no way for her to get what she wants without being taken advantage of was a bit less than ideal. Even though that's not what you intended, what she heard was most likely that you think she's stupid for what she wants and that she's too stupid to realize when she's being taken advantage of. It's a cliche, but try to send 'I' messages instead of leading with 'you'. So for example telling her 'I'm worried that men might take advantage of you and this dynamic' and not 'you'll be taken advantage of in this relationship'. That way it doesn't come across as an accusation or attack. I think you'll be able to work this out, she probably needs a couple of days to cool of.", "I'm gonna say NTA.\n\nI see enough threads on here where the OP's husband is some useless asshole who does nothing but game all day and leech off their working wife, and I see no difference between those husbands and your friend. The only real difference is in what they'd want to do with their spouses money.\n\nI mean, if you wanna be a stay at home parent, or spouse, that at least implies a level of work where you're looking after kids and the house. You know, something that makes you a contributing member of a relationship and household. You have to have something other than looks.\n\nFrankly the reason you provide for why you might be the asshole is kind of nonsensical, because all you did was put the descriptor to the behaviour. Your friend wants a man for his money, and is whining because her current boyfriend is disinterested in that kind of relationship. I'm not gonna use the word, because it might be a rules violation, but it's clear she's not looking to mess with any broke dudes.", "NTA and yes,she is a gold digger and it's no difference from prostitution when you think about it.", "You\u2019re NTA, but your friend is.", "NTA and she needs to understand that the kind of men who have gold digger money will have zero interest in wasting it keeping a teenager. Most men who have sugar baby money prefer women who are at least old enough to drink and have the life experience to hold a conversation. Your friend has neither of those things and needs to understand she\u2019s not what those kinds of men will want right now. Also maybe explain to her that sugar babies have a life expectancy of like 5 years before he would get tired and move on to a younger model. It\u2019s important to be educated and have a back up plan for when that happens, and it will happen.", "NTA, and you are partially correct in your comment. More realistically, I'd say men rarely *respect* women who expect this type of relationship. For example, I have a friend named M. M is a surgeon and very good looking. Before he got married, he spent 3-4 years in NYC dating multiple women at once. The majority of his relationships were like this: Fancy meals, trinkets, sex, move on. M wasn't naturally sexist, but I noticed during this time his language towards these women became more and more degrading and transactional. I remember him buying a necklace for a woman at one point and complaining later that week she didn't even give him a decent blowjob after. \n\nYou chose your words poorly, but you are correct that your friend is on a shitty path.", "NTA. She's a gold digger. Call it the way it is. That's not your fault she's too sensitive. And wants to be treated like a baby to get by in life.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nYour friend will be taught a lesson soon enough. That mentality always comes back to bite you in the ass.", "Gold Digger is usually in a symbiotic relationship with sugar daddy/mommy.\n\nBoth get the benefits. \n\nIf this is the type of relationship she wants, meaning transacionary (you take care of me and I provide sex and arm candy, etc) than she needs to sacrifice dating in her age group and for looks (generalization), and also accept her career choice.", "But part of the \"deal\" for the traditional roles where the man provides, the woman would be the one doing all the housework, child-rearing, have home-cooked dinner on the table every evening. Is that what the friend planning to do? If so that's not \"gold-digging\". But if she's thinking sitting on her phone all day and go shopping on her boyfriend's dime that is gold-digging.", "This. This would be a good opportunity to open up a dialogue. Why does your friend feel this way? She may not be able to understand or see the potential negatives and dangers yet. These thoughts and feelings may also not be ones she sticks with forever.\n\nWhen I was OP\u2019s age, I was similar to their friend. I was also insecure, naive, and lost in life. I didn\u2019t have any big aspirations for myself. As a young woman, relying on someone else made sense to me at the time. Coming from a lifetime of being supported by others at that age, it was all I knew, especially if you grow up in a traditional background or culture. What else did I want to do? I didn\u2019t know. \n\nI would encourage OP to try to move forward framing this conversation with their friend in a way that comes from a place of genuine care. You don\u2019t ever want to see your friend find themselves in a situation where they are reliant on someone with no way out, especially if they\u2019re in a situation that could be deemed abusive or unsafe, or with dependents. \n\nYou also want to see your friend reach all their aspirations in life. If this is what she wants, that\u2019s up to her, but she may need to understand that she will not be able to find someone for her now, or for a while. She needs to be able to support herself in the meantime, and also to have a backup plan if these aspirations of hers don\u2019t work out the way she intends. As her friend, you just want to see her succeed. \n\nIf your friend isn\u2019t sure if this is what she wants or what else she could do, you could explore together what you both may want to do in your lives. You\u2019re both young. You\u2019re naturally likely going to change and grow a lot over the next several years. If your friend changes her mind about all this, at any time, you and any partner she has should be supportive of her in what she wants next (within reason, of course). \n\nBest of luck OP.", "I find both equally weird and creepy.", "This is concerning. Yes, she does need a reality check as someone else said, but this could also be the kind of situation where you see someone get into a relationship with a person 10 years older than them, whether through online or other means.\n\nI would just want your friend to be careful and safe, OP.", "Valid. I'm just irked by a lot of people being quick with the \"she's only with him for his money\", but real quiet about old guys being with 20 years olds", "You means a real check from sugar daddy?", "HAHA", "Apologize & do it quickly.  YTA.  Just bc she's acting like a princess doesn't make her a gold digger.  And calling her a gold digger was an AH move.  If you have an issue with her behavior, then call her out on it tactfully.  Your comment was uncalled for.", "You are judgemental, but all humans are.  Humans make judgments all the time about what kinds of people we want as friends, it that a good book, etc.\n\nYour friend has an attitude that she deserves to be pampered and that men must pay for the dates.  To me, that is antiquated.  I am OLD.\n\nI have been married for decades.  While it is nice to be spoiled and pampered occasionally, you should do that in return to your partner.

If a man so much as suggests I pay for anything, I drop him immediately. I don't settle. Keep your standards high until you find a real man, who's ready to pay for you because you're worth it.
