But if I'm being fully honest - I run a household AND a legit pays-all-my-bills small business and I still have down time in the middle of the day. If I didn't have work & just had the house & dogs to take care of I think I'd be done with things to do everyday by noon. \n\n\n\nNow - if you're a stay at home partner & have a chronic illness or something it's a different story. But to me being an able bodied adult not caretaking a kid or an old/sick person who just stays home & does the same chores people with careers do aren't really working that hard. What recognition are they not getting? A parade for cleaning the bathroom? I don't get a parade for owning a profitable business AND cleaning the bathroom, yanno?", "Mhmm, I understand. At the same time, I think that it's a dynamic with more complexity than you might think. \n\nRunning a two person house, making sure everything is clean, making sure all the meals are healthy and nutritious, doing all the groceries and pet work? To me, that could be a full time job. I think the cost of a housekeeper, chef, and pet carer could easily amount to about $40,000 a year if you didn't want to do those tasks yourself. \n\nFrom that perspective, the labor is worth something even if, as you said, most people do that AND have a full time job!"]}
