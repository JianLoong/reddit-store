We decided on a budget of $150 maximum. We also agreed that we\u2019d do at least partial activity/experience gifts. We love spending time together and have been wanting to go out and do more, so we felt that was great. (We also don\u2019t really need more stuff.)\n\nSo\u2026 I got my partner a nice card and wrote a cute message. For physical gifts, I got him some the/and card decks, so we could spark new conversations; and I have a cute raccoon onesie that\u2019s coming in the mail. For experience gift, I got us a couples massage for Feb (earliest we could get in). The massage will be a Christmas/birthday gift because it\u2019s over $150 just by itself.\n\nMy partner got me a cute, very soft shark blanket/onesie. It\u2019s something that is definitely \u201cme\u201d. I\u2019m always cold - so I love being cozy - and I also love silly things. I do really like the onesie, except that there are no hand or foot holes and the legs are a tail so it\u2019s hard to walk in - basically it\u2019s just for laying down doing nothing. From a quick search, this onesie probably cost $30 ($50 *absolute max*).

However am I reading correctly in thinking that 2/3 of the gifts you got him are actually for both of you? Are those things he expressed a desire for? Maybe you need to have a more in depth discussion of gift giving expectations (for example maybe set a minimum spending amount as well as how many things you want to unwrap - would you rather have 3 larger presents or 5 smaller presents? etc).", "NTA\n\nHe agreed to do the physical gifts and activity gifts but in the end just got you a shark tube blanket thing", "NTA\n\nThis one is easy. He agreed to do a thing and then did not do it. Ask him to explain.", "NTA you two need to talk about reasonable expectations", "You both set a maximum, which you broke and he applied.

If he realizes he came up short,  he will either put choosing an activity on you or will rise to the task of finding an activity on his own. \n\nThere's a big opportunity to succeed or fail for him and you should proceed accordingly afterwards.
