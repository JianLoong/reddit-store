You asked him what was wrong with your outfit before he responded about your cleavage and thighs. People use words so quickly... words you cannot take back. You don't like what he said, that's fine but what you don't do is call someone a creep or pervert. He deserves an apology. Wanting to protect your daughter from actual creeps and predators shouldn't be a reason to get insulted in that manner. You keep talking about your brothers and how they can do things shirtless or with minimal clothes and how he doesn't fuss over them the way he does you and the fact is, YOU ARE A WOMAN! Women are more at risk of getting harassed or assaulted. It's the society we live in. It's messed up and unfair but it is what it is so it shouldn't be a surprise that he'd care more about your safety than your brothers'. Calling him those names for being concerned especially after you're the one who asked is wrong beyond belief. You're living in his house, if he feels what you're wearing is too revealing and is concerned about your safety, what should he do? Bite his tongue? What if something does happen as a consequence of that? This is your father ffs! He probably should have approached it differently but YTA extremely for your comment regardless of if they were said in anger or not. Unless your dad is actually a creep or pervert, you never use words like that carelessly.", "I think calling your dad a creepy pervert is a pretty nuclear insult in retaliation to a fairly mild offence.

He can be overprotective, old-fashioned or too conservative, but definitely not a creepy pervert. Why does it sound like he came from a good place and just worried about your safety? America is not a safe place, check many ratings compared to other countries. He probably didn't want you to get attention of the wrong people so that's why he said that. After your way of phrasing it, it must be extremely uncomfortable for your dad as now any look he gives you can be taken the wrong way", "ESH.\n\nLook, you are an adult.  I agree what you are describing - sounds very normal.

He honestly answered the question you asked him. I don\u2019t see anything perverted about it. That\u2019s way harsh what you said to him. I wish my dad had cared that much about me.

Plenty of people run in clothing with barely more coverage than underware, like you seem to want to do. 75% of them are hoping to attract gazes from others. (same with the shirtless guys, but they're generally more physically able to defend themselves)  Doesn't mean those that dress in that manner deserve ill treatment or perverted thoughts, but the sad fact is that they're more likely to get both.

Your dad is just looking out for you.", "YTA, , That was the wrong thing to say. Here's why.\n\nFirst, it's illogical to call him pervy because That is perverts generally don't *condemn* young women wearing revealing attire; they encourage and celebrate it. A pervy dad would say something like, \"Hey sweetie, that's a nice outfit. Why don't you come over here and sit on my lap\". The opposite is happening here, so you owe him an apology for that if nothing else, but that's not the worst thing about what you said.\n\nSecond, because of this flawed thinking, **you** have effectively insinuated that *your own father might actually be harbouring sexual urges towards you*. No wonder he's offended! I would be! How would you feel if your own child suggested you might want to fuck them? No man wants any person to suggest that about his relationship with his daughter, especially not his daughter.\n\nYou got offended.

It\u2019s all the rage right now to say any time someone thinks clothes are revealing that it\u2019s sexual and perverted - it isn\u2019t ok to police what women wear, but calling your dad who is just worried about you a pervert is SO far out of line and is the kind of comment you really only see from keyboard warriors who want to cancel anyone for any possible slight. In the real world there is nuance and nothing is black and white. Sure, sometimes calling someone\u2019s clothes revealing is sexual, but I find it very hard to believe that\u2019s the case here unless there\u2019s a lot you\u2019re leaving out.

My mom just kinda hoped by avoiding talking about things, keeping me from things, that nothing bad would happen to me, but all it did was set me up for failure for when I did run into it, and had no idea what to do. It may be awkward, and not the conversation you really want to have with your kid, but you should want them to have life skills that are important that aren\u2019t taught in schools. Keeping info from kids is just hurting them, and making daughters feel as if they should be ashamed of their cleavage and legs, or feel as if they need to \u201ccover them\u201d for whatever reason, shit like that- that is hurting your kid in more ways than you realize.

Maybe one from the 1950s, but a modern father should know better.  \n\n\nShould OP have called her dad a perv? Absolutely not. While he is very ignorant, and it's a shame he didn't learn how to raise a daughter before his was full grown, his intent was not malicious. OP should apologize, and make an attempt to educate her father about why \"What was she wearing?\" is not an appropriate response to news stories about women getting attacked.", "He was specific because she asked him too be.", "He was not sexualizing her.

I never interpreted them as creepy or slut shaming, more so like maybe pay a lil more attention to my surroundings because unfortunately more exposed skin meant more gross comments & looks. I received vastly less comments/looks when I was bundled up.  Is it fair to women? No, but it's an unfortunate reality and even despite recent publicity & action, societal norms will take much longer to change.

To call him a perv is a little extreme, I can agree, but his concern is rooted in a perversion that he seeks to thwart by trying to control what his daughter wears.
