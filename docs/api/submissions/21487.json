{"id": 21487, "submission_id": "14s84uq", "title": "AITA for saying I don\u2019t want to eat body parts?", "selftext": "\rBackground: \r\n\r\nI (23 f) am with my boyfriend (24 m) for over 3 years now. His parents (mom and stepdad) and I have had our issues in the beginning but after about two years, they seemed to accept me and, even though I won\u2019t forget certain things they have said about or towards me, I felt like it went uphill. Five months ago, I decided to go vegan. My bf has been very supportive all the time (he even eats a lot vegan food now, too) and when we visited his parents, his mom would also prepare something for me to eat. I told her thank you and how much I appreciate that. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never commented their food or started a discussion about being vegan because I know it\u2019s neither the time nor the place to do that. I realize they are not interested in it and I\u2019m just glad that we get along tbh. \r\n\r\nA couple weeks ago, my bf turned 24 and we had a bday-brunch at his parents house (with his sister and BIL). My bf provided the food and his mom, him and I prepared it together at their house. My bf wanted to have everything on the table available in vegan, too. He wanted it not just for me but also for his family to try some if they wanted to. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow, this happened:\r\n\r\nMy bf also put bacon and \u201cvegan bacon\u201d on the table. At this moment, it\u2019s his stepdad, his sister and me at the table when his stepdad loudly comments something about how stupid the idea of \u201cvegan bacon\u201d is and who even needed that nonsense. I didn\u2019t think much of it and responded to him, in the nicest voice I had, that vegan bacon was a great alternative if you like the taste of bacon but don\u2019t like eating body parts. Now he\u2019s furious complaining he hasn\u2019t ever heard such nonsense as meat being called body parts and how stupid that was. Bf\u2019s sister asked if he was fine and why he was so angry.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally ate, I asked bf\u2019s BIL for the egg salad (which was vegan too). So stepdad asked me if I\u2019m now going to eat dead baby animals. I respond that technically there\u2019s no baby unless the egg was fertilized but it wasn\u2019t real eggs anyway. This is when his mom steps in and says everyone should just eat their own food now and leave others alone.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, his parents talked to my bf about it. Stepdad says he\u2019s not happy with how things went and that I was being disrespectful towards him by: calling meat \u201cbody parts\u201d. He argues that, if anything, it\u2019s a cadaver not a body (because it\u2019s an animal and not human).\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think this is ridiculous. I admit I could\u2019ve just ignored him maybe, but I don\u2019t really see why I would sit there and let him talk like that (which in my opinion was disrespectful in the first place). My bf wants me to \u201cfix\u201d the situation. I am ready to do that for his sake, but I honestly don\u2019t think I am the one who owes an apology and I don\u2019t want his parents to think it\u2019s fine. All I think about this and especially his stepdad rn is like\u2026play stupid games, win stupid prices\u2026 but maybe there\u2019s different opinions on this. So, Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: because it came up multiple times- the egg salad was fake! Like the bacon. It did NOT contain real eggs\n\nEDIT 2: native language is German, this happened in German. The original word I used was \u201cLeichenteile\u201d: Leiche = (dead) body; Teile = parts. He said \u201cKadaver\u201d which is the more popular word when speaking of an animal body, but also describes a human body - typically used when it comes to a body (human or animal) that started to rot. \u201cLeiche\u201d and \u201cKadaver\u201d are both per definition words to describe either a dead human or dead animal. They are synonyms.\n\nEDIT 3: I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up like that! Thank you all for your (constructive) feedback. \nI am going to apologize for my wording since it seems to mean that much to him and for the sake of peace. I will also be clear about him disrespecting me (too) because me apologizing for my response doesn\u2019t excuse him at all. Depending on his response, I\u2019ll see what\u2019s next.", "created_utc": 1688647476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14s84uq/aita_for_saying_i_dont_want_to_eat_body_parts/", "score": 6598, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's what many vegans I know do. And in my perception it's done on purpose and to polarize. But then thats what it is. No point to sugarcoat it. It's body parts. And yes animals have bodies.

Look, I\u2019m not vegan, and so long as a vegan isn\u2019t trying to shove their ideology down my throat, then I can be respectful of their choice. You weren\u2019t shoving it down his throat (literally or figuratively), you said nothing until he brought it up and then explained your pov.

My bf has been very supportive all the time (he even eats a lot vegan food now, too) and when we visited his parents, his mom would also prepare something for me to eat. I told her thank you and how much I appreciate that. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never commented their food or started a discussion about being vegan because I know it\u2019s neither the time nor the place to do that. I realize they are not interested in it and I\u2019m just glad that we get along tbh. \r\n\r\nA couple weeks ago, my bf turned 24 and we had a bday-brunch at his parents house (with his sister and BIL). My bf provided the food and his mom, him and I prepared it together at their house. My bf wanted to have everything on the table available in vegan, too. He wanted it not just for me but also for his family to try some if they wanted to. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow, this happened:\r\n\r\nMy bf also put bacon and \u201cvegan bacon\u201d on the table. At this moment, it\u2019s his stepdad, his sister and me at the table when his stepdad loudly comments something about how stupid the idea of \u201cvegan bacon\u201d is and who even needed that nonsense. I didn\u2019t think much of it and responded to him, in the nicest voice I had, that vegan bacon was a great alternative if you like the taste of bacon but don\u2019t like eating body parts. Now he\u2019s furious complaining he hasn\u2019t ever heard such nonsense as meat being called body parts and how stupid that was. Bf\u2019s sister asked if he was fine and why he was so angry.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally ate, I asked bf\u2019s BIL for the egg salad (which was vegan too). So stepdad asked me if I\u2019m now going to eat dead baby animals. I respond that technically there\u2019s no baby unless the egg was fertilized but it wasn\u2019t real eggs anyway. This is when his mom steps in and says everyone should just eat their own food now and leave others alone.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, his parents talked to my bf about it. Stepdad says he\u2019s not happy with how things went and that I was being disrespectful towards him by: calling meat \u201cbody parts\u201d. He argues that, if anything, it\u2019s a cadaver not a body (because it\u2019s an animal and not human).\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think this is ridiculous. I admit I could\u2019ve just ignored him maybe, but I don\u2019t really see why I would sit there and let him talk like that (which in my opinion was disrespectful in the first place). My bf wants me to \u201cfix\u201d the situation. I am ready to do that for his sake, but I honestly don\u2019t think I am the one who owes an apology and I don\u2019t want his parents to think it\u2019s fine. All I think about this and especially his stepdad rn is like\u2026play stupid games, win stupid prices\u2026 but maybe there\u2019s different opinions on this.

That's for EVERYTHING.  Beef, steaks, ribs, roasts...  Only problem is you get the cow all at once and have to store it.  So at least two of us need to over freezer chests to make it happen.\n\nBut my brother also hunted when I was little and we'd have the deer processed and eat it for months.  One was an 11-point buck that he had mounted too.  We all knew we were eating Bucky.\n\nETA:  The cow is a dream because I'm the only one with space for a deep freeze.  One doesn't have the space and the other lives in an apartment.", "My then 4 year old asked the 'where does pork come from?' question. Here we go, I thought and decided not to fudge the issue. 'Well, it's from pigs. You take a pig and kill it. Then you cut it into pieces and cook it. All meat is from killing animals.  So pork is pieces of a dead pig'.  \n'Oh', says 4, thoughtfully. 'Is there any more?'", "We take the kids to the county fair and when they were younger explained the difference between diary and beef cows, and the same concept for chicken. Now my kids tell me how delicious cows look \ud83e\udd23", "I knew a couple of kids who were like, \"we don't eat pork.  Pork is yucky.\"\n\nI said, \"but you eat ham and bacon.\"\n\nTheir reply:  \"that's not pork!\"  That was like 25 years ago now.  I wonder when they finally figured out that it really is pork!", "They have vegan bacon that you can get from the frozen section. It low key looks like the dog bacon lol. You can cook it like normal or pop it in the microwave. It doesn't taste exactly like bacon but it does have a smoky flavor. It's a little pork rinds vibe", "you can just buy it off the shelf now", "Even though I eat meat, I find hilarious how grossed out humans are when they realize meat once came from a living animal. As long as they live in a fantasy land that \"this bacon and chicken wings just CAME HERE OUT OF NOWHERE,\" they are okay with it.", "Honestly, it's better if it remains at least a little difficult. Taking a life shouldn't become too easy and casual, even if it is for food. \n\nAnd yes, I'm another meat eater who has handled the killing part. Not for literally every kind of meat I've ever eaten, but enough.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re German. The words you stated in English have another meaning in German and make it much more clear why he\u2019s weirded out by you. Because the words used are typically used to describe dead people, not dead animals.", "For whatever reason, stepdad is the instigator here. For one, he couldn't leave well enough alone, and came up with this body parts semantic argument as if he believes he is clever. Two, he is dead wrong since the dictionary defines body as:\n\n\\-the physical structure of a person or an **animal**, including the bones, flesh, and organs.\n\nAs someone who is not a vegan, I can still understand the need for meat or animal product substitutes. Substitutes like this can be helpful for those beginner vegans transition their diets. And there are a ton more recipes which integrate the taste and texture of meat, over the number of vegan recipes. So why not allow vegans to expand their food options by using substitutes. As long as they are not in your face about it, what should it matter to you what someone eats. I've seen people eat and offer some really strange food, much weirder than animal substitutes. As long as they are not forcing me to eat it, then I have no problem with them. It sounds like OP was not being preachy, maybe a bit defensive, but stepdad was definitely the aggressor.", "True but for all I know she does now lol", "I think if OP had sat down and unprompted scolded the dad for eating meat and that it was body parts, you'd be right.\n\nBut he threw down a gauntlet and took offence when it was thrown back at him.", "She was standing up for herself in front of people who were openly insulting her for absolutely 0 reason.", "Bruh you\u2019re just like the step dad trying to find something to be mad at. Go find a hobby", "Just pointing out here: she didn't say body parts, she was talking about \"Leichenteile\". Body parts sounds much more harmless than what she said, which translates to pieces of corpses, a word you would almost exclusively read in a police report about finding a murder victim in pieces in a bag in the woods for example.\n\nBody parts could be translated to K\u00f6rperteile, a word that could be used in an anatomy lesson, which would be a lot less confrontational.", "Udderly ridiculous", "My sister once told me a story where my young nephew, at a supermarket, asked her where sausages came from. She told him they were from pigs, and he proceeded to very loudly discuss stabbing pigs to get their meat in a busy supermarket aisle \ud83d\ude02", "> They consider the existence of another lifestyle an attack on their own. \n\nExactly. Yes. This is what the problem is. Thank you for writing that.", "This comment makes me shia about The Beef", "I guarantee 99.9% of them wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference in a blind taste test either. Killing it right before absolutely does not affect the taste on any noticeable level.", ">This reminds me of how people will boil certain shellfish alive because \"the flavor is better.\" Cruelty for the sake of cruelty.\n\nShellfish are boiled alive to reduce food borne illness, they host bacteria that rapidly multiply on necrotic flesh.  But hey, feel free to eat some lobster that's been dead for a while and see how that works out for you.", ">70% of Americans are overweight.\n\nCarbs are a greater contributor to this than meat.  Plenty off fat unhealthy vegetarians out there.", "Ok I was agreeing until you blamed American obesity on meat.  That's laughable at best, meat is eaten all over the world and many of those countries have significantly less obesity than USA.\n\nOur obesity problem is multifaceted, but is far more related to what's in our food and how much of it we eat, rather than...it being meat.", "Environmental reasons, I believe. There are genuine difficulties balancing a true vegetarian (or vegan, even harder) diet with the necessary nutrient intake humans need, especially in some places and on some budgets. But eating fish has a lower carbon footprint than land animals, on average. So people will use pescatarian as a sort of compromise, or as a stepping stone if they don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to jump headfirst into a total diet overhaul, yknow?", "Honestly for me it\u2019s not meat but being very divorced from what goes into the food you eat that is a large part of the issue IMO in the US.", "Well said", "I get this a lot with my chickens, rabbits,\nAnd other livestock. They are stupidly spoiled because if I\u2019m going to eat one, I want to be damn sure it\u2019s had the best possible live first. \n\nI also tell my plants they\u2019re beautiful and sing to them while I garden. Im a little crazy.", "Didn\u2019t you know? All food comes from Walmart (actual answer from a high school student when asked where their food came from).", "I swear to GOD I am going to do something drastic if people don't stop commenting on my food, my body, my doctor appointments, and the way I spend my time.

ETA: Elwood's Organic Dog Meat Company \n\nAnd, Those Who \"hate vegans\" I would ask them what are you doing for the environment?", "Yeah all these \u201cESH\u201d comments are just biased people, since the internet loves shitting on vegans for some reason", "It\u2019s been 50/50 in my experience. Both sides can be very aggressive. Why can\u2019t we just respect people\u2019s food choices?", "As a Buddhist bisexual vegan I feel this so much.  Thank you, friend.", "Thank you for mentioning food deserts and poverty! I am a meat eater who agrees with the idea we could all at least eat a little less of it for our health and the environment, but at this time going vegan is a privilege not everyone has.\n\nAnd carbs definitely contribute more to obesity. I'm cool with people encouraging veganism, but there's no need to push inaccurate facts."]}
