His parents (mom and stepdad) and I have had our issues in the beginning but after about two years, they seemed to accept me and, even though I won\u2019t forget certain things they have said about or towards me, I felt like it went uphill. Five months ago, I decided to go vegan. My bf has been very supportive all the time (he even eats a lot vegan food now, too) and when we visited his parents, his mom would also prepare something for me to eat. I told her thank you and how much I appreciate that. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never commented their food or started a discussion about being vegan because I know it\u2019s neither the time nor the place to do that. I realize they are not interested in it and I\u2019m just glad that we get along tbh. \r\n\r\nA couple weeks ago, my bf turned 24 and we had a bday-brunch at his parents house (with his sister and BIL). My bf provided the food and his mom, him and I prepared it together at their house. My bf wanted to have everything on the table available in vegan, too. He wanted it not just for me but also for his family to try some if they wanted to. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow, this happened:\r\n\r\nMy bf also put bacon and \u201cvegan bacon\u201d on the table. At this moment, it\u2019s his stepdad, his sister and me at the table when his stepdad loudly comments something about how stupid the idea of \u201cvegan bacon\u201d is and who even needed that nonsense. I didn\u2019t think much of it and responded to him, in the nicest voice I had, that vegan bacon was a great alternative if you like the taste of bacon but don\u2019t like eating body parts. Now he\u2019s furious complaining he hasn\u2019t ever heard such nonsense as meat being called body parts and how stupid that was. Bf\u2019s sister asked if he was fine and why he was so angry.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally ate, I asked bf\u2019s BIL for the egg salad (which was vegan too). So stepdad asked me if I\u2019m now going to eat dead baby animals. I respond that technically there\u2019s no baby unless the egg was fertilized but it wasn\u2019t real eggs anyway. This is when his mom steps in and says everyone should just eat their own food now and leave others alone.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, his parents talked to my bf about it. Stepdad says he\u2019s not happy with how things went and that I was being disrespectful towards him by: calling meat \u201cbody parts\u201d. He argues that, if anything, it\u2019s a cadaver not a body (because it\u2019s an animal and not human).\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think this is ridiculous. I admit I could\u2019ve just ignored him maybe, but I don\u2019t really see why I would sit there and let him talk like that (which in my opinion was disrespectful in the first place). My bf wants me to \u201cfix\u201d the situation. I am ready to do that for his sake, but I honestly don\u2019t think I am the one who owes an apology and I don\u2019t want his parents to think it\u2019s fine. All I think about this and especially his stepdad rn is like\u2026play stupid games, win stupid prices\u2026 but maybe there\u2019s different opinions on this.

Dont try to tell me that you didn't mean \"body parts\" in a negative, condescending and judgemental way. It's comments like that that make people think vegans are santimonious.

Certainly not meant as a compliment.", "NTA\n\nI love a good steak. Rare and juicy and I'm in heaven. But vegan food is SO tasty too! Meat is body parts. It is parts of the body of an animal. I don't even care if you were snarky. The step father should have just let it go to begin with. He WANTED a fight, he wanted to wedge between you and your partner. He wanted to be center of attention. He can fuck right off. Now pardon me while I try to figure out what was in that soup I had last week at that vegan place my future BIL took me to....", "I'm not a vegan I want you to know so that you understand my answer better. \n\nWhenever there are commercials on for vegan products like soy burgers or vegan sausage my hubby an avid meat eater would comment similar to your BF step dad. What nonesense that is and why do they need to imitate such products when they don't want to eat meat and then making jokes like I'm not making a fruit salat from ground beef either. \n\nI made it a rule to answer to that \n\n\"Why are you offended at other people food preferences?\"\n\nTo which he responded \"I'm not\"\n\nMe \"But you have this urge to comment on it every single time. You don't like it, you don't eat it. The jokes not getting better only you tell it every time.\"\n\nHim \"Well I just don't get it\"\n\nMe \"Well I don't get how people can eat fried eggplants without throwing up and I don't comment on it\" (my husband loves eggplant)\n\nThat argument would continue a bit but you get the picture. As said I'm not vegan and both my husband and I just love veggies and fruit and lots of stuff that passes as vegan. \n\nHe eventually was tired and stopped commenting on it. But lots of people (in my social circle mostly men) would comment on replacement products. I really figure they feel threatened or tricked? Like you can give them food they like and all of a sudden they're told this is actually vegan. \n\nEating meat is so burnt in our brains that it feels wrong for them to not eat meat? Idk what it is but it was your BF stepdad who started that. You could try to make amends for the sake of family peace but personally I think your BF should step up for you more on this one. \n\nYeah you could've left out the \"body parts\" thing. That's what many vegans I know do. And in my perception it's done on purpose and to polarize. But then thats what it is. No point to sugarcoat it. It's body parts. And yes animals have bodies. If my vegan cousin showed me picture of what gummy bears are made of I just shrugged because I already knew. You find this disgusting, don't eat it then. \n\nBut to pretend they're made of some magic powder or bacon grows on trees is just ridiculous.", "ESH\n\nYou both were wrong.\n\nYou could have risen above and said, no thank, this is my preference.  \n\nIm a vegetarian and just ignore or laugh comments off, maybe say, isn\u2019t it wonderful we can all eat what we prefer. \nI would never say, I don\u2019t eat flesh, no need to escalate. \n\nBut if you see this relationship lasting beyond the next month, an apology would go a long way.

I personally wouldn't care but I have thick skin and don't really get offended by much.  For some, that might seem pretty off putting.  He was a chode that started it and so ESH.", "NTA - but seriously, the number of people who are so triggered by people who are vegan not wanting to eat meat is just ridiculous. Look, I\u2019m not vegan, and so long as a vegan isn\u2019t trying to shove their ideology down my throat, then I can be respectful of their choice. You weren\u2019t shoving it down his throat (literally or figuratively), you said nothing until he brought it up and then explained your pov. Him getting all puffed up and saying you were \u201cdisrespectful\u201d is just nonsense. You didn\u2019t call him a name, you didn\u2019t yell, you didn\u2019t say it was a sin, you just said you don\u2019t want to eat body parts (which is a big unusual in how you express that, but whatever).", "NTA\n\n>I was being disrespectful towards him by: calling meat \u201cbody parts\u201d\n\nYou weren't disrespectful, meat is _literally_ parts of an Animal's body. If he doesn't like facts that's a shame, but you were polite and not rude.\n\n>He argues that, if anything, it\u2019s a cadaver not a body\n\nHe can play the semantics game all he likes - a body is a body, regardless of if it's animal or human and it's _still a body part_.\n\n>Honestly, I think this is ridiculous\n\nIt is. It's absurd and SD needs to just get over himself and take a hint from the room that _everyone_ is fine with this and he's the only one who isn't, not that he even has a reason to be upset in the first place!\n\n>My bf wants me to \u201cfix\u201d the situation\n\nHow? Why? More to the point: why is he not on _your_ side beyond some blind loyalty to his SD?

I'm an avid meat-eater, half my family is in the butcher business, and I dislike preachy vegans as much as anyone.\n\nOP was not being preachy. FIL instigated this entire thing. His comments were unnecessary and rude, especially considering his son's gf of 3 years is a vegan. And I see very little failing on OP's part here. **Meat literally** ***is*** **body parts**, that's not some kind of insult, that is the reality of meat. It's no more an insult than saying someone having a salad is eating plants. \n\nAnyone getting so bent out of shape over that just doesn't like to confront the reality of what they're eating.", "I have to go with NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s clear the stepdad was attempting to be combative and start something out of nothing. If he doesn\u2019t understand why something exists, he can ask or just be quiet. It\u2019s not hard.\n\nAs for calling something body parts, you weren\u2019t even wrong. It is a body part from an animal. That\u2019s not a bad thing. The only reason he responded negatively is because he wanted to be a bully over vegan bacon and expected you to back down and accept it.", "NTA. If people eat body parts, carcasses, cadavers or however you might (correctly) refer to them, they have to stand it being called what it is. Also, not FILs business whether you\u2018d have some vegan bacon or not.", "NTA\n\nIt literally is body parts. That's what meat is. If you hear that as someone who eats meat and flinches at it, think about that. \nIf someone said \"plant parts\" about broccoli no one would bat an eye. Well when you eat meat you are eating animals parts. If you have a negative qualitative response that's on you.", "Calling it body parts is offensive.  It's. A common tactic of vegans to personify meat trying to shame other people into becoming vegans.  That's the offensive part.  You are using childish mantra, like a cult.  It gets people upset.\n\nYou can make your own choices without trying to shame other people's choices.\n\nYTA", "NTA  FIL needs to get over himself.", "When I read the title about body parts, I immediately thought \"human\"?\n\nMy mind goes to dark places though. :-P\n\nIt's sounding like he's squicking over that....

If FIL gets offended over that, guess what?  \nHe's a snowflake. :-)  (Tell him I called him that. :-D )\n\nanimal, human.... We're all animals... sheesh!\n\nYou're right, he was being disrespectful to you.  He was trying to \"get your goat\".\n\nStepdad \\*did\\* win the prize for being stupid. LOL\n\nVerdict: you're NTA OP.", "Sounds like stepdad started this with his unnecessary comments about \"vegan bacon\". It's kind of obvious who the target market is for all the fake meat products - it's people who like the taste of meat, but for whatever reason (ethics, environmentalism, ...) don't want to eat the meat.\n\nYour \"body parts\" comment was an unnecessary escalation in response, and your egg discussion was ridiculous. No vegan would eat eggs, regardless of the status of fertilization, so all you need to say here is \"it's not real egg\".\n\nESH", "NTA. Better to stand up for yourself.\n\n\"So you want me to apologize to your dad? For what, exactly? He was the one talking shit about the inclusion of vegan bacon, which was just a way to talk shit about me being vegan, which clearly bothers him for some dumb reason.

He's just going to be difficult, and I have nothing to apologize for, but I am not going to let him be rude towards me and just take it.  The best thing to do is not eat together for awhile, it will blow over, but I am not apologiz8ng when I wasn't in the wrong. That only reinforces the bad behavior.", "NTA. Meat is literally body parts.

Meat is body parts. You kill an animal, chop up its carcass, cook it, and eat it. If you have a problem with the idea of that, don't eat meat.

How can you stand to live with yourself after having spent decades eating body parts.", "I think there's no questioning the fact you were provoked here: stepdad had an agenda by not simply keeping his opinions about your diet to himself in the first place. I will say though, just in the most general sense (and as someone who also doesn't eat red meat or pork) that calling meat 'body parts' is a little provocative in a setting with meat-eaters also just trying to enjoy their meal. Like yes, it's technically true, but if you phrase it that way you're frankly looking for a fight.\n\nESH and your boyfriend is right: I think it would be mature for you to reach out with BUT with the expectation that the stepfather also apologize for provoking you + souring what should have been a nice meal with family.

This is when his mom steps in and says everyone should just eat their own food now and leave others alone.\r\n\r\nA few days after this, his parents talked to my bf about it. Stepdad says he\u2019s not happy with how things went and that I was being disrespectful towards him by: calling meat \u201cbody parts\u201d. He argues that, if anything, it\u2019s a cadaver not a body (because it\u2019s an animal and not human).\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think this is ridiculous. I admit I could\u2019ve just ignored him maybe, but I don\u2019t really see why I would sit there and let him talk like that (which in my opinion was disrespectful in the first place). My bf wants me to \u201cfix\u201d the situation. I am ready to do that for his sake, but I honestly don\u2019t think I am the one who owes an apology and I don\u2019t want his parents to think it\u2019s fine. All I think about this and especially his stepdad rn is like\u2026play stupid games, win stupid prices\u2026 but maybe there\u2019s different opinions on this.
