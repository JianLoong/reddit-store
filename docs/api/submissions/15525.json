She hated being around us, she never spent much time with out parents, and wasn't close to any of our relatives growing up. She left for college a year early because she was academically gifted and barely showed up for things afterwards. She always said she had work or was busy, which is true because she has a pretty high-end job.\n\nMom was hospitalized due to her heart condition. After a week, Hannah finally showed up, and said she had just found out about the situation. She blamed us all for not calling her. We all sent her messages in social media but she insists she doesn't check any of that 'useless waste of time'. \n\nShe then said she hated not being treated like family by anyone. I had enough and said she shouldn't expect that because she never acted like family and always only cared about herself and nobody else. I then told her about the numerous times where she prioritized herself. My other siblings agreed. She got upset and left, and hasn't called to even check up on mom.\n\nEdit: we tried calling beforehand but as we all knew from experience, she wouldn't pick up or call us back until a week because she is 'in the middle of an important meeting' \n\nMy siblings are all divided on this.

You have a ton of gaps. I also find it odd that you only tried to contact her via social media.", "INFO: Does anyone have her phone number? Why was social media the only attempt to reach her?", "YTA something tells me she was always the odd woman out and it\u2019s no wonder she left home early. You made no attempt to contact her. I have siblings like yours and I\u2019m the Hannah in my family. They like to claim it\u2019s because I never fit in but they never gave me a chance.", "This would make sense if it\u2019s not an emergency but we\u2019ll that\u2019s everyone\u2019s mother. I also don\u2019t think social media is the best place to start to alert a family member of a medical emergency. You call and leave a voicemail just like everyone else and if they don\u2019t pick up that\u2019s not on you. Matter of fact if you don\u2019t care for them much and vice versa why do you have them on social media? \n\nOn the other hand the complaints from her seem unwarranted seeing as how one spicy comment had her out the door without a word since. So not very committed to family. So seems like an ESH to me. Y\u2019all not putting in the effort to alert a family member and they\u2019re not doing anything to fix that image.", "What is wrong with picking up the phone? Who communicates via social media when it involves a parent or family member in the hospital? You are treating her like she isn't family. \n\nYTA", "Had me at \"academically gifted\". Lemme guess, she was praise and y'all were jealous of her and probably were compared to her. Leaving for college was her way out and she kept minimal contact. Your mom had a condition and you sent her a message on social media!!!! Ever heard of phone calls? Even if she's not very involved in the family, she has every right to be updated when something happens to her parents. YTA", "Your mom was hospitalized in an emergency, and instead of *calling* your sister to tell her what was going on, you all just sent her messages on social media platforms she doesn't even use? \n\nYTA.", "The alternative would be to try and draw her in and make her more of a family member, rather than push her away, of course.", "YTA.  My Brother did me in a similar way. I Don't understand why siblings think just because we're blood, You can Disrespect Me, or Insert Yourself into the relationship between me and Any other family member...Grow up, Find GOD... Seriously, you need to Soul Search; IF you BELIEVE...In My Case, Just Because You are my Full Blood Brother doesn't mean You KNOW what went on between Me and Our Mother.....My Bad, he KNEW....I'm NOT going there. I Don't need to relive the torture that has caused me PTSD, MDD and GAD....It's Pathetic how people, more times than not, blame the victim because of their alliance to another family member.

Answer: because you're petty.", "Why didn\u2019t anyone send her a text? Is this even real? OP only has one thread and one comment. And why didn\u2019t anyone else in the family shoot her a text instead of relying purely on social media? Is everyone an influencer so nobody communicates by text or phone calls?", "YTA - I agree there are holes in the back story. There has to be other reasons she separated from the family and I don\u2019t really care. Ultimately you use her phone number to call or text a \u201c911\u201d situation. Social media is stupid - I agree with your sister. This is her mother you are talking about, seems like you were trying to exclude her, IMO.", "Yta", "YTA.  You should've called her.  And on a personal note, I was like her in my 20s and eventually came around and now have a close relationship with my entire family, so don't write her off.", "As someone who feels like your sister there\u2019s bunch of info you left out, I was always treated like my opinion never mattered and treated like child whenever I hung with my family even when i became a adult so I never wanted to hang with my family or have close bond with anyone in my family.", "YTA. There is this thing called a telephone. I know it\u2019s somewhat retro but it\u2019s still the fastest and most efficient way to contact someone /s. Regardless of the nature of your sister\u2019s relationship with family members, her mother was hospitalized, you people thought a note on Facebook Messenger (or similar) was the way to pass that on, and then you browbeat her for being upset.  Y\u2019all suck!", "Is there a reason she \"hated being around you\" when she was growing up and cut contact when she went to college? This sounds like either undiagnosed autism/ADHD with being unable to form a connection with you and escaping into academics or a neurotypical \"gifted child\" pushed too hard by the parents.\n\nEither way, YTA, she showed up as soon as she got the message. If you don't talk to her regularly and don't know the best way to reach her, choosing channels she doesn't check often that's kind of on you.", "ESH.  You should have called her, but I can understand feeling like she doesn't want to be part of the family by her actions.", "YTA - if for no other reason than the fact that you insist on contacting her via social media - which she doesn\u2019t use - and then patting yourselves on the back for \u201ctelling\u201d her and blaming her for not knowing. Try texting, and stop being so petty.", "YTA. The least you could have done is given her a call instead of sending her a message on social media when a family member was in the hospital. I mean really? Out of 4 siblings no one was able to just make a phone call? If she didn\u2019t like being around your family, maybe there is reason for this.", "YTA. I don't use social media either and if someone tried to claim they notified me via that I would be pissed.\n\nBut even outside of that, and if she hadn't been as close as others, it wasn't the time to hash things out. Missing family picnics does not warrant not telling someone their mom is in serious condition in the hospital. You may be right she is a lousy sister and daughter. You may not be... But that wasn't the time and situation to flex on that.", "YTA \n\n>We all sent her messages in social media but she insists she doesn't check any of that 'useless waste of time'. \n\n>Edit: we tried calling beforehand but as we all knew from experience, she wouldn't pick up or call us back until a week because she is 'in the middle of an important meeting' \n\nYou couldn't have left a voicemail or something? If she doesn't answer your calls, then why would you think she'd be more likely to answer a message on social media?", "NTA. You all attempted to contact her using the channels you had available to you. Unless you\u2019re leaving out some major detail about why she left and has been LC ever since. \n\nBut, clearly you, your siblings, (potentially your parents) and she are all hurt by this estrangement. Maybe there is a disconnect here that needs to be explored. If you\u2019re interested in rebuilding a relationship, maybe suggest family therapy between all the siblings to start airing out your grievances and finding a path forward.", "*We all sent her messages in social media*\n\nINFO: Lots of people don't check their social media. Why didn't you call her?\n\nYou called her out on her behaviour and then she left. \n\nShe hasn't called any of you to check up on your mother.\n\nINFO: has she called the hospital directly to check upon your mother?\n\nIf yes : N A H\n\nIf no : N T A as this is proof of her not caring about the family. After all, you called her out, not your mom.", "Crazy how you somehow make it about yourself. Relationship or not, you guys both share the same mother. If anything happens to her.. or any of you guys for that matter.. she has a right to know. \n\nI really want to say YTA, but the fact she just got up and left her sick mother because of a petty little fight is bizarre. You guys both suck. ESH\n\nI hope your mother gets better.", "YTA\n\n I don\u2019t really see how it could be that hard to just shoot her a text or call instead of use social media.  And it\u2019s strange that all of you thought she just\u2026saw the social media message and chose not to come? Or that she didn\u2019t care about your mom being in the hospital? You may not be close but her not caring about your moms health is a pretty extreme assumption to make. \nIt feels a bit like you\u2019re resentful of your sister (possibly justified) and you\u2019re using this situation to punish her (not justified).", "It's a stressful situation for all of you, I understand,but it's still unnecessary mean and hurtful what you said. So I am on the YTA side.\n\nYou said that you called her. Just one time or several times? From my experience people realise that it's not about having a little chit-chat when a person (or a group) often tries to call especially when it's not normal for them.\n\nYou also said \"she hated being around family\". Are you sure of that or just assuming? Just as an example: I am am introvert and I love my family a lot. But I enjoy being by myself a lot and just can relax better like that. Maybe she's the same and doesn't want to appear mean or something.", "I have suspicions about what her version of her relationships with the family would be. Or if she is undiagnosed for something like autism or ADHD. I can't make a judgment without hearing her version of growing up in this family is. Social media is not a way you contact someone for something as important as this.", "YTA because when it comes to emergent matters like that, a phone call or direct text is more appropriate than social media... and I feel there's more to the history of this story. \n\nQuestion... you mention she was gifted.  Oftentimes, especially in females who are gifted, things like autism, Add/ADHD, etc go undiagnosed because they can somewhat mask it.   I wonder if that could play into why she couldn't interact as well with all of you?", "NTA\n\nno, not at all. I have a cousin like that. just let her go live in her pissed off little world and the rest of you carry on and be happy. you were before she showed up and threw a tantrum, you will be when she leaves again.\n\nI hope your mother recovers well.", "YTA, time and place.", "YTA, you have her phone number so you should\u2019ve called then left a voicemail and/or sent a text message if she didn\u2019t pick up.

NTA.", "YTA", "NTA. She has made herself hard to reach and this is the consequences.", "NTA. Her leaving and not checking your mom afterwards shows that you are right. No matter what happens, she must stay with your mom, even if she doesn't talk with you.", "NTA. As someone who had a similar experience earlier in the year where a family member was not told another was sick because she has a history of gossip mongering and not actually being there. \n\nShe made a fuss after finding out post surgery and talked about how much she cared and felt excluded. Has since not visited the sick party at home or called like she said she would, but guess who has been telling everyone about the person's sickness. You all know what she is like and treated her accordingly.", "Hesitant NTA. Your sister, for whatever reason, has made herself hard to reach. Her fault and her not staying for her mother are suspect. However, you and your siblings should have tried harder in this case using all avenues to contact her.", "NTA.
