Matter of fact if you don\u2019t care for them much and vice versa why do you have them on social media? \n\nOn the other hand the complaints from her seem unwarranted seeing as how one spicy comment had her out the door without a word since.

I don't use social media either and if someone tried to claim they notified me via that I would be pissed.\n\nBut even outside of that, and if she hadn't been as close as others, it wasn't the time to hash things out.

When your mom is hospitalized you keep calling, leave a voicemail, maybe call her work to say it\u2019s a family emergency? To me it seems like for some reason as a kid she was the black sheep and growing up she kind of embraced it and took that attitude and turn her back on the family.", " YTA.

They emphasized social media because the sister frequently will not call back for as long as a week later. They used multiple forms of communication to try to get a hold of her. \n\nThis is my own assumption, so it may not be right, but my read is that although they did try to make contact, they didn't put as much effort as they may have with closer family members due to her history of not responding to messages/calls until much later", "I can't believe I had to scroll this far to see someone mention calling her at work. This is one of those times when you do call someone at work about a family emergency.  Especially if you know they are busy and take days to respond to you.
