You KNEW she wouldn\u2019t pickup or call back; but you didn\u2019t leave a message? Or try to get through to her at her office that it\u2019s an emergency?\n\nAnd then you left messages on *social media*? \n\nIf a person is posting often I can see how it may be a quick way to reach them, but I suspect that isn\u2019t the case for your sister. \n\nYou then berate her for choosing herself (and have provided no information on those circumstances so there is no way to judge if your assessment is reasonable or fair) to defend your choice on how to not contact her but say you did. Then all your siblings agreed, ganging up on her.\n\nYou might as well just have told her to fuck off from family forever.\n\nNo wonder she left and or called to check up on her mom.\n\nAnd over what?\n\nFor not being visibly loving or close to everyone else when she was a teenager? It\u2019s possible to feel isolated from your family even if they didn\u2019t do anything wrong - but I do wonder about the family dynamics when she was a teenager from her perspective.", "Yta \nYou didn't leave a voice-mail or text.", "YTA. Call. Leave a message. Send a text. Social media wasn\u2019t the way to reach out.", "YTA! It is not your decision to make on whether or not she deserves to know about a family matter. You are double the A-hole for sending a message through social media.", "NAH. Especially, if you and your siblings did try reaching out to her by phone first with no response.", "YTA. For something as important as an illness in the family, you should call, text, leave a message etc. Repeat as necessary until you get in contact with her. Broadcasting your mother\u2019s illness via social media does not substitute for informing her directly. That this is even a question makes me realize why she tries to have as little contact with you as possible.", "She uh, she sounds like a Capricorn.YTA. We are hard to read.  Maybe she\u2019s never felt properly communicated with. So she\u2019s always felt like an outsider. If I\u2019m wrong, I\u2019m wrong.\n\nEdit: after reading the comments. I don\u2019t feel bad. Yea. They are an ass. fixed my vote.", "You\u2019re a HUGE AH for not calling her the moment your mom was hospitalized.\n\nAnd don\u2019t act like you \u201csent\u201d it on social media.  **You put it up there for other family members.**\n\nYou suck as an oldest. Truly you do.", "YTA. I don\u2019t care if the rest of y\u2019all literally straight up hate your sister or if you have a good reason to. Her mother is hospitalized with a serious issue and the four of you were responsible for letting her know that. \u201cShe never answers the phone\u201d okay and voicemails don\u2019t exist? Texts? Emails? This was lazy and shitty and you know that. \n\nStop demonizing your sister for having different interests, skills, and priorities than the rest of you. You don\u2019t have to be best friends just because you have the same parents and you don\u2019t have to love the way she lives her life. But stop acting like she did something wrong by leaving home and having a career.", "Not enough information\nINFO what has she really done throughout the years? Was it because she is smarter on a different level that she had trouble communicating that?", "YTA .your mom is in the hospital and you really thought that the way you felt about your sister was the most important things . Maybe that's why your siblings agreed upfront and are now divided on it . Look at the bright side bro your sister is there whether it took a week or not .", "YTA you didn\u2019t try hard enough to contact her. I would have called the job if nothing was working. That would have worked.", "NTA\n\nYou contacted her by multiple avenues, but she could not be bothered to check her messages, and then blames you for not making enough of an effort.  What else could you have done?  Sounds like she just wants to blame someone else for her inaction.", "Out of topic. Is it normal to not have any contact with a parent for a week?\n\nWhere I live I'm the odd one who contacts my parents every other day...", "YTA - rats always hate the one that escapes the barrel.", "INFO: Did you only call and send a social media message, or was a text/SMS sent as well?", "Forget the calls, messages etc....someone could have popped by her house and chapped on the door.", "On this info alone NTA, you did try to contact her but she didn't answer.\n\nHowever is it possible that something happened that made her feel like she should distance herself?", "Not one of you thought to CALL your sister when your mother was hospitalized?", "NTA.  You told her the truth.  If she wants to be treated like a member of the family, she needs to act like a member of the family. Leave messages and let it go.", "YTA\n\nLet me be very clear. I have a sister that lives off grid in Montana 40 miles from cell service. She has a landline and her husband has a habit of turning the ringer off. When my Mom wasn\u2019t well and it looked like she didn\u2019t have long I started calling and texting. (They have wifi when they use their generator.) She got back to me. I told her she was lucky, in another hour I was going to call the police and have them deliver the news to her door. \n\nMy mother and sister got to talk before she passed. They got to tell each other how much they loved each other and it meant the world to both of them! **Stop being selfish, it\u2019s not about your sister, it\u2019s about your mother.** You make the effort and do whatever you have to for them to be in contact because it\u2019s good for your mother. If you had to call police and have them go to her door to notify her of your mother\u2019s illness you should have done that. Whatever it takes. All of this and you talk about how you and your siblings feel. You say nothing of your poor mother who is the one suffering! Grow up and get over it. Life is way to short. \n\nTo give you some perspective my mother\u2019s funeral is Tuesday. I\u2019m driving 125 miles one way to pick my sister up at the airport.", "NTA. \n\nYou get out of a relationship what you put in.

It doesn\u2019t mean that she doesn\u2019t care. Also, it\u2019s possible that she prefers to stay away because she is being treated differently based on her lifestyle and position. Next time send her an email. Pretty sure she checks that.", "The edit clearly states they tried calling before using social media.\n\nWhat else should they worry about while caring for sick mom.\n\nAnd why is no one commenting on Hannah not replying multiply calls from siblings.", "They did call. She just never listened to the voice-mail or return the call until a week later. That is 100% on Hannah.", "They called her. She never bothered to answer or listen to the voice-mail. That is on her.  Not them. She waited a week until she returned the call to see why they were all calling!", "This.  My Grandmom was in the hospital and I didn't have my cousin's phone number.  I got it from my aunt so I could group text updates since I was the only one at the hospital at the time.", "OP also said she had no interest in her parents as well. I knew someone who was extremely gifted but had a superior view of himself and felt his entire family was too \"slow\" and not worth his time to know. He left for college and as far as I know never came back. Not saying this is ops sister but it may honestly be all the siblings fault. Not one person I read has put any possible blame on the sister. Also op has made it clear they also called her. And no there is no guarantee she would have checked her voicemail. I go over a week not checking. OP I say still YTA just cause you have not made it clear if you texted or left a voicemail. Hope your mom is doing better", "They had called **before** ( we tried calling beforehand but as we all knew from experience, she wouldn't pick up or call us back until a week because she is 'in the middle of an important meeting').

They may not respond to \"we are all having lunch at Jenny's on Friday, wanna come\" but would respond to \"Mom is in hospital. Pls call \"", "Yeah, everyone besides the sister is TA, for making seemingly only a token, perfunctory effort to try and contact her. Like, \"mom's in the hospital and possibly dying\" is absolutely the time to be blowing up someone's personal phone, calling their secretary at work and leaving a message, everything you can do to try and make sure that they don't just dismiss it.

No wonder she wants nothing to do with them.", "Voicemail and text messages exist", "You don\u2019t send that info through social damn media.", "So, you could have texted her phone. Which you already know and chose not to.\n\nYou all just outed yourselves because you deliberately made minimal effort knowing she might not see it. You basically kept THIS info from her, out of spite to prove a point. Do you really think that's not obvious??\n\nThis only shows everyone that there's likely so much more to this story. \n\n***YTA. Nasty toxic people I hope some day everyone sees how you treat your sister.***", "This is bullshit. If you had really called her you would\u2019ve said so in your post instead of saying you only contacted her via social media.

They\u2019re just saying that would have happened.", "Could also be the fact that there were FIVE CHILDREN. She probably didn\u2019t get in trouble so was overlooked.

They called whelich she not only ignored, but also didn't call back. So they tried SM incase her phone is an excuse.\n\nWhat else do you want people who are worried about a mother to do? Spend energy trying to talk to the person who is ducking calls, find out a polite way of contacting someone who is rudely and irresponsibly ignoring family, or focus on the person needing help, like mother.", "I\u2019m sorry, I meant to say I don\u2019t *care* what you are talking about.", "Xd, \n\nFor a person who says that, you replied 2 times after deciding not to care."]}
