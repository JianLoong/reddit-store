I wouldn't pay a dime except for my share.", "Offer the price of a small bottle like 10-20 for pitch.\n\nIf that\u2019s not good enough stand your ground \n\nNTA", "Nope", "NTA, they didn't tell you they wanted you to pay until after. I would just pay for what a smaller bottle costs cause that's all you drank, and next time, just buy your own bottle to drink or talk to them beforehand. I'm sure they didn't mean to push it on you, but they assumed you'd pay still. Key word being ASSUMED.", "8 shots is more than a third of a typical bottle of tequila which is more expensive than beer to begin with. Depends on how many you guys are but your consumption might be just as much price wise. It might be reasonable to just split the tequila but it\u2019s possible you over-consumed on that because you didn\u2019t drink beer too (depends on how many you guys are).", "NTA.  This kind of thing needs to be discussed before things are bought and consumed.", "NTA\n\nThey didn't tell you beforehand and they ate your food. Seems to me that you are pretty even.", "NTA. If you can afford it, this may be one of those situations where being right is less important than your relationships. But they should have told you ahead what the expectation was and they\u2019d better do it next time.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to fund their alcoholic tendencies.", "Ok, 8 shots is not \"barely\" any alcohol. But I'm ASSUMING you mean they drank MUCH, MUCH more than you did, so you should not split the bill 50/50 with them. That's fair, if it is true. Need more info.", "YTA - thing is how are you gonna do the math to figure out how much you pay to be fair about it? even if you do figure that out without arguing, now you are basically putting the burden on the person who paid upfront to pay for your share. otherwise he would have to go back to each of the other friends and ask for a little bit more money. you should just suck it up this time and pay your share, and next time remember to be upfront about that you are not paying for all the shit they are drinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: if you did absolutely no drinking, it would be a different story", "YTA only if it was decided before you went that everyone was going to pitch in equally.  \nIf they were just buying stuff without consulting you, then you should respectfully offer to pay for a bottle for a generous amount.  \nNow, if your friends raise any questions/concerns, just give them the money they want.  It's not worth the $ to lose friends over a misunderstanding that could have been avoided by just talking about it first.

I always view things like this with this perspective; I\u2019m not paying for the alcohol, I\u2019m paying for the experience. It sounds corny, but the experience of being with your friends while everyone is having fun for the week is what you should really be spending your money on, whether that means buying a bottle of tequila, or groceries, or matching ass tattoos. Money is never worth fighting about with people you care for", "ESH. You all should have set these types of arrangements prior when you agreed to go on spring break together. Simple.", "The price of the alcohol or paying anyone back was never brought up until a week after we left . I bought groceries they ate without asking me. not a problem for me when it comes to eating my food we are all friends.

We are even.\"\n\nYour \"friends\" are assholes for expecting you to subsidize their alcohol consumption. Never do anything with them again, without first ensuring that the way costs will be split has been decided up front.", "Just out of curiosity, what's a handle? It that a bottle? I might be showing my age by asking.\n\nAlso NTA. I think maybe pitching in a fair amount for what you consumed would avoid any issues.", "1.75L bottle"]}
