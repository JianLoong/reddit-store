You're not asking anything unreasonable. Just turn the music down", "This isn't even about the genre of music, it's about the volume he wants to play it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Person driving chooses the tunes. It's a universal rule.", "NTA, driver controls the music. Also he knows exactly what he's doing, classic teenage behaviour, he'll get over it.\n\nI meanwhile have the opposite problem, my dad refuses to stop blaring heavy metal in the car. No solution in 35+ years so far...", "NTA. I love heavy metal music. I love my music loud. I \\*respect\\* that my wife and children do not. I do not blast my music in the car with them, unless I'm messing with them. Its far too simple to be respectful and kind and not purposely do things that others dislike, even if you're passionate about them. You've talked to him repeatedly and set out expectations. If he wants to disrespect you like that, then there will be consequences.", "NTA\n\nIn the future he need to find a different way to school if you can hear his music.", "NTA. At first I thought you threw your son out of the car and let him walk just because you don't like the music he listens to, but after reading that's clearly not the case. Your son disrespects the boundaries you put up despite clearly voicing your discomfort and you even gave him money for a cab so he didn't have to walk or miss school. It is very insensitive of him to not just turn down the music or listen with headphones if it literally causes you pain.", "NTA, but I don't get how this is not solved by changing the station and turning down the volume? Is he carrying the boombox? Are you in the backseat? I mean...I really don't get how you can't decide the music yourself.   \nRegardless, NTA bc you have been upfront about the problem, provided a solution that works for you both and those weren't respected. I'd have made him walk to school if I couldn't just change the damn radio, which for real, I cannot understand.", "NTA.\n\nBy disrespecting your rule, he\u2018s endangering both of you. He needs to grow the fuck up.", "Considering all the factors, I think you're NTA. It seems like you're suffering but have still given him lots of reasonable alternatives to be able to listen to his music. I think he's being insanely entitled and inconsiderate. I think you've taught him a valuable lesson about respecting others, esp when they bend over backwards to accommodate him.", "NTA but you need to figure out how to teach him not to be an asshole. Enjoying your music yourself is one thing, but imposing it on others is not cool.", "You established a boundary, he repeatedly ignored it. You've been accommodating him plenty, especially putting up with it to the point where it's impacting your work life, and he's refused to even once give you that consideration in this situation. It's better he learns in this way that ignoring people's boundaries is not gonna be good for him than down the road when it's over something more serious.\n\nNTA", "NTA we all know the driver picks the music! But yeah it could be any music at that volume and it would be a pain in the ass.", "NTA - Simple RULE - My Car, My Music.  When he gets his own, he can play whatever and however loud he wants.  BUT, he is in your car now.", "I\u2019m a metal head, I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s not using the headphones?? Good quality headphones take metal music and really enhance it\u2026 certainly better than most speaker systems on computers and in cars. And he can blast it without blasting you too.\n\nNTA, but I\u2019m stumped. You gave him an option and he\u2019s not using it.", "NTA I would not allow anyone to listen to any music that loud in my car. I would give him a choice such as silence, news radio, or whatever you can tolerate.", "Lol... kicked your son out of the car.", "NTA at all! I\u2019m a heavy music fan and what your son does is not cool. When I was growing up, I always wore headphones whenever I was in the car with my parental unit so they didn\u2019t get a headache and could listen to the soft rock station. I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s being a pain.", "NTA maybe next time he'll wear his headphones/ear buds", "NTA. Kids almost 18, needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around what he wants and if your side is not an embellishment or hiding things to reveal that you're secretly a huge jerk then the kid needs to learn.\n\nThe funny thing is that in his head he likely flipped it around how much it inconvenienced him having to take a taxi. Emo/goth/scene typically think that way.", "I didn't expect this, but NTA. You communicated multiple times and provided alternatives", "Esh\n\nOr... you can be an adult, and put your foot down and change the station or lower the volume. You can not let him pick the music. You instead dropped him on the side of the road with a couple bucks. Has he ever called a cab before, does he have uber (or something like that) on his phone, does he even have a card to pay for an uber? If the dishes in the sink are good responsibility, then put your foot down, be a parent, and teach him about consequences. You sound like a horribly irresponsible parent. \n\nHe's an ass because the rule of riding shotgun is that you put things on that everyone in the car (especially driver) enjoy, not just what you wanna hear.", "NTA. My teens like to listen to stuff at volumes generally only heard (and felt) when picnicking next to jumbo jets taking off. If it's loud enough that I can hear their stuff through closed doors I flip the breaker switch and *voila* ! No electricity, no noise! Only had to do that once. And in the car? It's my car. I pick the music and volume. They have headphones if they want to listen to something else.", "Gonna say NTA. I'm alt too, I love to blast hard, heavy, alt music in my car. However, I don't in my parents car, they play whatever they want, I pop in earbuds if it's a long drive. If I'm driving, I play my music, but not so loud that it annoys the other person. It's really not that hard, he has headphones he can listen to his music with\n\nMaybe slight E S H for giving him no warning to arrange for a friend to take him or something, but given that you even gave him money for an uber or something idk if you're that bad", "NTA", "NTA the driver can override music choice.", "You both are the asshole here.\n\nLook, I get it. I get severe migraines and I wanted to do the same in the past. But you don't throw your kid out of the car. That makes you an asshole.\n\nIts your car, you could have just switched it off. Or take measures later at home.\n\nHe should have been more considerate. That makes him an asshole too.\n\nSo both are in the wrong here for me. \n\nJust my 2 cents.", "Yes, YTA. You went from 0 to 100 with no warning whatsoever. Tell your son\u2014in no uncertain terms\u2014do not turn his music on while you're in the car. Tell him that you're the driver and you're going to control the music, which will be your music at a normal level. If he starts disobeying, *then* you can start imposing the consequence(s) of kicking him out of the car. But you didn't even give him a chance here. I'm not surprised he's not speaking to you. I wouldn't either.", "Soft yta. You had a resentment prior to getting in the car, didn\u2019t communicate and so you tossed him. \n\nShould have addressed the issue when it came up.", "NTA, but I don't understand how hard it is to not let me control the stereo. Like just disconnect his phone from the Bluetooth, don't give him the aux cord or however the music connects...", "NTA. Your house your car, your rules", "YTA I can understand your frustration with the music (I have sensitive ears.) But I feel there was a better way to handle that situation. Either by taking his phone away or turning the speakers off.", "YTA.  You overreacted and I think you already suspect this.  There were alternatives other than kicking your teenage son out of the car.", "INFO- In the car was he listening on the headphones or car stereo?", "NTA - playing any music on full blast when the other person  hasn\u2019t agreed is a major asshole move", "I'm gonna go with not really an asshole but you could've handled it better. But ultimately the driver gets to decide the music in my opinion. If he wants to listen to it you gave him a way to still do so where it doesn't bother you, the driver. If you hadn't done that I'd say yeah you are, but since you did and repeatedly told him you don't like it, he fucked around and found out. So no, NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Do you often ask him to do things without explaining the reasoning behind what you ask?

You are a loving, reasonable parent who drew a line and held him to it.  If he were an adult roommate, would you put up with half as much of this as you have?
