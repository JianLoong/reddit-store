Additionally, I strongly feel wedding party members should just about always get a plus one. There is very rare exception to this.

We specifically included a line in our invitations that the only gift to us should be that of their presence on our big day. Our people literally just had to show up - which is how it should be.

I will enjoy myself far more just being a guest at your wedding. \n\nJust the time commitment is insane for these kind of things let alone the money. \n\nIts also really weird to me that you are being asked to pay for your meal.

The only expenses IMHO you should ever incur as a bridesmaid is your accommodation in, and travel to, wherever the wedding is (like any other guest).

As an idea the minimum wage is around 400 euros, but at weddings most people give 300 euros as a gift (per couple), they take this very seriously and even make lists of who has to come to whose wedding. The idea is that I'm going to x's wedding so he can come to my wedding.

You're there to support the couple in their marriage, not to eat and drink on their dime.", "It\u2019s not admission - wedding gifts are given in cash, and people used a guess-timation of the costs of meal (plus alcohol) to figure out how much to give.", "I'm from MA as well and I can say that no one I know believes this, nor would anyone I know do this.", "Canada, but I am French-Canadian.", "Poland. In here, giving an envelope together with a small gift(flowers, lotery coupons, books, or wine) is the norm.", "Unbelievable!", "That's how it should be. I'm in the US, but where I'm from, a guest is a guest and doesn't pay for anything but a gift.", "This! I\u2019m from the UK also and I\u2019ve never been asked to pay for anything related to being a bridesmaid. It baffles me", "Both. I'm from NJ, and its customary, both geographically and culturally, you give money, and enough to cover your plate, as your wedding gift.\n\nI personally think its tacky; that is the expectation that every guest will do this. Not giving money. But that if you don't give enough then you're rude or cheap.", "Cultural, but modern couples anywhere will usually be just as appreciative of regular gifts instead of cash/checks/gold. Still, that might be why OP's mom is suggesting it. I think African couples have wedding customs that involve actual cash but I'm not very familiar with those traditions.", "Cash gifts are incredibly common in the US as well.  There's usually a gift registry but many people ignore it and give cash instead.  Every wedding I've been to (mostly in the Midwest, only one for someone South Asian) has been this way.  Mostly cards with a check/cash, and a few gifts from people who'd rather give something concrete.", "50\u20ac is reasonable, as long as you don't also expect an extravagent gift. $150, as well as a gift is taking the piss.", "There's nothing inherently wrong with giving money as a gift, but the \"pay for your plate\" expectation is hugely offensive.\n\nAs Miss Manners would say, a gift is something that should be freely given. It shouldn't be expected as a tit-for-tat in exchange for a plate of warmed over prime rib.", "This is so interesting to me. I\u2019ve lived exclusively on the East Coast and every wedding I\u2019ve ever heard of or been to has involved people giving money as gifts. They give gifts from the registry at the bridal/wedding shower so like home items and such then at the wedding itself, many people give cash or checks. My husband and I got married during Covid so we had a very small wedding but everyone there and everyone who knew we were getting married gave us cash gifts. My best friend just got married in the spring and she also got cash from nearly everyone", "OMFG gender reveals, I just cannot.", "Congrats, you're an extreme outlier! It's typical to give gifts at weddings.", "What\u2019s a \u201ccash wedding\u201d? I\u2019ve only ever heard of a cash bar", "Exactly. Invite less people, have cheaper food, something. I\u2019ve been to weddings with full individually plated nice meals, I\u2019ve also been to weddings that catered chick-fil-a. There are so many options that don\u2019t require asking guests to pay to attend.", "And that\u2019s the minimum apparently! \u201c*at least* $150 to cover the cost of my plate at the wedding.\u201d It\u2019s gotta be some insane gourmet catering multi-course deal or something for that price point.", "Bridesmaids should never be expected to give gifts. They put in countless hours of unpaid labor and spend a significant amount of their money to do this. That\u2019s the gift. Expecting a shower gift or a wedding gift on top of that is selfish and absurd.", "That should be cash/check OR registry gift though, not extra cash after your gift.", "I've never heard of this \"tradition\" especially the wedding party who's forking over big bucks to be in the wedding.", "That \"tradition\" doesn't go back very far, at least in the US.  I got married in the 1980s, and there was no hint of such a thing.", "You have to expect to be in the red on a wedding. You don't expect guests to cover your costs. If you can't afford to go in the red by $150 a head, then you need to budget appropriately for your wedding.", "If you have to \"offset\" your expenses by charging your guests an admission fee, maybe don't have such an expensive wedding.", "Best to ask the bride and groom what gift expectations are?? That\u2019s asinine. Did I slip into an alternate universe where people just get to obligate you to spending your own money however they see fit?", "No. You give what you can/want to give based on your relationship to the couple and your own financial circumstances. You're attending a wedding you were invited to, not buying a ticket to a church potluck.", "Exactly!  I don't mind giving (or receiving) money as a gift, but the 'pay for your plate' expectation is horrible.  \n\nThe idea of shower/wedding gifts was to help a young couple starting out in life.   Nowadays, they are often living together, or are older and already have everything (or nearly) they need, and who needs 5 toasters and 8 blenders, anyway?   But....in that case, I'd give a gift like a year's membership to Netflix, or another streaming service.  Take your pick, there are tons to choose from.  Even as I get older, I think about non-tangibles as gifts now.", "I also live on the east coast and I\u2019ve never once given money as a wedding gift, always a gift from the registry", "I think that means asking for cash gifts instead of items as gifts. Its much more common outside of America, in fact I've spoken to non-Americans who find it weird to give an item as a wedding gift instead of just cash/check.", "A lot of couples opt to asking for cash gifts.", "I attended a wedding where we were asked our meal preferences on the response card (meat, chicken, fish, vegetarian).  At the reception, we were all given McDonalds happy meals with the preferred burger, McNuggets, filet o fish or salad.  We even got the toy!\n\nThese friends had a tight budget and planned accordingly.  They\u2019re super fun goofballs so this was perfect.  Decorum schmecorum\u2026the theme of the day were \u201cLet everyone be happy and silly!\u201d", "I agree bridal party expectations are very high. I'm covering enough that my bridal party will end up spending no more than my normal guests. However, it's traditionally expected that a bridesmaid will attend both the bridal shower and the wedding and give gifts at both.", "I've definitely heard of this though to me it sounds so cold and calculating.", "Oh yeah, it definitely doesn't apply to the wedding party, no. Just regular guests.", "Exactly. Budget appropriately for your wedding before asking guests to cover the costs.", "Like I said, different customs have different expectations.  European, Latin and a lot of Asian cultures expect you to give money. In general if you choose to attend a wedding, a gift is traditionally expected and if you don\u2019t want to give a gift or don\u2019t agree with the type of gift being asked  then don\u2019t attend the wedding.", "But a \u201ccash gift\u201d is still a gift, it\u2019s not payment for a meal, like how at a \u201ccash bar,\u201d you have to pay for your own drinks. \n\nI\u2019ve seen people request \u201ccash only\u201d as gifts, but then they usually don\u2019t have gift registries too. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid in over 20 weddings. I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid for $500 (dress, hair, gift, transportation, bachelorette party, etc) and I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid for $3,000. \n\nTo be perfectly honest\u2026 I enjoyed the weddings where the brides cared more about who was with them then what they were being gifted (ie the \u201ccheaper\u201d gigs were way more fun.) \n\nOne wedding I legit was in the hospital for three days the week of the wedding and didn\u2019t give get a gift due to paying medical costs. I wrote a nice greeting card. The bride was just happy I could still show up and didn\u2019t have an IV in still. \n\nOP, if your bride friend is truly your friend, I\u2019d opt for a nice greeting card that you write something sentimental in. If you are giving a speech at the wedding, print off the speech and back it with pretty paper and gift that. You don\u2019t need to give more monetarily. Your presence and what you\u2019ve is enough monetarily.", "I honestly do not care about tradition, because it\u2019s also not traditionally expected that planning/attending these events will cost thousands of dollars, a week+ of time off work, and 100+ hours of labor, on top of the ever growing cost of dresses, hair, makeup, etc. Brides/Grooms can expect a gift from wedding party members (and should be happy with whatever that wedding party member can afford), if they have an in-town wedding, a one night bachelor/bachelorette that is in-town and budget conscious, and have the potluck, friend\u2019s living room/ condo party room/ cheap fire hall rental and handmaid decoration style bridal showers that were more or less the standard 20-30 years ago. Even then, I don\u2019t think couple should expect gifts from guests; especially if they have a formal dress code and/or guests are paying for any combo of travel, lodging, and childcare. Going to a wedding even an hour away now costs at least $700 before gift. That\u2019s a lot. People who do it are doing it because they love you enough to sacrifice that time and money to get to celebrate with you. Invite the people you want to celebrate with, and consider any gift a bonus.", "What in the money grubbing heck is a wedding shower?\nWhat's wrong with getting a round or 2 at the hen party?", "\u201cChoose to attend a wedding\u201d. You\u2019re *invited*.", "To me, it's the same and that's how I read OP's post.\n\nEDIT: I didn't see the registry mentioned in the original post. I wouldn't give a gift and cash. DELETE", "The bridal shower is gifts for the bride and is usually attended by all the women in a bride\u2019s life, including relatives. The hen party is usually only attended by close friends. My friends will usually do gag gifts or a group present for a bridal shower and then larger, nicer wedding gifts.", "Never heard if it before but if it is a USA thing it will be coming to the UK soon if its not here already. \n\nHow many gifts can anyone possibly need for signing a contract and having a party?"]}
