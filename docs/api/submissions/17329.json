The one people trot out to try to justify why you need to keep abusive family in your life (your father is abusive, his religion is abusive, the control he tries to put over you as an adult is abusive, the control i assume he had over you growing up is abusive. The fact you're posting about whether your an ass because you told your abuser father to fuck off, is proof enough of that abuse), the thing people often leave out is the full context. \"The blood of the battlefield is thicker than the water of the womb\" in short you don't owe ANYONE ANYTHING just because they are \"family\"", "Family that was worth that type of consideration would never treat you the way your dad does. If \"they're family\" only applies to one person, that's not family, it's just good old fashioned double standards and abuse.", "Jesus, I can't tell if you're trying to start an argument or if you're pulling off tough love", "The water of the womb thing is bullshit made up in the 90s that people pretend is the \u201cfull\u201d saying. It is not. It\u2019s fine not to hold family relationships as the most important, but there\u2019s no need to spread fake internet rumors.", "Sorry...tough love was my intent, not an argument. My apologies for overstepping.  Coming from my own abusive growing up....the \"because family\" thing gets me. And there are still things I'm realizing YEARS later, big and small, that my abusive parent did that I had to be told by a therapist were abuse and not just \"thats what some parents are like because of (insert church, issues, family or other thing here)\""]}
