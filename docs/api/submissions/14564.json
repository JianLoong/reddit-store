I was a SAHM until our youngest started kindergarten last year.  Since then I've been working part-time in retail.  My husband works full-time and sometimes has to travel for work, maybe one week every 2 months or so.  All that being said, I obviously do the majority of the housework and childcare.  \n\nWe have talked about him doing more at home so many times I've lost count.  He always uses the excuse that I'm home more than he is and work less so it makes sense that I should be doing more at home.  He also says that he spends a lot of time with the kids on weekends when I have to work.  But now that our kids are old enough to be in athletics and other extracurricular activities, our weekends are becoming more and more packed and things like cleaning and laundry pile up if we don't keep up with them.\n\nLast week my husband was traveling for work from Sunday-Friday so I was home with the kids by myself all week.  He was supposed to be home by noon on Friday, but his morning flight got delayed and he missed his connection.  He didn't get home until 6pm.  When he got home he started talking about how exhausted he was from getting up at 4am and how crappy his travel day was.  I told him he's not the only one who is tired and that we still have a lot of things to do on the weekend.\n\nI had to remind him that our 2 oldest have sporting events Saturday and on Sunday we are going to my parent's house for Easter.  He gave a loud and exaggerated sigh and said he was hoping to relax during the weekend and watch the Masters.  I told him that he would have to record it and watch it later but he reminded me that I \"made\" him cancel our cable subscription last year so he can't record it anymore.  I told him \"Well, guess you'll just have to catch the highlights at some point then.\"  \n\nHe offered to stay home from the games on Saturday to clean and do laundry, but I told him he needs to support our kids and he can't just stay home, do some light cleaning and a couple loads of laundry and watch golf all day.  He then asked if he could stay home from Easter with my parents since he's not religious anyway, but I told him he needs to be there too because it's important to my parents that everyone is there.  \n\nHe ended up going to all the games and to Easter as well, but he wasn't his normal jovial self.  I kept asking him what was wrong and he just said he was tired and behind on sleep.  When we got home from Easter he pretty much crashed right away and left me to deal with everything to get ready for the week.  \n\nYesterday morning I told him that I need him to help more this coming week because we have another full weekend.  More games Saturday when I'm at work and then visiting my sister and her new baby on Sunday.  He asked if he could at least stay home from visiting my sister and I asked if he was serious.  He said he just wants one day to relax and recharge and I'm being a jerk for not letting him do that.", "created_utc": 1681245607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iwv82/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_stay_home_from/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The deciding factor for me was when you decided that your parents wanting everyone over for Easter was more important than your husband's need to get some rest.

You are being inflexible and unfair. You are not granting him *any* leeway to occasionally get some rest. You both do not have to be at every single kids' sports event. Sometimes it's OK to stay home from a family visit. I can't get over how rude it is when someone says they're tired and had a long day to just immediately say \"well I'm tired too and there's lots to do, get to it\". \n\nYou should be supporting each other and finding ways for both of you to get rest when you need it. Things like one of you going to the kids\u2019 games while the other stays home and does chores, like he suggested, are great solutions.\n\nBe nicer to your husband and don't act surprised when he's not in a good mood when you don't allow him a moment to breathe, ever.", "YTA- You say that your parents get upset if everyone isn't there.  Wasn't your sister and the baby there as well?  Why a 2nd trip? \n\nI feel for the man, he's got his job telling him what to do, he's got his wife telling him what to do.

Handle your own extended family responsibilities.", "YTA but not for wanting support from your husband; it's because he's asking for some support from you and offering a compromise that he stays home and does chores to rest and recover. He's not refusing to participate in things, he's asking for a break. \n\nMaybe try to sit down and compromise a solution that respects his need for a bit of time to himself while also till making sure you get the same respect from him in regards to the work that you are doing.

I completely get where you're coming from with helping put at home and spending time with your kids, but forcing him to socialise with your family - twice - when he didn't want to doesn't seem fair.

He even offered to do some housework in exchange for being able to stay home and you said no even though you\u2019re also complaining he doesn\u2019t do enough house work. So which is it? You both are going to burn out and resent each other if you don\u2019t carve out and support personal time.", "YTA. I wasn't sure at first because Easter might be a special occasion to you and your family. Then you lost me because you expect him to \"visit your sister\" the next weekend.

It adds up so unbelievably quick!\n\nThat said, your husband was exhausted from traveling. He needed time to rest, as clearly indicated by the fact that he collapsed after Easter (an event you absolutely should not have forced him to go to).\n\nYou also need breaks, which I'm sure rarely happens, but the way you are doing this - this dictating unnecessary events (he shouldn't have to be forced to see your family, you can go by yourself) and then being mad that things at the house aren't done...", "HUGE YTA.  YOU are the one overbooking things and expecting him to just deal with it.  I have dealt with having similar schedules as your husband and the burnout from exhaustion is HUGE.  You want him to be jovial?  GIVE HIM THE TIME TO RECHARGE!", "YTA. A 14-hour day of travel and waiting around the airport is crazy exhausting, and it\u2019s fair for him to want to take it easy around the house after a week of work-related travel. He deserves a break and you\u2019re here being all passive aggressive about \u201ceveryone is tired.\u201d If he wants to miss Easter dinner, take the kids and give him a break. You don\u2019t get to make non-stop plans for him on the weekends.

If he\u2019s not religious, he shouldn\u2019t have to go to an Easter celebration to please your parents. There\u2019s also no need for him to go and visit your sister this next Sunday.", "YTA he offered to stay home and clean and that wasn't good enough, so he went to all the things you forced him to go to and that wasn't good enough! It's not like he's travelling for fun or hanging out with friends, he was working thrn travelling, which is exhaisting. He's also not refusing to help at home. Nothing is good enough for you! Your kids are old enough to understand that people get tired and need to rest, and why on earth must he visit your sister?! She's your sister! Stop dragging the man along to things he clearly doesn't want to do, you aren't his mother.", "It sounds like you are over scheduled - it also so happens that a lot of the family engagements are on your side.

Your husband busts his ass to support the family. Business travel is mentally and emotionally taxing. You sound very controlling\u2026your husband\u2019s well-being should take precedence over your mother\u2019s feelings/wants for a silly holiday. Also, it\u2019s nice to watch every game, but as a mom who has had 5 playing sports at the same time, it isn\u2019t possible and kids don\u2019t even notice or care most of the time.

OP\u2019s family obligations are not mandatory. people need to refresh especially when they are on the road. learn how to manage better and placing blame. kids are going to understand one/both parents are not going to make it some time. also, at least the 12 year old, can assist in some chores.", "My goodness. This sounds absolutely exhausting, but I don't think you're being a jerk and honestly neither is your husband IMO. NAH.\n\nLike, I get that you have family obligations, but you both need to find a way to get some downtime. Like of course your husband is exhausted, and presumably you're tired too. My guess is that you're both tired enough you're not problem solving as well as you might be otherwise.\n\nInstead of harassing your husband about his need for a break, work with him so that you BOTH can get a day off, either together or separately. Like, maybe you need to take a day and just not visit your extended family and stay home and rest instead. Even god rested on the seventh day.", "YTA this man\u2019s life sounds like hell", "You sound like a miserable piece of work. YTA", "YTA. Is it fun having this level of control over another human being?", "YTA - I understand you. You do much at home. Bathroom. Kitchen. Living room. Bedroom. Kids. Laundry. Food. Etc. You make a good job and you probably need to hear that from your partner.\n\nBUT he works. Work itself is a big topic because people struggle with work. And he is not free if that struggle, too! He is obligated to to his part and he depends on your work, but you depend on his part, too. It\u2019s not uncommon what you both go through so don\u2019t be mad or frustrated towards your partner. The difference between you and him is that he is leaving his part of his work and he is getting mean comments at home. Is that really the way you communicate after him opening a possibility for you to work less? \n\nBe more reflective at how you view him and how much you value his work.
