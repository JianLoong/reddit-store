Why are there not more comments about this? It reads to me like 'I fancy my daughter more than my fiance, and told my fiance so'.", "\"Except Maia\". I don't know about that.

I was N-T-A until I read that part.", "The \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d about made me snort in its simplicity.", "Bro you are naive af lol", "This. I really don't get the N T A votes. The fianc\u00e9 isn't blameless, but the guy who tells her his daughter is going to be prettier than her no matter what is definitely the bigger AH.

I'm sure in person, getting everyone's side of the story, seeing the actual dresses, its a much different story than what's written. I have a lot of doubt over who wrote the post as well.  \n\nAnd I agree with you 100% over what the teen thinks as appropriate. It's a wedding, the kid doesn't need anything flashy. \n\nIf this is real... stop the wedding, because the bride deserves better than a man who's fantasing his ex wife and thinks his daughter is prettier than her.

I hope.", "Her", "If this is real, which is doubtful, that just makes it feel even more like \"Maia\" is writing it. It would not be surprising at all for the daughter to make additional comments about how pretty her mom is if she doesn't like her stepmom, and also not say that her stepmom (who she, again, does not like) is beautiful.   \n\n\nThere is zero chance this happened the way it was told in the OP.

If she chose a dress which was overly revealing, or was a lot more intricate or extravagant than the bride, or wanted to wear white, sure, ask her to choose something else.

Like you said, Tara may also be an AH (although seeing what both the dresses in question look like would help make a more definitive ruling), however, telling the woman you supposedly love and intend to marry that she won\u2019t be as pretty as his daughter at their wedding makes him a bigger AH.", "Nothing wrong with saying your child is beautiful, pretty or even cute \u2026 comparing your child to the person you sleep with is odd, unsettling and a whole lot more.", "This was my issue with it. Just saying his daughter was beautiful would have been but this makes me wonder how many times this has been said to her face, that's she's very beautiful and looks just like my very beautiful ex.", "He also made a point of saying she looks exactly like her mum. Something I'm sure his fiance has heard more than once.", "> He said his daughter is pretty not the ex.\n\nNo, but he did say that Maia looks like her mom and then he said that Maia is prettier than Tara so I can see why Tara would internalize the thought that OP thinks his ex is also prettier than her.", "Depends on the dress in question.", "So do I lol", ">This, she is deliberately trying to make your daughter look less attractive so she can feel better.\n\nBased on OP's post, it's not hard to see why though.", "It's not a laid back affair, and if she's not going to get arrested, then it's not too revealing.", "Yeah it isn't exclusive to teens. Nor weddings. I once had the misfortune of seeing the red thong under the white lace mini dress on the mother of a girl going for first communion. I had a front row seat on the choir balcony. Mom put the girl in a hoop skirt so large she couldn't fit on a chair or bench or anything really, so mom literally kneeled down in the aisle and crawled under her daughters skirt to put a stool for the poor child to sit on inside of the crinoline. The only positive thing here is she angled her butt to the exit, not the altar. \n\nMom should've worn more fabric. Honestly the dress would've been nice if it had been above the knee instead intead of whatever this was. Child should have worn less fabric. It was inappropriate all around.", "My thoughts exactly\u2026 my daughter is stunning as my ex wife\u2026", "Yeah that was some gross nonsense.", "We can't know, obviously, but from OP's post I wouldn't be all that surprised if it was done on purpose.

The day isn\u2019t about her, and there is an etiquette at weddings.

If the wedding is black tie, then a fancy evening gown with sequins would be appropriate. But that also means that the bridal gown will be amazing and can't be outdone. If this is a more laid back affair like a beach wedding, then a fancy gown will be very out of place and would stick out like an obvious scream for attention. So the type of wedding they are having makes a big difference as to what kind of clothing should be worn.

If this is a black tie wedding then fancy evening gowns would be appropriate. A beach wedding? Not so much. Those tend to be more low-key and more simple styles are more appropriate.
