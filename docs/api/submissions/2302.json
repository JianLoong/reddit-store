He\u2019s not right in saying it\u2019s his resources alone. You are married and it\u2019s just as much yours, but it seems like you are helping the person who is responsible for hurting his sister.

Shame on them both, they don\u2019t deserve help.", "ESH except the SIL and baby. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. BIL for having an affair and also throwing you under the bus in the process. He has shown exactly who he is and it\u2019s not great. He willingly betrayed his wife and family and only cares that he got caught. Not thinking about the ramifications of all the dynamics and how a baby will be impacted by all of his behavior. \n\n2. Cousin for having an affair with a married man and continuing the relationship until they got caught. Not thinking about the ramifications of all the dynamics and how a baby will be impacted by her behavior.\n\n3. You for lying to your husband because he wouldn\u2019t be happy about your desire to help. You\u2019re correct that the baby is the one who may suffer if they don\u2019t have necessities but you decided the needs of the baby were more important than your marriage. You and your husband are supposed to be a team all the time, not just when it\u2019s easy and you agree. \n\n4. Your husband for saying it\u2019s his money. Y\u2019all are married and that was just a dick comment. \n\nI feel bad for the SIL who is surrounded by people who don\u2019t know what being loyal and honest means. The baby has two parents who at best have questionable morals and at worst are just bad people who don\u2019t care who they hurt as long as they get what they want. \n\nThis is probably rude but it\u2019s not your job to supplement your cousin because she doesn\u2019t have a lot of money. She and BIL decided to have a baby and are responsible for it. You picked up that responsibility for some reason but it\u2019s not yours to carry. There are many programs in the US that can help with the needs of the baby. You unilaterally decided to support a baby at the expense of your relationship with your husband, SIL and other in laws.", "Yta\n\nShe caused her own mess, and you're playing captainsaveacheat.

You weren't, the minute you chose to stay silent, you chose to be a participant of that deceit. \n\nAnd to now even add insult to injury, you want to spend HIS money on the affair child? the secondhand embarrassment I feel.", "Yes YTA with a trashy family", "YTA. Your cousin helped break up a marriage. The sister's husband is obviously the biggest offender since he was the one who broke his vows. Your husband and his family are supporting his betrayed sister. If you value your marriage I would cut cousin out of my life. This situation could very easily cause the breakdown of another marriage, yours.", "YTA. Helping someone who helped DEVESTATE a family member??? Wtf?!? Maybe her affair partner and baby daddy should worry about helping her. This person HURT your husband\u2019s sister. At least your husband knows where your loyalty lies.", "Y T A. I get you want to help your cousin but her situation is based on her choices. As far as your husband is concerned what you're doing is a slap in the face to him and I would assume to his sister( your sister in law). Since her husband was dumb enough to knock his affair up it's his job to take care of the baby. Not yours.", "There are two separate issues here, and I suggest that you address each one separately. \n\nWhether or not you\u2019re TA regarding the first issue depends on your behaviour during those few days.  If you gave your cousin and BIL a chance to come clean on their own, and they took it, then NTA.  Every time this comes up, say, \u201cWhen I found out, I told [BIL] that he had to tell [SIL] within [three days] or I\u2019d tell her myself.  He came forward on his own, so I didn\u2019t have to.   Isn\u2019t that better than if I\u2019d just posted it on Facebook or something?\u201d\n\nAs for the second issue: your husband kinda has a point.   It\u2019s not actually your job to buy things for this child.  It\u2019s BIL\u2019s job.   You know, the dad?   \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to buy your cousin a pack of diapers once the baby is here, but helping her prep is another thing entirely.  Babies don\u2019t need that much as essential equipment when they\u2019re newborn.   They need a few changes of clothes, some diapers, and a safe place to sleep - which can be anything from a top-of-the-range crib to a literal drawer pulled out and placed on the floor.  Maybe your cousin needs to visit a charity store for some gently used items if she\u2019s very financially stretched.", "NAH. Husband absolutely has the right to feel hurt by this, his sisters life was just corrupted and your cousin shares the blame with your BIL, I don\u2019t wanna see people calling misogynistic or anything, but no I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good person at all if you choose to pursue someone that is in a committed relationship with someone else. That is just wrong all around. No one is saying BIL isn\u2019t to blame, he\u2019s the one who broke his marriage by cheating, but cousin also decided to partake in this. And I do feel like that child is no one else\u2019s responsibility in this situation but BIL and cousin. So I do feel that husband is 100% in his rights to be upset. However, if you used your own money for this, I can\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH either. Because again, the baby didn\u2019t do anything wrong to anyone, it was it\u2019s parents that decided to do what they did. But yeah, cousin and BOL deserve all the karma coming their way.\n\nEDIT: I also want to add, that this might end your marriage. Husband may never be okay with the fact that you choose to have a relationship with your cousin.", "YTA. Husbands family should throw all of you away (you, cousin, brother in law)", "NTA.

Whose fault is that? \n\nDo you earn your own money? Quietly get her a gift card so she can buy diapers or a stroller or whatever. But unless you want to risk your marriage, you're going to need to ask yourself if you're going to go over to help once the baby is born, offer to babysit, etc. and expect your husband to be A-OK with it.\n\nI would also seriously, seriously get couples counseling. You need to resolve things with your husband.", "NTA, he wants you to punish a baby for something their parents did? Frankly that says more about him than it does about you.

How can you do this to your sister in law and your husband. Your cousin knew what she was getting into. If she isn\u2019t well off the she should of kept her legs closed especially to married men.

But let\u2019s not pretend the cousin is innocent. She didn\u2019t break her vows like BIL but what she did do is not give a shit what this would do to YOUR marriage by having an affair with your husbands brother in law. She didn\u2019t care that this would hurt you and your husbands relationship. She didn\u2019t care when she decided to keep said child that she couldn\u2019t afford it.

Also, your cousin needs help if she's a single mom with no support.\n\nYou should probably step back at least for a bit or until the baby is born.  Feelings are still raw and the more you do then the more raw they will get.  For sure your husband isn't being fair to you because your cousin needs family.  Have an honest discussion with him so he understands where you stand.  This is your cousin that you want to help out regardless of the circumstances.  You do not care to have your cousin go without under any circumstance and, even though conceived during an affair, the baby is a member of your family.\n\nYou need to stick to your guns and hold your head high with all of these people and remind them you were not the one that had the affair, the brother in law and the cousin were and he needs to be the one that receives their anger.

She didn't have to \"go after him\" to be equally at fault. They both knew he was married and how babies get made.", "The baby is also an innocent victim", "Preach!!", "Do we know that the cousin new the guy was married though? Just because she is OP's cousin doesn't mean she knows OPs in-laws.", "Definitely not equally to blame.", "So be default you want to blame the baby as well? Yeah it was shifty on both sides but anyone who takes their anger out on an innocent unborn child is a major AH.", "Where am I saying that his vows are void? Where do you get the impression that I think he's innocent of blame in all of this.  I am saying it is just as likely he is the one who chased after her.", "Ahhh, so the obligation to others ends there. Gotcha, that seems to me a very limited and, if I may say, selfish worldview.", "You are free to persist in your error just as I am free to continue to act and believe in accordance with simple morality.", "Thanks. And thanks for bringing an actual christian value up online. Most of so-called christian values online are hate on minorities nowadays. I think its a good point to not actually punish and harm the person but let them live the consequences. Thats not the same btw, a punishment is not a consequence, tho many frame it that way.", "Did I say it was?", "You are making a great many erroneous assumptions there Chuck, not least of which is my opinion regarding Jesus.\n\nYou are the sort of atheist that makes a legitimate philosophy seem like neckbeard stuff. But I bet your mon rhinks your smart, that's something at least \ud83e\udd23", "Yes, as I've said repeatedly now, it is their - joint - money. Not just his or hers. His and hers.", "Yes - because OP spent their joint money without discussing it with him.\n\nIf she had - there is every chance this wouldn't even be an issue because she could have helped her husband see why, in her view, spending the money would be the right thing to do. But she didn't; she knew he wouldn't be happy about it so went behind his back instead.", "Yet she never discussed their joint money going to this baby and the cousin. The cousin and BIL that completely wrecked OP's husband's sister.\n\nIf she wanted to spend joint money, there should have been a discussion.", "Oh yes, I with my extensive multi-year history on reddit, am the cousin, idiot.", "Just because he says it is \"His\" doesn't necessarily make it so.", "We are here to talk about OPs actions not the family\u2019s actions. If we were here to discuss the family\u2019s action where OP was blaming the husband, then OP wouldn\u2019t be the AH.\n\nBut we are here talking about OP\u2019s support for her homewrecking cousin who knowingly inserted herself into a married couples relationship. Moreover, OP is using shared finances to support the cousin. OP is obviously the AH. And her actions will eventually lead to her own divorce.", "They. Were. Still. Married. If they wanted to pursue new relationships, they could have proceeded with the divorce.", "By indirectly helping the cousin whom was also at fault.. You wanna tell the sister she shouldn't be hurt by what OP is doing?", "so you want him to support the women that Hurt his sister how can you expect that be real", "I'm sorry, I have to disagree. BIL chose to break his vows and damage his marriage with the sister and he deserves far more responsibility. But unless the encounter wasn't consensual, you have to pin some responsibility on the cousin as well,. And you're going to have a very hard time telling hub's sister that she shouldn't be hurt by the cousin's involvement; cause she would be right to be hurt, the BIL's actions hurt \\*more\\* but the cousin's actions hurt her as well.", "Doesn\u2019t matter who pursued who tbh it was wrong af on both parties either way", "It really doesn\u2019t matter. She could have said no. She obviously didn\u2019t.", "so you want him to support the women that Hurt his sister how can you expect that be real", "I disagree. They are equally to blame for their actions, but the family\u2019s anger should be on him primarily, not the cousin.", "I think we found the cousin here\u2026", "I didn't say I was blaming the baby. I said the baby was innocent, but the baby's parents are not.", "How is he taking out his anger on an unborn child?", "I don't get why we need to take vows to be decent people. Like at least extend a little empathy to others and avoid sleeping with married people. Let those married losers ruin their marriage some other way.", "You saying who pursued who matters implicitly means that is she made a play for him it is her fault and at least mitigates his guilt if not absolving him completely.\n\nIf that is not what you meant to imply then please explain why it matters in the context of him breaking his vow because you seem adamant that it does matter.", "If your sense of morality tells you that it's okay to sleep with married people, because if they are fine with breaking their vows then why should you care...\n\nWell, to each their own, but fuck. It's called empathy, clearly you've never heard of it.", "I couldn't have said it better \ud83d\ude42\n\nThanks for this", "You brought it up, not me.", "Bold of you to assume I'm atheist Kevin. \n\nI should ask her if she thinks I'm smart, maybe I'll even get cookies for my intellectual ability. I would share with you but I'm sure you wouldn't get it.", "Maybe that would be in the best interests of OP if they did get a divorce because hubby calling shared finances \"his\" sounds like a red flag.", "So if you are separated you can't have sex until the divorce is final.? That's not how life works.", "They both agreed to separate and the wife knew about their relationship during the separation, it wasn\u2019t an affair as made very clear by the post", "Bet you think women don't deserve child support either because the mom might indirectly benefit from it.", "Blame the child for the sins of the father/mother. Is that what you want?\n You don't have to support the mother for what she did but you can help support her with what she may need for the baby.", "I don't see that I am obligated to honour or respect your commitments when you don't.\n\nIf I take a vow of silence must you be mute in my presence or is it up to me to vouchsafe my honour and oaths?", "More blame lies with the husband.", "The argument raised is that by punishing the mother, they are punishing the kid; ergo the mother shouldn't be punished or something?\n\nI'm not buying it, unless this affair wasn't consensual, the cousin and BIL are both responsible for this mess and there should be consequences; we cannot absolve the pregnant cousin of the responsibility for her part in the affair just because she is pregnant.", "The person I replied to said she \"pursued him\" like they were certain of it, as if to place ALL the blame on her. I countered with my question, implying that it is just as likely, if not more that HE was the one who pursued her. Long story short is I am AGREEING with you for fuck sake.\n\nEDIT: And even if she had , no his vows would not become null and void.", "In the context of my choice in sources of moral teaching.\n\n I'm also a fan of Kant, does that necessarily imply that you are too or that you ought to be?", "Okay, so you're not an atheist then.... yay?\n\n\"I could do it but I don't wanna\" is pitiable for a 2nd grader Cletus, perhaps you'll see that when you move up a year.", "Maaaate.\n\nYou've made a few good points in this thread, and I've upvoted. But cool yer jets, yeah?\n\nBoth affair-fuckers are fuckers. and the size of the fuckitude isn't as relevant as you're trying to make it.", "Where did I say anything remotely close to that?", "I'm not blaming the child, nor do I think the child should be blamed. I believe the parents are responsible for the sins; but that while the BIL does deserve more blame and responsibility for his actions in breaking his vows, the cousin is not absolved of fault.", "In your example, if somebody knew you made a vow of silence and attempted to get you to break it, which you did - I would hold both people equally accountable.\n\nIt doesn't matter if that other person didn't make their own vow of silence, they still know you did and didn't give a shit about it.", "That's not what anyone is saying,that child is gonna have a shitty tough life between OPs husband and the SiL and her husband if they stay together. Everyone is saying g the child needs help, giving her diapers, baby toys, ect is for the child's well being.\n\nBy not giving that because the cousin had an affair is punishing the child.", "If you bring it up, you should expect it to be addressed.\n\nSo you'd be fine with your spouse buying a baby gift with YOUR heard earned money for the person who helped your sibling's partner cheat?  I sure AF wouldn't."]}
