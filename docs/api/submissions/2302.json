He\u2019s not right in saying it\u2019s his resources alone. You are married and it\u2019s just as much yours, but it seems like you are helping the person who is responsible for hurting his sister.

Shame on them both, they don\u2019t deserve help.", "ESH except the SIL and baby. Here\u2019s why:\n\n1. BIL for having an affair and also throwing you under the bus in the process. He has shown exactly who he is and it\u2019s not great. He willingly betrayed his wife and family and only cares that he got caught. Not thinking about the ramifications of all the dynamics and how a baby will be impacted by all of his behavior. \n\n2. Cousin for having an affair with a married man and continuing the relationship until they got caught. Not thinking about the ramifications of all the dynamics and how a baby will be impacted by her behavior.\n\n3. You for lying to your husband because he wouldn\u2019t be happy about your desire to help. You\u2019re correct that the baby is the one who may suffer if they don\u2019t have necessities but you decided the needs of the baby were more important than your marriage. You and your husband are supposed to be a team all the time, not just when it\u2019s easy and you agree. \n\n4. Your husband for saying it\u2019s his money. Y\u2019all are married and that was just a dick comment. \n\nI feel bad for the SIL who is surrounded by people who don\u2019t know what being loyal and honest means. The baby has two parents who at best have questionable morals and at worst are just bad people who don\u2019t care who they hurt as long as they get what they want. \n\nThis is probably rude but it\u2019s not your job to supplement your cousin because she doesn\u2019t have a lot of money. She and BIL decided to have a baby and are responsible for it. You picked up that responsibility for some reason but it\u2019s not yours to carry. There are many programs in the US that can help with the needs of the baby. You unilaterally decided to support a baby at the expense of your relationship with your husband, SIL and other in laws.", "Yta\n\nShe caused her own mess, and you're playing captainsaveacheat. Hope your husband pays attention cuz you're showing who you are. \n\nIntead of doing the decent thing and telling the actual wife, you kept quiet and now act as if you're the innocent bystander. You weren't, the minute you chose to stay silent, you chose to be a participant of that deceit. \n\nAnd to now even add insult to injury, you want to spend HIS money on the affair child? the secondhand embarrassment I feel.", "Yes YTA with a trashy family", "YTA. Your cousin helped break up a marriage. The sister's husband is obviously the biggest offender since he was the one who broke his vows. Your husband and his family are supporting his betrayed sister. If you value your marriage I would cut cousin out of my life. This situation could very easily cause the breakdown of another marriage, yours.", "YTA. Helping someone who helped DEVESTATE a family member??? Wtf?!? Maybe her affair partner and baby daddy should worry about helping her. This person HURT your husband\u2019s sister. At least your husband knows where your loyalty lies.", "Y T A. I get you want to help your cousin but her situation is based on her choices. As far as your husband is concerned what you're doing is a slap in the face to him and I would assume to his sister( your sister in law). Since her husband was dumb enough to knock his affair up it's his job to take care of the baby. Not yours.", "There are two separate issues here, and I suggest that you address each one separately. \n\nWhether or not you\u2019re TA regarding the first issue depends on your behaviour during those few days.  If you gave your cousin and BIL a chance to come clean on their own, and they took it, then NTA.  Every time this comes up, say, \u201cWhen I found out, I told [BIL] that he had to tell [SIL] within [three days] or I\u2019d tell her myself.  He came forward on his own, so I didn\u2019t have to.   Isn\u2019t that better than if I\u2019d just posted it on Facebook or something?\u201d\n\nAs for the second issue: your husband kinda has a point.   It\u2019s not actually your job to buy things for this child.  It\u2019s BIL\u2019s job.   You know, the dad?   \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to buy your cousin a pack of diapers once the baby is here, but helping her prep is another thing entirely.  Babies don\u2019t need that much as essential equipment when they\u2019re newborn.   They need a few changes of clothes, some diapers, and a safe place to sleep - which can be anything from a top-of-the-range crib to a literal drawer pulled out and placed on the floor.  Maybe your cousin needs to visit a charity store for some gently used items if she\u2019s very financially stretched.", "NAH. Husband absolutely has the right to feel hurt by this, his sisters life was just corrupted and your cousin shares the blame with your BIL, I don\u2019t wanna see people calling misogynistic or anything, but no I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a good person at all if you choose to pursue someone that is in a committed relationship with someone else. That is just wrong all around. No one is saying BIL isn\u2019t to blame, he\u2019s the one who broke his marriage by cheating, but cousin also decided to partake in this. And I do feel like that child is no one else\u2019s responsibility in this situation but BIL and cousin. So I do feel that husband is 100% in his rights to be upset. However, if you used your own money for this, I can\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH either. Because again, the baby didn\u2019t do anything wrong to anyone, it was it\u2019s parents that decided to do what they did. But yeah, cousin and BOL deserve all the karma coming their way.\n\nEDIT: I also want to add, that this might end your marriage. Husband may never be okay with the fact that you choose to have a relationship with your cousin.", "YTA. Husbands family should throw all of you away (you, cousin, brother in law)", "NTA.

Whose fault is that? \n\nDo you earn your own money? Quietly get her a gift card so she can buy diapers or a stroller or whatever. But unless you want to risk your marriage, you're going to need to ask yourself if you're going to go over to help once the baby is born, offer to babysit, etc. and expect your husband to be A-OK with it.\n\nI would also seriously, seriously get couples counseling. You need to resolve things with your husband.", "NTA, he wants you to punish a baby for something their parents did? Frankly that says more about him than it does about you.

How can you do this to your sister in law and your husband. Your cousin knew what she was getting into. If she isn\u2019t well off the she should of kept her legs closed especially to married men.

But let\u2019s not pretend the cousin is innocent. She didn\u2019t break her vows like BIL but what she did do is not give a shit what this would do to YOUR marriage by having an affair with your husbands brother in law. She didn\u2019t care that this would hurt you and your husbands relationship. She didn\u2019t care when she decided to keep said child that she couldn\u2019t afford it.

Also, your cousin needs help if she's a single mom with no support.\n\nYou should probably step back at least for a bit or until the baby is born.  Feelings are still raw and the more you do then the more raw they will get.  For sure your husband isn't being fair to you because your cousin needs family.  Have an honest discussion with him so he understands where you stand.  This is your cousin that you want to help out regardless of the circumstances.  You do not care to have your cousin go without under any circumstance and, even though conceived during an affair, the baby is a member of your family.\n\nYou need to stick to your guns and hold your head high with all of these people and remind them you were not the one that had the affair, the brother in law and the cousin were and he needs to be the one that receives their anger.

Sure she could have let them be adopted, but she doesn't believe in that. We don't speak of the other option. \n\nSo I gave her baby a care package. I made sure it wasn't for her, but of course it would inevitably benefit her too. Well, my own marriage imploded because of that. My husband and his family thought it was cruel that I would directly support people who hurt his sister. I saw it as me helping my own family member at the time, who had no one else to support her! I couldn't let a member of my family suffer because her mother made a bad choice (the dad, ofc, made a worse choice, but he's as much the black sheep in the family as my cousin is these days.).\n\nWell, my cousin still has no family or friends to support her. This caused my own marriage to implode, so I started working two jobs to survive and to help take care of the baby. Meanwhile, she goes on to have two more kids. One by her coworkers husband and one by the husband of a friend she made, until that friend discovered the affair! Well, she still can't support these kids. She's constantly asking me to come over to baby-sit, and tells me that if I don't, then she'll just let the oldest be in charge. Plus, I'm still giving her money to feed her kids.\n\nI'm just so tired of being the breadwinner for her kids and I recently realized that she's been taking advantage of me all these years.
