Both of my wife\u2019s parents have passed, her mom about 14 years ago and her dad about 5 years ago. My wife works in the medical field and works a lot of hours. During the work week she\u2019s typically gone for almost 10 to 11 hours and barely sees the kids in the morning and only for a couple of hours at night. My mom watches the kids in the morning for about an hour before school and then a little over an hour after school 4x a week. So, she gets to see the kids probably more than my wife does during the school week.  During summer break, my mom is usually watching the kids 3x a week for about 8 hours a day. \n\nNow my wife is excellent with coming up with activities to do with the kids on the weekend. Once or twice a month it will be a planned event like Disney on Ice, see a reptile show, visit an apple orchard, see a play or musical at the local high school, etc. On several occasions I wanted to invite my parents to some of these events but end up getting push back from my wife. My wife\u2019s argument is that she barely gets to the see the kids during the week and wants some quality time with them, and if my mom comes, the kids will just ignore her and want to hang out with my parents instead. In her defense, she\u2019s right. My kids love their grandma and will pretty much ignore both of us when she\u2019s present, so I see my wife\u2019s point of view.\n\nMy mom\u2019s feeling then get hurt when she sees the photos later on up on Facebook and wants to know how come she wasn\u2019t invited. Now I\u2019m not saying my parents don\u2019t get invited to anything, because they do. They\u2019ve been on 2 Disney Trips with us and plenty of other events, but the majority I feel are the smaller local events that might last an hour. I just feel like recently my mom has been excluded more. We\u2019ve had 4 planned events recently and we didn\u2019t invite my parents to any of these. I brought this up with my wife and a big argument ensued, \u201cYour mom gets to see the kids plenty during the week or when she\u2019s babysitting\u201d. My argument is that my parents are not our nannies, and them watching the kids during the week isn\u2019t exactly fun time. I\u2019ve told my wife I don\u2019t want to invite my parents to every event, but maybe every 3rd or 4th event, but I still get pushback on this. I then ask, \u201cIf your parents were still alive would you be excluding them as well or is it just my parents for some reason?\u201d. I know my wife doesn\u2019t hate my parents, but I know she sometimes gets annoyed because of conflicting personalities.\n\nMy mom is 67, and my dad just passed away a few months ago. Life is sometimes short, and anything could happen. I would like to see my kids spend as much time as possible with their grandparents at this fun age. I don\u2019t want to make separate activities where I specifically invite my mom because it just makes the month too busy or will just end up taking the kids from my wife if she doesn\u2019t want to come with.", "created_utc": 1677263484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11aydi4/aita_for_wanting_to_invite_my_mom_to_my_wifes/", "score": 820, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Life is short, which is why your wife wants time with HER kids during the fun age, too. Her time is already limited due to her job.", ">I don\u2019t want to make separate activities where I specifically invite my mom because it just makes the month too busy or will just end up taking the kids from my wife if she doesn\u2019t want to come with.\n\nSorry, but this is the solution.  You just don't want to hear it because it requires work from you.  If you want your mom to be able to come to outings with your family once a month, talk to your wife about 1 weekend a month being set aside for YOU to make plans for a fun family day that will include your mom.  This will free up your wife a bit, and if she decides she doesn't want to come...well, women appreciate time away from their families too every now and again.  Your wife is a grown woman who can make that choice for herself if she would prefer a day to herself or a day with her kids.\n\nRight now, you want to have your cake and eat it too.  You want YOUR WIFE to keep planning fun family events, but you want to force her to plan them in a way that you prefer.  Nope.  If you want to control who is invited to an event, you need to be the one planning it.  If your wife is the one setting up activities, she's also the one who gets to decide who is invited and if this is something she wants to do just with her family or with her MIL as well.  \n\nYou're not wrong that it would be great to invite your mom along to your family outings, but you are wrong in thinking you should be able to force your wife to invite her to events for your family that *she* planned.  Start planning things yourself if you want to invite your mom.  YTA", "YOU need to plan an event with specifically involving your mom from the start. don\u2019t have your wife plan a trip and then ask to invite your mom.", "Why can't your mom do some of these events on the days  she's babysitting, \n\nLet your wife invite if she wants.  These are her days to have fun with her children", "YTA. Your mother can certainly plan activities for the children taking them on solo adventures. There's no reason for her to tag along on the things your wife plans. She spends time with them all week which is helpful for everyone involved. Your wife has a stressful job with long hours. Her time making memories with her children is important. Grandma needs to stop playing the victim here.", "Idk\u2026 personally I think if you want your mom to be spending a lot of time with the kids then you need to be the one planning the outings. Not trying to take over the ones that your wife plans. I do think maybe every 4th time or so would be a good compromise, BUT I think you should be the one planning that outing instead of your wife. \n\nThat way it\u2019s not you getting your mom to take over your wife\u2019s event, but just inviting her to yours.\n\nEditing to add: I do think it\u2019s a little strange that your mom sees the fun posts on Facebook and then calls and asks why she wasn\u2019t invited. Just seems kinda rude to me personally and is not something I would appreciate. Could be part of your wife\u2019s issue with it as well.", "YTA. \n\nI almost went N A H, but then I read the comments of yours and thought about it. \n\nIf you want your mom included in more fun activities, then take the day off and take your mom out with the kids. Or plan additional activities with the whole family. \n\nYour wife has limited time with the kids and wants to maximize the time she has - totally fair. \n\nYour mom does get more time with the kids than your wife does- which is a tribute to your mom for being a great grandma and doing all the childcare for you. \n\nYour wife plans things, you do not, but you want your mom included- see the problem. \n\nYour wife is the mother of your children, and you should want HER to spend as much time as possible with the kids, and with that last line on your post, it seems you think your mom should be the priority (it just comes across that way, I'm not saying you are an AH for that). \n\nYou have the ability to plan things, but instead you just want your mom included, and that's the only solution you can come up with. How about you be in charge and get shit organized too, and then your mom can be there.", "After reading all the other comments under this thread, YTA. Here are some of my reasons: \n\n- You contradict yourself in several responses to other people. You stated that your mother sees them 4x a week during school and during the summer 3x a week for 8 hours yet in another comment, you mention she only babysits once every couple months. Which is it? Does she take care of them several times a week or not?\n\n- You said that you can\u2019t/are unwilling to plan events specifically for your mother to attend bc it \u201cmakes your month too busy\u201d yet you expect your wife, who works long shifts and possibly works more than you, to accommodate your mother\u2019s feelings about being left out. How is it fair that you don\u2019t have to make plans for your mother to spend time with the children but expect your wife to work around her limited time to include your mother in activities?\n\n- you admitted that the children adore your mother and ignore you and your wife while she is around. It\u2019s completely understandable as to why she doesn\u2019t want your mother around during events she planned specifically for quality time with her children. \n\n- The events are your wife\u2019s time to be with her children. It\u2019s not her responsibility to invite your mother to the events she planned specifically so she can have quality time with her children. You can\u2019t demand her to include your mother in her limited free time when you yourself aren\u2019t willing to make plans for your mother. \n\nI think the best solution to your issue is to just make the plans yourself. Stop trying to include your mom on activities that your wife planned specifically to spend time with her kids when you know she doesn\u2019t see them as much as she wants to. If you want your mother to come to events, you need to plan them yourself. It\u2019s slightly disrespectful to your wife to have her carry the burden of inviting your mom, especially since you won\u2019t put forward the same effort.", "YTA. Your wife wants to spend time with her nuclear family. Your mother is not part of her nuclear family. Plan your own separate activities if you want to include your mother, don\u2019t try to force her into activities your wife plans.", "Hard YTA just for that \u201cif your parents were alive\u201d comment.  Maybe her parents would be more included, maybe they wouldn\u2019t.  Either way, it\u2019s a shitty accusation and it\u2019s not like she can defend herself since there\u2019s no way to know because *they\u2019re dead*.", "Yta. Softly. Your wife wants quality time with her children. Completely reasonable.\nIf you want your mom included, and I totally see why, especially since her husband recently passed away, YOU need to be the one to step up and plan something.", "You forgot to report the schedule on which you are responsible for caring for the children and taking them on outings. That's OK. We'll wait.", "YTA - plan your own activities and invite your mom to those. Your wife works all week and wants to spend quality time with her kids and you.", "As a nanny who frequently spends time off duty with my nanny family, I can see both sides. Ultimately, if your mom is upset that she never gets to do fun events with the kids, you and her should plan things for the 3 of them to do during the time she has them. It'd be weird if i complained to my boss about never doing fun stuff when she's given me permission to pretty much plan whatever event we want. Watching children doesn't have to be *babysitting*. Buy a zoo pass or a museum pass. Make a list of interesting parks for them to visit. \n\nThe next time your mom does join in a weekend event, watch everyone closely. Does your mom give your wife the space to parent her children? Does she redirect them to your wife if they come to her for things other than conversation? Or is your mom acting like your kids mom? Believe it or not, many parents enjoy the mundane tasks of parenting and your mom may be in the way of your wife getting to actually be a parent. When I'm hanging out but not working, we always tell the kid that \"I'm off the clock, go ask mommy or daddy.\"\n\nYou also mention them having conflicting personalities. Is your wife always compromising/bowing down to your mom to avoid conflict? Is your wife always trying to navigate/walk on eggshells to please your mom so everyone has a good time? Or is there just lack of conversation and some awkwardness? \n\nYou have to sit back and watch closely. Like you're a stranger observing them as wildlife. You may be impervious to your mom's negative behavior. Or you  may discover that your wife is egging on your mom or overall not giving her a chance. Or maybe your children play them off each other. \n\nUntil I have more info, I have to say NAH. I can understand both sides completely. I will say y t a if you continue to push your wife to include your mom. If special events with your mom mean that much to you and her, then plan them. \n>I don\u2019t want to make separate activities where I specifically invite my mom because it just makes the month too busy or will just end up taking the kids from my wife if she doesn\u2019t want to come with.\n\nThis is an excuse. Is there absolutely no other time to do things besides when your wife is off? If not, then you give your wife the option of attending or staying home for the couple of hours disney on ice takes. You have to decide if special events with mom is more important than the \"month being too busy\".", "Honestly, YTA. \n\nYour wife is allowed to want to have family events with her kids- your mom doesn\u2019t *always* have to be involved. If you want her involved- why don\u2019t you plan some activities?\n\nAlso, major YTA for that low blow", "YTA, why does your wife have to plan the activities? If you\u2019re so bothered why don\u2019t you boss up and plan a day for your mom and kids? Wah wah my mommy\u2019s getting left out, grow up dude.", "YTA. Your wife works a lot and wants to get some alone time with the kids. That\u2019s understandable. Why don\u2019t you plan activities with grandma for times your wife is working? Why does your wife have to do all the planning? Also you are an unreliable narrator as you have changed the story in the comments.", "YTA - I know this is a tough situation but you're forgetting how much it deeply impacts your wife to be away from the kids. The trips and things she plans are valuable time to create core memories and bonding that she doesn't normally get. And once these years are gone, they're gone forever. \n\nI understand it bothers your mother but in this situation, she should be more understanding of the very little time your wife has in the kids formative years. Grandma is not just a nanny - she gets invited on vacations and dinners and other small things here and there. The kids adore her. She should know she's loved and appreciated and if she doesn't, that's a separate issue. \n\nYour wife has every right to plan special events with her children, who she rarely gets to see, without feeling obligated to invite someone along. Period.", "YTA, your wife plans this time to be with her children. Your wife's time is limited, it sounds like you all are getting something from her long work hours and career in terms of lifestyle.

Yes I bolded that because she is taking the time and effort to find, plan and schedule these activities.

Both of my wife\u2019s parents have passed, her mom about 14 years ago and her dad about 5 years ago. My wife works in the medical field and works a lot of hours. During the work week she\u2019s typically gone for almost 10 to 11 hours and barely sees the kids in the morning and only for a couple of hours at night. My mom watches the kids in the morning for about an hour before school and then a little over an hour after school 4x a week. So, she gets to see the kids probably more than my wife does during the school week.  During summer break, my mom is usually watching the kids 3x a week for about 8 hours a day. \n\nNow my wife is excellent with coming up with activities to do with the kids on the weekend. Once or twice a month it will be a planned event like Disney on Ice, see a reptile show, visit an apple orchard, see a play or musical at the local high school, etc. On several occasions I wanted to invite my parents to some of these events but end up getting push back from my wife. My wife\u2019s argument is that she barely gets to the see the kids during the week and wants some quality time with them, and if my mom comes, the kids will just ignore her and want to hang out with my parents instead. In her defense, she\u2019s right. My kids love their grandma and will pretty much ignore both of us when she\u2019s present, so I see my wife\u2019s point of view.\n\nMy mom\u2019s feeling then get hurt when she sees the photos later on up on Facebook and wants to know how come she wasn\u2019t invited. Now I\u2019m not saying my parents don\u2019t get invited to anything, because they do. They\u2019ve been on 2 Disney Trips with us and plenty of other events, but the majority I feel are the smaller local events that might last an hour. I just feel like recently my mom has been excluded more. We\u2019ve had 4 planned events recently and we didn\u2019t invite my parents to any of these. I brought this up with my wife and a big argument ensued, \u201cYour mom gets to see the kids plenty during the week or when she\u2019s babysitting\u201d. My argument is that my parents are not our nannies, and them watching the kids during the week isn\u2019t exactly fun time. I\u2019ve told my wife I don\u2019t want to invite my parents to every event, but maybe every 3rd or 4th event, but I still get pushback on this. I then ask, \u201cIf your parents were still alive would you be excluding them as well or is it just my parents for some reason?\u201d. I know my wife doesn\u2019t hate my parents, but I know she sometimes gets annoyed because of conflicting personalities.\n\nMy mom is 67, and my dad just passed away a few months ago. Life is sometimes short, and anything could happen. I would like to see my kids spend as much time as possible with their grandparents at this fun age. I don\u2019t want to make separate activities where I specifically invite my mom because it just makes the month too busy or will just end up taking the kids from my wife if she doesn\u2019t want to come with.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Perhaps you can plan some weekend events, instead of your wife, and invite your mother, but she shouldn\u2019t expect to come to all of them. Your wife is entitled to family time without your Mom but the fact that she dismisses her wanting to come to the fun events because she \u201csees them during the week\u201d when she\u2019s essentially nannying for you sucks. That is taking advantage of your Mom and then using that against her. Also the fact that your wife seems to feel like she doesn\u2019t spend enough time with her kids due to her work doesn\u2019t trump your feelings that you\u2019d like your mom to spend more time with your family while she can. The fact that you dropped your dads death in the last few months at the bottom changes everything too. Your Mom needs her family more than ever right now.

I get why your wife doesn't want your mum around during these trips because they're quality time for her. She works long hours, hardly sees the kids and if your mum is there, then she will be ignored. That being said, I do agree that your wife's reasoning is that she gets to spend time with the kids when babysitting. I agree that it is not the same as going out as a family. Your mum is recently widowed, she is the kids last remaining grandparent, so maybe it is your turn to plan ahead for an outing once a month that she can come to. It doesn't have to be a big trip. Just head out for a meal or ice cream, bowling, etc. Bowling, you can have the kids and mum on a team against you and your mum. Your wife can get bonding time when cheering on whooping daddy and nanny. Just plan something that isn't a whole day adventure that your wife will be ignored at the whole time but just an hour or so. You can do quality time with just your wife and kids before or after. \n\nSpeak to both your mum and your wife separately, explain camly to your wife the reasonings behind and try and come up with a plan that works for you both.

She is working hard for her kids and wants to spend some quality time with them.

That all-together family time is important. That said, it's a balance. You don't invite your mom to everything. If you do 2 fun activities a month, she should be able to come to one.\n\nYour wife and mom need to talk this out instead of putting you dead center. Both tug at your heart strings. Both using guilt on you. Your mom is not going to be around forever, so I'd lean towards letting her come on stuff more often, especially since she lost her husband a few months ago and now spends her alone time truly alone.", "I was going to say you were a liitttlleee bit of an asshole at first, but I feel like you were compromising with maybe inviting mom on every 3rd or 4th event \ud83e\udd14 I feel like that\u2019s an acceptable middle ground.

Also, what are the tensions you mention in passing between your mother and your wife?", "Okay. So what your wife technically mean is that \"kids will see grandma when she's babysitting them (aka working) and doesn't have to see them later). So your wife gets all the fun times with the kids while poor granny has to take care of them (for free?) and is not allowed to join any events. Sorry OP your wife sounds selfish af.

I'm not gonna edit the original text so people aren't confused.\n\nI think now the wife is entitled to attend events with her kids without gramma. Especially since she gets to see them very little. The grandma is invited to events and she can't expect to tag along everywhere ( I get that she's lonely but still).\n\nAlso now that I've read the story a couple of times the wording aren't right like OP mentions how his dad died then says that both of his parents are invited on trips, then says how grandma only watches them a few times a month while a contradicting statement was clearly there in the post.

Your ask for inviting your mum on every 3rd/4th trip is actually reasonable too, a fair compromise. \n\nAnd your mum probably feels used at times when she does the \u201cgrunt work\u201d of parenting but never is involved in the fun stuff.

I REALLY do, having been a very busy working mom with too little time to spend with the kids.  And definitely,  there should be tile set aside for mom to spend time with the kids.  But it doesn't have to be all of the time, and such involved,  supportive, caring grandparents should be celebrated and welcomed at least every few outings, or on the big ones.   But also?  Quality time with the kids doesn't have to be fancy.   It's helping them clean their rooms.  It's practicing catching the ball in the yard.  It's walking around the block.  My mom,  a single mom with NO nearby support, took us kids out of school,  one kid per a month,  for her lunch hour.  The kid of the month has lunch with mom at a restaurant of their choosing.

Probably not a great idea for home harmony though.", "NTA. \n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable for your wife to just want some time for you, her and the kids to do things together.  As you acknowledge, your mom doesn't need to be included in every family event. \n\nHowever, excluding your mother from every event on the weekends seems a bit cruel. Does she only get to interact with the kids when she's babysitting or providing another service? I don't think it's too much to ask that, once a month or so, she be included in the plans. \n\nThe fact that your wife has an issue with this makes me think there might be deeper issues here:\n\n1) Do your wife and mother not get along? If your mom is one of those mother-in-laws who try to \"help\" parent or offer a lot of \"helpful\" suggestions, it would make sense why your wife doesn't want her along. Let's be honest, even sweetly worded criticisms are still criticisms, and nobody wants someone like that along on their down time. \n\n2) Your wife may be jealous of the amount of time that Grandma gets to spend with her kids. However, if that's the case, she needs to suck it up and be thankful they have a loving presence in their lives. I assume your wife chooses to work the hours she does, so she needs to be gracious about the fact that her kids have other people in their lives they bond with. It's natural to be jealous, but you don't punish the other caretakers for your jealousy.", "NTA. You are right: your mom should be included in at least some family outings, if nothing else than as thanks for caring for your children while you and your wife are at work. It sounds like your wife is jealous of her relationship with your children. They spend most of their days with her so of course they are going to gravitate toward grandma. That\u2019s the trade off that comes with child care provided by a loving family member. Excluding your mom from your fun family outings does nothing other than hurt your mom. It doesn\u2019t improve your wife\u2019s relationship with her children, either.\n\nIf your wife refuses to plan outings for all 3 adults with the children, you need to start doing so, and plan well in advance so as not to conflict with anything your wife has already planned.

Make it a 'standing' day, like the 1st Sunday of the month, and the rest of the weekends are for your wife/kids and you both as a family.\n\nI can't imagine being so adamant on excluding my recently widowed MIL though, who is likely in the depth of deep grieving, it's a sacrifice you wife should make to the woman who by her own words is raising her children.  \n\nAgain, don't know if grandma is being compensated or not, if she is not, even MORE reason to pay it back by including and paying for her to be on the fun events.  Another choice is yes, giving a funds gift for grandma to do something once a week that is fun with her and the kids  Example Friday Icecream or movie after school...or an aquarium or zoo pass.  My mom always found fun/cheap things to do w/my sons when she babysat them, but often the library was something they all enjoyed doing and it was free.  \n\nYour wife has valid point, but your mother is grieving her life partner and compromise needs to happen for your trusted/relied on babysitter ;)  and YOU can be the one to make it happen, but take the planning off your wife's plate.", "YTA, why can't Grandma take them on \"fun things\" when she has them?", "YTA - don\u2019t leave it all on your wife to find and plan fun outings with the kids.

YTA", "I wonder what would happen if mom decided to stop babysitting. So Mom should have to pay for the kids fun time and she's babysitting them, and maybe if the parents actually spent time with the kids the kids wouldn't run to Grandma when she's around. Mom sounds almost like a Disney  parent, Grandma you do all the heavy lifting and stuff during the week and I'll do all the fun stuff without you on the weekends. And if the sun started planning outings for just Mom and the kids and him the wife won't get upset and feel like she's being excluded\n\nNah\n\nBut there needs to be some compromise", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re wife is kind of taking advantage of the situation by relying on your mom for babysitting but refusing to include her otherwise.\n\nGrandmas putting in the work, she should get to have some of the fun too!

Why are you trying to alienate your wife?", "NTA\n\nI get that your wife is keen to spend time with your kids but occasionally sharing a fun activity with your mum -- especially after your father's recent death -- would be good for everyone.

Hell, what\u2019s stopping you planning one and inviting her? If your wife does all the planning then she\u2019s in charge of who\u2019s going , simple.

But she's your mother, not your wifes who already works long hours. You need to take the responsibility with planning. Take your kids and mom out to dinner or another activity on a weeknight before your wife gets home or offer your wife a completely free day once a month where you organize something with the kids and your mom.\n\nYTA btw", "Not sure if this is exactly right, but it seems from the description your wife is in the medical field and works 10-11 hours a day, at least 5 days a week.  Maybe she takes call some weekends?  I\u2019m guessing there are a lot of feelings involved.  She wants to spend more time with the kids, and this is a way to make special memories that she otherwise doesn\u2019t get to have during the week.  Only 9 more years with the older, maybe missed a lot of both kids\u2019 childhood.  I would guess that those outings are very special, and she puts a lot of time, thought and effort into planning them. \n\nHer issue with your mom coming might be multi factorial.  Yes, of course she wants to spend time with the kids and being ignored in favor of your parents by the kids doesn\u2019t seem like it achieves the mission.  Perhaps she also is burned out, feeling guilty about not being more available to the kids, resentful that someone else has that opportunity (even if it\u2019s helpful\u2026feelings are more complicated than that).  \n\nI would suggest doing something in between.  Like having a once a month family dinner where you order in, make it really easy, open a bottle of wine and let the kids have movie night, game night or something fun to create the opportunity for new happy fun memories with grandma.  Or go out to eat?  Or plan something with your parents when the wife is on call?  Whatever you plan, just be cognizant of making it easier on your wife.  Then maybe when it doesn\u2019t feel so one-sided, maybe she would be more open to more integrated events.  Maybe not.  Either way; she has a fair request which doesn\u2019t necessarily make you \u201cwrong\u201d but as someone wise told me, you can be right or you can be happy.  \n\nAnd yes to some earlier comments you made/asked, family event planning can and should be a team sport.  It doesn\u2019t have to be so rigid (ie you plan events only for your family) but when feelings are there like that, you may not have yet reached the real underlying issue.\n\nEdited to vote: NAH", "Raging YTA, why don\u2019t you plan something or put in actual effort?

They are not entitled to every fun day of their grandchildren\u2019s lives. Parents need time establishing memories with their own children alone. It\u2019s really really hard for a lot of people to accept that, especially when they see their own parents feeling disappointment. You have to remember that your wife became your most immediate family and thus your most immediate concern the day you got married.

Unfortunately, she no longer has parents to include, **yet she\u2019s still the planner.** If you want activities for everyone, ***then you plan them! The cadence doesn\u2019t matter!!! You could do something daily, IF you plan things.***", "Did both of your parents work? Did your parents get ample time alone with you? You can\u2019t raise your children based on how exactly you were raised. The world is very different and parenting and time management is very different nowadays.", "Also I get the vibe that he thinks his mum should be invited by default?? I would not be onboard with that.", "> Mentioning her deceased parents was also a low blow. A REALLY low blow.\n\nAnd that might be why she's no longer inviting MIL.  Before, she would likely think to make plans with her parents and would think \"Oh, I bet my in-laws would like to join too!  I'll invite them!\".  \n\nNow, it's probably just too painful to think about planning events with the grandparents because it's a reminder that her parents aren't around.  It's a gut punch, and she tries to avoid it.  The easiest way to avoid it is to not think about it, and that means she doesn't think about MIL either.  She just plans events for her family.\n\nMy dad says \"You're always too young to become an orphan\".  And that man didn't become an orphan until he was in his 60s.  But the loss of your parents is something you don't get over so much as just a load you learn to live with as time passes.  This is how she's living with her loss, and it's not terrible.  Just mildly inconvenient for OP.", "Yeaaah... For an hour and a half in the evening...\n\nI don't know, if his mom is a widow now, treating her JUST as a nanny and \"come to work\" and ''go back home you're not needed anymore\" is very cold and heartless to me.\n\nI'm with OP on this that once in a blue moon as you Yanks would say she could tag along, leave the house for some fun with the kids and her son and dil, feel like more then free of charge nanny, so what?", "Seriously I would of lost it. He's very fortunate to have a nice woman like OP.", "Whoa.  Where did my wife carrying the shoulder load come from?  That's a pretty big assumption. Yes she works a lot of hours indeed but I'm not sitting around.  I get the kids up and ready for school,  make them breakfast, prepare their school lunches, make dinner for the whole family, get them ready for bed and put them to sleep.  And after the kids are asleep I  work remotely to make up for not being able to put in a full 8 hours at the office.  That's 5 days a week.", "Workload for everything?  C\u2019mon.  It feels like you just made up a narrative to fit your opinion.", "My husband pulled the adoption card and I laughed at him in a fight. Then went on to tell him that his mom couldn't even bother to get her daughter out of state care while she had the audacity to only get the him. He shut up real quick.", "It's a huge mental load to plan things.  You have to know what everyone in your party enjoys, doesn't enjoy, and what are their dealbreakers.  You have to research.  You have to make the plans.  You have to get everyone/everything ready to go.  \n\nI love to plan things, but I am very clear that I do it *at my leisure*.  It is work that *I* can choose to do, but it is a much bigger ask if someone is asking me to do it *on their behalf*.  And I don't plan things that aren't fun for me to plan.  Because it's a lot of work if I'm not enjoying it.  \n\nOP can plan his own damn family events if he wants to.  It's not a skill that requires a second X chromosome, it's a skill that requires practice and an adult brain.  This is something he can *choose* to take on if he wants his kids to get to do more with grandma.  But he doesn't get to shove that work onto someone else's plate when they aren't willing to take it on.  \n\nWife likes to plan things for HER to do with her family only. I get it.  It's a lot less work when you're just planning things for your own household.  OP can be the one to plan things to include his family.", "He also clearly said she already goes on family vacations and plenty of other events. \n\nDefinitely reasonable on the wife\u2019s part to want a few small events on weekends with her immediate family.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking too. In my opinion, it feels like he\u2019s exaggerating/lying/leaving info out when it comes to certain things so it can fit his narrative. I just think he wanted to justify his reason for not planning things with his own mother", "She isnt sad and lonely, shes married to OPs stepdad and had been since OP was 10", "It seems to or a daily theme of people (you and OP) who refuse to understand that just because someone is sad and lonely it doesn\u2019t mean they get to cross other people\u2019s boundaries. \n\nJust because grandma is sad doesn\u2019t mean wife has to include grandma in her planned activities she wants to do with her own kids.", "Nobody's arguing that. But OP can easily solve that by planning *his own outings* that include his mother. Nobody is stopping him from doing that. His wife only plans things once every few weeks. OP is leveraging her labor, co-opting events designed for another purpose and refusing to do his own work to include his mother.", "I agree, and I'm so sorry her husband recently died (mine died 3 years ago), but if she wants to do fun events, why isn't she doing them in the time she is with the kids?", "I don't know, when my mother would drive me to school we'd have nice conversations. She wasn't always a good mom but those are some of the nicer memories I have of my childhood.\n\nIt's not always about how much time you spend or what activity you do, sometimes it's just about being there together. And judging by your other comments of how much the kids love their grandma, it seems like she's doing just fine in that department. \n\nDon't underestimate small moments, sometimes they're the most precious.", "Your mother already spends more time with the kids than your wife get to and she is their actual effing mother. Take a day off every few months and plan something for a weekday so you don\u2019t take bonding time with your wife.", "Kindly, YTA. You, yourself, have specifically stated that your mom sees the kids more than your wife during the week. You've also said the kids would ignore her(and you) in favor of their grandma for group events. Your wife has made it very clear that her primary goal with these special events is bonding with her children. Your intention to be inclusive to your mother is directly EXCLUDING your wife. Even if that is not your intention, your wife knows that would be the impact. You know that would be the impact, you've already admitted it. You need to recognize that. That during these specific bonding events, your attempts to be inclusive to your own mother is excluding your children's mother from having her own bonding time with them.\n\nAnd just as your parents won't be around forever, neither will you or your wife. These little years will fly by, and you already know she has precious little time to experience these precious little moments during the week. Why are you trying to reduce and diminish what time she does have?

She is capable.", "He wrote in the post that his wife\u2019s planned events occur once or twice a month. This is not frequent. There is plenty of time for him to plan something else at a different time. \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s just lazy. His wife is \u201cso excellent at coming up with activities\u201d so she should just share her planned outings instead of forcing him to put in the effort to plan something himself.", "As a mother with a career that I love I also feel that you can\u2019t completely disregard the fact that OPs wife probably feels that she is missing out on motherhood a bit, even if she feels her career is meaningful and rewarding, and that the MIL as helpful as she is is also usurping her a bit as mother. \n\nSo the outings that she plans are for her to build her own mothering bonds with the children, and that would be totally undermined if MIL was there. Because she knows in her heart of hearts that everyday presence trumps grand gestures, and MIL has the advantage there. And that sort of sucks.", "OP clarified that she's not a widow - she's been with OP's stepdad since OP was ten, and it's his biological father who died.", "It's certainly reasonable to invite granny along sometimes, and OP even admitted that his mom \\*is\\* invited when it's a bigger family occasion. What isn't reasonable is demanding that his wife has to still do all the work to arrange family events that \\*must\\* include his mom, at the expense of what little time she gets to spend with her own kids.", "I think the objection is more that OP is trying to invite his mom along to events his wife plans. If OP was planning events, he could invite his mom, but he's leaving all of the event planning to his wife and just trying to piggyback off of her work.", "No one is treating her like a nanny, and is there any particular reason that OP can't plan some activities with his mom and children or their whole family?", "Right ....

It doesn't mean you and your mother do nothing, and it's wonderful that you two have that time every day to work together, as well as bond with each other and the kids.\n\nBut, it does mean that your wife is organizing things for these events. And, it clearly means a lot to her to have those opportunities to bond with her kids (and, perhaps, also with you) because she's NOT able to be there for all the stuff you are describing since she's working so much. That is her chance to have time with her husband and two children as a family.\n\nThe point that comment was making is that, if you want to have your mother come with you all once a month or every couple months (or whatever you and your wife agree on), *you* should be the one to plan it so it's *your* activity and also make it an opportunity for your wife to relax. This would also perhaps make it more appealing to your wife to give up some of that that special dedicated time.", "It\u2019s probably the part where you have 1001 reasons why you can\u2019t possibly plan an outing for everyone instead of expecting her to do it.\n\nI\u2019m confused though, if you\u2019re home to do all the morning stuff and leave work early enough that you have hours to make up every night why is your mom putting in so much childcare?", "And what about the other two days?

It's a common arrangement especially if grandparent isn't working and needs the socialization. \nHell, the woman is complaining about *not seeing them enough*. \n\nLet's say for arguments sake, they do owe her. It's not up to mom only to give away her free time. It's dad's mom after all.  You're placing all the burden on mom when it comes to oweing grandma and childcare duties. \n\nSounds like mom is the breadwinner working 10 hour shifts, or at least bringing up a not-insignificant portion of the bills.  Are you suggesting she stop working and let the entire family suffer? How are they going to pay their bills?\n\nAlso, if they're children - its up to the adults to set healthy boundaries.

I agree with you there.  But why does OP's *wife* have to take on the work of planning for that?
