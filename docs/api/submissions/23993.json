So I went to karaoke with my \"on a break\" girlfriend, but we decided to remain friends while we decide our lives.  We have discussed in the past how she becomes obnoxious and abusive while drunk, I have told her I didn't want to hang out with her while she was drunk in the past. \n\nBut I agreed to go to karaoke with her. She got wasted, flirted with some people there, karaoke ended. She wanted to go to another bar, so we walked over. Along the way she kept telling me to go home, and she didn't need a babysitter. I told her not everything was about her, and I wanted to go to sing more songs. \n\nWe get there, and she tries making out with me and I push her away. She was sloppy drunk, smelled like beer, and I HATE PDA. She sings her song  and then she tells me she wants to go home. I am singing next so I ask her to wait. She waits while I finish my song, and  I later call an uber. The uber comes and I go up to her and tell her our uber is here. She tells me to eff off, and everyone at the bar wants to eff her, and I am lucky that she ever wanted to eff me. Again I tell her it's time to go home, and she made a disgusted face and said \"I'm not going with you.\" So I left. \n\nI was pretty mad, so I wrote some texts saying \"goodnight\" and \"have fun effing the entire bar.\" \n\n2 hours later she called me and told me she is done with me for leaving a drunk person alone at the bar. I don't live far from the bar, so I took an uber to the bar to collect her, she was gone. \n\nHere is some info. \n\n1. she is 42 years old. \n2. She often goes ALONE to that bar, and to that one in particular. She is a regular there, and the bartenders and karaoke hosts know her. \n3. I feel like she is an adult, she knows I don't like it when she drinks too much yet she trampled those boundaries anyways. \n4. She is very abusive when she drinks.

You called an Uber after *she said she wanted to leave* and you planned to leave with her. When you told her it was there, suddenly she wanted to stay and gets abusive telling you to eff off.

The next day she always \u201cdidn\u2019t remember\u201d and used that as an excuse. I finally had to distance myself after the last altercation and it\u2019s been a year and I still haven\u2019t gotten an apology.

You need to be kind to yourself, and make this a not on a break, but absolutely over relationship. IMO it seems pretty likely you are still in love with this person, and went along with their suggestion to take a break. It happens. I\u2019ve been willing to accept behavior that I\u2019d never let friends get away with from their partners. Just remember it takes TWO people, willing to make an effort, for a relationship to work.

It keeps their self loathing at bay and that means they don\u2019t have to face the reality of their addiction and how much it\u2019s hurting those around them.  Then they can keep drinking, in denial of everything.  Alcohol is the worst drug.", "NTA and as I read thru the post I assumed I was reading about a girl of 20 or younger, boy was I surprised.

She\u2019s a full grown woman who by now should have learned how to handle her alcohol when George Bush was still dodging shoes. The fact she\u2019s a regular there makes it even worse. Those bartenders either love her for her large drunken tips or can\u2019t stand her if she acts like that regularly. \n\nSecondly, you stated you\u2019re on a break so you both can figure your life out. Sounds to me like she made her decision for the both of you by saying the whole place would sleep with her. You sound like you\u2019re done with her based off your tone in this. As you rightfully should be.\n\nLastly, you say she\u2019s abusive when she drinks. I would say she\u2019s emotionally abusing you as well. She KNOWS you don\u2019t like her getting like that, but she clearly does it anyways. She\u2019s not just twisting the knife in your wound, she\u2019s licking the blood off of it and realizing she wants a chainsaw instead. You both know who each other is at this point. \n\nMake like the Good Shepherd and get the flock outta there.", "Nta, you set boundaries. She stomped all over them.

If we tried to create the reddest set of flags possible for one sentence this would be a top competitor. \n\nTime to grow up and realize you are either together or not. The on break thing is a game for teenagers and maybe college students.

Lets not play the 'on a break' game. Its over, you both have license to bone others and its not healthy.

Yeah thats just so unbelievably dumb. Cut contact.", "YTA to yourself for staying in contact with someone who clearly has deep contempt for you. Block this person please.", "YTA - You should have cut her out of your life a long time ago, but you decided to \u201cstay friends\u201d which includes looking out for a friend when they are a belligerent drunk and their judgement is impaired. Don\u2019t like it? Stop hanging out with her and especially when you know she might get drunk (which sounds like all the time because she might be an alcoholic)!!!!!", "ESH Her for being a sloppy, irresponsible drunk and you for continuing to spend time with her knowing how abusive she is. Don't contact this person anymore. You deserve better.", "Yes, YTA. Because you waste you life & time with this abusive bitch. Every moment you spend with her is more abuse you willfully subject yourself to. 42yo? She's not gonna change her behavior. Maybe you should change yours.", "Yta", "Hi, you did tell her in advance but you also went to the bar with her so it\u2019s mixed messages. I think you need to be more clear like \u201cif you drink I will leave you in the bar\u201d.

I will leave you there and then if you do\u201d. Whatever she choose to do is her choice but you clarified what she can expect from you if she decides to take such a choice.
