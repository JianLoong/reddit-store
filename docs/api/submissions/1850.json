It's been a long time, and a lot of things have happened. I think it's finally gotten to the point where I can post an update that many of you asked for. I'll do shortest update to longest update.\n\nThe dress: many of you reached out and offered to try and help, and I'm so thankful to you. I couldn't respond to everyone, but thank you so much. As some of you suggested, Gpa used pieces of the original dress to make accessories for my sister to wear, and she loved them. She'll still wear some of the hair ties for special occasions. My aunt was able to make an almost perfect replica of the dress for the wedding, so while it wasn't the same, it was close.\n\nMy sister: she did have to go to the hospital to treat her crohns flare up. It was terrifying, and since she was immuno-compromised she did catch C19. I was so scared I was going to lose my baby sister, but thankfully she pulled through. She is now finally married to her wonderful wife. My ex and I tried to have C pay for the hospital bills, but my sister refused to take the money. They do have good insurance, luckily. SIL was still pissed and torn about having C at the wedding, but my sister insisted. C wasn't part of the wedding party, but she was still invited and joined their special day. While it's not forgotten or really forgiven, my sister is willing to move on, at least.\n\nFinally, C. I think seeing her aunt so sick did help kickstart C realizing how wrong she'd been, since it was a domino effect of her actions in the first place that started all of this. She herself admitted in therapy it was her jealousy over having to buy a wedding dress in the future instead of having one made for her like it was done for my sister. She does still struggle with her anger at times, but it is getting better. It turns out she used to get all her anger and aggression in sports at school with her friends, which is why she seemed so calm all other times, but being in lockdown just forced everything to build up in an unhealthy way. Still not an excuse for what happened, but at least an explanation.\n\nAs I said in an update last time, my ex and I are paying for college for whatever scholarships C doesn't get, so at the time taking the 12k for the dress seemed right. I do still stand by that. But after seeing how much she's worked on herself and on trying to repair things with my sister, I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills. She's also been working with my aunt and Gpa one day a week as well as editing other's essays to build back up her fun money. I matched 50%, and gave it to her when she graduated. She started college in the fall with a few scholarships, and is continuing therapy. Things are still tedious with her and my sister, but they're working on it. C has been trying hard, shown she really is sorry, and is trying to fix things. I still think we have a while to go, but we'll get there.", "created_utc": 1667961059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq64ky/update_aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she/", "score": 1546, "replies": ["I didn\u2019t see your original post until just now.

And just because you don't personally witness what happens at their homes when you aren't there, doesn't mean it's not happening.", "I also know how easy it is to tell when sm1 is hiding something like that, I\u2019ve dealt with it too but it\u2019s absolutely juvenile to act on it at that age.", "It is juvenile, but at 16 you're still part juvenile.  It takes experience, wisdom, and often therapy to realize which parts of yourself need to change and to figure out how to effectively do so \n\nAs far as being easy to tell, you're fooling yourself.  People hide drug/alcohol abuse from their families all the time, and those have physical indicators.  I know multiple people that hid entire second families until sometime after a secret child arrived.  Throwing tantrums around your family but not around your friends isn't even something that requires hiding because there are no signs.  \n\nYou are overconfident in your ability to know what's in other people's heads", "NTA,  initially, but y-t-a for giving her the money back and matching her earnings by 50%. She's working to build up her fun money again, but she should have to keep working while in school to really have it ingrained in her mind what she did and the consequences she brought on herself", "I think you did everything right but I have one question. Why would your daughter have to pay her medical bills on top of everything thing else?", "She should be thankful how it turned out because honestly what she did was unforgivable. I would never want to see her ever again. She knew exactly what she was doing and she didn\u2019t care about anyone but herself. People like that rarely change so be careful", "I remember reading the original post and being haunted that someone so young was capable of planning and acting out such a deliberately vindictive act from malice. So to read you handed her back 3k and then matched her funds on top of that for doing the bare minimum of attending therapy, working hard and making amends is a shock. Your daughter clearly already had a strong work ethic and knew the value of a dollar. That was never the issue. Making her earn back every cent of that 15k would have at least been a sobering reminder for her of why she lost it in the first place. \n\nYour sister sounds like a really empathetic person. Of course she was going to override her wife and not accept the 3k, not ask for payment of medical bills, not press charges and insist on C still attending the wedding. Frankly it was for you & your co-parent to step in and enforce severe consequences on C. Sadly it sounds like you both chose to further indulge C rather than seize this last chance to impress upon C how serious this was to guide her into an adult who would never do something like this. C wasn't the only young person with mental health and anger issues who struggled during lockdown. The way you & your co-parent have so easily accepted this as a valid excuse makes C sound spoilt.", "What a sufficient cat", "I remember this post well. I feel horrible for everything the sister went through - mentally, emotionally and physically. She also sounds like a lovely, gracious and forgiving woman.\n\nHappy to hear the daughter has taken accountability for her actions and has seemingly been commited to tackling her demons so that she can grow as a person.", "Fellow axe thrower fist bump.", "She does know she was wrong. The jealousy was just part of the reason why. She never said she was right, never said she should have done it, but yes, she was jealous, and that was wrong.", "Thank you for the tip! She does still do virtual sessions with her therapist, but I'll mention this to her as well. See if perhaps she's open to having peers too.", "My sister and I were raised by our parents before they passed that love was unconditional. And while this tested that, it proved true. She was a child. A mentally ill child. A mentally ill child living through a major global crisis. We're not going to punish her for the rest of her life for giving in to her illness. We supported her, got her the help she needed, and while she does still have a lot to make up for to my sister, she's being given the chance. To do the kind of punishment you suggested is just cruel and vindictive, helping no one.", "She was a child. A mentally ill child. A mentally ill child living in the middle of a major global crisis after just losing a family member who loved her. She didn't kill someone, of course we were going to try and make her better. The idea that I could just easily abandon my minor child so easily is juat awful. She paid for it, and does continue to pay for it in her own way.", "\u201cbut look at the type of person you\u2019re supporting\u201d\n\nDid you forget that this is their daughter? This is horrible, but it\u2019s hardly in disownment territory.", "Where are you getting 20,000? She has a little under 9, including what I matched. Fun money is for eating out at places that don't take her meal plan, doing club activities, buying clothes, video games, non-course related books, being an actual person over the next 4 years.", "she caused the stress which created the medical episode and put her in the hospital?", "I was at a fascinating talk about anger in teenaged hirls. They brought up a couple of interesting points which included: women not having healthy outlets for anger, being socialized to suppress rather than confront, and the onset of the realization that life is different as a developing woman. \n\nThe summary of it was that developing teenaged girls have a lot of legitimate things to be angry about and no good way to express that anger. They thought it might be the explanation for the \"mean girl\" behaviour that is often seen in young women.", "Comment partially stolen from [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq64ky/update_aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she/ivnt4ag?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3).\n\nu/ZealousidealLoss1580 is a comment stealing bot.", "I'd believe that if she hadn't cut up the dress, that's not something you do when you get stuck in clothes she could have waited and been fine Instead she chose to cut it it wasn't an accident it was purposeful and spiteful.\n\nI'm not saying the punishment wasn't enough though the punishment was appropriate.", "Just be conscious your not labelling it all the fault of mental illness and sweeping it under the rug. I don't know how to write this well and i fear its going to come off all wrong, but it can be very easy to compartmentalise and view it as mental illness and not your daughter. It sounds like you have built a very thick wall separating your daughter from her actions. Your daughter did this and while she is an adult now I'd still be keeping a close eye on her. What she did was evil, put in the same situation would history repeat itself? What happens next time she is jealous or stressed, does she have better coping mechanisms? Did she realise it was easy to just blame it on lockdown etc to take the heat off of her and went with it?", "The punishment the other commentator suggested is OTT. But you didn't mention getting your daughter into anger management classes, separate from the therapy. Essentially because money is important to C, the previous post & this post made that clear, of course she continued her hard work to earn it back. Maintaining her work ethic and trying to make amends with your sister meant you returned 3k + 50% of the original 12k you took.\n\nYou essentially rewarded her for her bad behaviour. Via rewarding her for making amends. Instead of teaching C making amends for our unforgivable behaviour without any expectation of anything is what we do if you want to be a better person today than you were yesterday. Not to put too fine of a point on it but your sister forever lost a precious item and almost lost her life because your daughter felt jealous so planned a vindictive act. Her only punishment was losing 6k she's easily been able to reearn. She even got to attend the wedding. Even having to earn back the entire 12k, every penny/cent would have served as a sobering reminder of why it was lost.\n\nWith such lack of impactful consequences for such behaviour, it won't be surprising if something like this happens again.", "Man, I wish I had you as a dad growing up. We're around the same age and seeing you be the best kind of parent is refreshing. \n\nThis was a major learning experience for everyone. And you handled it the best way possible and now you are trying to move past it. \nNo one can grow if the constantly have their mistakes thrown in their face. Especially mistakes made during a mental health crisis. During a global health crisis. Keep being the good parents you are. Hopefully C and sis can have a heart to heart one day.", "so you contributed 2/3 of that $9000 after you returned the money your sister wouldn't take for the medical bills, and matched what your daughter saved?", "you clearly have better control over your emotions bc it\u2019s not that hard to imagine cutting up a dress in jealousy.  you\u2019re forgetting a key component: she was also angry.  if she\u2019s like me or what I\u2019m thinking she\u2019s like: she could have become so jealous, it made her angry and then in a fit of anger, ripped the dress off.  I can believe it.\n\nnot necessarily accidental but also not necessarily the deliberate act of malice you\u2019re thinking.", "I destroyed my own cell phone--a flip phone--with my bare hands as a teenage girl who didn't do sports. I wasn't really intending to, but I pulled it apart.", "I appreciate you being honest and sharing your story, thank you. 8)", "She did lost the 12k. C currently has a little under 9k, including what I matched. If she hadn't lost the 12k, then when she graduated she would have had 21k, not the 9 she currently has.", "When I was younger (also BPD!) there were times I would get so angry at my parents (particularly my stepdad) that I just had this primal NEED to see something shatter.\n\nI didn't do it because I was actually terrified of my stepdad (who is definitely guilty of emotional and mental abuse) but not fulfilling that need to see something break led to me feeling even worse and even though I stopped banging my head on things at about eleven I was tearing myself apart mentally. It all came to a head in a big nasty end myself attempt that didn't work (I took excessive amounts of everything in our medicine cabinet and went to bed expecting to die at least semi peacefully in my sleep, and ended up vomiting all over myself while I was unconscious and waking up covered in puke and alive.)\n\nBPD can really fuck you up. My mom didn't know about the end myself attempt until literally eight years later and I don't think she actually believes I did it.", "That's great that YOU wouldn't react that way, but not everyone is you. People are giving you their real stories, sharing things about themselves, to help you understand. Saying \"Well I never would do that!\" shows that you aren't trying to understand another perspective, and is a little rude to the people being honest with you about themselves.", "I hope you're doing better nowadays! This must have been terrible. The whirlwind of emotions and not knowing how to understand them yourself. Stay strong!", "Oh yeah. Nowadays it's mostly the anxiety and depression that eat at me. I've had a mantra to my family the last few years whenever something goes wrong with my brain and I can't do something/go somewhere/etc and that's 'i am sick. The brain is an organ like any other.
