{"id": 1850, "submission_id": "yq64ky", "title": "Update: AITA For \"Ruining\" my kid's life after she ruined a dress?", "selftext": "Hey everyone. It's been a long time, and a lot of things have happened. I think it's finally gotten to the point where I can post an update that many of you asked for. I'll do shortest update to longest update.\n\nThe dress: many of you reached out and offered to try and help, and I'm so thankful to you. I couldn't respond to everyone, but thank you so much. As some of you suggested, Gpa used pieces of the original dress to make accessories for my sister to wear, and she loved them. She'll still wear some of the hair ties for special occasions. My aunt was able to make an almost perfect replica of the dress for the wedding, so while it wasn't the same, it was close.\n\nMy sister: she did have to go to the hospital to treat her crohns flare up. It was terrifying, and since she was immuno-compromised she did catch C19. I was so scared I was going to lose my baby sister, but thankfully she pulled through. She is now finally married to her wonderful wife. My ex and I tried to have C pay for the hospital bills, but my sister refused to take the money. They do have good insurance, luckily. SIL was still pissed and torn about having C at the wedding, but my sister insisted. C wasn't part of the wedding party, but she was still invited and joined their special day. While it's not forgotten or really forgiven, my sister is willing to move on, at least.\n\nFinally, C. I think seeing her aunt so sick did help kickstart C realizing how wrong she'd been, since it was a domino effect of her actions in the first place that started all of this. She herself admitted in therapy it was her jealousy over having to buy a wedding dress in the future instead of having one made for her like it was done for my sister. She does still struggle with her anger at times, but it is getting better. It turns out she used to get all her anger and aggression in sports at school with her friends, which is why she seemed so calm all other times, but being in lockdown just forced everything to build up in an unhealthy way. Still not an excuse for what happened, but at least an explanation.\n\nAs I said in an update last time, my ex and I are paying for college for whatever scholarships C doesn't get, so at the time taking the 12k for the dress seemed right. I do still stand by that. But after seeing how much she's worked on herself and on trying to repair things with my sister, I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills. She's also been working with my aunt and Gpa one day a week as well as editing other's essays to build back up her fun money. I matched 50%, and gave it to her when she graduated. She started college in the fall with a few scholarships, and is continuing therapy. Things are still tedious with her and my sister, but they're working on it. C has been trying hard, shown she really is sorry, and is trying to fix things. I still think we have a while to go, but we'll get there.", "created_utc": 1667961059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq64ky/update_aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she/", "score": 246, "replies": ["I didn\u2019t see your original post until just now. As a child with a seamstress for a mother I am devastated that your sister didn\u2019t get to wear the original dress. Im glad that your family was able to make a replica and accessories for your sisters day. I am also glad that your family is slowly healing in multiple ways from this incident. If your daughter doesn\u2019t play sports anymore going to the gym and axe throwing are great ways to safely release any anger. I go to the gym everyday (mostly) and if I am having a really bad day I go axe throwing because I can put a lot of rage into the throwing and no one will judge me.", "[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hfhlrg/aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she_ruined_a/)", ">I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills.

That kid your describing sounds entitled and mean but it was nice to read she had enough self awareness to name her own traits. That was all round heartbreaking and I think you handled it well. I genuinely hope C has learned a lesson but tbh I don\u2019t believe that empathy can be learned.", "Lockdown was an awful time for everyone, but for teens who lost their usual options for coping with outsized emotions, it was especially rough. Combined with the grief of loss, and the lack of maturity (which only comes with age and time)\u2026 Well, there was a lot during lockdown that didn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI am glad your daughter has taken responsibility. I would have been furious with her too. But I can see the possibility of her handling that disappointment poorly, yet still being able to grow and become a better and more empathetic person. I\u2019m glad your family is healing, and that your daughter has access to therapy that is helpful to her. The update is appreciated.

It really just sounds like your sister is being a bit of a pushover about this cuz she's just trying to move on and she knows that you and your ex will still try to pick up the slack for your kid. Like, I'm glad that C it's starting to put in the work to improve, but what she did is unforgivable and just so horrible.

I have figured out how to manage my anger and I am blessed to be able to comfortably live on my own. I have learned to recognize that in reality all of these things are tiny and no one is doing it purposely to piss me off, except my brother. As for the 16 year old, grief can be weird and she just lost a very talented great grandma in what seems to be a very tight knit family.", "This is the key question.", "Uhhhhhh.... Hormones? Mental illness that can flare up at that age? Different brain chemistry (ADHD, etc) that can turn excess energy into anger? \n\nThere's SO MANY reasons, and rage at that age is fairly 'normal' to a degree.

I still remember being horrified at C's selfishness, and heartbroken for your sister. After what happened, she is a saint for being willing to try and overcome this situation. (And a better person than I am, as I don't know if I would have been able to move past it.) I think all of your actions towards your daughter were absolutely appropriate, and I applaud you for not trying to cover up or excuse what your daughter did, and also addressing her issues through therapy. The world needs more parents like you.", "Your daughter is really, really lucky to have you and your relatives as family. I hope that she's learned to channel her anger less destructively or at least found an outlet that lets her blow off steam without hurting other people in the process.

At my university they have groups for specific issues at the counseling center.

My mom's rage was a mental illness. We have no clue which one and I really think my mom should go to therapy but she's on an antidepressant because of sciatic nerve pain. Apparently pain and depression follow the same neural pathways in the brain and shes actually a nice person now.
