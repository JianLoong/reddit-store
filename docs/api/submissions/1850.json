It's been a long time, and a lot of things have happened. I think it's finally gotten to the point where I can post an update that many of you asked for. I'll do shortest update to longest update.\n\nThe dress: many of you reached out and offered to try and help, and I'm so thankful to you. I couldn't respond to everyone, but thank you so much. As some of you suggested, Gpa used pieces of the original dress to make accessories for my sister to wear, and she loved them. She'll still wear some of the hair ties for special occasions. My aunt was able to make an almost perfect replica of the dress for the wedding, so while it wasn't the same, it was close.\n\nMy sister: she did have to go to the hospital to treat her crohns flare up. It was terrifying, and since she was immuno-compromised she did catch C19. I was so scared I was going to lose my baby sister, but thankfully she pulled through. She is now finally married to her wonderful wife. My ex and I tried to have C pay for the hospital bills, but my sister refused to take the money. They do have good insurance, luckily. SIL was still pissed and torn about having C at the wedding, but my sister insisted. C wasn't part of the wedding party, but she was still invited and joined their special day. While it's not forgotten or really forgiven, my sister is willing to move on, at least.\n\nFinally, C. I think seeing her aunt so sick did help kickstart C realizing how wrong she'd been, since it was a domino effect of her actions in the first place that started all of this. She herself admitted in therapy it was her jealousy over having to buy a wedding dress in the future instead of having one made for her like it was done for my sister. She does still struggle with her anger at times, but it is getting better. It turns out she used to get all her anger and aggression in sports at school with her friends, which is why she seemed so calm all other times, but being in lockdown just forced everything to build up in an unhealthy way. Still not an excuse for what happened, but at least an explanation.\n\nAs I said in an update last time, my ex and I are paying for college for whatever scholarships C doesn't get, so at the time taking the 12k for the dress seemed right. I do still stand by that. But after seeing how much she's worked on herself and on trying to repair things with my sister, I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills. She's also been working with my aunt and Gpa one day a week as well as editing other's essays to build back up her fun money. I matched 50%, and gave it to her when she graduated. She started college in the fall with a few scholarships, and is continuing therapy. Things are still tedious with her and my sister, but they're working on it. C has been trying hard, shown she really is sorry, and is trying to fix things. I still think we have a while to go, but we'll get there.", "created_utc": 1667961059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq64ky/update_aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she/", "score": 769, "replies": ["I didn\u2019t see your original post until just now. As a child with a seamstress for a mother I am devastated that your sister didn\u2019t get to wear the original dress.

If your daughter doesn\u2019t play sports anymore going to the gym and axe throwing are great ways to safely release any anger. I go to the gym everyday (mostly) and if I am having a really bad day I go axe throwing because I can put a lot of rage into the throwing and no one will judge me.", "[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hfhlrg/aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she_ruined_a/)", ">I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills.

That kid your describing sounds entitled and mean but it was nice to read she had enough self awareness to name her own traits. That was all round heartbreaking and I think you handled it well. I genuinely hope C has learned a lesson but tbh I don\u2019t believe that empathy can be learned.", "Lockdown was an awful time for everyone, but for teens who lost their usual options for coping with outsized emotions, it was especially rough. Combined with the grief of loss, and the lack of maturity (which only comes with age and time)\u2026 Well, there was a lot during lockdown that didn\u2019t make sense. \n\nI am glad your daughter has taken responsibility. I would have been furious with her too. But I can see the possibility of her handling that disappointment poorly, yet still being able to grow and become a better and more empathetic person.

I have learned to recognize that in reality all of these things are tiny and no one is doing it purposely to piss me off, except my brother.

Mental illness that can flare up at that age? Different brain chemistry (ADHD, etc) that can turn excess energy into anger? \n\nThere's SO MANY reasons, and rage at that age is fairly 'normal' to a degree.

I still remember being horrified at C's selfishness, and heartbroken for your sister. After what happened, she is a saint for being willing to try and overcome this situation. (And a better person than I am, as I don't know if I would have been able to move past it.) I think all of your actions towards your daughter were absolutely appropriate, and I applaud you for not trying to cover up or excuse what your daughter did, and also addressing her issues through therapy.

At my university they have groups for specific issues at the counseling center.

My mom's rage was a mental illness. We have no clue which one and I really think my mom should go to therapy but she's on an antidepressant because of sciatic nerve pain.

She needs to understand her weight relative to someone else whose clothes she may want to wear. We all have an image of ourselves when we look in the mirror.

I would have taken the rest of the money and put it towards something special for my sis.  A vacation, extra spoiling time on her honeymoon, something, but she would not be getting it back.

Unfortunately, for me I can say, when I got angry about something not fitting back then, I'd actually sometimes destroy the clothes.

BPD is a very resentful and hateful mental disorder, whilst with addition of being able to understand feelings amazingly, if your problem behavior is anger, what the girl did is something I might have done. Not for her reasons, but out of pure hate and anger.\n\nI didn't do it the reasons she did (my goal was just to destroy the item that \"annoyed\" me), but it might have been something similar but with the addition of resentment on the girls side.\n\nDoesn't make it right what she did, but it's important to me that even \"same conditions\" aren't expected to have the same resulsts, especially mental illnesses.
