It's been a long time, and a lot of things have happened. I think it's finally gotten to the point where I can post an update that many of you asked for. I'll do shortest update to longest update.\n\nThe dress: many of you reached out and offered to try and help, and I'm so thankful to you. I couldn't respond to everyone, but thank you so much. As some of you suggested, Gpa used pieces of the original dress to make accessories for my sister to wear, and she loved them. She'll still wear some of the hair ties for special occasions. My aunt was able to make an almost perfect replica of the dress for the wedding, so while it wasn't the same, it was close.\n\nMy sister: she did have to go to the hospital to treat her crohns flare up. It was terrifying, and since she was immuno-compromised she did catch C19. I was so scared I was going to lose my baby sister, but thankfully she pulled through. She is now finally married to her wonderful wife. My ex and I tried to have C pay for the hospital bills, but my sister refused to take the money. They do have good insurance, luckily. SIL was still pissed and torn about having C at the wedding, but my sister insisted. C wasn't part of the wedding party, but she was still invited and joined their special day. While it's not forgotten or really forgiven, my sister is willing to move on, at least.\n\nFinally, C. I think seeing her aunt so sick did help kickstart C realizing how wrong she'd been, since it was a domino effect of her actions in the first place that started all of this. She herself admitted in therapy it was her jealousy over having to buy a wedding dress in the future instead of having one made for her like it was done for my sister. She does still struggle with her anger at times, but it is getting better. It turns out she used to get all her anger and aggression in sports at school with her friends, which is why she seemed so calm all other times, but being in lockdown just forced everything to build up in an unhealthy way. Still not an excuse for what happened, but at least an explanation.\n\nAs I said in an update last time, my ex and I are paying for college for whatever scholarships C doesn't get, so at the time taking the 12k for the dress seemed right. I do still stand by that. But after seeing how much she's worked on herself and on trying to repair things with my sister, I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills. She's also been working with my aunt and Gpa one day a week as well as editing other's essays to build back up her fun money. I matched 50%, and gave it to her when she graduated. She started college in the fall with a few scholarships, and is continuing therapy. Things are still tedious with her and my sister, but they're working on it. C has been trying hard, shown she really is sorry, and is trying to fix things. I still think we have a while to go, but we'll get there.", "created_utc": 1667961059, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq64ky/update_aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she/", "score": 2474, "replies": ["I didn\u2019t see your original post until just now.

But other than that the initial punishments were spot on in addition I have to ask have you possibly consider getting her into family therapy in the near future because I'm questioning how long has she had those issues and was she in therapy in the past before all this because she definitely has insecure the issues the grandmother was probably seen as a stability in her life and from everything and how you describe the punishments in the behaviors from childhood she probably still has some unresolved issues not dealing with the dress per se and your sister but mainly with you and your ex.

Just from what was described, I was in a very similar situation to C. I was a mentally ill teen during the pandemic with no friends and struggling (with the support of my family) against a healthcare system that didn't care about its patients. Remembering how I lashed out still makes me cringe. So I'm very glad that OP has the resources to put her in therapy.  \n\n However, the comments here seem to be glossing over the full weight of what C did. It wasn't just the destruction of a wedding dress (which still would have been a cruel thing to do), it was the destruction of a mother's last goodbye to her daughter. That was a priceless piece of history that SHOULD have been passed on for generations. To rip that away from the sister, leading her to have a severe health scare no less, is just as you said, Evil. I can't even comprehend it. While I relate to C somewhat, I also come from a family where we keep and cherish the clothes from family members who have passed on. They are part of our remembrance of them and our identity. I simply can't excuse such a cruel and vindictive act, even if it wasn't planned. Being a teen doesn't excuse what she did, just as it didn't excuse some of my actions as well. \n\nWhile I don't think C should be punished excessively nor is this an act that she can't come back from, by just giving her the spending money (which the average teenager doesn't get btw) and letting her attend the wedding, I feel like she faced no real consequences. I also feel insulted by Op's insistence on repeating her circumstances (which are valid) as if they explain away everything.

In the original post she wasn't even remorseful, just upset to lose her money. Nowhere in this post is a sincere apology mentioned!\n\nIt seems she was able to get away with blaming it on the pandemic and her dad rolled with it because he's still in the denial stage or something. Not only these, she didn't just destroy a priceless object, she also made OP's sister go through a serious medical situation.

He's not in the wrong for how he handles that he's not in the wrong for the initial punishments but when his wife and on the rest of the punishments with the exception of the dog it made me question are they really doing this to punish the daughter for the dress or they doing this because they want her to feel the pain that she did to the sister. Because this may go into complete isolation and mental emotional abuse territory. The punishment isn't a problem here it's the extended stuff from the isolation of friends to the complete feeling trapped because she's not sorry in the mental sense but she's definitely feeling like an outcast in her mind to say the least. You're not in the wrong here but your daughter needs some major intense therapy and not just for her one-on-one but you your ex and your sister need to be in Family Therapy with her because this will understand why she feels that way. I'm glad that she's finally getting it at least for individual therapy but I do believe that she needs to have more therapy particularly one-on-one therapy with you one-on-one with her mother one-on-one with your sister-in-law and definitely one-on-one with your sister and then the five of you need to do one big family therapy session and you and your daughter and her mother need to do one together because this anger has been building up for years and I honestly have to wonder what's making her this angry because if sports was her way of getting out that frustration why hasn't anyone sat down with her and talk to her about this. not to mention the great-grandmother was probably the only adult in her life that gave her a sense of stability and destroying the dress out of jealousy. Not to mention deep seated insecurities and emotional distress probably just made her snap and that was years of built up frustration.", "Sure - but you also didn\u2019t have a pandemic that completely upended your routine in your teen years, eliminated socialization, zoom school, and none of those teen milestones like prom/homecoming/etc.  The pandemic was rough on the most well adjusted kids. \n\nC used to have sports as an outlet and it disappeared in the pandemic.", "I have never again in my life felt the unbridled, aimless rage that I felt as a teenager.", "Completely agree with you it doesn't justify what she did but I want to know how long can these issues have been going on because they've been going on way before covid and I just think that the parents just ignore that until it got to the point where she destroyed the dress. I said earlier that the destruction of the dress what's the combination for all these issues. And my question is has anyone really sat down with her and ask why she so angry all the time because it seems to me like you have two people in there early 30s who probably see her as the biggest disappointment not to mention are probably waiting until she graduates before they can start over from scratch. I'm glad she's getting therapy but there's a lot more to the surface at the original poster needs to figure out because I'm starting to believe that she may have been through some form of emotional torment before she hit her teens and it's probably eat her up inside", "I\u2019d rather chew glitter than be a teen today.

Did anyone teach you how to repent and seek forgiveness as a child?", "Kid is a psycho", "I tell you what, let\u2019s be less OTT - you should have taken away the things your daughter had of your grandma\u2019s, and given them to your sister and SIL. To be given back at *their* discretion.\n\nI did say that you and your sister are better people than me. But you know, if you run over someone\u2019s dog by accident, the dog is still dead. C being mentally ill or the pandemic don\u2019t bring back your sister\u2019s wedding dress, don\u2019t undo the damage to her health that your child did. She nearly killed her and you\u2019re praising her for being sorry. \n\nI actually commented because I have sympathy for your daughter. Yes, what I said is cruel and vindictive. But *she* was cruel and vindictive. I can understand that, as I want people punished if they\u2019ve wronged someone. And yet I never act on it so it annoys me that she\u2019s essentially got away with it. To be honest, in a sense I\u2019m jealous: I\u2019ve never been showered with privileges for behaving like an evil monster, so I don\u2019t do it. \n\nDid you think nearly killing someone was punishment enough or something? No. If your sister had died, the blood would be on your daughter\u2019s hands. So you *matched her fun money*? Your SIL had to have *the person who nearly killed the love of her life* at her wedding?\n\nI don\u2019t relate to your forgiving her, I can\u2019t conceive of that at all. Several years ago my dog was killed due to a mistake during a routine visit to the vet. I have wished suffering on everyone involved ever since. Unfortunately the dog was in my mother\u2019s name because I\u2019d had her since I was a child, otherwise I\u2019d have sued them to ruin and not stopped until they were quivering shells of human beings.\n\nSure, a dress isn\u2019t a dog. But the death of my dog *was* a mistake. C caused huge damage to someone\u2019s health, through actions she admitted were *deliberate*. She will never have to suffer what she inflicted on someone else. I regard that as injustice and it makes me hate living in this world. \n\nI don\u2019t think C has faced anywhere near the appropriate consequences. You haven\u2019t explained why she was so burning with hatred and why you and your ex didn\u2019t notice it. Was she in love with SIL or something? Absolutely unhinged behaviour to get upset she can\u2019t have a wedding dress from grandma, aged 16.\n\n16 is old enough to understand what she was doing. Because she was \u2018sorry\u2019, you\u2019ve shielded her from the consequences of her actions. She hasn\u2019t lost out at all. She got her way. She got to ruin the dress. She keeps her gifts from grandma and your sister has nothing. That isn\u2019t right.\n\nI genuinely admire that you, and your sister especially, have it in you to offer C grace, because I wouldn\u2019t have. I wish I could say sincerely that I hope your daughter recovers well and does well in life. But I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t possess that magnanimity and I don\u2019t know where it comes from. So let\u2019s just say that I hope your daughter finds the inner peace one day to extend magnanimity to someone who nearly kills her with their selfishness. That\u2019s the best I can wish on her.", "Oh honey I\u2019ve had things from my childhood held over me my entire life that I didn\u2019t even do wrong.", "Oh okay.

I think with the initial punishments he was 100% in the right it was those other punishments and with the door removal at the idea of x where I thought he was going to far with it. And just from reading it I do feel like this is a guy that he knows his daughter has been struggling for years but just never wanted to do anything about it I mean think about it he and his ex had their daughter when they were 15 and 16 now look at this situation now 31 and 33 with the 18 year old. Why am I getting major vibes that the moment she graduates from college is the moment where the ex and the original poster are going to get back together and get married and have at least one more child just to write off their failures as parents. I think that he's still going to try to make the sister take the 3,000 at some point even though he's already given it back to his daughter and I also feel like she wanted his daughter at her wedding because she understood that it was a difficult time for all of us but she still butt hurt about it.

In this case, the person had the resources to get through it, and could afford to forgo the 3K.

Btw I had to go into a program for kids who could not go to regular school because I was so depressed after a traumatising incident my freshman year. I did not ever go to a school dance nor did any normal \u201chigh school\u201d stuff. I was home all day taking care of my grandma who was hit by a drunk driver (I had witnessed which is why I started failing in school) I dealt with the lack of socialization before the pandemic. \n\nI used to have speech and debate as an outlet, and was president of a poetry club. I took honors classes. My outlet was doing well in school and when that was \ntaken away I had nothing. So trust me I would know. As someone who has dealt with and currently deals with mental illness and trauma and is still in an unhealthy environment I am saying I KNOW what it is like to have that anger but I can\u2019t understand the actions. Trying to find ways to excuse the behavior or feel bad for an entitled girl isn\u2019t good. Sounds like she has caring and loving parents that want to help her.

I wanna start attending DBT for my BPD but don't know where to start", "I am so sorry this is happening. Healthcare systems in many countries need to do better. This should not be happening, ever. There are many online resources, especially a list of different skills people have figured out works commonly with BPD - I know it's not the same as actually having DBT, but maybe you can test some out and see what works when you start hitting your threshold! I have been finding myself in a similar position and for me working out works, for some yoga or using a massage balls in their hands help to regulate. Working our you can so at home, too! There are many ways without having to go to the gym, so maybe this could help - but skills are usually always very unique. Test and see what works for you!\n\nMy favourite skill always has been  invisible chair.

Maybe Black Desert Online could be something for you? It's free in some parts of the world, but not all.\n\n!", "CBT uses methods that are known to be really bad for most people with BPD. Mostly because people who have BPD don't have the emotional skills to deal with their traumas yet.  I want to clarify I don't think CBT is bad, but if emotional regulation isn't a skill, it can go south. CBT therapists usually aren't equipped to deal with BPD patients need for skillsetd, etc. DBT therapists are. I know CBT has worked for some with BPD, but there is a reason for DBT and when I used to be all full 9 criterias actively, CBT did more harm than good and I found out that it's not uncommon.  I just want to make it clear I am not demonising CBT, it helps so many people and now me too.  It just fucked me up when I started it too early and that was a shotshow.\n\nDBT is \"Dialectical behavior therapy\" and focuses a lot on the black and white thinking we have as BPD. A coin for us only has two sides, but no in-between. With DBT, for me at least, there was a lot of focus what I thought were expectations from others, but were actually from me that I was just projecting on me. Also, that one situation is not the ultimate \"it's always the same\", very big for abandonment issues. BPD often leads people to fulfilling their expectations by starting to display unpleasent behavior towards e.g. a person they like and they are so convinced they'll leave you. When they do, it's a self prophecy. DBT helps with realising why this happens, what the root cause is and how you can soer through 10 million racing thoughts at once.\n\nThe biggest difference to CBT is the emotional regulation. Very often people underestimate how strongly many with BPD can feel emotions. Up to 7 to 9 times more than the average person! That's a lot to process for the brain, ESPECIALLY as quite a few cases with BPD actually have two brain areas that are too small. The amygdala and hippocampus, which are important for emotional regulation. There are several mixed studies, but the general accepted consensus is that BPD without those areas being smaller isn't uncommon.\n\nI highly recommend to go for DBT, CBT focuses on very different areas that usually relate more to figuring out how to deal with traumas and etc. and untreated BPD patients aren't often capable of handling this too early. This can quickly cause a down spiral if BPD isn't regulated. DBT helps to figure out first how to deal with those racing car emotions in a manageable way. \n\nWith my therapist, we have slowly switched more to CBT, because I figured out skills to regulate myself much better, but it took a few years before we did that. DBT does touch on traumas, ptsd, phobia etc. to some degree, but not too intense.  \n\nWith CBT  herapists you also face the issue of a huge stigma... Those who focus in DBT are usually more willing to accept people with BPD, but many who don't focus in Borderline therapy, have a huge stigma against BPD. In the day clinic I went to, some had to go there, because therapists rejected them. called them lost cases not worthy of being treated. From different towns and I researched it, it's a big issue that we can face. Going for someone who offers DBT often mitigates this problem, but not always. Even there can be therapists who have prejudice towards people with BPD.\n\nDBT mostly focuses on those aspects:\nMindfulness\u00a0\u2013 To stay focused in the present.\n\nDistress tolerance \u2013  You'll get to know new skills to deal with current situations and learn how to deal with uncomfortable situations.\n\nEmotional regulation \u00a0\u2013 You learn how to cognjae and cope with negative emotions. \n\nInterpersonal effectiveness \u2013 It focuses on learning how to express and assert your needs without aggression/problematic behaviorm\n\nEDIT: Also about the thread, ngl I was scared about the response it might get due to the stigma around BPD, but I am happy it hasn't caused any negativity!\n\nEdit\u00b2: spelling errors\n\nEdit\u00b3: I want to clarify, if a therapist rejects BPD patients on the basis that they don't think they can help them or they can't handle them, that's fine, but it's not uncommon that rejections are often harsh and they tell you you're a lost cause due to BPD. If a therapists or psychologist does not feel equipped to deal with people who have BPD, that's fine, but it's about how some people get rejected with awful commentary.", "yeah, being told by a CBT therapist they don't take patients with BPD when i was having a turbulent time just made the self-loathing intense\n\ni have a great psychiatrist though and he also acts as my therapist, but i think having a more specific focused therapy type might be what i need. because my psychiatrist was sooo helpful when i just was in constant crisis and helped me get to functional. but i think i wanna thrive now", "Oh yea, I get that.
