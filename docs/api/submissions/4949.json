Most processed foods, especially in the US, have corn syrup or corn starch in them. There are also lots of things that don\u2019t have the word corn in them, but are still corn (modified food starch is corn starch most of the time). I have a corn allergy and my family definitely did not follow my diet. I had to make a lot of big changes when I found out. Putting a dairy and a nut allergy on top of that?? That\u2019s really tough. I think it\u2019s fair to assume that OP knows what\u2019s going on with his kids allergies and isn\u2019t randomly forgetting a special list of foods that would be perfect for all three of them.", "Depending on the level of the allergy, corn could mean nothing Store bought, including sauces and marinades. Maybe it\u2019s better now. That was what I remember from a kid in my childhood."]}
