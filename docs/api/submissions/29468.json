{"id": 29468, "submission_id": "17e6f72", "title": "AITA for going off on the head teacher and the receptionist after my son was denied lunch", "selftext": "Last Wednesday a I, 39f was sitting with my son 14m when he told me he was feeling dizzy and was going to get a drink. He stood up and immediately fainted. I immediately rushed to his side to help him and he regained consciousness a couple minutes later. \n\nAfterwards, I asked him if he knew what could have caused his episode. He told me that since he didn't have any money on his lunch card he was denied any food including the two days previous.I was confused as my son receives free lunches from the school as we aren't very well off, he told me they had gotten a new lunch lady who didn't know he was on free lunches and denied him food until I put money on his lunch card. \n\nI was absolutely livid and decided to see the head teacher the next day. I was appalled of his lack of organization, he should have made the new dinner lady aware of who was on free lunches, I was also shocked that if a student wasn't on free lunches and didn't have lunch money they would just be denied lunch. \n\n I went down to the school the next day and immediately started yelling at the head teacher, even threatening to report the school to Ofsted. I didn't let him get a word in, I told him that he was irresponsible and unprofessional for allowing a child's to be neglected to be neglected and I could report this to the police for criminal negligence. (I honestly don't know if could, I was just angry and wanted to scare him) He told me he would fire the dinner lady, this only made me more mad as it wasn't really her fault, she was just complying with the policy. When I was done I just told him to do better or next time I will report him and left his office. \n\nThis seems like it would be the end of it but no. At this point it seems important to note that I am black, I adopted my son when he was 11 and he is white. As I was leaving the receptionist asked why I was yelling at the head teacher. I thought she was being a bit nosy but I decided to tell her anyway, I gave her a brief rundown of what happened, she then scoffed and said \"I don't know why it matters so much, he's not even your kid, anyone can see that, you've only known him 3 years.\" \n \nI was shocked and told her that she was a racist piece of sh*t and she can go f herself and her job after what she said\n\nI thought it was justified then but now I'm starting to second guess myself. Don't get me wrong I couldn't care less about the receptionist and I WILL be reporting her. I'm more concerned about how I may have acted out of anger and directed it at the wrong person. I don't know how I reacted to the situation will effect my chances of it actually being addressed, I feel like what I said to the receptionist may also effect my chances. My husband thinks my anger was misdirected and I should've been more calm as it's probably some government rule or something with the school governors. I feel really bad now. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698017237, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17e6f72/aita_for_going_off_on_the_head_teacher_and_the/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Certainly, *we can't have that*. \n\nA ball got dropped at school as new staff rolled in, it happens, it's a void in experience and knowlege, it was corrigible and yes this child is old enough to be expected to raise the issue of getting starved with their parent. The school is not at fault for his or her mental issues; they *can* be reasonably expected to mention they're experiencing an issue in a time frame and manner where it can be corrected and everyone can calmly get on with their things.\n\nHer household sounds like a hot mess, and yes the fact her son doesn't feel he can come to her with this cause he fears he's a financial inconvenience IS a problem and not one that the school can be blamed on in any way.", "The part where they blame the *adopted son with a troubled history* for being ashamed of being denied and worried about causing problems. Yes it is something OP needs to work on with him, but the kid was adopted at 11 and has only had three years with a presumably more healthy environment compared to as many as 11 years of an unhealthy one beforehand.\n\nMy mother used to do respite care for foster workers so I met a few kids who were in the system and even the ones who had been in a stable home for several years still had a few issues, because a bad childhood can have a significant lasting effect.\n\nNo outrage is needed, but compassion for the kid *is*."]}
