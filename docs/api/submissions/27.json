I have a 14 year old sister who wanted a way to make easy cash so I asked her if she could come over before to let the dogs out to use bathroom(my apartment is across the street from the school) and after school and feed the dogs and let them out and sit with them for a little while or for however long she wanted to get away from home for a little bit. She agreed and so did my parents. \n\nI have the ring door bell app and it was the 3rd day she was house sitting and I never check but I just was bored and saw her and a 3 other girls walk in. I never told her people could come over so I text her and she says it\u2019s friends from school. I told her they needed to leave. She stopped answering my text and about 2 hours later I got the notification they were leaving. I was upset, but thought as long as nothing was stolen then I guess it\u2019s okay.\n\nWhen I got home, my bedroom was a mess. Clothes were everywhere im assuming my sister was trying them on. One of my Michael Kors bags were gone. I was also given a bottle of P\u00e9trus (wine) for my 21st birthday that I hadn\u2019t opened yet. I found it half full in the back of my cabinet, wide open. I was obviously really mad. I texted my sister and told her that she was no longer getting paid, and my bag that was missing better be returned or I\u2019d be talking to parents. I texted my mom and snitched for my sister drinking because I was mad and a 14 year old shouldn\u2019t be drinking.\n\nMy sister texted me back calling me a b*tch and that I needed to pay her or else I lied because she fed the dogs everyday. I told her you don\u2019t get paid when you trash a house and steal. My sisters really mad, she\u2019s grounded and my moms trying to find out the girls parents names.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH because yeah, she fed the dogs, but things are missing now and my house is a mess.

NTA.", "NTA - She stole and she abused the situation she was given. Trashing the house WTF.", "NTA. How do her parents feel about her drinking on the job?", "NTA. She stole from you.", "NTA - She trashed the house, stole, and got drunk on the job. Unacceptable behavior and she does not deserve to get paid after choosing to act so irresponsibly. I\u2019m sure that bag cost more than whatever you were going to pay her anyway, and if she can\u2019t get it back to you then she\u2019ll at least need to pay you back the dollar amount.", "Holy crap. They destroyed your bedroom, stole from you, and drank *your own* alcohol in your apartment while you were away?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t pay her period. Change your locks if you have to and ban her from your house.\n\nNTA.", "NTA your implied contract was that the house would be in the same condition as when you left. She violated that contract, pretty severely. There has to be a penalty for her.\n\n- Don't pay her\n\n- Invoice her ( cc Parents) for your time and costs\n\n(Also, a Kors bag? Isn't that pretty pricey? And she just stole it?)", "Nta. I think from the bag alone (if not returned) would basically eat up what was damaged and stolen. She shouldn't of had friends over. She is facing the consequences of her and her friends actions.", "NTA. This is how your sister learns a lesson about treating other people's homes and items with respect.", "NTA. How on earth can she expect to be paid after ignoring your direct requests.", "NTA. You are essentially using what you were going to pay her to pay for the damages she and her friends caused. Let us hope that your sister learns her lesson now when it's just her little butt being hurt because her parents know she's drinking and either stealing or hanging out with kids who steal, rather than in a few (a VERY FEW) years when stealing and trashing shit could get her a record.", "NTA she fucked around and found out", "NTA. Your sister is though. She has a lot of growing up to do. She owes you a massive apology", "NTA, the other option is to call the police, the kids' parents etc.  You chose the most mild option IMO.  \n\nAfter your hourly rate cleaning up after her, your missing items, I would think that leaves her with zero dollars.  That said I'd insist on the stolen items back or she can face the consequences", "NTA... Verbal agreement constitutes a contract.  Pay her and give her a bill for damages and losses.  That's the typical legal advice.  If she wants to give up her friends for a reduced bill that can be offered but in the end it's her responsibility.\n\nOn the side did you keep the video of them entering?\nWith a yearbook you should be able to figure out who they are.", "NTA...\n\nSo I'm guessing what she would have made feeding and sitting your dogs is less then it would cost to replace the bag, wine, and hire someone to clean the mess... Itemize it all and subtract what you would have paid her, give her a bill for the balance.", "NTA. You did not give her permission to let other people come over and go through your belongings. She let strangers into your home.", "Nta she\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call the cops", "NTA Next time she asks to be paid, create an invoice. List the agreed upon amount of house sitting, then deduct the cost of cleaning, the bag and the $$ wine and present her her bill.", "Nta. She's got until the end of the day or you turn that video over to the cops. They will get her to squeal real quick", "NTA. Tell her you\u2019ve docked her pay from the cost of the bag, the wine and a cleaning fee.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nThat isn\u2019t how things work. Why should you pay for a horrible job done? Not to mention drinking on the job at her age?! Yeah, no NTA. Let's also not forget the fact she stole from you", "NTA, and she did get paid - with a VERY expensive bottle of wine she ruined, and a Michael Kors bag. She deserves nothing else, and she should be ashamed of herself. She should apologize to you.", "NTA and I'm loving your parents.  My only question is why the didn't get rid of the open bottle of wine? I'm assuming they don't realize wine doesn't keep like spirits.", "I find it very hard to believe that your sister was an angel and then suddenly snapped. Has there not been any red flags over the years? Assuming this is real, obviously NTA. She violated your trust and took advantage of the situation.\n\nYou should send her a bill for the wine and the cost of cleaning the house.", "NTA. \"Pay\" her but deduct cleaning, washing, the wine and the handbag.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

LOL\n\nYet she trashed your room, drank your wine (which can't people get in trouble for underage drinking?) and also stole from you. Your sister doesn't see anything wrong with that. She could have gotten you in trouble. I'm guessing. Someone please help me with that. \n\nDoesn't matter that she fed the dogs. She shown your house no respect.

Only after the bag is returned though. That's a lesson to her about consequences, but also being fairly rewarded for working", "You know, if you bring a screen shot of their faces or the video and show school officials, they can be quite helpful.", "You\u2019re wrong. A 14 year old is capable of babysitting and pet sitting at a relative\u2019s house 2 blocks away.

The average price of a bottle of Chateau Petrus is more than $4,000.00.\n\nThis is grand theft.

You only decided to deduct money for space rent, housekeeping needed after them, wine and bag. \n\nNTA.", "I mean, I'm no wine expert, but isn't Petrus like Uber expensive?  I doubt three days of house sitting even comes close.", "Maybe that's the answer here so little sis better understands and learns something in a slightly more positive way. \n\nOP could write up an invoice for the services, then detail the expenses that were deducted and the shortfall that big sis is kindly letting go", "That comment was directed at someone above who  ridiculously said \"YTA you left a child in charge.\"\n\nNTA, btw.", "Yes, I was replying to a ridiculous comment. You are definitely NTA.", "I'm thinking they mean it's like a life lesson about consequences. The reality of getting reimbursed is it will take a long time at best, but it would show little sis that you can't get away with doing things like this without consequences. \n\nIf I had someone do a job for me and they damaged or stole my property. I would respond to their request for payment by detailing out the costs to remedy. Then either pay the difference or ask them to pay me the difference.

Little sister (or her parents, who are legally responsible for her actions) should be paying to replace them.", "Good idea!", "Or show the school\u2019s administration and ask them?", "2018 is currently being marketed for more than $4K.", "Plenty of bags cost a \\*lot\\* more than the wine.", "Exactly. No idea what the parents got OP, but a bottle can easily cost hundreds to thousands of dollars.", "Lol I bet little 14 year old sis had no idea that she drunk a few hundred dollars", "School admins won't divulge student information for legal & privacy reasons.", "Not Michael kors, but petrus is also hard to come by plus the price tag.  It\u2019s actually harder to replace, it\u2019s not like it was a berkin bag.  Now that\u2019s a travesty.", "Since 3 of them only managed half, I bet she didn\u2019t even like it", "They aren't supposed to, but they totally will.", "I mean it entirely depends on the specific wine and the specific bag. There are Petrus bottles that cost a few hundred and Michael Kors bags that cost a few thousand (which I would personally never pay for such a tacky brand that steals designs, but that doesn't mean OP didn't)", "Lol usually the way at that age", "At the least, you can show them the evidence and tell them to please inform the parents and to pass on your number as not only were they underage drinking they stole from your house and trashed it.", "If it\u2019s reported to the police, the info will be given to the police, the purse is likely valuable enough to make it something criminal so they will pursue especially since it would be easy to solve (give them the video, tell the cops where they go to school)"]}
