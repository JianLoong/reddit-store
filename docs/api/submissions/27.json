You just discovered that your bf is ok with people cheating in their relationships.", "NTA\u2026 but your boyfriend certainly. It also makes me wonder if his friends would cover for him if he was cheating on you. Any guy that would cover for a friend that was cheating is not a guy that you want to be in a relationship with. Hes already showed you hes morally bankrupt.   Do yourself a favor and dump him before he cheats on you.", "NTA - but question is 'how often did Eric say BF was with him?'\n\nIf BF is comfortable assisting his buddy, then what are the chances he'll play away, given the opportunity", "Oooo girl, thats a big ol\u2019 bowl of spaghetti sauce. Dont walk, RUN. If he\u2019s mat at you for NOT covering for a cheater???????? He probably is also a cheater. You scratch my back i scratch yours. He does this so he knows they\u2019ll do the same for him.", "Nta, but your bf is an absolute idiot for doing smth like that in front of u", "NTA. \n\nHere\u2019s a little psychology for you that pertains to the \u201cnone of your business comment.\u201d  \n\nA micro environment is an environment that has a direct effect on you. Being at the restaurant with your boyfriend is an example of a micro environment. It had a direct effect on you so it is 100% your business. \n\nMacro environment is an environment that has an indirect effect on you. Your boyfriends best friend is now going to be in a bad mood because he was outed as a cheater. This will most definitely spill out onto your boyfriend and then on to you. That has an indirect effect on you. \n If something has an effect on you then you have a right to say something about it.\n\nMy question is if your boyfriend is ok covered for his best friend so his best friend can cheat then my concern would be what\u2019s stopping your boyfriend from doing the same thing to you?", "NTA, but as others have said he seemed way to in his element. If he lies and covers for a cheater that easily then they probably do it for each other. Not to mention him telling you to shut up. You really shouldn\u2019t allow your bf to talk to you like that. I\u2019d really really really be concerned about him being honest and faithful. Well because he\u2019s not honest at all. Honest people don\u2019t lie so easily and about something so serious. Be careful with this one or you will end up with your heart broken when his friends are lying for him.", "NTA. If he was willing to cover for his cheating friend, his friend will probably do the same thing when, not if, when he cheats on you.

Eric definitely covers for him too.", "NTA but know this is a preview of what he's going to do to you.  He thinks cheating and lying to cover cheating is a good thing.", "NTA, but he is.

He clearly doesn't see any problem with infidelity.", "NTA, sounds like him and Eric are a lot alike.", "NTA. Good for you for calling out his lies! He was helping his friend to cheat. That is a huge red flag. Sounds like Eric isn\u2019t the only one who should get dumped.", "NTA but why are you dating a liar?", "NTA, not even one shred. But you do realize your bf has just shown you his true colors, right?", "NTA\nAnd that's a huge red flag.\nDo not trust this guy.

Eric's GF should schedule a trip to her general practitioner for an STD check.  Once a cheater, always a cheater.\n\nThe next worse thing to a cheater is the \"friend\" that covers for him.

I could never trust a person who could do something like this again.", "NTA but you should be thinking carefully about being with a guy whose covering for someone else's cheating.", "NTA, and honestly I think if your boyfriend does this for a friend, he'll have a friend do it for him as well.", "NTA. And leave! His mates will protect him like he protects them.", "NTA and you have zero reason to trust your boyfriend in anything moving forward. He covers for his friend when he lies, assume his friend does the same for him.

You might want to consider that.", "OP, end the relationship NOW. Your BF is covering for his cheating friend and his cheating friend will do it for him. If he's willing to lie over this, he'll lie to you.", "N. T. A. \n\nApparently he thinks its ok, Time to dump him", "NTA.  And watch your back.

I left before he got physical, but he was working his way up to it. He had to be hospitalized when I told him I wanted a divorce, then threw me out of the house, took \"his\" vehicle back (he'd gotten me to sell mine), and denied me access to my things.
