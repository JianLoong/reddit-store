My brother is married and has a 2-year-old daughter. My parents and sister live in the same city as my brother, I live in a different city a few hours away. In the last few months my sister has been complaining that  my brother invites her to his family outings only to use her as a babysitter for our niece. He'd ask her to restaurants or parks and make her watch the child while he and SIL  enjoyed themselves. She decided to stop going out with them, and our parents supported her, even talking to my brother about it.\n\nDespite their talk, my brother didn't take it seriously. He wanted my sister to join a road trip (it was like a 3 days 2 nights kind of thing, leaving on a sunday coming back on tuesday), my sister didn\u2019t want to go and my parents said no anyway because she would miss 2 school days (keep in mind in our side of the world it\u2019s not summer and kids are in school here). \n\nLast Sunday, when our parents were at church, my brother showed up  at our house and told my sister to get in the car because they were going on the road trip. She said she didn\u2019t want to go, but he insisted and they both (SIl ad Brother) made her get in the car.\n\nWhen she was in the car my sister texted me and told me  the whole thing, she said she had texted my parents too but she didn\u2019t think they were reading her messages soon because they were in the sunday service. So I called my brother. I reminded him  that our parents had said no and my sister didn't want to go anyway so he better turned that car and drop my sister back home.  He dismissed me, claiming I was not the boss of him.\n\nI asked him if he knew that what he did is kidnapping and  I warned that I would totally call the police if he didn\u2019t return my sister home right away.  He laughed it off and hung up. So, I called the police. The police found them quickly since they haven\u2019t even left the city yet. Our parents didn't press charges and the whole thing was dropped quite easily and quickly. My parents are furious at my brother of course, but they divided about what I did. My mom is angry  at me for involving  the police. She agrees my brother was wrong and that I had limited options since I'm in a different city but she thinks I went too far. Especially because my 2 years old niece was in the car too and it must have been a scary situation for her. She believes that if I had waited for them (my parents) to get out of sunday service she could have talk to my brother and convince him to drop my sister back home. She said in the half an hour it would\u2019ve taken them to be out of sunday service, my brother wouldn\u2019t have even left the city yet since traffic was horrible. My father thinks it was great since I probably scared my brother into never taking my sister without permission again and said this should teach my brother a lesson. So reddit.
