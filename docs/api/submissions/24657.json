She decided to stop going out with them, and our parents supported her, even talking to my brother about it.\n\nDespite their talk, my brother didn't take it seriously. He wanted my sister to join a road trip (it was like a 3 days 2 nights kind of thing, leaving on a sunday coming back on tuesday), my sister didn\u2019t want to go and my parents said no anyway because she would miss 2 school days (keep in mind in our side of the world it\u2019s not summer and kids are in school here). \n\nLast Sunday, when our parents were at church, my brother showed up  at our house and told my sister to get in the car because they were going on the road trip. She said she didn\u2019t want to go, but he insisted and they both (SIl ad Brother) made her get in the car.\n\nWhen she was in the car my sister texted me and told me  the whole thing, she said she had texted my parents too but she didn\u2019t think they were reading her messages soon because they were in the sunday service. So I called my brother. I reminded him  that our parents had said no and my sister didn't want to go anyway so he better turned that car and drop my sister back home.  He dismissed me, claiming I was not the boss of him.\n\nI asked him if he knew that what he did is kidnapping and  I warned that I would totally call the police if he didn\u2019t return my sister home right away.  He laughed it off and hung up. So, I called the police. The police found them quickly since they haven\u2019t even left the city yet. Our parents didn't press charges and the whole thing was dropped quite easily and quickly. My parents are furious at my brother of course, but they divided about what I did. My mom is angry  at me for involving  the police. She agrees my brother was wrong and that I had limited options since I'm in a different city but she thinks I went too far. Especially because my 2 years old niece was in the car too and it must have been a scary situation for her. She believes that if I had waited for them (my parents) to get out of sunday service she could have talk to my brother and convince him to drop my sister back home. She said in the half an hour it would\u2019ve taken them to be out of sunday service, my brother wouldn\u2019t have even left the city yet since traffic was horrible.

A case could be made to call this trafficking if they are in the states but you are 100% right that it would never stick. Without proof that he intended to use the child for unpaid labor, especially with the familial relationship, the worst he could get is kidnapping.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your sister and to your brother. Your mother is being ridiculous right now, and your brother knows she'llnever stand up to him. He literally forced a young girl into his car and was going to keep her for 3 days, against her will. If that doesn't justify calling the police, I don't know what does. He and his wife are not quality people. And if their child got scared, they had Daddy to thank for that.", "NTA", "NTA", "1000% NTA", "You\u2019re all ass holes", "NTA your entitled brown starfish of a brother got exactly half of what he deserved (charges should have stuck). Your mom however can't seem to see all the major red flags through the rose tinted glasses she uses to look at your brother", "You did the right thing OP.\n\nIf he pulls a stunt like that again, phone the police right away.  Don't even threaten to do it, just do it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Your mum is burying her head in the sand. Your dad is spot on. Why isn't anyone talking about how scary that would have been for your sister?? The poor thing! You did the right thing and I applaud you for looking out for your sister.", "NTA. Your brother and his wife are certifiable.", "Oh totally NTA!!\n\nHe forceably kidnapped your 13 year old sister! He laughed at you when you told him what he did and to return her! You warned him what you were going to do and he hung up!\n\nHe FAFO!  You were right, your dad is right, your sister was smart to call you, your mother is delulu, your sil is a moron, your niece is innocent, your brother is an idiotic jackass.", "NTA\n\nI would be tempted to call your country's version of Child Protective Services to get their take on the situation.\n\nYour mother needs to wake up before your brother does something even dumber than kidnapping.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother and SIL are entitled ahole. \nWhat!!!!", "NTA: Did your mom really think he\u2019d just drive her back? I have a feeling your mom will still let your brother visit your sister even if she doesn\u2019t want to.", "NTA OH MY GOD she\u2019s 13!!!?? Like what?? No she is a minor you can\u2019t just steal your fuckin sister. Great job calling the police you did the right thing", "NTA\n\nThe majority of kidnappings happen when a family member takes a child they are not meant to have. Usually parents who don't currently have custody, but it extends to other family as well.\n\nYou and your dad need to break this down for mom: your brother was told no for multiple reasons, including your sister's education. He then came to their hone when he knew they would not be there. He and his wife then harassed your sister into the car. What did they say/do to achieve this? Has your sister said? Did he use force? Threats? It certainly wasn't a kind request.\n\nYour mom's focus needs to be on protecting her daughter. If that means the cops are involved, so be it. But it also means that they need to take steps now to ensure she feels safe in her home.", "Info: Did your brother carry on with their trip after this thing was resolved?", "NTA and why is smelling like your brother is the golden Kid ?", "OP is clearly not in the US, abandonment of child might not work the same way.", "OP said its winter where she lives so not America. If it's Australia where she lives, our emergency police, fire and ambulance is actually 000 NOT 911, New Zealand if i remember correctly is 111. please read and don't assume every post is America based\n\n(Re-read paragraph 2)", "They don't live in the US. Hopefully their country has an equivalent of 911.", "Honestly the fact that he kidnapped his 13 year old sister to babysit his kid and mom thought she could \u201ctalk him out of it?\u201d Yeah no. He took it way to far, and frankly I\u2019m saddened that she seems more concerned about the brother\u2019s feelings than the 13 year old daughter that was LITERALLY kidnapped! Personally, I think the 2 year old would have been just as scared seeing their aunt be forced into a car by their dad and seeing her visibly upset and scared, even though they wouldn\u2019t understand what happened. Idk what OP\u2019s mom is thinking, but good on OP for taking action. This kind of behavior can escalate and it\u2019s scary to think about what he would\u2019ve done if he got her out of state. \n\nSpeaking of which, where the hell was SIL? Did she just sit by and let him do this? Wth is wrong with these people?! Ugh.", "> Is your brother her golden child?\n\nHe IS the only boy.  OP and sister are female and the grandchild is female.   \n\nAlso, everyone is so quick to jump to golden child but sometimes a shitty person's behavior puts a loved one on the defense constantly.  To the point where the family member/spouse/whoever doesn't even register that the shitty person needs to have their ass whooped.   They don't realize it's a habit that needs to be broken.   \n\nSo it's possible brother has been a heathen his whole life and mom is so used to defending him and getting him out of trouble through his life that she doesn't even realize she's doing it.   \n\nDoes that excuse her?  Of course not.  But getting the situation corrected would require a different tactic than one with reddit's nemesis, the \"golden child\".    \n\nPS - OP is NTA.  She erred in favor of the minor in the situation that had no power.  Never gonna be an asshole for that", "Yes, the mother's priority here should be her own young child, not this AH adult kidnapper of a son. Does she not realise that he actually kidnapped this child to have a babysitter? .", "I bet the mom would be like \u201cBut family!\u201d", "Why does the mom think he would listen? He already knows she doesn\u2019t approve, and HE DOESN\u2019T CARE!  What could she have said that he doesn\u2019t already know? They must have planned for the parents to call at some point, and they clearly don\u2019t care what anyone thinks.", "NTA did mom tell brother it was ok to take sister bc that reaction is wild. Also how are brother and sister-in-law ok with 13 year old basically caring for kids on vacations that\u2019s not ok", "This part. This is the part that is the most telling and frankly the scariest part. What if OP had waited and they got past state lines? This just gives me the creeps", "End of third paragraph - SIL helped him force her into the car.  Sis is lucky they didn\u2019t take her phone away, but needs to be wary now because they may not make that mistake again.  Those two are a matched set.", "Ok, but what about the wife? Who the fuck raised her??? Like how in the hell is she not freaked out about her husband forcing a teen girl into a car??", "Funny how she isn't the least bit afraid for what might have happened to her own daughter. Guess only grand kids count in her opinion. And yours.", "If OP is in Australia our traffic (atleast in my experience) can be packed as hell for a good 10-15minutes of stand still then instantly clear up where your going \"what the hell caused all that\". So her argument that \"they wouldnt have been able to leave town within the 30minutes we had until we finished service\" it bat crap crazy. Also the getting past state lines would depend on where in the state they were.\n\nFamily or not, he kidnapped her child, and she apparently doesn't care since she is more concerned about a clueless 2yr olds emotions than her daughter, who was the actual kidnapping victim here.\n\nNTA, but your dad definitely has to have a serious talk to his wife.", "EW I completely missed that. Even worse. Ugh.\n\nIf OP\u2019s mom really cared for that grand baby, she would report those two to CPS, cause there\u2019s no way in hell they\u2019re taking care of him properly.", "No. When totally justified, it is not in grey area.\n\nHe kidnapped the sister. Being blood means shit.", "Because that's what I said.\n\nLot of all or nothing for you people, huh? I know nuance is too much to ask for the average redditor.", "Jesus, get over yourself. I never said that the daughter didn't matter. I said it could make sense that she doesn't want the police involved. Idk if you keep up to date with the news, but the police have a habit of killing people for no reason in a lot of countries. If she were in the US, and they were POC, I could see her not wanting the police involved for that exact reason. Im sure she's thinking she can get her kid back if she mom's the brother enough, and I'm not going to fault her for not wanting one of her children - no matter how fucked up what he did was - to die in a police encounter gone wrong.\n\nBut nope. I'm just a heartless monster. So's the mom. Nuance is dead, and you know everything.", "EXACTLY!! I live in the states, but in the Midwest and we have similar traffic. Clogged to hell, then almost completely clear later. The fact that her daughter was sitting in a car terrified and she basically said she should wait until she was finished with what she was doing is disgusting. Thank god OP and the dad have some sense.", "The fact that I literally work with human trafficking victims in the US, and international laws are some things we have to bounce around every now and then depending on clients.", "There could be possible \"conspiracy to human traffic\" but because he never got to the \"forcing the girl to work for him\" part, he'd never be charged with real human trafficking.\n\nBunch of fucking arm chair lawyers on this god damn website. Thank you for being sensible.", "Forced labor =/= human trafficking", "Ugh, trust me, I know that all too well on this sub."]}
