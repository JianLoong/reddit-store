She decided to stop going out with them, and our parents supported her, even talking to my brother about it.\n\nDespite their talk, my brother didn't take it seriously. He wanted my sister to join a road trip (it was like a 3 days 2 nights kind of thing, leaving on a sunday coming back on tuesday), my sister didn\u2019t want to go and my parents said no anyway because she would miss 2 school days (keep in mind in our side of the world it\u2019s not summer and kids are in school here). \n\nLast Sunday, when our parents were at church, my brother showed up  at our house and told my sister to get in the car because they were going on the road trip.

So I called my brother. I reminded him  that our parents had said no and my sister didn't want to go anyway so he better turned that car and drop my sister back home.  He dismissed me, claiming I was not the boss of him.\n\nI asked him if he knew that what he did is kidnapping and  I warned that I would totally call the police if he didn\u2019t return my sister home right away.  He laughed it off and hung up. So, I called the police. The police found them quickly since they haven\u2019t even left the city yet.

My mom is angry  at me for involving  the police. She agrees my brother was wrong and that I had limited options since I'm in a different city but she thinks I went too far. Especially because my 2 years old niece was in the car too and it must have been a scary situation for her. She believes that if I had waited for them (my parents) to get out of sunday service she could have talk to my brother and convince him to drop my sister back home. She said in the half an hour it would\u2019ve taken them to be out of sunday service, my brother wouldn\u2019t have even left the city yet since traffic was horrible.

He kidnapped your sister. He did a classic example of fuck around and find out. You also gave him fair warning.", "NTA. And your mom needs to bloody well open her eyes. Your brother is using your sister, going so far as to kidnap her. And she thinks calling the cops was bad? Hell I would\u2019ve pressed charges if my son pulled a stunt like that. No more unsupervised visit with the sister. And your dad needs to talk some sense into your mom. \n\nIs your brother her golden child?", "Nta\n\nHe took a minor against her will, without the permission of the minor's parents, that is kidnapping. \n\nYou called the police and reported a crime because *he* committed a crime.

WTF does he think he is, kidnapping your sister?!", "NTA.  \nI would have done the same thing.  \nNot going to listen to me, parents, or the younger sibling you're forcing to babysit? Cool, listen to the cops about it then.  \nTell your brother and his wife that if they're old enough to be married and have their own family, they're old enough to grow up.  \nThe amount of resounding no's are enough to make me want to yell at him.

More often than not people are victimized by people they know than random strangers. Your brother sounds immature and not ready to be a father. Maybe he should have thought about spending his 20's growing up instead of speed running marriage and parenthood.", "YTA unless there is open gang warfare in the streets or something of that magnitude in violence is it a rare event for the police to make a situation better.", "NTA.\n\nForcibly taking someone somewhere where they don't want to do is kidnapping, he fucked around and found out, good on you for looking after your sister (and glad your father is on both your sides).", "NTA. A worthwhile learning experience for your brother. Not everyone in his life is going to enable and excuse him like your mother.", "NTA. He literally kidnapped your sister.", "I\u2019m team Dad. You did the right thing and I am sure that your sister appreciated it.", "1000% NTA", "NTA,\n\nDrama aside, it's not a laughing matter to take a kid away forcefully for your own personal needs especially if you're not the primary guardian or caretaker.
