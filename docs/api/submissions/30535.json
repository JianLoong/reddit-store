You are a grown up and don't need your mommy tending to you. Your brother's advice of letting things from the past go is not correct. You don't get to abuse someone for years and then bring soup thinking all is forgiven.", "I guess it depends on how important your mother is to you.  Obviously you've not gotten any therapy to work through your past anger issue with your mother - which I highly suggest you do, I mean as a 34M I kinda think you should have already dealt with it, but here we are.....\n\nDoes screaming at your mom make you feel better or worse?  Are you sure mom wasn't struggling herself when you were a teenager? Maybe she was trying her best?  I mean what did dad do to help?  \n\nI personally think you treated your mom like an asshole.", "NTA,\n\nI am in the exact same boat, my mom was exclusively abusive towards me and perfectly fine towards my younger siblings. \n\nAfter kicking me out at 18 (on the day of my birthday) and realizing that I went in a once or twice a year contact situation with her,  she suddenly went out of her way to try to get back in my life pretending to be the perfect mom that did nothing wrong and who's 'hurt' that I have no love for her.\n\nThe happiest moments in my life are when I have the least amount of contact with her/guilt trip from siblings that are too gullible to realize that they've had a different treatment.", "Nta", "NTA - in the same boat. Physically and mentally abusive mother, left me a latch-key kid looking after my younger sibling when I was barely double-digits. She's changed over the years, but it comes with no recollection/acknowledgement of what she did when I was young. My sibling forgave her because life was hard back then, but I can't. It would be so much easier if I fell in line with everyone else, but I just don't know how to have parents present in my life. \n\nI don't know the answer either, but I just wanted to say you're not weird or wrong to still feel the way you do. It's a hard thing to forgive and try to forget. Those childhood years are so formative, and the way we learn to cope then sticks with us forever. It's ok to want to keep boundaries to protect yourself. But it's harder when your sibling is on team forgiveness and you're not. Two kids can live through the same thing and experience it very differently.\n\nAny trust or relationship will take a long time to build - if it's even possible to get past what was done. Expecting instant wins from cooking for you is unrealistic on her part. Just keep putting yourself first and don't try to rush or force it.", "Hmmm... ESH, you less so overall but more so in this moment. \n\nYou don't have to forgive your mother for abusing you when you were a child, but you can, if you choose to. What you can't do is keep your mother close to punish her, and whether you mean to or not that seems to be what's happening here. \n\nIf there is nothing she can do to earn your forgiveness, then you have no reason to maintain any contact with her. All you do by allowing her to try is punish her - and maybe she deserves it. Maybe she *should* have to experience constant rejection and refusal of affection like she subjected you to. \n\nBut you don't deserve to be her karmic retribution. You don't deserve to be someone who screams at your family and lives in constant strife and fighting.   To quote somebody (can't for the life of me remember who), your resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die. \n\nIf you can't bear a relationship with your mother, you need to cut contact with her. If you can't bear to cut her off, you need to figure out how to tolerate her. You can't keep her around as an emotional punching bag.", "YTA a little...assuming you have some kind of relationship with her currently, it's bad form to just go off on her because of who she was in the past.  You either need to talk to her about boundaries, what makes you uncomfortable, etc. or just be NC with her altogether.  Sounds like she's trying to be nice and if she doesn't understand you don't want that from her, how is she to know her actions are upsetting you? Communicate, you are within your right to set boundaries.  But give her the chance to follow your rules.", "ESH. You obviously have a lot of unresolved trauma from your early years with your mother and you haven't forgiven her. See a therapist and see if this is something you can move past. If not, you will punish your mother forever.\n\nShe's also the AH for being abusive while you were growing up.", "YTA.  We're not here to judge your mother's parenting in your childhood.  You're here asking about your current behviour. \n\nIf you can't move on from the past, then break off the relationship.

We just moved to the united states, my father left us to do \"business\" overseas. He's a business man. She wanted him to stay and make sure home was taken care of first but he didn't want to do that so he left. He believed money could solve everything, he never took care of our immigration status we were here on a tourist visa. His business ventures failed, went broke and he never came back, he refused to work like a normal person. Our visas eventually expired and we were now in the country illegally.\n\nHe died overseas of cancer and we never even went to his funeral. She chose not to go because our visas had expired and we were now of illegal status meaning there's no return to the united states if we left, she chose to just let him go and build towards our future. She believed we had a better future in the united states. My grandmother also died and we didn't go see her.\n\nOver the next years, she was basically a single mother of illegal status barely speaking english.\n\nI was having a difficult time in school, I was very scared, felt unsafe. I went to a bad school as well and was picked on. I just felt unsafe overall, became depressed and she was everything to me at this point. I think what annoyed her was that I was depressed and she said often \"what the hell could you be stressed about? Im the one with the weight\". She was very annoyed with me being depressed, saying she hated seeing my pathetic sad face.\n\nI do remember she tried to ask me what was wrong, I didn't tell her. She also asked my school if they knew anything they said they didnt notice anything. I was too afraid to tell her what was going on at school or anything at all and you can kinda imagine why. I think she got the perception from this that I was being disobedient or something or just giving her extra stress.\n\nI remember I loved her more than anything, she was literally all I had left so when she became abusive it just broke my heart I think. I think that's why I have to much emphasis on my mom and not my deadbeat dad because once he was out of the picture, she was the one person who must not let me down.\n\nI feel like a complete selfish asshole even having the audacity to even complain when obviously she's had a really difficult life. She has trauma of her own and I can tell because she goes on these rants about my father, how he wouldn't listen, how she told him repeatedly to do this and that and he wouldn't listen. She goes on non-stop. We're all traumatized people in this family.\n\nWhen I think about it logically it's like yeah dude man the fuck up and be the bigger man but goddamn at the same time I didn't do anything to deserve it. My parents fucked up, not me. A child deserve a safe home and loving available parents, no?

It's only harming YOU. \n\nTherapy can free you from this pain. Don't do it for her, or for you to accept her changes. Because  you NEVER have to if you don't want to. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the pain you feel is like shrapnel from a bomb. The bomb is gone. The explosion is done. The pain from the shrapnel is not hurting the bombs feelings or getting back at the bomb. It's only causing YOU pain. And, that pain can stop. \n\nI'm not saying you won't have scars, but I'm saying those acute feelings can subside through therapy.", "That's awful, OP. I completely agree, that is not a real apology. Apology means you take accountability for your actions, and that means recognizing when you've done wrong. That's probably worse than not apologizing in the first place.", "Okay so...she doesn't want to own her mistakes.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with going low/no contact.  I forgot to add it above, but you're most definitely not ta.", "I'm sorry for what you had to deal with.  It's not fair when our parents, whose job it is  to give us a good start in life, do a really bad job of it.\n\nI think it's more than fair to tell your mom you feel this way sometimes, maybe have a talk about it...maybe the two of you can have a couple of sessions of counselling where you can tell her the feelings you sometimes carry with you.  If she cares, she'll want to hear it.  On your own, you can also get some help in moving past the anger if you want to continue a relationship with her.   I really wish you the best :)", "I think it's an understandable reaction to very real pain. But who is that pain serving? You've showed her your pain and her response is what it is. So it's not benefitting you or anyone else anymore. It's actively harming only you. \n\nTherapy can untangle that and allow it to dissipate.", "I think if you want to continue to have a relationship with your mother you have to find a way to forgive her and to work through the trauma that your upbringing gave you. You\u2019ve listed many reasons to give her some grace and you say she\u2019s trying, but you are allowed to not be ready to forgive her yet. \n\nYou are allowed your feelings, but it might be healthier to talk them out with a therapist so that conversations with your mother can be more constructive and redemptive as opposed to just vomiting your feelings in a hurtful way. \n\nBut that\u2019s if you want to continue to reconcile. If you can\u2019t be around each other without hurting each other, then perhaps you should go even lower contact until you process your feelings.", ">When I think about it logically it's like yeah dude man the fuck up and be the bigger man but goddamn at the same time I didn't do anything to deserve it. \n\nYour mom didn't do anything to deserve what your dad did to all of you, agreed?  See how that works.  She did what she could do under the worst possible circumstances given to someone.  To sit there and say that \"your parents\" fucked up is just stupid especially after you make this reply stating how much your mother had to go through raising you and your brother in the circumstances that your dad left you ALL in.  Your **DAD** fucked up, why are you holding your mother accountable for his actions?  You even said that she reached out and tried to help (even called ths school to see if there was anything that could be done)but YOU kept quiet.  And you're blaming her for your failure to speak up.  She WAS trying.  Do you honestly believe that what happened to you was because your mother wanted it to?!?!  If this doesn't open your eyes, then Godspeed on your journey through life.  \n\n*My parents fucked up, not me. A child deserve a safe home and loving available parents, no?*\n\n*I feel like a complete selfish asshole even having the audacity to even complain when obviously she's had a really difficult life*\n\nThis right here is the crux.  You're contradicting yourself.  You want to hate your mother because she was the only one there but then you praise her by saying she is so strong and able to pull off raising you and your brother.  In a perfect world every child would have that.  But we live in today's world and have to do with what we got.  Again, how is your mom responsible for that.  You seem to be putting a lot on your mom that she doesn't deserve.  Your mother loves you. If she didn't why was she trying to be there for her son when he's sick.  I mean, honestly who doesn't like a good homecooked meal.  You're not young now and you know that she loves you and is STILL to this day trying to be the mother that you hold in our head.  Stop blaming your mom.  Honestly, what is the end game of your approach to this.  Do you want to go NC with your mom and never hear from her again?  Honestly, what is the purpose of YOUR actions?", "That's what I'm trying to find out.  It seems to me that OP is adamant about hating his mother when she is calling him when he's sick and offering a home cooked meal.  Just trying to get more info into the past that OP is using as a basis to shun his mother.\n\nAlso, when a child does something wrong, a parent is more than likely to get a little heated and yell at said child.  That is not abuse.  If the mother was yelling at OP just because it was 1:23PM in the afternoon, then yeah, that's abuse.  But it's not abuse when it CAN be considered discipline.  Just trying to figure out if it was discipline or abuse.", "Thanks. I think I really do need therapy. People have been telling me for a long time to do it but I just thought it would either go away or I could somehow resolve it on my own. I probably do need professional help", "Yes she didn't deserve how my father treated her but she was an adult. She chose my father. She was in control on how she wants to react off of that. Take it out on their kids or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Honestly, what is the end game of your approach to this.  Do you want togo NC with your mom and never hear from her again?  Honestly, what isthe purpose of YOUR actions?\n\nI don't know what my purpose is. Im too emotionally detached and drained to understand anything. Maybe I just want her to suffer, that she doesnt deserve my love and now it's my turn to punish her. You didn't give me love back then, now you don't get love its time for my revenge and you will die alone. That's her punishment, that every action has consequences. Logically, I dont think if I played it down this road it would make me happy in the end. I will probably die a bitter man.\n\nIve also thought about this is that perhaps I'm a loser who failed at life and is blaming her as a coping mechanism. Much easier to just blame ur parents instead of owning it up. I didnt hate her that much until my 30s. Now that I feel like im a loser who failed at every metric my mind just tells me it's all her fault, it's all her goddamn fault.\n\nI dont know. I just know im very angry.
