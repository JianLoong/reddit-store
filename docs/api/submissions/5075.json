It was insanely stressful for them to try to learn online, read online, do homework online, do tests online. They aren't doing well. But taking the internet away from them suddenly causes even more anxiety. They got used to spending 10-12 hour days online. Many students no longer know how to socialize, no longer know how to cope with doing school not online, want things to go back online because it is absolutely exhausting for them to have to leave the house for 8-9 hours a day and act like they like wearing pants and know what to do with their hands. They aren't old enough to really remember what life was like before COVID. All of their coping mechanisms involve the internet.\n\nHe is doing well academically, and has a solid chance of going to a great university.

And that\u2019s OKAY. Unless your son decides he wants to pursue English Literature, he\u2019s literally fine. It\u2019s very rare that any other course of study is going to force people to read Jane Austen. \n\nAlso it\u2019s not really on you to police what he does in his free time.

And that after the last third of his freshman year, his whole sophomore year, and likely part of his junior year were flat-out hosed by the pandemic, NTI, and (if lucky) hybrid classes?  He is doing just fine.  And to get that extra .7 on the GPA, he had to be taking more AP classes than the Lit one.  That means he has a lot of schoolwork that just doesn't leave a lot of time for reading anything he just isn't required to.  \n\nBesides, Pride and Prejudice is difficult reading from a decoding standpoint.  The vocabulary and syntax are just different.  Add in ADHD, and I'm not surprised he is having a hard time.  \n\nHolding college funding over his head is not going to help - and will cause a lot of harm.\n\nAs a practical matter, is the ADHD officially diagnosed by a medical professional or does he have an IEP/504 that lists the diagnosis?  Hear me out.  If your son has an official diagnosis or IEP that lists audiobooks as an accommodation or has a diagnosis that is some kind of printed matter reading difficulty, he can get set up for [Learning Ally](https://learningally.org/About-Us/Overview).  They used to call themselves Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic.  I pay $130 a year for my learning-disabled daughters and they can download all the audiobooks they want and need.", "Yta. You found a ridiculous loophole and weaponized it, all the while dismissing that he's very intelligent. He seems smarter and more mature than you too.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m a bookseller and editor, and obviously I love it when people read. And *Pride and Prejudice* is one of my favourite books.\n\nBut reading isn\u2019t easy or fun for everyone. We didn\u2019t evolve to do it (it\u2019s an entirely learned behaviour). For some folks it\u2019s a chore, so when they\u2019re choosing leisure activities, they won\u2019t read. And reading assigned books you don\u2019t enjoy is rarely pleasurable. Finally, much of what your son does online requires reading skills. All reading is good reading in that it uses and reinforces the same neurological pathways. \n\nTruly, your son might better understand and enjoy P&P if he also watches the 1995 miniseries or reads a graphic version, because he can pick up the emotional and sociological content instead of having to focus on language processing\u2014and this will support his understanding of the language as well. (Georgian lit is not easy reading for many modern young people. Austen\u2019s sentence structure is...a lot. As a nonfiction editor, I often have to urge my authors to resist very long compound sentences.)\n\nDo not expect to have a good relationship with your son if you micromanage his leisure.\n\nAlso, your son is in AP lit and his SAT language score is really very good\u2014the 2020 average in reading and writing was 528, so 710 is excellent. It puts him in about the top 7% of scores. So I think you need to revise your understanding of \u2018not great.\u2019", "YTA... \n\n\nI LITERALLY spend hours on my phone...... READING!\n\nI have the kindle app and that's the major reason I use my  phone... \n\n\nEven if he doesn't read why is that an issue? He's done well in school and got into college!!!", "What bizarre logic. Plenty of university students excel and do just fine without reading outside of coursework. Source: a university student. \n\nYTA.", "First off what exactly is he wanting to major in? If it\u2019s something technical such as science or engineering, then him struggling with something like Pride and Prejudice is not going to be a big deal. Frankly, the reason why he struggled with that title is because he is not interested in the content of that book. If he is planning on majoring in something that is technical (Law, science, and engineering), then he will not have a problem if he is interested in technical reading.\n\nFor example: I (28M) enjoy reading things that are non-fiction, and cover historical events or describe how things work. I went to college and studied Aviation Sciences, and became a pilot. A lot of the reading that I did was technical in nature, and even though I was scoring a C average in English literature in high school, when it came to my college classes where the reading was technical in nature, it was an easy A. Reading a literary work and trying to describe a character\u2019s feelings is going to require a different type of reading when compared to reading and understanding a systems manual for a 630,000 pound (286,000 KG) jet airliner, or being able read and interpret laws and regulations. As a result, I ended up taking the lowest level English literature class I could take and still get credit for to satisfy my degree requirements, which is what your son will likely do when he goes to college. \n\nI\u2019m leaning slightly towards YTA, and here is why. First I believe that you are under no obligation to pay for your sons college, but it is commendable that you are will to help pay for it or out right paying for it. Now for the part that makes me lean toward why you would be TA: \n\n1. He is telling you he is burned out. Part of being a good college student/ being a professional in a field is being able to manage burn out, he needs to figure out how to do this now if he is going to succeed and live a happy and healthy life. Putting additional academic work on him is not going to help, and it might actually make his grades in school worse.\n\n2. It doesn\u2019t sound like you have asked him what content he is consuming on his phone/ YouTube. While yes there is plenty of mind numbing garbage on the internet, there is a lot of educational and important information that is out on the internet/YouTube. You have access to up to date information on your career field, News stories from independent journalists, articles about new discoveries, and exposure to different cultures. But with this in mind, it is also important to consider that consuming content that is pure entertainment in nature is a way to step away and reduce burn out, it\u2019s healthy in moderation.\n\nAs a note, based on the information that you gave about the SAT scores, it sounds like your son might be looking at a career that is in the STEM field.", "YTA, if he excels in a high school academic setting he can definitely excel in college. Academics and standardized tests usually aren\u2019t too friendly towards people with ADHD and other neurodiversities, so the fact that he\u2019s crushing currently is a huge vote of confidence (there are so many smart kids/people that aren\u2019t great test takers). As a recent college grad, the material will be fine for him and he\u2019ll most likely continue to have high achieving academics. Plus, even if he is weaker in one area (which really doesn\u2019t even seem to be the case), the choice of your major definitely can help you avoid taking classes that are uninteresting and difficult. My guess is you wouldn\u2019t approve of him being an English Literature major anyways.", "YTA. Some people read, some don't.\n\nI am a huge reader, but school was NOT good or easy for me. I hated reading the \"classics\" for school.

Not to mention the fact that, even accounting for the How old it is, the stuff in it hasn't happened to school age kids yet! \n\nI actually recommend my kids, (yes, even my strong readers) invest in an audio version. There are various free dramatizations on Audible and a number of reasonably priced complete collections on a variety of sites. I also advise a good study guide that will support their understanding of context. I recommend the York Notes GCSE one. It's probably a bit basic for AP Literature, and it's for the British exam system, but it makes clear textual links and comparisons, has essay writing advice and revision tasks. We also watch the complete BBC mini series. Struggling with P&P is not a sign that your child isn't working hard! \n\nIf you are worried about his reading, I have to ask. How much reading do you model in the home? Do you talk about books? Debate interpretations of characters over dinner? Recommend things?

Your post reeks of ableism.", "YTA.\n\nI have ADHD, and have always struggled with reading. 3 years into college (at a T20 university), and I am successfully premed, near-perfect GPA, and currently preparing for the MCAT. Every body has different ways of learning and absorbing material. Expecting anyone to fit into the standard of neurotypical education is unfair, and honestly, ableist. Many people struggle with different things, and to deny someone access to education because of different learning styles is exactly WHY ableism is such an issue. Having difficultly with reading is not an indicator of how successful you can be. I haven't read a full novel since middle school. I got through high school by figuring out ways around my struggles, because no one tried to help. Having ADHD means you have to work twice as hard to get half as far. Your son is doing incredibly-- between his GPA, SAT scores, and everything else, you should be so proud of him. To deny him access to education is unfair.\n\nI also want to say that it's very understandable that college poses a financial strain. There is no denying that, and that's not accessible for everyone. This can be a difficult decision for a parent, and I don't want to ignore that stressor-- I get it. It's a fair consideration. I also believe that denying on the basis of reading struggles alone isn't fair. College is the time where you find what you're good at and learn what your strengths are. He will still be able to be successful if his strengths aren't reading.", "YTA- I used to love reading any book I could open. Now I only read when it relates to specific things I want to know about or for work/training  reasons.

I mean, is it really that big of deal?!", "Yes, of course YTA. Either help him with university or don't, but don't demand that he read outside of schoolwork as a requirement unless you really want him to hate reading.\n\nFor the record, a lot of the stuff I was required to read in high school I did not enjoy, and that did not even remotely hamper my ability to go to university.

He\u2019s maintaining a 4.7 GPA (which, in case you forgot, is on a scale of ONE THROUGH FOUR), has straight A\u2019s in class, AND is doing extracurriculars. That\u2019s more than enough to earn a full ride scholarship in a ton of non-ivy league school, and I\u2019d wager even a few Ivy League ones too. \n\nIf he\u2019s burn out, he needs a break. Have him apply and enroll for Spring 2024 (which begins in January, in my experience), so he can have some time off from school before starting college. Even better- let him work a part time (or even full time) job during the gap to save some money for college (for spending or otherwise). \n\nI graduated in 2020 with a 3.2 GPA, and wound up taking two years off from school to work and save for college, as my parents had recently split and wouldn\u2019t have the means to fully support me. Now I\u2019ll be starting in my state college in January with my own car. Also, as it turns out, I\u2019ll be getting a refund from my school, because my scholarships and grants cover more than the cost of attendance. And that\u2019s with my 3.2 GPA. I also have a clear plan of which job I want to pursue, which major I\u2019ll need to pursue it, and the steps I need to take to get where I want to go, BECAUSE I took the time off to look around and think about what I wanted out of life.\n\nI understand your concern for your child\u2019s future, and I\u2019m sure you want the best for him, but he will have to decide what\u2019s best on his own. Don\u2019t forget; you go to college to get a career. The average college freshman will change their major about four times before settling on a career path, or so I\u2019ve been told. Your son will probably be able to skip most of his Gen-Ed\u2019s and probably some prereqs too, with his current academic prowess. Those classes already make up most peoples\u2019 freshman year of college. \n\nI\u2019d have a serious discussion about the source of his academic burnout. See if he can stick it out for the rest of the year and finish high school off strong, and give him a break afterwards. That\u2019ll give him some time to think about what he wants to pursue, and have a discussion about how it\u2019ll be financed (though, chances are, it\u2019ll be covered with some scholarships and/or grants), and find a college that has a good program in his chosen field. Having him fully  burnt out in college will only lead to him not working, and eventually flunking out. Nobody wants that.\n\nEdit to add: as for the whole phone/YouTube thing, as a fellow Gen Z-er, it\u2019s probably just escapism on his part. If he isn\u2019t happy, which he very well might not be if he\u2019s that burnt out, he\u2019s probably using his phone as a means to escape from those negative thoughts/emotions.

YTA. In fact, you\u2019re a monster. How dare you place additional expectations on him?", "YTA", "\u201cIt\u2019s his phone!!\u201d Oh please that excuse is so 2010.\n\nYTA", "YTA .  My 18 year old daughter was diagnosed with mild dyslexia when she was 15  - she learned to read before she started school, is an excellent student, etc, but didn\u2019t enjoy reading for leisure.  It wasn\u2019t until she mentioned words moving around on the page (this was normal for her) that we got her assessed.  I felt awful that I hadn\u2019t noticed any signs before then, and neither had her teachers.  She\u2019s about to go to University (we are in Australia) and will be fine.  The reason I mention this is because your son might also be dyslexic on top of his other diagnosis.  Or maybe he doesn\u2019t enjoy reading Jane Austen?  In any event, don\u2019t limit his potential and blame his screen time (which is normal for a kid that age).  Have a talk with his teacher, see what they think.  Have a talk with your son - and listen to him instead of dismissing him out of hand.", "YTA to dad. Especially at the update. You wrote the post, Daddy dearest, and then you say your kid biased it in his favor? Accept you're an asshole. Digest your shame and mend your ways.", "YTA. I\u2019m a reader. I love books and I love Pride and Prejudice. My aunt gave it to me when I was 13. I tried to read it then. I tried again at 18, and at 25. I gave it to my sister who raved about it and gave it back to me and badgered me until I was well into my 30s when I finally tackled it. It\u2019s a brilliant book that isn\u2019t going to interest a teenage boy for crying out loud. \nYou have gifted son, who is clearly college material and you want to hobble his earning potential for life over Pride and Prejudice? \nWhat\u2019s wrong with you?", "Asked him to, and he said he didn\u2019t need to prove anything to me, lol. Whatever that means", "Jane Austen wrote during the Napoleonic Wars and its immediate aftermath (regency period) - thus she is a nineteenth century writer ;) I have both lit & history degrees, sorry...\n\nP&P was delightful - and it has one of the top ten or twenty opening lines of any English novel! Its Northanger Abbey that I found not as amusing as it was a spoof of Gothics.", "Sounds like your dad really needs to grow up and learn how to handle his emotions.", "Did we help you settle it? I didn't read all the posts but it sounds like everyone was TEAM SON on this one.  Does great in school and is also a normal teen who likes his phone.  Not seeing the problem here.  Dad - YTA", "Sounds like he knows he's wrong and is ego-bruised.", "I find this funny because the hobbit is children's literature.", "I\u2019ve hit the point where basically all my \u201creading\u201d is audiobooks from the library. I don\u2019t count it as real reading since I\u2019m not using my eyes or reading super close like I would have when I was younger. But my commute is anywhere from 1 to 1.5 hours a day and it makes the traffic so much better. Plus, at least I know enough about the plot I can participate in my book club.", "I thought similarly until I thought, we wouldn\u2019t tell blind people they didn\u2019t read a book just because they didn\u2019t use their eyes, so why doesn\u2019t it count as reading for us too.", "You're not wrong. Hence the decade of not reading books after."]}
