NTA", "The friends didn\u2019t originally want the item. OP offered it to them randomly, they didn\u2019t ask for it.

That\u2019s not entitlement lol.", "Thank you, I\u2019m glad at least some people here have their heads screwed straight.", "This.

It\u2019s rude to put a guest in the awkward position of saying no to your sales pitch. Op asking his guests if they\u2019ll buy this toaster or whatever it is off of him also makes it seem like he might need the money urgently, so they\u2019ll feel pressured as friends of his to buy it to help him out even though they don\u2019t want it.", "Also aren't the friends taking it for free also and also an example of taking advantage of your friends?", "I agree. NTA. As a thought experiment, let\u2019s just up the value of the item here: let\u2019s say you win a car. You technically got that car for free, right? But you already have two cars and no more space in your garage, so you decide to sell the car you won to make a profit... is anyone in this scenario actually giving their friend a free freaking car? Especially if the friend doesn\u2019t NEED a car? If this were the case for me, I would sell it at a discounted rate to my friend, but unless they were in desperate need of a car, I ain\u2019t giving away a whole ass car for free. This entire principle of \u201coh, you got that for free, so you can\u2019t be selling it to a friend to make a profit\u201d is nonsense.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that I also would never expect my friend to give me something for free, regardless of what they paid or did not pay for it.\n\nEdit 2: Someone else made a solid counter argument, so I retract the above argument, but still agree with NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect handouts from friends just because they can. It\u2019s certainly nice when a friend gives you something, but again, I would not expect my friend to give me something (especially something with a $160 value) for free. OP offered 25% off the total item value, and I think this is fair. I would not be mad if a friend offered me this deal.\n\nEdit 3: I actually think NAH. Friends were disappointed. They are allowed to feel that way, but I also don\u2019t think OP was wrong for wanting to sell the item to them.

But you might also be someone who would proactively offer money.\n\nOP\u2019s friend walked away empty handed in the end so even taking the dejected remark into account, they didn\u2019t try to keep it or act entitled.

No. But it does enrich the friends for $160 and leaves OP at a Net zero position.\n\nOP selling to the friends for $120 is a win-win situation from an economic standpoint.

Everyone is better off than when they started.\n\nI said in a stand-alone comment, but I see this as a NAH. I understand the friends position, but $120 has meaningful value to some people. If OP needs the $120, then the friends expecting OP to forfeit what they intended to sell online is not reasonable.

They intend to sell it online at a 25% discount for $120, and they\u2019re giving the friend the right of first refusal. \n\nThis is classic game theory. OP is neutral between selling online or to friend, and receives $120 either way. Friends ideal outcome is to receive product for free (160 value), and the friends adverse outcome is to pay $120 for the product (160 - 120 = 40 net value).\n\nThe equilibrium outcome here would be the deal OP offered. The net value to the friend would need to be tweaked depending on what utility value the friend ascribes to the product in question.

Personally speaking if someone offered something for free that I can remotely use I would accept it but if someone offered something I can possibly use for money I would have to consider the costs/benefit for myself. If I misunderstood and assumed something was free but then realized I need to pay it would be normal for me to lose immediate interest/excitement and I would say I'll get back to you.

Which tbh could be the difference between a YTA and NTA on the fact that he solicited the sale unprompted imo. There's a difference between \"Hey, I got this thing you've showed interest in purchasing and am selling it at a discount, do you want it\" or \"Hey, I got this thing that basically everyone wants but not everyone wants to pay the price for, are you interested in purchasing it from me at a discount\" or \"I got this ultra specific item from Amazon for free that you may not be actually interested in that you've never showed interest before, do you want to buy it from me?

I was going to list the item on marketplace for maybe half retail price, but would you like to buy it from us?\" then they'd be NTA.

(Think brands like Mulberry, Timberland, Musto, Gudrun Sjoden and MORE).\n\nWe get asked to reduce the price of things, let's say a pair of trousers. The customer will try to barter, maybe by saying \"Well, you got it for free, so you can sell it to me for less than you are asking.\"\n\nMy answer is: this item was donated to us by someone who wants to help us raise money for the charity. We have an obligation to that person to charge what we think we can achieve. Imagine if you donated a leather jacket, worth \u00a3200 to a charity. And then you saw that they were selling it for \u00a320. Wouldn't you be upset? I sure would be ! And I'd think that charity didn't know what they were doing price-wise, and I would NOT donate to them again. I'd give my stuff to someone who knew the value of it.\n\nWe got a leather jacket donated to us once. I looked the brand up online, and it originally sold for \u00a3300. It was nearly new, hardly worn at all. We charged \u00a3175, and it sold within 2 days, to a woman who was VERY happy indeed with her purchase.\n\nI had customers telling me it was unethical and greedy to charge so much. So how much SHOULD we have charged, \u00a35? Not a chance.\n\n(I know not everyone agrees with charity shops pricing things for more than a few quid, but I hope my explanation goes someway to perhaps changing this view).", "I agree with NAH.

If it was an item more expensive, like 1000$, maybe I\u2019d expect a bigger discount as a friend, but the value is kinda low from the start.

You don't treat your friends the same way you treat everyone else.", "Id be down if it was at a %50 discount. We both win then and get half off a new thing but only $40 off of $160 on something they got free is not a good deal at all.", "the difference? one is a completely random windfall that I don't need and would be annoying to me to sell and ship or meet up with some stranger to exchange it when I could just give it to a friend and its not going to make or break my life. \n\nthe other is something that belonged to someone I knew and cared about who thought enough of me to leave me some of their things when they passed either to remember them by or simply pass on their wealth to someone they cared about. \n\nits a totally different situation in which someone I know worked hard and acquired something and then gave it to me and it holds meaning because of that... the fact you'd compare this to a double shipped item from amazon is honestly borderline sociopathic imo...", "Why did they even have to offer it to begin with?! Just so fing random to bring you as they were leaving.", "Cool, then do that online instead of trying to hustle friends on the spot as they're leaving. Although something tells me they won't hang out again.", "It sounds a lot more like it went\n\n\u201cHey do you want this?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure\u201d\n\n\u201cCool, it\u2019s $120\u201d\n\nConsidering \u201cthat\u2019s really nice of you to be giving us this\u201d doesn\u2019t make any sense as a response to \u201chey do you want to buy this\u201d", "Nobody is talking about \u201centitlement\u201d, it\u2019s about giving a gift to a friend.  You\u2019re being too transactional", "If it's sold too cheap flippers just buy it and put it on ebay while the charity loses out and the poor person you're imagining buying it still never sees it. Charity shops can't win now.", "I think what they\u2019re saying is their charity shops are similar to a business donating items to a charity auction. They\u2019re donating to help raise money, the item being bought is bought by people raising money not the needy. It\u2019s a totally different thing than the thrift shops we have in the US.", "So it\u2019s not about it being free then. You think you should just give items you don\u2019t care about away to friends rather than sell them?", "This! I always gift things to my friends that they need that I don't use! And anything like this situation my first thought is which one of my friends could use this free item since I got two? I like to keep my friends and even my coworkers I like in my mind for anything that can help them in life I can offer. I don't necessarily expect everybody to be like this, but it is confusing to me."]}
