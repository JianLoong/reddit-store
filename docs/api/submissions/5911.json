They deserve your public support for \u201cgrey area\u201d matters like this, at least until you\u2019ve fully resolved it between you. \n\nWhat are the facts?\n\n- you have item you don\u2019t want / need\n\n- you can easily sell that item on eBay and make $amount\n\n- random people who want that item will pay that amount, because it\u2019s worth it \n\n- you offered your friends the same deal\n\n- they weren\u2019t interested \n\nIf you gave them an item that would earn you a certain amount of money, that\u2019s *exactly the same as if you gave them that amount of cash for no reason*. \n\nWould you have handed over $120 to them yesterday for no reason?\n\nThey are being ridiculously entitled to think they deserve it for free. \n\nThe only possible subtlety is if you were planning to LIST it hoping for bidding to reach that price but would accept a lower offer. In which case you were trying to get more than the market would pay for it from your friends, which is cheeky & rude. The conversation would have looked more like: make me a reasonable offer, let\u2019s discuss. \n\nBut you\u2019re NTA for refusing to give them (the equivalent of) money for free.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Calling them greedy is like saying if they found $100, that they should give it to a friend instead of keeping it.", "It\u2019s actually entitled of friend to expect OP to give it away for free, even if the item was free. Though OP could have offer to sell for half the price rather than the quoted price, sort of split the cost idea someone suggested", "They weren't obligated to give it, but to ask a friend to buy something is weird. It's not like the friend asked for it first or anything.", "That\u2019s what makes them TA.  Basically said, \u201cI got this item for free would you like to buy it?\u201c Who\u2019s going to take that offer?", "> nothing is free in this world\n\nThey literally got the item for free.", "Do you regularly walk your friends around your place and show them things, then ask if they would like it, they could buy it at a good price? That's just fucking tacky.\n\nIf your friends express interest, that's one thing, but don't offer to sell them your shit unasked. Tell them you got one free and are selling it on the marketplace, and if they really want it, they will offer to buy it.", "Yea I\u2019m really surprised, like this is kind of a nice thing to do already to sell at discount when you might get like near full price on eBay. And it\u2019s like when people resell their gifts and people get huffy because you got it for free - like that doesn\u2019t mean you get to have it for free?", "A lot of times big companies just tell you to keep them, I\u2019ve had it happen", "Says who? I would never not consider paying a friend especially since they are selling at a discount.", "How are they losing the $120 when they never paid for the item in the first place ?", "The friend didn't ask for it. They didn't say they wanted it. They didn't indicate it was this awesome thing they were going to buy.\n\nThe friend said \"look at this thing that I totally got for free from Amazon, you want it?\". At that point, the friend isn't going to be expecting to pay for it, why would you offer something to someone who has shown no interest in acquiring it from you unless it was free?\n\nDo you regularly collect things you don't need or intend to sell and show them to your friends and offer them a deal? Are your friendships like a big garage sale?", "Basically \"buy this one so I can have mine for free\" or essentially $40 because that was the \"discount\"", "Shipping and handling", "Your hypothetical doesn\u2019t match the scenario. No, of course I don\u2019t.\n\nAgree on your second paragraph 100% and thought the friends had expressed interest.", "How much someone should sell something they own is not wholly dependent on how much they get for it. There\u2019re things people got for close to nothing and sold for a fortune and there\u2019re things people got with a fortune and sold for close to nothing.", "Because they can earn $120 on Marketplace!\n\nSame as an old chair you found on the side of the road! Turns out to be worth something. Should they give it away because it was free?\n\nThey are losing $120!", "Yeah I\u2019ve had ppl do this to me before. Frame it like they are giving me something, I say ok I\u2019ll take it, then try to get me to pay. It\u2019s so awkward.", "Yes the friend didn\u2019t ask for it, they were offered to buy over from OP but expected it to be free after hearing how OP gotten it. How is that not entitled?\n\nNot saying what OP did was right, trying to profit off a friend, but friend\u2019s mentality isn\u2019t right either. \n\nNot sure how you derive my friendship with people is a garage sale, you need to keep the discussion to OP and friend and not attack others with differing views", "Yes but in this case they paid nothing , and want to sell it for close to full price which is likely not to sell on marketplace anyway. Maybe if they spend 5+ hours entertaining lowball offers they might find something.", "Well who knows if it in fact sells for $120? There might be no takers at asking price. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s best not to sell stuff to friends. Just offer it on marketplace and be done with it. If you do offer it to your friend, you have to apologize carefully that you can\u2019t offer much of a discount because you need the money etc.", "Exactly!\n\nOr say this is on Marketplace for X if they wanted it!"]}
