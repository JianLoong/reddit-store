Caregiver thinks they are being attentive, helpful, disciplined, and positioned to help get eating back on track if problems crop up. I think one of the reasons this doesn\u2019t work is because with some ED, from my personal perspective, all the person does is think about food, how little or how much, how many calories, how much exercise would be needed to work it off. Some eating disorders are about extreme, extreme control for the person with the disorder. So breaking out of the disorder means learning *not* to be obsessively controlling about food, *not* to think about calories all the time. So the caregiver asking about calories or food or what was eaten today is asking the person with the disorder to engage in the kind of focus and thinking about food that isn\u2019t helpful or positive, but is actually getting the person to take the first step in a series of steps that is part of their disorder.\n\nMaybe this isn\u2019t the best analogy, but it\u2019s like putting a bottle of whiskey in front of an alcohol and asking, \u201cdid you drink this today\u201d?

Thinking that much about alcohol wouldn\u2019t be problematic for a nonalcoholic, but for a person in recovery, that really wouldn\u2019t be helpful.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s possible your GF just doesn\u2019t understand that too much focusing on food is precisely the negative thinking involved for people with ED.

That\u2019s how it should be and a very refreshing thing to see from a parent on this thread.", "Definitely, NTA. While your girlfriend seems to have good intentions, eating disorders are a mental illness and it seems like she is neglecting that aspect of it. I have an ED and I spent my summer in a residential treatment facility and ~ let me tell you~ the act of physically eating is just the first step of a very very complex and long recovery process. Everyone has different triggers and it isn\u2019t up to her to decide whether she agrees with the boundaries that you and your daughter set and whether she deems the triggers to be legitimate. My heart breaks for everyone involved: your daughter, you, your girlfriend. EDs affect everyone around them and a lot of time people want so desperately to help but aren\u2019t sure how. Diet culture is so pervasive that I think a lot of people without EDs feel comfortable speaking on the issue because they can relate in some way, whether that is by counting calories, or compensating with exercise, etc. What they often miss is that people with EDs don\u2019t process the info the same way and that, most of the time, it both is and isn\u2019t about the food. Reducing the issue to numbers/ calories both oversimplifies and perpetuates the problem! General consensus is NO NUMBERS (blind weigh-ins, cover or remove nutritional info, flexibility around quantity/ time of day to eat, etc)\nI\u2019d recommend your girlfriend read \u201cThe 8 Keys\u201d by Carolyn Costin (founder of Monte Nido Treatment Centers) to better understand the realities of what recovery looks like. I found myself thinking \u201cdamn, they found a way to put it into words\u201d countless times while reading it. Also \u201cAnti Diet\u201d by Christy Harrison, which is an in depth criticism of diet culture. My nutritionist recommended it to me and it\u2019s been a great resource to help fact check and promote the concept of Health at Every Size! \nI hope this has helped! And thank you for being such a strong advocate for your daughter and treating this issue with the severity it deserves. Have you guys considered looking into an IOP or PHP program? Or even residential would be a good option if a good fit. The support systems and friendships made through these programs are a highly motivating factor in recovery!", "NTA ED is so serious and complicated that for your gf to continuously butt in on this situation is unforgivable. Your going to need to keep her away from your daughter. Continue to follow the doctor\u2019s advice. You\u2019re doing a great job. Hang in there", "Hard NTA. The gf might have meant well, but you told her what your daughter's needs regarding her ED were more than once and her attempt to help was done in a way that could have easily relapsed those disordered habits.", "NTA - I\u2019m in recovery and it sounds like your daughter has a great dr. All of those things would have triggered me to want to sneak and hide things not make me feel like eating more. You\u2019re doing the best you can with the situation you\u2019ve been given.

Even while in recovery. \n\nDo I think your girlfriend was being malicious? No\n\n I do think she figured she knew better than your doctor's professional care team and felt an aggressive approach should be taken (which never should be taken that's how a relapse happens) and did not want to listen because she believes she knows better.\n\nI think you did the right thing telling her to leave, her way of \"helping\" is a threat to your daughter's health and well being in general.

Your gf\u2019s actions are invasive and pushy, kinda taking control away from your daughter.", "NTA. Your GF's behavior is so triggering and inappropriate, and she has no standing here. Even if she disagrees with your parenting choices, this is your child. And you are following doctor's orders based on sound research. You are absolutely handling this the right way. Forced recoveries are incredibly ineffective, statistically. Your suggestions of what your GF could do instead were perfect suggestions.\n\nI just want to say to please be aware that your daughter may feel like her ED caused this rift between you and your GF and feel responsible for it, and this may also be triggering for her. I definitely recommend telling her therapist about what happened with the GF, just so the therapist knows, and making it explicitly clear to your daughter that this is not her fault, and was an issue between you and the GF that would have come up in some way or another no matter what. \n\nYour GF disregarded professional advice to instead just do whatever she thought best, even though you had already spoken to her about how dangerous that was. She then refused to take any responsibility for her actions and claimed what she was doing was actually good, despite professional guidance and explanations from you that it was actually harmful. That self-righteous reckless behavior combined with stubbornness and entitlement would've become an issue about something else eventually if not your daughter's ED.\n\nIt's natural that your daughter may blame herself, whether this is just a fight or becomes a breakup. So don't focus on trying to prevent that entirely, but supporting her even though she may feel that way no matter what you do. It's just how kids process stuff like this most of the time.\n\nI personally, as an ED survivor, would recommend not allowing your GF around your daughter until she has admitted her wrongdoing and utilized enough educational resources with you that you feel she truly understands what was harmful about her behavior and how to act going forward. By educational resources, I mean like online seminars, in person classes, support groups for families of kids with EDs, maybe even speaking to your daughter's doctor about ED recovery care in general (obviously I'm not suggesting the doctor share her private medical info). Your daughter's therapist may also have some resources to suggest. \n\nI'm going to assume your GF has so many redeeming traits and that this is an area where she is especially ignorant, so I understand you maybe not wanting to end the relationship over this, but I definitely am concerned about the unwillingness to believe you about your daughter's needs, the ignoring medical advice in a precarious situation, and as I mentioned before, the self-righteousness about it, the sense of entitlement to your daughter's information, and the stubbornness when you addressed this with her repeatedly. These are things that need to be worked out further, but apart from your daughter to be sure that she is not collateral damage in the process.", "No. They won't.

And if you are doing a version of FBT - let the therapist know about this to watch the weight chart jic", "They are right - you need to be patient - however, NOT at the expense of the health and wellbeing of your daughter.  \nEither the GF has some issues where she is not understanding the meaning of \"do not do it this way\" or she has a more malicious reasoning - but either way - as a good parent you do what works for your kids, and since you are following doctors/specialists guidelines - that should be good.\n\nGF (ex?) should not have tried to \"help\" (help with what, ruin her health again?) - after being explained what/why/how at least once.\n\nThe fact she continued doing this anyway shows either she is too dumb to be around a person with an ED - or she is just evil.\n\nI hope it\\`s being 'not smart enough' .. as the other option... \n\nNTA", "So what if she has personal experience?? She\u2019s been asked repetitively to stop by someone who has personal experience of *this* ED so her experience is null and void.", "I think you are doing great. \nI (f27) was diagnosed with anorexia when I was 17, and the absolute last thing I wanted to talk about was how many calories I ate. That whole thing just made me think and calculate even more. People continued to ask me if I shouldn\u2019t eat more or why I only had coffee for lunch and things like that, and it only made me not want to eat. Eventually people stopped. But I have to say that my mother (I was raise by a single mother) never said a word about it. NEVER. \nOne day I just started eating gingerbread cookie with butter on, and after that I just kept eating food and suddenly I was kind of healthy again. It was like I got tired of being hungry and started to eat and the realized that food is actually good and makes you a lot happier. \nSo just keep doing what your doing. And if your Gf doesn\u2019t understand that you only want what is best for your child, and what you are doing is to protect your child not punish her, maybe she shouldn\u2019t be your gf?", "NTA.\nYou explained and guided how it works and you have created a safe environment for your daughter and your gf just ignored it and deserved to leave.\n\nI have ED and just reading this gave me anxiety, even flashbacks. I wish one of my parents or even a sibling would have handeled it like you. Emotional support is super super important and creating safety nets. I admire your dedication to be there for your daughter and no one should come in and flipp it around. She should respect the boundaries and not think she is above them.\n\nI'm proud of you and I hope your daughter is okay\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc", "You shouldn\u2019t take the time to be patient at the expense of your daughter", "NTA!! You're a good parent and you're giving great support to your daughter. My brother and I both had EDs growing up and my parents were good with us--extended family not so much. They would constantly comment on how we overate and would tell us to count calories so we didn't get fat, they'd even go through the trash to see what we ate. That kind of behavior is unhelpful and detrimental to recovery and will ultimately strain relationships. You're doing the right thing, and best wishes for your daughter's recovery", "ED means erectile dysfunction. Dumbass.", "NTA. She did know because you clearly told her AND gave her concrete suggestions for ways to actually help! Thank you for acting swiftly and firmly. I'm sure you know EDs are nothing to fuck around about but obviously the people around you don't, so good on you for being a safe person for your daughter despite all that!", "NTA. Maybe have your gf meet the therapist to go over why what she's doing is harmful?", "Yeah I got that eventually", "Logical thinking is hard for some people\u2026\n\nYou\u2018re neither funny or creative", "NTA, you did exactly what you should have done. My twin sister had an eating disorder for 10-15 years. My parents did not do anything but sweep it under the rug. She still binges and purges to this day. We are 36, it\u2019s started at 14. She has no gag reflex so she vomits all the time even if it is not on command. Her teeth are gross from acid wear. If you are not following what the doctor and psychiatrist tell you, it will not be treated. It could continue for a long time like my sister or forever or until death. Whatever comes first. You are an amazing father. Positive reinforcement, love, support and monitoring from afar are the best possible ways to treat a mental disorder of any kind but especially ED. What your gf was doing makes her feel bad about herself and who she is and can cause depression and giving up on how far she has come. No one wants to be strictly monitored, especially at 16years old with all those hormones. It could not only make her ED relapse quite quickly, but it could be worse than it was. Good on you. Dad of the fucking year here!!!! I wish my parents would of done 1% of the 110% u put into helping your daughter.", "As someone who used to have an ED , mentioning calories can get dangerous during recovery. My boyfriend had to use a marker on the packages for me so I couldn't see them. Constantly asking her how many she's eaten can turn into extreme guilt for eating 'so many calories ' in her mind and may possibly drive her back to the ED. NTA. Tell your girlfriend if she doesn't respect the boundaries you've set your next one will be not seeing her anymore", "I think GF has a disorder of her own.   \nOne in which her nose finds itself in places it doesn't belong.\n\nNTA", "Oh I agree", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who had ED I can say that ANY questions about weight, calories or eating habits trigger a response inside you.\n\nYou recover from ED by not hyper focusing on it!\n\nBy asking questions and putting focus on the problem she may as well be practicing her ED.\n\nWhat a good father you are! I wish my dad had done the same for me.", "NTA. This is an absolute deal breaker. I would not give her anymore chances. I would just tell her it\u2019s not working out. The end. Please don\u2019t jeopardize your daughters recovery. She\u2019s had ample opportunities to stop the behavior and she hasn\u2019t. Time to part ways.", "NTA this isn't hard, she's not your daughter's parent.  She needs to follow the rules for how to treat your daughter, especially in your own home.  This is a sensitive issue and the failure to respect that is a major problem.  It's right that you pushed back and focused on what's best for your daughter.", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who had ED I can say that ANY questions about weight, calories or eating habits trigger a response inside you.\n\nYou recover from ED by not hyper focusing on it!\n\nBy asking questions and putting focus on the problem she may as well be practicing her ED.\n\nI wish my dad had done the same for me. You\u2019re a great father!\n\nYou took the time to learn what\u2019s best, while despite your requests and instructions to help your daughter, she still has not listened or read up on the subject, but does whatever she thinks is best. She says she really cares, but I really feel there\u2019s something self-absorbed and uncaring about that.\n\nHer words contradict her behaviour."]}
