You've explained to her several times that her \"helping\" isn't actually helping, I'd personally sit her down and say these are boundaries you can not cross. She's not her mother, she hasn't spoken to the doctors with you or your daughter.\n\nIf she can't respect you or you daughters boundaries then I suggest you call it a day, because all that's going to happen is she will make your daughters condition worse.\n\nYour a good dad and your daughter needs you, so step up and put your foot down.", "NTA \n\nShe knew she wasn\u2019t helping when you told her to stop the first time, she just thinks she knows better than you.", "NTA.\n\nYou are prioritising your daughter as you should be doing. And as someone who has struggled with an ED / currently working through it, such intrusive questions are very uncomfortable and might make one spiral.\n\nYour girlfriend needs to respect boundaries. And mentioning calories? It sounds like she doesn't respect you nor your daughter, and instead is trying to make it about herself so she can feel better.\n\nSome people need to get told a few times to make themselves realise that what they are doing isn't helping, but it seems like she doesn't care.", "NTA, you're doing the right thing. You explained it already to your girlfriend, yet she continues to dismiss it. She is actively risking the progress your daughter has made. If she does not understand that, she has to go.", "NTA and your girlfriend is a danger to your daughter. You NEVER EVER bring up calories to someone with an ED. Ever. \n\nEven if she didn't know, you told her, and she still went against your wishes. \n\nYour girlfriend is triggering to your daughter and may be getting some gross satisfaction over the fact she is triggering her. \n\nIf you don't cut her contact with your daughter, you would be the AH here.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t go the \u201cjust be patient\u201d route with your girlfriend. You\u2019ve told her more than once and this is your daughter\u2019s physical and mental health on the line so you don\u2019t have the luxury of being patient. Set firm rules and boundaries with your gf and if she crosses/breaks then, you know what you have to do.", "NTA - You did the right thing. Eating disorders are complex and trying to apply simple solutions, however well meaning, will likely exacerbate the problem, not fix it. \n\nYou've tried to tell her, she clearly hasn't taken it in, and you've set a very reasonable boundary.", "NTA it's your child, it sounds like you are doing exactly the right thing. Gf might be trying to be helpful but if she cant take professional direction, which is what you are following from your doctor etc,then she will ultimately do more harm than good, and kid comes first so yes, a firm stance is crucial since she obviously Is the sort to disregard polite requests.", "NTA\n\nshe absolutely did know...because you told her.\n\nShe thinks she knows better than your daughters health care team. She thinks she knows better than you.\n\nShe either needs to respect the boundaries or you need to keep her away from your daughter.", "NTA.\n\n> I was kicking her out for helping, she didn\u2019t realize she wasn\u2019t\n\nYeah, no.  Even if you hadn\u2019t already freaking **told her** in no uncertain terms that she wasn\u2019t, it shouldn\u2019t take explicit instructions from a doctor to realize that encouraging someone with an ED to *calorie count* is a really, *really*, **really** bad idea.  Do you really want to continue dating someone who\u2019s not only not equipped to handle this, but doubling down on their ignorance?", "NTA good for you! Her asking about calories is WAY over the line and unhelpful!!", "NTA \n\nYou were very clear in the best way to help your daughter and even gave her suggestions on how to help further.  She completely disregarded your instructions which were also the doctors instructions and was potentially causing your daughter more harm than good.  \n\nThe health and well being of your daughter is more important than your gf's feelings and her need to be \"helpful\".  \n\nYou did the right thing getting your daughter help and advocating and listening to professional advice and you're doing the right thing by making your GF back off.", "The 'I didn't know' doesn't work when she has been told *repeatedly* not to do what she is doing.\n\nShes not being helpful, she is being intrusive. Just because your daughter told her about her ED doesn't mean she's welcome or qualified to treat it.\n\nNTA. Your obligation as a parent is to protect your child. That is what your doing. I'd be keeping them at a distance at the very least, but ultimately this would be the nail in the coffin for me.", "NTA, you explained many times how to behave around your daughter to help with her ED. If your gf doesn't follow, she is either stupid or stubborn, in both cases - good riddance!", "NTA. And she know, because you Tell her several times. So is she make her own way to control your daughter.", "NTA, your daughter's interests are paramount. You don't need to be patient if you feel that gf does not get it. You need to be protective of your lovely daughter, and that's exactly what you're doing.\n\nI do understand that gf probably has sincere intentions, but it doesn't change the fact that she ruins the whole thing by trying to help the wrong way. I don't think you had any choice in the matter. Hopefully, you'll have a chat with gf like adults do and come to mutual understanding.  For now you set AND ENFORCED a clear boundary. It may be upsetting for gf, but if she really cares about your child, she'll accept it.", "NTA.  If you want to maintain your relationship OP, is it possible to talk GF to see your daughter\u2019s doctor and have them explain the proper way to deal with an ED? Maybe GF is one of these people who has to have something explained by an \u201cexpert\u201d before they will accept something other than their set in stone thinking.  Otherwise you are in a pickle, because I don\u2019t think GF gets it and probably won\u2019t.", "NTA. At this point, you've explained and she's overstepping. She's just not hearing you. Maybe discuss the fact that she's in therapy and this is the advice of her therapist... Healing takes time and often has needs that seem counterintuitive for people who are unfamiliar with it.", "NTA. You are following the advice of your daughter's medical professionals. It's great that you sought care for your child and are working toward a good health outcome for her; not all parents are this understanding and helpful. Your gf is not following medical directives and is overstepping. Whether or not it's out of concern or good intentions, she's not helping. And if she continues to push your child, I don't think she should be around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
