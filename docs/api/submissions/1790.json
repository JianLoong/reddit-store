It's great that you sought care for your child and are working toward a good health outcome for her; not all parents are this understanding and helpful.

It's like she *wants* to sabotage her. (I'm not saying she is - just highlighting how stupid it is.)", "I relapsed after decades when a program for diabetics came out and I decided to try it. I had to quit after 24 hours when on day one I WEIGHED MYSELF THIRTY TIMES.  I knew what was going to happen if I continued, and it was not pretty. And the company (that my insurance company contracted) was pretty furious that I wanted to quit and wouldn't let me! I did, but still. It was nuts.", " Simple as that. She doesn't have to understand to follow the orders.", "Goodness. As someone who also struggled with a restrictive ED, the moment I read \"asking how many calories\" in the original post, my eyes went WIDE. I'm 100% with you, the moment someone else starts trying to micromanage and discuss my food with me, everything just gets worse.", "OOf I'm sorry you've dealt with all that :(.\n\nReading while eating is very normal for some who don't even have food issues of any kind. My husband and I both do.\n\nWhen I was early 20s my uncle (who disappeared after Vietnam war) reappeared with a wife and son (not Vietnamese, he'd been hiding out in the Florida everglades for a couple decades). Well they visited and his son 10 years old brought a book to the table. They told him it wasn't appropriate. My parents said it was fine cause I'd always done it. lol. True, I'd talk some if something came up to talk about but I'd read the newspaper, magazines, books. \n\nHeck I'm in my 40s now and my husband jokes I'll read anything with words, which is probably 90% true. He reads a lot too.\n\nBut yea gf is a disaster waiting to happen. She doesn't respect boundaries and keeps trying to do her own thing regardless of the harm she can cause, that's not someone you want around.", "Your comment really hit home. I still struggle from time to time and it's very hard to imagine trying to stay healthy with someone like OPs girlfriend around. \n\nOP is doing everything he can for his daughter which I absolutely recognize and appreciate. The fact that the girlfriend is doing calorie checking?? That made my stomach drop. That poor girl. :(", "One of my best friends in high school had an ED, and she was/is the same way. Someone offering to cook for her was ok, and sometimes helped, because she didn't feel bad/alone/abnormal for being hungry (\"if BabyCow is hungry too, it must be ok that I'm hungry. That's ok. Hungry is ok\") but if I mentioned anything beyond that, it was gonna be a bad time. Even now, I won't tell her if I switch diets to lose weight or eat better (I'm really bad about eating my veggies). I'll just cook whatever and if she's hungry, she eats. If not, that's cool too", "Funnily enough, my partner had the same reaction. The rest of it he was like hmm not great and then I mentioned OPs Gf asking her about her calories and he freaked out. There\u2019s really no excuse not to know how triggering that is", "I know, me too!\n\nHe should\u2019ve asked GF how many calories SHES had today? \nI bet GF would instantly have her hackles raised. Why? Bc it\u2019s inappropriate and invasive and people instantly feel judged. Eating disorder or not. \n\nIt\u2019s also not her business. That\u2019s private between her and her doctors and her guardian (in a situation like this, otherwise I\u2019d say probably not even op business unless it\u2019s incredibly concerning I.e. just like this)\n\nIt\u2019s why people feel that the weight check right at the beginning of a doctor appointment is just the cherry on top of an already uncomfortable situation? \ud83d\ude12\nLike, cool, thx for the scale check. I\u2019m sick and now I\u2019m depressed, can\u2019t wait for the hour long naked waiting period to get this party started! \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah as someone who struggles hard still the calorie question is one of the worst things to ask!", "Thank you! I\u2019ve always loved reading and your thing about reading anything with words made me chuckle. I remember being a kid and reading the back of shampoo bottles just because I wanted to know what it said.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest things from childhood and adulthood messed with my love of reading and I\u2019m still trying to find my way back. ADHD doesn\u2019t help haha. So thank you for reminding me of a silly little fond memory"]}
