Original friends is specially because they sent a list of demands how they wanted to be hosted. And literally treated you like a free babysitter with the bed time routines of their kids.\n\nDunno but if you have a txt message from them about the Airbnb I had keep it and show it to your friends that think you the AH. They said no and someone needed your help so it\u2019s fair. They should have asked if it was still possible to crash at yours instead of just sending a list of demands", "NtA. They did say they will instead book a place near the wedding venue and then changed their mind 4 days before the wedding. You might re consider if they are friends you want to keep. I haven\u2019t heard of guests demanding about the sleeping arrangements unless they are paying. Are they? Guests are usually just thankful for having a place to stay and adjust accordingly .

You were doing them a favor, and they got upset at you for their lack of planning, in no way are you the AH. \n\nHopefully they were just frazzled with the last minute planning and will apologize, particularly for how they responded, especially since you were giving free babysitting and (before plans changed) free lodging, and recognize their poor planning and negative outburst. You\u2019re NTA, but they are, and owe you an apology."]}
