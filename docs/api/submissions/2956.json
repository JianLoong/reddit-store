I have also been the parent holding down my hysterical toddler for a catheter insertion for a kidney/urethra issue, and I did feel terrible about that one but guess what, I did it anyway.

It was horrific and traumatizing. But if it's necessary medicine and not some random ayurvedic drink, then I'd force them.", "As you could read in my post, my point is on not traumatising him which would make it easier when I have to give him medication that he needs. Of course if he needs something I would make him take it. He slept and woke up fine in the morning.", "Piggybacking on top comment. I have a hard time judging this one as a parent of many kids.   \n\n\nAcetaminophen is hard to get in a kid, it tastes horrible. I usually end up giving it by force because they need it. In this case, I would have given ibuprofen. It tastes a lot better, lasts longer, and does a good job. If I only had acetaminophen, I probably would not have forced it in this instance. Pain relief is a good thing, but if it\u2019s the only reason why I\u2019m giving the medicine, it\u2018s not always worth the fight. I will fight them if it\u2019s for reducing very high fevers or infections.  \n\n\nu/RachVF,  please  teach  your  child  to  take  pills.  It\u2019s  so  much  easier.  It  can  be  done  with  pill  sized  candies.  You  can  even  talk  about  how  little  he  actually  got  to  taste  them,  then  point  out  that  medicine  usually  has  coatings  on  it  so  doesn\u2018t  have  taste  at  all.  My  second even  learned  before  his  third  birthday  because  medicine  was  so  difficult  for  him.   Also  there  are  different  flavors  of  chewables  between  the  name  brands  and  store  brands,  you  might  be  able  to  find  something  more  agreeable.", "Whaaaaat? The child painkiller in the UK is delicious, it's mostly sugar syrup and flavouring. Seems like a no brainer for making children take their medicine. \n\n ...... although it does sometimes make children pretend to be sick in order to get the delicious medicine.", "He was asleep before the medication would have kicked in, so I don't think that he suffered any longer than he needed to", "Acetaminophen is purely a fever/pain reducer and not an anti-inflammatory. Ibuprofen is both.   \n\n\nShe tried to give it for comfort reasons, not because he had a dangerously high fever. This is one of those situations I would not fight my child to get meds in, but i would break out a few tricks or bribes before giving up. But if I couldn\u2019t get it in them without force, I would let it go.", "I am a mother of grownups and sometimes you choose for them.", "So you'd rather be miserable than swallow medicine and feel better? \n\nDayquil taste goes away in like a minute, im just curious", "he won\u2019t be in pain anymore??", "By taking away the child\u2019s pain? Wtf are you talking about?", "You can't give a 4 year old a pill.", "He had an ear infection. He needed it!!", "That doesn\u2019t explain why you didn\u2019t even attempt to find a less traumatizing solution before letting him tough it out? Mixing it in food or a drink? That just never crossed your mind?", "But what if he hadn't woken up? Yes, end result this time was positive. Doesn't negate the fact that illnesses are unpredictable.\n\nI have a friend who had an ear infection. Developed into a brain infection. Went septic. Was in a coma for 1.5 months. Yes, still alive, but with mild cognitive issues.", "What\u2019s more traumatic: being in terrible pain fit hours  or three seconds of a bad taste from taking medicine?", "like being in horrible ear pain is less traumatizing? what do you do when he wants ice cream for dinner instead of broccoli?", "There are a ton of people who think people *need* Tylenol when they\u2019re sick! You definitely don\u2019t. It helps with pain and fever, but if he just went to sleep without it, it was fine not to give it.\n\nI think some people think it was antibiotics or something. Obviously we have to force that if kids won\u2019t take it. Tylenol in the middle of the night? There\u2019s more wiggle room.\n\nYou\u2019re fine, OP, NTA. I assume a lot of this has to do with the majority of Americans getting mixed up about antibiotics (mandatory to finish the full course) vs. painkillers (optional, take as needed).", "\u2026 your position makes no sense. Your child is four years old. If he decided to  move to California without you, would you respect his choice as well?", "I see what you\u2019re trying to do. \nYour body your choice, consent etc.\n\nNext time, try : mummy understands that it\u2019s your body and only you get to decide what happens to it, but because you are still little it is mummy\u2019s responsibility to keep you safe and healthy, and I will need to make some decisions for you. This is one of those times, you need to take the medicine, would you like me to hold your hand and get you some juice to wash it down? Or can you take it by itself? \n\n\nNAH, we\u2019re all just doing our best.", "Op, if it\u2019s liquid, try mixing it in a small amount of juice similar in flavor. Fruit punch is usually good for masking all flavors. Flavored soda, if he\u2019s allowed a small amount, works even better. I have an autistic son, and for the longest time, I had to mix his and called it magic potion. Thankfully, he\u2019s old enough for the pills, but that\u2019s what worked for me.", "You were right. Better he suffer and get inadequate sleep. His body doesn\u2019t need to fight off an infection or anything.\n\nEven better, just let the eardrum rupture. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll like that better than some yucky chewables or liquid.\n\n/s", "I think Red Bull smells just like the sickly sweet kid painkiller from back in the day. Calpol maybe? Something pink and a bit gloopy.", "They made it less delicious in a lot of places to stop kids getting through childproof  cap and taking swigs of it for fun (as I did 30 years ago in England with calpol.that was delicious).\n\nkids medicine where I am in Mexico is vile, bitter with overtones of sweetness.", "I\u2019ve always thought it wasn\u2019t supposed to taste great due to kids then wanting to drink a bottle cuz it\u2019s \u201cyummy\u201d - I\u2019m from the US", "I can't tell if you're joking but the whole reason children's medicine tastes bad is so they won't try to do exactly what you mentioned in your last sentence lol", "Paracetamol suppositories are your friend for those kids who won\u2019t take the oral!", "They make chewables, we switch once they hit the weight.

Why i dont know but it does, especially when i drink something. Pills i can take, liquid stuff nah ill deal with the cough. Its a sensory/taste thing for me. But yeah id rather have worse symptoms than that god awful taste and have less severe symptoms.\n\nTo be fair, its not just liquid meds either.

He is too young to UNDERSTAND that it will help him.\n\nMy daughter (just turned 5), doesn\u2019t decide if she NEEDS medicine or not, that\u2019s for myself & other qualified adults to decide. She DOES however, get a say in the flavor when there\u2019s an option. I have had to force medicine down her (& her older brothers), it was upsetting for both of us. I after explained why it had to be done, why she had to take the medicine & would check in later to see how much/if it helped. \n\nIf small kids had their way they\u2019d never take medicine, exist on candy, & frequently jump off things for reasons that I assume relate to challenging the laws of nature (or if they can really break their neck doing said action).\n\nSometimes being the parent sucks and involves being \u201cthe bad guy\u201d for their own benefit", "Omg,my son currently has an ear infection and absolutely refuses to take it. The antibiotic that was prescribed smelt and tasted horrible he spit it all out.I called his pediatrician and they changed the prescription and now I mix this one with juice.\n \nEdit: Lol he\u2019s currently drinking from his juice box now and is oblivious that there\u2019s medicine in there.", "Well, to be faaaiiiiiir, it\u2019s pretty awesome her in California", "Thank you for being sensible. I totally understand the mother's position here. I was the type of kid that responded very badly to being forced to take something when I could barely understand what was going on. Gentle encouragement and honest words worked much better.
