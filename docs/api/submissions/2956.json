I have also been the parent holding down my hysterical toddler for a catheter insertion for a kidney/urethra issue, and I did feel terrible about that one but guess what, I did it anyway.

To help him understand what you're asking him to take and why it's important that he takes it. Give him options that he can choose for himself. He has to take the medicine but let him choose if you give it to him or if he puts it in his mouth himself.

Been there, she could separate the meat from the tiny af pill hidden inside!!! That's dedication.\n\nShe was always too smart and technical for her own good (she figured that she can't come into the bedroom, can be in her own bed tho, so dragged her bed into the room while people were out/asleep and laid down on it - impeccable logic, because ofc she knew that she won't be reprimanded while \"in her castle\") except when it counted.", "I\u2019ll definitely look into it. She has an appointment set up with a specialist because she does have issues with her throat and stuff so I\u2019m always looking for something to help her.", "Yes, they are talking about forcing it into their mouth. That does not mean a suppository would be forced.", "You sound like a great mum. I hope you find something that helps!"]}
