I have, just few weeks ago. It freaking hurts your whole head and even made me feel nauseous.\nYour son is 4, and you as a parent have to sometimes make him do things he does not want to.\nLike to take his medicine, because then he learns that hey, it helps.", "YTA. Child's Tylenol tastes gross of course your kid doesn't want to take it. That's not a good reason to reject medicine and as a parent you should be trying to make your child better. This could get worse and you had the right tools at your disposal to make him feel better.", "I\u2019m not even gonna touch the parenting aspect I just have a question. What benefit do you get from \u201ctoughing it out\u201d? Why force yourself to be miserable for a day? I don\u2019t get it. Are you just anti science/medicine?", "YTA.  Not saying you should have beaten him or forced the pills down his throat, but he doesn't understand the consequences and you are the parent and need to take care of him even when he doesn't understand.  Can you stock baby liquid painkillers?  That might be easier to give him in the future as shame he suffered for nothing.", "YTA. He is 4, Give him liquid medicine.", "NTA but consider crushing a pill with a spoon and putting it into some juice for him to drink or in some applesauce to eat etc. This could make everyone happy", "He\u2019s 4 years old, he isn\u2019t old enough to properly understand or take decisions regarding medicine. I would have given him the medicine.", "Calpol can be disguised in Vimto or similar fruit cordial, we had same problem with our daughter when she was little.\n\nShe survived, she's 33 now, your little one will be fine", "Yta he's a child in pain - you don't have to force him there are easy ways to help him take it. And in he end he's 4 and you are responsible for his health.", "NAH. I get you don't wanna force your kid to take his medicine, but it's there for a reason. As a parent I'm of the philosophy that it doesn't matter what a child wants, especially a four year old who has no idea about wants or needs, but what does the child need. Your husband has a right to be upset with you as it seemed you may have bent to the will of the child when you're the parent in the situation and it should be the other way around. Either way the kid seems to be fine at the end of the day.", "If it's just a painkiller and no antibiotics or anything, then it's fine to let your child choose. NTA\r  \n(I am a mother of 3 year old toddler)", "NTA\n\nBut there are other options than force feeding. You could have been a bit more creative...", "NAH, get some Calpol and make it a nice thing for your son. I understand both sides.", "NAH, your son doesn't want it but is it possible he doesn't know it will relieve his pain? Had a cousin who thought panadol would make him an addict XD.", "YTA - if the painkillers were prescribed by a doctor and had an anti-inflammatory purpose", "nta at all\n\nyou did the right thing\n\none mum to another\n\nput the calpol  in juice they wont tell the difference", "absolutely not. you are NTA. i have a 4 year old son. when he was little he wouldn\u2019t take medicine at all. he hated it. until he got into a car accident and broke his collarbone 10 days before his 3rd birthday. he was in so much pain when we got home and the pain meds had worn off. and after a while of talking and explaining to him that the reason he didn\u2019t hurt before but did then was cause the medicine wore off - literally had to explain it 400 different ways - and i asked him to please just try the medicine, and he was desperate at that point - he tried it. it was bubble gum flavor and it changed everything. he hasn\u2019t really needed medicine since (i only give meds if other stuff doesn\u2019t work. like it\u2019s always a very last resort, so we rarely need them) until the last 10 days. he had folliculitis on the back of his head and he needed 15mL \u20264 times a day. i thought for sure it was gonna be hell for the next 10 days. but thank god the medicine was bubble gum cause he did just fine with it. and i know that\u2019s from not having forced him before. if you traumatize a kid, they\u2019re gonna remember it and never wanna do it when the time comes. and honestly, i\u2019ve found that once they really understand what medicine does, when they get desperate enough they\u2019ll take it. what we do.. we put the medicine in an oral syringe and then get a little bowl of water so that he can pull up water into another syringe and squirt it in his mouth immediately and then i let him get up all the water in the bowl. it worked for us!", "NTA. Your husband isn\u2019t the one in pain your son is, he determined he could tough it out and he did eventually", "Nta. Forcing him when it isnt necessary does make it harder when it IS necessary. Assuming you explained what it was and how it would help, a 4 year can and almost certainly did understand. I dont force tylenol down my kids' throat either. We're down with the flu right now and i offer tylenol, ibuprofen, cough medicine near constantly. Occasionally i can get one of them to take some ibuprofen but im not going to force it. Popsicles is the main treatment here XD\n\nIm a 28 year old woman and I hate taking meds, ESPECIALLY liquid meds. I can get downright combative when my husband tries to talk/guilt me into taking dayquil. Hate the stuff, i do NOT care that it helps relieve the symptoms. Id rather be sicker than taste that stuff. I supposed i should be grateful that im an adult and not a child or it might get forced down my throat.", "Nah. You are worried about your child's psychological wellbeing. Your husband wad worried about him being in physical pain. You are both right and you are both trying to protect your kid. You just value those two priorities differently. You probably need to talk it out when calm.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Simply so I had the pills and could calm down.\n\nForce feeding pills is a bad idea. Hiding the pill in something he likes/something  is the right thing to do. Then he can sleep easier and doesn't have pain.", "NAH in this case you have to think which is worst for you. The battle to get them in or the upset in pain child for the next few hours.\nYou also need to think about the future, what if he needs antibiotics in a few weeks and thinks medication is optional.\nToddler needs to know that sometimes it's a choice and sometimes it isn't and that kicking off won't work.\nOr do the easy thing and bribe and sneak. Everyone wins that way.", "YTA. Medicine for a kid that age should not be negotiable and you shouldn\u2019t be asking him something that he can\u2019t understand and just going along with what he says. Literally put it in juice next time and save everyone the trouble.", "Put it in the syringe and put it into the side of his mouth and then to the back. Tell him it will help and he needs to trust you. Hug, shush and comfort. Kids medicines taste good too. Kids will say no to anything unknown, it protects them. This is a learning moment. You and your hubby are the protectors. He needs to trust you so give the the medicine.", "YTA\n\nYour the parent it\u2019s your responsibility to decide what is best for him, not a 4 year old. Sometime us parents have to do things we know they won\u2019t like but it\u2019s in their best interest, like brushing teeth, going to the doctors/ dentist ect. \nYou find ways to make it work, distraction, rewards, bribery ect whatever works for you.", "NTA.  \nIf your child had a dangerously high fever, then yes, you do what you must, but this isn't dangerous!  \n\n\n(I \\*would\\* recommend getting some ear drops tho!

He went to stay at my mums house and he happily took some child friendly honey and marshmallow root cough syrup that tasted so good from my mum. The moment I poured it out he refused it. \n\nMy husband is similar to yours in the idea of holding him down and forcing him to take it, but imo that is not worth it. For one he\u2019s more likely to spit it out and two it undermines his trust in us.", "NAH it can be upsetting to see them distressed...however it would have helped him with the pain...have you tried the syringe type paracetamols...just squirt it in their months and you're done", "I told him that it would make him feel better and wanted him to take it, but I wasn't going to force him against his choice, which is what my husband wanted to do", "How does that make anything easier?", "4 year olds don\u2019t get pills, they get liquid painkillers.", "My oldest is 4 and for the last 2 years if we force him to take any type of medication he gets so upset that he vomits for the next 4 hours.

Just hide it in food / drink or by a paracetamol children syrop and don't tell him what it is. I mean handeling a small child is tricking them into do stuff they don't like but need all the time.", "Personally I found it easier to get my son to try his painkillers by getting some hard vitamins for me to take and show him it's not that bad", "4-year-olds should not get a choice about whether to take medicine.  Your job as a parent is to do what's best for them, and treating their illness is what's best for them.  YTA", "Exactly. Four is still young enough that you can do the juice switcheroo (cutting out the back of a juice box). \n\nI work in child safety and I used to work for an organization that frequently works with kids with serious health issues. One of the things pediatricians and nurses insist on is making necessary medication a non-negotiable. You can tell them they get a reward for finishing, or you can turn it into an age-appropriate \"choice\" (do you want to have a sip of sweet beverage x or y after you finish your medication?).\n\nI know that no parent wants to consider it, but you may have to one day deal with your child battling a serious illness and you don't want to create unhealthy behaviors or relationships with medication, even if that doesn't happen."]}
