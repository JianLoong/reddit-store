I have also been the parent holding down my hysterical toddler for a catheter insertion for a kidney/urethra issue, and I did feel terrible about that one but guess what, I did it anyway.

Her psychiatrist hasn\u2019t said anything regarding it but I still worry lol.", "See I\u2019m 29 my grandma taught me how when I was like 17z", "See her pills are very tiny. At first she was taking have a pill and now it\u2019s a full pill.\nShe hasn\u2019t complained about the taste or anything. She chews them no issues. My child is just very unique lol", "She strongly dislikes both. The texture will make her gag.", "I hate Augmentin as an adult, so I feel you!!! I had to negotiate with my little brother once to take Tylenol when his fever was over 102F and there was much crying until he realized he was allowed a Pepsi.", "Wow that sounds really terrible!! I do hope you continue to recover and manage your pain - and I totally understand not wanting to be dependent on a potentially addictive pill - that part makes sense to me (vs just popping a Tylenol once a month for a headache). Best of luck to you!!", "We always followed up liquid medicine with like chocolate milk or a squirt of whipped cream to help get the taste out, when she was  little. The bribe also helped get her to take it more willingly.", "Was it the chalky feeling gritty stuff that tastes according to my daughter \"like licking a chalkboard\"?", "Four year olds should suffer with pain because the paracetamol doesn\u2019t cure the ear infection, is it? Are you listening to yourself?", "Yes they numb the pain \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "\u201cEarache\u201d still would have taken the pain away \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My train of thought is:\n- child is in pain\n- pain meds should be given to relieve pain and help with a restful sleep\n- child is not capable of making an informed decision \n\nI do recognize that the source of the pain was localized and the source was not identified; ie physical trauma, infection\n\nYes, the jump between OTC pain meds vs antibiotics is broad, but I believe the principle is the same. \n\nAs for my friend, they had just started a course of antibiotics because the GP diagnosed an ear infection. Had they stuck with pain meds as they had the week prior, they would be very dead. The hours before going into the hospital, they developed a massive headache. This gave my friend and spouse a huge bloody red flag that there was something seriously wrong.", "In many places in Europe the suppository paracetamol is the most common type. Its fast more effective and easier to give. They are pretty small too", "My kids didn\u2019t notice. And certainly aren\u2019t traumatised. But it did help their fever ! Our suppositories are very small . They\u2019d be kicking and screaming with the fever and the stress and certainly didn\u2019t notice me popping them in \ud83d\ude05", "It wasn\u2019t life saving medicine, he just had an ear infection calm down. why are we talking\nabout hypothetical scenarios that aren\u2019t what actually Happened? What\u2019s crazy is if a 4 year old says they aren\u2019t hurting much to want help, you for some odd reason believe they\u2019d just lie about it not want to be better lmfao", "I tried that as a teenager but couldn't keep it down. It put me off fizzy drinks for years.", "Oh I can\u2019t do it at all with carbonated beverages - too difficult to take a big gulp.", "That's what I did when I was pregnant and my gag reflex went up to 11 - had to chew some food and hide the pill in the food to trick my own stupid brain.", "spoonful of yogurt, ice cream, anything it can be hidden in and swallowed honestly.\n\ni have a really easy time taking pills but i had a long term roommate that couldn't even take the little tiny allergy tabs without almost puking at one point, and that just stopped. so i started watching what they did and it was just slipping it into food. \n\nbrilliant.", "That\u2019s actually really cool! I didn\u2019t know that.", "Jam works really well with kids. Put the pill in the middle of the spoon, cover it with jam and say if you can swallow without chewing your old enough for another spoonful.", "Yes this! It took me til about 2 years ago to figure this out!", "I'm a adult who hates pills. I do it the opposite way. Fill my mouth with water, stuff pill in and do a quick swallow \ud83d\ude05", "I think there may be some meds that you\u2019re not supposed to chew. Not sure if it applies to your daughters meds but thought I\u2019d bring it up!", "Chewing can change the absorption time on medications, just be careful if it\u2019s a medication that really isn\u2019t meant to be chewed", "Some kids are just like that. Honestly, all three of my bigs have each challenged me in their own way.", "Applesauce or Jello are good for this, too. They do also make Thickened Water (which sounds dumb, I know) for people who have trouble swallowing. If it's a regular issue it might be worth looking into.", "Try Jam, whatever flavor of fruit she likes only in jam form..", "Poor thing. Poor mom. I saw your other comments after I posted. \n\nHope you guys can find something that works for her consistently.", "Thank you I appreciate it! Yeah it was helpful but definitely scary, it gave a very euphoric high that would scare me because of how easy I could find it addictive if misused. But I\u2019m also annoying optimistic so I know that\u2019s why my pain tolerance is good, after I got ran over my manager ran out asking what happened and my first response was \u201cI may or may not have just been ran over haha\u201d", "He calmed down and slept through the night and was fine in the morning. Clearly it was not severe pain. Young kids, especially in the evening when tired, will melt down over any slight discomfort. Learning to tell the difference between that and an actual problem is one of the big challenges of parenthood. Skipping a pain killer will not harm your child in any way beyond maybe costing them a little sleep. If they can\u2019t sleep or wake up in pain, that\u2019s when I would force it personally. Pain is discomfort, it\u2019s not actively harming you. It\u2019s different if it\u2019s actual medication or if they have a fever and you need them to take Tylenol to bring it down. \n\nMy son is 8 and still doesn\u2019t ever want to take Tylenol for pain because he would rather just deal with it. We had to force medicine on him a few times when he was young, but that was either antibiotics or for fever.", "I used to work in a pharmacy and it's even worse if you don't put the lid on when adding water to reconstitute it... We all wore it at least once when learning, lol. The best cover flavors were banana strawberry (awful but some kids liked it), cherry (covers everything) and grape (same as cherry)! But we had a list of about 10+ flavors to try... For a few dollars we could even flavor otc meds.", "Which is fine in a gentle situation.  Suppositories aren't my first choice but they have their place. Force?  Oh hell no.", "Good for them. In the context of forcing medicine on someone, rectally isn't my first choice.  There are definitely situations where it's advisable, nausea medication, some seizure medications.  Depends on the ages too I guess...\n\nJust rubs me the wrong way, but I was abused at that age so...", "What's crazy is that you think a 4 year old thought about the benefits and drawbacks to the medicine and then made a rational decision not to take medicine because they felt they weren't hurting enough to warrant it. The kid is 4, the thought process didn't go beyond whether the medicine tasted yucky.", "My kid has literally projectile vomited multiple times when I've tried to mix medicine with juice or even yogurt smoothies. I don't know why you're being downvoted. For some it's not just a simple \"force them to do it, you're the parent\".", "Tbf, prenatal vitamins are pretty big.", "I happily didn't have that problem while pregnant, but it really does work great!", "So I guess there ARE things to be learned with how people handle dogs. I mean it's pretty much the no. 1 trick in the book - they won't eat the pill? Hide it in food.", "He! You're absolutely right, but for some reason, I think it's naughty to use ice cream to swallow pills, which honestly is completely ridiculous. \ud83d\ude48", "I take a mouth full of a drink, pop the pill in with that and then swallow.", "Try it next time, it works!", "I do that too. Less chance of having it stick to your tongue.", "I grew up with a pharmacist mom, can swallow up to six pills at a time:)", "The bottle doesn\u2019t say if it\u2019s a chewable or not just to give her one at bedtime.", "She definitely challenges me. She\u2019s also on the spectrum and has ADHD so I\u2019m always trying to find different things that work for her with trying new foods and everything. What worked last week might not work this week. What she didn\u2019t like last night she might like today. It drives me crazy and takes a ton of patience\u2019s something my mom didn\u2019t have with me so this is so new to me lol.", "She doesn\u2019t like either of those \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019ve tried many times.", "My daughter is very unique lol she definitely gives me a run for my money", "Why do you assume they would be forcing it? My kid hates oral painkillers and they often make him vomit but is fine to take the suppository.", "Suppositories are take out the force. Most kids at this age are used to parents wiping for them so dont fight suppositories. They stop being recommended after 5yrs as kids get more resistant to help in toilet hence more resistant to suppositories", "I\u2019m sorry for your trauma. I\u2019m just talking about simple parenting tips.", "LMFAOOO dude what you don\u2019t get it, it doesn\u2019t matter about the benefits and drawbacks, the only necessity for him to take the meds is to stop the pain. He said no, then stopped whining and slept a bit later. Why do you give so much of a shit about forcing him to take it if he literally ended up being fine just like he said, I can tell what kind of controlling parent you must be\u2026", "Because their kids work that way and they only can Imagine it that way. Certain medicines have to get into the kid somehow, I agree. Painmedicine isn't one of them.", "Exactly yes!", "Did you read the OP?", "Yea, I'm the kind of parent that decides when my 4 year old takes medicine instead of letting the 4 year old decide when to take medicine. If that makes me controlling then so be it.", "There are literally people insinuating she got lucky her toddler didn't die in his sleep because she didn't force tylenol down his throat for an earache. Even if he had an ear infection, tylenol is not the cure for that, you need antibiotics.", "Do you also decide when they\u2019re ready for bowel movements?
