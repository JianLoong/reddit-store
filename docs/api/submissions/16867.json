So, let me get it straight, you didn't wear the sundress to a wedding, you wore it to go on a walk, and your cousin flipped? Like, seriously? What spotlight?

You don't wear white to a wedding but the bride doesn't have permanent dibs for an undisclosed amount of time before and after the wedding. A white sundress is not a wedding dress. Hopefully you can get a refund or pocket the money in any gift you were getting.", "NTA\n\nA sundress is very different from a wedding dress.

Some people need to be blocked from your social media account. They are *waaaay* to interested in what you are doing. NTA", "NTA, your cousin is on some other trip. I can see if it's a problem if you wore the dress to the wedding, but to freak out because you had a white dress on doing something that is not even related to the wedding is just Bridezilla really.

And that no one gets to claim a whole color from the entire world for a week before the wedding?", "NTA. You aren\u2019t wearing white to the wedding. The expectation that you can\u2019t casually wear white during the summer/warmer days is delusional.

But seriously cousin has gone full Bridezilla. Never go full Bridezilla people. I'd text the cousin and say are you really getting angry at me for wearing a white sundress a week before your big day? How in the world am I stealing the spotlight a week before the wedding? You are being ridiculous and need to chill. Guess what the world does not revolve around your damn wedding. Do you want me to wear this dress at your wedding? Keep up with the bridezilla attitude and I might. (Of course don't but cousin deserves to sweat being this ridiculous) NTA", "> OP didn't steal the spotlight.\n> \n> OP stole the sunlight!\n\nDid we just witness the birth of a new supervillain?", "Nah, Op should have a nice day with BF on the day of her cousin\u2019s wedding wearing the sundress. Of course, my petty self would consider doing this, post a lot of pictures and tag the unhinged family members. \ud83d\ude01", "She didn't tho, since white reflect the sun \ud83d\ude06", "No one is allowed to wear white all year in the bride\u2019s family because \u2018it\u2019s her wedding year\u2019.

I'm French, but live in the UK. My younger sister, her husband, and our Mum still live in France. Because of world events from the past few years we haven't been able to celebrate birthdays together for a while. On top of that, delivery and mail services have been unreliable and/or on strike a lot. So even if we try and plan ahead, oftentimes presents don't arrive on time. So we started the Birthday Week tradition. Which then turned into a Birthday Month. And now we are at Birthday Trimester, since we just celebrated my Mum's birthday (she was born beginning of April). Mine is in August, so my birthday trimester is starting soon haha\nIt doesn't mean month-long celebration or spotlight or anything though, just that we celebrate when we can and however we can!", "Bot", "My first thought as well.

And definitely make sure she wear white on the anniversary itself. \n\nAnd OP, you're NTA in the least! I bet you looked amazing in your sundress and you should wear it as much as you want!", "It\u2019s so petty, but I would totally do the first one. No mentions of the cousin or the wedding. Just lots and lots of pics across all the usual social media platforms in that dress.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t solve any issues and would surely increase the uproar, but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d care overmuch about people who reacted the way the bride and her supporters did anyway.", "Her bipolar sister had had a really rough period, fallen out with the family a while before the wedding. Then she got on the right meds, good job and met a nice guy. Decided to go public with the relationship a few months before the wedding on social media. She got a lot of comments wishing her well. Let me remind you her sister is bipolar so it isn\u2019t just about the new boyfriend; she\u2019s all ecstatic that she\u2019s stable for once, not hearing things and raging out. She\u2019s so happy she\u2019s mended fences with family members and is going to be in her sisters wedding. And her post was MONTHS before the actual wedding. So\u2026My sister in law completely tore into her..publicly..and accused her of trying to steal the wedding spotlight. Uninvited her from the wedding and some family members that had commented on her page. She hasn\u2019t talked to her still in 6 years. That\u2019s just the start of it. That whole family is beyond narcissistic.", "What was the joke?", "Isn\u2019t that the same thing lmao?", "Jokes are funny.", "I can just imagine the \u201csupervillain\u201c wearing all black to her cousin\u2019s wedding and cackling at the bride when she walks down the aisle lol!", "I will steal all the sun light with my evil creation with my sundress", "Depending on how metaphorical you want to be, Mr Burns already stole the sunlight.", "Dancing in the moonlight \u2728\ufe0f", "Lol that sounds more like \u201cyou have 3 whole months to fulfill your bday related duties and I won\u2019t be mad if it\u2019s late\u201d haha I like it!", "That\u2019s the way!", "I love this birthday trimester!", "It\u2019s my birthday year, so nobody else can have the spotlight", "Hen Do sounds like an oriental martial art, where you derive your power by becoming the centre of the universe.", "No, i meant is only the bride to be allowed to wear white at a hen do now", "Maybe it would have been better phrased as; at the hen do?

With any luck, she\u2019ll never speak to you again. \ud83d\ude1c", "that\u2019s beautiful! \n\nBride is being a bridezilla. You didn\u2019t wear it to a wedding or bridal event, you just wore it on your own time.", "Maybe your cousin is going to wear a similar dress instead of an actual wedding gown or something and thats why she went apeshit? NTA anyway", "It doesn't matter what the dress is. If it was a wedding related activity, then yes you'd be the AH. But it was a date with your boyfriend. You're allowed to wear what ever the heck you want for that!", "Oh that's lovely! And very much not a wedding dress. NTA", "That isn't a sundress but regardless, NTA.", "No way is that a wedding dress.", "Sounds like your cousin and her nutty co-horts have got their knickers in a twist about bugger all.", "That\u2019s very generous of you, but this is a wild overreaction by your cousin.\n\nI would advise against holding a grudge, but I will say that your cousin owes you an apology when/if she wants to have a relationship with you in the future. Her behavior is not how people should treat others, regardless of stress.", "She is very clearly jealous of your looks and thinks you look better in that dress than she does in her wedding dress. Pure projection\n\nEdit: as tpodr pointed out below me, it's also likely that the fiance made a comment which explains the misdirected freakout.", "Did you add any sort of caption to the photos?\n\nETA: not that I think you captioned it eluding to looking best in white, or that you feel like a bride, or took a direct dig at your cousin and just didn\u2019t disclose that - just curious what else might have contributed to such a strange trigger despite her normally being laid back. She could be rather close to a breakdown, struggling with insecurities and lashing out as a response because very few adults know how to manage their stress. If you can narrow down the possible subtext she misread, it might help broach the subject later down the road when tensions aren\u2019t so high (assuming this is a cousin & family you wish to smooth things over with, totally fine if not!)", "Uninviting someone from a wedding over something like this is unforgiveable psycho shit.", "Did you at least mention being a bride or something wedding related in the subtitles of your post?\n\nIf not, what\u2019s up with your family?

Most people probably wouldn't be bothered but better safe than sorry haha", "It still reads fine to me.\n\nCould be a dialect difference maybe? Both ways make sense and while the way the other user wrote it reads more naturally to me, there's a bell of a lot of variation in English.", "Looks like a sundress to me but either way it\u2019s not a wedding dress and the cousin is an AH", "Oh it said it was on the tag it came with?", "Good advice.  I\u2019ve seen long lasting disagreements over less than this.", "This is the correct answer.", "Or worse, the cousin\u2019s fianc\u00e9 saw the photo and made a troubling comment. Hence the jealous fit.", "Do all your jokes crash?", "But that isn't why she was mad. Not every dress is a wedding dress, and OP's dress isn't a wedding dress. She was mad because it was WHITE.\n\nClassic guy things, not understanding the situation.", "And I won't announce it at your wedding", "Odd.  Usually a sundress is short sleeved or strappy.  Regardless, it is just a dress and your cousin is being silly", "The people that put the information on the tag are not always aware of what the tag will be applied to. \n\nI see this way too often on Trilbys mislabeled as Fedoras.", "That makes more sense than just thinking she looks better. It's a wedding dress, nothing outshines the wedding dress even if it's ugly.", "Sundresses aren't all short sleeved! If it's lightweight, long, and made for warm weather it's a sundresss imho!", "Especially since OP said she was warm. Wearing a long sleeved, past the knees dress is definitely not going to make one cooler. Also, depending on the angle the pics were taken,  this \"sundress\" could appear to be to be something more to the viewer. OP is NTA, but was misleading in the description of her outfit.."]}
