So, let me get it straight, you didn't wear the sundress to a wedding, you wore it to go on a walk, and your cousin flipped? Like, seriously? What spotlight? Does she expect other people to stop living their lives while she is preparing to get married?", "NTA. That seems like a extreme overreaction. You don't wear white to a wedding but the bride doesn't have permanent dibs for an undisclosed amount of time before and after the wedding. A white sundress is not a wedding dress. Hopefully you can get a refund or pocket the money in any gift you were getting.", "NTA\n\nA sundress is very different from a wedding dress. Besides, you didn't post the photo on her Snapchat, but on yours. On your social media, you can post photos of yourself with any dress, anytime. It's not that you went to the wedding wearing white, you were hanging out with your bf.\n\nLooks like your cousin is going through a massive bridezilla phase.", "NTA... that cousin and family members have major issues... who cares what u wear and post .. u were enjoying something your bf got u... well at least u can have some relaxation time...\nAvoid that cousin and those family members", "So. You\u2026 posted four photos of yourself \u2026 on your personal social media account\u2026 of yourself wearing a cute white sundress\u2026 four days before a relative gets married\u2026 and now half your family is in an uproar, the upcoming bride cusses you out, and you are uninvited to the wedding.\n\nHoly overreaction, Batman. Some people need to be blocked from your social media account. They are *waaaay* to interested in what you are doing. NTA", "NTA, your cousin is on some other trip. I can see if it's a problem if you wore the dress to the wedding, but to freak out because you had a white dress on doing something that is not even related to the wedding is just Bridezilla really. Is she planning on telling all the wedding guests what they are allowed to wear all week long?", "NTA. Your cousin is insane and irrational. That was no reason to get so upset and cancel your invitation to the wedding. Sounds like she has issues. If you bought her a gift, keep it.", "NTA.

Uhh, they do know white and white dresses do not solely signify and belong to weddings, right?  And that no one gets to claim a whole color from the entire world for a week before the wedding?", "NTA. You aren\u2019t wearing white to the wedding. The expectation that you can\u2019t casually wear white during the summer/warmer days is delusional.

More like the entire month before and after the wedding just to be sure!!! /s", "What\u2019s more concerning is that people are agreeing with her craziness. I didn\u2019t know if my friend gets married in June I should pack up everything that is white for the Entire month.  Definitely Nta.", "You haven\u2019t met my sister in law and her family\u2026", "Disagree, my niece is a major bridezilla and has said some very crazy things/created rules for her wedding that is over a year away still.  Some girls just have a huge princess mentality surrounding ONE day lol", "The best explanation I've gotten is that by post those pics in that dress so close to her wedding, I was either being gery clueless or trying to make a statement to everyone.", "My dress? It's very simple, longsleeve and shin length.", "Wtf?! Someone can't wear a white sundress **FOUR DAYS BEFORE** a wedding?? What planet are you on?", "She has nothing to apologize for, even if it was a wedding dress and she just happened to get married 4 days before her cousin it doesn't matter.  You don't get to corner off weeks for your wedding.", "I mean, my wedding dress IS a normal sundress that doesn't look weddingy except that I got married in it.  I'd certainly never wear it to another wedding cause of the color, but for real.........", "OP didn't steal the spotlight.\n\nOP stole the sunlight!\n\nNTA and i would ask the cousin if she wants to borrow my dress (petty, i know, and i wouldn't really advice OP to do it)", "Lmao oh man. That be great. Then she would of wished she kept her mouth shut for something so dumb.", "I think your cousin did you a favor uninviting you if she is this unhinged but feel free to share any good stories to wedding shaming if she pulls something else.", "You better not wear white in my wedding century. Or else.", "Tell us more.", "Story please.", "That makes absolutely zero fucking sense.\n\nNTA", "Honestly it just seems your cousin is stressed and doesn't know how to handle it, and will latch on to any and all excuses to lash out against people for no reason at all. The thought that you would try to steal the spotlight with a dress at a non-wedding related event is absolutely ridiculous. NTA", "yeah, you just proved my point lol. a sundress can be white & NOT look like a wedding dress. sure, it\u2019s poor taste to wear white to a wedding but OP was simply going about her day\u2026. her cousin wasn\u2019t even around her"]}
