My gf was ghosted by her parents after we left, not being in contact with her for months on end. I blame myself for most of their parents aggression towards her because her parents never really seemed to like me before we moved and now after, it\u2019s been even worse. I\u2019ve always tried my hardest for her parents approval. I\u2019ve persevered blatant disrespect from her parents, cruel jokes, names, and aggression.
