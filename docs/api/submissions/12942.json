Her residency is a 7hr drive from where me, my husband and my baby girl (1.5yr old).\n\nMy brother and I were always very close growing up and even lived in the same apartment and later same city. We were never more than 20-30m away from each other. I got married and had my baby and he moved 7hrs away to be with his fiance, now wife, pretty soon after I had my baby. It was devastating for me as I had always pictured us being close and him really involved as an uncle. SIL works 6am-5:30pm 6-7 days a week but does have some \"golden weekends\" where she has Saturday and Sunday off. She usually has one per month and then she has 3 weeks of vacation (never over Christmas or New Years holidays).\n\nDuring those 1 weekend a month that she has completely off, her and my brother either stay at home because she needs to relax or will drive 2hrs to see her family. During the 3 weeks of vacation, which she is only able to take 1 week at a time, they went on a 1 week long trip to Hawaii, a 1 week long trip to Cancun with her family and then 1 week where they just visited her family 2 hrs away. They haven't made the trip to visit us more than 1-2x a year as they say the drive is too hard with the limited time off she has and she's usually too tired to come anyways. But not too tired for Hawaii or Cancun?\n\nThey always ask my parents and us to visit them during holidays she works so at least we can be together and she will join everyday after 5. But, it's hard for us to travel with a 1.5 year old. My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare. I've been asking my brother and SIL to visit us more even though I know her schedule is busy and my brother got frustrated with me. When I asked him to visit alone, he said she needs him because the heavy workload has been really mentally straining on her and quoted how resident physicians have a really high depression rate and basically called me TA.\n\nI feel its unfair we have to visit all the time considering we have a 1 year old  and also both work FULL TIME and feel they should balance better to visit us rather than just vacation.

YTA", "YTA. \n\nGoing to Hawaii and staying at a hotel is a relaxing vacation. Going to stay with family who has a child is not. Medical residency is gruelling. She can\u2019t \u201cbalance better\u201d. \n\nYou have the right to wish you spent more time with your brother. You do not have the right to expect it though, nor to tell other people how to spend their vacation time.", ">My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare. \n\nYTA\n\nIf you don't want to visit them that's fine. But don't insist they visit you, or begrudge your parents splitting their visits between you and your brother. Your SIL is working 80 hour weeks\u2014that's *double* full time.", "YTA. You don't have to travel to them if it's too hard for you, but you come across as really judgmental and lacking in compassion for how they choose to spend their limited free time. Asking them to travel 7 hours each way for a visit on the rare Sat+Sun she has off is unreasonable - that would be 14 hours of driving for probably not even 24 hours of time together including sleep hours. You say they do make the trip about twice a year, and that seems reasonable given these circumstances.", "YTA for demanding a concession from somebody else (that they use their precious time off to spend with you) when you won\u2019t do the same for them. As much as you love your brother, you sound a lot like you want to be able to make demands on him and that the dynamic is that you expect him to take care of you and that you should be able to call on him whenever *you* choose regardless of whether he\u2019s got the time or energy to do so. That\u2019s pretty exhausting for him and his wife, and it\u2019s not surprising that they want to use their vacation time to actually relax.\n\nYou also don\u2019t get to complain about your parents choosing to spend a small amount of time with your brother rather than looking after your kid. They are his parents too and it\u2019s not for you to judge how your parents do that - if they are unavailable you will just have to find another solution for your child.", "YTA. \n\nFirst off you are not entitled to your adult brothers time and you don't have a say in where they live. If you are so pressed about it you move closer to them...\n\nSecondly, I'm not working 60-80 hours (anymore) in a high stress environment but I can for sure tell you that there is no way on gods green earth that I would be driving 7 hours more than once or twice a year to visit my sibling... I love my brother. But no... \n\nThirdly, You don't NEED THEM FOR CHILDCARE. Your parents are not your built in baby sitters so saying that them going to visit your brother is hard on you... No hun... Your not entitled to your parents either. \n\nFourth, So you don't want to make a 7 hour trip with a 18 month old. Your brother and SIL don't want to make a 7 hour trip because SHE WORKS DOUBLE WHAT A NORMAL PERSON WORKS AND SEES PEOPLE DIE ON A REGULAR BASIS.... So yes if she wants to stay home or go to Hawaii and Cancun that is their right and choice. I have two kids.

Being a resident is ridiculously stressful because you are responsible for medical care for which you are too tired to rightfully be making decisions. Oh, and then there is seeing all the death and suffering. Any opportunity to get away from stress must be seized. Long drives to stay with toddlers whose parents lack compassion for you does not qualify.", "YTA- she works 80hr weeks and you think she wants to drive 14 hrs just to visit you for basically a day! wow.  2 hours to seek her family is not that far, 7 hours is alot to drive for most people with a normal job.  FYI, sorry but you are no longer the focus for your brother, he has his own life now.

I'm guessing you and her aren't very close, so to her visiting you would not be considered fun and relaxing, but rather a stressful chore she is forced to endure on one of the VERY RARE days she has off. Your entitled attitude about her and her husbands time is probably not helping things either, being 'devastated' that your brother is not super involved as an uncle is not the healthiest response, he's not a second parent to the kid and having the expectation that he wouldn't have his own wants and desires in life that would contradict your own could definitely be seen as selfish from an outside perspective (i.e. to his wife who is trying to build her own life with him, and doesn't want a demanding in-law butting in every chance they get.) I understand wanting your brother to be involved as an uncle, so if that's the case why not just ask him to visit more frequently alone if his wife can't make the trip? What about planning day trips where you guys meet somewhere in the middle? just because they don't have a kid doesn't mean making the trip is any more viable for them then it is for you, and expecting them to be able to make time for you're family in their busy lives while not trying to reach any sort of compromise with them isn't ever going to work out well.", "YTA. Quit telling your brother and SIL how to spend their time. Your last paragraph is laughable. You have a kid and work full time? OH NOOOO. You feel they should balance better and see you versus vacations?\n\nKeep it up and you'll guarantee you have no relationship with your brother.", "YTA lmaooooo she\u2019s a resident. don\u2019t take her lack of free time personally", "You entitled ass! They live 7 hours away. She works 60-80 hours a WEEK? Visit them! \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt's common that people distance themselves from their family of origin after marriage.  It's not personal, it just happends.

So it has me shocked that you don't understand why they cannot visit you more. The world does not revolve around you and your kid.\n\nIf you need their presence in your life so much and are unable to make frequent visits due to the time required to drive, you should move to live closer to them. You can't change their work schedule or demand they travel. But you can change your schedule and move yourself.", "Wow, you just really like having the entire world revolve around you, don't you. Having a child doesn't automatically mean everyone has to cater to you. \n\nYTA. Your brother moved away and got married. He has a busy life with his wife. It doesn't include you, you're going to have to adjust and deal with it. You can ask for visits but that's about it.\n\nAnd btw, small children travel extremely well if you take the time to work with them and get them used to it - but that is your choice and whatever you decide about that should be respected.  Just don't expect everyone to bend around your life because that is hella unreasonable.", "YTA Their reasons for not coming more often are just as valid as yours are. Why aren't you visiting \\*them\\* more?? And yeah, having that schedule, I would want a one week trip to Hawaii and Cancun to relax too!", "YTA. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of priorities going on with your brother and SIL. Her own health is their #1 priority and after working 80hrs a week I too wouldn\u2019t want to sit in a car and drive 8hrs to visit you for a handful of hours and then drive back another 8hrs and have enough time to rest before working another 80hr week. \n\nTraveling with a 1.5yr old *IS* hard. However if seeing your brother and SIL is a bigger priority to you, then YOU need to make more of an effort. \n\nSounds like you\u2019re more interested in seeing your brother than her anyways. You should look into weekly video calls.", "Residency is brutal. Not only do they have such long hours but such a stressful job. Sometimes having to work 24 hour shifts. \n\nIt's interesting that you say you shouldn't have to visit them because you work full time but yet you don't seem to have much empathy for their situation. \n\nYTA.", "YTA- 14 he round trip on a rare 2 day weekend- that\u2019s nuts.", "YTA.\n\nShe has no obligation to visit you, and has extremely stressful work.\n\nI would not want to visit someone who is policing what I do with my free time either.", "YTA \n\nYou are fully aware of her schedule, it\u2019s not surprising she doesn\u2019t have the energy to do a 14 hour round trip to come and visit.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to make do with them being able to visit when they can and stop pressuring them.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA.

But that's the life he chose and we try to see each other when we can. And we are grownups about it. I sure as hell don't complain about going to visit him when I can.

And you're mad your brother puts her mental health first like a good husband should?", "It's barely been two years since he moved and you had the baby. Things change when you grow older and you have to roll with it. It seems you are still getting visits in, just not on your schedule. I'm sorry, but in this case her career trumps your baby. YTA.", "YTA. A residency is grueling both mentally and physically. Your brother is incredible for supporting her. If it is so important to see him you need to suck it up and travel to see them. You can travel with an infant. Or you can shut up and wait until residency is over or your baby is older.", "YTA.  She\u2019s a resident and this is her life right now. \n\nResidency doesn\u2019t last forever. It just feels like it. \n\nTry to be supportive of your SIL.

If he wants to visit he will visit, your neediness is pushing him further away.", "YTA. hard and fast.", "Yta you don't get to insist *anyone* visit you more often.  Your brother is not psychically attached to her. If he wanted to visit you more often, *he would*.", "Yes, YTA.", "YTA for insisting. It\u2019s tough realizing that the image you had in your head for your adult relationships with your family don\u2019t always match up to reality, but unfortunately that\u2019s just part of life. Demanding that people come visit you and getting angry that they don\u2019t do it as often as you like will only result in less visits. Be grateful for the time you do get to spend with him and try to connect in other ways (FaceTime, texting, etc).", "YTA.  He has the right (obligation) to prioritize his and his wife's needs/desires over yours.", "YTA. \n\nThey are doing their best and they may actually holiday as a couple and sometimes a flight can be faster than 7h drive. \n\nI travel regularly with my kid younger than yours. It is not easy but doable.", "YTA for trying to dictate how somebody spends their life and time. I'm glad you were close with your brother before, but people change and grow and move away.

You aren't entitled to his life now.", ">But not too tired for Hawaii or Cancun?\n\nThat's vacation... meant to rest. That's the opposite of making her more tired.\n\n>My parents have to split time visiting there and visiting us and we need them for childcare.\n\nYour parents cannot visit their own son because YOU need them for childcare?\n\nYou sound really entitled.

But your brother sounds like a great husband who is doing all he can to support his very stressed wife. And, honestly, her visiting her family is both logistically easier and probably less stressful than visiting her in-laws. Residency doesn't last forever and your child will be easier to travel with in a few years. You can still maintain a closeness with your brother remotely. This will pass.", "YTA!!! Take a flight! Yeesh", "YTA. It's hard for her travel because she's busy with work and it's hard for you to travel with a toddler. That sucks, but it's just where your lives are right now. Maybe when she's done with residency and your kid is older it will be easier for you all to see each other. For now just try to be understanding, call/FaceTime a lot, and make the most of the time you're able to spend together.", "YTA.  You may both work FULL TIME but she works MORE THAN FULL TIME\u2026sometimes 2x as much as full time. Your brother does not have to cater to you just because you have a one year old.  If I worked 60-80 hours, the last thing I\u2019d want to do is drive 7 hours to spend not even 2 full days visiting, then 7 hours back before going to work at 5:30 the next day.  The reality is that visiting your family is just not a priority for them at this stage, nor should it have to be.  If they\u2019re willing, is there somewhere you could meet in the middle maybe once or twice a year? She\u2019s mentally exhausted, Hawaii or Cancun can be a rejuvenating vacation. I highly doubt visiting her husband\u2019s needy sister and their baby would be.", "YTA. Obviously. Having a child doesn\u2019t entitle you to anyone\u2019s free time, especially when that person literally works as much as you and your husband combined in one of the most stressful fields there is. Get over yourself and stop expecting people to cater to you just because you chose to have a kid. I doubt your attitude isn\u2019t part of why she doesn\u2019t want to waste her limited free time with you.", "YTA, a HUGE one too. \n\nResidency is incredibly mentally, emotionally, and physically tolling. The sheer intensity of the program would leave anyone exhausted and unable to travel 14 hours round trip to spend maybe a day (if that) with family.\n\nYou say you work full time (aka 40 hours/week). Well, your SIL is working literally double that NOT INCLUDING presentations and educational work given on the side. It is exhausting. After working like a dog day and night, you think asking her to make a 14 hour round trip on her single free weekend per month is appropriate? And you think asking her only nearby support person to leave her alone as she\u2019s struggling through the trenches of residency is appropriate? Neither of them WANT this to be their reality, but it is. And it will be this way until her residency is complete, whether you like it or not. \n\nYou say you want to see your brother more but claim it\u2019s unfair for you to make the trip constantly. Absolutely not. How about you get a second full time job that includes overnight shifts, being on call, getting absolutely shit on by entitled patients/family members all while getting paid a stipend that, when worked out, is less than minimum wage? Then you can claim it\u2019s unfair for you to make the drive. Until then, it is more than fair for you and your family to visit them. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re saying they don\u2019t want to see you - they just can\u2019t be the ones to do the traveling. That is VERY fair. \n\nAlso, if I was a resident physician, I sure as HELL would be using my vacation time to go on actual vacations. Shaming them for that is gross and manipulative. You will never truly understand what life is like for your SIL, as a resident, and your brother, as a resident\u2019s spouse, but the least you can do is be supportive. I hope this comment has been a wake up call for you and encourages you to rethink the situation.", "YTA\n\nYou and!!! your brother built your own family.\n\nIt's nice to be close but your childhood closeness is gone.\n You are adults and have new streets in your life.\n\nDemanding for more visits because you \"need\" it sooo terrible will divide you.\nKeep an eye on your family and start to accept that others have rights and duties too, but not for you - for themselfs!!!!", "YTA\n\nWho is saying that you HAVE to visit, because that person has AH tendencies too.", "YTA. You are jealous that your brother and SIL have spent time with her family in their  city but not with you in your city.  Her family in only 2 hours away. That is a visit that can be done in 1 or 2 days. You live 7 hours away. They  would spend a majority of the 2  day on travel, plus packing and unpacking for the trip. If you want to see them so bad, go visit them. If it is too much of a burden for your family, then it is too much of a burden for his family.", "YTA. \nYour reasons are reasons but their reasons sound like excuses to you?! It's not like they're free and unnecessarily ignoring you... Huge difference between visiting someone that lives 7 hours away and taking a vacation with the hard earned money they worked for. You work full time and so does she.. You can't take time out to see your brother so do they..", "I\u2019m kind of weirded out about how insistent you are to see your brother often. I kind of get it because I love my siblings as well and I\u2019d love to see them often. But we\u2019re all adults and life gets in the way. Seeing them 4 times a year sounds like a dream to me. That\u2019s really not enough for you? Also, them choosing to see her family more just makes more sense. They live 2 hours away. If they visit you, that\u2019s 14 hours round trip. Do you not see how ridiculous that is for their limited time off? \n\nI also wonder why you feel entitled to their free time. If they would rather spend their time off in Hawaii, that\u2019s up to them? Them driving 7 hours to you would hardly be a vacation. Give them a break man.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nSorry but that's a really hard schedule. Your brother can go on his own if he really wants. Limited vacation and seeing her own family is not crazy esp when your daugher is too young to interact.", "YTA- your brother is not obligated to visit you often, especially right now during his wife's residency. They are probably both exhausted and need their vacations and time to relax. It's definitely NOT rejuvenating to come hang with family, particularly family with a toddler. If you are so pressed to see your brother go see him.", "YTA! You said yourself that she works 60-80 hour weeks. How can you not understand why they don\u2019t want to take seven-hour trips to visit you in the rare downtime they get to spend together? They visit her family more because they are far closer, and she wants a real vacation when she has a week off. You and your husband could move closer if you miss your brother, or just get used to visiting them more. Your kid can sleep in the car on the drive.", "YTA\n\nIf you keep this up they might cut contact with you and they would be right to do so. \n\nAlso going on a vacation is not the same as basically sacrificing a quarter of your already very limited time off to just make a drive and then not being able to unwind from all the stress because you have no time to yourself.", "YTA. everyone else has explained why.", "YTA, hate to break it to you, but you and your toddler aren\u2019t nearly as relaxing as a week in Cancun or Hawaii. \n\nIf you\u2019re already this dismissive of their reasons to not wanna make the trip to yours quite as often, I suspect that you\u2019re not gonna let them actually relax much when they do visit.", "YTA. You feel that you were close to your brother and don't want that to change. That's delusional! The reality of your lives has changed, and you can't go back to how it was when you were in a nuclear family together and living under the same roof. You have both created new nuclear families, and you are now extended family to each other. It's perfectly reasonable to see extended family 1-2 times a year when you are this far away from each other. Have you considered the idea that your brother doesn't really want to visit you more often instead of blaming his wife? If he's so flexible, why doesn't he visit you by himself? My husband and I have 3 preschoolers (had 3 kids in 2 years), and each traveled alone every year and have taken them cross country every year. You have 1 kid! If you continue to act so entitled to their precious vacation time, you are only going to push them away more. You have a vision of how this relationship will be and seem determined to browbeat everyone into making that happen for you, but that's not how healthy relationships work, OP!", "YTA. Driving with a 1.5 year old for 7 hours, with 2 parents, is not that difficult. But by all means, make demands on your brother and his wife...wow. You sound very selfish and self-centered. Your issue with your parents is that you want the constant daycare. Ugh, people like you annoy me to no end. Grow up.", "YTA. There\u2019s a more positive and reasonable way to handle this. Tell your brother you miss hanging out and would like to spend time with him. You can always open a Zoom or Teams meeting and have a brew while you chat. Tell them you\u2019d be thrilled to have them visit when they can. Have your daughter say hi to her uncle on Zoom.", "YTA why does you having a child supersede your SIL working essentially 2 full time jobs? At no point did you mention what efforts you\u2019ve made to make yourself available to their vacations, either, but instead acted as if they should prioritize you on the rare times SIL can actually decompress.", "\u201cThey haven\u2019t made the trip to visit us more than 1-2x a year\u201d\n\nThis seems like a lot given the incredible restrictions on their time. And yes, a planned week-long couple\u2019s holiday is different to a 14-hour round trip for a \u2018visit\u2019 and can\u2019t be compared.\n\n\u201cThey always ask my parents and us to visit them \u2026 but it\u2019s hard for us to travel \u2026 and we need them for childcare.\u201d\n\nSo you expect them to travel while refusing to do so yourself, and your expectations of your parents to provide you with childcare means they\u2019re restricted from visiting too.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to want to see more of your brother. It is not okay to expect him to be the one to make the sacrifices to make it happen, and to pressure him about it.\n\nYTA", "This might be a harsh lesson, but...\nThere is no point in demanding something from someone, that they are not willing to give. You want them to do something. They'd rather not. The end. \n\nYTA.", "YTA - you having a toddler is tough. But so is her job. Right now, her job and her mental health are her babies and she\u2019s choosing to nurture them how she sees fit.

It's inappropriate for you to decide they shouldn't do that. \n\nYou're taking this way too personally because you had this fantasy of what adult life would be like with your brother. It's understandable, but when our siblings get married, we have to understand that their goals and priorities are focused towards their marriage.

Spending your limited holiday lying on a beach doing nothing sounds pretty damn relaxing to me.\n\n>I feel its unfair we have to visit all the time considering we have a 1 year old and also both work FULL TIME and feel they should balance better to visit us rather than just vacation.\n\nShe works more than FULL TIME, she barely has ANY free time.

The one year old will not remember how much they see their uncle at this point and by the time they will remember, I imagine travel should be a lot easier for you. Or you can just accept that your perceived future didn't go the way you planned and visit less.\n\nYTA respect a clear no", "YTA. What kind of work do you do?

Your brother, with whom you were very close, met someone who he KNEW would work long hours, likely move for her job, and be in need of support.

You pictured a future in which he was always around catering to your needs, but he gets to make his own choices. Be grateful he tries to visit when he can.

His wife will always have that spot. It will be nice if you two can see each other sometimes at the holidays or at other times, but it also may be that you are so busy with your own children and careers that you may not see each other in person for a year or more.

I just matched FM (which I am honestly insanely happy about) and I'm already dreading 3 years of 80 hour weeks on paper (open ICU + unopposed program means its likely I'll get a decent chunk of unscheduled 'off hours' in the hospital). Everything I've ever experienced about surgery makes me think 6 years would literally kill me. We need advanced surgeons, and I'm grateful people like you exist, but I can't really wrap my head around that level of fortitude.", "When my husband was a resident, I used to visit him to watch him sleep. Luckily that was years ago. There is no way I would expect anyone to do something like OP. My parents live a plane flight away and I still only see them 2x a year. YTA OP.", "I had the same experience; surgery internship and radiology residency and fellowship, now retired. Also before the work hour restrictions. OP is self-centered, entitled, and just all around horrible about this. OP YTA", "If she wanted to be close to her brother, they could phone, text, asynchronous tv watch, game together, FaceTime\u2014-but it comes off that unless he\u2019s in the same room, that\u2019s not enough attention for her.", "It's all about her *wants*", "I wonder who helped her deliver her baby? Maybe someone who went through a residency?  Lucky for her they were able to put in the time and prioritize their rest so they could become successful doctors.", "There\u2019s a reason why I kept well away from my parents after I finished residency. 1-2x a year was all I could tolerate being around my mother.", "I\u2019m just imagining SIL casually googling vacancies in New Zealand. Lol", "But if OP leaves she won't be able to get her parents to babysit for free.", "But art can be medicine for the heart & soul!  We need that too,", "Not only that, but she seems annoyed that her brother moved and now can't also provide free childcare. It reeks of entitlement.", "She had her baby, and then shortly after he moved 7 hours away. I'm not saying that one caused the other, but brother may not have been on board to be super involved being childcare", "Yup. Someone called it Double Full Time and I love that new term.", "As someone starting residency in june, this makes me sad. Never average out the hourly pay, its depressing..\n\nPlus we're exempt from anti-trust laws, so we can't even do anything about it. Yay government!", "\"we need them for childcare\"... GTFO with that shit...", "That's my favorite line of the entire whine-fest. OP you are such an AH.", "This!! Imagine begrudging your parents spending time with their son and daughter in law because it means you\u2019re deprived of your free babysitter?!?", "That and the \"not too tired for cancun or Hawa\u00ef?\"\nI mean, who is too tired for Hawa\u00ef ?", "The grandparents babysitting really nailed it for me", "I too have a TV degree in criminology as well as crime scene investigation skills. I will help you clean up the evidence and never get caught.\n\nYta op, so. So bad.", "YTA\n\nI was not a nurse, but a resident aide for people with traumatic brain injuries for 18 years. \n\nAs anyone in health care knows, hospitals, nursing homes, (some) med centers, adult foster care homes, etc, are open 24/7. They don't close for weekends or holidays.  \n\nWhich means if you work in health care you are LUCKY if you work somewhere where you have even every other weekend off. I was lucky enough to have every other weekend off. A lot of health care workers only get a weekend off a month or less sometimes. \n\nMy family was kind enough to plan holiday parties around the holidays I had to work and make sure it was on a weekend I was already off. \n\nOP is being straight up RIDICULOUS and SELFISH in regards to how someone else wants to spend the very small amount of free time they have. \n\nAlso, traveling with a toddler isn't that damn hard. Most babies sleep a lot in the car anyway. She needs to quit BEING a baby, and pack her baby up and drive the 14 hour round trip if she wants to see her brother that bad. \n\nAlso, it probably wouldn't hurt for her brother to have a serious talk with OP about who the main woman in his life is. OP may be surprised to find out that it is not her.", "Congratulations on matching!!", "This post is just: Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!", "Honestly they need to fix the system. Not a doctor but I live with chronic illness so I have had my fair share of hospital stays, the last thing I want is a doctor who\u2019s been working 22 hours straight. No one can think clearly doing this, and the guy who came up with the whole idea was a speed junkie. So unless the hospitals want to hand out amphetamines like candy to their residents they should stop this shit.", "Wait \u2018til SIL is done with her residency and then moves 7 *more* hours away to set up her practice. Surprise, OP!", "Hmm, maybe that residency being 7 hours away from OP wasn\u2019t an accident?", "This is EXACTLY what went through my mind. \"Waahhhh my brother used to be close and I soooo wanted him to be on-call for childcare! But his nasty smart doctor wife takes him away for trips to Hawaii and Cancun! How dare they! **I** want a trip to Hawaii or Cancun!\"", "I got both of y'all's backs. Bring it!\n\nExperience: uh. Naked and Afraid. I can keep us alive when we flee and have to hide out in the woods", "Why do I feel like the brother wasn\u2019t forced to move 7 hours away but happily moved 7 hours away.", "He probably will be an involved uncle! Someday, when his wife isn\u2019t in residency working 60-80 hours. Residencies *end* and OP\u2019s baby is literally only a year and half old, not even in memory-retaining space yet. Once SIL and bro have more time, they will also potentially have kids of their own and want to spend family time with the cousins. \n\nIf OP could just get over themselves and their *dream* to wait a bit, all that they want will likely happen.", "Hahahaha", "Agreed. And presumably the brother does *something* with his time... whether working or school or whatever. So realistically brother and SIL probably work/study more hours than OP and her husband.\n\nETA: OP commented that her brother makes \"attending physician money\" implying he in fact is an attending physician. So almost certainly working AT LEAST full-time hours too.", "\"Involved\" is always code for childcare.", "Duct tape is the most useful item anyone brings on that show."]}
