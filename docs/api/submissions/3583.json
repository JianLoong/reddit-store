{"id": 3583, "submission_id": "z8pdun", "title": "AITA for agreeing to host Christmas when asked instead of my SIL?", "selftext": "My (29F) family consists of me, my mum, stepdad, and his four sons (everyone has partners). This story concerns the oldest son, George (32M), and his partner Francesca (30F).\n\nIn our family, I host most of the family gatherings, because my house is big enough to accommodate everyone staying over. Now, I don't particularly enjoy hosting. The cost is astronomical, it takes a long time to plan, and it's quite stressful. However, I have no problem doing it, and I know that everyone enjoys it, and I certainly prefer being at home. There are upsides, but my point is, hosting is not something I jump at the chance to do.\n\nThis year, however, Francesca asked if they could host Christmas. Nobody was keen on this, as their house is very small, no one would be able to stay over so a good chunk of the day would be spent driving (so there would be no drinking for some), the kitchen is tiny so cooking for so many people wouldn't be simple, and they don't have a table large enough to accommodate us all. Despite all this, on the spot no one could think of a polite way to say no, so we all sort of went along with it.\n\nA few days ago, Francesca sent round a group text asking if everyone would be alright bringing something to Christmas, a food dish of some sort, as their oven wasn't large enough to cook everything from scratch and if we all brought something to warm up, that would be easier. Later on in our family group chat (parents and siblings only) my other step-siblings said it would have been better if I hosted Christmas. Even George agreed and said Francesca was totally stressed out about the planning. At this point, my mum suggested maybe I should take it over, since that would take the stress off everyone and save them all a drive. Everyone jumped on the idea and practically begged me to do it. George said he'd talk to Francesca about it since everyone else was in agreement, and I said okay.\n\nI heard nothing more about it until last night, when Francesca sent me a long message, and she was furious. She said I should have refused hosting when asked, because I knew how important it was to her (which I didn't). She accused me of ruining her chance to finally be part of the family, and of lobbying to host Christmas so that I could embarrass her, which is not true. I tried to explain to her that I was just trying to make everything easier for everyone, and that I didn't offer, I was asked, but it was a bit vague because I was trying not to throw everyone else under the bus. Eventually she just stopped replying. I really thought I was at least saving Francesca and everyone else a bit of stress, but a couple of my friends say I should have let her sink or swim on her own, since she was so adamant about hosting. So, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing a lot of comments about the actual dinner, re hosting and cost, so just thought I'd clarify. I've only started hosting the last few years. My mum and stepdad hosted and paid for every family gathering for over a decade, and had I said no to doing it this year, they would be. The cost of hosting Christmas is large, yes, but it's not an insurmountable financial burden, and I'm not being taken advantage of by hosting, my parents have done it in the past, extended family has abroad as well, it's not an unequal thing. \n\nRegarding Francesca co-hosting at my home, this was not something I'd ever encountered until today. We normally have events catered or partially catered, but a number of you suggested Francesca could come and cook at my home, as that would allow her some 'hosting', and that's certainly something I will consider discussing with her and George.

I honestly feel she\u2019s probably more upset that she didn\u2019t think she through when making the offer to host. This really isn\u2019t on you, but everyone needs to speak up if there\u2019s a situation like this again.

I'd have said N A H if the family hadn't discussed this behind Francesca's back and then scuppered her plans. You should have checked in with her. No wonder she's hurt.", "ESH.  Was it realistic for Francesca to offer to host?  Maybe not.  But she did, which you should have been grateful for, because you don\u2019t *like* hosting.  Instead, you let the rest of the family pressure you into doing it the way *they\u2019re* most comfortable with.  If it\u2019s not too late to take that back and tell them to suck it up and try something different this year, I would.  But at the very least, there needs to be a *big* discussion before the holiday season rolls around next year about some of *them* jumping in to take this on if they don\u2019t like how Francesca does it, because it should not just fall to you simply because that\u2019s how *they* want it.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t even like hosting.

Should\u2019ve allowed her to host that way she could see how hard it is.", "NTA but you should've talked directly to her. The husband is TA tho, he didn't even clear with her if it was okay.", "NTA your family needs to step up especially her husband. I think he may have told her a different story about what happened in the chat. You need to speak to her in person not on a chat or phone. Perhaps you 2 can come to a compromise. Maybe co host at your house and help take all the stress off one of you. The pot luck still sounds good they can bring side dishes and you two could do main together. The rest of family should contribute food and the drinks. No reason one person should be wholly responsible for it.", "I think ESH except Francesca. Obviously her house isn't ideal for regular hosting but she wanted to do it once. She's joining the family and probably wanted to do something nice for everyone. Y'all's reasons suck. So some people have to be designated drivers? People don't want to bring one dish (in my experience people contribute to holiday meals even when the host DOES have plenty of kitchen space)? The thought of being at two different tables is unfathomable? And conspiring behind her back to change the plan sucks. George should have stood up for his wife and made it clear that everyone knows your house is better but it's important to Francesca to make this gesture for the family.", "NTA.  It's clear that your family would be much more comfortable at your house.", "ESH.

She sucks for lashing out at you, but I can understand her pain.", "NTA - Francesca bit off more than she could chew and your family, obviously preferring to avoid a disaster they could see coming, tried to dodge the bullet.  I think your mistake was in not making it clear from the outset that this request for change of venue was totally other folks' idea.  I would suggest asking your mother to step up, admit to F that this was her idea, not yours.  Or perhaps her husband could bit the bullet and cope with his wife, since he's clearly as aware as everyone else that this wasn't a good idea.", "NTA you literally did nothing wrong. I don\u2019t know what \u201ctalk\u201d George had with her but it seems to have painted you in a bad light.

This might be a blessing if it gets you some hosting help!", "I'm going to go against the grain and say ESH\n\nYour family for subversively undermining her before she's even had a chance to host, and then balking at her asking to bring stuff - there's what at least 10 people in this group, so why can't each person make a dish? Also if they aren't happy changing traditions why be so weak as to not voice concerns and suggest alternatives? \n\nGeorge for being a spineless fool who is a.

Has clearly not even spoken to his wife about this issue which he should do BEFORE UNDERMINING HER IN A GROUP CHAT without her knowledge\n \nAnd you, because really you say you don't enjoy hosting that much but the vibe I got is that you *knew* you were the 'better host' and that your house was the better option. You could have offered to help her, made it a team effort, and generally been on her side as your SIL, but you didn't, and that has to sting from her. She is right, she must feel terribly that she's not included or not seen as enough.\n\nFrancesca reacted poorly, but she is also trying to make an effort. \n\nChristmas is a time for family - it doesn't matter where it is, but the quality of the people you are surrounded with, and tbh I probably wouldn't want to spend holidays with a group of snakes who undermine me without my knowledge.\n\nETA: if you can't communicate with people you don't bitch about them behind their back. Particularly not family.", "ESH - except Francesca.  You know it and I know it\u2026The odds are, she wasn\u2019t as overwhelmed as her husband claims.  \n\nYour family immediately stated pushing back at the offer because THEY WANT A HANDS FREE VACATION WHERE THEY CAN EAT AND DRINK ON SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S DIME AND TIME!\n\nOh no! They have to actually spend some money and/or time and bring a dish to share with the rest of the family instead of making YOU cover them.  \n\nOh no! They have to figure out a Designated Driver or get an Uber OR CUT BACK ON THEIR DRINKING  to be able to spend time and enjoy the family.  What a bunch of selfish assholes. \n\nAnd here YOU come, martyr extraordinaire to save the day!  Save the day!   What a great example your going to set for your kids!

Not only did you take it back, you refused to return it to the person that wanted the task. \n\nThe family enjoys not having to do anything but show up, drink and lounge.

The rest of the family I have my doubts about, though. Since Francesca so much wanted to host, it wouldn't have killed them to do as she asked. A new set of traditions could have been started, and that is not a bad thing. A major load would have been lifted off your shoulders, not a bad thing either. Finally, and most importantly, as I read it, they had already agreed to Francesca's hosting, so it is a rotten thing to go back on their word, just because it would be a little bit more inconvenient than they are used to.", "Yeah, I changed the names for anonymity and then forgot halfway through haha. I've edited it now", "Whilst I agree that the family acted cowardly and the step brother should have been open with his wife, I don't think it's fair to say their reasons suck. Their Christmas tradition is that they all stay together and eat together as a family and, yes, that does include drinking for them. Expecting people to change all of their traditions for an opportunity to host isn't a nice gesture to the family, it's asking for a day in the spotlight. \n\nA nice gesture would have been to offer to come earlier and help OP prepare the meal and alleviate the pressure on her whilst being able to say \"everyone, I made the turkey/this dish!\" Instead she's asked for everyone to come to her house - despite her husband who also lives there clearly not being keen on the idea - and plan in extra logistics for driving/dish preparing etc etc. \n\nFrancesca is the biggest AH here, she wanted her chance to host despite what inconveniences it meant for everyone else. Everyone else kinda sucks for not being open and honest. OP probably sucks the least because I think she was just trying to go down the path of least resistance.", "Yeah, we probably should have been honest from the get-go. It was just one of those situations where in the moment we were all expecting someone else to say something, and no one did. And then we sort of forgot about it, until her text when it seemed like she wouldn't be able to cope.

The reason I normally do events is because I get them catered, so nobody has to cook. It's not like I'm slaving away in the kitchen alone.\n\nAnd second, they don't need a DD to come to my house, and can still enjoy spending time with family, that's why it's easier.\n\nAlso, we're atheists, Christmas is just about a nice day.", "I said yes because I wanted myself and everyone else to enjoy Christmas.

If I\u2019m Francesca, I don\u2019t give a shit why everyone - my own husband included - thought I was such a terrible pick for host that they went behind my back and forced the job on someone who doesn\u2019t even want it (or claims not to, anyway).  All I care is that they *did*.", "Yes, family traditions matter. They bond people together,create shared memories, and relieve stress for a lot of people who like to know what to expect. I'm not saying traditions can't change, they absolutely can - and should. I'm saying that bulldozing your way in and expecting everything to be done differently and dropping the news less than 4 weeks before Christmas that there was going to be more legwork involved isn't the way to do it. \n\nI think OP's family are a bit much, expecting to be able to just rock up at OP's house and not lift a finger and have their Christmas catered for them in comfort, but that is what they're used to. Christmas is a busy, stressful time of year and now instead of just looking forward to their break they have to figure out who's going to be DD, who's going to prepare what, and how best to transport it. Yes, for many families that's par for the course, but for them it isn't and it's an extra layer of mental resources - including for OP - that they weren't expecting to have to spend on Christmas. \n\nSIL could have done a multitude of things to make changes, including suggesting the potluck at OPs house and asking to bring X dish, or at the very least being upfront when she requested to host and explaining it would mean a fuddle-style Christmas meal. The family should have all 100% been open about not being keen on the idea in the first place, but she let them all agree to come and then dropped the potluck on them *after* they'd already agreed to come.", "Maybe in the US but I have never been to a family celebration in the UK where dinner was potluck (and use of Mum says this is likely not the US). People will bring dessert/ drinks but not the main ime. I would find it very inconvenient personally to bring a dish to xmas dinner if that wasn't agreed from the start and it was the main family celebration. Which is probably the point here - it indicates Francesca bit off more than she could chew and potentially isn't ready for hosting such an important celebration. I don't think she is an asshole though, I just would be honest with her.", "If the family tradition of going to OP's house and drinking and all sitting at one table is THAT important to them, they should politely have told Francesca that when she offered to host.", "Yes, I said that.

That is on us though.\n\nBut presuming she wouldn't be able to have the day catered is fairly obvious, because we're all aware of the cost for catering and roughly aware of the financial situation of George and Francesca.

We know that she was told that she was asked by someone and OP didn't say no, but it feels like she isn't aware that the entire family begged OP to host and none of them wanted to from the moment Francesca asked to host.\n\nThat's why I don't think Francesca is an asshole; if she doesn't have the whole story, how can she be an asshole with the knowledge she has? Plus, the entire family agreed and then backed out, making the decision FOR Francesca before she had any idea. Why SHOULDN'T she be pissed off? Only her husband filled her in after the decision was made, and nobody else came to talk to her like an adult about it.\n\nI think Francesca needs to also be mad at the family, but I get the feeling she has no idea that the entire family is also to blame, not just a couple of people.

So the point is they want to go somewhere where they can eat and drink all for free and without putting any work in and stay there for the night so they don\u2019t have to pay for an Uber or decide on an DD? If catering is so expensive your brother and SIL cannot afford it why isn\u2019t everyone chipping in. Why is it totally normal for you to host all family events and pay for them without the rest of the family contributing? They re all adults and have their own money and they want to eat and drink so they should contribute (money and helping you prepare). Making one person pay for everything all the time (even if they should be better off) would be unthinkable in my family.", "Offering maybe. Throwing a fit and demanding to host when your guests realize how inconvenient it will be and the conversation shifts tos changing the venue, is not a nice gesture at all.

Not one of us cares about the cost, we just enjoy spending time with each other.\n\nI regularly visit my parents for a week at a time. Am I using their money and house when I do? No. I'm there to visit. I really don't understand how you see hosting a family gathering (and footing the bill because yes that is part of hosting) as people taking advantage of you.\n\nI am not bashing the layout of their house. An open plan kitchen/dining room will not allow staff to prepare and serve food without disruption, that's not bashing, that's just a fact.", "Re the cost, my mum and stepdad hosted and paid for Christmas for a decade before I started doing it. It's just a thing you do, in our family, my bio-dad's family is the same, so is my stepdad's extended family. Yes, the cost of hosting a whole family dinner is large, but it's not breaking anyone's bank. I'm not sure if this is normal elsewhere but I've never been asked to chip in the cost of a dinner party in my family, or with friends or their families. I've always been told, and experienced, that the host pays. Obviously you bring wine or a hostess gift to a dinner but I've never heard of people contributing money or food.", "> the conversation shifts tos changing the venue\n\nA conversation *she* was not included in.  The first she heard that people weren\u2019t happy about her hosting was when they\u2019d already made up their minds she wasn\u2019t going to any more.  If they don\u2019t want to go to her thing, she can\u2019t make them, but OP and family can at *least* do her the courtesy of acknowledging *they* were the ones who upended the plans here.

(Which *also* doesn\u2019t do anything to help dispel the impression that this is less about Francesca\u2019s house and more about the fact no one wants an \u201coutsider\u201d changing up their precious family gathering, except they can\u2019t even be honest and upfront about that.)", "I never said I didn't want to host. If I didn't want to, I wouldn't, and my mum would have stepped in and done it instead. I just pointed out that it's not something I live for, or was waiting in the wings to do.\n\nAs for involving Francesca, I don't cook when I host, when I do Christmas or any other gathering, it's catered, so there's no asking her to come and help with xyz, unless she wants to come over for the tasting. If she wanted to come and cook in my kitchen instead of catering, I suppose she could, but that would be a ridiculous amount of work for her.", "YTA & so is your family\n\nInstead of agreeing to host you should have spoken to your sil & ask if there is anything you could do to help her.

Further proof that this is something she wants very much because, if she didn't want to do it, backing out would have been very easy at this point. \n\nNot wanting any share of the responsibilities for Christmas finally motivates everyone to shift everything on to you, because that makes it so much easier on them. \n\nAnd to top it all off, having a group chat where y'all make decisions for the whole family without including everyone's partners is bullshit. Doing shit like this is probably why Francesca doesn't feel included in the family. \n\nRather than have an adult conversation with his wife and explain that he also doesn't want to host Christmas, your stepbrother decides to pull the ultimate AH move and throw you under the bus. \n\nYou're ultimately left holding the bag and unable to defend yourself because y'all made all these decisions behind her back. \n\nThe way your family went about this sucks and all of you should apologize.

I think offering her a role to play might help", "NTA\u2026but, seriously?  All these people who are family? Overnight guests as well?  You should not be doing all of the work, nor be expected to pay for it all and then clean up after everyone.  It would be one thing if it is a one time thing, but this yearly.  You are all family.  There is no reason not everyone can not chip in in some way, shape or form.  This would make it less stressful for you.  Francesca has the right idea by asking everyone to help out and contribute an item, especially with such a large group.   I like the idea of her helping you, or better yet, you helping her.  You all can make it work, the others just don\u2019t want to.  Why would they?  They have the convenience if you doing everything, coming in, enjoying themselves and then leaving?  Oy.   How far you from George?  Could they still not stay with you overnight?", "NTA If I were you I would keep rubbing it in her face that she is an utter failure for not even being able to host a small gathering and even her husband doesn't trust her, just to be petty", "George is the real asshole here. Francesca should be mad at him, not you. He needs to grow a backbone and communicate with his wife. NTA.", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s the biggest AH for not talking to his wife. Your SIL is the AH for taking on something she can\u2019t handle. She volunteered to host but then made changes and told everyone to bring their own dishes. You guys won\u2019t even be able to stay over at their house for Christmas because their house is too small. And it just feel like she was stupid, not understanding what she was taking on despite wanting it. But your brother is still the biggest AH.", "Agree with this, you need George to sort this. NTA.", "I wonder if Francesca talked it through with George before offering to host.", "It\u2019s crazy that they don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s upset because she literally told them. She wanted to host because she thought it would finally make her part of the family. Obviously her strategy is pretty misguided, that holiday party change sounds unappealing to me and that\u2019s not even how family is supposed to work, anyway. But instead of reassuring her that she\u2019s part of the family and making sure she feels included at the usual Christmas gathering, they proved her interpretation of the family dynamic is correct by being too uncomfortable to communicate with her when she\u2019s making conversation with them, talking about it behind her back, and changing her plans without her input. Honestly it\u2019s impressive that Francesca is even trying to make an effort in such an awkward and unreceptive environment. This must have been so hurtful. \n\nI can get why OP doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s the asshole because she really just played a passive role in this and she\u2019s getting the brunt of the blame that belongs to everyone. It\u2019s not overtly asshole behavior, it\u2019s just kinda\u2026 clueless and tactless. But I really think her brother should be taking responsibility for this, he\u2019s the one allowing his family act like Francesca is an outsider unchecked and participating in it, too.", "I do think the family is stupid for not TELLING Francesca they didn\u2019t want to do it at her house, but did you miss the part where she blames everything on OP? AH move.", "Absolutely agree. The hosting of the big family dinners for us has been moved to the home of the oldest nephew and his wife. They have recently finished remodeling their kitchen because they enjoy hosting and cooking big meals (the remodel included dual ovens and some other contraption to cook things in). But still, as far as I'm aware, everyone who came to Thanksgiving last week brought  something to contribute to the meal, and there were so many people that we had to sit at two different large dining tables, and one spouse in each couple had to forego drinking to be the designated driver.\n\nIf the family members were a little more supportive, this could have been a really great time for everyone to let Francesca feel more like part of the family.\n\nEdited for typos", "Also OP saying that she didn\u2019t understand how important it was to Francesca is BS. Nobody goes out of their way to lobby the traditional host (OP or her parents) if it isn\u2019t important.", "Them not talking to her and deciding FOR her before telling her is why I think it's the former judgement.

Occasionally at an informal dinner with just me, my husband, and one other couple someone's brought a dessert. But at large dinners, you don't bring something to be eaten at that meal. Maybe it's an American thing?\n\nI don't hate hosting, it's just not my favourite thing. The point I was trying to make is that I wasn't sitting there rubbing my hands together desperate to do it and waiting for this to happen.", "I think this whole situation makes it pretty clear why she doesn't feel a part of the family. They won't give up their tradition one time, they talk about her behind her back, and her own fiance stabs her in the back.", "Well, my mum and stepdad did it for a decade, and still host some things throughout the year.

God forbid she ask her family for help with cooking and making food. The family is the biggest assholes for not communicating their problems with Francesca and going behind her back.

But I've never been to any large family gathering without each sub-family showing up with a covered dish. \n\nFirst time my parents and my future in-laws merged at Thanksgiving, my mother showed up with a green bean casserole as big as a billboard. (Before anyone asks, this was my MIL's answer to my mother after the \"what can I bring?\" question)\n\nFeel like it would be a lot easier for all of you to suck it up, deal with the small house for one year and let Francesca realize it was something she never wanted to do again.", "After more of your replies, I sort of see where you are coming from.  I am in the US and for the most part, when we get together, we all contribute in some way.  The host provides the main fare and family/guests will bring whatever to contribute.  But most like to do so.  It is fun to try out new things and old favorites.  There is a lot of mis communication in this family group chat.  Someone, and I think it has to be you, needs to get everything straightened out.  First I think you need to talk with George and Francesca and sort things out.  Then whatever you all decide between you, you go to the rest and say this is how it is going to be this year.  I still think that you will find most people here think it is crummy that in this large of a family group gathering, so much is expected of whoever is hosting.  Maybe if you had more help, you would not find hosting so tedious.", "For places not in the US it\u2019s quite far, like in the UK you\u2019d plan to stay over.

Her feelings are obviously hurt in this and she's taking it out on you which is not appropriate. If she's not feeling accepted by the family, this is the bigger core issue at hand that also needs to be addressed.... by everyone. It doesn't sound like she's just upset at this one time event. It sounds like there is a huge underlying unresolved issue that is fueling her reaction to this.", "Except Francesca insisted on hosting and days after getting the go ahead she started adding extra requirements and limitations.", "She changed the invitation - it went from \u201cI\u2019m making Christmas dinner\u201d, to which everyone agreed, to \u201cI\u2019m providing the space for a potluck Christmas dinner\u201d, to which some people then said no.\n\nShe changed the terms of the event, turning it from something people didn\u2019t love but were willing to deal with the inconvenience to do (travelling for multiple hours), into something where the inconveniences outweighed the benefits (making food, travelling for multiple hours with it, then reheating).

Is she supposed to always check with Francesca when her brother says something is ok with Francesca?", "I agree the biggest AH by far is George. He seriously sucks.

Then minor AHs for the rest of the family. \n\nIf I was Francesca, I'd be spending this year's holidays with my own family.", "no, she asked if they could *host* and everyone said yes despite not wanting her to. they are AHs for avoiding any sort of adult conversation or communication with her, leading her be in this position.", "She's not trying to be a part of the tradition, she's trying to change up the tradition.\n\nThe family are still AH for how they handled not saying no properly, but I can see why the SIL's insistence on hosting isn't particularly well-received.", "It would have been polite to discuss it with Francesca, since she was the host at the time.", "The answer is to sound concerned and tell her your brother said she was stressed out and from the sounds out it regrets her decision to host.

They were willing to put up with a less enjoyable, inconvenient Christmas because Francesca wanted to host, and then she decided she wanted to ditch more traditions and make them do work too and they noped out, because  accepting one pile of crap doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ve accepted unlimited additional piles.", "Not having the story doesn\u2019t excuse her behaviour or attacking OP. Her expression of her anger is not actually okay even though you\u2019re excusing it.", "...all she did was ask. She didn't demand anything, she asked, which would have allowed them all to say no. It never hurts to ask and if OP and her family had been honest from the start, Francesca wouldn't have had Christmas at her house. If OP and her family had talked to her, Francesca may have agreed and seen why hosting at her place was not feasible. \n\nFrancesca never demanded, she asked.

She was treated like a child who needed decisions made for her. Of course Francesca could have handled it better, but I don't think she's an asshole in ANY way for having a human response with the information she had. Who wouldn't be upset if they were thought to be hosting a big party and then finding out that, oops, they're not anymore and someone else is and they have no say in the decision? I genuinely don't see the issue in Francesca getting angry if she truly thought OP made the decision herself or happily did it without talking to the actual host before saying yes.\n\nIt's not like Francesca was spewing vile language at OP; she expressed that she was upset for OP not declining hosting and then she said that she felt like OP was taking over so Francesca would still be an outsider. Maybe not correct feelings, but nothing vile or mean or insulting in any way.\n\nI'm only upset Francesca isn't mad at EVERYONE in the family. They all deserve getting confronted on the decision made behind her back.", "You say no one cares about the cost, but no where do I see any of this family coming to your home in any way shape or firm contributes to anything other than just showing up.  Does not matter what your parents did or did not do.  And if cost is not a concern, then speak to George and Francesca and suggest catering.

Call them up and talk to them in the phone.", "Honestly fair. I have some experience in catering and a small kitchen would be much harder. Not undoable but timing would have to be different, menu tweaked so things aren't getting cold if there's no room for hot boxes.

That\u2019s the kind of self-pitying narcissism my depression likes to spit up when it gets severe. Unless someone has been going out of their way previously to be a dick, it\u2019s incredibly unlikely they care enough to spend the effort to sabotage me, especially when there\u2019s a more obvious other reason like the alternative everyone wants being objectively better at everything except pandering to me.", "It does matter, because when I'm at their home I contribute nothing other than a bottle of wine, which is the same as they do at mine. It's symbiotic.\n\nWhen I say cost is not a concern, it isn't to me, or to my parents. The cost of the catering I use, for example, is not feasible for Francesca and George.

There are polite ways of saying it. And then to decide that you're taking over, without even considering her feelings (why would she offer to host if it wasn't important to her? Why does she have the feeling she is not part of the family yet, and this would give her that chance?) You all need to apologize to her, and her husband even more so.

Ya got caught in a rough spot. Clearly hosting was important to your SIL but you arent a mind reader. George seems like the actual asshole here because it seems like he framed the situation differently to one or both parties. It seems like HE wasn't too keen on hosting, sold the group on how stressed his partner was, told you all he would ask her what she wanted to do given your being asked to take over, then either bungled or misrepresented the group discussion to her. SIL, I'm on the fence. I can see her being pissed depending on what chain of events ahe was told leading to you catching heat for seemingly no reason. However, again you arent a mind reader. If you truly explained that you weren't the one to offer the change in venue, and that's true as well, then she becomes the asshole if she continues to sulk about it rather than engage in a discussion over it. Theres still a month to Christmas. Surely theres time to discuss and come to an understanding.", "NTA but George sure is.

It's one Christmas. Stop for one second and think about how Francesca must feel about getting ganged up on and rejected by her inlaws. That must be painful.

It's understandable that she's hurt, but your family are to blame. (I also think that if she offered to host, she should have been prepared to figure out the cooking situation. I hosted Christmas two years ago in a house with a tiny oven and managed to make it all work, only thing brought by guests was dessert. and we managed to cook it all because, well, everything can be staggered. It doesn't all go in the oven at the same time. I think the real problem here is your family excluding her. Like, why isn't she part of this family group chat, to begin with? She's your SIL, so she's part of the family. I think everyone here needs to take a step back and look at the way this situation affects everyone else.", "esh, but not Francesca.

Would it have been that hard for every member of the family to bring something to cook it doesn't have to be prepared on scratch that day. The fact that you all went behind her back to say that is rude, no wonder she doesn't feel part of the family. I wonder how the other spouses feel. You all could have had a discussion, and she could have talked about it. Planning holidays is stressful, but you know what, you figure it out.

You made a decision for the whole family without once asking Francesca. It does not matter if her house or kitchen is small or if she asked for some help by requesting to do the party pot-luck style. Family gatherings are not all about who has the biggest house. If everyone was so unhappy with the arrangements they should have said no right then and there instead of leading her on.

She offered a kindness and everyone said yes and then planned a party at your place behind her back. \n\nShe wanted to do something kind for the family, and instead it became all about her not having a big enough house to keep you all happy. She may never have a bigger house. She should still be able to host the family for the holidays. I can see why she does not feel like she belongs in the family, with everyone including her own husband excluding her and putting her through that.

Yet you've also stated that the money is no object to you. Why not offer to help with the cost, then? \n\nThat's just one tiny example in a sea of glaring inconsistencies in your family's so-called \"concerns\" - the point is that, if it were really just about the space/the finances/not wanting her to be stressed, there were 1000 other solutions that should have been incredibly easy for an entire family of adults to think up and offer. I think you all knew what you were doing, vetoing her desire to host behind her back - and all these so-called \"concerns\" about Francesca were just justifications to save face while still going going ahead with something you all absolutely knew was sleazy and hurtful.

That sounds like a recipe for a Christmas full of passive aggression! \n\nIt's also unlikely Francesca will be appreciative of the offer-- it could too easily come across as a pity-driven attempt at a weak olive branch designed to make OP feel better and force Francesca to stop complaining. It might just add insult to injury.", "I have a huge Mexican family, 15 blood related aunts and uncles just on one side, 8 on the other side, as you can imagine everyone's financial situations vary and I am quite used to humble homes and sleeping en masse on living room floors. There are some who insist on hosting and have the smallest places and frankly *I'd rather they didn't if there's someone else offering who can handle the mass of people*. With us the family is all spread between the living room, tiny bedrooms, tiny kitchen, outside (which is cold during holidays) , inside is very crowded  and you have to squeeze past people, there are 6 people squeezed onto each 3 seater couch and only 2 couches. It's not ideal but I don't mind as much because they live 10 minutes away and it's convenient enough- would I attend if the home was hours away like OP and can't stay over and I can't drink and I have to bring something that's already prepared? Perhaps **out of pure obligation to make some family members happy,** but I certainly would be annoyed and stressed at the huge inconvenience and would rather go somewhere more convenient if it was an option. The last couple years I've avoided the big extended family holidays, it has been so much nicer to enjoy a quiet peaceful holiday this way for me and my immediate family. But then again- I see my extended family very often (Mexicans love their parties) so it doesn't matter either way if I miss them for a holiday, I realize maybe for others that's the only time they may see them and so it's a bigger deal. I just think in  OP's situation it's a matter of one option being very inconvenient, uncomfortable and stressful for everyone involved, whereas the other arrangement has worked for years and is convenient/comfortable for everyone (other than SIL's hurt feelings about wanting to host). Everyone went about the whole thing the wrong way in OP's scenario, but I can 100% see why no one wants to go there for the holidays when they have 2 other more logical options- like OP or her parents' home, which would be so much more enjoyable and not so obviously limited.", "The statement was rhetorical, because even if she and George covered half the cost, which it would be financially irresponsible for them to do if it were even possible, I'm not going to pay thousands of pounds for someone else to host dinner, that's absurd. It's also absurd for us all to shell out x amount each, if we divided it up amongst all the siblings, to be tripping over each other all day and have to drive back. Now, were this the only option, of course, seeing each other would have trumped the inconvenience, but it isn't the only option.\n\nAnd to your point, it's true, none of us really wanted her to host, because we knew from day dot it was impractical. However, this wasn't a giant scheme. I, for my part, was fully prepared to suck it up and deal with whatever happened. As was everyone else, until the \"pot-luck\" question came up. Had everyone else not said anything, I wouldn't have, and had I not been asked to host, I wouldn't have offered. But for sure, we all knew this was a bad idea. And yes, we are absolute morons for saying it sooner.", "Honestly I would be more willing to bring a dish if my sister asked because her husband cannot cook but I can't host it at my house.", "See, if you actually want to gain some perspective here (and not just try to defend yourself), the way you're phrasing this is a huge AH red flag - for me and I think a lot of other commenters: \"We all knew this was a bad idea\". You continually refuse to acknowledge the fact that you JUST DON'T WANT to make this work - you keep phrasing it as some kind of immutable truth of nature, that it just \"is\" a \"bad idea\", never owning that you and your family were a bunch of AH about it from the very beginning, not offering any kind of help or solutions to help make it work. This is a subtle way of continually putting Francesca down, framing her desire to host as a \"bad idea\" instead of a situation with some challenges you could easily have helped address if you actually wanted to. It's also a coward's way out of responsibility, pretending you were all powerless to make circumstances work when you are so clearly not. If you have the means to shell out \"thousands of pounds\" to have this event catered at your own house, there's simply no way you're convincing anyone here that you were oh so very powerless in the face of this catastrophically \"bad idea\". You just didn't WANT to do it differently/accommodate Francesca's different circumstances, and you didn't care about even trying to make it work, ever, no matter how that would make Francesca feel.\n\nAnd honestly? You're entitled to your preferences. But don't act surprised when people think YTA when you and your family evidently prefer to be selfish, dishonest and manipulative than not have things go the way you're used to this one year.", "All the time, but not for Christmas dinner.", "I appreciate the little sparkle, thank you!", "What is there to appreciate when things when they were fine before she volunteered and they all had to downgrade? What was there to acknowledge when there was no effort needed to be made? It just felt very obvious to me that people wouldn\u2019t appreciate it. Like, be for real, common sense: Would you like it if you had downsize for Christmas just because someone wanted to be acknowledged for their effort of doing something that didn\u2019t need to be fixed?\n\nI think SIL\u2019s feelings of not being included stem from the brother not OP. I also feel like her feelings are very valid though. OP mentioned they had a group chat of just their mother, step-father and siblings (from before they all married) and they\u2019d normally chat there. OP\u2019s husband isn\u2019t bothered by it neither are the other spouses. This makes me question how the brother explained it to SIL. Again, not OP\u2019s problem to solve. Not to mention he made a decision for his wife without getting her permission. She obviously wanted to host and loved the idea while the brother said that she was stressed and needed a break. Why did Francesca take her frustration out on OP when the her husband was the problem? I just feel like the issues and problems shouldn\u2019t fall on the OP is all. So she\u2019s definitely not the AH here.", "Yikes!  \n\nDon\u2019t your parents know that alienating their DIL leads to less time spent with future grandkids?\n\nFrancesca got the message that she\u2019s not really family\u2026 guess where she (and possibly George if she stays with him) will be spending all major holidays from now on?  Spoiler: not with you guys!", "NTA of course. Francesca\u2019s reaction is excessive, unreasonable and unfair. She deserves for you to graciously back out and permit her to host the event to her heart\u2019s content.", "NTA. But you shouldn\u2019t be bearing the cost of hosting on your own.  Everyone should contribute money.  You say they aren\u2019t taking advantage of you but they really are.  You\u2019re in the fog.", "Additionally, they all said yes. That alone makes everyone else (aside from Francesca) TAs, even if they had fair reasons. No wonder Francesca's hurt", "This is how my family does it - host family makes the main and everyone else brings sides and desserts.  The same person always volunteers for paper plates, cups, and plastic silverware to decrease the dishwashing.  This way no one is out a fortune or is busy the whole day.", "I love the idea of cohosting, what a great thought.", "That's sweet; a bouquet for the table!", "It's kinda absurd, when there is a good sized place that everyone else want to be at already.", "NAH, but your family needs to rethink their approach to this.\n\nThe family decided to move the dinner without asking Francesca. She clearly wanted to host, or she wouldn't have asked. You agreed to step in, but the family railroaded the decision. I would be pretty pissed if I were Francesca. George should have known this was not the proper way to handle it. I'm not sure this will be a pleasant Christmas for you all.", "ESH except Francesca. The biggest AH is George for not shutting y'all down instantly. \n\nSince you know what goes into hosting and planning, you know she's probably already put a lot of time and effort into this. But, you all get into your \"family chat of parents and siblings only\" you go behind her back and change everything on her. Instead of talking to her in the group chat she's in discussing the plans! So incredibly rude. \n\n>She accused me of ruining her chance to finally be part of the family\n\nI want to point this out. Because how you all overrided the plans in a private chat does make you seem cliquish. And I can completely see why she doesn't feel a part of your family. You completely treated her like an outsider.", "YTA.  Everyone agreed to let Francesca host and then went behind her back to change it, you included.  You agreed to host the moment others asked you to without checking if it was okay from Francesca and then claim you didn't know it was important to her.  You didn't know it was important despite the fact that Francesca asked to host it despite never hosting it before, despite having a smaller house and smaller kitchen?  Come on there is no reason a person would agree to all that unless they saw it as important and it's BS to act like you didn't know.", "You are definitely TA! So what if her place is small and y'all can't drink. You should have refused but I believe you feel your home and kitchen are better so you now begrudgingly accept to pull the hosting duties yourself. Step down off of that pedestal.", "ESH except for Francesca. \n\nYou guys decided things in a group chat without her or without consulting her. \n\n\nAnd the \u201cwe thought we\u2019d do her a favor\u201d doesn\u2019t count. \n\nPutting your help onto people without them asking for it is offensive (I had to learn that one too and it was kind of enlightening. I\u2019m a very helpful person and always thought I would do people good by helping them. It never occurred to me that this could be offensive). \n\nBut it is because it can imply that I \n\n- either don\u2019t think the person is able to do it on their own \n\n- or because I think that they might be able to do it, but that I can do it better. \n\nSo: don\u2019t force unsolicited help onto others and don\u2019t forego adult people without them even knowing. \n\nESH.", "Why not just retract your offer to host this year. Explain your sister on law is upset at having it taken away and you realize you had interfered needed to correct the imposition. Stick with that.\n\nIf the holiday goes badly, consider it a sacrifice everyone has to make since you weren\u2019t supported by family and now your sister in law has a grievance.", "YTA. Having Christmas at her house may be inconvenient, but it was something she really wanted to do and not nice of you to upstage her that way. This one time everyone can suck it up and travel to her place. Christmas is about giving and grace. The least your family could do is let this girl host Christmas. Where is the X-Mas spirit here?", ">He said that she was stressed but if she expressed it, it was to her husband. \n\nI don't know a single person who hosts a big event that *isn't* stressed. I'm sure George has never hosted an event by what he said. Acting like there's something wrong with her or that she's \"over her head\" because she shows some emotion is such an AH move. Talk about belittling someone! This whole family's attitude is offputting. Like she can't do this because she asked them to bring some dishes... a totally normal thing.", "Imagine the horror of actually having to help the host /s", "I got the feeling the whole \u201cI don\u2019t enjoy hosting\u201d may not have been entirely honest, even if Op may not be admitting it to herself.", "YES, thank you! All this retroactive justifying bullshit seems like just a way of stepping around the glaring turd on the floor which was the entire family's toxic passive aggression.", "I love to bake and cook - but it is a big inconvenience to make something that has to be driven for a long distance before being served/reheated.  I could definitely do a dessert - but most things served hot would be harder - either loose flavor being reheated or just would have to be made before a long drive.  Plus - even if you are reheating everything you still only have one oven and a small kitchen the entire family now needs to jostle around in to reheat their dishes.", "Traditions can (and should) shift, as family situations do.\n\nIn my family, there's probably more sharing, and less hosting.\n\nWhich house it's at depends on the weather (I had the bigger house, but no aircon, my mother had a smaller house/kitchen, but did have aircon).\n\nPretty much the same people do their 'signature' food each year. Brother who doesn't cook brings the beer. We try to keep the costs about even per person.\n\nClean up and dish washing is shared.", "It's not like they don't want her to host because they think she's ugly and smelly- her house is far away and smaller than the space they would need - that isn't a personal failing, it is something she needs to recognize.  People don't want to drive that long to only stay a few hours is something she needs to know.  \n\nMy husband has a group of friends I love and the person who normally hosts their get together hasn't been able to the last few years. I would personally love to host them so I could see everyone, but everyone except me would have to drive two hours with kids, and I'm self aware enough to realize no one really wants to do that - I am not a good choice to host.  It isn't a personal failing on my part - but also a thing I need to remind of sometimes.", "This is the best way. I\u2019m sure Francesca feels terrible for being fired from hosting, even if she bit off more than she could chew. OP, how far are you from her? Can you make it a shared holiday?", "The fact that OP argues Francesca\u2019s small kitchen is a disqualification from hosting *when the family norm is to have the food catered* is a nice little detail of total hypocrisy.", "YTA, and so are your brothers.  You should have just said, \u201cNo, Francesca wanted to host.  Let\u2019s support her in this. It\u2019ll be fun to try something new.\u201d What happened instead is why in-laws gets bad rap.", "It\u2019s about money in the end. The family didn't want to tell Francesca that she was too poor to host the holiday in the style to which they were accustomed.", "We have so many people bringing appetizers and sides at our family holiday parties that for the first time ever this year I gave up and just brought decorative candles after asking \"Can I bring deviled eggs?\" *No, your father is bringing them because he wants to try a new recipe.* \"How about the squash?\" *No, we have that covered.* \"Pie?\" *We have apple, pumpkin, and caramel machiatto and ice cream and cheese cake* \"Wine? Scotch?\" *Oh we have all that and your cousin brewed two different kinds of beer* \"GREEN BEANS?\" *We have casserole and also saut\u00e9ed with bacon. Just bring yourself.* Me: \"AAAAARRRRGH!", "But the thing is they don\u2019t want to do work. She usually has it catered. I would be pissed if someone was asking to do something that would end up causing me more work", "Well said.  We have had to revise our traditions as the family has grown and what we did in the past does not work anymore.  Covid gave us the \"pause\" we needed and new traditions abound.", "I see your point, although we usually shift around a small kitchen by people arriving earlier and using crockpots or portable grills to reheat things as needed. Then again, that\u2019s my family tradition, and everyone has a crockpot or two, a portable grill, etc, which if OP\u2019s family doesn\u2019t again it\u2019s an added expense shifted. I completely see why people are feeling inconvenienced, and also why the person hosting thinks this is all fixable: both are correct", ">a number of you suggested Francesca could come and cook at my home, as that would allow her some 'hosting', and that's certainly something I will consider\n\nFrancesca is not likely to agree. Francesca ikely wants to host because she wants full credit.  I doubt she'll settle for partial credit. The event will always be remembered as your event, at your house and she'll be an \"et al\" when mentioned.  \n\nIt's still not your fault that even though she pushed to host it she doesn\u2019t have the space, ability to cook or organize the sufficient amounts of food...  and she's suddenly asking everyone to bring a dish. Also unfair people can't stay over which will limit the alcohol. It's a really big celebration. \n\nDoes she really not see how ill-equipped she is to host this event?\n\nNTA", "It's THE celebration of the year for most families. This family traditionally spends it together. \n\nFrancesca pushes to host, but suddenly she needs a lot of extra help, and other members now have to cook because she insists on hosting?  If she wanted to host she needed to have had a plan in place for how to feed that many people before pushing to host. \n\nHer need to host is inconveniencing the whole family. Maybe she should pick a different holiday to host.  \n\nIt's obviously a little more than she fantasized she could handle.", "It can also depend on how far you\u2019re traveling. I\u2019m always told just to bring myself since we (me, my husband and our boys) come from out of state for holidays. Everyone else better show up with something \ud83e\udd23"]}
