If she cannot respect me, she cannot have access. Husband, if you choose to maintain a relationship with your hateful mother, that is fine but it will NOT include my child.

You cannot deny your husband from seeing his mom. But you can go LC for her to see her grandchild. I would go NC after she kicked you out of the family.", "NTA\n\nThat is wildly inappropriate. Minimize your future contact with this woman. Don\u2019t allow her any influence over your child too, she can be the grandmother your kid sees very infrequently.", "NTA. I hope you and your husband put on a united front in terms of how much if any time you  and your family spend with MIL. It's MIL right to be done with you, and in turn it's your right for you and your child to be done with MIL.", "Yeah, NTA. She insulted you, belittled you, and gaslit you over a speech. What is her major malfunction?", "NTA. Good on your husband for getting involved! I know a lot of cases like this where the husband won\u2019t go against the mother, even if he knows she\u2019s wrong. Props to him. I would have felt the same way that you are in this scenario and if she is so delusional to think she isn\u2019t wrong, then she did you a favor by cutting you out.", "NTA - don\u2019t you dare \u2018keep the peace\u2019 the only people who need you to are the people who will constantly disrespect you and use it against you and escalate their bad behavior", "I think your husband should\u2019ve stood up & cut MIL off when the speech went south - maybe with a joke about how much she\u2019d had to drink. This was horrible & designed purely to upset you - don\u2019t you DARE apologise & don\u2018t accept anything but a real apology from her. Husband has seen what she\u2019s like now, that\u2019s why he\u2019s upset. On the only bright side, you now have the right to never see her again & family & friends already know why.", "NTA.  And clearly your husband also thinks her behaviour was awful. \n\nBut your MIL sort of presented a solution here - she said she is done with YOU. So that makes going contact simple. Because any other contact means that you have to grovel to her to get her to accept you, which should not happen. \n\nWhat exactly does your husband see as next steps, given that his mother has decided to cut you off?", "NTA. But if you get an apology, will it really make a difference? Chances are MIL won't actually mean it, and somehow I doubt it will actually make you feel any better. The performance she put on at your husband's party was atrocious. She told you who she really is, and how she really feels about you. I don't know what the solution is, but I really don't think an apology will help, so you will have to figure out another solution.", "NTA. But never demand an apology from anyone. If they feel obligated just to appease you, the apology you get will be more upsetting than the event. She'll apologise if she's truly sorry", "NTA because you\u2019re not the cause of the conflict between him and his mum. His mum is.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is a horror show. Your hubby better firm up that spine. If he caves to his mom, start packing, cuz it's the end.", "NTA. However, for anyone out there, when things like this happen to you, you start to laugh a lot, and people around begin to think the one giving the speech is joking. It changes the dynamics on your side.", "Nta - you totally have a MIL problem.", "NTA . This post is probably more appropriate for r/JUSTNOMIL .", "I don't think you're necessarily in the wrong but I personally don't understand why you feel it is worth getting this upset over.

You absolutely need to shut this woman out of your life. And your husband has shown spine here. Don't feel sorry for him, encourage it.", "After the speech your husband was right to be upset.

Your MILFH ( from hell) is trying to break you up because she hopes your husband will marry the other woman.", "NTA she definitely needed a reality check. I am glad your husband is on your side that the speech she gave was inappropriate; I hope you eventually get that apology.", "NTA. You were too polite. I would have gone head to head and not stopped until she was silent. Every statement meet with that absolute anger. Don\u2019t let up. Don\u2019t be silenced. Don\u2019t be bullied.

She basically announced in a speech in front of all his friends and family that you were not the woman she wanted for him and it made her sad enough to cry.  What the fuck!!! If I were you, she would be dead to me I mean really dead. Never speak to her again, never allow her in your home.\n If your husband has a problem with that, he can see her at her house.  Although, if it were me and my parent disrespected my spouse that way, my parent would never be in my home again.  Why should you have to put up with this? What is wrong with your husband that he expects you to put up with this?  Have some self-respect and cut that evil hag out of your life.", "NTA no you should not have taken the disrespect.  MIL is terrible, and needs to feel consequences from her terrible behavior.  It will be hard for your husband, but he needs to be the one forcing a change here, even if that means cutting her off for a while.", "NTA- Both your hubby and MIL owe you an apology. He should have handled this better. Heavy toll my ass.", "*I have a question?Did those same people coming up to you asking WTF also go up to your mother in law and say wtf what kind of asshole are you?*  ***Your husband should have confronted your MIL*** *until someone tells your mother in law what she did wrong she isn\u2019t going to get it*", "The mistake you made was not confronting her there when it happened. It's easy for her to hide behind text messages and not take your concerns seriously. You're all adults, you should not be having these discussions over text.", "NTA \n\nListen, if you feel like the AH and want to back down because of your husband\u2019s feelings, just know that this sets the precedent and this will be your life til she\u2019s gone. If you\u2019re fine with that, good luck. \n\nAlso, people\u2019s word means jack. Watch their actions and don\u2019t accept shitty apologies.", "Gaslighting ratbag!  Hahaha!!! Omg, so funny!", "When guests come up to you to assure you that it was weird af and APOLOGIZE, it isn't in your head or to be shrugged off. \n\nAlso, dude, she cried. Over some rando.", "I agree, this post makes me really angry on your behalf. This is the time to go scorched Earth.  Never be in the same room with her again, never speak to her on the phone again. Your husband can do what he wants, but do you want to be married to a man who would let someone disrespect you in front of all your friends and family?"]}
