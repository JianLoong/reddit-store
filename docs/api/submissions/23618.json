He clearly had some issues relating to other people, and his way of dealing with it was to be a sort of prickly personality. \n\nOne day, my parents got a call from our school principal. This kid\u2019s mom had called the school to complain about the incessant bullying that her son was dealing with, and he pointed me out specifically as the ring leader. She said that he cried everyday before school and asked her not to take him. She also said that he prayed to God everyday that me and the rest of the kids would stop making fun of him.\n\nThe weird part is that I had no idea at all that I was this kid\u2019s bully. I was abused a lot growing up, and I was very sheltered. I was also watching a lot of Saved by the Bell back them. I never really new how to be a person, so I had always patterned myself around tv shows and movies along with whatever my mom wanted me to be like at any given time. The cool guy in the show always makes fun of Screech, and I desperately wanted to be the cool guy. \n\nI pretty much just made fun of the kid all the time just like Zach did to Screech. I guess it made me feel cool and gave me a tiny sliver of power in an otherwise powerless existence. I stopped after the phone call and after realizing what I was really doing, but the damage was already done.\n\nI hit a breaking point with my birth family in my 30s, had a whole mental breakdown, and eventually started some pretty intense trauma therapy (EMDR + CBT + IFS) and have been going weekly without fail for 5+ years. \n\nI understand things a lot better now. I have been NC with my toxic family for years, and I am a much different person than I was back then. I\u2019m actually very chill, quite nerdy, and I spend a lot of my time and energy trying to help kids who are in similar tough situations.\n\nI think about this kid a lot, about what it was like for him dealing with that kind of anxiety and ridicule everyday. I still to this day can\u2019t believe I did what I did.\n\nOn a whim, I googled his name today and was surprised to find his address and phone number pretty quickly. I\u2019m not on social media, and I guess I never thought it would be so easy to find this guy\u2019s info.\n\nIf you were him, would you be pissed if your old bully called you to apologize and explain himself? Or would it be a positive thing for you? He might just tell me to fuck off and die, but if that is cathartic for him then I\u2019ll take it.

If you end up indeed doing something I would suggest some written form rather than call/visit. Either email or letter and make sure it is known it's from you in the first place. In case he is not okay with you contacting him that way he can just choose to ignore it without reading - he has an absolute right to do so... he could also take his time reading and thinking of what he wants to do next etc.. .If you suddenly call/visit him you would give him no choice but to interact with you to some degree and since you are no therapy rookie you should know the best why that's not a nice thing to do.", "Another poster put it quite eloquently..

Personally - i don't think an apology or explanation would fix a messed up childhood - however - you can ask yourself:  \nWould it help if your mum apologized? Would it help if she explains why she did it?\n\nSeeing yo go no contact with your family - i'd kinda expect the answer to be no... But - that's just my guess.", "~~N-A-H~~. YWBTA. I'm 40s and was briefly bullied by two people in high school. One who's name I can't recall I last saw in my 20s when I returned home for my wedding and he was bussing the table. The other who's name I know I presume is either in prison or dead. If they reached out and apologized? I mean, I'd think it was cool that they turned their lives around. I'd say a kind word or two? It probably matters more to you than to them. Hope it goes well!\n\nETA - After not looking up the fellow in 28 years, I finally looked up my bully for one year. My freshman year he was a junior who literally threw a younger kid out a window for standing up to him. I see two burglary felonies, then a deadbeat dad to 3 kids, but then 16yrs ago got an art degree, and he now does truck rolls for Comcast. Villains deserve worse. :p\n\nOn second thought, I'd prefer not to hear from them, especially if their goal was to unburden their conscience. If they were offering financial restitution, maybe.", "i honestly think it would piss me off,\ni see where you\u2019re coming from and it feels like your intentions are genuine,\nbut if it were me in his shoes, i think id see it as you using me to make yourself feel better, therefore victimizing me again.\nid leave it alone, no need to bring up old traumas", "YWBTA.  Look man, I was a bully too for a period of my life.  I feel very guilty for what I've done and have considered what you are considering.\n\nBut here's the thing, we have no way of knowing how that will affect the other person.  For all we know it will bring all those shitty memories we made that person have. *We don't have the right* to take that risk with their emotions or mental well-being.\n\nIf he reaches out to you then you can apologize.  But just leave him alone.  And to be quite upfront, you shouldn't even search for him on things like facebook, because facebook will likely then show him you as a suggested friend.

I am 43 years old, and I still have dreams about it. Your apology wouldn't be able to undo the trauma he will have had to live with.\n\nPersonally, i think Calling him to apologize is self serving of you, it will make you feel better, you will feel lighter for getting it off your chest, then trauma dumping your childhood on to  your victim to explain away why you were the way you were.\n \nI understand you feel guilty and want to make things better, but that's a you problem.", "YWBTA. Not for wanting to do it but if you actually did it. It\u2019s selfish. You\u2019d be doing it to soothe your own soul, rather than genuinely having concern for him.

Like you, I had no real idea of the pain and trauma I was causing. I did it because I was miserable with my life. The awful thing is I was in my late teens, early 20s, and I did it in the workplace to what were vulnerable people.\nI desperately want to apologise to those people,  to show them I'm not that person anymore but I know I would be doing it for me. I could try and feel like I was doing the right thing by them, but all I'm doing is serving myself. \nI'm 54, and these parts of my life stab at me all the time, reminding me how shit I was. \n\nA small part of the suffering I caused others is with me everyday. \n\nI earnt this. \n\nYou've earnt yours. Now you get to carry it.", "I would say leave it be, and also (if you\u2019re not already) perhaps talk about this incident with your therapist. You were really young when this happened - and while you have his mothers words in your head, you have no idea how this person feels about you now. It\u2019s possible he hate your guts. It\u2019s also possible that he now has a different perspective about what happens and doesn\u2019t hold blame. Either way, an apology wouldn\u2019t necessarily help him, and if it\u2019s somewhere in the middle an apology may unnecessarily bring up old wounds.\n\nMy cheesy advice?

I was told stuff like \u2018but x is bullied herself\u2019 my whole life, and it\u2019s bs. There is no excuse. You bullied someone and you need to actually take responsibility for that.", "Personally, I would prefer not to hear from my bully at all, unless we would be needing to interact on a regular basis in the future (becoming in-laws, becoming colleagues, something like that).

Not sure if I could do that. So far they've spoken randomly to my best friend in a bar to tell them they realise what an AH they were but no word of apology, more a laugh over how stupid they were for behaving that way and they realise it was wrong. My best friend just stood there and listened, said \"right\" and walked off. They were still mad on my account. So if you do apologise leave out the excuses, leave out your trauma. Just say sorry. If you need to you could say you were so dumb you didn't realise you were being mean but this is about them and you wholeheartedly saying sorry for making them feel the way you did. The reasons why you did it are not their baggage.", "NTA \n\nAs somebody who was severely bullied in high school, at first I think it\u2019d be something that would cause anger. But eventually, I\u2019d appreciate that they didn\u2019t just forget about the trauma and hurt they inflicted upon me. The important thing is to think about why you want to apologize- to make yourself feel better, or to make him feel better? If it\u2019s to make yourself feel better about it, don\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to explain why, but if my bully told me sorry just to get the guilt off himself, I\u2019d be angry. If it\u2019s to extend an olive branch, and let him know that you acknowledge the shitty things you did and said, and that you regret it and hope he\u2019s doing okay now\u2026 I\u2019d say go for it. Don\u2019t self-deprecate  to him, don\u2019t grovel, just say point blank, \u201cHow I treated you was wrong, and shitty, and you didn\u2019t deserve it.

Reach out in a more indirect way, like writing him a letter and sending it. Don't call him or directly jump to meeting him face to face.

I recently had someone who bullied me in middle school apologize to me and though it doesn\u2019t take away past pain it felt good to hear the person acknowledge what they did to me and apologize. I say give it a shot, but also accept whatever they say and know they don\u2019t have to forgive you", "I'm in a bit of a different camp to the prevailing opinion here. Of course, there's no telling how he might take it, how he might feel about it, and whether it'd actually be of any help to him.   \nI had one of my high-school bullies apologize to me after I bumped into him one day, but it very much seemed like it was just for him to absolve himself of his guilt and not really about me.  I didn't know how to react at the time and I still don't know exactly how I feel about it. \"Sorry\" on its own really doesn't do much, and I was already well aware that the way he acted towards me was wrong. So I was just like \"cool whatever don't worry about it\".   \n\n\nI think the difference would've been a bit of empathy. If he'd said \"I know if I were in your position I'd have felt XYZ\" I think it'd have been actually gratifying, validating, and just nice to know that he'd actually grown in that sense. But given what I know of him now along with what his \"apology\" consisted of, that doesn't seem to be the case.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you actually care about the effect your behavior had on him, which is a start - but if you go ahead with it, don't go in with expectations one way or another.

He clearly had some issues relating to other people, and his way of dealing with it was to be a sort of prickly personality. \n\nOne day, my parents got a call from our school principal. This kid\u2019s mom had called the school to complain about the incessant bullying that her son was dealing with, and he pointed me out specifically as the ring leader. She said that he cried everyday before school and asked her not to take him. She also said that he prayed to God everyday that me and the rest of the kids would stop making fun of him.\n\nThe weird part is that I had no idea at all that I was this kid\u2019s bully. I was abused a lot growing up, and I was very sheltered. I was also watching a lot of Saved by the Bell back them. I never really new how to be a person, so I had always patterned myself around tv shows and movies along with whatever my mom wanted me to be like at any given time. The cool guy in the show always makes fun of Screech, and I desperately wanted to be the cool guy. \n\nI pretty much just made fun of the kid all the time just like Zach did to Screech. I guess it made me feel cool and gave me a tiny sliver of power in an otherwise powerless existence. I stopped after the phone call and after realizing what I was really doing, but the damage was already done.\n\nI hit a breaking point with my birth family in my 30s, had a whole mental breakdown, and eventually started some pretty intense trauma therapy (EMDR + CBT + IFS) and have been going weekly without fail for 5+ years. \n\nI understand things a lot better now. I have been NC with my toxic family for years, and I am a much different person than I was back then. I\u2019m actually very chill, quite nerdy, and I spend a lot of my time and energy trying to help kids who are in similar tough situations.\n\nI think about this kid a lot, about what it was like for him dealing with that kind of anxiety and ridicule everyday. I still to this day can\u2019t believe I did what I did.\n\nOn a whim, I googled his name today and was surprised to find his address and phone number pretty quickly. I\u2019m not on social media, and I guess I never thought it would be so easy to find this guy\u2019s info.\n\nIf you were him, would you be pissed if your old bully called you to apologize and explain himself? Or would it be a positive thing for you? He might just tell me to fuck off and die, but if that is cathartic for him then I\u2019ll take it.

It was... awkward. I don't hate them, I'm not angry at them - I've long since forgiven all of them on the grounds that we were all kids at the time! - but that doesn't mean I want to chit-chat about it.

If you want to receive a little pat on the back that it wasn't that bad and this guy forgives you, I don't think  that the conversation would go that way, as he is not obliged in any way to forgive you for things you put him through (regardless of your personal circumstances at the time). I.e. if you are trying to reach out for him for YOURSELF as opposed to truly apologising to him and explaining that it wasn't his fault that you were f\\*cked up then YWBTA.\n\nHowever, I agree with other commenters here that writing a letter which gives him time to digest what you are saying and does not place any onus on him to respond, only apologising for what you put him through, would make you NTA imo.

It should be a letter or email type thing, not just turning up at his door or ringing him.\n\nIf you're doing it for him then go for it, but if you're doing it to make yourself feel better, just let him move on - and he likely has already and has put it behind him. Also, don't expect a reply and if he does reply, don't expect it to be positive. He may just vent at you and say you're awful and selfish - if that's going to affect your MH and recovery, just leave the entire thing. I understand wanting to apologise, but sometimes the past is best left in the past. I also think a lot of people here forget that kids do stupid shit they wouldn't do as an adult and look at these things with their current adult brain and not think about how a kid would perceive the world around them and not realise something about it was wrong and so would then repeat that behaviour externally too.

I have had one of them reach out (almost 10+ years ago, now). It was awkward, and difficult to understand in the moment.

I would say YWNBTA. I would say that if you do this, you must spend some time thinking on your execution, as that will go a long way.\n\nThe way I see it: in the best case scenario you both have become self-actualized adults. You reach out, apologize, and you both get some closure to dark times. You both heal wounds that you don't feel anymore. You get to atone while he has some faith in humanity restored, from a place that it was most depleted. In the worst 'good' scenario, you help him move along his own journey if he's still fighting those demons. The absolute worst case scenario is likely that he tells you to get bent.

Maybe feel the vibe if you wanna do more apology and not explain anymore.", "I agree with you about the self-soothing part. That\u2019s on me 100%. I have to deal with the regret and shame, and I don\u2019t want his help.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a defensive OP, here\u2019s my reason, and then I\u2019ll shutup and let people say what they want to say.\n\nTrigger Warning\n\n>!One of the best parts of my therapy has been realizing that my parents did what they did to me back then because of what was wrong with them and not because something was wrong with me. That might seem obvious from the outside, but it wasn\u2019t for me. For me, it was constant, every day, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse for about 15 years. That kind of time and repetition makes you really believe the things that they say, and I did.!<\n\n>!It\u2019s just now that I am realizing that I wasn\u2019t a stupid kid, I wasn\u2019t a r-word kid with no common sense, I wasn\u2019t a \u201csexy\u201d kid who tempted my mom and my aunts, I wasn\u2019t a dysfunctional kid, I wasn\u2019t a faot or a puy, I wasn\u2019t a fat kid who needed to suck in my tummy all the time, I wasn\u2019t any of those things. It was all them projecting onto me. Being able to finally start un-believing these things after all these years has made me finally stop fantasizing about suicide. It\u2019s incredible.!<\n\n>!And now I worry that this kid still believes the things we said about him, that I said about him, repeatedly for a whole school year. It kills me to think that he might actually think I was right. I so badly want to tell him that he is none of those things and that it was all my fault. I don\u2019t want him carrying that around, because none of it is true. My hope would be that me telling him that it was all me and not him, that that might help him to un-believe bad things he might believe about himself. I don\u2019t plan on trauma dumping on him or justifying myself even asking for forgiveness that I don\u2019t deserve. I just don\u2019t want him to believe those bad things about himself. /rant!<\n\ndeleted the previous reply due to messing up the spoiler tags", "[deleted]", "God damn this is deep.", "Plus you must\u2019ve really hurt this kid if they were crying *every morning* before school.", "Yep, write and apologise.

If he wants to know anything more from you he can reply.", ">Also Jesus Christ the modern world is scary.\n\nPhonebooks have been a thing since the mid-1800s and growing up, they used to have everyone's name, number, and address (unless you opted out.)", "This. Text, email, even a letter would all be better than a call. That way, he can just completely ignore you, if he doesn't want to deal with it anymore or take the time to consider how he feels about you reaching out. Calling him, out of the blue, would just put him on the spot, in my opinion.", "Fair points all around, and I deserve it. It was 100% my decision, and I am to blame. I had to leave out some paragraphs that might give more info. I kept coming in over the character limit. \n\nThe tv show thing was more explaining why I was surprised by the revelation, not to eschew blame. I was a major dick, and he didn\u2019t deserve it regardless of what I was going through at home no matter how bad it was.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to boast either. I\u2019m not a good person. I\u2019ve learned a lot about what made me that way and I try to use that info for good now. But that doesn\u2019t make me good. It doesn\u2019t erase what I did. I fucked up someone\u2019s childhood. I can\u2019t erase that. \n\nAnd you\u2019re right about me wanting to feel better. I mainly made this post for that reason. I agonize about it often, and I don\u2019t want to do it if it would be just about me and wouldn\u2019t benefit him at all.", "I think I would mainly want to say sorry, that he didn\u2019t deserve it, and that there is nothing wrong with him but something wrong with me that made me lash out.

But I agree that he shouldn\u2019t reach out", "Exactly. It\u2019s also just so transparently done for the bully\u2019s benefit, to assuage their guilt. And so unbelievably self-important too. The more I think about it the more breathtaking it is.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry for what you went through.", ">I would also feel unsafe if one of them knew my contact information\n\nSame. I don't understand people commenting saying that OP should mail a letter. That would creep me out, and it feels suspect.\n\nMy vote is to leave the guy alone.

Like you said you\u2019re not the same guy you were back then and you\u2019re trying to change. Our childhood and teenage years have a massive impact on our actions during that time. At that point we have such a limited sense of right and wrong if our environment at the time isn\u2019t good; then having an affect on our peers and ppl similar to our age. \nI\u2019m not excusing what you did in the past, but I can see why your behaviour was like that. \nBut there\u2019s a saying, just because someone\u2019s going through something or someone\u2019s hurt you doesn\u2019t give you the right or the free pass to become like your oppressor.. \nI hope you see where I am coming from. \nWish you all the luck in your healing journey.\nAnd remember to be okay with him not accepting, not at least you tried.", "Well you still needed to already know what city someone was in you couldn't just find them from the other side of the world.\n\nAlso inevitably I don't really know what your point is.

I don't get the yta comments because I didn't agree with them and didn't feel like you came off as wanting to make yourself feel better.

This is what I was looking for, and you\u2019ve made a really good point. \n\nYes, it would have helped a lot if they actually admitted it, apologized, and tried to change, but it would still have taken years to work through in therapy regardless. \n\nI have no way of knowing where he is at or what kind of support system he has or if he is at a place where he even wants to deal with it.
