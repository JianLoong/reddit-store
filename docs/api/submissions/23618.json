He clearly had some issues relating to other people, and his way of dealing with it was to be a sort of prickly personality. \n\nOne day, my parents got a call from our school principal. This kid\u2019s mom had called the school to complain about the incessant bullying that her son was dealing with, and he pointed me out specifically as the ring leader. She said that he cried everyday before school and asked her not to take him. She also said that he prayed to God everyday that me and the rest of the kids would stop making fun of him.\n\nThe weird part is that I had no idea at all that I was this kid\u2019s bully. I was abused a lot growing up, and I was very sheltered. I was also watching a lot of Saved by the Bell back them. I never really new how to be a person, so I had always patterned myself around tv shows and movies along with whatever my mom wanted me to be like at any given time. The cool guy in the show always makes fun of Screech, and I desperately wanted to be the cool guy. \n\nI pretty much just made fun of the kid all the time just like Zach did to Screech. I guess it made me feel cool and gave me a tiny sliver of power in an otherwise powerless existence. I stopped after the phone call and after realizing what I was really doing, but the damage was already done.\n\nI hit a breaking point with my birth family in my 30s, had a whole mental breakdown, and eventually started some pretty intense trauma therapy (EMDR + CBT + IFS) and have been going weekly without fail for 5+ years. \n\nI understand things a lot better now. I have been NC with my toxic family for years, and I am a much different person than I was back then. I\u2019m actually very chill, quite nerdy, and I spend a lot of my time and energy trying to help kids who are in similar tough situations.\n\nI think about this kid a lot, about what it was like for him dealing with that kind of anxiety and ridicule everyday. I still to this day can\u2019t believe I did what I did.\n\nOn a whim, I googled his name today and was surprised to find his address and phone number pretty quickly. I\u2019m not on social media, and I guess I never thought it would be so easy to find this guy\u2019s info.\n\nIf you were him, would you be pissed if your old bully called you to apologize and explain himself? Or would it be a positive thing for you? He might just tell me to fuck off and die, but if that is cathartic for him then I\u2019ll take it.

If you end up indeed doing something I would suggest some written form rather than call/visit. Either email or letter and make sure it is known it's from you in the first place. In case he is not okay with you contacting him that way he can just choose to ignore it without reading - he has an absolute right to do so... he could also take his time reading and thinking of what he wants to do next etc.. .If you suddenly call/visit him you would give him no choice but to interact with you to some degree and since you are no therapy rookie you should know the best why that's not a nice thing to do.", "Another poster put it quite eloquently..

Personally - i don't think an apology or explanation would fix a messed up childhood - however - you can ask yourself:  \nWould it help if your mum apologized? Would it help if she explains why she did it?\n\nSeeing yo go no contact with your family - i'd kinda expect the answer to be no... But - that's just my guess.", "~~N-A-H~~. YWBTA. I'm 40s and was briefly bullied by two people in high school. One who's name I can't recall I last saw in my 20s when I returned home for my wedding and he was bussing the table. The other who's name I know I presume is either in prison or dead. If they reached out and apologized? I mean, I'd think it was cool that they turned their lives around. I'd say a kind word or two? It probably matters more to you than to them. Hope it goes well!\n\nETA - After not looking up the fellow in 28 years, I finally looked up my bully for one year. My freshman year he was a junior who literally threw a younger kid out a window for standing up to him. I see two burglary felonies, then a deadbeat dad to 3 kids, but then 16yrs ago got an art degree, and he now does truck rolls for Comcast. Villains deserve worse. :p\n\nOn second thought, I'd prefer not to hear from them, especially if their goal was to unburden their conscience. If they were offering financial restitution, maybe.", "i honestly think it would piss me off,\ni see where you\u2019re coming from and it feels like your intentions are genuine,\nbut if it were me in his shoes, i think id see it as you using me to make yourself feel better, therefore victimizing me again.\nid leave it alone, no need to bring up old traumas", "YWBTA.  Look man, I was a bully too for a period of my life.  I feel very guilty for what I've done and have considered what you are considering.\n\nBut here's the thing, we have no way of knowing how that will affect the other person.  For all we know it will bring all those shitty memories we made that person have. *We don't have the right* to take that risk with their emotions or mental well-being.\n\nIf he reaches out to you then you can apologize.  But just leave him alone.  And to be quite upfront, you shouldn't even search for him on things like facebook, because facebook will likely then show him you as a suggested friend.  And he probably just wants to forget about that entire period of his life.", "[deleted]", "\nThe thing is, if you call him to apologize, he might be happy about it, or he might not want all those old memories dragged back up to the forefront.\n\nWhen you are bullied like that, you never fully recover from it. I am 43 years old, and I still have dreams about it. Your apology wouldn't be able to undo the trauma he will have had to live with.\n\nPersonally, i think Calling him to apologize is self serving of you, it will make you feel better, you will feel lighter for getting it off your chest, then trauma dumping your childhood on to  your victim to explain away why you were the way you were.\n \nI understand you feel guilty and want to make things better, but that's a you problem.", "YWBTA. Not for wanting to do it but if you actually did it. It\u2019s selfish. You\u2019d be doing it to soothe your own soul, rather than genuinely having concern for him.

Like you, I had no real idea of the pain and trauma I was causing. I did it because I was miserable with my life. The awful thing is I was in my late teens, early 20s, and I did it in the workplace to what were vulnerable people.\nI desperately want to apologise to those people,  to show them I'm not that person anymore but I know I would be doing it for me. I could try and feel like I was doing the right thing by them, but all I'm doing is serving myself. \nI'm 54, and these parts of my life stab at me all the time, reminding me how shit I was. \n\nA small part of the suffering I caused others is with me everyday. \n\nI earnt this. \n\nYou've earnt yours. Now you get to carry it.", "I would say leave it be, and also (if you\u2019re not already) perhaps talk about this incident with your therapist. You were really young when this happened - and while you have his mothers words in your head, you have no idea how this person feels about you now. It\u2019s possible he hate your guts. It\u2019s also possible that he now has a different perspective about what happens and doesn\u2019t hold blame. Either way, an apology wouldn\u2019t necessarily help him, and if it\u2019s somewhere in the middle an apology may unnecessarily bring up old wounds.\n\nMy cheesy advice?

I was told stuff like \u2018but x is bullied herself\u2019 my whole life, and it\u2019s bs. There is no excuse. You bullied someone and you need to actually take responsibility for that.", "Personally, I would prefer not to hear from my bully at all, unless we would be needing to interact on a regular basis in the future (becoming in-laws, becoming colleagues, something like that). If not, I\u2019d not want to revisit that time.", "NTA If my high school bully contacted me with a proper apology, not excuses... I'd be glad to hear it. However, don't expect a reply. Not sure if I could do that. So far they've spoken randomly to my best friend in a bar to tell them they realise what an AH they were but no word of apology, more a laugh over how stupid they were for behaving that way and they realise it was wrong. My best friend just stood there and listened, said \"right\" and walked off. They were still mad on my account. So if you do apologise leave out the excuses, leave out your trauma. Just say sorry. If you need to you could say you were so dumb you didn't realise you were being mean but this is about them and you wholeheartedly saying sorry for making them feel the way you did. The reasons why you did it are not their baggage.", "NTA \n\nAs somebody who was severely bullied in high school, at first I think it\u2019d be something that would cause anger. But eventually, I\u2019d appreciate that they didn\u2019t just forget about the trauma and hurt they inflicted upon me. The important thing is to think about why you want to apologize- to make yourself feel better, or to make him feel better? If it\u2019s to make yourself feel better about it, don\u2019t. It\u2019s hard to explain why, but if my bully told me sorry just to get the guilt off himself, I\u2019d be angry. If it\u2019s to extend an olive branch, and let him know that you acknowledge the shitty things you did and said, and that you regret it and hope he\u2019s doing okay now\u2026 I\u2019d say go for it. Don\u2019t self-deprecate  to him, don\u2019t grovel, just say point blank, \u201cHow I treated you was wrong, and shitty, and you didn\u2019t deserve it.

Reach out in a more indirect way, like writing him a letter and sending it. Don't call him or directly jump to meeting him face to face.

You don't want to open any cans of worms that this guy has sealed shut", "Hard to say as this it depends on the person. I recently had someone who bullied me in middle school apologize to me and though it doesn\u2019t take away past pain it felt good to hear the person acknowledge what they did to me and apologize. I say give it a shot, but also accept whatever they say and know they don\u2019t have to forgive you", "I'm in a bit of a different camp to the prevailing opinion here. Of course, there's no telling how he might take it, how he might feel about it, and whether it'd actually be of any help to him.   \nI had one of my high-school bullies apologize to me after I bumped into him one day, but it very much seemed like it was just for him to absolve himself of his guilt and not really about me.  I didn't know how to react at the time and I still don't know exactly how I feel about it. \"Sorry\" on its own really doesn't do much, and I was already well aware that the way he acted towards me was wrong. So I was just like \"cool whatever don't worry about it\".   \n\n\nI think the difference would've been a bit of empathy. If he'd said \"I know if I were in your position I'd have felt XYZ\" I think it'd have been actually gratifying, validating, and just nice to know that he'd actually grown in that sense. But given what I know of him now along with what his \"apology\" consisted of, that doesn't seem to be the case.  \n\n\nIt sounds like you actually care about the effect your behavior had on him, which is a start - but if you go ahead with it, don't go in with expectations one way or another.

He clearly had some issues relating to other people, and his way of dealing with it was to be a sort of prickly personality. \n\nOne day, my parents got a call from our school principal. This kid\u2019s mom had called the school to complain about the incessant bullying that her son was dealing with, and he pointed me out specifically as the ring leader. She said that he cried everyday before school and asked her not to take him. She also said that he prayed to God everyday that me and the rest of the kids would stop making fun of him.\n\nThe weird part is that I had no idea at all that I was this kid\u2019s bully. I was abused a lot growing up, and I was very sheltered. I was also watching a lot of Saved by the Bell back them. I never really new how to be a person, so I had always patterned myself around tv shows and movies along with whatever my mom wanted me to be like at any given time. The cool guy in the show always makes fun of Screech, and I desperately wanted to be the cool guy. \n\nI pretty much just made fun of the kid all the time just like Zach did to Screech. I guess it made me feel cool and gave me a tiny sliver of power in an otherwise powerless existence. I stopped after the phone call and after realizing what I was really doing, but the damage was already done.\n\nI hit a breaking point with my birth family in my 30s, had a whole mental breakdown, and eventually started some pretty intense trauma therapy (EMDR + CBT + IFS) and have been going weekly without fail for 5+ years. \n\nI understand things a lot better now. I have been NC with my toxic family for years, and I am a much different person than I was back then. I\u2019m actually very chill, quite nerdy, and I spend a lot of my time and energy trying to help kids who are in similar tough situations.\n\nI think about this kid a lot, about what it was like for him dealing with that kind of anxiety and ridicule everyday. I still to this day can\u2019t believe I did what I did.\n\nOn a whim, I googled his name today and was surprised to find his address and phone number pretty quickly. I\u2019m not on social media, and I guess I never thought it would be so easy to find this guy\u2019s info.\n\nIf you were him, would you be pissed if your old bully called you to apologize and explain himself? Or would it be a positive thing for you? He might just tell me to fuck off and die, but if that is cathartic for him then I\u2019ll take it.

It was... awkward. I don't hate them, I'm not angry at them - I've long since forgiven all of them on the grounds that we were all kids at the time! - but that doesn't mean I want to chit-chat about it.

If you want to receive a little pat on the back that it wasn't that bad and this guy forgives you, I don't think  that the conversation would go that way, as he is not obliged in any way to forgive you for things you put him through (regardless of your personal circumstances at the time). I.e. if you are trying to reach out for him for YOURSELF as opposed to truly apologising to him and explaining that it wasn't his fault that you were f\\*cked up then YWBTA.\n\nHowever, I agree with other commenters here that writing a letter which gives him time to digest what you are saying and does not place any onus on him to respond, only apologising for what you put him through, would make you NTA imo.

It should be a letter or email type thing, not just turning up at his door or ringing him.\n\nIf you're doing it for him then go for it, but if you're doing it to make yourself feel better, just let him move on - and he likely has already and has put it behind him. Also, don't expect a reply and if he does reply, don't expect it to be positive. He may just vent at you and say you're awful and selfish - if that's going to affect your MH and recovery, just leave the entire thing. I understand wanting to apologise, but sometimes the past is best left in the past. I also think a lot of people here forget that kids do stupid shit they wouldn't do as an adult and look at these things with their current adult brain and not think about how a kid would perceive the world around them and not realise something about it was wrong and so would then repeat that behaviour externally too.

I have had one of them reach out (almost 10+ years ago, now). It was awkward, and difficult to understand in the moment.

I would say YWNBTA. I would say that if you do this, you must spend some time thinking on your execution, as that will go a long way.\n\nThe way I see it: in the best case scenario you both have become self-actualized adults. You reach out, apologize, and you both get some closure to dark times. You both heal wounds that you don't feel anymore. You get to atone while he has some faith in humanity restored, from a place that it was most depleted. In the worst 'good' scenario, you help him move along his own journey if he's still fighting those demons. The absolute worst case scenario is likely that he tells you to get bent.

That might seem obvious from the outside, but it wasn\u2019t for me. For me, it was constant, every day, verbal, physical, and sexual abuse for about 15 years. That kind of time and repetition makes you really believe the things that they say, and I did.!<\n\n>!It\u2019s just now that I am realizing that I wasn\u2019t a stupid kid, I wasn\u2019t a r-word kid with no common sense, I wasn\u2019t a \u201csexy\u201d kid who tempted my mom and my aunts, I wasn\u2019t a dysfunctional kid, I wasn\u2019t a faot or a puy, I wasn\u2019t a fat kid who needed to suck in my tummy all the time, I wasn\u2019t any of those things. It was all them projecting onto me. Being able to finally start un-believing these things after all these years has made me finally stop fantasizing about suicide. It\u2019s incredible.!<\n\n>!And now I worry that this kid still believes the things we said about him, that I said about him, repeatedly for a whole school year. It kills me to think that he might actually think I was right. I so badly want to tell him that he is none of those things and that it was all my fault. I don\u2019t want him carrying that around, because none of it is true. My hope would be that me telling him that it was all me and not him, that that might help him to un-believe bad things he might believe about himself. I don\u2019t plan on trauma dumping on him or justifying myself even asking for forgiveness that I don\u2019t deserve.

If you are religious or you know the person in question is religious maybe pray for their healing and good things in their future?         \nI wouldn\u2019t say you are 100% an arsehole for this because there are nuances but for the sake of this community I\u2019d say YTA.", "I think before you reach out to this person you should figure out how to use your experiences to help prevent bullying for others.

Don\u2019t just contact someone, ask them to relive the way you helped make them feel, and hope that it might be as healing for them as it would be for you\n\nI think you should seriously consider having  a third party contact this person to let them know you\u2019d like to apologize and ask if they would be interested in receiving that and, if so, how they would want to receive that communication- respect their privacy and their wishes.  Otherwise its about you again and YTA.", "A few years ago, a former bully of mine reached out to me with a friendship request on fb - the message was a friendly \u201cHi! It\u2019s been so long. Can\u2019t wait to catch up.\u201d I was floored. Actually felt a little sick to my stomach. \n\nIn middle school, this person had regularly told me I was too fat for certain outfits, had used social exclusion, and had turned former friends against me. I ended up developing an eating disorder, nearly dropped out of high school, and it took me until university to see myself as someone people might want to be friends with.\n\nIt took me a few days, but I eventually wrote back to this person, and explained I was turning down the fb request and why. I also said I would appreciate it if they did not reply.\n\nOf course, the person replied. Told me about their toxic family, etc\u2026 There is a part of me that can sympathize, it sounded awful. But, it didn\u2019t feel like an apology. Even just hearing from the person made me feel awful. I never replied to the second message.\n\nThe time to apologize was when you were informed about the effect your actions were having on the kid (at least you stopped, but that\u2019s kind of the minimum.) Obviously, if you were to bump into him somehow, an acknowledgment and an apology would be appropriate ( don\u2019t even try to provide an explanation - just \u201cI am sorry I was so awful to you\u201d will suffice.) \n\nBut if you track him down, insert yourself into his life, offer an apology, and then explain that you were going through things, were trying to imitate a character from a tv show, and that you weren\u2019t trying to bully him, just going more for a laugh track kind of thing - then yeah YWBTA", "If I was the bullied, I would accept the apology and be happy with it.

How he responds, or even IF he responds at all, is entirely up to him. \n\nAlso, I second the comments saying calling his phone or writing to his home address will come off as creepy and stalkerish.

I'm 35 now, and when I go back home the bullies will come up to apologise if they see me. \n\nI spent years blaming myself and being miserable, angry and hating them. Long after school. It took years to let go of that anger, even longer to forgive (I work hard not to be bitter, but if I'm honest I don't think I have forgiven.)\n\nWhen they apologise all I feel is that rage and misery again. I then have to go through the whole process again.\n\nEvery time it happens it just feels as though it's for their benefit. I don't care if they're better now. What difference does that make to me?

Way to go for not being a prick anymore. End the cycle and be a better person for yourself. Bye.\n\nNo, \"I'm sorry\" will ever take away the actions they've done and made me do to myself. Knowing what I do now about my bully, her mom lost the house after her dad died and had to move to the affordable housing apartments. This took a toll on her status as a popular girl since she didn't come from money anymore people didn't really want to hang out with her. She started being mean and making people laugh and that's what got people to like her again. Yeah let's gang up on the girl who has blue green and purple hair. I can understand what she went through but it doesn't excuse the fact that my best friend went through it and she didn't do that to people.  Rant over.\n\nCongrats on making yourself a better person and working through your hard times.", "Whatever you do, don\u2019t reach out via his home address. I would be so freaked out if a former bully knew where I lived. I thought about this as well with someone I wasn\u2019t very kind to and just try to send positive thoughts their way. You could reach out to them via Facebook and make the note about them\u2026 how will this note benefit them? You could end the note in a way like if they ever need anything don\u2019t be afraid to reach out that you want to make things right", "I was bullied very very badly all the way through school and it affected me deeply. Years later after I\u2019d reached a relatively good place at last, a girl who had stood by and watched it happen reached out to me via social media to apologise (for saying and doing nothing). I took it in the spirit in which it was offered: graciously. And accepted her apology. \n\nThere was another girl who had actually done a huge amount of the bullying and she and I also chatted years later. But her apology wasn\u2019t really about saying sorry. She just made excuses for herself and there was no insight into her behaviour or sincere acknowledgment of the hurt she\u2019d caused. I would have accepted her apology if she\u2019d actually made one. \n\nSo I would say if you\u2019re going to say sorry, be sincere about it.

There were a lot of bullies, and not one ever did.  Back then, I began to lash out and bullied a kid.  I found him on FB, and sent him an apology private message.  He and I are on good terms now.  What\u2019s done is done regarding my past bullies but with therapy and medication, I was eventually able to move on build a life for myself.  I really just wish that, regarding those who changed, they could have reached out so we could have become friends.  I did reach out to them, but none of them were interested in becoming friends.  Maybe they changed among their circle?  Maybe it has to do with the fact that we had all gone to Yeshiva (Jewish school) together, and I converted to Catholicism (very taboo in Jewish communities)?", "If you ever organically run into him again, then yes apologise with no excuses. Otherwise, do not reach out to him.", "I was bullied in school, to the point I wanted to commit suicide at one point. Once school was done, I came across a few of my bullies a few years later (separately), and each of them seemed to have matured. So personally, I forgave everyone inside and realised the way people are in school are not who they necessarily are as a person, but that everyone has their own pressures growing up. (Of course some people grow up to be bullies too.)\n\nThat\u2019s just my story though. Other people never forgive their bullies because of what they\u2019ve been through, and that\u2019s okay too - only they know what they\u2019ve been through as victims. I have had changes in my life and to the way I react in social settings because of school bullying, but I\u2019m ok. Other people are not ok.\n\nThing is, everyone is different. You\u2019ll get many responses here with varied reasonings why you should or shouldn\u2019t reach out.

Others have moved on emotionally and don\u2019t want the past brought up. For others it could be even a massive life change for the positive to finally be validated with an apology.\n\nI would personally lean towards doing it, as long as you\u2019re sensitive in the way you approach it, with a genuine apology. I have had people apologise for taking things out on me by basically saying, \u201cYou\u2019re just such an easy target,\u201d which essentially has felt like blaming me for being gentle, rather than taking actual responsibility for themselves.

However, Reddit is a cesspool and 99% of the time gives terrible advice.  I\u2019d discuss it with your therapist, he or she probably can see both perspectives quite clearly.  I do know that in a 12 step program they require you to humbly make amends so I would lean on the side of a letter.  You\u2019re not putting anyone on the spot and you\u2019re giving him the option to reach out if he wishes.  I am empathetic to your situation, though.  Most bullies have been abused and damaged in some way and are inappropriately trying to take back some control.  It\u2019s not a great way to do it but you were a child.  Talk to your therapist.

I say leave him alone", "I think it would land as a lot more about you than him to be honest.", "To apologize and listen to him might be something he is willing to do. However, if you are going to minimize your bullying by giving a list of excuses, that is just a major asshole move.

You made his life hell and he has every right to go NC with you.\n\nHe does not have to care at all about your struggles and what you went through.", "If I heard from someone who bullied me out of the blue, I'd make it my absolute mission to destroy them.

I've found there are two main types of apologizing bullies: the ones that expect forgiveness, and the ones that genuinely only want for me to heal. I appreciate the later, but always send the former on a guilt trip. \n\nIf I were in your position, I would definitely try to apologize, but making very explicit that you do not want (nor deserve) forgiveness. It's up to the person you bullied to decide whether or not they wish to forgive you, but I think it would benefit them to know you've been feeling guilty all these years. Please do NOT explain the reasons why you bullied them, they don't care. They probably had a lot going on in their lives as well but they still made the conscious choice of not bullying anyone. \n\nI think an apology helps enormously with healing and also with taking the blame out of the person who was bullied. I personally struggled a lot thinking it was my fault I was bullied, if only I had been more normal/nice/popular/whatever. I believe apologizing to the person you hurt can help them get over the pain you caused and heal better. \n\nHowever, do not be surprised if the person tells you to F-off. An apology doesn't fix decades of pain, you must be aware of that. If they choose to ignore you or tell you off, you must accept it and move on. This apology is not for your benefit, it's for theirs. \n\nIn any case, as a formerly bullied person, I am happy to learn you are working on yourself in therapy and are aware of the pain you caused someone else. I'm also somehow happy you've struggled longly with this. Not because I wish you pain per se, but because I think it's only fair you feel a fraction of the pain you caused to thay guy. You probably were not the only person bullying him at the time, and it's a miracle that guy is still alive and was able to continue moving forward with his life. Many people who suffer bullying do not reach adulthood. It may seem a kids' game, but it's not, people die because of this. Bear that in mind when apologizing.", "I was heavily bullied by someone in middle school.

She had RSVP'd yes, but several people reached out to her on social media and told her that I wasn't going because of her, and she decided not to go, I guess because she didn't want anymore fallout or taking responsibility for her actions. From what I hear, she remained the same bully even in her 40's.  However, someone I was initially friends with joined this girl's clique, also bullied me, and when there was trouble, they sold her down the river.

You never deserved the abuse you got - it was your family who was the problem. It was the same thing with my mom - I realized I wasn\u2019t a selfish, stupid, c*nt. She was a broken old lady who refused to look inward because it was too scary - in other words, *she* is the problem. \n\nIf your old schoolmate has been through therapy, then they will have realized this too - *he* wasn\u2019t the problem. You were. In that scenario, a letter from you confirming this may provide some closure for him or even help him have a little more faith in the world because it\u2019ll show him that people *are* capable of change (someone who is actively abusive is not able to admit fault, so you clearly *have* changed a lot). \n\nHowever.

First he states he had \u201cno idea\u201d he was the kid\u2019s bully but then goes on to say he \u201cpretty much just made fun of the kid all the time\u201d like Zack did to Screech on Saved by the Bell. Sounds like he knew exactly what he was doing.", "Because his motives are shady", "Well knowing you\u2019ve made someone else feel better about something is always going to make you feel better. It\u2019s impossible not to. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, you have to feel bad for hurting someone to be able to be moved enough to apologise & make it up to them, & then that obviously turns into feeling better. That\u2019s literally how human feelings work, there\u2019s no way around it. I\u2019m baffled by this notion people are pushing in these kind of posts that apologising to someone is selfish if it makes you feel better too. Obviously handle it sensitively but apologising sincerely to someone is never a bad thing just because it makes you feel better. \n\nIt\u2019s like saying no good deed is completely selfless because it will always make you feel better. Like when Phoebe tries to find something in Friends but can\u2019t.", "I'd also suggest that it sounds like you're protecting onto him. You don't know him and never really did. You cant know where he is on his healing journey and I believe that you want to help him and that this isn't JUST about soothing your own shame. But you're putting your own feelings about what happened to you onto him. You may be right, but you may he wrong. \n\nI had a bully whose abuse is the origin of my suicidal ideation. He found Jesus and became a great person. I still rejecting his kindness and would uave rejected an apology. Who he is now does not negate who he was then for me because I carry around intense trauma from who he was then. He cannot apologize that away. I know I was not deserving of his abuse. I know I am a worthwhile and wonderful person. I do not need someone who tormented me to tell me that and would find it deeply insulting if he were to try and give me that validation after being the one to rip it away. \n\nAll that said, I am sorry that you went through what you did. You are not a bad person after the work you uave done and you were a traumatized child navigating the world the best you knew how. You've done some incredible work. \n\nPlease leave this guy alone and go through this with your therapists. There may be something to the intense desire to right the wrong that ties into something about you that you need to work through or on rather than involving this person. \n\n:)", "I think your heart is in the right place and a sincere apology could be helpful for him as well as you.  But as you just pointed out, you don't know for sure how he'll react.  \n\nIf you found him on social media, perhaps you could contact a friend or family member of his through email.  They might be able to guide you to the answer that would be right for him.", "As someone else said, you might be projecting your previous desires onto this person you have bullied. \n\nAs you've said, you have no idea where he is at, or what his support network is like. You also don't know if he even wants an apology.\n\nAnd so I'm going to project all over you, or, as I like to call it, reframe it from a different perspective.\n\nI have been bullied and abused, both as an adult and as a child. I've also done a shit tonne of work to get where I am today.\n\n* Would I like a sincere apology from my abusers? Yes. \n* Would I trust that apology to actually be sincere? Definitely not.\n* If they contacted me out of the blue (no matter what their intentions), would it have a detrimental effect on the work I've done to get to this point? Hell yes.\n\nAs I've said to my therapist, these people cannot win in this game. I want the apology, but I would not trust it, and them making contact would not be beneficial for me. I want to be left alone, and not getting the apology is part of that.\n\nYou're in that position - you probably won't get what you want, and he won't get what you think he might want, because you simply don't know.\n\nI understand that you've done a lot of work, and that is of great credit to you. Keep going with your journey. \n\nBut it feels like this guy you were a bully to in school is out of your sphere of influence at this point in time, so all you can do is keep your side of the street clean without trying to clean up his uninvited. I'll stop mixing analogies now.", "It may have helped if they\u2019d taken accountability sure, but what if you\u2019d already gone no contact and they had no idea where you lived or how to contact you, and then suddenly managed to get ahold of your contact information or address and surprised you with that apology by popping up when you were least expecting it in a place where you felt safe? You have no reason to have this dude\u2019s contact information. How terrifying and violating do you think it would feel to find out someone that hurled abuse at you now knows where you live? When you haven\u2019t had contact with them in years, maybe even relocated with the idea of getting away from them? Hell if someone I had a *good* relationship with suddenly knew where I lived without me telling them I\u2019d be terrified.", "This isn\u2019t meant to kick you in the balls, because you don\u2019t deserve what you have been through. But the thing is, us bullied kids have lived the rest of our lives fully aware that we weren\u2019t the problem. Have you thought about some sort of \u2018give back\u2019 like giving talks in schools about how you treated him and how you feel about it now? It could make other bullies think, maybe.", "I\u2019m surprised at most of the replies you\u2019ve received here. \n\nI think if you were to apologise and to explain that you were also a kid suffering it would be a lovely thing to do. Your motives are clear and you\u2019ve articulated yourself very well here, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d do the same in a letter if you sent it. You\u2019re remorseful and you want to make amends. \n\nYou might be opening up old wounds but you might also be helping someone who is struggling. If therapy has taught me anything it\u2019s that discussing our issues is almost always a good thing. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had such a shitty childhood. That\u2019s not fair for anyone to have to go through.", "Yeah lol. You can kinda tell they're projecting really hard onto the person OP bullied.", "The issue is it really wasn't. We are all desensitized to it and screech really wanted to desperately be cool but look at how long he was really on the outside. Much of the teasing would be very hurtful in reality.", "Zack was a bully. Screech was his friend to give him someone to make fun of and look better beside. Like, if he was a real person, his daddy would\u2019ve paid to get him out of at least three pregnancies and four rape cases before he was out of college.", "I did the same thing, haha. \"If you're looking for absolution, keep looking. You're not getting it from me.\" Although probably less eloquently put because they put me on the spot.", "Yeah, if my old bully did this I would tell him to get fucked and I'm not here to tell him something is alright when it was not and isn't.", "\"Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies from it.\"  Responding this way sounds like your way of trying to bully your bully.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm no fan of bullies, I was bullied in school also.  But I made the decision to not let their actions change the person I am.", "Imagine someone jumped you on the street, beat the shit out of you, and then you never saw them again. Twenty years later, you hear a knock at the door and it's that person, there to apologize.\n\nIf you'd been battered but not seriously injured, at *best* this would be weird and suspicious. It happened so long ago that you'd long since put it behind you, but here's this person, and for all you know he's just trying to lower your guard enough to beat the shit out of you again.\n\nIf there were more permanent damage - let's say something that landed you in a wheelchair for life - your feelings would probably be a lot more bitter and angry.\n\nFor you, what's the positive result here? Again, in the best of circumstances, they're being sincere and you recognize that and accept their apology and... Then what? You have closure? You didn't need closure before they showed up. The whole interaction was net zero.", "Ah but you see OP had a difficult home and OP wanted to be cool and thought copying the actions of a TV character was the way to be cool and OP is totally a better person now wh9 definitely stopped bullying this kid the second anyone told OP the kid was crying every fucking day. OP is a narcissistic cocksponge who thinks apologies years later will do anything positive at all. OP leave your victim alone. The time for apologies has passed. Find your own way to cope with being a bully. Dont make your bullshit his problem again.", "But Zack and screech were friends, so it's fine! /S", "That\u2019s part of the trauma, right? We were just minding our own business, enjoying whatever we enjoyed, doing our best to be a good kid/student/friend, and bullies decide that we are somehow wrong. It\u2019s bewildering. And it\u2019s only when we\u2019re more mature that we see that the bullying is about the bully \u2014 not about the victim.", "It's weird how \"controversial\" this opinion is because I actually got an apology from my bully and I appreciated it. There wasn't an explanation and I actually would have liked to know why she behaved as she did.", "Bah haha yes\u2026 lol my bad.", "Scary that he looked up to Zack Morris. \n\nCue \u201cZack Morris is Trash\u201d theme song.", "Yes, exactly. It\u2019s so isolating and dehumanising. I still have anxiety and trust issues now because of it.", "It\u2019s not scary at all. When we watched it back then as kids he was the literal cool popular lead of the show. You judging him today & seeing things differently has nothing to do with OP as a child thinking what we all thought back then."]}
