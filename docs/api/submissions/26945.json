There are zero excuses for how I treated my husband that night at the work social. He is, without a doubt, the personification of a perfect husband. Honestly, at times, I find myself wondering if he's too good for me. He\u2019s the kindest person I know, he\u2019s incredibly supportive of me in every way, he\u2019s funny, he's very intelligent, easy to talk to, and yes, he\u2019s also very good-looking.\n\nI feel heartbroken about the things I said, especially about the fear of heights thing. My husband only bothered overcoming it and crossing that rope bridge for my sake after all.\n\nAfter reading the comments I received and doing extensive self-reflection, I profusely apologized to my husband, and I told him that I do love and respect him. I apologized not only for the things I said that night but also for my general behavior since I got my promotion and my accusations of him being jealous.\n\nBeing him, he accepted my apology immediately and even said that he had already forgiven me because he considered my actions to be a mistake rather than intentional. He then actually apologized as well because he thought that he had spoken out of anger and escalated the situation when we got home.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been trying my best to be worthy of him. He told me that we should let the whole thing be in the past, but I think I always cringe when I think back to that night and the time leading up to it.\n\nThings at work have also been pretty smooth. My husband doesn\u2019t mind going in and chatting with our colleagues. Yesterday, he, in fact, expanded on the rope bridge story with one of our colleagues, so I think he\u2019s comfortable.\n\nNow, I\u2019m really just hoping now that I can be as good a spouse as he is.", "created_utc": 1694814936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jq4u7/update_aita_for_joking_about_my_husband_in_front/", "score": 180, "replies": ["[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e4sds/aita_for_joking_about_my_husband_in_front_of_our/)", "I\u2019m kinda speechless at the amount of grace your husband has. But don\u2019t assume he\u2019s not still deeply wounded. Some things can\u2019t be taken back.", "This update feels like one of those shitty YouTube apologizes. How you acted in the original post just make this update feel like your trying to save face.", "Note: Original post can be found on OP\u2019s profile.\n\nThis update wouldn\u2019t have been necessary if you hadn\u2019t been the AH to begin with. Your husband is the better person and absolutely shouldn\u2019t have apologized. He had every right to be angry. You better spend lots of time making it up to him because you really stepped in it, honey.", "Ngl your husband has more grace than I think I'm even capable of. For his sake at least I hope you mean what you say and that this can be the first step into a much healthier chapter of your marriage.", "Your husband is a good man. Take this opportunity to strengthen your relationship and think before you speak going forward. My father always said that things we say to people are either glue or wedges - they either bring us together or push us apart. Let your words be glue.", "Just because he's put in the past don't once think he's forgotten about it.  No, you don't need to continually apologize...just 'know' that it's still in the air.  Just use it to be a better person.", "> Honestly, at times, I find myself wondering if he's too good for me.\n\nLet me put your wondering to rest. He is WAY too good for you. Shame on you OP. What you said can never be taken back. People will always remember that.", "My God I hope he meets someone else", "Just take note of how he dealt with all this, as everyone at some point gets carried away and screws up, and one day it might even be him who does something like this, and just remember how quickly he accepted your apologies and went towards moving on from it. Also, hopefully this isn't one of those 'I'm doing everything I can to be a better spouse but only until I forget about it and then go back to my old self in a few weeks' type deals. Too many people end up doing that and repeating their mistakes over and over again, so try to stay on this new track. \n\nI will say though that self reflection is not something most people are ever willing to do, so good on you for actually accepting the feedback and making efforts to do something about it. Most people would just shut down their post and justify their behaviour in any way they need to to not feel bad about it. So I really don't think you deserve the ongoing hate.", "OK, I actually read the first post, it was horrible.  This is a fake apology for the sake of the husband, it is not even remotely sincere.  Husband needs to file for a divorce and an HR complaint in that order.  Read the first post if you don't agree.  Wow!!!! \n\nHubby, I know you are reading this.  See a lawyer today!!!!", "I give it less than 6 months and your narcissistic ways will return. Wonder how many times you expect him to forgive you? What happens if you win an award? Will you become this pompous idiot again? Or worse!!! He gets a promotion! How will you react???!!! May feel threatened. \nHe is way too good for you! I noticed you only apologized when you felt like you may lose your target. And Why TF did he apologize to you??? And even worse, why did you let him??!! You should have told him to stop and you didn't deserve one! Apparently you think you did! \nYou remain TA!", "I'm glad that you have seen that you were wrong and are trying to rectify it. One of takeaways I had from your original post is that you were projecting your feelings about your promotion onto your husband and I think you need to explore that more. I don't know if it was you feeling superior to him and in turn thinking less of him because you happened to now have a higher position than him, but it sure seemed that way from the way you acted in demeaning him and not really feeling bad about it at the time - almost like you felt he deserved it. If that is the case you need to do a lot more introspection and maybe some therapy to nip those thoughts in the bud before you do real damage to your marriage.", "i really hope for your husbands sake he moves on", "You\u2019re still the AH.", "YTA, your husband should divorce you still. /s\n\nOK, I actually read the post, I take back the /s.  The husband should still divorce her, she humiliated him in public at his work place as one of his managers.  If she were actually sorry she would apologize in public and resign.", "People here really seem to feel that no one can improve, have self awareness, or take responsibility. Really makes me worried about what they think of themselves.   \nOP I hope that your relationship only improves from here. Good luck to you and you should have some pride in yourself for trying to be better and being aware of your errors. That's a rare and noble trait. I also highly recommend finding a good therapist to everyone (even if there isn't anything \"wrong\" with you). Having someone to bounce thoughts with and work through your improvement with is great.   \n\n\nAlso, its important to remember that being wrong and making mistakes doesn't make you less-than, you are in a relationship of equals. Apologize but constantly lowering your own confidence will just breed quiet resentment which might be what happened here in the first place. Love yourself first so that you can given your best self to your partner! Again good luck and best wishes to both you and your husband.", ">My husband doesn\u2019t mind going in and chatting with our colleagues.

People don\u2019t generally act how OP acts.", "She deserves the hate.", "This post is completely narcissistic, all about her again.  A good apology would be public, at work.", "Agreed.", "Classic.", "Right, I guess ever so perfect people like yourself never make mistakes in any relationship.

Cut people some slack and enough with the whole divorce being the first option nonsense.", "I hope you continue to realize this. Good luck to you both, time heals all wounds.", "I am so very happy when someone takes accountability after self reflection.

I truly wish you and your husband many happy returns and a beautiful wonderful life of joy with each other.", "Did you quit your job yet and get one at another firm?", "It just doesn\u2019t sound or feel genuine.", "I\u2019d do some deeper self-reflection if I were you. With a professional therapist. You didn\u2019t just joke about him. You mean-girl\u2019d so hard that anyone hearing you would assume you 1. Didnt love your husband, 2. Were showing your true colors/mask slipping, 3. Willing to speak about them and other employees as brutally if not more brutally and unprofessionally than you would your own husband.\n\nYeah you apologized. But people who are happy and secure do not ever feel the need to completely obliterate someone for laughs, let alone a loved one. I suspect you have some serious issues with self-esteem.", "Well, in fairness Op is a narcissist and gaslighter that doesn't know the husband love language.  What else could I say, LOL.", "Knock it off with the \u201cperfect\u201d remark. You don\u2019t need to be anywhere close to perfect to not take on some power tripping attitude with your spouse and not talk shit about them to their coworkers.", "Ha, chill out chester, lmao!", "She humiliated him in public at work, as a manager that is above him.  She deserves to be divorced and fired, anyone saying otherwise is an AH to the core.", "Also, time wounds all heels.", "Time does not heal all wounds.

Are you going to divorce him after your next promotion?", "\"When we got there, he greeted a few people but ended up spending most of the time sitting in a corner on his own and only chatting with a few people at a time.\"\n\nSo he socialized like a normal human being? What did you want him to do, make a speech?", "I remember the post. \n\nYour behaviour was beyond normalcy and it's evidently clear you are more of a people pleaser who forgets the world around them sometimes, and it happens so casually that even disrespect and kindle of your husband's personality seems like a mundane incident.\n\nLet's be honest though, you did get a kick and high out of the experience didn't you. You had a blast laughing at him and sharing his personal private details. You might have got away with a meek apology but deep down you still enjoyed it and wouldn't stop that behaviour. Have met quite a handful of such characters so it was interesting to spot one here. \n\nHe deserves better, hope he realizes that.", "As an aside to you bring an AH to your husband who truly deserves better, If I was your colleague, let alone subordinate and heard you belittling and mocking someone like that, I would not want to work with or under you. Snd if you say you wouldn\u2019t do it to anyone else, then why did you do it to him? And can can anyone trust you? You make yourself feel better by tearing other people down, that\u2019s an awful trait and you are no-one\u2019s \u201csuperior\u201d.

Good luck with ever gaining their trust. They probably have HR on speed dial.", " NOPE. not good enough. You disparaged him to his colleagues. You can't undo that. You can be sorry all you want, but you were, in that instance, his superior.  I wouldn't forgive you.\nYTA still.", "Massive AH. She thought she was in the right, people didn't agree so she faked apologized. If she didn't post here, she wouldn't have realized her BS to apologize on her own volition.

Your husband's pure soul doesn't need your toxic ass.", "Maybe, but a lot of guys are capable of forgiving and literally forgetting. Sure, some pain we carry, but if he already gave her the benefit of the doubt and she owned up, that'd be plenty in my book.", "Imagine what people at work think of OP after that episode!", "i mean she admitted fault and isn't singing so it's slightly better", "I've found myself apologising to a narc when they should have been apologising to me.
