Thankfully we broke up so I got off it. \n\nThen with my current bf I got on the mini pill and I had horrible breakouts. On my back too where I had never had acne either. It also killed my sex drive. I\u2019m very resentful of him because he is actually a doctor (a resident so not done yet) and he doesn\u2019t believe women have crazy side effects nor that it\u2019s common to have side effects because it in med school they were told it\u2019s rare. We had been using condoms and he complains about it all the time that he wants to do it raw. It\u2019s so annoying but I feel pressure because most girls in a relationship are on bc and it\u2019s basically expected I have to be. \n\nWe had an agreement I wouldn\u2019t be on bc again until we moved in together. We\u2019ve been dating for just over a year and we moved in together 4 months ago.\n\nAnyway I finally gave in when we moved in together and tried the hormonal iud. I chose the small one with the least dose of hormones. The insertion was so painful I took 2 days off and my bf said I was being dramatic because in school they were taught iud insertion don\u2019t hurt that much. Obviously I blew up because it\u2019s horrible to hear from a bf. \n\nThen I bled for a few month straight again and it caused terrible acne. It also made my have no sex drive and have pms like symptoms where I can get black out angry in a few seconds. Finally after 4 months I took it out and declared I wasn\u2019t using bc anymore. My bf was pissed because now he has to use a condom again. We are currently using condoms and spermicide with family planning. He\u2019s pissed he will be dining this indefinitely and I\u2019m pissed I\u2019m expected to mess with my perfectly healthy body so he can have sex without a condom.

Do you want to be with someone who has so little compassion?!?", "NTA, you made your choice based on your own experiences but boyfriend doesn\u2019t like it. You guys need to have a discussion about what this means for the relationship and whether you guys want and how to continue after this major change in the relationship.

First of all, condoms are way better than medication or devices that are harming you. I bet he threw a fit when your sex drive tanked and he made you have sex with him anyway. It's scary that he's studying medicine, he's not fit for it. I'm a pharmacy technician and I get patients who come to us all the time with severe and/or rare side effects; just because its rare doesn't mean they aren't experiencing horrific pain or discomfort. His willful disbelief (and, let's be honest, complete disregard) of your pain, when you're someone he's supposed to care about, is very concerning and makes me wonder how long he'll keep his medical license--if he even gets it in the first place.

His lack of awareness regarding the side effects (especially as he is working in healthcare!!) and his lack of empathy to your physical and emotional reactions to the hormones is very upsetting. I have had partners like this in the past and it can be a very stressful situation, so sorry you are going through this OP. \n\nYou mentioned using family planning as a method of birth control, have you looked into fertility awareness methods (FAM)? These methods rely on factors such as checking you basal body temperature in the morning before getting out of bed, checking cervical fluids throughout the day as well and recording all of this data to understand how your body changes when you ovulate and make informed decisions regarding when it is safer to have sex without it resulting in pregnancy. I mention it as it is very different than the rhythm method of family planning (which tries to predict your fertile window) FAMs are much safer for preventing pregnancy. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of it I wanted to suggest a great resource is the book \u201ctaking charge of your fertility\u201d by Toni Weschler.
