This happened 6 months ago, but I am legitimately curious to see if I am the AH. I (36M) got married 6 years ago to my wife. My wife\u2019s family is not well-off like mine. When we announced our engagement, my parents gifted us 20k out of the blue for the wedding. We were shocked and so thankful. The money paid for my wife\u2019s dress, my/her siblings wedding party outfits and makeup, and the venue/food. We managed to have a small, beautiful wedding and even had 3k left for the honeymoon. I am beyond thankful for that money and know that we would not have had our wedding without it. Plus, being able to pay for her family\u2019s outfits and makeup really helped lessen their financial burden.\n\nHere is where I need to ask if I am the AH. My sister is getting married and I just happened to be at my parent\u2019s house and got into wedding-talk. My sister was going on and on about all the plans. I come to find that my parents agreed to shell out 35k for the venue and cut her another check for an additional 20k for other expenses. My sister and her fianc\u00e9 are both doctors. These expenses were outrageous to me because I have been married and know it can be done significantly cheaper. I went to my mom and asked why she allowed my sister to pick such an expensive venue and there was time to find another one. We made our wedding work off 20k, how can she excuse my sister\u2019s being 3x the cost? My parents are retired and in their late 60/early 70s. She told me that my sister\u2019s future husband\u2019s family were high-class people and have certain expectations. I asked what that meant and she said that they couldn\u2019t be expected to have such a meager budget like my wedding was.\n\nI was floored. I asked her if she thought 20k was a \u201cmeager budget\u201d and what did that say about what she thought of my wife and her family. My mom said I was making a big deal out of nothing. A woman\u2019s family pays for the wedding, my sister was just having an expensive wedding and it is none of my business. I agree that it is their money and they should spend how they want, but that high-class and meager budget comment has been eating at me since. It seems to me like my mom is saying that my wife was lucky to get a wedding because her family is not well-off. I haven\u2019t mentioned this to my wife because she does have insecurities about how my parents feel about her and it might hurt her. Am I the AH here for calling out my parents on how much they are spending on my sister\u2019s wedding?\nEDIT: A lot of the same questions. My parents did gift us the 20k when we said we wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a big wedding, as my fianc\u00e9\u2019s parents were not able to help. We did not go into this engagement expecting a cash gift for the wedding. We planned to have a small wedding and we had one without going into debt. That would never have been possible without my parents.\nThe other question as to whether I want the additional 35k, of course not! I was making a point to my mom that it was sooo much for a wedding.", "created_utc": 1690029662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156j4um/aita_for_calling_my_parents_out_on_how_much_they/", "score": 889, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Obviously, but it wasn\u2019t your place to know how much was being given. Plus, inflation dude.", "YTA bc you\u2019re being a baby about money you didn\u2019t earn.  And it\u2019s not your business.

And your parents can question all their choices.", "YTA - Yes it may not be \"fair\" that your parents spent less on your wedding than your sisters but does it really matter? I could see if you were both getting married at the same time, and you got 20k and she got 55k that you would be mad, but you already got married. Here getting a 55k wedding doesn't take away anything from you.\n\nIf anything it may be putting your parents more in a bind financially, but really there financials have nothing to do with you.\n\nAlso weddings now are significantly more expensive than they were 6 years ago, after the pandemic venues and catering went way up.", "ESH. You really shouldn\u2019t have asked and Moms explanation was insulting.", "YTA - the money difference is not fair. Increasing costs over six years won\u2019t equate to the difference. However, it sounds like you were very happy with your wedding. Had you not known of the cost for your sister\u2019s you would\u2019ve still been fine. Ignorance is bliss in this scenario. With your parents being wealthy, you\u2019ll be on the receiving end of far more cash than most get when it\u2019s time for an inheritance. Go back to being happy like you were before and forget about it. Happiness is more than just money.", "ESH.\n\nYou got a wedding paid for.\n\nYour sister got a wedding paid for.\n\nYour folks are both extremely generous and utter snobs.\n\nI think you're being too sensitive to your Mom's comments. I would just be happy that my wedding was paid for.", "NTA. Where tf are you guys getting the idea that it should be the brides family paying for the wedding, pay for your own damn wedding, and if anyone offers money to help, be thankful. Also, it sounds like OP is more mad abt the comment his parents made about high class and meager, this implies they think less of his wife and her family, and he has every right to be angry abt that. Also, the fact that the sister was given 3x as much money would make anyone feel bad, it\u2019s like your parents buying you a Christmas gift and then getting your sister one 3x more expensive, anyone would feel hurt and like their sibling is more favored", "YTA.  But not for the reason you think.  That is, you think if you get upset at your parents spending a ton of money on your sister's wedding (as opposed to your own wedding), that might make you an AH.\n\nBut actually, you aren't even asking the right question.  See, any money spent on a wedding is money wasted.  If you spend one dollar on a wedding, that is  one dollar too much.  Think about it.  Who needs a wedding?  It is a formal event celebrating the fact that you just got the government involved in your relationship.  Why do we celebrate that?   If anything, all guests and participants at such an event should be dressed in black from head to toe, and packs of Kleenex should be distributed to everyone by the greeters.\n\nWhen you get your head in the right place, with respect to what a wedding actually is...\n\nThen spending money on the wedding is no different than any other purchase that is made with \"fun money\".  \n\nIn that context.  Your parents spent $20K of fun money on your wedding.  OK.  Then your parents are spending $55K of fun money or maybe even more on your sister's wedding.  OK.   That is like:  So the parents spent $35K fun money on a Prius they don't need.  Then several years later they spend $70K fun money on a Tesla they don't need.  Does it say anything about you or your marriage or your wife?  Not at all.\n\nIt's all fun money.  We all (if we are smart with money) have a certain amount of money to spend on fun stuff.  I just bought a new computer I didn't need for $300.  My kid just bought a new computer he didn't need for $600.  Each of us spent our \"fun money\" to do that.  I'm not going to criticize him for spending twice as much on a computer that is (arguably) less powerful than the computer I bought.  It's his fun money, he earned it.  \n\nNow do you get it?  Your parents are spending fun money.  The AH move is assuming that how they spend their fun money has any bearing on how they think about you or your wife.  They had fun blowing money on your wedding.  Now they are having fun blowing money on your sister's wedding.", ">my sister was just having an expensive wedding and it is none of my business\n\nIt's not your wedding, *it is none of your business*\n\nYTA. Mind your own business and move on.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Y T A here. \n\nI would totally go low contact with my family if I felt there was such a disparity with my sibling. Specially if my mom thinks my partner is less worthy. \n\nThe sister should be able to afford the extra of her own wedding. I would go low contact with the family so some time after this conversation. NTA", "YTA.  They gave you $20 k and you had a nice wedding.  Sis is having a different style wedding.  You\u2019re both grown adults, leave the childish competitions behind.", "NTA.\n\nWhile they can spend their money how they want, if they don\u2019t keep what they do equable, then they have to accept being called out for it.\n\nAnd your mothers comments were just plain rude.\n\nYou probably need to make 2 decisions based on this. \n\n1 - do you go to the wedding or not (personally I\u2019d not go, they think their new family is better than yours, so why go where you are not wanted or appreciated)\n\n2 - removing yourself from any future responsibilities to do with your parents (ie when they need to be put in a home, or when they have run through all their money and need help financially) (this one is a bit more complicated and difficult than the wedding, but I\u2019d still edge towards removing yourself, again why take on the responsibility when you are not thought of as equal to your sister and her new family)", "YTA\n\nYou received a gracious gift of $20k.  Traditionally it is the responsibility of the bride's family to cover most of the wedding day expenses with the groom's family paying for other things.  It sounds like you chose to use this money to cover all your expenses and pay for a honeymoon.  Yes, these are antiquated gender roles, but you were also paying for the wedding with money that was a gift from your parents, so here we are.  Personally I think the whole wedding industry is a bit of a scam, but they do also deserve to charge a premium for dealing with brides.\n\nSo your parents are choosing to spend more of their money on a wedding for your sister.  Does this make their gift to you less gracious?  Do you love your wife less because not as much money was spent on your wedding day?  What remediation do you want, them to not spend $1 more than you on her wedding, or them to pay over the difference?  Live your life, love your wife, and be happy for your sister that is getting married, stop sweating about money that isn't yours.", "Gently, YTA. Your parents were very generous to gift you any money. And your mother is correct in saying that traditionally the bride's family pays for the wedding. It sounds like your wife isn't the only one who's insecure about her humble origins. Regardless, don't go asking questions if you're not going to like the answers. Be thankful for their generosity and forgive your mom for the off-hand boomer comment and move on. Good luck to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's meant to be about love, the marriage, not money.", "NTA. So, I have a similar situation but it isn\u2019t weddings. I\u2019m 5 years older than my sister. My parents have helped me in times of need, but I bet in my entire adult life they have given me MAYBE $5000. I found out a couple years ago that they have given my sister more than $45,000. I never brought it up to my parents but it feels shitty. They helped her through college. They still pay for many of her expenses (she is 29 and married, I am 34). Am I grateful for the $5000 I\u2019ve received in the past 15 years? Yes. Does it still rub me wrong that they have continuously set my sister up for success in her life by throwing money at her?

This dude is a white American, and as a white dude from Canada with an middle/upper middle class background I can safely say you all are weirdos. What tradition are you all referring to? Even in my parents generation the wife\u2019s family didn\u2019t pay for the wedding. Most people just pay for their own weddings. If a spouse comes from wealth and their family wants to help pay for their children\u2019s wedding that\u2019s all fine and good, but I\u2019d never think this case is anything other than favouritism or sexism. Yes it\u2019s their money and they can spend it how they want, but why do they want to spend 3x more on their daughters wedding than yours? Especially if she and her husband are so gainfully employed? Maybe it\u2019s a rich wasp culture thing, and your sisters in laws kinda forced the tradition onto your parents to keep up appearances. That kinda seems like what your mom could\u2019ve been saying, but the classism in her reply could just as well mean this was an independent decision. To me it seems they wanted their little girl to have a fantastic wedding, that\u2019s great! Fantastic weddings do not cost 60,000$. Ohhhh inFlATiOn!!!!!!! Ok, 20% is what I saw an event planner say in these comments is the approx. difference in costs the last half decade has seen, not 300%. I get the grooms family covered costs for the rehearsal and that is also very generous, but it is not 60k generous, and if they were that worried with classist appearances they wouldn\u2019t be serving backyard BBQ at a rehearsal for a fancy wedding that costs 60 bands. This all just seems like insecure upper middle class culture(in laws and your parents) striving to present themselves as classier and more cultured, which apparently can only be done by adhering to some vague notion of American wedding tradition that just doesn\u2019t exist. I think really your mom was being honest, they probably spent more money because they were pressured to by rich/foreign(maybe it\u2019s their tradition?) in-laws, or weren\u2019t pressured but felt they needed to because they\u2019re insecure in their class. \n\nEither way, none of this matters. Your parents clearly love you and respect your partner and your partnership enough to pay for your wedding.

Maybe take some distance and therapy if that thought is hurting you. Otherwise just forget about the whole thing, don\u2019t tell your wife, and don\u2019t miss your sisters wedding.
