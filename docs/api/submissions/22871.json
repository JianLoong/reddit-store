This happened 6 months ago, but I am legitimately curious to see if I am the AH. I (36M) got married 6 years ago to my wife. My wife\u2019s family is not well-off like mine. When we announced our engagement, my parents gifted us 20k out of the blue for the wedding. We were shocked and so thankful. The money paid for my wife\u2019s dress, my/her siblings wedding party outfits and makeup, and the venue/food. We managed to have a small, beautiful wedding and even had 3k left for the honeymoon. I am beyond thankful for that money and know that we would not have had our wedding without it. Plus, being able to pay for her family\u2019s outfits and makeup really helped lessen their financial burden.\n\nHere is where I need to ask if I am the AH. My sister is getting married and I just happened to be at my parent\u2019s house and got into wedding-talk. My sister was going on and on about all the plans. I come to find that my parents agreed to shell out 35k for the venue and cut her another check for an additional 20k for other expenses. My sister and her fianc\u00e9 are both doctors. These expenses were outrageous to me because I have been married and know it can be done significantly cheaper. I went to my mom and asked why she allowed my sister to pick such an expensive venue and there was time to find another one. We made our wedding work off 20k, how can she excuse my sister\u2019s being 3x the cost? My parents are retired and in their late 60/early 70s. She told me that my sister\u2019s future husband\u2019s family were high-class people and have certain expectations. I asked what that meant and she said that they couldn\u2019t be expected to have such a meager budget like my wedding was.\n\nI was floored. I asked her if she thought 20k was a \u201cmeager budget\u201d and what did that say about what she thought of my wife and her family. My mom said I was making a big deal out of nothing. A woman\u2019s family pays for the wedding, my sister was just having an expensive wedding and it is none of my business. I agree that it is their money and they should spend how they want, but that high-class and meager budget comment has been eating at me since. It seems to me like my mom is saying that my wife was lucky to get a wedding because her family is not well-off. I haven\u2019t mentioned this to my wife because she does have insecurities about how my parents feel about her and it might hurt her. Am I the AH here for calling out my parents on how much they are spending on my sister\u2019s wedding?", "created_utc": 1690029662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156j4um/aita_for_calling_my_parents_out_on_how_much_they/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What your parents do with their money is none of your business. \nYou need to let it go. If you and your wife were happy making it work with 20k, why are you complaining?\n\nDamn, I\u2019d be lucky to get $100 from my family towards a wedding let alone 20k. \n\nDoes it sting to kbow your sister is getting more? Obviously, but it wasn\u2019t your place to know how much was being given. Plus, inflation dude.", "YTA bc you\u2019re being a baby about money you didn\u2019t earn.  And it\u2019s not your business. But since the cats out of the bag, perhaps you could ask your folks for an additional $35k so you and your wife can feel equal?  And your parents can question all their choices.", "YTA - Yes it may not be \"fair\" that your parents spent less on your wedding than your sisters but does it really matter? I could see if you were both getting married at the same time, and you got 20k and she got 55k that you would be mad, but you already got married. Here getting a 55k wedding doesn't take away anything from you.\n\nIf anything it may be putting your parents more in a bind financially, but really there financials have nothing to do with you.\n\nAlso weddings now are significantly more expensive than they were 6 years ago, after the pandemic venues and catering went way up.", "ESH. You really shouldn\u2019t have asked and Moms explanation was insulting.", "YTA - the money difference is not fair. Increasing costs over six years won\u2019t equate to the difference. However, it sounds like you were very happy with your wedding. Had you not known of the cost for your sister\u2019s you would\u2019ve still been fine. Ignorance is bliss in this scenario. With your parents being wealthy, you\u2019ll be on the receiving end of far more cash than most get when it\u2019s time for an inheritance. Go back to being happy like you were before and forget about it. Happiness is more than just money.", "ESH.\n\nYou got a wedding paid for.\n\nYour sister got a wedding paid for.\n\nYour folks are both extremely generous and utter snobs.\n\nI think you're being too sensitive to your Mom's comments. I would just be happy that my wedding was paid for.", "NTA. Where tf are you guys getting the idea that it should be the brides family paying for the wedding, pay for your own damn wedding, and if anyone offers money to help, be thankful. Also, it sounds like OP is more mad abt the comment his parents made about high class and meager, this implies they think less of his wife and her family, and he has every right to be angry abt that. Also, the fact that the sister was given 3x as much money would make anyone feel bad, it\u2019s like your parents buying you a Christmas gift and then getting your sister one 3x more expensive, anyone would feel hurt and like their sibling is more favored", "YTA.  But not for the reason you think.  That is, you think if you get upset at your parents spending a ton of money on your sister's wedding (as opposed to your own wedding), that might make you an AH.\n\nBut actually, you aren't even asking the right question.  See, any money spent on a wedding is money wasted.  If you spend one dollar on a wedding, that is  one dollar too much.  Think about it.  Who needs a wedding?  It is a formal event celebrating the fact that you just got the government involved in your relationship.  Why do we celebrate that?   If anything, all guests and participants at such an event should be dressed in black from head to toe, and packs of Kleenex should be distributed to everyone by the greeters.\n\nWhen you get your head in the right place, with respect to what a wedding actually is...\n\nThen spending money on the wedding is no different than any other purchase that is made with \"fun money\".  \n\nIn that context.  Your parents spent $20K of fun money on your wedding.  OK.  Then your parents are spending $55K of fun money or maybe even more on your sister's wedding.  OK.   That is like:  So the parents spent $35K fun money on a Prius they don't need.  Then several years later they spend $70K fun money on a Tesla they don't need.  Does it say anything about you or your marriage or your wife?  Not at all.\n\nIt's all fun money.  We all (if we are smart with money) have a certain amount of money to spend on fun stuff.  I just bought a new computer I didn't need for $300.  My kid just bought a new computer he didn't need for $600.  Each of us spent our \"fun money\" to do that.  I'm not going to criticize him for spending twice as much on a computer that is (arguably) less powerful than the computer I bought.  It's his fun money, he earned it.  \n\nNow do you get it?  Your parents are spending fun money.  The AH move is assuming that how they spend their fun money has any bearing on how they think about you or your wife.  They had fun blowing money on your wedding.  Now they are having fun blowing money on your sister's wedding.", ">my sister was just having an expensive wedding and it is none of my business\n\nIt's not your wedding, *it is none of your business*\n\nYTA. Mind your own business and move on.", "I don\u2019t understand all the Y T A here. \n\nI would totally go low contact with my family if I felt there was such a disparity with my sibling. Specially if my mom thinks my partner is less worthy. \n\nThe sister should be able to afford the extra of her own wedding. I would go low contact with the family so some time after this conversation. NTA", "YTA.  They gave you $20 k and you had a nice wedding.  Sis is having a different style wedding.  You\u2019re both grown adults, leave the childish competitions behind.", "NTA.\n\nWhile they can spend their money how they want, if they don\u2019t keep what they do equable, then they have to accept being called out for it.\n\nAnd your mothers comments were just plain rude.\n\nYou probably need to make 2 decisions based on this. \n\n1 - do you go to the wedding or not (personally I\u2019d not go, they think their new family is better than yours, so why go where you are not wanted or appreciated)\n\n2 - removing yourself from any future responsibilities to do with your parents (ie when they need to be put in a home, or when they have run through all their money and need help financially) (this one is a bit more complicated and difficult than the wedding, but I\u2019d still edge towards removing yourself, again why take on the responsibility when you are not thought of as equal to your sister and her new family)", "YTA\n\nYou received a gracious gift of $20k.  Traditionally it is the responsibility of the bride's family to cover most of the wedding day expenses with the groom's family paying for other things.  It sounds like you chose to use this money to cover all your expenses and pay for a honeymoon.  Yes, these are antiquated gender roles, but you were also paying for the wedding with money that was a gift from your parents, so here we are.  Personally I think the whole wedding industry is a bit of a scam, but they do also deserve to charge a premium for dealing with brides.\n\nSo your parents are choosing to spend more of their money on a wedding for your sister.  Does this make their gift to you less gracious?  Do you love your wife less because not as much money was spent on your wedding day?  What remediation do you want, them to not spend $1 more than you on her wedding, or them to pay over the difference?  Live your life, love your wife, and be happy for your sister that is getting married, stop sweating about money that isn't yours.", "Gently, YTA. Your parents were very generous to gift you any money. And your mother is correct in saying that traditionally the bride's family pays for the wedding. It sounds like your wife isn't the only one who's insecure about her humble origins. Regardless, don't go asking questions if you're not going to like the answers. Be thankful for their generosity and forgive your mom for the off-hand boomer comment and move on. Good luck to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The way you phrase it, I can't see anything constructive coming out of this other than hurt feelings -- unless you want your parents to give you money to make things more equal, somehow?", "YTA, your mother is right, traditionally the brides family takes care of the wedding and reception, while the groom's family takes care of rehearsal.  That said 6 yrs ago your parents gave you 20K for YOUR wedding, they are covering much more of your sister's and your jealous.

It's not your business. With that said, your mom's comments and implication were shitty and hurtful.", "YTA. It may be antiquated but it is traditional for the bride's family to pay for the wedding.

They gave you 20 thousand dollars that they didn't have to and you had a lovely wedding. This sounds more like jealousy on your part and not them slighting your wife.", "YTA. You missed the key statement. \"A woman's family pays for the wedding.\" That's the tradition. When they saw this wasn't the case, your family stepped up and made your wedding happen. Now they are paying for a wedding they most likely budgeted for a long time ago.\n\nYou can't go into \"But sis got more,\" because the situations are not equivalent. Sis gets more because mom is the *mother* of the bride. That's a completely different expectation than mother of the groom.\n\nLet's not even get into how much the cost of living has risen in the last 6 years.

ALso silly to say 'since last year vs 6 years ago', that implies that inflation hasn't been out of control for the past year but has been steady across the past 6 years. 95% of the increase over the past 6 years is the increase that happened in the last year.\n\nOp is NTA.

There\u2019s nothing wrong with your wife coming from a non-wealthy family.", "It\u2019s outrageous, but unfortunately 20k is meager for a wedding by todays standards. Typically the wife\u2019s family does pay for the wedding, so in most people\u2019s minds what your parents did would be considered supplemental, not the whole budget. I find wedding culture to be pretty toxic and the traditions antiquated, but that doesn\u2019t change the situation.
