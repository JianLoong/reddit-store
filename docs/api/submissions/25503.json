Although there were no pictures on the profile, he sent some explicit images that made me recognize him. We didnt talk much and I stopped replying as soon as I suspected it was him. I'm not friends with Lily, but we do have mutual friends, \"Amy\" and \"Sarah\", outside work and I have her on Instagram.\n\nI was unsure about whether to inform Lily or if I was even certain it was really Josh, so I decided to confide in Amy and Sarah. To protect Josh's privacy, I edited the explicit images to only reveal the necessary information for them to know if it was really him. Both were stunned, confirming that the person in the pictures was indeed Josh. I didn't know if I should tell Lily what I found out, so I asked for Amy's and Sarah's opinion. Sarah believed that either she or Amy should break the news to Lily since they were closer to her. On the other hand, Amy felt it was my responsibility, given that I had made the discovery. Ultimately, I decided to tell Lily myself.\n\nOne evening after work, I invited her for coffee and gently relayed my findings, sharing the photos and our Grindr conversation. Lily seemed visibly shaken and embarrassed but didn't comment much. Two days after, I saw her at work and she looked like she just cried so I approached her and told her that if she wanted to talk I was there for her. She then told me I had no business telling Amy and Sarah about any of this and that I was an asshole for medling in her life. I was shocked, but we were at work so I left her alone.\n\nApparently, after I informed Sarah and Amy that I had spoken with Lily about my discovery, they decided to approach her about it. They were concerned for Lily and didn't think she should stay with Josh. During their conversation, Lily felt cornered and eventually told them that she actually enjoys watching Josh get it on with other men. It's a kink they have. Lily was deeply upset that this secret part of her life was now known by others and she squarely blames me for this revelation. I feel bad that this happened, but I dont see how I did anything wrong here. So, I wanted to ask if I was the asshole in this situation.\n\nEDIT: I didn't out Josh's sexuality. Amy and Sarah mentioned to me that he was openly bi before he began dating Lily.

You were concerned that he was cheating on her, not making fun of her.", "nta. josh was the one who outed himself, and then lily was the one who outed her kink, not you. that\u2019s the risk you take when you\u2019re putting yourself out there on a public forum.", "This one is tricky, but NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s soliciting sex on a place he can be identified, from a person it seems like he\u2019s met before too.

Since he didn\u2019t do either of these things you were justifiably concerned. This is a risk you take if you are looking for poly hookups on dating apps.\n\nHonestly I think the awkwardness is on Lily. She could have just said \u201coh yeah, it\u2019s consensual it\u2019s ok\u201d. She made it awkward by disclosing more than was necessary, and by being so self conscious about it.

If you're not close enough to know it, you have no business meddling. Unless you know someone's definition of cheating from their own words, butt off preemptively.\n\nAlso yes,you basically outed two people - one bi male and kinky female - to people they obviously didn't plan of out themselves. You should tell her you're sorry.", "OP YTA...You admitted you don't really know Lily. Therefore, it really wasn't your place to say anything to anyone. You stuck your nose where it didn't belong.

YTA for outing the boyfriend's sexuality, and Lily's.\n\nAs a well seasoned Grindr gay myself, the approach I would've taken would've been to speak to Josh - I would've said I know Lily and asked if they have an open relationship. If the answer was yes, the follow-up question would be whether she knows. If there's a nonresponse to either of these questions, you know not to get involved with him and he's had the opportunity to set the record straight - your choice what to do from there. \nIf the answer is that she does know, I'd look to understand the boundaries/rules so you can make sure that you're respectful of their relationship.\n\n...

Your primary concerns in your comments is that talking to Lily first would have been awkward, but do you think the whole situation *isn\u2019t* awkward as all hell now? You being wrong by talking to Lily would not have been *nearly* as awkward or embarassing as Lily probably feels now after being put on the spot by her friends.\n\nThis needed to be handled with Lily and/or Josh, nobody else", "She is right, you should've gone directly to her and not shared this information with her friends. I know your intentions were good but I also think her feelings are valid and feeling like people gossiping about you behind your back is not great. \n\nSlight soft YTA for this.

It was either come clean or deal with \"friends\" constantly intervening in her private life because they think her BF is a cheater. Not to mention such assumptions would also affect how they would treat Josh at gatherings/social get togets etc. \n\nYou had no business dragging other people in this considering you barely knew her to begin with.

As someone who has been cheated on before, I was glad when someone told me what was happening. I wanted to help Lily if that was the case, but I don't know her well so I went to talk to people who I know are close to her to get second opinions.
