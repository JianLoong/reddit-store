She could have just said \u201coh yeah, it\u2019s consensual it\u2019s ok\u201d. She made it awkward by disclosing more than was necessary, and by being so self conscious about it.

If you're not close enough to know it, you have no business meddling.

If the answer was yes, the follow-up question would be whether she knows. If there's a nonresponse to either of these questions, you know not to get involved with him and he's had the opportunity to set the record straight - your choice what to do from there. \nIf the answer is that she does know, I'd look to understand the boundaries/rules so you can make sure that you're respectful of their relationship.\n\n...

Coworkers aren\u2019t friends, it isn\u2019t worth ruining your work environment which was the end result anyway, just way worse", "Then that's on Josh. Josh is the one with the commitment to Lily, not OP.\n\nYour second question applies to anything with relationships/dating/hook-ups. Heck, same goes for asking someone whether they've had unprotected sex since their last HIV test. OP will know whether Josh is lying, just the same as OP would know with any other Grindr guy. It's up to OP where he draws his line in regards to whether to trust someone", "Not reading all that. Mind your business, that\u2019s all.", "so you thought talking about lily, who you thought was directly involved, was too much but telling 2 other people that had nothing to do with this was the right decision?", "If \"Lily\" starts slipping at work, doing poorly, crying alot, decides to quit, your name could come up with HR in that meeting.  That is all I am saying.  Especially if it creates a hostile work environment.  \n\n\nAlso to add to \"He has a Public Profile on a dating App, here is the Grindr Agreements you accepted\"  \n\n\n1.\tYou will NOT use the Grindr Services or any information displayed within the Grindr Services to \u201cstalk,\u201d harass, abuse, defame, threaten, defraud, or otherwise mistreat other Users;\r  \n2.\tYou will NOT violate the privacy or other rights of Users, or collect, attempt to collect, store, or disclose without permission the location or personal information about other Users\r  \n3.\tYou will NOT post, store, send, transmit, or disseminate any information or material which a reasonable person could deem to be objectionable, defamatory, libelous, offensive, obscene, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, distressing, vulgar, hateful, racially or ethnically or otherwise offensive to any group or individual, intentionally misleading, false, or otherwise inappropriate, regardless of whether this material or its dissemination is unlawful;\r  \n4.\tYou will NOT interfere with anyone\u2019s ability to use or enjoy the Grindr Service, or aid or encourage any activity prohibited by this Agreement.", "She's trying to rationalize it to herself now that's she's been embarrassed over it. She probably didn't know, but now that she does she doesn't want to leave him but her friends are telling her to leave him. So now she's taking it out on the person who told her friends", "I mean isn't that the picture that was already painted?\n\nDudes on a public profile on grindr showing identifying images to strangers", "Bro, it is not that black and white. This dude barely knows Lily. You know how weird it would have been to approach somebody you don\u2019t know and start a possibly sensitive conversation?", "When I was cheated on, some people told me that if this happened to them, they would rather not know. Since I don't know Lily well, I wanted to get second opinions of people who actually knows her.\n\n You could say \"you should've kept this quiet, it was none of your business\", but it was made my business since Josh sent me explicit pics with his face on. I thought For me, I had the moral obligation to at least know if Lily would rather know or not about this.", "Yup. It\u2019s Lilys boyfriend in question, not her friends. \n\nConversation could\u2019ve went \u201chey this is really weird, but I might\u2019ve come across Josh on grindr, I don\u2019t really know if it\u2019s him but if it is and you don\u2019t know he\u2019s on here maybe you should\u201d and this would\u2019ve been mitigated and maybe even OP woulda seen some action lol", "I\u2019m not arguing that I am or not TA. I\u2019m stating reasons behind my actions that weren\u2019t in the original post", "I clearly didn't violate any of these agreements.  \n\n\n1. I didn't mistreat him in any way nor did I defame him since I never told anyone he was cheating. I only said he was on the platform, and this is not defamation, since it's public\n2. The only information about him that I shared was his face, which is not a personal information\n3. The photos I showed didn't have anything explicit on them. It was just his face\n4. Nothing that I did prevent him of enjoying the Grindr service.   \n\n\nI didn't in anyway created a hostile work environment, since the reason she's upset is because her kink is no longer a secret. And she was the one who decided to share it with other people, not me.", "Many people are poly, cheating is an assumptions you can make but, its still just an assumption. That response you suggest would be taken as confirmation that she didnt know. If this happened to me i would not be comfortable confirming my partner as a cheater when they are not.", "Then he shouldn't have said anything to anybody, except maybe Josh.  It really is that black and white.", "It\u2019s a tough decision and I get why you went to her friends but ultimately you needed to just take the risk of going directly to her.", "you had no business involving other people lmfao", "I think you are misunderstanding what Public Information Means.  His profile was anonomyous without any photos, he sent you private information (photos), that you shared publicly without consent which can be abuse.  Don't think of those words as defined by a 3rd grade teacher, but rather a lawyer.\n\nSharing his Face is absolutely disclosing his information without consent.  If you would have said, hey mind if I share this with my friends, I work with your girlfriend, he would have been okay with that?\n\n3) Ya that apparently was embarrassing, it doesn't have to meet every word criteria.  \n\n\n4) I would most certainly say, that he specifically was trying to maintain anonymity without using a profile pic, you outing him to his circle of friends would definitly discourage use of the app, or enjoying it.", "You brought out someone's personal sex life into the work place. Tattled to friends about it. Such a trash thing to do.", "Except \"omg I'll talk to him\" doesn't confirm cheating.\n\nBursting out going \"omg that fucks cheating on me\" or something does.\n\nyou're not been explicit about him cheating by saying you'll talk to him. This is an assumption you have made.\n\n---\n\nWhat do you expect to happen when your partner advertises themselves in public forums with identifying marks?", "Yeah, if that happens again I\u2019ll do that for sure. But in the moment it\u2019s was a hard decision to make and it could\u2019ve backfired both ways.", "Agreement 3 states that:  \n\n\n>You will NOT post, store, send, transmit, or disseminate any information or material which a *reasonable* person could deem to be objectionable...\n\na *reasonable* person would not deem a face to be objectionable... etc. Therefore, by Grindr's agreement I *am* allowed to share his face. Otherwise would say I cannot share *any* pictures sent by other users or something like that. \n\nSince the only information that I shared was his face, and that is allowed I did not violate any of the Grindr's agreement", "I didn't bring her sex life into the work place. Amy, Sarah and I are friends from outside work. I only shared that I thought I found Lily's bf on Grindr. He was the one that was sending explicit pictures with his face on them to strangers on Grindr.\n\nI have been cheated on and found out through a friend. I was glad someone told me, even if it hurt at the time. I was unsure if I should talk about this with Lily, since I don't know her very well and wanted to gather second opinions from people who actually knows her. I also wasn't even sure if that was Josh or some other look-alike. \n\nIf I wanted to just gossip, I would've told Amy and Sarah about this and let them deal with the information, and not care at all.", "Talk to him about what? That response only makes sense if the person didnt know. And I expect people to ask me about it instead of spreading it around the office.", "It would've backfired anyways but by going directly to her you wouldnt have involved other people for no reason.", "you clearly have a history of  sharing other people's business, do better."]}
