All it does is encourage shitty behavior.", "NTA. They should have addressed James\u2019s creepy behavior years ago", "NTA. It's not like you intentionally started crying just to be manipulative or get your way. You had an emotional reaction to feeling violated, which makes sense.

Shouldn't it be James that ruin his cousin's party for tailing and taking pics of his brother's fiance\u00e9?

I\u2019d work on backing him down, though. Ignoring him obviously isn\u2019t working, so embarrass the crap out of him loudly. Instead of screaming and leaving, you could have started loudly drawing attention to his behavior: \u201cdid you just take suggestive shots of me?

Your tears were genuine upset at being abused by James, serially, for years. \n\nWhy does mark put up with this? Persoanlly, I'd be tempted beat my brother for half of what James has done to you but in reality that would not be productive and I'd never advocate that kind of response.

You were once again the victimised and harassed by James and reacted as you felt. Therefore your reaction is legitimate, it is your own and it is not up for debate.\n\nMark's reaction is key here.

There is no reason that his brother should be anywhere near you when he's acting this way.

But again, Mark needs to tell his family that the two of you will no longer be going to family events so long as the brother is there, and that the brother's actions are inappropriate. If the family continues to side with the brother...than I guess that is their choice. Again, the brother ruined this, not you.", "NTA. Do. Not. Marry. Mark.\n\nDo not marry anyone who brings you in contact with sexual predators. The most basic requirement in a spouse is that they only bring good people into your life because they love you too much to do otherwise.\n\nIf Mark were even a minimally decent pretense of a person, let alone a good one, he would have nothing to do with James, at all. Even if he were single.", "NTA. These people are. And I mean your boyfriend too.

Then leave and go NC with said perv. The real question is why you willingly get within a thousand feet of James the creeper. Why has your fianc\u00e9 not shut this crap down?!?!?

Heck, *you didn't hit your threshold,  you were PUSHED PAST IT.* \n\nAnd having been pushed past it, you left. You didn't verbally assault the creap. You didnt snatch the camera and destroy it. You, and presumably your fianc\u00e9 were very restrained. (Unless he tore a strip out of his brother, before joining you. Which I would personally applaud.)  \n\nWhat were you supposed to do, wear a Habib to the beach? Stay covered and not swim, just in case your figure entice poor innocent James?

This behavior is common from the brother and documented with his suspension and in the text which I\u2019m sure you were smart enough to save or screenshot to save to a file, plus the pictures at the beach. All this stuff you should be going to the cops, report him. It could save your life and the lives of other women. \n\nWhy is your BF and his family allowing this? They should be embarrassed they have a creepier in the family doing god knows what to other females. I would have to agree James isn\u2019t just being creepy to you.

He was suspended in high school for sneaking into the girls locker room, has harassed OP through text after she rejected him and makes sexual comments/jokes when there are no witnesses to OP. I\u2019m not sure when OP posted the update but all that information was included.", "I was actually thinking about him and our son \ud83d\ude02", "Maybe because she noticed her fianc\u00e9\u2019s creepy brother behind her with a camera??", "As if that makes a difference?", "Yup a bunch of internet toddlers jerking each other off and only reading what they want to see", "Your parents have failed you", "> How about you judge the fact he has a history of being a pervert in general? He was suspended in high school for sneaking into the girls locker room, has harassed OP through text after she rejected him and makes sexual comments/jokes when there are no witnesses to OP.\n\nHow about you judge the fact that OP says he hasn't done anything since high school. People make mistakes and change. It's called growth. And from OPs description, he has done that. I have seen zero PROOF that he did anything wrong at the beach. None. The dude took a picture of something (none of us know what) and OP had a meltdown. That's literally all we know.", "Her brother who is a professional photographer and by her own admission hasn't been creepy since she got with his brother.  Look he may be a creep, but he also might not be.", "You said i invented the narrative they used a camera for work.  What else does a photographer do?", "I\u2019m gonna explain this to you very clearly so you can understand. Other people don\u2019t have to change the way they act so that people don\u2019t act like creeps. Anything you said before you told OP to change their actions becomes void and you are now taking the creeps side. I\u2019m gonna assume you also like to take pictures of women when they arnt looking.", "You\u2019re hilarious dude. My parents failed me because I think people shouldn\u2019t act like creeps? No my parents failed me by being absent I\u2019m just a decent person", "He followed her into the water with a camera and followed her out of the water then snapped a picture while behind her that made him \u201cgiddy\u201d. Sounds totally normal for him to do when its clear she is creeped out by him. If he actually has changed and respected that he has crossed boundaries in the past he would\u2019ve kept his space and not done things that seem insanely sketchy like he did.\n\nYes it\u2019s possible he has changed since high school but there\u2019s less proof of him having changed then there is of creepy behaviour currently", "Why on earth are you capping for a creep", "So you're telling me, that we should give the brother, who has a long history of creepy behaviors towards OP especially, the benefit of the doubt? That OP should've just been like \"Oh, he took a picture from behind, was giggling about it to himself, but I shouldn't react because he **might** not have taken a picture of me despite his past behaviors?\n\nThe brother stopped when OP and Mark \\*got engaged\\*. While dating, as she said, he made sexual comments and jokes about her when they were just alone.", "Because you\u2019re trying to derail the point of this post.  He could have a press badge and still be a creep to OP.", "You're a fucking sheep with your blinders on, have you ever had your own critical thought in your life? This isn't about changing what other people wear or act. I was nearly suggesting to mitigate get being uncomfortable in front of him. Some things you can't control, some things you can, you can't expect the world to change around you and for you so if you're in an uncomfortable situation it's on you to make yourself more comfortable. Also you're cringe af", "Dude everybody thinks people shouldn't act like creeps, but guess what creeps exist and there's no amount of \"tell the boys not to stare\" that will change that. Its reasonable to be angry but not reasonable to scream at people unless your life is in danger, yes your parents did fail you because you obviously can't control your emotions and don't know when the appropriate time is to scream like a baby.", "You're instead telling me we should assume the worst about someone based on behaivours they seem to have changed.  Once a bad person always one  right?  People never change or grow.\n\nLook, at no point have i criticized OP for her actions or called her an asshole.  In a perfect world she would have asked him what he was taking pictures of and if he acted shifty then she would have a good idea.  This isn't a perfect world and people get stressed and her reactions are understandable, but that doesn't mean she is right.  The evidence is massively circumstancial and seemingly based more on OPs fears and padt prejudices than what actually happened.  You all sitting around shouting \"yeah he's a creep\" isn't helping anyone here.", "That i agree on, go back to your witch trials, were the mob shouts guilty and no one cares about facts.", "Lol the twisting and turning you're doing to justify this gross behavior is just sad and tells so much about you", "So, let me get this straight. You were suggesting to change xyz about her situation, however in the same breath say \"can't expect the world to change\" and you don't understand how you're being hypocritical? Dude was historically a creep, and you are defending said creep. It's simple. Don't be a creep. I'm sure you defend rapists when they say \"she was wearing a skirt\" grow up.", "\"it's okay to be angry, no not like that\" you're the entire circus."]}
