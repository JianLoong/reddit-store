First they assumed I was going with my husband (idk why they assumed that) and were counting him as one more head so they were gonna split it in 4. Idk where the miscommunication happen but once I told them  he wasn\u2019t they switched to a smaller apt. \n\nOkay so once we split it in 3 and paid, literally 30 min after, one of the two friends said \u201cbtw my friend wants to come too! She can stay with me in the couch\u201d so I said, oh I\u2019d be fun to have more people! Are we then splitting in 4 ? Or how should we add her? She\u2019s basically saying since she\u2019s sharing a couch she shouldn\u2019t pay for the full 5 days staying in our apartment !? I think she\u2019s paying my friend half of her part to share the bed with her ( so about $250) which I think is nonsense. ( note: she splits everything evenly even gas when driving us, which I understand, even if this friend is literally a trust fund) \n\nMy other friend said she doesn\u2019t mind her coming but agrees she should pay, however she\u2019s not confrontational so didn\u2019t say anything. They expected my husband to pay when they counted him when we \u201c are sharing a bed\u201d so idk why this would be different in terms of finances. \n\nAITA!?\n\n\nEdit: Looks like cool friend and I are sharing a bed and annoying friend was supposed to stay in the sofa bed alone, now her friend is joining her. To me, it\u2019s tricky to know for sure how to split now. Some people think it\u2019s by person and other think is my bed/ type of bed ?
