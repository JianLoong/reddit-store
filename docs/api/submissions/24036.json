{"id": 24036, "submission_id": "15jyov1", "title": "AITA for telling my husband that he is a cheap husband and that I can get any man to spend money on me?", "selftext": "I (30f) and my husband (33m). We have been married for 2 years and together for 5. I pay 70% of our bills and I also pay anywhere we go out. I buy him gifts and I do everything. I am a romantic person but he is not at all. Since he makes less than me I never had an issue with how everything has been set up. Even though he keeps insisting that we pay 50% /50% which is a big bullshit because I pay 60% of rent and I pay hydro, internet bill etc. he only pays 40% of rent and for his car. Today, was the last straw where I really got pissed off. We went out a week ago with friends and I didn\u2019t have my card on me so he payed $120 for both of our tickets and he won\u2019t shut up about it. He keeps complaining that he paid for us and he can\u2019t afford it , even though I paid last months rent by myself because again he was short on money. So he kept on talking about it for this whole week and today I got upset and told him that as his wife sometimes I deserved to get a little spoiled and he doesn\u2019t have to count every $1 he spends on me. He kept saying it was a \u201cwaste\u201d of money. Yesterday, he spent money on whiskey with his friends he never complained about that or when he goes and spends money on bbq with his friends he never complains about that which I brought up. His excuse was that \u201cI have a social life of my own everything is not about you\u201d. He also said that he can\u2019t hang out with his friends and not spend money because it looks bad. That\u2019s when I got pissed off and told him that I am a beautiful woman who is also successful and independent I don\u2019t need to beg a man to spend money on me and if I went out there right now there would be a line of men who will be willing to spend more than $120 on me and he should appreciate me and value me because he is being cheap and just because I don\u2019t care about money doesn\u2019t mean he needs to disrespect me over $120 and call it a waste because it was spent on me ($60 was technically spent on himself and the other $60 on me). He said he ll block me everywhere which he did and told me he is not coming home or answering his phone because what I said was too much. So now I am wondering if I went too far since he is not making as much money as I do , maybe I should have been more understanding of his situation. AITA?\n\nEdit: I just want to add some more info, I don\u2019t make crazy amount of money or twice as much as him. I just make more than him but it\u2019s no where near making TWICE or something. Also, he always expects me to pay for both of us if he goes anywhere with me. This was the first time after a very very long time that he payed for us. I also help him financially if he ever needs anything (example I payed for last months rent by myself and covered his part, I never ask for money back because we are married and I don\u2019t want to count every penny that is being spent on him since I consider it to be OUR money which clearly he doesn\u2019t).\n\nEdit: SOMEONE asked me to add this detail I am 5 months pregnant \ud83e\udd30\ud83c\udffb", "created_utc": 1691351257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jyov1/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_he_is_a_cheap/", "score": 825, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m willing to bet you\u2019re the one who proposed to him lmao. \n\nAnd while i think it\u2019s ridiculous you chose to marry him, you did anyway.

Today, was the last straw where I really got pissed off. We went out a week ago with friends and I didn\u2019t have my card on me so he payed $120 for both of our tickets and he won\u2019t shut up about it. He keeps complaining that he payed for us and he can\u2019t afford it , even though I payed last months rent by myself because again he was short on money. So he kept on talking about it for this whole week and today I got upset and told him that as his wife sometimes I deserved to get a little spoiled and he doesn\u2019t have to count every $1 he spends on me. He kept saying it was a \u201cwaste\u201d of money. Yesterday, he spent money on whiskey with his friends he never complained about that or when he goes and spends money on bbq with his friends he never complains about that which I brought up. His excuse was that \u201cI have a social life of my own everything is not about you\u201d. He also said that he can\u2019t hang out with his friends and not spend money because it looks bad. That\u2019s when I got pissed off and told him that I am a beautiful woman who is also successful and independent I don\u2019t need to beg a man to spend money on me and if I went out there right now there would be a line of men who will be willing to spend more than $120 on me and he should appreciate me and value me because he is being cheap and just because I don\u2019t care about money doesn\u2019t mean he needs to disrespect me over $120 and call it a waste because it was spent on me ($60 was technically spent on himself and the other $60 on me). He said he ll block me everywhere which he did and told me he is not coming home or answering his phone because what I said was too much. So now I am wondering if I went too far since he is not making as much money as I do , maybe I should have been more understanding of his situation.

Because he has no intention if dealing with your actual complaint, \"Why do you care more about what your friends think than you care about how I feel?\"\n\nHe acts as if you said, \"I am the only one who should ever matter to you.\" (which would obviously be an unreasonable expectation). \n\nIt's an emotional manipulation where he misrepresents what you're saying in order to force you to defend yourself (and to turn the conversation away from what you wanted to discuss). \n\nThis all shows he isn't communicating with you in good faith.  When arguing about something, good faith means listening to the other person in order to understand what they are saying and being honest with them when sharing your perspective. \n\nHe's intentionally manipulating you to get what he wants without having to be honest about it.  This won't get better.  He isn't treating you with respect and he honestly doesn't care about what you want, feel, or need.  \n\nHe's always going to lie or manipulate when it makes things easier for him. He feels entitled to spend his money and time however he likes and he doesn't want to have to hear you complain about it.  \n\nSo when you do complain, he is going to act as if you have done something wrong and run away (abandoning ANY responsibilities and withdrawing affection).  He is always going to react to your complaints in a way that causes you even more grief than the behavior you complained about did. \n\nIn this way he trains you to just keep quiet when you're unhappy because none of the problems you try to address ever get better AND the process of addressing it/standing up for yourself is so awful it's just not worth it. \n\nSure, eventually he will try to act as if this argument never happened and maybe even give a half hearted apology if he thinks you might leave.

You literally just described my husband \ud83d\ude14 every single time I try to talk to him about an issue or something important it always makes him defensive and he turns it into an argument, the conversation devolves into mouth diarrhea every time. I am at my wits ends. I think I will screenshot this and have him read it. Maybe it will reach him somehow \ud83d\ude14", "Yes, that\u2019s exactly what my mom meant she always said that we should be able to support ourselves in case something happened to our spouse. She also said to never depend financially on a bf or even a friend , but now that we are married she realizes she never told us to financially depend on our husbands. She has been telling us that you have to let your husband spoil you sometimes it makes them and you feel good but it\u2019s too late now for me at least. \n\nAlso, I am sorry for all the stuff your mom has said I think she had low standards for herself and sounds like a a generational trauma. She probably came from a good place and thought that\u2019s the best any woman can do and I feel bad that she never realizes how good some men treat women.", "Oof", "Girl I read your other posts\u2026.

You have a walking, talking, extra utility.", "    He does not give a dang.  You are not on the same page financially.  Him blocking you is a huge red flag.  He is practicing financial abuse.  You are not required to stay with someone who treats you with such disdain, disrespect, and discourtesy.   Not ever.  \n\n  Perhaps you can stop wasting his time.

Also, he couldn't make rent last month but needs $120 back so urgently? And he is blocking you, his wife, everywhere at 33 yrs old??? There is so much wrong here, Im just not sure what else it indicates. Also you are pregnant, think about the division of finances and housework right now, will a child benefit from an overworked and financially exploited mom? Give him the chance through the pregnancy and even the 1st year of the child's life after you've hopefully spoken, attended therapy, or adjusted to a true 50/50, but re evaluate and see whether this is really worth it long term.", "Nope just getting worse day by day", "He's not acting like a husband or a partner, more like a child or an escort. You & your child deserve better.  Listen to that inner voice you're hearing.", "He is off the charts selfish. You can do better OP.", "I could have written this. My husband was the same way. He could buy what he wanted, but whatever I needed was a waste of money. He once told me to just stay home so I won't spend money on gas for my car while he went out to eat with his friends the same day. I bought $10 of gas with a roll of quarters we had in a box under the bed. When I got out of the shower, he asked where the $10 in quarters went. I was floored. I didn't know he was keeping track of our rolled up change. He left the house because he was mad I wasted money on gas. \n\nOne of our biggest fights was over a vacuum cleaner I bought for our house. We lived here for a year with no vacuum. We still had the extra pieces of carpet in the corner from them installing it. He said it was a waste of money. I then asked him why we had an $80 universal remote control for the $2000 sound system to go with the $1000 TV? He didn't say anything after that. The vacuum was around $60.\n\nI asked for a divorce when he got mad at me for taking a class that cost $99. I told him I was taking it. When I got home , still excited that I met someone famous who taught the class, he said, \"Sure doesn't seem like it was worth $99.\" He zapped all the joy from me. After years of dealing with this, I was done. He begged me for one more chance and said he was going to change. He did and realized how much of an AH he was. \n\nHe grew up poor and never wanted to be poor again. We weren't poor. He was controlling because he said that he didn't like not having 100% control over our money because he was afraid I would make him poor again.", "Girl you deserve so much better. And you will find someone better.", "Nta It's okay to be done. You only get one life and I'm sure you don't want to raise a child with someone that would be so hurtful to their mother and would make you feel bad for needing formula. You're better off alone, you might as well be. You won't have some jerk making you feel bad all the time", "My first boyfriend was like this. It only gets worse from here. Leave his cheap ungrateful ass.", "Damn that sucks. If originally he wasn't this cheap and people change so drastically. I wonder what happend. You really gotta talk to him about this. This could potentially ruin a marriage. If nothing changes and this eats you inside, there is always an option to exit the relationship. But since he wasn't always like this maybe a wake-up call is all he needs to get him back on the right track. Those in the older generation always calls us snowflake for running away when times get hard. I still believe that we should fight for it to try to work things out but there are certain things that there is no point trying for. So I hope in your case it's not like that.", "I worked an extra job to take my then GF to Disneyland Paris. I told my friends I didn't have money to do things.

I hope mine changes too maybe I should do divorce scare as well. My husband behaves the same way, I am 5 months pregnant and I asked him to get a closet from ikea for our baby and he said it\u2019s a waste of money and how we don\u2019t need it blah blah, then I asked him where we would put our baby\u2019s clothes ? On the floor? Then he finally agreed and said okay. I also mentioned let\u2019s get him also a changing table that\u2019s when he flipped and said he didn\u2019t even want to get the closet now I am adding more stuff.

That's not fun. That's like him clocking in for work. \n\nI bet he acts like the perfect husband the moment you want to break up tho. He probably has some weird mommy issues where he doesn't want a real partner, but he doesn't want to be without a woman to take care of him. Funny how he gets you to pay him like that tho. It's so manipulative and one sided. \n\nYou are lonely and you crave a companion. Tell him you want to start dating bc you want to go out and have fun.", "Why are you having a baby with this guy?
