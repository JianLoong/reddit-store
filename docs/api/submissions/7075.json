Instead, look at it as no food is terrible, and everything is in moderation.   Show them the food pyramid and teach them how to fuel your body best.   So one of the things on the smaller table is sugar.  Something we should all eat in moderation.   For example, if you say they can have one sweet thing a day.   If they choose syrup for their pancakes in the morning, they will need to pass on a cookie or some other treat later in the day.   If they choose a soda to drink as their treat, all other drinks need water or milk for the rest of the day.", "ESH, but you more so..yes your MIL should respect your parenting but she's not wrong and you will end up causing food issues with your children and they'll end up learning how to sneak around and lie", "ESH. \n\nYou and your MIL are both right and also both wrong. \n\nYou are well-within your rights to decide how your kids should eat, especially while they're still young, and it's definitely a good thing to limit their sugar intake.

If they say they're not doing that, they're lying. \n\nYour MIL should respect your boundaries, but depending on how much they go over there and how often she's sneaking them candy, she's also not wrong that an occasional treat (if it is, in fact, truly occasional) won't hurt.", "NAH\n\nI don't either party here is the AH.  \n\nHowever, I do think you need to relax the boundary/rule.  I don't think this is a 'slippery slope' argument.  Allowing your ILs to give your kids store bought candy is ok in moderation.

It's a little tougher for me, as we are currently living with her for financial reasons, but my wife and I have similarly had to ask on many occasions not to give our son juice and candy all the time.  \n\nThere is a compromise you can make here.  There are \"treats\" you can request that would give her a chance to spoil her grand children without giving them too much sugar.  In our case, we chose to get smaller candies (smarties, dots, etc) that we have deemed small enough, and if given infrequently won't be too much sugar.  Likewise, when our son asks for \"juice\" we simply pour a small amount of powdered Pedialyte into his water bottle.  He gets a little extra flavor without a huge rush of sugar, and we can control the amount we add.  Other options could include fruit snacks, or fresh fruits (our little guy loves grapes, and I'm happy to let him eat them anytime he wants).  \n\nPoint is, there are options to let her spoil the kids without breaking your little/no sugar rule.\n\nOh, and NAH.

My mother, who for herself adds a shitload of sugar to shop-bought sweetened yoghurt and travels with a bag of sugar so she can keep this up on holidays,  claimed the kid wouldn't eat it without sugar, and with sugar, she lapped it up. Well, yes, of course she did. And now I feel I should have stood my ground, because that was the first in a long, long list of granny-knows-best.  \n\nWhen I was a baby, she would add sugar when I didn't want to eat my spinach.

They would give me sweets, make amazing snacks for me... Do you know what that did to me?

But you are delusional if you think you can keep your kids away from candy.  If your kids are in public school, they get candy at every classroom party.

Fast food wa a given on the regular as my parents thought it was nice to give as a privilege they never got to enjoy. Not blaming them nor do I hold hatred. Just a different mindset.\n\nWas obese until 28 lol.", "I agree they'll get to it. At the same time, I don't see kids who get a meal with dessert and homemade candy as being in a bubble or deprived. \n\nIt's best to start kids with a healthy diet first. That way they know the proper way of eating. Usually habits you create with children tend to stick with them most times. That's why it's important to be consistent. Based on the post, the major issue was preservatives in store bought candy. The kids get homemade candy. Homemade candy can taste much better depending on the cook. Regardless, it's not about the candy, it's about a boundary violation.", "I have a problem with my 7 month old being offered and given Pepsi. An infant doesn\u2019t need sugar or caffeine. My in-laws are welcome to drink whatever they\u2019d like.", "Wow you suck a**! Kids are going to be kids! Pretty sure your oldest ones have eaten candy at school or elsewhere before! But go off! YTA OP", "It feels like you\u2019re attempting to make some kind of point, since the ages are clearly listed as 10, 8, and 3.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sure this point will be just as well thought out as your earlier \u201ccandy is more addictive than heroin\u201d bit.", "Have you ever looked at ingredients lists? \n\nDo you know what you are looking at? \n\nBecause your logic is flawed. \n\nMost candy does not have alot of preservatives, because sugar, in fact, is a preservative. \n\nI just looked at ingredients for 4 different brands of hard candy and nor a single preservative was listed. \n\nA box mix of chocolate cake contains more preservatives and anti-clumping ingredients than most candy bars. \n\nWhole \"real\" foods are generally healthy than mass produced foods. But that goes for everything. A bowl of oatmeal in the am is healthier than a bowl of dry cereal and milk. \n\nEven regular white flour has ingredients added for preservation and nutrition. \n\nIn general we ingest more preservatives in our day to day diet than the occasional candy.", "Oh hun. My husband\u2019s mother was like you. Same sort of rules. He\u2019s 50 now and struggles to self-regulate because he learned early that any of the \u201cgood\u201d stuff (store bought sweets) had to be eaten quickly before mom found them or they\u2019d be tossed. He literally cannot open a package of cookies and tell himself \u201cI only need 3, it\u2019s okay, these will still be here tomorrow.\u201d because of the number his mother did on him with those rules.\n\nLook, you have good intentions and I get it but you really are going to do more long term harm than good by making this a hill to die on.", "Lmao there isn\u2019t even a significant problem with eating something with preservatives. Also this type of control will back fire when they have control over what they eat.", "Well, I love to cook so if you were my DIL, those kids would be having baking fests with me.  Cookies, fudge, truffles, caramels, even marshmallows (although I hate them).  I would even try my had at homemade lollipops. Be careful what you wish for.....", "Agreed, and I know people think I'm being pedantic, but it annoys me so much! Everything is a chemical folks! Stop using the word to scaremonger.", "Citric acid is in A LOT of things. It's good for a lot of stuff!", "It's NOT a preservative, but OK. Also, explain how HFCS is worse than other types of sugar delivery. There has been SO MUCH debate over that. I'm no food scientist but I'll trust scientists in general over the hand wringing public.", "Be careful! I've heard they're putting dihydrogen monoxide in your water pipes!", "That\u2019s always have been my approach - to state a rule and also explain why.", "Candy isn't necessary for development nor is it recommended or nutritionally beneficial. The kids are young enough to not notice. When they get to middle school, that'll change.  Research on candy is available online. You can Google it. Including the preservatives that are cancer causing and banned in some countries. Why argue about something researchable?\n\nThe children are at an age where they can live without candy. Also, the parent said, they give the kids homemade candy. They also said, desserts are fine. The grandmother gives them desserts that includes cookies and cakes. Why does she need to give them candy on top of that anyway? Especially, when the parents explicitly asked them not too. If the parents give them homemade candy why can't the grandmother do the same? \n\n In all, the issue is about boundaries. It doesn't matter whether the grandmother agrees with the decision or not. The parents made a rules and they should follow it. Like I said before, it's not about the candy. Their personal values don't have to agree with the grandmother or vice versa, the grandmother needs to learn not to violate their values.", "I just don't know how to explain it in English as I'm not very good with the language. We live in Argentina and if you look at the ingredients of candies here all of them have lots of chemicals added that are not good for kids. But I do not know how they are called on English or what do you guys call them.", "See I'm from the American Midwest and I'm glad you explained because we call anything that tastes sugary a sweet. Anything from cookies to hard candy.", "Your right it\u2019s no different than sugar.  I guess because it\u2019s so cheap they put it in everything and that\u2019s bad.  But in this case it\u2019s the same.", "Also, if you can find it: Moser Roth :)", "Sorry, your big point was \u201ccandy gives cancer\u201d? Like really really? I was right, it was on the same level as \u201csugar is like heroin\u201d. Good job", "Sugar is not a drug. Something being addictive does not make it a drug. Everything can be addictive. Video game addiction is addictive due to the same mechanism as sugar addiction, but is not a drug. Things can be addictive that aren\u2019t drugs (video games, sex, self harm, gambling), and many drugs don\u2019t necessarily have the same addictive mechanisms as drugs such as alcohol or opioids. \n\nGlucose is not synthesised from carbohydrates. Polysaccharides, a type of carbohydrate, are broken down into their component sugars. A common polysaccharide is amylose (broken down by amylase) which breaks down into maltose, a disaccharide made of two glucose molecules which is further broken down into glucose. Sucrose, the form of sugar we find in bags of sugar, is a disaccharide made of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule, which is broken down into glucose and fructose. The word fructose should be reminding you of fruit, because sucrose which contains fructose is the type of sugar found in fruits and vegetables. Eating fruits and vegetables is not bad for you despite containing fructose, they just need to be eaten in moderation. \n\nWhen I say sugar is a necessary part of the diet, I am referring to the fact that without sugar we would die. If we cut out all sugar from our diet, our body would not be able to access stores quick enough to supply the demand. No sugar in the diet, we die. And we die pretty quickly. That is not to say that *refined* sugar is necessary, but as I\u2019ve just explained, the problem with refined sugar is not that the sugar is inherently bad for you, it\u2019s simply a lot harder to eat in moderation when you\u2019re eating artificially inflated amounts. When you eat an apple the sugar you are consuming is chemically identical to the refined sugar that you can buy at the supermarket, it\u2019s just that it has been isolated. \n\nSugar is, again, not a drug. Being potentially addictive does not make something a drug.\n\nChildren can be reasoned with, but you have to have a good reason. \u201cEat this and you\u2019ll die\u201d is a good reason to cut something out completely. \u201cEat too much of this over many years and your health will decline\u201d is not a good reason to cut something out completely.", "Do you plan on travelling overseas cause I've got some bad news to tell you: a lot of candies \u2014 or food for that matter from around the world \u2014 have preservatives in them. Not all are inherently bad or harmful for your children. Just like how people hold on to the belief that natural is always better. It's a fallacy.", "Ingredients tend to be very easy to translate into other languages. Try to tell us.", "Yep, that\u2019s one of our favorites :)", "Refined sugar is quite bad for you not just because there's a lot of it in sweet products, simply because it's far more accessible for your organism to break down like you said, so much so that candies begin their break down in mouth (saliva contains amylose), making your blood sugar level bounce up rapidly and rapidly collapse, since it's a disaccharide and it doesn't take long to break down all of it. Plus candy doesn't bring anything but sugar, in contrast fruits and vegetables bring you vitamins, minerals, fats even, depending what you eat \n\nAnd I'm not saying to cut sugar out completely, unfortunately in nowadays sugar addicted society that's impossible. Almost everything you buy in a convenience store has added sugar even if it doesn't taste sweet. Eating mainly homemade sweets with regulated sugar addition is a perfectly fine solution compared to sugar bombed sweets you'd buy in a store, containing as little as 16% and all the way up to 50% sugar", "I\u2019m aware that sugar needs to be consumed in moderation. Never suggested there are no problems with eating as much as you want. In fact my entire point has been about it isn\u2019t. \n\nIf you cut sugar out completely you\u2019ll die. That\u2019s not a sign of sugar addiction. That\u2019s a sign of being an organism that relies on glucose to function. You\u2019re starting to sound like that fucker from mad max.", "Then I'm not sure I still understand where your point was, if both of us agree sugar needs to be moderated \n\nYou won't die if you consume 0 sugar, keto diet exists. Like I said, glucose can be synthesised from fats and glucose is not the only energy source. Yes, it's not optimal and you shouldn't do it unless you're told to do so by your doctor, but like I said you won't die, it's just bad for a perfectly fine person\n\nI've no clue who you mean"]}
