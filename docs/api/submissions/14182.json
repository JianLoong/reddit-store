My immediate family have no issues talking about it freely in the house and have encouraged me to do so since I got my period. The house is made up of mostly women so this is expected.\n\nThe issue arose when my uncle came round a few days ago. Usually, guests use our downstairs bathroom due to it being easier and quicker to reach. This toilet has a small set of drawers filled with the sanitary essentials for both men and women and are usually out of sight as to not clutter the already small room. However, I\u2019m assuming my mum or someone else was in that toilet at the time so my uncle had to use the one upstairs. I was in the kitchen when he came back down to the living room and overheard him talking about how \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cdisrespectful\u201d having sanitary products \u201con display\u201d is. For most of my time having periods, I\u2019ve been very firm with my beliefs that periods are not something women should be shunned for or ridiculed for. Apparently my uncle feels differently. I walked into the living room and my uncles attention goes to me (context: my parents have an en suite they usually use and my sister keeps sanitary products in her room because she travels a lot and it\u2019s easier to just keep them in the bag so she doesn\u2019t forget them.) He starts berating me for having those products (pads, panty liners and baby wipes) \u201con display\u201d I would like to say that the majority of these products are in wicker drawers next to the sink with the panty liners being in a box by the wall next to it. Here\u2019s how that conversation went in a shortened version:\n\nMe: They aren\u2019t on display they are just in an easy place to reach.\n\nUncle: they shouldn\u2019t be out at all. it\u2019s gross and disrespectful to guests.\n\nMe: well when you start bleeding every month, then you can tell me what to do with my period products.\n\nHe then got mad and left the house 30 minutes later and now my parents said i was rude and should apologise.
