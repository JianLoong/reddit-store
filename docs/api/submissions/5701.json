Our subscriber base has hit 5 million members! I know that is nowhere near close to the most, but the 2022 Reddit Recap said that this little slice of the internet was the most-visited sub on the site! AITA gained over 1.5 million members alone last year, growing 44%! \n\nu/Flignir, created the sub nine years ago, when he had a question that he couldn\u2019t find the right home for elsewhere on Reddit. Sadly, you won\u2019t find it if you search the sub at this point. It\u2019s been lost to the void of the internet. However, Flig has told the story in interviews and podcasts before. A quick recap of the first post from the man himself:\n\n> *I was asking about whether or not I would be considered the asshole for something I was thinking about saying so it was actually a WIBTA.*\n\n>*I was working in a formal office and I wanted the air conditioning at 70\u00b0 or 72\u00b0 and one woman who worked there wanted it at 78 or so. I was stuck in a suit and she usually wore small skirts, light blouses, and open toed shoes. I wondered if it would make me the asshole if I just said \u201cwear a sweater\u201d and kept the A/C at 72\u00b0*\n\nFlig said he had one response and while sub rules have certainly evolved since then, the safest way to say it was the verdict was YWNBTA.\n\nOur January Monthly Forum will highlight our botmaster, u/Phteven_J. However, it\u2019s worth noting here that it became very apparent when the subscriber count hit 250,000 that the sub needed a bot to help out with the growing demands to moderate the sub. Phteven popped up, volunteering his services. He\u2019s been with the sub for the past four years, and has never asked for a single dime for his contributions. \n\nSome interesting stats about the sub:\n\n* In 2022, AITA had an astounding 6.7 *billion* page views. That\u2019s up 2.3 billion from 2021.\n\n* Most users view the sub on iOS, with Android being a close second.\n\n* Not surprisingly, very few use Old Reddit to view the sub. And most of those are probably your mod team (we have to use Old for now to moderate).\n\nOver the last 30 days, our sub has seen the following:\n\n- 20,000 posts published\n\n- 1.9 million comments published\n\n- Over 338 million pageviews last month\n\n- May was the busiest month of 2022, with over 673 million pageviews\n\nThank you to all our readers, posters, and commenters for helping make this sub the place for people to visit when they want to know if they were the asshole in a situation! We\u2019ve seen all kinds of posts, from the light-hearted to some pretty serious topics. We\u2019ve seen posts with a clear consensus and some with significant disagreement - we even created r/AITAFiltered for those! We\u2019ve had some good Updates, and some great Talks. What were some of your favorite moments in the journey here? \n\n[Here\u2019s to the next 5 million!](https://media.giphy.com/media/nDMyoNRkCesJdZAuuL/giphy-downsized-large.gif)", "created_utc": 1672086111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvvwln/i_woke_up_to_5_million_assholes_in_my_stocking/", "score": 518, "replies": ["I just started reading this sub a month ago when my wife posted something that concluded I was the asshole.

I'm a little sad to not see the comments from normies (Facebookers) on those ones. \n\nThat's my second game, if they only read the headline and comment. It's entertaining. \n\nI'm bored sometimes, don't judge me (I say on a judgment sub)!", "Thanks!!!!", "This sub has brought me lots of joy.
