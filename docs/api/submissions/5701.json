Our subscriber base has hit 5 million members! I know that is nowhere near close to the most, but the 2022 Reddit Recap said that this little slice of the internet was the most-visited sub on the site! AITA gained over 1.5 million members alone last year, growing 44%! \n\nu/Flignir, created the sub nine years ago, when he had a question that he couldn\u2019t find the right home for elsewhere on Reddit. Sadly, you won\u2019t find it if you search the sub at this point. It\u2019s been lost to the void of the internet. However, Flig has told the story in interviews and podcasts before. A quick recap of the first post from the man himself:\n\n> *I was asking about whether or not I would be considered the asshole for something I was thinking about saying so it was actually a WIBTA.*\n\n>*I was working in a formal office and I wanted the air conditioning at 70\u00b0 or 72\u00b0 and one woman who worked there wanted it at 78 or so. I was stuck in a suit and she usually wore small skirts, light blouses, and open toed shoes. I wondered if it would make me the asshole if I just said \u201cwear a sweater\u201d and kept the A/C at 72\u00b0*\n\nFlig said he had one response and while sub rules have certainly evolved since then, the safest way to say it was the verdict was YWNBTA.\n\nOur January Monthly Forum will highlight our botmaster, u/Phteven_J. However, it\u2019s worth noting here that it became very apparent when the subscriber count hit 250,000 that the sub needed a bot to help out with the growing demands to moderate the sub. Phteven popped up, volunteering his services. He\u2019s been with the sub for the past four years, and has never asked for a single dime for his contributions. \n\nSome interesting stats about the sub:\n\n* In 2022, AITA had an astounding 6.7 *billion* page views. That\u2019s up 2.3 billion from 2021.\n\n* Most users view the sub on iOS, with Android being a close second.\n\n* Not surprisingly, very few use Old Reddit to view the sub. And most of those are probably your mod team (we have to use Old for now to moderate).\n\nOver the last 30 days, our sub has seen the following:\n\n- 20,000 posts published\n\n- 1.9 million comments published\n\n- Over 338 million pageviews last month\n\n- May was the busiest month of 2022, with over 673 million pageviews\n\nThank you to all our readers, posters, and commenters for helping make this sub the place for people to visit when they want to know if they were the asshole in a situation! We\u2019ve seen all kinds of posts, from the light-hearted to some pretty serious topics. We\u2019ve seen posts with a clear consensus and some with significant disagreement - we even created r/AITAFiltered for those! We\u2019ve had some good Updates, and some great Talks. What were some of your favorite moments in the journey here? \n\n[Here\u2019s to the next 5 million!](https://media.giphy.com/media/nDMyoNRkCesJdZAuuL/giphy-downsized-large.gif)", "created_utc": 1672086111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvvwln/i_woke_up_to_5_million_assholes_in_my_stocking/", "score": 1184, "replies": ["I just started reading this sub a month ago when my wife posted something that concluded I was the asshole.

What were you an AH about?? :) And, welcome!", "Thanks!  I can\u2019t say it would ruin any post analysis / credibility lol !!", "Booooo\u2026and\u2026that\u2019s fair. Lol", "My fervent wish for the next year is that we can browse this sub without that goddamn OpEn iN rEdDiT aPp prompt. I will never download your app, Reddit!

Love this", "I still use RIF Is Fun (formerly Reddit Is Fun.) Clean, minimal interface with no bullshit.", "Welcome!", "Absolutely. Having 5 million assholes in you would make me go NC.", "So many marinara flags ...", "Yay count me into the fray; I joined earlier this year and never looked back TY!", "I make it a game, I read AITA posts and tell my wife the odds if they will pop up on Takei's page. \n\nI'm really good at it, but some I was surprised didn't make the cut. I'm a little sad to not see the comments from normies (Facebookers) on those ones. \n\nThat's my second game, if they only read the headline and comment. It's entertaining. \n\nI'm bored sometimes, don't judge me (I say on a judgment sub)!", "Thanks!!!!", "This sub has brought me lots of joy.

I am home recovering from another surgery (10th) and have to stay home mostly - medicine caused immuno compromised.  This group has really helped.

SubReddit complete; everybody can go home now.", "To whom do I give the keys after locking up?", "NTA kudos to you", "As someone who can't handle the heat, I would also have voted YWNBTA.

Try not to hit a windshield.", "Thank you.", "This sub (and maybe my beloved children and dogs..but mostly this) got me through the pandemic.  No matter how awful a day felt, there was always someone who sharing their funny or awful story (schadenfreude at its finest).\n\nAnd the community!  Thank you to all the mods/botmasters/commenters for making this an amazing place.", "Idk why more people don't. I occasionally have to use the app for picture posts and it looks like cancer after 8 years of only RiF", "Love this sub for lots of reasons but the main two are these:\n\nIt's the one place in the world where you can ask a question and receive well thought out and respectful responses as well as valuable insight. Whether it's the bots, the moderators, the quality of people or a combo of all three, the opinion still stands. No where else have I ever seen that and it is very meaningful in such a negative world.\n\nSecondly, no other place that I can think of can you find such a variety of people, life circumstances, different walks of lives with a vast amount of countries of origin, race, ethnicity, etc. It's like Open Arm Welcome to the World to come on in, put your feet up and stay awhile.\n\nWhile it is of the utmost importance to remember these are real people with real stories, many of them often tragic, I think the explosion of popularity is a reflection of what a person can expect to find here. Even if the majority of responses find that an OP is indeed an A-Hole I don't ever remember seeing anything blatantly disrespectful or over the top.\n\nSo, that's my two cents for what it's worth \u263a\ufe0f I look forward to many more years of being a part of such an exceptionally well-rounded and awesome community of people.", "The yahoo articles being published about all the content have also drawn a new crowd. Not sure if it's legal for them to farm our content but it gives perspective on how people are finding the sub. It's all the new posts I read the night before or within days, so they likely are a subscriber here.\n\n\nMy entire family has taken on an AITA mentality for all our problems... so thanks for the sub. It has given me so many meaningful memories!!!", "The only reason so few people use old reddit is because the admins go out of their way to hide it from new users. It\u2019s still the best form of reddit despite that.", "A lot of old users have made the switch surprisingly. New reddit does a great job of mimicking the mobile experience so many people are used to.\n\nAnd this might be an unpopular opinion here, but RES is the only reason I prefer browsing on old to new. New has a lot of those necessary quality of life features baked in that RES provides. And the more features being added to new like images and gifs in comments I find myself more and more switching to new. \n\nAll that said, I'm a big fan of text focused reddit, and old is the GOAT for that. This is a bit tangential, [but there was a great article in the new yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2022-in-review/my-year-of-reddit-and-relaxation) that does a great job of identifying that text focus as being what makes reddit *reddit*.\n\n*edit - a line about RES [and a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/)", "I like how this sub is validating people for their own perspective and people can be praised even if they don\u2019t provide the full story."]}
