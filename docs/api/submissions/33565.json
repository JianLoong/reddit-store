NTA though.", "The bulbs are lily bulbs. Quite similar in structure to garlic bulbs, just larger.\n\nIt's hard to explain what a mess it is out there and why it's impossible to find everything. He's emptied out seven or eight large planters, and these are 11 gallon tubs. On top of that there are a dozen smaller pots he's thrown around.\n\nBasically, where there once was a small lawn it's now mud from one fence to the other, an inch or two deep, with debris everywhere from chewed up lights to broken plant pots, mixed in with roots and everything else.\n\nI'm going out there again later to see what I can find.", "I think it's incredibly easy to say \"hey, I planted bulbs in the garden that are toxic to dogs. They are in these areas.\" \n\nI'm not gonna argue. This is just my belief on the matter :)", "I did buy some fencing to try to keep him out of the flower beds. At that time he wasn't touching any of the pots.\n\nThe fencing lasted about a week before he destroyed that.\n\nThen he turned his attention to the pots and completely annihilated them.", "They were, but we did have an old dog at the time and he wasn't interested in the pots and bulbs at all.", "OP contributed to old dog's vet bills, but somehow RM had money to buy a puppy two days after the old dog died.\n\nRescues don't cost that much so there's hope she adopted the puppy. It's definitely not from an ethical breeder. Considering how \"good\" she's at training and being responsible for the pup, she unfortunately sounds like someone who would buy a puppy from a backyard breeder or a puppy mill.", "Unfortunately, it's a very small garden (35x13 feet). All fenced in. Just basically an oblong box. Most of the bulbs were shallow in the beds or in pots that he's already destroyed. It's all just a big muddy pile now so there's really nothing left to protect.", "There's nothing to fence off. It's a small oblong garden (what Americans would call a yard, so not just a flower bed or veggie patch but the whole space with a lawn, one flower bed, and pots and patio etc).\n\nIt's about 35x15 feet I would guess.\n\nThere's nothing left to save anyway, he's destroyed literally everything. There's one big stone pot with a Japanese Maple in it but I expect he'll rip that out in the next week or two now that I've cleaned up most of the other garbage.\n\nShe's not going to assist with anything.", ">I would honestly be having a word with the landlord\n\nUnfortunately the landlord is part of a family dynamic in this instance, and she's absolutely useless in this regard. This housemate (and another) are incapable of cleaning up after themselves and do nothing around the house. The landlord just lets it slide until things are in such a mess she has no choice to but to tell them to do the dishes.\n\nI try to keep out of it. I use what I need to use and clean up after myself.", "Your housemate is obviously not watching or playing with their puppy.  That is sad.  Bored dogs dig and destroy.", "Whatever you plant, plant it 1,5 meters above the ground from now pn.\n\nI am sorry- losing the work and joy you put into your garden is very rough.\n\nTry finding some joy in the puppy. They are idiots at that age, idiots with teeth, but they enjoy life and needs love.", "Seems like it's time to find a new housing arrangement. If she's going to let the dog chew up a garden, what about necessities like computer cables or stuff you need for work or school?", "Yeah, no one goes out into the garden with him. They just shut him out there for ten or twenty minutes and leave him to destroy things, then spend five minutes trying to persuade him back in the house with treats (because heaven forbid someone might have to walk ten feet from the door or do anything that might be considered exercise).", "Nta. Why did she get a PUPPY if she doesn\u2019t have the time/money to monitor it and get it trained properly?", "NTA. Dog owners are insufferable.", "It's a puppy. It will dig and chew if left unattended. Your housemate needs to monitor it. Some puppies can be very destructive and destroy everything. Maybe you should ask for m9ney to redo the garden as her dog destroyed it?", "Nta. If  your housemate doesn't have time to monitor a pet, then why get one at all? Especially a puppy?? It really sounds like she's just not fit to take care of an animal if she refuses to train it properly", "ETA - they need to watch the dog but puppies get into things and chew, so you need to puppy proof the house.", "NTA. The puppy wasn\u2019t even born when you brought the plants in, and I\u2019m guessing your housemate didn\u2019t consult everyone before bringing in an untrained puppy as the emotional support replacement for the dog he lost. His puppy, he needs to take responsibility for training it.", "If your housemate does not have time to supervise the dog then she should have gotten an adult dog that's already trained.\n\nNTA. It's not as though you deliberately planted toxic things to harm doggies, or even set up this garden *after* she got the dog.", "NTA she\u2019s a very inconsiderate person to get a puppy when she doesn\u2019t have time to train it and make everything puppy proofed", "NTA. Give her an itemized bill for the garden and don\u2019t ever help with the dog again. It\u2019s basically her child, she needs to watch it and raise it properly OR MAYBE DONT GET ONE.\n\nAlso, this won\u2019t be the last time that puppy destroys your stuff. My dogs have chewed up my shoes, undies, purse straps, presents wrapped under the tree, controllers, cables, lamp cords, any type of plastic dropped in the floor. Both dogs have peed and pooped on the couches and bed.\n\nMy dachshund loves to chew. We try our best to keep things up and away from her, but stuff happens. If she doesn\u2019t train the dog, it\u2019s gonna destroy a bunch of your stuff. Dogs NEED discipline and routine.\n\n\nAnything you don\u2019t want ruined you might wanna put in your room, & lock it up when you\u2019re not there.", "Puppies have to be supervised just like babies or toddlers- her saying she doesn\u2019t have time to monitor her puppy is irresponsible. Can you put some chicken wire fencing around the garden to keep him out? Also we have a friend who had to have a $2000 surgery bc their dog ate a part of a stuffed dog toy. If she\u2019s not watching him outside she probably isn\u2019t watching him inside either and probably shouldn\u2019t have a puppy.", "If she doesn\u2019t have time to monitor her dog when outside, she doesn\u2019t have time for a puppy.", "ESH.  If there\u2019s a dog in the household, you shouldn\u2019t have plants that are unsafe for dogs.   The dog should be kept out of the garden if it destroys things.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nI'm getting a puppy in late january and I have spent the last month crawling through the garden to make absolutely sure everything there is safe - and at the same time I will never leave him there unsupervised, even once he's perfectly trained.\nAs this is a shared space, it falls not only upon your shoulders to care for the garden and you honestly have the right to plant whatever the heck you want there. It's her duty to supervise and train her puppy when he's accessing a shared space. You're honestly the nicest and most understanding housemate one could ever hope for, neither reacting the way I would have if her puppy destroyed my work, nor even making her look for the bulbs as she should... you have been doing enough, way too much even.\nShe sounds like a person who should not have a dog if this is all the responsibility she can muster.", "Nta", "you need the NTA first or this comment counts as a YTA", "If she doesn't have time to train her dog she shouldn't have brought a puppy home. NTA\n\nShe should pay for her dog destroying your garden BTW.", "Every time you find the dog outside, put it in your friend's room and close/lock the door.", "Sorry to say that from 0 - 2 years the majority of young dogs will dig and chew everything in their orbit- they\u2019d need to be monitored 24/7 to prevent this.  As a gardener this can be massively frustrating- I\u2019d be going with pavers and pots if you have the energy to try again. Sorry about your garden, we feel your pain", "I'm glad to hear, I know some people literally just let pets go neglected when a roommate decides to be a shit pet owner", "Oh PHEW, thank you so much for clarifying. I was really worried about the dog.    \n\n\nGood luck! I really hope your roommate steps up and starts taking care of the dog and training it properly!", "I have a dog. When she was in her digging phases I watched her outside. Having a dog is the best, but it\u2019s a LOT of work.", "But apparently it's a shared gardening space. I'm still confused how the space is unable to be fenced off.", "at this point i'd put chicken wire across the entire surface of the garden anyway. not harmful to him and he can't dig through it (either to cause damage or to find pieces of broken bulb). he won't like it, though, and that might force her to give him a better outlet - she doesn't have to do anything right now, because he currently has a playpen complete with free deadly snacks provided.\n\nthen again, that may come across as spiteful. i have no problem being safely spiteful after my entire garden is destroyed and a puppy is almost poisoned by its owner's careless negligence, but i also don't live in your house and have to deal with your housemates so it might not work for you", "Why aren\u2019t you actively trying to move out?", "i don't know if OP lives in the UK, but it sounds like a similar setup to some properties there- the house having only a tiny yard (referred to as a 'garden'), which OP has added plants to. OP's housemate is basically just letting the pup out into the backyard unsupervised", "Sadly, an idiot puppy not trained will be an idiot adult dog."]}
