Our older siblings work and make their own money but not as much as Jim and I do. Jim and I work corporate and make much more money & our parents and siblings have always tried to micromanage our finances. Before we even worked we were the only ones they put pressure on to go to college while the same pressure was non existent towards our older siblings.\n\nOur 31f sister is married with kids but still demands we give her money because she's always running out and she uses the \"I have kids and I am in need of that money more than anyone else\" excuse. Our 29m brother barely contributes in the house and even when he does he makes a scene.\n\nSo Jim and I are basically the only ones who pay our own part in our house with no complaints. Jim is engaged, soon to be married and he tries to gather money to move out with his fianc\u00e9e. He's got a raise in his job and makes a lot of money but hadn't told our parents and siblings that because he knows they'd try to micromanage him again so he keeps his actual earnings a secret and whenever our parents and siblings ask he just tells them a fake amount.\n\nYesterday during dinner, Jim sat next to 29m brother and at some point Jim's fianc\u00e9e texted him to send her some money she needed for a purchase they had to make. So he opened his bank's app to send his fianc\u00e9e the money and 29m saw the amount of money on Jim's account and called him out for hiding his savings and actual salary.\n\nThey then demanded of him to give them a huge amount of that money so they can cover their own expenses and depts because they refuse to save up their own money. Jim said no because that money is for him and his fianc\u00e9e to move out and plan their wedding. They fought back and forth about it and I stepped in to defend Jim and said that since Jim is contributing his part in our house then our parents and siblings are not entitled to a penny more than that and Jim has the right to keep his finances private. After all he's worked his ass off for that money and they don't deserve anything more than what he already contributes. I also blamed them for their shitty financial situations because most of their depts are because of silly and easy to avoid choices and not because of some unfortunate situations (long story that one but their dept is not regular dept people have because of poverty but because of poor choices and bad money management plus some scams on top of it).\n\nThey implied Jim and I are TAs for thinking its ok to abandon family when they're in need.

Like since she is still unmarried, her income is used for the benefit of the whole family just like her parents income. I was still surprised because I wasn\u2019t raised with that system, but she explained it\u2019s a holdover from when they used to have inter generational households. Everyone pooled money to benefit the family, everyone pitched in to lessen burdens. So my dad had helped pay for his brothers\u2019 educations, my uncle would make sure all his siblings knew how to do their homework (parents not that educated), and so on, all to make sure that everyone ended up in a better spot than they were in before. But there\u2019s a weakness in the system in that it doesn\u2019t account for shady, selfish people. One brother only pretended to go to college and used the money my dad had gone hungry at times to save to party with friends. My grandfather\u2019s brother actually kicked dad\u2019s entire family out of the family home when he got greedy because he was trusted to handle all the legal documents and moved all assets under his name.

I think the only way is to cut them off entirely for a year more (and go NC!) they have to learn to survive without leeching off of you. You have or will have your own families to support and they will drain you dry your whole life if you don\u2019t learn to stop this now", "Their nervous breakdown is their own reaction to their leechy ways. Get out ASAP!!! Make sure your family has NO ACCESS to your accounts. How did they get a view of the amount? That is strange???? Have your brother put that money in a different account and empty the one they are trying to access. Be sure his documents are safe and lock down his Social Security to make sure they don't take out credit in your brother's name. Protect yourself. These people feel \"entitled\" to your money. Be sure to correct them on that assumption as you have already stated to them. Protect those assets. Gawd, what entitled leeches. NTA", "Then don't tell them. Go look at apartments and then on the day your supposed to move out move out. This is a very dysfunctional situation that both of you need to get out from under.

I reply from my background which belongs to modern, western thinking. \n\nIf these cultural factors are still in place for someone living in my world, I think they should liberate themselves from them, since they are going to lose out. Time is not on the side of these systems, and young people supporting their parents and siblings today cannot expect their own children to do the same for them.", "This.

Sorry, your comment said \u201cI simply don\u2019t get it\u201d and I thought I\u2019d share something interesting I\u2019d heard about it in the past.
