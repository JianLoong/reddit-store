It's completely reasonable for you to want to draw boundaries and not do extra work that you're not comfortable with, especially if it involves taking on someone else's liability.

When my daughter was about 9 I did it without even thinking and she looked at me and said \u201cdidn\u2019t you tell me you hated this as a kid\u201d I was fucking mortified I had turned into my mother. Needless to say I paid her triple to do that one favor and did not do again and she still laughs about it at 21 about how she got her idiot mother to give her so much guilt money.
