I told her I didn\u2019t get an RSVP from her, so I didn\u2019t send her a cancellation notice.

You made the responsible decision to postpone the party due to your daughter's illness and informed the guests who had RSVP'd. You also showed kindness to your friend who arrived late and allowed her to see your daughter and deliver the gift. It is not fair for your friend to accuse you of racism without any evidence or reason to do so, especially since you didn't receive an RSVP from her. It's important to communicate and address any concerns or issues, but unfounded accusations and threats to end a friendship are not productive. Therefore, NTA", "Lol. NTA.\n\n She went to your house, saw your sick kid, saw that there weren't any other kids there and still proceeded to call you racist?  She just wants to play victim.  FYI I'm a POC. \n\n\nBesides that, how would you have known who was actually going to go to the party if only a Few RSVPd", "NTA. Maybe she has no clue about rsvp's. I'd be sure to let her know there were 11 invites, 4 rsvps & 4 postponements, because lack of rsvp = not on the guest list & why would you tell someone who was not coming anyway not to come?", "She really said that? You don't seem like the one with the problem, but it is such a weird response from the other mum. Ynta", "Makes no sense to send a cancelation notice to people who didn't say they were coming. You didn't send it to the other 6 invitees, right?  \n\nAnd coming to a sleepover without bothering to RSVP is so rude! You didn't blame her race for that, did you? Woman saw a conclusion and she jumped. \n\nNTA", "Failing to RSVP means you might not have had enough food or favors. Trying to drop their kid off without RSVPing makes them an automatic AH. You don't need to send cancelations to people that didn't RSVP. NTA.", "Nta - you didn\u2019t send her the cancellation because in your opinion she wasn\u2019t coming. Race has nothing to do with it, it\u2019s all about her bad manners", "Nta. How rude of this woman showing up after not responding and an hour late. She was waiting to see it anything else was coming up the would be fun for her and have you to babysit. Dont let her pull the race card, she only played it because you embarrassed  her for not having rsvp'd", "Based on what you've said NTA. Why would you tell someone who hasn't told you they're coming to not come? Assuming they aren't coming off they haven't bothered to RSVP is perfectly reasonable. Not sure how they managed to leap to you being racist.", "NTA, I don't think I'd want to be friends with her. No need to walk on eggshells because someone might call you racist when they didn't even bother with a simple rsvp.", "NTA. Why is it so hard for people to understand the concept and consideration of an RSVP?! A simple yes or no is all that's required. Your reasoning is sound. Tell her she's welcome to check with all the other yahoos who couldn't be bothered with basic etiquette to see she was treated no differently than the rest of that special group. Edited for clarity.", "NTA. If she had RSVPed, she would also have gotten a cancellation notice. How are you supposed to know to call her if you didn't know they are coming? There is nothing racist about the situation. Poor communication on the mother's part is to blame.", "Yikes. But NTA.\n\nThat's a major leap of her part. But I'd ask a few more questions first - confirm with the mom that she hadn't RSVP'd or was under the impression that her daughter had RSVP'd by saying yes to your daughter (who forgot to pass the message along to you).\n\nSo you say to the mom - \"Hey there, really sorry again about the confusion - I had only sent the cancellation to the girls I knew was coming and I hadn't seen an RSVP yes for your daughter. I never heard back so i assumed you weren't able to come. Some other girls I also didnt hear from, didn't contact about the cancellation, but they also didn't show up.  Did I miss your RSVP somehow?\"\n\n(But also, was this girl the only black girl invited? And is that representative of your area or not? As in, if you invited 11 girls and 1 was black, is the % of black kids at your daughters school \\~10-20%? If your daughter's invite list of friends skews way off of the racial demographics of her school there may be something to look at there)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not your fault your daughter was sick and the party was postponed. She's bringing race into an Illness issue and needs to back off and relax. It's not like she saw a bunch of white girls giggling and hiding behind the couch waiting for them to leave so the party could resume. Her baseless accusation is ridiculous and probably going to work against her daughter having many friends if mom keeps that ridiculous behavior up. \n\nIf you don't RSVP, don't expect communications when plans change. You didn't even know she was coming. I'd have told her that unlike her, I don't give a damn about your race, and she's welcome to come to the party next week. I care more about her daughter not getting whatever nasty bug that infected your child.", "NTA - why would you inform someone who didn\u2019t rsvp to your party that you were cancelling it? That makes no sense.", "NTA\n\nThis adult didn\u2019t RSVP\u2026.

You aren\u2019t the AH, I would have called everyone for those who forget to RSVP. I think the other Mom was out of line now this is only me because I feel bad for everything would have apologized and said I should\u2019ve called everyone but I only got so many RSVP\u2019s. Maybe my daughter didn\u2019t tell me because she forgot and was getting sick. I promise we love Grace (made up name) and April really loves being friends and playing with her. I in no way meant to hurt anyone\u2019s feelings. I have 4 other moms I haven\u2019t called (little white lie unless it was true) I will call them also.

Somebody showed up without an RSVP, and an hour late at that. She was given a valid reason for there not being a party, which also should\u2019ve been corroborated by the lack of additional cars.", "The main issue is that she was called racist.  But I guess you missed that.  Like I said, as a POC I can understand the black moms thought process.

How does racism factor there?\n\nAnd you need to stop making assumptions about me, because you have no idea who I am.  For starters, your assumptions about me have been wrong so far.", "If you say so", "Explain how it\u2019s reasonable for a person of color to think the OP was racist.", "Huh? Did I say OP is racist?  Lol, you think you're commenting stuff of value but you're literally talking in circles and saying absolutely nothing. Bye bye. \ud83d\udc4b", "Huh? Did I say OP was racist?  You act like you\u2019re knowledgeable because you claim to be a person of color, which I doubt. \n\nYou said you understand the woman\u2019s thought process, because you\u2019re a person of color. That basically justifies why she thought there was racism. When I asked you to explain it, you clap back with some snark."]}
