He\u2019s been very sick with various cancers for awhile, and from time to time the topic has come up between us about what will happen to his mom once his dad is gone. I\u2019ve been very firm in the stance that I have no interest in living with a grown adult who is more than capable of looking after herself.\n\nHere\u2019s why; My bf and I have been together for five years. In five years I met his parents once despite the fact they live only two hours away. This is because his parents are drug addicts, drunks, and dad was a previous drug dealer. They lost custody of my bf in his teen years when another family member stepped in to fight for full-time custody. My bf was being neglected and abused.\n\nHis mom had left and divorced his dad when my bf was a young child. She lived with family, sort of got her life together, got a diploma and a job. She ended up quitting work, taking all her kids and heading back to bf\u2019s dad and they\u2019ve been together since. She was never really a true parent and neither was dad. They rarely called, if ever, and would even forget birthdays. Despite many attempts, they always had an excuse why they couldn\u2019t visit for the holidays, which really disappointed my boyfriend. They\u2019re terrible parents truly.\n\nThe one time I ever met them was something I don\u2019t even have words for. Their house was so disgusting, so dirty and filled with hoarded items that we had to sit outside on a picnic table while mom smoked and chatted. I had to use the washroom and it was least to say traumatizing. The entire floor was covered with items and dirt. The shower was filled with clothing like a laundry hamper. The toilet was covered in feces, the sinks were filled with shit. I have honestly never seen a home so disgusting in my life. Everything my boyfriend tells me about them, the lack of relationship with their entire family has left a really bad taste in my mouth. I have zero interest in building a relationship with his mom.\n\nNow Dad has died suddenly. My boyfriend wants his mom to come stay with us. He expects my teenager to clean up his room and give it up for an undetermined amount of time, minimum a week, past Christmas, so that his mom can use the room.\n\nI don\u2019t know this lady at all. She\u2019s a stranger to me. She abandoned her child for a certain lifestyle so I don\u2019t really feel like I owe her anything, let alone staying weeks in my home. I know nothing about her. I know she\u2019s had a rough life so I have empathy for her, but I too understand what it\u2019s like to rise above adversity, something she\u2019s chosen not to do despite all the help that\u2019s been offered to her.\n\nMy bf is now upset with me because I\u2019m upset this stranger is supposed to come stay here, during my first 2 weeks off in an entire year, during Christmas holidays. I just don\u2019t see why we need to look after her when she couldn\u2019t even look after my boyfriend.

And if you agree to letting her stay for \u201c only a week/few weeks\u201d do you really believe she will leave after that? There will likely be excuse after excuse as to why she can\u2019t leave , such as the filthy hoarder house, her age, loneliness, to having nowhere else to go ect. Once you let her in, she\u2019s not leaving. Put your foot down now, it\u2019s your house too, and you kid shouldn\u2019t be displaced permanently for his crap mum. Good luck with this.", "NTA. This is a case where you need to stand firm. Having somebody move in is a two yes or one no thing.\n\nYou have had nothing to do with her for years. That a good thing and should continue. If you allow her to move in, she will never leave, and you''ll be paying for her for the rest of her life.\n\nDon't let your bf do more for her than she ever did for him.", "NTA. If you don't want her there, then she shouldn't be there. What's scary is that you go 50/50 on your home with a boyfriend, and that opens you up to some trouble if he decides to move his mother in without your approval. She won't ever leave if she gets her foot in the door, so keep that in mind.", "NTA she'll never leave", "NTA Whatsoever!", "NTA, she would not leave and there is no requirement for you to share a house with someone who has already shown to you the kind of lifestyle she leads.", "This is a situation that takes 2 yeses", "NTA. \n\nAnd you know damn well if she stays she's not ever leaving.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let her get her foot in the door- she\u2019ll never leave and you\u2019ll be stuck dealing with her dysfunctional lifestyle. Not to mention your teenager deserves stability and not to have their entire life uprooted. You aren\u2019t even married to this guy and he\u2019s expecting you to help take care of his mother indefinitely (who you don\u2019t even know) and mess up your child\u2019s life at the same time. Stand firm and say absolutely f\u2019n not!!!! If he isn\u2019t willing to see reason then I would rethink the entire relationship. Put your child first and get the hell out of there if he refuses or his mother shows up without your agreement.", "Nta, your boyfriend is fucking wrong as hell for wanting to make you deal with someone who left shit on their toilet", "NTA. But if you allow this stranger to invade your home and your son's life you certainly will be. Hard no, this should be a deal breaker. It will destroy your relationship and your peace of mind, not to mention the possibility of losing your valuables. Not your circus, not your monkeys. Don't give in.", "NTA nope.", "NTA! This is a hard no. He can pay for her to have a hotel room. You can offer to pick up and drive her back and forth to hotel. YOUR home is YOUR home. SANCTUARY. The number of people who expect this to be given over for convenience blows my mind. NOPE NOPE NOPE. Not happening. Period. He can go stay in the hotel room with her if he wants to. They can bond. (This won\u2019t happen and he\u2019ll see how disgusting she is there too.) no no no no no no no no", "NTA especially when he wants you to kick your son out of his room - this may be relationship ending though. I\u2019d tell him your son is not giving up his room and if he wishes to house his mother he will have to do so elsewhere even if it means the end of your relationship.", "Whoa big red flag if that happens she'll never leave and kid won't ever get his room back and that will strain the love", "NTA and do not let this person into your house, she will never leave.", "Good Lord, stand your ground.\n\nExplain to your husband that his mother lives in a hygienically toxic manner and you refuse to cohabit with her for any length of time.\n\nAnd stick to that. If he insists, move out.", "NTA. It actually doesn\u2019t matter whether she did or didn\u2019t take care of your BF. You don\u2019t want her living with you. That\u2019s the end of it. And no, do not kick your kid out of his room, so your BF\u2019s walking disaster of a mother can come and destroy your home. That would be a bad idea.", "NTA. It sounds like she isn't really family to her own son, let alone to you.", "I would not allow someone with this history to share a home with my minor child, to be honest. To begin with, her hoarded possessions would very likely be infested with vermin of various sorts, which would infest my home, even after she left.\n\n Second, her level of uncleanliness likely results from behaviors and habits she would be engaging in, within my home, which would make it difficult if not impossible to keep my home in a hygeinic state. It sounds unlikely, for example, that she would clean feces off of a toilet she used. That means you'd have to do it. Or your teenager would have to do it. Would you be ok with that? I would not. \n\nLast but not least, is she still addicted to drugs? If she is, or if there is even a shadow of a thought that she is, I think it would be really irresponsible for you to allow her to share a home with your teenage child. Just the presence of illegal materials, the legal risk to you if you know you have those materials in your home, the risk your child might develop the idea that it's ok to use drugs because grandma does it, your child's possible access to drugs. The risk of your child being removed from your home by child protective services because of the presence of a drug user in his home. \n\nIf you go read other posts here, allowing someone to move into your home can make it difficult to force them to move out again if they become a problem. Even if they don't pay any rent. You could just get yourself into a very sticky situation here. \n\nMy overriding idea here is I would have to protect the safety and hygiene of my child's home.", "I'm going to say NAH, depending on the circumstances. You have perfectly valid reasons to dislike her and to not want her living with you. But she is yr BF's mother and he obviously wants to care for her.\n\nIt might come down to who owns your living quarters. Do you own them? Do you rent? Who has the authority? If your name is on the lease/rental agreement/ownership you'd be able to deny that she could stay there. If it's his name on the documents, he would have the final say so. If it's jointly, you'd be at something of an impasse.\n\nYou have to decide how far you would take this. If he insists that his mother will be staying, is this something you would leave him over? Or would you be willing to kick him out over it? You don't say how old she is, but if you stay w/yr BF she's obviously still going to be in his life to some degree.", "INFO:  You split expenses 50/50 so he's paying half of your son's living expenses-- is that correct?  If that's indeed the case I can understand him feeling that having his mom come for 2 weeks is a perfectly reasonable ask.  (If you are actually paying more than 50/50 to cover your son then that's different.) \n\nCan you negotiate for a shorter amount of time -- say a long Christmas weekend OR could he spend Christmas at his mom's this year instead of her coming to your place?", "ESH. Your painting the picture as if you don't like her because of her relationship with your bf, when that's clearly not the case as exampled by the fact that your bf seems to have no problem moving her in. You look down on her because your find her disgusting. You find her & her addiction beneath you. I'm not saying you suck because of that, I won't judge. You do however suck for lying about it. I hate liars.   \n\nYour bf sucks because your son shouldn't have to give his room up to this woman. Especially when his partner has expressed they are against the entire thing. If he wants to help out his mother, he should do so by finding her other accommodations. I'm not saying he has to have the money to put her up in a hotel indefinitely,", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If it were the 90s it\u2019s a choice I would have never made. However, with the growing cost of housing and our need to move into a bigger home, I thought it would be financially the smartest decision, because if things didn\u2019t work out in the end, the equity gained would far out weigh the consequences of separating and selling, or waiting and paying excessive prices for a house. Our home has already appraised 150K over what we paid fortunately.", "That is one of my biggest concerns. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s in active addiction. As far as I know she really has nothing to her name. With her still being divorced, I would think most of his dads items and property would go to whoever it\u2019s willed to but they are technically common law by Canadian standard and I\u2019m not familiar with the law.\n\nLike is she going to drink my booze? Take my leftover weed? Rummage through my things? Take valuables? Make a huge mess? Cook? Clean up after herself?

I'm hoping your bf takes the opportunity to talk this out with a therapist.
