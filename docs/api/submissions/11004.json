The instant jump to \"slutshaming\" makes me think it's a part of their kink. Fine and good for them to do role play and get all kinky, but bringing it into a party involves everyone there in their kink without consent, and indeed despite the clear lack of consent.", "NTA, nobody cares if you have sex, but pet names, especially in that vein, are a kink, and plenty of people don\u2019t want kink in a public setting, it very much feels like they\u2019re projecting onto the people around them and getting off on the voyueristic nature of it all. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to feel like I was a part of that, you were not wrong for asking some mfs to act normal.", "NTA. Its pretty commonly considered that \u201cdaddy\u201d is kink specific and not just a cute pet name. By using it in a social setting they are pulling the people around them into their dynamic without consent. There are plenty of places that specifically exist where people are safe to play at scenes and dynamics without it being an issue for those around them. They need to do better, fake shit like this where they clearly haven\u2019t bothered to do their research and just wanna play 50 shades dress up makes the community look bad.", "NTA.

This kinda sounds like a kink and its not cool to subject others to your kinks without consent.", "NTA. They were including you and everyone else in their kink without consent. That's never ok. You weren't shaming anyone, you were politely asking them to stop since you were uncomfortable. They probably like to do stuff like this in front of others as part of their kink, but again, if they expect other people to participate, even just by watching or listening to it, then consent is required from all the participants. Always.", "NTA - If you just kicked her out without explaining this to her it\u2019d be different. But you told her she was making people uncomfortable and she didnt care.

Sounds like **someone** believes they are acting like one and it's not you.\n\nThen she started ranting and being a total AH.  She deserved to be booted from the party.

You didn\u2019t kick her out for calling her bf \u201cdaddy\u201d, you kicked her out because she started yelling at you in your own home when you politely asked her to stop using the nickname (of a potentially sexual nature) as it was making everyone uncomfortable.", "NTA \n\nShe needs to learn not to involuntarily involve people in her kink.", "NTA at all. If their kink effects others, even if that just means it\u2019s noticeable enough that it makes other uncomfortable, then it\u2019s something that others have to consent to.

You should have full authority on who is welcome.", "NTA if they\u2019re in a dynamic they\u2019re even bigger AH because bringing your relationship out into a group with out explicit consent from everyone there, then you keep it to yourself!", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who has a similar dynamic (albeit different names) in my relationship, honorific belong in private or in consenting spaces.", "NTA. There are different behavioral expectations that totally depend on the social gathering. They were obviously at the wrong social gathering.", "It's telling that she said not to slut-shame her. Almost as if she knew she was being slutty in the middle of a party.

But a group doesn\u2019t need to hear that kink constantly. I\u2019m not shaming anyone. Personally I find that kink weird. Totally weird. And I wouldn\u2019t want to hear it.

Multiple people felt uncomfortable by their deliberate behavior.  They were asked to stop while in a group social setting (this is likely a kink of theirs to do things in front of others) but refused.  Others not wanting to be around that behavior is reasonable and asking those doing it to stop would even be expected when others are not comfortable.  Even if everyone else there was fine with this, it is your party, your home and if you were uncomfortable that is enough right there.  Their response about slut shaming reinforces the point that this was sexual and purposeful by them as nothing in your write up of the situation would be slut shaming.  As for if you were kink shaming, I would say no since everyone there has a right not to be a participant to their personal kinks.  Asking them to stop while making others uncomfortable at a party is not shaming but just common decency.  They can go home open the front window blinds and put on their display for their neighbors and hope they do not have the cops called instead.", "I was gonna say yta based off the title but man she REALLY dragged it on.

Also have seen my friends do the same thing \n\nThe daddy thing though ? I am not a prude or anything , but as you said it was literally making the whole group uncomfortable.

It's about needing something to help with stress of life and other things like that. Yes it can and does involve sex for those who want it to but the whole thing is not about sex. But a NEED. Its about who the person is. So depending on the KINK it's like telling someone to not talk like that or they ate dressed wrong.
