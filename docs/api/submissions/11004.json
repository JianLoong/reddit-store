They brought you and all your other guests in to witness sexual behavior/speech you never consented to.  Whether it is a kink or not, that\u2019s not acceptable.  You even asked politely initially and they did not respect that boundary.  It would make most people uncomfortable to be around them because it\u2019s just weird.", "NTA. The instant jump to \"slutshaming\" makes me think it's a part of their kink. Fine and good for them to do role play and get all kinky, but bringing it into a party involves everyone there in their kink without consent, and indeed despite the clear lack of consent.", "NTA, nobody cares if you have sex, but pet names, especially in that vein, are a kink, and plenty of people don\u2019t want kink in a public setting, it very much feels like they\u2019re projecting onto the people around them and getting off on the voyueristic nature of it all. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to feel like I was a part of that, you were not wrong for asking some mfs to act normal.", "NTA. Its pretty commonly considered that \u201cdaddy\u201d is kink specific and not just a cute pet name. By using it in a social setting they are pulling the people around them into their dynamic without consent. There are plenty of places that specifically exist where people are safe to play at scenes and dynamics without it being an issue for those around them. They need to do better, fake shit like this where they clearly haven\u2019t bothered to do their research and just wanna play 50 shades dress up makes the community look bad.", "NTA. You asked her to tone it down and she started ranting at you. I would have asked them to leave as well", "NTA. This kinda sounds like a kink and its not cool to subject others to your kinks without consent.", "NTA. They were including you and everyone else in their kink without consent. That's never ok. You weren't shaming anyone, you were politely asking them to stop since you were uncomfortable. They probably like to do stuff like this in front of others as part of their kink, but again, if they expect other people to participate, even just by watching or listening to it, then consent is required from all the participants. Always.", "NTA - If you just kicked her out without explaining this to her it\u2019d be different. But you told her she was making people uncomfortable and she didnt care. She has to go.", "NTA.  is not a nickname, is a kink. kinks go to the bedroom, no in public.", "They knew what they were doing. I guarantee it was all part of an elaborate foreplay. NTA", "NTA. It's not slut shaming, it's the fact that nobody else consents to her kink.", "NTA.

You do not have to tolerate this.", "NTA\n\nThe girl failed at being a good **guest** at your party.  She was informed politely to save the pet names for home.  Then, she said you were slut-shaming her.  Interesting choice of thought from her, yes?    That she assumed your not liking the pet name \"daddy\" was slut-shaming?  Sounds like **someone** believes they are acting like one and it's not you.\n\nThen she started ranting and being a total AH.  She deserved to be booted from the party.

And yes, \"daddy\" to address a BF is just plain weird.", "NTA, although the title is misleading. You didn\u2019t kick her out for calling her bf \u201cdaddy\u201d, you kicked her out because she started yelling at you in your own home when you politely asked her to stop using the nickname (of a potentially sexual nature) as it was making everyone uncomfortable.", "NTA \n\nShe needs to learn not to involuntarily involve people in her kink.", "NTA at all. If their kink effects others, even if that just means it\u2019s noticeable enough that it makes other uncomfortable, then it\u2019s something that others have to consent to. They kept pushing it, you asked them to not and they didn\u2019t respect that so they can leave the group setting.", "NTA -- you gave them a chance to stop engaging in behavior that made you and others uncomfortable, and they escalated the situation.

I have some outspoken female friends who would not have been so dignified.", "NTA, she shouldn't have involved unwilling bystanders into her kinks, especially when repeatedly told that she was making people uncomfortable around her.\n\nPeople like this give the kink community a bad name.", "NTA It's your party at your home. You should have full authority on who is welcome.", "NTA if they\u2019re in a dynamic they\u2019re even bigger AH because bringing your relationship out into a group with out explicit consent from everyone there, then you keep it to yourself!", "NTA.\n\nAs someone who has a similar dynamic (albeit different names) in my relationship, honorific belong in private or in consenting spaces.", "NTA. There are different behavioral expectations that totally depend on the social gathering. They were obviously at the wrong social gathering.", "It's telling that she said not to slut-shame her. Almost as if she knew she was being slutty in the middle of a party. NTA.", "NTA, I would have kicked them out earlier tbh.", "NTA.   \nIt\u2019s more than a nickname if she\u2019s saying you are \u2018slut shaming\u2019 her, and people shouldn\u2019t force their kinks onto other people (who are not into it).", "\"But I call all my boyfriends daddy.\" - Trudy", "NTA, but daddy won't like it anyway", "NTA.

But a group doesn\u2019t need to hear that kink constantly. I\u2019m not shaming anyone. Personally I find that kink weird. Totally weird. And I wouldn\u2019t want to hear it. I find that term associated with a lot of abuse. Yet I don\u2019t find consensual Dom / Sub or anything weird.", "NTA. You explained your boundaries and they chose to ignore it.", "NTA.  Multiple people felt uncomfortable by their deliberate behavior.  They were asked to stop while in a group social setting (this is likely a kink of theirs to do things in front of others) but refused.  Others not wanting to be around that behavior is reasonable and asking those doing it to stop would even be expected when others are not comfortable.  Even if everyone else there was fine with this, it is your party, your home and if you were uncomfortable that is enough right there.  Their response about slut shaming reinforces the point that this was sexual and purposeful by them as nothing in your write up of the situation would be slut shaming.  As for if you were kink shaming, I would say no since everyone there has a right not to be a participant to their personal kinks.  Asking them to stop while making others uncomfortable at a party is not shaming but just common decency.  They can go home open the front window blinds and put on their display for their neighbors and hope they do not have the cops called instead.", "I was gonna say yta based off the title but man she REALLY dragged it on. A few times is fine and depending on the people you're with/activity you're doing imo but over and over and over is just incessant and just weird lol it was clearly making everyone uncomfortable \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Daddy isn't a pet name, it's a kink name. she also seems insecure.", "NTA \n\nI don't think it's weird she sat on his lap , I do that with my bf because I like being as close as I can to him . Also have seen my friends do the same thing \n\nThe daddy thing though ? I am not a prude or anything , but as you said it was literally making the whole group uncomfortable. There is a time and place for that stuff , that was not it", "NTA - you did everything right in this situation. you asked her nicely for a reasonable request and then asked her to leave when she repeatedly refused.

Absolutely. But I don\u2019t think it should have been an issue in the first place, and everyone side eyeing each other needs to quit being Judgy McJudgersons.\n\nEdit: I stand corrected. I still say AH level lies 75% with Couple, 25% with OP. But this is also a fine lesson in vetting people you invite into your home.

It's about needing something to help with stress of life and other things like that. Yes it can and does involve sex for those who want it to but the whole thing is not about sex. But a NEED.

So if I out do they still ask. Or just accept. \n\nIts like this. Hey your gay and I don't like it so please don't show you love each other.
