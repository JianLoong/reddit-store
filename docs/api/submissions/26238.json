In our culture, we have been raised to treat our guests with utmost respect. We are taught to respect, support and care for our parents; their presence is ALWAYS welcome. It isn\u2019t a 1950s subservient bang-maid scenario, but a result of utmost love and respect. It is basic courtesy for us to ask guests if they had their meal, how did it taste, did they sleep well. These are the most basic courtesies and quite normal for us. To understand the normalcy of it, as kids, we\u2019ve given up our room for guests to sleep and instead spent the night on the floor mattress. It\u2019s quite common and expected in most Indian households. \n\nMain post: \n\nMy husband (30M) and I (30F) have been together for almost 2 years, married for 10 months. \n\nHis parents had recently visited us for the first time and I went above and beyond to make them feel comfortable and welcome. MIL was extremely happy when they left, FIL shed a few tears since this was completely in contrast to how they\u2019ve been treated at elder BIL\u2019s home all these years. \nEven though I disagreed with my husband, I didn\u2019t argue  or talk back in front of his parents. I\u2019d wake up well before breakfast, lunch and dinner and serve and eat after everyone\u2019s finished. I even took up cleaning so he can spend more time with his parents.\n\n2 months later, my mom\u2019s visiting. While overall he\u2019s been nice, engaging and sweet, I still am doing all of the above. Last night, he was on Instagram but I ended up serving dinner and cleaning. He slept off early and while I was awake till 2 am since mom wanted to watch a movie, I woke up early to make breakfast. He woke up late, didn\u2019t ask my mom if she\u2019s even eaten and overall didn\u2019t bother. \n\nI was fuming, so when he said something about not waking him up for his gym, I retorted saying\u2014 \u201cWe\u2019re all responsible adults and since my mom\u2019s here I want to spend time with her instead.\u201d It was more of a taunt. \n\nHe didn\u2019t eat his breakfast, went in the room and closed the door saying he has work. My mom\u2019s asked me twice if he\u2019s upset. He\u2019s not come out of his room, it\u2019s been 3 hours. \n\nEdit 1: Re-read and removed \u201cAITA for asking him to wake up early when my mom\u2019s visiting?\u201d Since I was too angry while typing. The question is\u2014 \u201cAITA for expecting my husband to treat my mom the same way he does when his parents are around?\u201d\n\nEdit 2: We split our chores quite well and rarely argue over it. The point is not chores; it\u2019s empathy. When his parents were around I wouldn\u2019t even dream of sleeping in till late, throwing a tantrum by locking myself in a room and not extending them the basic courtesy of asking if they had food. I wouldn\u2019t dream of having an argument or snapping at him the way he\u2019s doing when my family\u2019s around. Moreover, I do not like airing our dirty laundry in front of family/friends visiting us for a few days.\n\nEdit 3: A lot of you have raised eyebrows about eating last. We have a food item called rotis. It almost works like a live-counter and one person cooks, another serves. If there\u2019s a group of more than 4 people, it gets really difficult to eat. The most convenient solution is for 1-2 people to cook, rest to consume it hot. We also have a culture to eat after the elders. While in most families it comes from a patriarchal mindset where women cook, men eat, that isn\u2019t the case here. I wanted to serve them hot food. My husband did help but it wasn\u2019t consistent. \n\nEdit 4: I still find his behavior rude in every way. He didn\u2019t speak to my mom till late in the evening. I tried to talk to him and still given the silent treatment. I\u2019m aghast at the comments stating I should\u2019ve talked to him about basic courtesies. If he can extend it to his family without the \u201ctalk\u201d, he can do it for mine too.\n\nEdit 5: My husband is a very loving and kind person. We also have a very healthy relationship. Our arguments rarely exceed more than a few minutes. We help each other out whenever we can. I\u2019m sad to see so many folks assume it is toxic because it\u2019s not. We love and care for each other very much. I\u2019d didn\u2019t know what went wrong here and like the comment section, was pretty conflicted! \n\nI\u2019m currently on a sabbatical and he has work from home.", "created_utc": 1693899810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ahp4u/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_care_for_my_family/", "score": 1848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is a line between hospitality and people pleasing and i think you\u2019ve crossed it. But if you haven\u2019t, then it should be because expectations have been communicated and agreed upon.

I say ideal because IRL it's difficult for a modern woman to \" serve\"  her ILs, and have a career, kids and be an empowered woman at the same time. Most DILs end up hating their in laws for their entitlement. In the same culture, the son in law is an entitled AH. His ILs must literally adore and treat him like a precious son.. so is your hb treating your mom in this off hand manner for this reason? It's unacceptable as is his refusal to share work around the house. Btw stop being a maid to your ILs.", "YTA. You need to communicate better. You say you \"went above and beyond\" for your in-laws to the point where you were basically the live-in maid and ignored all your own needs.

If you expect your husband to pick up some of the slack so you can spend time with your parents, TELL HIM THAT. Preferably in advance, so you can adjust your expectations.", "I feel like there isn't enough context here. \n\nBefore I married my husband, together almost 15 years, next month marks 12 married, we discussed EVERYTHING, including expectations when parents, siblings, other family and friends are visiting. This may not seem like a big deal, but it really can be. Before any more family visitors come, you need to sit down and figure it out.", "Did he *ask* you to do any of those things? Because yes they are absolutely unreasonable things to expect. And if you are doing something nice with a covert contract expecting the other person has to do it in return. It's no longer something nice. Either YTA or ESH. YTA if he didn't ask you to do those things. ESH if he did. Nobody should ever be asking for that.\n\nBeing \"overall nice engaging and sweet\" *is* all that should be expected.

ESH because neither of you actually communicated your expectations or needs here. He's also TA because while he can't read your mind - he isn't an infant who needs to be told everything. He didn't even do the bare minimum like asking her if she wanted food or planning an activity that involves all three of you.

Just live and stop trying to live up to something or someone.\n\nYTA. Your taunt. What was the utility of this snarky comment? Did it achieve the result you were after?

But it was you who chose to go that extra mile.\n\nIt doesn't sound as though he is sitting around doing nothing but it's as if the house is running as it normally does with the added exception of a guest being there.  However I don't know if there is a fair split between you of looking after the household or if your mother is a regular visitor.\n\nYou also said that you are currently not working whereas he is.  My guess is you have a lot of free time where he doesn't.\n\nBest thing to do is talk to him about how you hope these kind of visits go in the future.

Classic 'you should've just known!' move. It doesn't matter if *you* decided to go out of your way to be incredibly nice to someone, that doesn't entitle you to expect other people to do the same thing, especially without even asking them to. What are they, psychics?", "YTA, you're pushing your expectations onto him. Sounds like you're acting this way for you, and he doesn't care.

You say it yourself, \"We're all responsible adults\".\n\nAlso, you're not working and he is, so it seems reasonable that you would take more of the housework.\n\nNow, on the \"you didn't wake me up for the gym\" thing, yeah fuck that noise. I mean, as a courtesy, if you notice your partner has slept through their alarm and they have something important to do, then waking them is nice. But it's not your job. For all you know he changed his mind and decided not to get up. He's a big boy now and you're not his mother.\n\nOn the substantive issue here, what's happened is that you have an expectation which he doesn't, and you have failed to communicate this. You clearly have some ingrained idea that when you have visitors over, you act as glorified servants to them the entire time. Cooking, cleaning, waiting hand and foot.\n\nThis is not an absolute. There is no social, ethical or moral requirement to do this. *You* probably feel like it's the correct way to act. But that's you. It's entirely internal to you, something you are choosing to do.\n\nYou do not need to get up and make breakfast for your mother. You do not need to wait until she is finished before you can eat. You do not need to sit up til 2am watching a movie with her unless you want to.\n\nThese are things that you have chosen to do. And you're getting annoyed that your husband hasn't.\n\nHe doesn't have to. This is your choice, not his.\n\nYou don't know eachother that long, so you're probably still finding your feet on compromise. Because that's what is needed here. A middle ground. It is unreasonable of you to require him to meet expectations which you are entirely imposing on yourself. Nobody is forcing you to do this.\n\nAt the same time, this is a partnership. The happiness of each partner should be a priority for the other. So if fussing around guests and running a hotel is what makes you happy, then he should be willing to at least help out in that regard. This doesn't mean he must fuss around after guests (because *you* chose this, not him), but he could pick up some other slack while you're doing it, like getting groceries, doing dishes, etc.\n\nSame as if you were out of the house doing a hobby - would he just leave all the chores for you to do when you get back? I'd hope not.", "YTA\n\nTalk. I may not agree with your husband's stance and think he's being lazy, but you played a whole movie in your head and when reality didn't match your fever dream you became petty and standoffish instead of explaining if/why you were mad.\n\nWhen in a relationship you talk and agree how to handle situations like family visiting. If you two make a plan together and he doesn't stick to it, he's the asshole.\n\nBut you came up with rules in your head (including a specific rule that says \"no talking about the rules\" while family is here cause you don't want to \"argue\" as if you literally can't have a discussion with your partner without being mad at each other) and now you're mad because he hasn't read your mind.\n\nUnless you are not sharing all the details and this relationship is much more toxic than it appears,this is 100% on you.", "YTA (except over the clock gym thing). You sound insecure about looking good in front of company (putting in over-the-top levels effort for your inlaws, and getting mad when he dared to \"air dirty laundry\"). You're obviously fuming about him not being perfect in front of your Mom, but there's a valid counter argument that he's respecting you and her by being authentic and not trying to put on a different face in public than in private. \n\nYour definition of respect and courtesy is not universal so you can't make the assumption. \n\nYou seem quite triggered by the whole situation so thus feels more like you have some issues to unpack.

Yes, I know in a perfect world our spouses would be able to anticipate our every need without it being spoken but sometimes we do need to sit down and have a bit of a discussion when things are bothering us or when something unusual comes along. Something like \u201cHey I\u2019m definitely going to want to spend a lot of extra time with my mom during her visit, so could you pick up the slack on the chores like I did when your parents were here?\u201d would not be an unusual thing to say especially since you are basically still newlyweds. Later on it would be reasonable to expect your spouse to jump in and help without mentioning it. As far as expecting him to cater to your mom and only eat after everybody else has finished I do feel is unreasonable only because I feel it was also unreasonable for you to do that with his folks also. \n\nMy vote is ESH. \n\nYou lightly because it doesn\u2019t seem like you communicated expectations to him and he definitely gets the vote because it didn\u2019t occur to him that you might want to spend time with your mom and he needed to pick up the slack a bit.

Your husband sucks because he could have put a little more effort (not as much as you, but more) into making sure you had the time to spend with your mother as he did when his parents visits.\n\nTo me the Golden Rule and basic observation came to mind. He saw how much you did for him and his parents when they visited, and never seemed to consider maybe you\u2019ll expect the same when it was your parents visiting.

Her intentionally getting up hours earlier than everyone else to make breakfast doesn't allow him to make the breakfast as he normally would when he gets up when he normally does. Sabotaging him by changing the routine, then being mad he didn't intuit what non-standard routine was expected, is setting him up for failure, and a bit manipulative at best. Maybe unintentional, but causing the problem and then playing victim when he doesn't save her from herself is - much as I hate how overused the term is - toxic behaviour. \n\nThe alarm thing, to be honest, if one partner is up and the other doesn't stir at their alarm, it is common courtesy and a reasonable expectation to give them a kick. Exception for things like WFH in a meeting, middle of something that can't be left like a complex cooking task, etc. Not unreasonable to be confused why she didn't if either she was free or he was unaware she wasn't free and appeared to just decide not to poke him to be petty. Again, talking to him so he knows why she didn't and/or knew ahead of time why she wouldn't be able to would be problem solved. \n\nI wouldn't be shocked if, when he noticed how she was taking over everything and whirlwinding around, with him not being given any input or involvement in the change in routine, he just stepped out of the way knowing he'll be in the doghouse for getting in her way or doing it 'wrong'. I get like that (crazy brain), and BF knows best thing is to step back and let me excise that nervous obsessive energy, then recognise when I'll be open to a gentle \"take a break hon\" or \"let me finish that, you go have a rest\". I won't accept help before that point, I'll get upset if he tries to force me to stop before I'm ready, but I can push myself past the point of exhaustion if not guided away. That's a lot to put on him, but we've talked and he's confident in when to step in and how, and knows how to approach me if he needs to try and nix it outwith that process to minimise my stress and his. But the key there is we have (and continue to) talked about it, not me just rampaging off and then being mad that he didn't jump in on it once I've pushed myself too far while he sits confused. Whether this over-hosting on her side is a similar thing to my crazy-brain, or a learned training from over-expectant parenting, or something else entirely, his reaction will be the same: confusion at the change to the norm, lack of knowledge of how to fit in when she's spinning so many plates without knocking half them over, so awaiting a chance to either jump in where a gap forms or when asked, and then bemusement at being griped at for not guessing better.", "I think a lot of people are missing the cultural aspect. I kind of thought when reading it that I just have inherent differences from OP traditionwise. But I still think she\u2019s doing too much.

I think it's important to understand that your husband is not a mind reader and that every one shows their affection in different ways. If there is something specific you wanted - you need to talk to him and tell him that, not lash out at him because he is not doing something you've decided in your head is what needs to be done. It seems like he otherwise reasonably gets along with your mom and is engaged with her - isn't that the most important part? Besides, is there other ways in which your husband does things that you don't do (for example, my husband isn't the greatest with household chores but he bought my parents business class tickets to visit because he wanted them to enjoy their travel to us and drives them around everywhere) -  it's just a different way of showing affection. NAH, just communicate better and realize not everyone has the same beliefs about guests as you have been raised to have, and that's ok!", "I'm disgusted with these critical responses from Westerners. When you marry someone from another culture, you are merging two cultures. These critics have cultural myopia and do not understand the importance and meaning the wife's practices or values, instead suggesting that she's backward and oppressed.  Why do Westerners tend to assume that in an intercultural marriage the non-Westerner should abandon their culture? Why would the wife not want to pass on her highest values and practices? \n\nServing people is a privilege, not an obligation. It's an expression of love, community, even divine presence. Formal hospitality, sharing food, warm conversation are hallmarks of a strong family bond. The West, particularly the USA, has a pathologically individualist culture with weak family bonds. In many cultures, the family is the primary unit of social organization that constituted one's main economic, spiritual, and social spheres. Family as one's rock, champion, and comfort. \n\nThe husband put in minimal effort. He missed an opportunity to integrate himself into his wife's family and them into his. He showed superficial politeness, but not respect. He gave minimal opportunity to the parents to get to know him, share family lore, or communicate family values and practices. \n\nTo those who criticized the wife on feminist grounds--how dare you? It's incredibly offensive to presume your cultural preferences are universal. The OP made it VERY clear that this was something she needed. How dare you call her \"subservient\" for wanting to express her love for her own fucking family on her own fucking terms and expect to be able to depend on her husband's full support. These responses are the worst of \"white feminism\". Shame.  \n\nA way forward would be for the couple to have extensive discussion about their assumptions and expectations, as any couple should, but so few do. When I lived in abroad, I told all my friends that if they are upset with me to tell me promptly and directly, because we are from different cultures with wildly different worldviews, and we can not assume intent was communicated or understood. OP clearly understands that an intercultural marriage requires synthesis. Her husband appears to assume his wife and children will simply swap their rich culture for his own. Um, why would he even think that? \n\nThis is an opportunity for him to learn about one of the grandest and most ancient cultures in the world--homeland of some of the oldest scripture, birthplace of a shocking number of world religions and philosophical systems, and let's not even get started on the food. He would be a fool to trade all that for scrolling Instagram while sulking in the bathroom. NTA", "NAH\n\nThis is a communication issue. You have different standards for visiting family. You can either lower what you do to match his effort, try to raise what he does to match your effort, or accept the discrepancy. Whatever you choose, talk to him first!", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say NAH, maybe NTA. I\u2019m Indian, though born and raised in the US and my family is pretty modern, and I know the types of expectations that are placed on DILs in this type of family structure. They\u2019re pretty extreme, and even if you don\u2019t necessarily believe in them/want to deal with them, if your husband\u2019s family is traditional then you may not have much of a choice if you don\u2019t want to rock the boat or want your in-laws to like you. I think a lot of the comments here are lacking that cultural context. It\u2019s really, really hard to set boundaries in this type of situation. \n\nYour husband, on the other hand, has never had to deal with those expectations, and unfortunately has probably not truly realized just how demanding it is for a DIL in this position. He probably also isn\u2019t realizing just how much you\u2019re doing, primarily because you\u2019re implicitly expected to. If he is generally empathetic, him not returning the favor when your mom is over is probably a lack of awareness, and though it might be a little frustrating, you might need to sit him down and explain just how tiring it is to do everything and that him not reciprocating makes you feel like he doesn\u2019t care. That mostly leads me to NAH. \n\nHowever, some of the behavior you describe (snapping at you, ignoring you by locking himself in his room) is rude in any circumstance - not doing things like this is the bare minimum when having guests.

Leave the hubby at home.", "You're an Indian. And that explains everything. So am I and I get your frustrations. As much as I would like to believe that your husband should have understood the assignment without you communicating it to him, I would like to point out, women/girls are taught all this nonsense but the men/boys aren't. They have seen their mothers do it and not the fathers and hence that cycle continues. It is the story of every household. Even your own mother is worried that her son-in-law is upset because that's what she's taught as well, \"my daughter's husband is upset with my daughter. What do we need to do fix it/appease him?\". The reason or the fault doesn't even matter here. Highly patriarchal society. If you think your husband is understanding, then you can tell all of your frustrations to your husband, maybe after your mother leaves, but it will be slow progress. Mostly, married Indian men don't give two hoots about their in-laws visiting and don't even TRY to understand how much their wives go above and beyond for his own parents. If an Indian man deviates from this patriarchal norm then he's actually an exception to the rule. I'm sorry you're going through this nonsense. I really do wish you all the best when either set of the in-laws visit next time.\n\nEdit: I vote NTA since I have the cultural context here", "NAH.

I think that Indian culture is beautiful and he is missing out on a lot.
