She does sound difficult But being able to co-parent peacefully with your ex will only help your son in the long run. Instead of saying I can do what I want on my time maybe try the benefits of it. I\u2019m not saying let your kid go crazy but studies do show when something is totally forbidden teenagers want to do it even more and they will do it behind your back which could be dangerous. Letting him have a glass of wine (which is common in other cultures/countries) also teaches him responsible drinking. It makes him feel like if he wants to try something he can talk to you about it. Instead of doing it behind your back. I\u2019m Italian so we could always have a glass of wine at dinner too. Even in HS my parents told me & my friends we could drink with them.

Probably not a lot of Brits scanning Reddit so early \ud83e\udd23", "probably not A+ but culture and country comes into play big time. and i am not sure much about family court", "I'm not a non custodial parent, and he wasn't drinking with my girlfriend. We were all having dinner together, and we allowed each child one glass of wine.", "Because it is not a cultural thing for the child, something that is understood or discussed between the parents.", "Well, I've been there quite a bit lately so I can tell you that 100%, it doesn't matter if something is legal. I just got a court order saying my ex husband can't leave my kids alone with his current wife because I was able to successfully argue she was lacking in good judgement. It's really wild what you can do with determination and a good lawyer.", "that\u2019s interesting. but once again would depend on where OP lives", "Yes, this is true. But based on mom's reaction, I'm assuming it's not the norm for their area.", "maybe. i mean in australia it\u2019s normal to drink young, however there are some people who hate it and won\u2019t let their kid drink despite the fact it\u2019s normal", "What bothers me is the only reason he allowed it is because his gf was doing it. So it's not something he feels strongly about, it was basically peer pressure. I'm absolutely sure he didn't know it was legal before she told him.", "i can see how that bothers you"]}
