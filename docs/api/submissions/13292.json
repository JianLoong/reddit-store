I\u2019m not saying let your kid go crazy but studies do show when something is totally forbidden teenagers want to do it even more and they will do it behind your back which could be dangerous. Letting him have a glass of wine (which is common in other cultures/countries) also teaches him responsible drinking. It makes him feel like if he wants to try something he can talk to you about it. Instead of doing it behind your back. I\u2019m Italian so we could always have a glass of wine at dinner too. Even in HS my parents told me & my friends we could drink with them.

If someone dates or not, is that much personal, that no outside party has to have a say in it.  \nThere is no downside to starting to date this young (and before someone thinks about it: There is absolutly no downside to starting to have safe sex this young).  \nLearn to explore your body, and yourself, and explore it with others together.  \nGet to know different kinds of sex.", "of course they should have no say, if the 13yo is allowed to date.  \nAnd nope, if the 13yo wants to date the 24yo neighbor, they have definitly no input. If the 13yo asks them about their opinion on it, they can give their input.  \nIf the 24yo is also interested in dating the 13yo, it is from my pov better to call law enforcement, and not to interfere directly.   \nIf 13yo and 15yo are dating, there is definitly no problem", "I was in the UK at the time. 1990s.

Liquor laws vary by state, and in some places, parents have an absolute right to give their kids a much booze as they want. \n\nSource: was a bartender in Texas.", "It depends on the state. There are a few states that allow minors/under 21 (with varying minimum ages, I think) to have a drink with a parent's permission at restaurants and at home. (I looked this up when I was *19* to see if my parents would let me get a drink at a fancy dinner we were going to, lol).", "Especially since the article is pretty much garbage. The author states in the first paragraph that they are for the higher drinking age, meaning the article is not neutral, which then is painfully obvious as they go into great detail when the higher drinking age is beneficial, but then only saying lower is bad (meaning the numbers are likely not significant), citing studies that in now way are comparable. Plus all effects are attributed solely to the drinking age, totally ignoring other things that have been done. So this article (that is in no way scientific) is not even making any sense in this discussion.", "Yeah, if wine gives you more headaches than when you drink more of another kind of alcohol, it's probably sulfite sensitivity. My mom doesn't drink at all anymore, but she'd get a terrible headache off one glass of wine-- and not even as a hangover, just a short while afterward.", "So you think alcohol is comparable to medicinal products, some of which cannot even be gotten without a doctor? Sure, caffeine is not medicinal but it is at the very least an accepted drug that the kid could buy on their own from the store, which they can't do for alcohol.", "Well, that doesn't sound like you two have great communication. For the sake of your kid, I would consider trying to improve that.", "Curfew is relevant because usually the age at which kids start dating is usually around when they start driving - so they may not have needed an established curfew before, but now they\u2019re going out more and it\u2019s a discussion.\n\nI would argue it\u2019s pretty standard for minors to NOT be allowed to have romantic partners over when no parents are home. \n\nBirth control is more serious and sensitive. Here\u2019s a situation: 16 y/o daughter is dating a boy. You\u2019ve made it clear she can be honest and open if she chooses to tell you about sex and that as long as she\u2019s safe you\u2019re happy. She swears they aren\u2019t having sex and therefore she doesn\u2019t need birth control. Do you take that at face value? Do you make an appointment with her PCP and request that the PCP discuss options with her?", "How old are you?", "These are truly bizarre answers from you. How old are you?? I have to assume you are a young teenager from these responses. I know it\u2019s hard to imagine but *most* adults learn a few things as they grow up. It is in fact the role of a parent to guide and protect our children.", "You understand that parents are responsible for their children\u2019s welfare up until they are 18, right. So if the 15 and 45 are dating, the parents should just be all, cool, we\u2019ll wait for the cops to do something about it?", "Relationships not being a parent's business would just get many children hurt. Parents absolutely need to make sure the person they are dating is good and safe. That's not to say they should be super strict or anything; not allowing your child to date another person because of a hair out of place is stupid and should not happen. But parents should be involved in their childrens dating lives. A parent ABSOLUTELY should be involved if their child is dating someone thrice their age. That's so dangerous.", "In the UK you can drink at home with parent/guardian permission from 5, then beer/cider in a restaurant with a meal and guardian's permission from 16, and anything from 18.", "I was 11 in the 90\u2019s in the UK, I used to go down to the pub with my grandad on a Sunday afternoon, we\u2019d watch the cricket, he\u2019d do his crossword and buy me a shandy (for the non-Brits that\u2019s a half pint of lager, half sprite/7-up type soda). Those were good days.", "It also weirdly applies to spouses in some states.  (A 21yo can buy drinks for their 20yo spouse) \n\nI can legally give my kid alcohol in my house (but if she did something dumb, i could still be arrested for contributing to the delinquency of a minor), laws are weird", "This kid can legally drink in a private residence. It\u2019s the same as any other drug if it\u2019s legal.", "I don't think you have to experience a culture since birth to be a part of it-- for example, children who are adopted into a different culture and later participate in the culture of their birth, or someone who moves to a region and lives there for years can become part of a regional culture, especially if they move there as a child (I'm not talking about closed cultures or ethnicity here, I mean like, if you move to, like, the South from another part of the US, or if you move to France as a child and grow up there, or if, as one of my teachers did, you move to the US as a child--she's definitely part of American culture as well as the culture of the place she lived for the first 9 years of her life (Germany)). And outsiders can be invited to participate in certain aspects of a culture by those who are part of it, like if a Chinese friend invites you to make mooncakes with her for the Mid-Autumn Festival, or I invite someone traveling from abroad to the weird bastardized Chicago Irish-American St Patrick's Day dinner my dad's family does. \n\nBut I agree with you that OP is in the wrong here. Letting teens drink is not part of his and his ex's local or family culture and it's not something they agreed on. At 15\\*, it's a two-yeses one-no thing, and this isn't a sip of Communion wine or one sip for a toast, which I think would be less of a big deal. (I also think it's fine to let a teenager have a small glass of wine very occasionally-- but both parents/guardians have to agree). Particularly in this case because it sounds like it will be an ongoing issue if the 14 y/o is sometimes allowed to drink, and both OP and his ex need to decide how to handle that with their son.\n\n\\*once they're 18-20 and an adult, I think if one parent wants to let them have a drink at dinner that's no longer a decision that requires permission.", "What? THere I live, that is definitly not the case. Here you start going out on your own and meeting up with your friends, at the age of 6 or 7. No need for a car or such things, public transportation and bikes are the way to go.  \n\n\nThere I come from it's normal to ahve them over, because if you try to stop them from doing waht they want to do, they will just do it elsewhere (and probably somewhere unsafe). Either you just accept that they grow up and experiment, and offer a safe environment, or you push them to do it in unsafe areas, with much higher risks.  \n\n\nI would go the middle road. Tell her, there the condoms lay in house, and that she can always grab some of them, if something should happen.", "29", "Question: What happens if you forbid your 15yo from dating the 45yo?  \nMost likely it will happen in secret from that point on, and they learn to tell you nothing again.  \nIf you call law enforcement on the 45yo without interfering directly, the chances are higher that the 15yo will come to you again with problems.  \n\n\nI'm 29. And there is a difference between \"guiding and protecting\" and not letting them doing anything on their own.", "I don't know where you are from, but afaik, that is one of the things there the cops will be nearly instant there.", "Irelands the same", "Yeah, that is not legal", "I LOVED shandy \ud83d\ude03", "This is what I would love to know! The absolute horror shock and downright hysteria over drinking a glass of wine with a meal, can't have even university students drinking. \n\nBut they can buy guns from the supermarket. Kids are taught how to shoot live animals, and that's fine. That's culture. That's how people live.", "Why are you assuming the commenter above you is not also pro gun control? Also these two issues are not related at all. Europe can be right on guns and wrong on other things.", "Legal or not in a private residence, your comment was a really terrible take on the subject because those substances aren't at all comparable to each other. Alcohol is not a necessity like paracetamol in lowering fever or anaesthesia during a medical procedure. Caffeine is also not at all regulated, unlike alcohol which means that they're on different levels, even in the eyes of the law. So no, they're not the same at all.\n\nBesides, the problem here isn't the law but rather OP's childish behaviour of essentially \"I can do anything I want with the kid as long as they're on my watch\" although I don't remember the exact quote. They're being disrespectful to the other parent by not having the decency of even asking them when alcohol is clearly by society seen as something controversial.", "Yeah, there are 2 parents facing jail time for buying their child a gun that he then used at his school. \nIn Maryland, they passed stricter drinking laws for minors after an ex-Ravens cheerleader bought her children alcohol for a party at their Ocean City home. Kids left the party, driving drunk, and died or killed others (don't recall) and now there are more strict laws governing giving minors alcohol."]}
