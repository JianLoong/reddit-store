Ignoring this species is usually the best course of action to take.", "NTA, she was acting ridiculous. Nobody should be expected to be constantly looking over the people behind them and let whoever has less items in front of them, the line is there for a reason, first come first serve.\n\nyeah like the other commenter said she was probably in a bad mood and decided to take it out on a stranger. No need to think much of it.", "NTA.  You should have told her she had no reason to be rude just because you are young.

She should of left you alone.\n\nAlso she didn\u2019t ask beforehand to go first. This really isn\u2019t your fault", "Nta.  She's entitled and impatient.  There is no time that people with one thing get to go first.", "NTA. It is a line/que. If you let everyone with less items go ahead of you then you would never check out. This is just a grumpy old lady being entitled due to her age. \n\nWhile when I'm feeling very generous or maybe have a FULL cart/trolly I will let the person with one or two items go first, generally I just go. The sooner I get my items scanned the sooner I'm out the door. Also 9 times out of 10 there is a completely empty lane right next to us so if they are in that big of a hurry they can scoot.", "NTA and that's really rude to act that way to someone. They were probably dealing with some other bullshit in their life and taking it out on you.", "NTA\n\nGrown ass adults often think that they are entitled to deference from minors, which is not the same as manners. Where the hell were her manners, screaming at a child for literally just getting stuff from the store the same as everyone else?", "NTA. She\u2019s got some issues", "NTA \n\nNo one is entitled to skip in line. Sure, it\u2019s a nice thing to do and I usually do let people skip if they have one or two items.

She lost all claim to \u201cmanners\u201d when she started complaining and being rude to you.", "NTA. She was quite rude about it. There are general unwritten ettiquette rules that say someone behind you with fewer items should be ahead but they're def not mandatory.", "NTA\n\nLike, you only had 6 or 7 things as you said. And the trouble with the machine could have happened to anyone. Hey, you could have let her go ahead and she could have had trouble paying, holding you up.\n\nIf I have a trolley full and somebody behind me only has what they can carry by hand I'll often let them go ahead.

Regardless of you having issues or not at checkout, her running it into the ground was needless.", "NTA. Her behavior speaks for itself.", "NTA. She sounds entitled and doesn\u2019t have any fucking patience.

And to group everyone within a generation into one boat is just dumb.", "NTA\n\nImho if she *asked* to get ahead of you while you were both still in the line it's common courtesy to let someone with a single item get ahead.

I\u2019m from the Midwest (US) and most everyone is all about manners, respecting others, if you see someone with less items than you, let them go ahead. But this method has always produced people who think they\u2019re entitled to go just because they have less items, usually older generations. Tapping their feet, sighing a lot, arms crossed, those are usually heavy indicators that the person behind you is super entitled. When I have someone like that behind me, no matter how many or few items they have, I never let them go a head. A small dose or reality if you will. Sometimes, you have to knock them off their pedestal, even if it is only a slight inconvenience for them to wait a minute or two extra to check out.", "I wouldn't even go that far in this case. OP only had 6 or 7 items. If I've got a trolley full then I'm happy to let somebody with a small number of items go ahead, I'd even offer without being asked.

Again, NTA", "Well, yes and no.\n\nI believe it depends on how the older person behaves.
