Nope. \n\nAlso, just because you were very independent as a child doesn\u2019t your son is ready for the same (and in a very different environment).

You\u2019re an adult, stop being lazy and walk your son to the store.", "I'm gonna have to lean more towards YTA here.\n\nAs the others have pointed out, you're raising your son in a city, in 2023, there are real risks to just letting your son run off at that age without supervision. I understand what you mean about being raised in a rural area, my father grew up in a rural area also, and most likely similar to you, grew up in a situation where everyone knew everyone in town. Still though, my dad would never have let me run off on my own at that age. A city is much bigger, and you don't always know who your neighbors are or who is hanging around the block.\n\nEven assuming where you live is totally safe, and there's absolutely no risk to your kid going 2 blocks to get some candy at the store, telling your son to keep it a secret is pretty much lying already in a particular way.", "YTA I also grew up rural but there\u2019s a big difference between letting your kid do something unsupervised vs endangering your child. \n\nYes, your 7 year old probably is capable of walking to a store and coming straight home. However, in a more populated area there is a much higher risk of a stranger grabbing your kid and you never seeing them again. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201ctrustworthy\u201d your kid is, your actually placing your trust in complete strangers not to hurt him.", "Seriously?", "YTA You basically told your son to lie or \u201cOmit the Truth\u201d and you put him in danger. There is no way in Hell that I would let any of my kids walk at that age or even as teenagers by themselves two blocks anywhere. I don\u2019t care how responsible they are or what. These days kids get snatched off the streets in seconds and you wouldn\u2019t know any different. My question is..What are YOU doing that is so important that you can\u2019t take time out of your day and walk with your son to go get \u201ccandy at the 7/11\u201d?! If I were his mom..I wouldn\u2019t trust anything that came out of your mouth from this point on and that\u2019s your own fault.", "YTA Letting your kid out to travel short distances is not a problem. I have a free range kid. My son was out and about at 7, too. I\u2019m also in a city.\n\nThe problem is that you and your ex need to be on the same page. You should have consulted her before letting your kid take the step of venturing out on their own.\n\nNever burden your child with secrets.", "YTA you put your son in DANGER and told him to lie to his mom. Wth is wrong with you", "YTA.  Besides telling a 7-year-old to lie by omission to his mother, two blocks in a city is too far to go and there are too many dangers.  Depending on where you live, this is very likely to be considered child endangerment and if so, you won't have to worry about disagreements with your ex over shared custody because she'll have full custody.", "YTA\n\nKids in the city have to grow up fast, too. We learned fast not to look at someone too long, not to talk to strangers, watch out for needles in the streets, etc. You are severely underestimating the danger, and that's not even touching on teaching your kid that Mom is the enemy.", "YTA a 7yr old needs supervision in a store! Living in the city is very different than rural.", "YTA twofold. Your son could get snatched. Daniel Morcombe was a teen when he was stolen and murdered. Plus you\u2019re teaching your son to lie to his mum. You should do a parenting course to find out how to care for a child appropriately. I\u2019d organise it before she organises to reduce your custody.", "YTA. First, you\u2019re asking your son to hide something from his mother\u2014not technically lying, but you\u2019re still telling him to keep secrets from his parent. Secondly, if you are coparenting a kid, it\u2019s an asshole move to do things that your coparent has specifically asked you not to do (let kid out alone). Third, and I *cannot believe* I have to say this, a kid of seven walking alone in a city is absolutely unsafe. What you did in a rural area during your own childhood does not compare to a 7 year old walking alone for two city blocks in 2023. Honestly, it\u2019s only a matter of time before something happens to your kid if you keep allowing this. If I were the other parent, I\u2019d 100% take you to court over this and have custody rearranged.", "YTA, you\u2019re putting your kid in danger of being abducted, and you\u2019re putting them in danger of being taken advantage. No-one should ever teach a child that it is ok to keep secrets from their parents or have \u201cjust between us\u201d secrets. I don\u2019t think you fully understand what a dangerous precedent you are setting", "YTA\n\nYou said it yourself, times have changed, meaning there is still potential for danger to come, for a seven year old boy who I imagine hasnt been taught in what to do in dangerous situations, but thats not the main point. If I were that ex's friend, I would have walked out to him and ask him a few questions, make sure he was safe, and get him to 7/11 and back home, then called up the mother. Im a mother myself, even back in my day, my own mother would never let me walk by myself without my sister especially (being the exception it was across the street to another friends house). Does your son even have a phone to call for help?? And also, as a mother, I feel agreeable with your ex, you lied to her, and involved your son into keeping it between you, so this is entirely your fault.", "0\\_0\n\nYTA Big time. I live in one of the so-called safest places in EU, and while kids are allowed to mess around where they live at that age, I've never seen a seven-year-old just out in a random park by themselves or allowed to go two blocks to a freaking gas station for candy. This is a stupid decision and you should be reported. Gas stations are extremely busy with cars and people not paying attention, he could be hit or just taken and no one would ever freaking know.", "YTA.  It\u2019s a very different thing for kids to roam in a rural area vs an urban one.  At 7, most kids are still not great at things like street safety that are necessary to going around unsupervised in a city.  I\u2019m turning 40, and grew up in a suburban area - we were allowed to be out on our street (which was deliberately designed short and curvy so only people going to houses on the street would use it) when other kids were around, but we weren\u2019t allowed to go out onto the street that only served our neighborhood at 7, much less out onto any of the more heavily trafficked streets.  The only exception we had was walking to school in the morning, and that was because we walked with the kids a few houses down and there was a crossing guard for the only crossing that wasn\u2019t a short, curved street only used by the folks who lived on it.\n\nCorner stores are also a pretty common location for things you don\u2019t want a 7 year old walking into, even in otherwise safe neighborhoods, like adults drinking in public and drug deals and whatnot.\n\nTelling your son to lie by omission and teaching him that it\u2019s okay to do things his mother says no to if he hides it from her is its own problem, and not a small one.  It\u2019s definitely not the way to raise an honest and trustworthy son.  Remember that most humans generalize lessons, so if it\u2019s okay to hide this thing his parent disapproves of, it\u2019s also okay to hide other things one (or both) of his parents disapproves of.  That\u2019s a slippery slope that gets ugly fast.", "YTA\n\nNot for wanting your kid to have some freedom and responsibility, although I question your way of going about it (very irresponsible!), but for telling your kid to lie to his mother.\n\nAlso: a city now is nowhere near comparable to your rural upbringings then.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s entirely too many sickos out here for you to think letting a 7 year old child walk two blocks to a 7/11 a convenience store where all types of weirdos hang out.

This is no different except the potential predators are in the street and approach kids in a friendly trustworthy manner. Your son isn't capable of dealing with that yet.", "Until he is abducted and you have to explain to the mother on why he was alone? Talk about an idiot. YTA.

What HAS changed is the 24 hour news cycle has you convinced that everything is terrifying and more dangerous when it used to be, when in fact the opposite is true. \n\nChild abductions have dropped 40% in the last two decades, even though our population has increased by a third\u2014that makes the drop actually less than 40%. \n\nBetween 1993 and 2013, the number of kids injured or killed by being struck by a vehicle fell by about 2/3.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2004, violent assaults against children fell by 2/3.

When I was 5 I walked alone to the bus stop by the side of the road, by 9 I was already driving in the property\u2026 I now have a 7 year old son with my ex girlfriend (26F) and we have shared custody. \n\nGranted, we now live in the city, and I know times are different, but I don\u2019t see anything wrong with letting him walk two blocks to get some candy at 7/11 or something. His mother doesn\u2019t agree with this, but in my mind I\u2019m free to do my parenting choices, just as she is. I just asked my son not to mention anything so as not so start trouble (important to say, I didn\u2019t ask him to lie to his mother, just to keep his short walks between us). \n\nWell, one of my ex\u2019s friends who also lives in the neighborhood saw my son walking alone by the park. My ex called me to say I was putting our kid in danger and called me an AH for making him keep this from her (because of course I told her it wasn\u2019t the first time, as a way to show he\u2019s responsible and has proved to be trustworthy with the small freedoms I give him).

While overall children are actually safer these days, a city is very different than a small town or rural area, and 7 is just a bit too young to safely navigate a city. For one thing, kids that age are generally too small to be seen over the hood of an SUV or truck, so crossing streets alone isn't really safe. Also, you've put your child in a position where they have to lie, which is messed up. You need to wait until he's closer to 10 and then have this conversation with his mother.", "YTA. This is a big enough decision that both parents need to agree on what the rule is. But rather than that you\u2019re asking your son to lie to his mother no matter how you phrase it. \n\nEven though you\u2019re no longer together, as co-parents there has to be trust between the two of you when it comes to raising your child.", "YTA for making your kid lie and for disrespecting your ex\u2019s erring to the side of caution.

And were they giant SUVs with drivers distracted by cell phones? How many people would you encounter? Were those people known to your family \u201cthe neighbors cousin\u201d or were they complete strangers? What were the laws then and now regarding leaving children alone? Is it likely that if a police officer saw your son alone walking down the road he would think he was endangered and stop him?

BUT you lived in a rural area, and the city is not safe for a 7 year old to be alone.", "YTA. And you know it, because you are asking your child to lie by omission. You're lucky that it was a friend that saw your son and not a predator. Have you bothered to look at the number if sex offenders living in those 2 blocks? \n\nYou're being ridiculously irresponsible with your son and this isn't 30 years ago in some rural area.

You've obviously never known someone who lost a child, or you wouldn't be so casual risking your own.", "Yes you are an AH", "YTA. You absolutely told him to lie.

How do you think he'll fare with an adult picking him up and taking him to their van? Or even luring him to a house with the promise of puppies, a new bike, help me out, and I'll pay you, etc. Is it really worth the risk. If you think so, then you should give your ex full custody because that's a scary and dangerous way of thinking. I hope you see sense before something really bad happens", "YTA! Not only did you go against his mothers wishes, you put him in danger, and you asked him to lie about it. If it was my child, I\u2019d be fighting for you not to see him unless supervised.

He was in the crosswalk, he had the walk sign, still got hit by a distracted driver. In a world where people are driving giant SUVs and pickup trucks that are high up off the ground, a small child is **easily** out of view. \n\nYTA, both for teaching your son it\u2019s ok to hide things from his mother, and for putting him at risk. City living is *far different* than rural living.", "YTA. I don't know your city or the levels of crime there, but you are the ah for telling your kid to keep secrets from his mum.

I also grew up in a city where kids did this( of course many years ago) . However, in both places I think there was an idea that in the neighborhood people know each other and keep an eye out (not sure how it is for you) might be worthy to go to some of the neighborhood shops and introduce yourself and your kid.. and just say hey I\u2019m teaching my kid how to be responsible so sometimes he\u2019ll be walking alone? Of course they don\u2019t have a responsibility. But worth a try :) .. also it\u2019s a great way to know your community!", "Telling your son to keep information from his mother is teaching him to be deceptive.  Like lying by omission.   Not good parenting.\n\nI have seen articles on where parents have been turned into CPS for allowing  children to do just what you let your son do.  Just walking to the store, the bus stop, a friend\u2019s house.  You can argue that this is being overprotective, that back in your childhood you rode your bike for miles through the city streets.\n\nIn the city, it is different.  Many more people, many  more opportunities for trouble.  Really nice neighborhoods can sit right next to problem areas.  Groups of kids can pick on kids alone.  \n\nHe isn\u2019t old enough, or big enough, to have to prove himself trustworthy or responsible.  I think you need to reconsider your position.", "YTA, child trafficking is a thing, people only find out is quite prevalent once they are victims. How do you expect a 7 year old to fight of an adult, nevermind a group of adults. \n\nSomething may never happen, but if it does, you have allowed your child put themselves into a vulnerable situation and given them 0 tools or ways to get themselves out of it. Not fair on the child.", "Wow. Not concerned about his safety?", "YTA. Your are free to do your own parenting choices....as long as your choices arent endangering the kid, which yours are.\n\nThe world is dangerous, always has been, especially in the city.

Kidnapping aside, letting a kid that young walk alone for a few blocks, where I'm assuming there could be traffic and other things around like the mentioned park, goes well untill it doesnt. He could be as bright as a bulb, the smartest 7yo around, but they just dont have the ability to rationally assess the actual danger and consequenses of a lot of situations, especially if they seem shiny and fun.\n\nAs for kidnapping, I have no idea how likely that is in your area. If someone were to do it, I would think it would be easier to target a kid they've seen walking alone and unsupervised on the regulare.\n\nYou are also telling your kid to hide things from his mom because you dont want to deal with the conflict your choises is a part of creating. You are putting your kid in the middle of a parental conflict, making him responsible for not telling mommy so she will be mad at daddy. Cut that out and figure this out with your ex, contact a mediator or talk to the courts if you cant come to an agreement between you, so you can get more unbiased third party perspectives.", "Sorry but YTA. Cities are dangerous places. with respect, I think you have called this wrong. and asking him to keep this from his mum? not cool.", "YTA. 1) Times are different. What was safe 20 years ago may not be safe now. 2) Urban areas are very different from rural areas. Levels of safety are very different. Two blocks is a long way in an urban area for a 7 yr old to be walking and anything can happen. 3) Allowing your 7 yr old to walk more than a few doors down alone is something that should have absolutely been run by his mother. Just because you two aren\u2019t in a relationship anymore, doesn\u2019t mean either of you can parent as you see fit without ever consulting the other. 4) You did ask your son to lie to his mother. You put him in a terrible position because you obviously knew his mother wouldn\u2019t be okay with what you\u2019re doing. 5) Her fears have nothing to do with whether or your son is trustworthy. They\u2019re about all of the other dangers lurking out there, and there are many. I mean, have you ever turned on the news or opened a newspaper? Or even just noticed the articles that pop up when you open google? I hope you\u2019ve spoken to your son about what can happen while he\u2019s out alone, but frankly you don\u2019t strike me as the type who would. You strike me as the type who just thought \u201cI\u2019m feeling lazy and don\u2019t want to walk with him and it was safe when I was his age so\u2026.\u201d and then just sent him on his way without considering the very real consequences.

The vast majority of the time it\u2019s a family member or friend. So mom is more likely to snatch him than anyone else, just to \u201cprove her point\u201d\n\nThat being said, don\u2019t ask the kid to keep secrets from m. That\u2019s not fair on him.

In a city?\n\nI'll bet that when you were allowed to walk alone as a child, being in a rural area, you probably knew most of the other people around and probably any other adults around kept an eye on you too. In cities, everyone keeps to themselves and will NOT watch out for your little one out on his own.\n\nAs a child raised from separated parents, I am going to ask you to please find a way to not be too stubborn on your parenting choices and find a good way to co-parent with your ex. Yes that will sometimes mean compromising, sometimes even giving in to her way of thinking but if you can co-parent well - your child will have the best opportunity to the be the best version of themselves.\n\nIf you can find a way to be consistent with your parenting with your ex, both agreeing to rules and expectations, everyone's live will be so much easier - particularly when they hit teenage years.

I've watched way too many kids who are under 10 literally cross the street without ever checking to see if there are cars coming. Even without the \"stranger danger\" possibility, cities are dangerous just for the amount of traffic a kid would need to navigate. When I was 18, a 7-year-old was killed across from my old Elementary school because he tried to cross the road alone and stepped right in front of a car that hit and killed him. I was away at college at the time and practically had a heart attack because the local TV news mispronounced his last name as my last name so I thought it had been one of my cousins. Scariest freaking minute of my life calling home to find out it wasn't any of my cousins.\n\nSo while I support letting kids have some freedom and age-appropriate independence and not being too overprotective like my Mom was, I don't think any parent could live with themselves if their kid was hit abd killed by a car while walking a few blocks alone or, God forbid, got abducted or something.\n\nAnd, of course, doing it behind the Mom's back knowing she wouldn't approve and essentially telling the kid to hide it from his Mom is a major asshole move. My Mom was super overprotective and my Dad was way more chill because he grew up on a farm, but they discussed things like me going out alone and my Dad teaching ne to drive at 14 because they were jointly my parents and had equal say in my upbringing. OP claims to be co-parenting their son but he doesn't seem to understand the actual meaning of that word because he's clearly acting like a single parent, there's no cooperation between him and his ex which just makes it bad all around for the kid. OP needs to act like an adult, realize his mistakes, and kearn from them while working on his communication skills with his ex so they can be consistent in parenting their 7-year-old who already has to move between two different homes, meaning stability between the two homes abd oarents is even more important.\n\nAlso, OP's actions could make his ex decide to try to change their custody agreement because gets proven she can't trust him with their son, and telling the kid to lie by omission to his Mom is probably not going to look good in the judge's eyes and he could easily view it as you unnecessarily endangering your son just to spite his Mom's rules against letting him walk through the city alone \n\nAlso, OP, you may think your son proved on previous excursions alone to be responsible enough in your eyes, but you're overlooking that it's others around him who might not be responsible or trustworthy. I was never allowed to walk to/from the bus stop alone as a kid despite living in a rural area because shortly before I was born, an 8-year-old girl got off the school bus on a rural side road and never made it the 50 feet to her driveway. She still has never been found 38 years later and the police have 0 leads other than a distinctive van seen near the bus stop around that time. I wasn't aware of the case as a kid and always thought it was stupid and insulting that my Mom refused to let 10-year-old me walk home from the bus stop across the street alone, but I understand her fear now because the unthinkable did happen in the relative safety of a rural small town and if it happened once, it could happen again. And my Mom wasn't about to risk losing her daughter when she was able to meet me at the bus stop every day.", "Yeah.

The only thing that has gone up in that time is their likelihood of being killed at school (in the US), which is not what we\u2019re talking about here.", ">  They could get lost, sick, in an accident, who knows - or even just scared\n\nIn a two block trip within their own neighborhood?", "It\u2019s not just social media, when I had my kid 15 years ago, I was already in the same mindset that things were way more dangerous at the time than they were when I was a kid, and social media was barely getting started. \n\nIt is absolutely a contributing factor nowadays, but the traditional media started this trend long before social media got involved.", "It\u2019s not that they are more dangerous, it\u2019s that the dangers have changed.  \n\nAs many have pointed out, many of the traditional \u201cdangers\u201d aren\u2019t as prevalent today, despite people insisting they are.  \n\nMedia has made huge changes in the last 50 years which has brought awareness of many things that previously weren\u2019t on our radar.", "There are risks from being cooped up as well. Everywhere in the world, seven year olds walk to school unsupervised and do small errands on their own. There are real harms that come from denying your child age appropriate freedoms and responsibilities.", "you're more of a threat than a kidnapping,", "For context, roughly 200,000 children are kidnapped every year by a parent or other family member", "You said if the kid is comfortable then it's fine, and I'm saying his comfort with it shouldn't be the sole determining factor. Anyway if you agree that the dad shouldn't be telling the kid to lie to his mom I'm not sure why you're giving it the judgement you are. How exactly is the mom at fault?", "A 7 year old is still safer with an adult than alone, and if the mom doesn't want him to go out alone in the city at that age, he shouldn't be doing it.", "not allowing a 7 year old to walk around a city by themselves is not \u201cwrapping them in cotton wool\u201d, it\u2019s common sense. i think it\u2019s fine after a certain age but not single digits, and certainly not in a city. again, just because it doesn\u2019t always happen doesn\u2019t mean it never happens. it\u2019s a huge risk. but to me, it\u2019s the secret keeping that\u2019s the biggest problem.", "Agreed", "Mid 90s in LA", "Also driveways where cars are backing out or pulling in without looking.", ">Google missing children cases. Hell, look up how many kids are missing this year.\n\nMissing does not mean \"abducted by a stranger\".\n\n> Barely any kids are actual runaways. A lot of times they get abducted, even when they are trying to run away they get snatched.\n\nYou know what? Go ahead and cite this from a reputable source. I'll wait.", "You didn\u2019t even spell the baby\u2019s name right.\n\nThe majority of the names on the list you linked to are adults. Yes, children are victims, but overall, it\u2019s very rarely due to a stranger abduction. VERY rare.", "Yes, I believe I've heard of the famous aviator *Lindbergh*. Most of us aren't famous people. We don't have the same security risks as famous people.\n\nAs for your list of people who disappeared mysteriously, the key word there is \"disappeared\" and possibly \"mysteriously\". Were they abducted? Who knows? It's a mystery!", "Japan has much more lenient punishment than  in the US. I am half Japanese and speak Japanese and lived in Japan.\n\nCrime is way, way down. About equivalent to the rate in the 60s. We are much safer now than we were in the 80s and 90s.\n\nKidnapping by strangers is extremely rare. Most kidnappers are friends and family. Stranger Danger kidnaps\u2014 there are about 50 every year in the US.  Exceedingly rare, which is why they make such huge news. If it\u2019s ere so common, no one would make a big deal about it.\n\nHuman trafficking is a very broad and catch all term. So you know that any prostitute under 18 is considered \u201ctrafficked,\u201d regardless of the situation? Also, most trafficking is a boyfriend or husband pimping out their partners for money or drug money. Significant others who trap their partners into hooking is the overwhelming  scenario. The \u201cstranger kidnap and locked in a room and forced to service men\u201d is extremely rare because it\u2019s logistically hard to pull off. I mean, my employer could chain me to my desk and force me to calculate corporate taxes all day but it\u2019s easier to just pay me. Same thing with pimps\u2014 who all meet the definition of \u201ctraffickers.\u201d It\u2019s just easier to pay the willing women than kidnap them.", "When we say that a teenager is being \"trafficked\", all we mean is that they have exchanged sex for cash or goods. We don't necessarily mean that there was a pimp, or that they don't live at home, or that they were abducted.\n\nThis isn't a *good thing*. No child should feel like they have to do this, for any reason. However, on the whole, they're not abducted. They live at home or in foster homes, or they ran away from those homes or foster homes.\n\nAnd we can't help *actual victims* if we pretend that they're in an entirely different situation than the one they're in.", "Correct, it\u2019s not a big deal. Might as well worry about meteorites killing your kid.", "> We arent in japan. And Japan has a lot of cases just like everywhere else.\n\nCite it.", "You are missing the point. They are safer because we have become safer with our kids. There aren\u2019t less people out there prone to hurt kids, there is just less opportunity.", "I do agree with you there, it's only gotten safer but my issue is often with the idea that it was safe before and dangerous now not that these things have always been dangerous but people just started giving a shit to change it finally.\n\nWhile some get carried away in the fear it's obvious by posts like this some parents just aren't fearful enough, we live in a world where we need news segments about leaving a shoe in your backseat so you can remember you child who should be your focus when around is in your backseat.\n\nThe world is safer because we have been making it that way by protecting our children and other people's children with laws and news segments hoping they do the right thing instead of following in their shitty parents foot steps because they \"turned out fine\" spoiler: they didn't or they wouldn't think this was okay.\n\nI just don't think the answer to things getting safer is to stop putting forth the effort because it's working.", "And in addition to the 24 news cycle on TV, we have these horrible boxes in our pockets that often just blast us with the worst news imaginable about the world, without the the type of context you\u2019re referring to.", "They simply are not safer and if you would like to show a link to this evidence I\u2019ll be glad to look at but kids have more dangers in different ways, the internet has become a breeding ground for the abuse of children, women and men. Drugs, gangs semi automatic weapons, kids might not be getting hit by cars much these days but they are being left in hot cars, there is not lower rates of \u201calmost all death and child crimes\u2026\u201d.", "I get what you're saying, but if the mom is worried about her young child walking in the city by himself, I think it's horrible for the dad to just let him do it and then get the kid to hide it from her.", "Who said he's cooped up? Why assume that it's an either/or situation?", "Ahhh\u2026ignorance is bliss. And the desire to remain ignorant is deliberately messed up. \n\nAll is well with people like you, until it happens to you. It\u2019s okay with you if a few kids get kidnapped, as long as it\u2019s not yours or someone you love, right?", "I\u2019m not sure who this we is but when I say a teenager is being trafficked it actually means that they are being exploited and traded like cattle and pimped out to any animal that pays to treat these human beings like things. Of course it\u2019s not a good thing!", "And teenagers being pressured to do survival sex work is very, very different than a prepubescent child being kidnapped and \u2018sold.\u2019", "Nor will you even try, correct? It\u2019s okay for all this to happen because it doesn\u2019t happen to you or to anyone you love, right? \n\nAre you even capable of loving or being loved?", "No, all violent crime is way, way down, across the board", "That's simply untrue.\n\nIt's *always been the case* that if you're going to be the victim of a violent crime, it will most likely be at the hands of somebody you know - typically a family member.\n\nThis is as true for children as it is for anybody else. Crimes against children by strangers have *always* been rare.", "If he's not allowed to have an appropriate level of freedom and independence, he's cooped up.", "\"We\" here means the people who put out information on trafficking.\n\nMost \"trafficked\" teens, iirc, don't have a pimp. No middleman.\n\nAgain, it's not *good*, but we can't solve a problem unless we accurately identify it. Wringing our hands about the largely imaginary risk of kidnapping keeps us from helping people who are *actually being harmed*.", "Yes. Again, the latter case is - well, if it does happen it's certainly not happening on any large scale in the USA or Canada. Or, honestly, any sort of scale. Stranger abductions in developed nations are *very rare*. (I admit I don't know if they're common outside of the West.)", "Exactly what work have you done to stop trafficking? Because all I see you doing is spreading hysteria on reddit. That's not what I call helpful.", "Yes but you are missing the reason of why it is down. People are more careful. More people lock their doors. People are more cautious about walking alone at night. There is better lighting on most streets. People are more connected now with mobile phones. People are more careful about letting their kids into riskier situations. \n\nDriving is safer now then it used to be 20 years ago, but driving without a seatbelt it just as dangerous as it always was.", "Rare doesn\u2019t mean impossible though. The same (small) number of people in the population who would want to hurt kids 20 years ago is the same as today, but that small number has less opportunity now. That drives the rates down.", "What a ridiculous statement. The kid is 7 years old in a big city. Walking two blocks alone is hardly \"an appropriate level of freedom and independence\". \n\nAnd not wanting him to do that doesn't automatically mean he's kept inside all day, which would be the definition of cooped up.", "Look there is a difference between teens having to traffic themselves in the sex trade to survive and the modern slavery that is human trafficking children, woman and men to participate by force and are bought and sold and destroyed by the selling of human people not just selling sex", "This is an unfounded assumption that you are making, and asserting to be the cause without proof.", "Sure, rare doesn't mean impossible.\n\nFor example, it's not *impossible* that I'll go outside today and get struck by lightning. In fact, there are more people struck by lightning every year than there are stranger abductions. There are more people who die getting stung by bees than there are stranger abductions. Heck, there are even more people every year who die from getting tangled in their own bedsheets than there are stranger abductions!\n\nBut I'm not going to live my life around the faint possibility of that happening, and I'm actually quite scared of lightning, and bees.", "I quite agree, which is why I think that when we're talking about the *very rare crime* of stranger abduction of children in the USA we shouldn't try to drag in statatistics of trafficking to scare people."]}
