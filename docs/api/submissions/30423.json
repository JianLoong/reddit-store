Nope. \n\nAlso, just because you were very independent as a child doesn\u2019t your son is ready for the same (and in a very different environment).

You\u2019re an adult, stop being lazy and walk your son to the store.", "I'm gonna have to lean more towards YTA here.\n\nAs the others have pointed out, you're raising your son in a city, in 2023, there are real risks to just letting your son run off at that age without supervision. I understand what you mean about being raised in a rural area, my father grew up in a rural area also, and most likely similar to you, grew up in a situation where everyone knew everyone in town. Still though, my dad would never have let me run off on my own at that age. A city is much bigger, and you don't always know who your neighbors are or who is hanging around the block.\n\nEven assuming where you live is totally safe, and there's absolutely no risk to your kid going 2 blocks to get some candy at the store, telling your son to keep it a secret is pretty much lying already in a particular way.", "YTA I also grew up rural but there\u2019s a big difference between letting your kid do something unsupervised vs endangering your child. \n\nYes, your 7 year old probably is capable of walking to a store and coming straight home. However, in a more populated area there is a much higher risk of a stranger grabbing your kid and you never seeing them again. It doesn\u2019t matter how \u201ctrustworthy\u201d your kid is, your actually placing your trust in complete strangers not to hurt him.", "Seriously?", "YTA You basically told your son to lie or \u201cOmit the Truth\u201d and you put him in danger. There is no way in Hell that I would let any of my kids walk at that age or even as teenagers by themselves two blocks anywhere. I don\u2019t care how responsible they are or what. These days kids get snatched off the streets in seconds and you wouldn\u2019t know any different. My question is..What are YOU doing that is so important that you can\u2019t take time out of your day and walk with your son to go get \u201ccandy at the 7/11\u201d?! If I were his mom..I wouldn\u2019t trust anything that came out of your mouth from this point on and that\u2019s your own fault.", "YTA Letting your kid out to travel short distances is not a problem. I have a free range kid. My son was out and about at 7, too. I\u2019m also in a city.\n\nThe problem is that you and your ex need to be on the same page. You should have consulted her before letting your kid take the step of venturing out on their own.\n\nNever burden your child with secrets.", "YTA you put your son in DANGER and told him to lie to his mom. Wth is wrong with you", "YTA.  Besides telling a 7-year-old to lie by omission to his mother, two blocks in a city is too far to go and there are too many dangers.  Depending on where you live, this is very likely to be considered child endangerment and if so, you won't have to worry about disagreements with your ex over shared custody because she'll have full custody.", "YTA\n\nKids in the city have to grow up fast, too. We learned fast not to look at someone too long, not to talk to strangers, watch out for needles in the streets, etc. You are severely underestimating the danger, and that's not even touching on teaching your kid that Mom is the enemy.", "YTA a 7yr old needs supervision in a store! Living in the city is very different than rural.", "YTA twofold. Your son could get snatched. Daniel Morcombe was a teen when he was stolen and murdered. Plus you\u2019re teaching your son to lie to his mum. You should do a parenting course to find out how to care for a child appropriately. I\u2019d organise it before she organises to reduce your custody.", "YTA. First, you\u2019re asking your son to hide something from his mother\u2014not technically lying, but you\u2019re still telling him to keep secrets from his parent. Secondly, if you are coparenting a kid, it\u2019s an asshole move to do things that your coparent has specifically asked you not to do (let kid out alone). Third, and I *cannot believe* I have to say this, a kid of seven walking alone in a city is absolutely unsafe. What you did in a rural area during your own childhood does not compare to a 7 year old walking alone for two city blocks in 2023. Honestly, it\u2019s only a matter of time before something happens to your kid if you keep allowing this. If I were the other parent, I\u2019d 100% take you to court over this and have custody rearranged.", "YTA, you\u2019re putting your kid in danger of being abducted, and you\u2019re putting them in danger of being taken advantage. No-one should ever teach a child that it is ok to keep secrets from their parents or have \u201cjust between us\u201d secrets. I don\u2019t think you fully understand what a dangerous precedent you are setting", "YTA\n\nYou said it yourself, times have changed, meaning there is still potential for danger to come, for a seven year old boy who I imagine hasnt been taught in what to do in dangerous situations, but thats not the main point. If I were that ex's friend, I would have walked out to him and ask him a few questions, make sure he was safe, and get him to 7/11 and back home, then called up the mother. Im a mother myself, even back in my day, my own mother would never let me walk by myself without my sister especially (being the exception it was across the street to another friends house). Does your son even have a phone to call for help?? And also, as a mother, I feel agreeable with your ex, you lied to her, and involved your son into keeping it between you, so this is entirely your fault.", "0\\_0\n\nYTA Big time. I live in one of the so-called safest places in EU, and while kids are allowed to mess around where they live at that age, I've never seen a seven-year-old just out in a random park by themselves or allowed to go two blocks to a freaking gas station for candy. This is a stupid decision and you should be reported. Gas stations are extremely busy with cars and people not paying attention, he could be hit or just taken and no one would ever freaking know.", "YTA.  It\u2019s a very different thing for kids to roam in a rural area vs an urban one.  At 7, most kids are still not great at things like street safety that are necessary to going around unsupervised in a city.  I\u2019m turning 40, and grew up in a suburban area - we were allowed to be out on our street (which was deliberately designed short and curvy so only people going to houses on the street would use it) when other kids were around, but we weren\u2019t allowed to go out onto the street that only served our neighborhood at 7, much less out onto any of the more heavily trafficked streets.  The only exception we had was walking to school in the morning, and that was because we walked with the kids a few houses down and there was a crossing guard for the only crossing that wasn\u2019t a short, curved street only used by the folks who lived on it.\n\nCorner stores are also a pretty common location for things you don\u2019t want a 7 year old walking into, even in otherwise safe neighborhoods, like adults drinking in public and drug deals and whatnot.\n\nTelling your son to lie by omission and teaching him that it\u2019s okay to do things his mother says no to if he hides it from her is its own problem, and not a small one.  It\u2019s definitely not the way to raise an honest and trustworthy son.  Remember that most humans generalize lessons, so if it\u2019s okay to hide this thing his parent disapproves of, it\u2019s also okay to hide other things one (or both) of his parents disapproves of.  That\u2019s a slippery slope that gets ugly fast.", "YTA\n\nNot for wanting your kid to have some freedom and responsibility, although I question your way of going about it (very irresponsible!), but for telling your kid to lie to his mother.\n\nAlso: a city now is nowhere near comparable to your rural upbringings then.", "YTA \n\nIt\u2019s entirely too many sickos out here for you to think letting a 7 year old child walk two blocks to a 7/11 a convenience store where all types of weirdos hang out.

I Started taking the bus (public) to and from school which was 30 min away from home at the age of 6. Most parents allowed theirs kids to do it because it was safe.

This is no different except the potential predators are in the street and approach kids in a friendly trustworthy manner.

It is absolutely much much safer now. What HAS changed is the 24 hour news cycle has you convinced that everything is terrifying and more dangerous when it used to be, when in fact the opposite is true. \n\nChild abductions have dropped 40% in the last two decades, even though our population has increased by a third\u2014that makes the drop actually less than 40%. \n\nBetween 1993 and 2013, the number of kids injured or killed by being struck by a vehicle fell by about 2/3.\n\nBetween 1993 and 2004, violent assaults against children fell by 2/3.

His mother doesn\u2019t agree with this, but in my mind I\u2019m free to do my parenting choices, just as she is. I just asked my son not to mention anything so as not so start trouble (important to say, I didn\u2019t ask him to lie to his mother, just to keep his short walks between us). \n\nWell, one of my ex\u2019s friends who also lives in the neighborhood saw my son walking alone by the park. My ex called me to say I was putting our kid in danger and called me an AH for making him keep this from her (because of course I told her it wasn\u2019t the first time, as a way to show he\u2019s responsible and has proved to be trustworthy with the small freedoms I give him).

Groups of kids can pick on kids alone.  \n\nHe isn\u2019t old enough, or big enough, to have to prove himself trustworthy or responsible.

Kidnapping aside, letting a kid that young walk alone for a few blocks, where I'm assuming there could be traffic and other things around like the mentioned park, goes well untill it doesnt. He could be as bright as a bulb, the smartest 7yo around, but they just dont have the ability to rationally assess the actual danger and consequenses of a lot of situations, especially if they seem shiny and fun.\n\nAs for kidnapping, I have no idea how likely that is in your area. If someone were to do it, I would think it would be easier to target a kid they've seen walking alone and unsupervised on the regulare.\n\nYou are also telling your kid to hide things from his mom because you dont want to deal with the conflict your choises is a part of creating. You are putting your kid in the middle of a parental conflict, making him responsible for not telling mommy so she will be mad at daddy.

What was safe 20 years ago may not be safe now. 2) Urban areas are very different from rural areas. Levels of safety are very different. Two blocks is a long way in an urban area for a 7 yr old to be walking and anything can happen. 3) Allowing your 7 yr old to walk more than a few doors down alone is something that should have absolutely been run by his mother. Just because you two aren\u2019t in a relationship anymore, doesn\u2019t mean either of you can parent as you see fit without ever consulting the other. 4) You did ask your son to lie to his mother. You put him in a terrible position because you obviously knew his mother wouldn\u2019t be okay with what you\u2019re doing. 5) Her fears have nothing to do with whether or your son is trustworthy. They\u2019re about all of the other dangers lurking out there, and there are many. I mean, have you ever turned on the news or opened a newspaper? Or even just noticed the articles that pop up when you open google? I hope you\u2019ve spoken to your son about what can happen while he\u2019s out alone, but frankly you don\u2019t strike me as the type who would. You strike me as the type who just thought \u201cI\u2019m feeling lazy and don\u2019t want to walk with him and it was safe when I was his age so\u2026.\u201d and then just sent him on his way without considering the very real consequences.

I've watched way too many kids who are under 10 literally cross the street without ever checking to see if there are cars coming. Even without the \"stranger danger\" possibility, cities are dangerous just for the amount of traffic a kid would need to navigate. When I was 18, a 7-year-old was killed across from my old Elementary school because he tried to cross the road alone and stepped right in front of a car that hit and killed him. I was away at college at the time and practically had a heart attack because the local TV news mispronounced his last name as my last name so I thought it had been one of my cousins. Scariest freaking minute of my life calling home to find out it wasn't any of my cousins.\n\nSo while I support letting kids have some freedom and age-appropriate independence and not being too overprotective like my Mom was, I don't think any parent could live with themselves if their kid was hit abd killed by a car while walking a few blocks alone or, God forbid, got abducted or something.\n\nAnd, of course, doing it behind the Mom's back knowing she wouldn't approve and essentially telling the kid to hide it from his Mom is a major asshole move. My Mom was super overprotective and my Dad was way more chill because he grew up on a farm, but they discussed things like me going out alone and my Dad teaching ne to drive at 14 because they were jointly my parents and had equal say in my upbringing. OP claims to be co-parenting their son but he doesn't seem to understand the actual meaning of that word because he's clearly acting like a single parent, there's no cooperation between him and his ex which just makes it bad all around for the kid. OP needs to act like an adult, realize his mistakes, and kearn from them while working on his communication skills with his ex so they can be consistent in parenting their 7-year-old who already has to move between two different homes, meaning stability between the two homes abd oarents is even more important.\n\nAlso, OP's actions could make his ex decide to try to change their custody agreement because he's proven she can't trust him with their son, and telling the kid to lie by omission to his Mom is probably not going to look good in the judge's eyes and he could easily view it as you unnecessarily endangering your son just to spite his Mom's rules against letting him walk through the city alone \n\nAlso, OP, you may think your son proved on previous excursions alone to be responsible enough in your eyes, but you're overlooking that it's others around him who might not be responsible or trustworthy. I was never allowed to walk to/from the bus stop alone as a kid despite living in a rural area because shortly before I was born, an 8-year-old girl got off the school bus on a rural side road and never made it the 50 feet to her driveway. She still has never been found 38 years later and the police have 0 leads other than a distinctive van seen near the bus stop around that time. I wasn't aware of the case as a kid and always thought it was stupid and insulting that my Mom refused to let 10-year-old me walk home from the bus stop across the street alone, but I understand her fear now because the unthinkable did happen in the relative safety of a rural small town and if it happened once, it could happen again. And my Mom wasn't about to risk losing her daughter when she was able to meet me at the bus stop every day.", "Yeah.

Most of the remaining 5% are cases where a noncustodial parent has the child. Far fewer than 1% are stranger or acquaintance kidnappings. Yet parents are still on hyper-alert, convinced that a child of 7 can't safely walk down the block. Child abduction rates are no higher than in the 1960s, when parents routinely let kids walk alone to school or sent them to buy milk at the convenience store, but parents' fears have skyrocketed. \n\nThe OP is still YTA because he told his child to keep a secret from his mother.
