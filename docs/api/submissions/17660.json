She cheated on you. She left. You never intended to have any contact with her again. You had no reason to keep her image in your life.\n\nHer family chose not to take any pictures of or with her for 15 years. I'm very sorry for their loss but it's not rational to have expected you to keep these photos. I'm sure they are acting now out of grief and disappointment and their anger in that situation is somewhat predictable, but I don't know how your friends can be calling you an asshole.", "I say NTA. I also got rid of ALL photos of my ex husband and I when we split up. I literally have no photos at all of us, not even on a usb, and I\u2019m totally okay with that. You had no idea that she would pass away. It\u2019s just one of those crazy situations.", "NTA. You were under no obligation to keep all the pictures. If she hadn't passed away, no one would've cared the photos were gone. You couldn't have known her family had no photos and that they might've taken the photos instead of destroying them.", "**NTA**\n\n1.  You entitled to do whatever you choose with your possessions. \n\n2. While they are grieving and understandably trying to find anything they can regarding her image or memory, It is incredibly unrealistic for them to expect you to have anything left of hers months after she left you for someone else.  No sense in getting into a back and forth with them though.\n\nYou have nothing, they know it. I would simply stop communicating with them.  Flat out.", "NTA\n\nShe no longer wanting the pictures and neither did you. First thing I did when I got rid of my husband was erase him from everything", "NTA. She left you, if the pictures meant anything to her she would have taken them or asked for them. Her family is hurt and grieving, understandable, but not your fault at all. FYI when my ex left me I got rid of everything as well, so I don't think what you did was extreme either.", "NTA.  Those were your photos and obviously, cheating ex didn't care about them.    \n\n\nAwful actions sometimes have unintended consequences.", "NTA she removed you from her life and you removed her from yours in return.", "Well, She didn't wanted pics, you neither, so...nta, you are not a server or a storage.", "Under the circumstances, of course it's NTA.  The same judgment would apply even if you burned them as an effigy made of photo prints as well as deleting the image files.  But grief sucks, and not just for those experiencing it.    Anyone who has a problem with you is experiencing the grief or is a contrarian idiot.", "NTA. She hurt you and you wanted to remove the reminders of that hurt. You had no way of knowing what would happen in the future. It's rough for her family, but that isn't on you. They're just in pain and lashing out at someone who has done something tangible.", "NTA. Honestly this woman cheated on you and left you. She never asked for the pictures and left them behind. It is completely reasonable for you to delete photos of her. Lots of people do this post breakup. You did this because I\u2019m sure seeing the photos was painful. You didn\u2019t do this after she was dead or something. You weren\u2019t being vindictive.\n\nHer family is grieving and not really thinking rationally. And not having photos is probably a huge loss for them\u2026 and you are an easy target for their pain. But this is not your fault. Do what you can to keep your distance and not engage with them. You can empathize but you don\u2019t have to listen to their angry words. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss too. Even though this relationship ended in the worst way, you were with her for 10 years. That\u2019s a huge part of your life. It\u2019s okay to morn even people who hurt you. Please try and be kind to yourself and consider talking to someone because what you are going through must be very difficult. Maybe more so than you realize yet.", "NTA. It is what it is. I\u2019m not sure why there are recriminations on her family\u2019s part. She wasn\u2019t interested in your photos.  She didn\u2019t take any. They didn\u2019t ask\n\nI completely understand why you did it.  You are angry.  I would be too.", "Nta, she left them because she didn't like photos of herself.  Her family could have chosen to ask for copies of the photos, I'm sure they saw them all over your home.  You did what you did out of a form of healing.  It's definitely unfortunate what happened to her after everything was destroyed.  But not something you predicted happening.", "NTA they were yours and you can do with them whatever you want", "NTA. She left you and left the pictures behind. You're not obligated to keep pictures of her. Her parents can ask the new boyfriend for recent pictures. I won't say they are AH for berating you, they just lost their daughter so I won't judge that. But I don't think that someone can be guilty for not keeping photos of an ex.", "NTA - Just an unfortunate situation all around.\n\nDestroying photos is a fairly common way of coping with the loss of a relationship, though if it were me, I may have taken some and laid them in a box or on a USB drive like your parents suggested and packed it off to decide if I still felt like destroying them later on after the cycle of grief had taken its course. Having said that, we all deal with that cycle in our own way and that is how you needed to proceed to cope at the time.\n\nHer passing was tragic and unexpected. While it would have been nice for her family to have more photos, it's not reasonable for them to expect that you should or would have held onto a memento that reminded you of a bad relationship ending.", "Info. Do your parents still have any pictures of your ex-wife? Even if she didn\u2019t like being photographed, perhaps there might still be some photos of her from family gatherings. \n\nIt might be worth asking your parents to look through their photos from the last few years and see if there is anything they can send on to your ex-wife\u2019s parents.", "Nta\n\nWhy would anyone assume you'd keep *any* of the pictures of the woman that, at the bare minimum, had an emotional affair, and then left you?!", "1. If she hadn't died, everybody would have understood you for destroying all the pictures.\n2. Also, it's 2023, everybody has smartphones and pictures are being taken non-stop.\n3. None of her relatives have any pictures of her from the last 15 years? How close were they really?\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nThey were yours to keep or destroy and given how the relationship ended I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting them around", "NTA, you could not have seen that coming, and her family left you to be blindsided, you owe those assholes nothing. If they didn't get any pictures that's on them.\n\nAlso, the petty in me doesn't want you to fix the typo:\n\n LoL they have are a couple of wedding pictures be pictures from high school.", "NTA- I think it's a common thing people do after a break up. They want to remove the memory of their previous partner. You couldn't anticipate her passing, if the photos were so valuable to her family, they should've asked for the years ago.", "NTA.  Maybe they can see the wedding photographer for more of those pictures .", "NTA- they can go to her affair partner for pictures.\n\nThe nerve of these people to hide her affair and then ask you for all the memorabilia she turned her back on .", "I\u2019ve always destroyed pictures of my ex\u2019s after break ups (I mean I probably wouldn\u2019t if it ended well but 99% of the time it\u2019s cheating so no\u2026)", "NTA - ASSUMING YOU DON\u2019T HAVE KIDS. She could have took them. If you don\u2019t have kids there\u2019s no reason your should feel pressured to hold on to this baggage. \n\nHer family is grieving and is vilifying you. I wouldn\u2019t think too much of it or actually take it seriously that you did anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nSo her family is okay with her cheating on her husband but you are an AH for getting rid of pics after she left you? Ah no. Tell them to use their own pics.", "Nah - they're grieving her death and wasn't expecting that information. You were grieving the betrayal/end of your marriage.", "NAH\n\nI feel really, really bad for them. So I get they are coming from a place of pain which is why I am giving them some slack.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut you didn't know she was going to die and that they would want them.", "NTA. But maybe you still have negatives from old pics you can give them, if it makes you feel better.", "Huge NTA", "NTA but you do sound a lot insensitive. She\u2019s dead and her family is mourning her, but you sound like you\u2019re happy you could one up them on this. You had every right to get rid of the pictures but you don\u2019t need to be insensitive about it. Losing a kid is always horrific.

On a memory stick, or a usb? if film maybe the negatives? or maybe they can get into her old laptop or computer to see if any are still stored. It takes a lot to completely delete pictures from everywhere if they were digital.

I don't think you were wrong but I would try to find something for them.", "Nta, you didn't deny her or her family access to  those pictures. She didn't want them, and you got rid of them. You are not there storage.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. I see why they\u2019re upset not to have any pictures from 15 years but it\u2019s by far not your fault.
