I first met her when she was 10. We got along very well from the moment that we met and I love her just as much as I love my own daughter(2F).\n\nEventhough her school provides lunch, the food is terrible so I pack her lunch everyday. It also helps us bond as she sometimes helps me cook for her lunch and we like to make and try new foods.\n\nShe spends one week with us and one week with her mom and recently she has been complaining that her mom forces her to eat the school's lunch. I tried talking to her mom and told her how much she hates the school lunch and suggested she should do what we do.\n\nShe suddenly got mad and started to angrily tell me that I have no idea how hard it is to be a single mom of 3 kids and that unlike me who am \"a gold digger who doesn't even work\" she doesn't have extra time to spend on making lunch\n\nI got mad and told her that eventhough I have a toddler I manage to be a good mom to my stepdaughter so she needs to stop making excuses for  being a shitty mom.\n\nShe called me an asshole(and many other names) and ended the call\n\nEdit: no I wasn't the affair partner they have been divorced for a year when I met my husband. No we don't have a huge age gap he is 41 and I'm 34. No I never say anything bad about her to my stepdaughter\n\nIt's not my dault that she has decided to be a shitty mom and drive her child away. She can't even spend an hour a day or even an hour a week with my stepdaughter. Of course my stepdaughter doesn't feel loved by her. Of course she'd rather be somewhere that everyone loves her and spends time with her. Nobody is asking her to pack lunch everyday but is it so hard to do it once a month just to make her child happy?\n\nFinal edit: everyone is so biased and sees ger as a \"poor single mom\" so I won't answer anymore. I love my stepdaughter and will do anything to make her happy so I will take food to her school for her everyday and this \"poor woman\" that you are all defending allows her kids to bully my child(yes my child because I love her and she calls me mom) however I don't think me bringing food for her will solve anything because all she wants is to spend time with her mom like she does with me. This woman hardly ever spends any time with her, she even missed all of her basketball games while she has never missed a single one of her sons games. She always finds time to spend with her sons but never with her daughter and my child deserves better than this", "created_utc": 1681460552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lpjws/aita_asking_my_stepdaughters_mom_to_pack_her_lunch/", "score": 382, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus, the girl is 14 and old enough to make her own lunch, she does not need to be babied.\n\nSecond, she works and has 3 kids.   Thinking that your situation with fewer kids and the luxury of staying at home is even remotely equivalent as a challenge shows that you are completely clueless.  \n\nThird, it takes a heck of a lot of gall to tell a child's ACTUAL mom who is fully involved in her life that you are a better mom to her child than she is.", "YTA\n\nTelling her she is a shitty mom because she expects her daughter to eat the school-provided food?

You have no idea how hard that is.", "Look, I mean this sincerely as the child of divorce and blended families;  if you want to be a good parent to this child you need to change your attitude towards her mother.  14 year old may have lots of shit to say about her mom, and you clearly judge this woman severely, but your job is to try and be neutral like Switzerland.  \n\nLove the kid, nurture her, and try your best to be kind and cordial towards the rest of your stepdaughter\u2019s family.", "YTA - Oo boy.

PERFECT example of how not everybody is the same. The school provides food and the child isn\u2019t being forced to starve.

A single mom is someone who\u2019s child\u2019s father is not In the picture, this child\u2019s father clearly is. Saying she has 3 children so it\u2019s harder, op as already claimed they are older then the girl, meaning older then 14, so at school all day, and presumably has friends and after school activities. Op has also stated the mother does nothing to spend time with the child, the child spends 1 week at moms and 1 week at dads, but mother doesn\u2019t call her when she\u2019s at the dads?? Dont get me wrong, she\u2019s 14 and can make her own lunches for school, but it seems to me from the post, for the child it\u2019s more about the time spend together making the lunches, then the actual lunch itself.

She may very well be a horrible mother (I don\u2019t know), but if she is, please recognize that it isn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t pack her daughter\u2019s lunch. Being a single mom is HARD (even if her kids are older). Single mothers never get breaks. I also assume that she works outside the home\u2026which makes parenting that much harder. Instead of judging her for (relatively small things) that she isn\u2019t doing or calling her a bad mom, try to have a bit more compassion.

Leave that woman alone.", "YTA I don't know why you thought this was your place at all. Your stepdaughter is not being harmed in any way by having to sometimes eat school lunches. Also, at 14 she's MORE than capable of packing her own lunches. *That's* what you should have suggested she try rather than attacking and insulting her mother to prove your self-proclaimed superiority.", "Yikes lady, you\u2019re seriously overstepping. It does not make her  *a shitty mom*  to not pack her fourteen year old a special lunch. The woman works and has three kids, the daughter is well able to pack her own lunch.

Same option my kid gets cuz it's too expensive packing a lunch everyday. \nI'm not even gonna touch on how hard doing it alone vs having a partner to help. That shit is obvious.

I'm a daughter of separate parents since ever and if I came to complain about feeling neglected by any of them and someone answered trying to force a good relationship in that moment instead of really listening, I'd feel that my feelings and complaints are being invalidated and I would become even angrier with said parent (that's what happened when I was a teenager). Y'all talking as single parents that think y'all know what is effective for a kid of separate parents. I'm talking as the kid of separate parents that this is not effective at all. Stepmother is doing great with stepdaughter. And she's asking about her behaviour towards the mom, not towards anyone else. \n\nBut OP, you can't force her mom to be the way you want her to be.

You are just dad's new toy. \n\nAnd she must be a pretty decent mum if your fancy lawyers couldn't get you more than that.", "As she gets older, will the court take your stepdaughter's wishes where to live into account?", "When did you go to court? Your stepdaughter is 14, if she wants to live with you and her father full time they\u2019ll take what she wants into a lot more consideration than when children are younger. My dad went back to court when I was about that age and he got full custody because that\u2019s what I wanted.", "I'm saying you found one detail that can be explained in other ways and haven't actually given any evidence for this bullying. You're just relying on insults and incredibly mysoginistic behaviour (that whole \"she should have chosen a better dad for her other kids\" attitude you keep slinging) to fit your narrative. \n\nYou sound like a peach. A rotten one. Do you have any actual friends or is your stepdaughter your one point of contact?", "You're not bullying her mother or anything", "No they were both target insults made to make each other feel like shit. Once things devolve into insults I dont really see how one insult is different from another one.", "If I don't call her one day she will call me crying and say I don't love her as much as I love my daughter\n\nAlso there are 24 hours a day and I don't spend all of it talking to her", "If she calls me mom and introduces me as mom to everyone then I'm her mom", "If this is her best then shouldn't have had more kids than she can manage", "I don't have a problem with that I can send her food and money if that's what she wants\n\nWhat is child anionisation?", "The 4 numbers at the end is always a dead giveaway on here", "[deleted]", "You didn't answer my question\n\nShould we ignore the bullying becasue \"her poor single mom\"?", "Honey, you have a saviour complex. That is not healthy behaviour for a child to get so upset over missing one call and you're not actually helping by buying into it, your creating a codependent child who will only rely on you for comfort. That's not being a loving parent, that's using a child for your ego boost.", "This child needs therapy, not a manipulative stepmother.", "also you seem to attached to your stepdaughter\n\nshe has a mum she does not need you to be stop trying to control her\n\nget over the fact your husband had a child with his ex the jealousy is insane", "Your stepdaughter seems very dependent on you. It is not normal to cry because you didnt call her for one day and it is not normal to think that no call equals no love. This girl needs therapy. You, her mother and your husband need to co parent better", "You are not her mother. Accept that.", "No you\u2019re not!!\nShe has a mother, you are a step mother. End of", "nope nope nope\n\nshe has a mum who has shared custody \n\nshe has a mum because your husband put his penis into his ex and cum in her getting her pregnant\n\nway before he did you", "Her parenting in a different way than you is not her unable to manage her children. It means you're different people. Your misogyny is really showing.", "Not making a 'special' lunch for a kid that gets lunch at school is not having more kids than she can manage. Keep your disgusting judgment to yourself, asshole.", "Look at this sanctimommy, throwing her misogyny around.\n\nI wish for you everything you deserve.", "Yet another 4 letter word", "She probably managed a lot better before being a single mom. You should really shut the hell up as you've never been a single mom to 3. You only have 1 kid all of the time. It's easy to act better than someone who has more difficult circumstances than you. And btw THAT IS NOT YOUR CHILD STOP PUTTING A DIVIDE BETWEEN HER AND HER ACTUAL MOM. All bringing lunch to the school is is you trying to one up her mom and make her look bad. She's 14 she can pack her own lunches. Stop acting like she's a baby who can't do anything for herself.", "How did she have those kids? It\u2019s not like she did it all by herself, and she wasn\u2019t counting on raising them by herself, either. Her circumstances changed, and retroactively blaming her for having \u201ctoo many\u201d is unfair in itself. It\u2019s downright cruel when you\u2019re married to the man who left her with those three kids.", "OH MY GOD! You are evil!!!\nMaybe she is a shitty mother but don't fool yourself - you are not better than her. All your comments are simply disgusting! You don't like this woman and you are very judgy of her.", "She was married (and therefore had help) when she had those kids. Being a single mom of three probably wasn\u2019t her plan.", "Parental alienation is a strategy whereby one parent intentionally displays to the child unjustified negativity aimed at the other parent. The purpose of this strategy is to damage the child's relationship with the other parent and to turn the child's emotions against that other parent.\n\nCafcass, the government body tasked with assisting the Courts in Children Matter proceedings, defines parental alienation as follows: \u201cwhen a child's resistance or hostility towards one parent is not justified and is the result of psychological manipulation by the other parent.\u201d", "Alienation. Deliberately interfering in such a way that you set the child up against their birth parent. Aka: what you are doing.\n\nYou sure you're not the affair partner? Cause you have the same attitude. \"She just didn't know how to care for him, I love him best!!!!\" \n\nAlso kinda giving off pick me vibes there. Must be nice to have one kid to deal with, be a SAHM and not have to handle everything else on your own whilst judging other women.", "She doesn't need your money or your food. \n\nYour SD is not going to die because she has to eat other food that the lunches you make her.\n\nAnd if you're so worried about it, why don't you teach the kid to make her own lunches. She's 14 for fuck's sake.", "I don't get it?", "this comes from the same person who just had to edit their comment, correct? but i\u2019d say its well within the definition.", "Is bullying being told no? Is bullying being made to share time with her siblings? Is it bullying that her mother has to work and can't spoil the child with whatever she wants?", "So far the evidence you have of bullying is a bruise \n\nI have bruises that I literally nfi where they came from.", "Should we ignore your bullying of her mum?", "So I should tell her not to call me mom? Way to make her feel like she doesn't belong in our family", "I agree with you but... End of what?", "My 5 year old is covered in bruises but then again so am I, we are just both very clumsy people"]}
