No we don't have a huge age gap he is 41 and I'm 34. No I never say anything bad about her to my stepdaughter\n\nIt's not my dault that she has decided to be a shitty mom and drive her child away. She can't even spend an hour a day or even an hour a week with my stepdaughter. Of course my stepdaughter doesn't feel loved by her. Of course she'd rather be somewhere that everyone loves her and spends time with her. Nobody is asking her to pack lunch everyday but is it so hard to do it once a month just to make her child happy?\n\nFinal edit: everyone is so biased and sees ger as a \"poor single mom\" so I won't answer anymore. I love my stepdaughter and will do anything to make her happy so I will take food to her school for her everyday and this \"poor woman\" that you are all defending allows her kids to bully my child(yes my child because I love her and she calls me mom) however I don't think me bringing food for her will solve anything because all she wants is to spend time with her mom like she does with me. This woman hardly ever spends any time with her, she even missed all of her basketball games while she has never missed a single one of her sons games. She always finds time to spend with her sons but never with her daughter and my child deserves better than this", "created_utc": 1681460552, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12lpjws/aita_asking_my_stepdaughters_mom_to_pack_her_lunch/", "score": 4603, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus, the girl is 14 and old enough to make her own lunch, she does not need to be babied.\n\nSecond, she works and has 3 kids.   Thinking that your situation with fewer kids and the luxury of staying at home is even remotely equivalent as a challenge shows that you are completely clueless.  \n\nThird, it takes a heck of a lot of gall to tell a child's ACTUAL mom who is fully involved in her life that you are a better mom to her child than she is.", "YTA\n\nTelling her she is a shitty mom because she expects her daughter to eat the school-provided food?

She is a single mom. You are not. You have no idea how hard that is.", "Look, I mean this sincerely as the child of divorce and blended families;  if you want to be a good parent to this child you need to change your attitude towards her mother.  14 year old may have lots of shit to say about her mom, and you clearly judge this woman severely, but your job is to try and be neutral like Switzerland.  \n\nLove the kid, nurture her, and try your best to be kind and cordial towards the rest of your stepdaughter\u2019s family.", "YTA - Oo boy.

A single mom is someone who\u2019s child\u2019s father is not In the picture, this child\u2019s father clearly is. Saying she has 3 children so it\u2019s harder, op as already claimed they are older then the girl, meaning older then 14, so at school all day, and presumably has friends and after school activities. Op has also stated the mother does nothing to spend time with the child, the child spends 1 week at moms and 1 week at dads, but mother doesn\u2019t call her when she\u2019s at the dads?? Dont get me wrong, she\u2019s 14 and can make her own lunches for school, but it seems to me from the post, for the child it\u2019s more about the time spend together making the lunches, then the actual lunch itself.

She may very well be a horrible mother (I don\u2019t know), but if she is, please recognize that it isn\u2019t because she doesn\u2019t pack her daughter\u2019s lunch. Being a single mom is HARD (even if her kids are older). Single mothers never get breaks. I also assume that she works outside the home\u2026which makes parenting that much harder.

It does not make her  *a shitty mom*  to not pack her fourteen year old a special lunch. The woman works and has three kids, the daughter is well able to pack her own lunch.

I'm a daughter of separate parents since ever and if I came to complain about feeling neglected by any of them and someone answered trying to force a good relationship in that moment instead of really listening, I'd feel that my feelings and complaints are being invalidated and I would become even angrier with said parent (that's what happened when I was a teenager). Y'all talking as single parents that think y'all know what is effective for a kid of separate parents. I'm talking as the kid of separate parents that this is not effective at all. Stepmother is doing great with stepdaughter. And she's asking about her behaviour towards the mom, not towards anyone else. \n\nBut OP, you can't force her mom to be the way you want her to be.

My bio mom was not (still love her though). My stepmom was a hard working mother, had her own children full time, but still made time and effort for my siblings and I. I never once heard her utter a single bad thing about my mom. My mom was constantly speaking horrible of my dad and stepmom, pretty sure she was just bitter that my dad was happy and built a life with someone after she had cheated on him.  My bio mom just straight up couldn\u2019t be bothered to care about me, she cared about my sisters, but for some reason she just decided I wasn\u2019t worth the effort. She treated me completely different than the others. I eventually moved in with my dad and stepmom when I was old enough to choose. My stepmom made me feel loved and cared for, I was allowed to be a kid when I was with her we spent amazing quality time together as a family and separately. \nMy mom worked, not even close to as much as my stepmom, she never had like an actual job. She lived with her AP and they both treated me pretty terrible, my siblings were too young to understand (we are actually close in age but this all started when I was 8) and they generally got along with him because they also didn\u2019t comprehend that he was only 10 years older than me\u2026 So that\u2019s a whole other issue.\n\nMy bio mom eventually apologized when I was like 26 for the way she treated me. She admitted that she built up some resentment towards me because I understood what had happened. My sisters and I are close, every now and then they text me in the group chat about how sorry they are for how I was treated as a kid and how much they appreciate me and now that they\u2019re older they understand why I was so miserable and went to live with my dad. My mom liked to get them to join in on taunting me, or they didn\u2019t realize she would use them to hurt my feelings by singling me out. For example-letting them all sleep with her during like storms that scared us, but not me, or giving them all a ride to school but making me walk even though my school was farther than my sisters but in the same direction (you have to pass their school to get to mine). I would have to walk in the snow with regular sneakers and jeans. My step-mom would see me walking occasionally while she was picking up my stepbrothers and give me a ride and this infuriated my mom. My mom would take my siblings out for things like ice cream or treats but I wasn\u2019t allowed to join. She\u2019s or her AP would come home with treats and would make my sisters eat them in front of me while saying things like, \u201cdon\u2019t you wish you could have some\u201d. They went to all their games, but not mine. Just was not a good environment for me.\n\nSome people just can\u2019t fathom that a stepmom can be a better parent than a bio mom. To this day I\u2019m much closer to my dad and especially my stepmom. I have ZERO qualms with her calling me HER daughter. Because I am. She probably did think my mom was a shitty mom, but I still at 31 would never know.

Still, it is such poor behavior on OP's part that she attack her stepdaughter's mom's parenting.

This stepmother packs the teen\u2019s lunches. Cool. Who is primarily raising her? Dad didn\u2019t even come up here, so my guess is it\u2019s not him. \n\nWho makes sure she\u2019s up to date on vaccines? Who fills out all the school forms? Who scheduled her dental cleanings? Who goes to parent/teacher conferences? Who makes sure the daughter has gym clothes and tampons and a hair appointment for the homecoming dance and all those things that most dads in straight relationships never have to think about? I\u2019d be curious to know the answers to Qs like that in OP\u2019s household. Is she doing that for stepdaughter? Is her husband, Teen\u2019s father? Or is it falling on the mother? \n\nIf it\u2019s the father, great! Maybe they really are parenting 50/50. If it\u2019s the stepmother, she needs to acknowledge that she\u2019s doing the work that ought to be her husband\u2019s (and his ex\u2019s) and note that he has it easier because of her.

That's because it's more appropriate the girl's FATHER raises it, as he and the mother are the girl's legal parents (who each have equal custody).\n\nOP just comes across as a bit too big for her boots throughout. It feels territorial against the ex, rather than constructive. It's clear OP believes she is on equal/superior footing to the girl's own mother. All the way through OP refers to the stepdaughter as HER child, claims to love her more, feels she therefore has a right to directly interfere in the mother's parenting (of OP's 'child'), etc. All this despite only being in the girl's life for 4 years.\n\nWho knows? Maybe some of OP's points about the mother are valid. But OP DOESN'T come across as a reliable narrator. She is kicking up a destructive fuss (on issues which should instead be raised by the girl's father), over things that are mainly just a difference in parenting decisions. She seems to apply the harshest judgement possible throughout the post/edits, of the mother (even equating giving the girl school dinners, to 'not loving her'). \n\nOP doesn't seem willing to consider the mother's viewpoint (such as whether the mother's struggling with anything, or whether it's patronising to tell her how to parent in this manner, etc.). Indeed, OP's only conclusion is she's a 'shitty Mom', who 'doesn't love' (OP's) child. OP even says she won't consider commentators' viewpoints any further, because they are also trying to understand the mother's viewpoint. \n\nSo you wonder how much some of the other 'charges' against the mother, are fair interpretation. Such as whether the mother really DOESN'T spend as much time with her daughter as her sons (who knows? Maybe commitments have genuinely clashed in the past, preventing the mother attending an event of her daughter's - which OP is cherrypicking. After all, OP seems to exaggerate on occasion. She starts by saying the mother has the girl every other week - then later claims, she doesn't spend 'an hour a week' with the girl.)\n\nIn addition, OP was hardly constructive when the fight escalated (another reason she shouldn't be handling these parenting issues, but instead should leave it to the girl's father). According to OP, she wants to 'make HER (OP' s) child happy', by getting the mother to make packed lunches. But how is it going to be effective, to put the mother on the defensive - and openly call her a 'bad Mom' to her face?! \n\nEven if the mother traded insults first (and given OP's bias, we can't know that), OP showed no desire to be constructive/de-escalate the fight. It just seems throughout, OP is bossy enough to believe the mother 'must' do what OP does - or she's an 'unfit' mother.

YTA x 1000.", "You seem a little too eager to fuel the resentment that most teenage girls have with their mums.YTA", "Hoo-boy. YTA. First of all, I don\u2019t care how much of a shitty mom you think she is, you NEVER talk to her like that. You overstepped your place BIG time by telling her mom she should be packing her lunch and \u201cdo what you do.\u201d The SD is old enough to either pack her own lunch, or communicate with her mother HERSELF that she wants her to pack her lunch. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a big difference between a working single mom with 3 kids compared to a stay at home mom of 2. You have a LOT more spare time than she does. \n\nI don\u2019t care if the SD calls you mom, you are not mom.  Stay in your lane. \n\nSource: am a stepmom and a bio mom. Would never talk to my sd\u2019s mom like this even though I too think she\u2019s a shitty mom.", "you are the asshole, its not your place to call your step daughters mother for any reason other than emergencies. Unless harm is being done, the girls mother can parent in a different way and that is okay. The 14 year old has learned lots of cooking skills from you now, so if she wants to practice preparing her own lunches at her moms she should ask her mom herself about getting ingredients for that preparation.", "It\u2019s great she\u2019s has you to love and care for her as her own. But it\u2019s important to remember that she isn\u2019t yours. If you want to continue having a healthy relationship with your step-daughter, you\u2019d know how much it hurts for you to keep pointing out her mother\u2019s flaws. If you want to be a good step mom you should know that having a healthy relationship with her mom and you is what\u2019s best. Someday she will come to resent you or distrust you or feel unsafe. Her mom is an extension of her so when you speak badly about mom you\u2019re also hurting your step-daughter. YTA. You can do better.", "Esh but soft s for you. Been a step kid to an asshole evil stepparent and You are not that. I understand your position, innocently telling bio mom hey kid likes the bonding hates the food, enjoys learning to prepare food with adult, y\u2019all should try it sometime. Bio mom immediately attacks you with gold digger and insults you. You reply with what was absolutely reasonable as a person, maybe even a chaste reply in your culture (in mine that reply would be a near sainthood reply) but not something a stepmom should allow herself to be pushed to say. Biomom TA hard for attacking you character especially with something not true. \n Idk how people are missing this but, English is not your first language. Do you come from a different culture background than at least bio mom?", "YTA because you ask a legitimate question and then refuse the answer of the overwhelming majority because it\u2019s not what you wanted to hear. They the hell did you even post? You are the problem but you\u2019ll never see it", "You are so the a**hole. How dare you judge the way this woman tries to parent? She is doing her best, and you have no right to interfere and tell her how she should be parenting. Your attitude indicates you have no respect for this poor woman, and your stepdaughter will pick up on that attitude. Behaviour like this can destroy relationships between parents and children, especially in the teenage years. The last thing on the world this family needs is someone enabling the daughter to play parents off against each other. Unless you\u2019re genuinely concerned that the daughter may starve to death without a tasty lunch, shut up and respect her mother\u2019s choices for her children. \nIt must be bloody hard work being so perfect.", "YTA.  You \"suggested she do what we do.\"  Uh huh. And which is it...is it 'do what we do' (which seems to be every day) or is 'once a month just to make her child happy'?", "I probably wouldn\u2019t have called her a shitty mom. I would say that\u2019s not a good thing to do when in a coparent relationship.\n\nBUT. For everything else, no. Yes your stepdaughter likes packed lunches and she enjoys doing it with you. That\u2019s good parental time bonding. You\u2019re also not at fault for how her bio mom reacted. She reacted negatively for something that would benefit her child, and instead lashed out on you. If she\u2019s struggling with her parental load well\u2026that\u2019s her fault. As a single dad who also has primary custody I manage to work full time, go to college, and get schedule and take my kids to every appointment, provide for them, and do whatever I need to do. \n\nWhile you can\u2019t make her mom buy lunch, she also shouldn\u2019t berate you for passing info on and offering a suggestion. She sounds like a bitter BM for that.", "You asked if you was the arse, you was told you was but didn\u2019t like that answer so why bother asking!", "YTA. You don't get to decide how others parent and you're lucky she doesn't kick your a**.", "YTA. You have no business telling her how to parent, and there's nothing wrong with her daughter (not yours) eating school lunch (or at 14 packing her own). You're a parent of a toddler; she works full time and parents multiple kids. You need to understand someone's life before you judge it, and inserting yourself in this situation is not okay regardless", "No partner to share the household work?? How about the kids??\n\nI\u2019m not saying that OP is right, but what kind of household did y\u2019all grow up in where the kids weren\u2019t the ones doing the general housework?? Floors, dishes/kitchen counters, dusting, their own laundry, etc. is usually the teenager\u2019s responsibility, unless of course there was a stay at home mom who did that while the kids were at school. On weekends, we\u2019d all divvy up the big stuff like moving furniture to clean under it, bathrooms, etc.\n\nI grew up in a single parent household, and me and all my friends with single parents all had the same chores. Any time we went over to each others house after school, we helped with the chores so we could get to hang out longer. \n\nOn top of that, I often cooked because I was better at it than my mom lol. My mom would work her 10 hour days plus commute and come home to a clean house and dinner ready. That\u2019s how it should be.", "How is op not on the job 24/7 too? I thought that the emotional labor of raising children was what made the 24/7 on the job statement true about mothers", "Not only are the boys older (which I don't think necessarily means they need more or less care than the 14 year old; from what I've heard from parents with teenage/adult kids it seems to really depend on the kid if the age differences aren't huge) but in OPs edit she says their mom attends events for them but not for the daughter. That to me makes me want to say n t a but there are many better ways OP could have addressed the issue and demanding the bio mom start making lunches does cross a line in my opinion and makes it more ESH", "I had to laugh. Since when did a deadbeat become a requirement to the term single mother. Like you said (and ironically they explained) if someone is a mother and single then by definition they are a single mother.", "sense? dude said that a mother, who is single, is not a single mom because ex has some custody  \nonly sense in that post is nonsense", "Stepmom does not get to dictate how bio mom spends time with her daughter.  She needs to step back and let the mother/daughter navigate their relationship during the bio\u2019s custody time without interference.", "Oh, they are. There usually is some better tasting stuff, but it is a la carte. I mean it is food, but it has the taste and nutritional value of next to nothing. I have to eat gluten free, and my cruddy store bought food often tastes better.", "Teens don't want school lunch because it's not \"cool,\" not because it's gross. OP is clueless and thinks she's better than mom.", "School lunch is expensive. It costs me $6.50 just to buy a burger for my daughter at school!", "Because the world and this sub is full of mediocre parents, it's like a pattern, most of the time the votes come from self projection ignoring the poster's case.\n\nSome others just stick to the narratives in which a single parent can do no wrong and step mothers are bad and vicious \ud83d\ude34\n\nI do think she was harsh with the way she expressed herself but it's true that the bio mom is straining her relationship with her daughter.", "This\u2026.I have a kid the same age and they pack their own lunch everyday. If they don\u2019t park their lunch, they can get school lunch.  If they don\u2019t eat at school, they have food when they get home and they will be hungry, but not starving.\n\nIf I were this girls mom being spoken to by my ex\u2019s SAHW while I worked to support 3 kids, I\u2019d be pissed. Sorry\u2026I don\u2019t have time to custom cook meals for lunch.", "No. You have to spend time with your kids and listen to their problems in order to not be called a shitty mom. It\u2019s really not hard to acknowledge the issue and explain that you simply don\u2019t have time to help pack a lunch.", "You can, and should, speak from experience!\n\nBut personal experience doesn't change the meaning of words. That's what people have been trying to explain.", "Yta, I'm obviously you are, not a big age gap hahah 7 years", "YTA. Not being able to afford lunches doesn't make her a shitty mom. School lunch is free for a reason, and this is it. Stop being such a judgmental asshat and stop purposely coming between your stepdaughter and her mother.", "Not the original commenter but it seemed like they were making a distinction between a parent raising children all on their own vs a parent raising children with shared custody and financial support from someone they are not married to? The latter is still co-parenting even though they are no longer married", "So am I to believe that the only \u201clove language\u201d this girl understands is for her mother to pack her a lunch everyday? Are you for real right now?", "The internet is amazing. This person didn't even vote.", "As a co parentyou have to be neutral.", "Thank you... Exactly this... 14 is more than old enough for someone to start packing their own lunches.", "Sometimes the \u201creal mom\u201d is barely a mother at all. Is being a mother simply providing access to food/water/shelter? She\u2019s asking for the \u201creal mom\u201d to step it up and actually spend quality time with their mutual child.", "Telling someone else how to parent is always an asshole move.", "The word \"household\" is the key here. Did your parents live in the same \"household\" after the divorce or not? If the answer is no, then you grew up with 2 parents that functionally had 2 separate households. Therefore, you had 2 Single-Parent households that you belonged to. \"Head of Household\" when filling taxes refers to the individuals who work to keep the home they live in. While married, your parents were co-heads of that home. Once divorced, they became Single-and-seperate heads of their respective households. They no longer 100% shared the financial burden of raising you. Even if child support is paid, they are now more likely to be individually paying at the very least 80-90% of their own homes. That's what it means to be a Single Mom/Dad/Parent. It has nothing to do with whether or not there is a co-parent involved."]}
