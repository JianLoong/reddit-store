So, of course, I love baking Xmas goodies. Every year I get requests from family members to make specific things they like for our family get-togethers.  I don't always make everything people ask for, but sometimes I get carried away and go a bit overboard.  This year, my husband and I were hosting my family for Xmas day, so I wanted to do a lot of baking on the days leading up to the gathering.\n\nI had Friday off of work so I got a fair amount done, but not as much as I wanted to because our 3 kids were home from school and I kept getting distracted.  So, on Saturday, I told my husband to take the kids out of the house for a few hours so that I could focus on baking.  He really didn't want to do that because it was Xmas Eve and it was cold (we did have a dangerous wind chill warning).  I told him that there was no way I could get all the baking done that I wanted to if he and the kids were in the house so I needed him to take them out to do something, anything, I don't care what.  \n\nHe reluctantly agreed and I was able to get everything done that I wanted to.  After I was done, I was exhausted and laid on the couch for a few minutes to rest before cleaning up the disaster in the kitchen.  I must have fallen asleep because I got woken up by my husband loudly doing the dishes.  \n\nI went to the kitchen and told him that I had planned on cleaning up, but I must have fallen asleep.  I offered to take over for him, but he said he was almost done so there's no point.  I could tell he wasn't happy since he was basically rage-cleaning mixing bowls.  \n\nHe asked if I got all my baking done and I told him that I did and I was really happy with how everything turned out.  He simply replied \"Good\" without even taking his eyes off what he was doing.  I asked him how the outing was with the kids and he just said \"Fine.\"  I knew something was up so I asked him what was wrong.\n\nHe said I kicked him out of the house so that I could do my \"hobby\" on one of the coldest days of the year and then he comes home to a huge mess in the kitchen and me napping on the couch.  I told him I didn't plan on falling asleep and had every intention of cleaning up after myself, but he didn't seem to care.\n\nHe told me that he needs to start dinner because the kids are hungry so he's going to do that as soon as he finishes cleaning up \"your huge mess.\"  I told him I was sorry for falling asleep without cleaning and offered to cook dinner so he can relax, but he told me that he just wants to be left alone for an hour while he cooks.\n\nThis isn't the first time that he's cleaned up after one of my baking marathons.  When he cooks, he does dishes as he goes, but I can't multitask like that.  So I leave the dishes until I'm done.  But sometimes I get distracted with kids or something else and unintentionally leave a mess in the kitchen.  But usually I can get him to at least let me take over for him if he starts cleaning up after me.", "created_utc": 1672177040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwqypc/aita_for_not_cleaning_the_kitchen_after_i_did_a/", "score": 830, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why make it worse ?", "YTA\n\nNot really sure how you \"couldn't possibly\" bake with him and the kids in the house. It was cold and Christmas eve.....

This is about forcing your husband out of the house with zero warning, on Christmas Eve, and on a day with dangerous weather conditions about.

So hundreds and hundreds of cookies. Plus pies, brownies and whatever else got thrown in.\n\nAll of it done with my 4 kids and my sister\u2019s 4 kids \u201chelping\u201d.

You sent your family away on Christmas eve?  Out into the freezing cold (dangerous cold) with no plan....was he supposed to take them to the mall and that craziness?  Just drive around?  What was he supposed to do last minute?    \n\n\nWhy couldn't your kids help you bake?  Why couldn't you have spread it out through the season (our family did a little bit of baking every weekend and then froze the cookies).  Why did they have to leave the house - couldn't you have just asked him to keep them out of the kitchen?  Isn't that part of the Christmas fun?  Baking as a family? Spending Christmas eve as a family?  You threw out your immediate family to bake these goodies to impress your extended family.", "YTA, majorly. Christmas Eve is as big of a holiday as Christmas Day pretty much, and you sent your entire family out of the house into frigid temps on a crazy hectic day/night because you are too lazy to get your shit together in time before the holidays hit.

Why couldn\u2019t he just mind the kids at home while you bake?  Im sure coming home to a disaster in the kitchen and you napping was the icing on the cake.  You laid down on the couch and act shocked that you fell asleep.  You weren\u2019t just taking a break.  You could have done that sitting up.  Edit to add\u2026..you have left the mess before.

This attitude of \u201cI just can\u2019t do it!\u201d Is unacceptable when it has resulted in your husband having to clean up the mess without agreeing to or being asked multiple times. I\u2019m not perfect, the kitchen isn\u2019t sparkling when I\u2019m done. But I manage to keep all the garbage in one bowl, put the dishes away in the sink/dishwasher as I go, etc. that way if I get burned out and need to rest right after, my husband isn\u2019t burdened with the entire bulk of the cleaning. He will just come in behind and pick up the last one or two things I might miss and give an extra wipe down to the areas behind the counter I sometimes miss.

OP, I'm not sure how to say this in a way that doesn't sound hostile, but it's not actually intended to be. I'm trying to save your marriage, here:\n\nYour post makes you sound enormously egoistical. Like, hugely, borderline unbelievably so. You're kicking your family out of the house in terrible weather just so you can enjoy your favourite hobby? Sure, you've \"over-promised\" what you're going to bake, but you like that, don't you? You like doing something that makes other people be grateful towards you, appreciate you, give you attention. So much so that you completely ignore what it's doing to your marriage.\n\nIn your husband's shoes I'd feel disrespected and hurt, because you're basically showing him that your hubby matters less to you than your hobby does.

Your husband has every right to be pissed. You also mentioned this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s had to clean up after you, clearly this is a pattern of yours. Your behavior was selfish and immature. Do better for both your children and husband.", "YTA. You chose to do further baking and in order to do so you chucked your husband and 3 children out when there was a dangerous wind chill warning because you didn't think you could complete what was planned with them present? Really? You could have stuck the children in front of a film or two for a few hours in the nice warm comfortable house instead of putting them at risk in the cold weather. If your husband had stayed, he might even have been happy to wash as you worked. Or your husband could have played games with the kids to keep them distracted. \n\nThen, whilst they were still out of the house, you zonked out on the sofa and napped for how long? Long enough for them to get home and your husband to get through the majority of the washing up it seems. \n\nAs for your comment that you can't multitask and do dishes as you go, if you were doing multiple bakes you could have washed up the dishes from one bake whilst something was in the oven or cooling, rather leave it all piled up until all the bakes were complete. If one dish didn't get done because you didn't have energy or time, your family probably wouldn't even have noticed.", "YTA!

While the eggs, dairy, etc. are coming to room temperature I weigh/measure everything and prepare the baking pans:sheets. That way, while the mixer is running I can rinse dishes and put them in the dishwasher. Whatever doesn\u2019t get rinsed while the batter/dough is mixing get done while the baked goods are in the oven (during which I also clean the counters). \n\nIt is clear that your baking hobby (no quotation marks) creates drudgery for your husband.

Could you be any more oblivious?", "YTA. I have ADHD and struggle with cleaning as I go, but that failing is mine to manage, not my partner's. Banishing your family during a dangerously cold weather event was selfish and stupid. You didn't even come up with an activity--just told them to get lost. You forced your husband to clean your disaster just so he could use the kitchen and feed your children.

Hopefully you learned something from this and don\u2019t pull this shit again", "YTA\n\nFirst lesson of baking is baking creates a huge mess if you don't tidy, soak bowls and utensils, and put back items you no longer need, and leaving that for any other reason than a house fire is obnoxious. \n\nClean as you go and you will only have a few things to clean up after baking.", "YTA for sending your children out in freezing weather so you can cake and for leaving all the cleaning to your husband.", "Yep, YTA!

Just think about what he went through. You asked him to leave so you can focus. Fine I get it. Unfortunately it\u2019s the wrong night to do that.

Bullshit.  He doesn't get to treat you like that.  It's not okay to come in to the house the two of your share and be an asshole because he's frustrated.
