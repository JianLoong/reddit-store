I\u2019ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she\u2019s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn\u2019t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I\u2019m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn\u2019t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea. \n\nThis didn\u2019t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I\u2019m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don\u2019t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days.\n\nShe works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn\u2019t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn\u2019t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I\u2019m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who \u201cwouldn\u2019t leave the kids in pjs all day.\u201d I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m furious. Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1676330429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111naqe/aita_for_not_keeping_up_with_my_wifes_cleaning/", "score": 474, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I may be the asshole for letting my wife do the majority of the housework on top of working a lot with usually only 1 day off. 2.

If I had children, they would likely be stricter since kids touch everything, put stuff in their mouths, roll around on the floor, etc. In my book, I would consider you a slob. \n\nRight now, you're wife is coming home to a place where she doesn't feel comfortable living in. Regardless of how *you* feel about cleanliness, SHE ISN'T COMFORTABLE IN HER OWN HOME. That, in my opinion, supercedes your disagreement about cleanliness standards. Think of how you would feel in her place.\n\nFrom what I'm reading here, you're a SAHD and you're not keeping up your end of the bargain. If you don't think you should clean that often, then she's right - you should go back to work and hire someone to help keep your house clean. \n\nYTA", "YTA. The requests you have listed at the frequencies you have listed are NORMAL. However, with her work schedule and the ages of your two littles, you might need to compromise on someone to come in and do bathrooms, mopping, bed linens, etc weekly to give you both some relief, BUT the rest of the list??? Bathing kids, washing dishes and countertops, you should be handling that with little ones around. Welcome to parenthood.", "YTA. \n\nEvery single \u201ccrazy\u201d clean thing you mentioned except having shoes in the house is a basic expectation I have and I consider myself fairly messy.\n\nNot bathing your kids daily gets me.

Maybe talk to someone and see if you can work through this\n\nETA: YTA", "YTA because of some of the specific things you said. The kids do need to be bathed everyday. Dishes cannot be left for several days. If the kids are playing on the floor, the floor does need to vacuumed and mopped regularly.\n\nI understand it\u2019s very difficult to manage the housework while also being a stay at home parent.

You\u2019re just a slob.", "Yta please take care of your children and home like an adult", "YTA. I thought she was going to turn out to be a crazy person who wanted to clean the tile grout with a toothbrush twice a week and be able to eat off the floors at a moment\u2019s notice. Doing dishes daily, cleaning the bathrooms weekly and not wearing shoes in the house are perfectly normal standards. Yours haven\u2019t achieved dangerously disgusting, but they are on the slobber, yuckier end of the normal spectrum. I usually think couples with differing standards need to find some reasonable compromise, but you lose points with me for not even trying and for painting your wife as someone whose standards are extreme.", "YTA\n\nJust one example (edit: of many) of the above: Dirty dishes left in the sink for a few days can attract ants, mice, etc. Go back to work and hire a nanny. Save your marriage.", "Instead of comparing her expectations/cleanliness to yourself, you should take a look at hers and your definitions of cleanliness with an average household.\n\nYou had some points regarding your wife that could be considered a bit \"excessive\", but realistically, you have a lot more going against you than going against your wife.  Not bathing your kids for 1-3 days?  These are the same kids that are still shitting their pants every other hour and you want to go that long in between bathing them?  GAWT DAMN.", "Yes YTA. Your wife's expectations are normal.", "Yes, YTA. Your wife's expectations are not unrealistic. She simply doesn't want to live in a sty. You can't do dishes daily? How do you live like that? You can't run a vacuum over the house once a week? You can't mop once a week? You can't change the bedding once a week? What, pray tell, do you do all day? And, yes, if you're the stay at home parent, you're principally responsible for the upkeep of the house. Do better.", "This is clearly bait. No one is this utterly clueless.", "YTA. It's perfectly reasonable to want a clean home and want the kids to be clean. If it wasn't for my physical health being what it is right now, I would be wanting our tiny 1 bedroom apartment as clean as she wants her home because I was raised to keep things clean and not have people thinking we live in a barn. But since my physical health has gotten as bad as it has, it's a struggle for me but I do stress about it all the time which doesn't help with my mental health. I don't understand why you want to be lazy and not keep things clean. You do know that leaving food out attracts knats and all kinds of bugs including roaches right? I don't think you want bugs in a home around children. That's not a healthy living environment for them. Either start keeping things clean since you aren't working outside of the home or go back to work and hire someone to come in and clean and/or baby sit. Or if she wants she can stay home with the kids and clean the home. It's a simple and reasonable ask. That's part of the job requirement being a stay at home spouse. You can't expect her to go to work and come home and clean up everything too.", "Yta those sound like *normal* standards.  Vacuuming once a week, bedding washed once a week, mop a couple times a week is all standard.", "YTA you want to mop every 2 weeks? Yuck. Your wife's expected cleaning schedule is pretty normal.", "YTA. You\u2019re not working with her in this situation because you simply do not want to do it. If stay at home mums can do it so can you.

Just get with the program and get it done!", "Her requests are mostly reasonable and she's correct, you should go back to work and get a nanny and a housekeeper. YTA.

If the kids are in pj's all day, then you're not taking them out for adventures at the park, museum or library. Do you read to them all day? What?\n\nYour wife's cleanliness goals are pretty much bog standard. Dishes washed every day? Check. Sheets changed once a week? Check. Bathrooms cleaned weekly? Check.

I\u2019d lean more towards NAH if her standards of cleanliness were more extreme.\n\nHer cleanliness doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable, with a few exceptions. Doing the dishes every day is easier. Sheets should be cleaned weekly. It\u2019s ok to mess up sometimes, but in general it\u2019s better to force yourself to do it daily. That being said, a third party could maybe help you compromise on some things, but overall you should be trying to do the same amount of housework a standard household would be doing.", "Your wife's \"crazy cleaning\" seems normal to me. Everything you have listed is a normal list of cleaning in most households. I even do more than that , but that's my individual preference. She isn't out of line for wanting these things done. You're a stay at home dad. Your job is to take care of the babies and keep your home clean. SAHM do these things. So you should too. She isn't being unreasonable at all.

I'm single and I don't even live like you do.\n\nRun the dishwasher every night.  Leaving dishes in the sink attracts pests.\n\nBathrooms should be cleaned weekly.  They are a huge source of germs.  If you have a son, you will soon learn this lesson...right around the time he starts potty training.  He will miss the target and pee on the floor.  Your wife will scrub it up each time.  You will allow the yellow puddle to dry and cake on.\n\nI'll give you the shoes in the house.  I'm okay with that.  If you come in hot and sweaty, head straight for the shower before you even sit on the furniture, much less stretch out on the bed.  My father walks in the front door, announces \"I'm taking a shower, I'll be back\" and heads down the hall to the bathroom.\n\nEver hear of dermatitis neglecta?  It's caused by a buildup of dead skin cells, oils, and other materials on the skin.  It can cause scaly, itchy patches.  When someone scratches those patches, they become subject to secondary infections.  Also, please note that the condition is caused by neglect...which can result in CPS involvement to make sure your children are not being neglected.  Personal hygiene will be hugely important to your kids when they are older.  You are not giving them a good foundation now.\n\nI could be a little forgiving on the toy issue, but not on the vacuuming/mopping issue.  Look at the bottom of your shoes.  Ask yourself if you've ever stepped in dog poo in those shoes.  Even if you scraped it off before coming in, you've still brought those germs in on the floor.  Your kids crawl around on that floor.  They pick stuff up off that floor and stick it in their mouths.\n\nYou are doing a poor job.  She ends up doing everything on her day off because you don't do anything.  I'm amazed she put up with you for this long.  Your wife is right.  You are wrong.  If she leaves you and provided a copy of this post to her divorce attorney, you will probably only get supervised visitation or you may be required to be monitored by CPS to make sure you are not neglecting your kids and that you are keeping your home clean enough for them to be there with you.", "YTA your wife has normal expectations.

You're unlikely to find another partner who will match your cleaning style so I'd take the lifeline she just threw - go back to work and hire a nanny and housekeeper so you don't end up divorced.

While you do not have an easy job, you still have a job and you need to treat it like a job. Your wife's cleaning standard's are by no means crazy, even with 2 toddlers. She works 40-80 hours a week and unfortunately you need to as well. A big part of that is childcare, but even that should leave you at least several hours a day for housework. Perhaps some chores won't be able to be done every single day. Picking up kids toys every day is to some extent sisyphean, but you need to make some effort. My suggestion would be to time your work during a week. if you really are working full time while your wife is gone on childcare and chores (excepting maybe 1 hour for bathroom breaks and lunch) and you can't complete what she is asking for then you may have some grounds for talking with her about where to compromise. But remember, this is full time work, not sitting on your phone or watching tv or browsing reddit. \n\nOne suggestion for some chores is a robotic vacuum/mop.

In your case, you aren\u2019t doing even the minimum for your kids (getting them dressed) or your home (doing dishes daily).

I\u2019ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she\u2019s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn\u2019t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I\u2019m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn\u2019t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea. \n\nThis didn\u2019t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I\u2019m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don\u2019t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days.\n\nShe works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn\u2019t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn\u2019t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I\u2019m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who \u201cwouldn\u2019t leave the kids in pjs all day.\u201d I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m furious. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Daily baths? Weekly bedding changes? Weekly bathroom cleanings?? Bro I live alone and I do that.  I don\u2019t shower every night before bed but I\u2019d easily make that accommodation if my partner requested it.   \n\n3) your wife is clearly showing you what hills she is choosing to die on and frankly fam they are pretty fucking tiny ones.   The fact that both of you are willing to let this escalate to the point where *god damn bags are being packed* shows how little you respect her wishes and how absolutely fucking *done* with you she is. I\u2019m still struggling to see what the super-hard part is. Kids should be cleaned daily because they are fucking disease vectors who are enamored with the taste of their own snot and the floor should be cleaned very often because they will literally lick it with only the slightest provocation. \nToys should be put away daily because if not they pile up and add clutter, also how are you supposed to properly clean with stuff strewn all over the place? \nDishes *should* be washed daily but I don\u2019t always though I try. Dishes in a house of FOUR should absolutely be washed every day, it should be an after-dinner ritual. \n\nNothing that she is asking seems wild to me and again let me stress I\u2019m a man who lives alone. These are just things you do and while it\u2019s understandable for things to not always be perfect or to sometimes have a conversation about them I feel like you have a radically different idea of what a \u201cclean house\u201d should be.  For the sake of everyone you should either a) follow her very basic requests. B) get a job and a house keeper, also have fun paying for the babysitter too. C) divorce and move into your own personal sarlac pit where as long as nothing is breeding under the pile of empty cans in the corner the house is \u201cclean\u201d. \n\nYTA", "YTA majorly.

Monthly is cleaning the fridge, laundering curtains, wiping baseboards, but it\u2019s done on a different day of the month. DO NOT DISCUSS THIS WITH YOUR WIFE. She\u2019s made it clear what her expectations are. We\u2019re all telling you there normal.

It's already much better for my mental health.\n\nDishes need to be done daily, so does laundry, sweeping and vaccuming. Bathrooms needs to be done once a week for sure.

Weekly tasks can be stretched out if a person doesn't have the time (and it sounds like you do have the time). Be better, because at the moment you're not pulling your own weight.

Our house is often a nightmare because he thinks just watching the kids and cooking every other day is enough where I feel he should be cleaning some because it's hard for me to keep up with even the bare minimum.\n\nAnyway, this went on for almost 5 years until he finally agreed to go back to work. We were miserable during that time. Depressed, burned out, resentful. We were resentful of each other, feeling the other wasn't doing enough. Now days, yes I do more than him, but at least he's bringing money, kids are in daycare so there's not as much mess and I don't have  that weight of financial strain on top of a disgusting house.\n\nSo yeah, just go back to work.

Doesn't really sound like much caretaking to me.", "When my kids were 1 and 3,I had a schedule, you have to keep on top of it. Kids can be watched while you're doing stuff,he doesn't even bath them.

Bathrooms get a weekly deep clean. Toilets cleaned every few days. Bedding washed weekly. Toys picked up 85% because at some point I tire of hunting down all the little ones my kids have. Dishes done daily. If they are in the sink, they are in the clean side to dry like my hand wash only items.\nBut really, this is normal. This is managing a house.

And then do a deep mop once a week.", "Oh I see.  I cut that way down by having the water sanitizers in each tank.  So each flush the toilet bowl is being cleaned.  Then for actual cleaning, I spray the lysol on the seat and the rim, use the gel to get under the rim.  Give the bowl a good scrub.  Wipe the seat off and then the rim and back of the toilet.
