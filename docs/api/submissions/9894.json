I\u2019ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she\u2019s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn\u2019t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I\u2019m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn\u2019t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea. \n\nThis didn\u2019t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I\u2019m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don\u2019t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days.\n\nShe works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn\u2019t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn\u2019t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I\u2019m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who \u201cwouldn\u2019t leave the kids in pjs all day.\u201d I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m furious.

I may be the asshole for letting my wife do the majority of the housework on top of working a lot with usually only 1 day off. 2.

If I had children, they would likely be stricter since kids touch everything, put stuff in their mouths, roll around on the floor, etc. In my book, I would consider you a slob. \n\nRight now, you're wife is coming home to a place where she doesn't feel comfortable living in. Regardless of how *you* feel about cleanliness, SHE ISN'T COMFORTABLE IN HER OWN HOME. That, in my opinion, supercedes your disagreement about cleanliness standards. Think of how you would feel in her place.\n\nFrom what I'm reading here, you're a SAHD and you're not keeping up your end of the bargain. If you don't think you should clean that often, then she's right - you should go back to work and hire someone to help keep your house clean. \n\nYTA", "YTA. The requests you have listed at the frequencies you have listed are NORMAL. However, with her work schedule and the ages of your two littles, you might need to compromise on someone to come in and do bathrooms, mopping, bed linens, etc weekly to give you both some relief, BUT the rest of the list??? Bathing kids, washing dishes and countertops, you should be handling that with little ones around. Welcome to parenthood.", "YTA. \n\nEvery single \u201ccrazy\u201d clean thing you mentioned except having shoes in the house is a basic expectation I have and I consider myself fairly messy.\n\nNot bathing your kids daily gets me.

Not cleaning your kids is seeing them up for bullying and health problems.\n\nAnd leaving the dishes for a couple of days in the sink is disgusting.

Maybe talk to someone and see if you can work through this\n\nETA: YTA", "YTA because of some of the specific things you said. The kids do need to be bathed everyday. Dishes cannot be left for several days. If the kids are playing on the floor, the floor does need to vacuumed and mopped regularly.\n\nI understand it\u2019s very difficult to manage the housework while also being a stay at home parent.

You\u2019re just a slob.", "Yta please take care of your children and home like an adult", "YTA. I thought she was going to turn out to be a crazy person who wanted to clean the tile grout with a toothbrush twice a week and be able to eat off the floors at a moment\u2019s notice. Doing dishes daily, cleaning the bathrooms weekly and not wearing shoes in the house are perfectly normal standards. Yours haven\u2019t achieved dangerously disgusting, but they are on the slobber, yuckier end of the normal spectrum. I usually think couples with differing standards need to find some reasonable compromise, but you lose points with me for not even trying and for painting your wife as someone whose standards are extreme.", "YTA\n\nJust one example (edit: of many) of the above: Dirty dishes left in the sink for a few days can attract ants, mice, etc. Go back to work and hire a nanny.

Not bathing your kids for 1-3 days?  These are the same kids that are still shitting their pants every other hour and you want to go that long in between bathing them?  GAWT DAMN.", "Yes YTA. Your wife's expectations are normal.", "Yes, YTA. Your wife's expectations are not unrealistic. She simply doesn't want to live in a sty. You can't do dishes daily? How do you live like that? You can't run a vacuum over the house once a week? You can't mop once a week? You can't change the bedding once a week? What, pray tell, do you do all day? And, yes, if you're the stay at home parent, you're principally responsible for the upkeep of the house. Do better.", "This is clearly bait. No one is this utterly clueless.", "YTA. It's perfectly reasonable to want a clean home and want the kids to be clean. If it wasn't for my physical health being what it is right now, I would be wanting our tiny 1 bedroom apartment as clean as she wants her home because I was raised to keep things clean and not have people thinking we live in a barn. But since my physical health has gotten as bad as it has, it's a struggle for me but I do stress about it all the time which doesn't help with my mental health. I don't understand why you want to be lazy and not keep things clean. You do know that leaving food out attracts knats and all kinds of bugs including roaches right? I don't think you want bugs in a home around children. That's not a healthy living environment for them. Either start keeping things clean since you aren't working outside of the home or go back to work and hire someone to come in and clean and/or baby sit. Or if she wants she can stay home with the kids and clean the home. It's a simple and reasonable ask. That's part of the job requirement being a stay at home spouse. You can't expect her to go to work and come home and clean up everything too.", "Yta those sound like *normal* standards.  Vacuuming once a week, bedding washed once a week, mop a couple times a week is all standard.", "YTA you want to mop every 2 weeks? Yuck. Your wife's expected cleaning schedule is pretty normal.", "YTA. You\u2019re not working with her in this situation because you simply do not want to do it. If stay at home mums can do it so can you.

Just get with the program and get it done!", "Her requests are mostly reasonable and she's correct, you should go back to work and get a nanny and a housekeeper. YTA.

If the kids are in pj's all day, then you're not taking them out for adventures at the park, museum or library. Do you read to them all day? What?\n\nYour wife's cleanliness goals are pretty much bog standard. Dishes washed every day? Check. Sheets changed once a week? Check. Bathrooms cleaned weekly? Check.

I\u2019d lean more towards NAH if her standards of cleanliness were more extreme.\n\nHer cleanliness doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable, with a few exceptions. Doing the dishes every day is easier. Sheets should be cleaned weekly. It\u2019s ok to mess up sometimes, but in general it\u2019s better to force yourself to do it daily. That being said, a third party could maybe help you compromise on some things, but overall you should be trying to do the same amount of housework a standard household would be doing.", "Your wife's \"crazy cleaning\" seems normal to me. Everything you have listed is a normal list of cleaning in most households. I even do more than that , but that's my individual preference. She isn't out of line for wanting these things done. You're a stay at home dad. Your job is to take care of the babies and keep your home clean. SAHM do these things. So you should too. She isn't being unreasonable at all.

I'm single and I don't even live like you do.\n\nRun the dishwasher every night.  Leaving dishes in the sink attracts pests.\n\nBathrooms should be cleaned weekly.  They are a huge source of germs.  If you have a son, you will soon learn this lesson...right around the time he starts potty training.  He will miss the target and pee on the floor.  Your wife will scrub it up each time.  You will allow the yellow puddle to dry and cake on.\n\nI'll give you the shoes in the house.  I'm okay with that.  If you come in hot and sweaty, head straight for the shower before you even sit on the furniture, much less stretch out on the bed.  My father walks in the front door, announces \"I'm taking a shower, I'll be back\" and heads down the hall to the bathroom.\n\nEver hear of dermatitis neglecta?  It's caused by a buildup of dead skin cells, oils, and other materials on the skin.  It can cause scaly, itchy patches.  When someone scratches those patches, they become subject to secondary infections.  Also, please note that the condition is caused by neglect...which can result in CPS involvement to make sure your children are not being neglected.  Personal hygiene will be hugely important to your kids when they are older.  You are not giving them a good foundation now.\n\nI could be a little forgiving on the toy issue, but not on the vacuuming/mopping issue.  Look at the bottom of your shoes.  Ask yourself if you've ever stepped in dog poo in those shoes.  Even if you scraped it off before coming in, you've still brought those germs in on the floor.  Your kids crawl around on that floor.  They pick stuff up off that floor and stick it in their mouths.\n\nYou are doing a poor job.  She ends up doing everything on her day off because you don't do anything.  I'm amazed she put up with you for this long.  Your wife is right.  You are wrong.  If she leaves you and provided a copy of this post to her divorce attorney, you will probably only get supervised visitation or you may be required to be monitored by CPS to make sure you are not neglecting your kids and that you are keeping your home clean enough for them to be there with you.", "YTA your wife has normal expectations.

You're unlikely to find another partner who will match your cleaning style so I'd take the lifeline she just threw - go back to work and hire a nanny and housekeeper so you don't end up divorced.

While you do not have an easy job, you still have a job and you need to treat it like a job. Your wife's cleaning standard's are by no means crazy, even with 2 toddlers. She works 40-80 hours a week and unfortunately you need to as well. A big part of that is childcare, but even that should leave you at least several hours a day for housework. Perhaps some chores won't be able to be done every single day. Picking up kids toys every day is to some extent sisyphean, but you need to make some effort. My suggestion would be to time your work during a week. if you really are working full time while your wife is gone on childcare and chores (excepting maybe 1 hour for bathroom breaks and lunch) and you can't complete what she is asking for then you may have some grounds for talking with her about where to compromise. But remember, this is full time work, not sitting on your phone or watching tv or browsing reddit. \n\nOne suggestion for some chores is a robotic vacuum/mop.

In your case, you aren\u2019t doing even the minimum for your kids (getting them dressed) or your home (doing dishes daily).

I\u2019ll provide context. I married my wife 3 years ago but we have been together 6. One important thing to note is she\u2019s extremely clean. I regret not moving in together until we married because while I knew she was clean I didn\u2019t know the full extent. Let this be a lesson to live with your partner before marriage. She is the reason why our house looks like a model home. She hates dishes in the sink while I\u2019m content to let them sit for a couple days. She spends her off days scrubbing bathrooms because in her mind they should be cleaned weekly. She doesn\u2019t let me bring my shoes inside and insists I shower immediately when I get home before laying in bed. There are a million more things but hopefully you have an idea. \n\nThis didn\u2019t start hurting our marriage until we had kids. We have a 2 year old and a 1 year old. I\u2019m a SAHD. I left work when our youngest was born and that is when our disagreement on how clean the home needs to be started to get bad. She expects me to do most of the chores now when it used to be primarily her and I wouldn\u2019t mind if they were reasonable. She wants the children to have a bath everyday and I think every 1-3 days is fine. She wants all of their toys put away by the end of the day and I think there is no point when it will be a mess again. She wants the dishes done daily. She wants all house bedding washed weekly. She wants me to vacuum weekly. She wants me to mop every 3-4 days since in her logic the kids spend a lot of time playing on the floor. They will not be hurt or sick if I mop every 2 weeks. Because I don\u2019t play along with most of her demands she ends up being the one to do most of the housework when she gets home or her rare off days.\n\nShe works 40-80 hours/week so it is a lot but she does it to herself. I feel I do what is reasonable. This all built up to today. She got home and saw I hadn\u2019t yet washed the dishes and there was still grease/food in some of the pans and on the countertop. Also I hadn\u2019t yet brought in the trash cans from the previous two days when they were emptied. She flew off the handle calling me lazy and a slob. She said she would like for me to return to work since in her eyes I\u2019m doing a poor job and use the money to hire a weekly housekeeper and a nanny who \u201cwouldn\u2019t leave the kids in pjs all day.\u201d I got pissed and told her she is crazy and she works herself up over small things and I will not be leaving my kids with a stranger. She packed a bag for herself and our babies and to her mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m furious. Am I the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My guy, your wife has very normal cleaning policies. We vacuum and mop our house multiple times per week and change our bedding *at least* once a week.

My husband has insanely high standards for the house (even beyond your wife\u2019s) and I\u2019m a SAHM. The transition was roooough. That being said? I communicated with my partner throughout everything and let him know when I was overwhelmed with the learning curve so he could help (I also have health issues so that played an obvious role). BUT it\u2019s your job to maintain the home and your level of uncleanliness is clearly the one that\u2019s beyond reasonable.

Infants in diapers and toddlers with poor wiping skills need their private parts washed daily.  Especially little girls who can develop yeast infections and urinary tract infections.", "Tbf that\u2019s the one thing I think is pretty normal. Most kids I know wash every other day or even every couple of days, unless they get mucky doing an activity etc. Everything else is batshit gross though, dishes do need to be washed every day!", "That\u2019s extremely normal. Especially babies shouldn\u2019t be bathed every day bc it\u2019s not good for their skin and can dry them out.", "Or bring in the trash cans sitting empty and collected for two days.  Is he just playing video games? The kids don't even get out of pajamas.  A nanny would take them to the park. A housekeeper would do everything. Go 2 work my guy.  Pay for that since u don't want to do it.  Did u see his marriage only started to suffer when she stopped doing all the cleaning on her own? I feel bad for this woman.", "But but but.

But yes, you may have a point there!", "That\u2019s the only one of the things you listed that I would classify as somewhat over the top. I would go so far as to call it a quirk but it\u2019s not like\u2026 insane. Honestly I would love it if no outside clothes or unwashed bodies every touched the bed, I just don\u2019t have the energy to make it happen!\n\nThe other stuff is just\u2026 the ideal standard for a clean home and children. I\u2019m not a terribly neat person and I struggle with housework. I often leave dishes in the sink for a day or two. But I\u2019m not like\u2026 proud of that! I don\u2019t have the balls to pretend that someone who thinks the dishes shouldn\u2019t be left in the sink is WRONG. They are right! I just am bad at meeting that standard.", "I'm gonna be honest, that rule is standard for people I know. If you're outside and have interactions then you shower before getting into bed etc. Honestly for the people I know with  allergies it's if you go outside at all you shower before.", "Maybe related to the pandemic? Or maybe a quirk. I have OCD and nothing she's asking otherwise stands out to me as off the wall. I'm not sure it matters if you are TA or not in the long run, you can't decide to stay a SAHP if your spouse no longer supports you doing that. Can you all afford a weekly housekeeper? Can you meet her halfway and do the dishes every day but have the housekeeper handle mopping/bathrooms once a week? That's probably a $300 to $400/month expense. \n\nI sympathize with you and agree people should live together before marriage but if she's working so much and then having to do so many chores, she's not going to want to continue this. I understand you don't want your kids with a stranger but she doesn't want your kids on dirty floors. These are both fair things to discuss. I think she's probably tired.", "No asshole, she doesn\u2019t want to do things in her time\u2014she just doesn\u2019t want to live in filth, and the little free time she has is spent cleaning up after you.", "\u201cIn her time.\u201d\n\nOk, nope. As a fellow working mum here\u2019s a tip:\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cin her time\u201d, it\u2019s \u201cin time to maintain a smooth household.\u201d\n\nMy husband thought I was being \u201cunreasonable\u201d because he wanted to do his chores at 11pm, until I pointed out that until the kitchen is cleaned after dinner, I can\u2019t prep bottles and lunches, so when you leave it until you can be arsed you give her two options:\n1. Stay up unseasonably late nagging you until you do the basic bloody chore; or\n2. Do it herself, bearing an unfair burden of the household work.\n\nNothing she has asked is unusual or unreasonable.", "Check the relationship subs for multiple posts made my women who have husbands who do nothing in regards to the household.", "Good for you.", "The way he turns things on her is kinda horrifying.", "Well I 100% missed that comment. \n\nParenting and chores need tk be shared. \n\nBut she shouldn\u2019t be doing all the chores and working. \n\nI mean I do understand some people are control freaks. \n\nBut dishes over night and not vacuuming / mopping for two weeks with teeny tiny crawly kids is super unhygienic. I\u2019ll change my rating", "Because I didn't see the comment saying she did most the chores. It wasn't in the original post, and I can't figure out the formatting to strikethrough.\n\nAnd I agree with all your points if she is doing most the work which she is. I agree none of what is above is ideal - as I said in my comment - but would be understandable if he was at home alone with two young kids all day and no support on chores. Which isn't the case, but I didn't see that until someone pointed me to their comment.", "Thanks! The one time I don't check the comments...", "I agree that most of her cleaning schedule is relatively normal (mopping multiple times a week is not tbh).  \n\nWhat is not normal is expecting the partner staying home with small kids do ALL the cleaning before you get home.

That's workaholism.", "I mean yes ideally, but this one seems more parenting style than right or wrong (like leaving dishes in the sink for days). I know families who are super structured and routine oriented with schedules and daily baths/always getting dressed. And I know families that just sort of go with the flow, some days are pjs days, whatever happens happens. The kids are all generally fine either way, except in the cases where a child who PARTICULARLY needs structure is getting none.", "I don\u2019t think vacuuming every other day is excessive and my house is generally a disaster at the best of times. But we have pets and every day vacuum of at least the living room is the minimum to be not entirely gross.", "The cleaning schedule videos are extremely helpful! OP unless you live a huge house with a dozen rooms, cleaning 1-2 rooms a day during the week, is more than manageable and feels great! I wasn\u2019t the most tidy person, but creating a schedule helped immeasurably, and really makes me love my home. \n\nYTA though, for wanting to do everything at your own pace, when your wife\u2019s mental health and your kids\u2019 physical health is at stake. Your wife gets more stressed out because she knows she cannot trust you to do the minimum, and your kids are picking up dirt and dust, affecting their respiratory system, not to mention the skin issues, if you don\u2019t change their bedding every week.", "That\u2019s why I had  holdup moment.

I mean I know she works 40-80s a week, am I the asshole for making her do all the chores?
