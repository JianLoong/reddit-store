In fourth grade (9 years old) she had a bully Emily. She would make fun of Sam's clothes and spread some rumors, this was fourth grade so some of their classmates didn't want to interact with her. Anyways we got to the bottom of it and Emily got in trouble for bullying. This went on for a few weeks, the start of the school year, and was shut down quickly. The school did the right steps and Emily left her alone. Emily had to give an apology also and two weeks of detention.\n\nAfter that, they didn't interact much but Emily was civil, in sixth grade she gave another apology in the form of a letter. She started being friendly to Emily but they never formed a friendship. She really grew out of being a bully and overall decent person. She went on to be one of the popular kids in school and I never heard of a problem with her since. Only good things since.\n\nNow they are both in Senior year of high school, Sam's cousin started to date Emily in Junior year. We are hosting an Easter hunt at the house this weekend, its a general rule that the family can bring extra people. Sam's cousin is bringing Emily, I learned this today. Sam was pissed and told me to ban her from coming. I told her no and an argument broke out. She doesn't want her bully at the event and I told her this happened when she was 9 and that she needs to get over it. My other daughter is on her side but the rest of the family really thinks its time to move past this, it's been ten years and Emily has been nothing but nice since.\n\nEdit: she is not being bullied, I know this 100%. Emily has been nothing but civil or nice to her since the punishment in fourth grade when she was 9.\n\nSince people are asking for examples about the bullying.  (from a comment I answered)\n\nEmily never did anything physical, sexual or racial. She made fun of her  clothes. Sam really liked bright neon clothes at the time. She got called a traffic cone when she would wear orange for example.\n\nThe rumors were she was colorblind since of what she wore. She's not color blind, just liked bright clothing that didn't match\n\nEdit: Looking at all the responses, I will ask the cousin to not bring Emily.\n\nWell did that, I'm not hosting the event anymore, cousin and sam got in an argument after I asked. It was not good. Cousins brought up all the crap she did when they were kids, she was a big prankster as a kid. He told her that well I don't forgive all your crap either. No one is gonna show up to the event at my house, its happening at my sister everyone is invited but Sam.\n\nThe family has exploded, I'm getting off this site, I should not have come to this subreddit\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1680814413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dxmus/aita_for_not_banning_my_daughters_bully_from_a/", "score": 898, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can forgive someone for what they did to you without ever feeling the need to interact with them again. Sam is going to be an adult soon. So if Emily  does become a member of the family  your daughter can decide whether or not she wants to attend family events if Emily is there. The big difference in that scenario is your daughter while have a choice.  She can decide to attend for awhile and leave if she feels like she can no longer be around Emily.  She can't in this situation because Emily will be in her home.

It is not Sam's home - her safe space - that Emily will be entering.

This is a hard one. You don\u2019t want your nephew to think he disapproves of his new girlfriend and things could get serious. But I get where the daughter is coming from too. And it\u2019s definitely a possible violation to have people you don\u2019t want at a family function. I do think it matters that apparently Emily did this when she was much younger, has apologized twice (at least once apparently sincerely and without being forced to do so), and has apparently grown and matured a great deal since then. I would probably defer to my child on general principle, but I would worry about the character of someone who is almost an adult and cannot let go of childhood squabbles when the person has apologized and since outgrown the behavior. Being unable to let go of minor things isn\u2019t going to serve someone well in life. Some grudges are worth holding onto, including some forms of childhood mistreatment from peers and adults. Maybe the bullying was actually more serious than the mother realizes. Such things frequently are. But it is also the case that some people are capable of holding onto petty grievances for a long time in a way that is detrimental to everyone involved. I would honestly sit down and try to have a serious talk with my daughter to really understand what she is feeling and why before I took any further action. I\u2019d listen a lot and also talk to her about the position I found myself in, wanting to be kind and accepting of the cousin and his new significant other. One thing that did jump out at me is that the mother seems confident that she knows the whole story, whereas there may be things her daughter knows about Emily she hasn\u2019t shared with her mother and that her mother hasn\u2019t taken seriously. I would also talk to the other daughter about things. Since she is taking her sister\u2019s side, she also may have more information about Emily than the mother has. My first priority would be making sure that, if I was the mother, there wasn\u2019t really more that was going on with Emily that I was either unaware of or sweeping under the rug. Some of this also relates to the kind of person the daughter is and since I don\u2019t know her, I can\u2019t speak to that. But here are some questions worth asking yourself about her: Is your daughter generally the type of person that holds on to grudges and petty slights to an extreme degree or is she generally a pretty forgiving person? If the daughter is generally a pretty forgiving person, I\u2019d think it\u2019s likely that there is more to the Emily saga than meets the mother\u2019s eye. If the daughter has a more general problem with holding onto petty grudges well into adulthood for things someone did as a young child they have since sincerely apologized for and ceased doing, I think it could send the wrong signal to the cousin and Emily to blackball Emily. You don\u2019t want to encourage or condone bullying or make your home an unsafe space for your child. You also don\u2019t want to encourage your child to grow into an adult that can\u2019t let go of things and who is too fragile to interact in a mature way with someone that at least right now means a lot to her cousin and also may in the future. One more thing: the cousin may not date Emily for much longer but they\u2019re pretty old and it\u2019s not exactly rare for those relationships to last. So by blackballing Emily, are you potentially going to create issues with the cousin and someone that may be in his life for the foreseeable future? What if they wind up getting married? It may not be wrong to say to Emily, after really listening to her and her sister and treating all of this as if you have a lot more to learn, that now that Emily is in her cousin\u2019s life in a special way, she owes it to her cousin to put this behind her and learn to treat Emily civilly. I can just see this as a backstory ten years down the road for one of those posts in this forum regarding people who get off to a bad start with in-laws and relatives and the relationships never really recover. And there is something to be said for forgiveness in cases where a.) the misconduct is not life ruining, b.) the person who commits the offense sincerely apologizes, c.) the offender is held appropriately accountable, and d.) the person goes for a significant period of time without reengaging in the behavior. I would want to more damn sure that condition d.) has actually been met, but it appears that if there were ever a case to be made for forgiving and forgetting then this sounds to me like this is probably it and sometimes we don\u2019t serve people when we pander to their pettiness. Is that what is going on here? I don\u2019t know. But I don\u2019t think this is a clear cut case. To put my cards on the table, I\u2019m about as radical and hardcore of a youth liberationist as they come and 99% of the time in this forum, I\u2019ll take the side of children over their parents.

No responses to any of my texts and unfriended on social media. I later heard that another kid had started a rumor that I was gay. I never got any confirmation of this, but I never had any other reason given either. When I lost my best friend, I also lost all those other friends (who obviously werent really friends). I didnt get bullied, but I was pretty lonely until I found a new group of friends. For years, I held a lot of resentment towards my friend - much more than I had for the rumor-starter. My point is that the social dynamics of Sam's school are unknowable to her father. Sam may have had a poor experience at school and blames it on Emily.

She fought to change the district's mentality for years before eventually moving on the become a psychologist.

Anti-bullying posters all over the school, yet I had to take a bullying issue all the way to the Superintendent and Board of Trustees to get any actual action. And we're in one of the best schools in the district.\n\nSo, depends on where you live I suppose \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nBut it still doesn't make sense that she would apologize 2 years later if the only thing the bully did was call her colorblind. There has to be more to the story.", "Well look how that turned out lmao", "You're not allowed to keep kids after school here so it's literally just you don't get your free lunch period.", "Hi Zepzoep. I\u2019m curious\u2026 we\u2019re you working at a middle school (grades 6-8) when you saw kids in detention doing cleaning as a punishment? I\u2019ve seen that at middle schools. It\u2019s the weirdest thing because I\u2019ve had students do cleaning as a reward in a few cases. My population is strange though (kids with OCD like cleaning).   \n\nWhy would anyone use cleaning as a punishment?", "You in fact can harbor hatred for a person who has \u201cmade amends\u201d forgiveness is not an entitlement. Doing wrong to another person does not come with a guarantee of redemption.\n\nA wrong is real and permanent, it exists in the moment forever (unless you can get in a Time Machine and go back)\n\nIf you are lucky and your victim chooses to be generous maybe you can be forgiven, but no one is entitled to forgiveness by their victim.\n\nAlso the victim gets to choose for themselves how severe the experience is, no one gets to dictate that.

It was cringe city.
