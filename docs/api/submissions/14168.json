In fourth grade (9 years old) she had a bully Emily. She would make fun of Sam's clothes and spread some rumors, this was fourth grade so some of their classmates didn't want to interact with her. Anyways we got to the bottom of it and Emily got in trouble for bullying. This went on for a few weeks, the start of the school year, and was shut down quickly. The school did the right steps and Emily left her alone. Emily had to give an apology also and two weeks of detention.\n\nAfter that, they didn't interact much but Emily was civil, in sixth grade she gave another apology in the form of a letter. She started being friendly to Emily but they never formed a friendship. She really grew out of being a bully and overall decent person. She went on to be one of the popular kids in school and I never heard of a problem with her since. Only good things since.\n\nNow they are both in Senior year of high school, Sam's cousin started to date Emily in Junior year. We are hosting an Easter hunt at the house this weekend, its a general rule that the family can bring extra people. Sam's cousin is bringing Emily, I learned this today. Sam was pissed and told me to ban her from coming. I told her no and an argument broke out. She doesn't want her bully at the event and I told her this happened when she was 9 and that she needs to get over it. My other daughter is on her side but the rest of the family really thinks its time to move past this, it's been ten years and Emily has been nothing but nice since.\n\nEdit: she is not being bullied, I know this 100%. Emily has been nothing but civil or nice to her since the punishment in fourth grade when she was 9.\n\nSince people are asking for examples about the bullying.  (from a comment I answered)\n\nEmily never did anything physical, sexual or racial. She made fun of her  clothes. Sam really liked bright neon clothes at the time. She got called a traffic cone when she would wear orange for example.\n\nThe rumors were she was colorblind since of what she wore. She's not color blind, just liked bright clothing that didn't match\n\nEdit: Looking at all the responses, I will ask the cousin to not bring Emily.\n\nAITA", "created_utc": 1680814413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12dxmus/aita_for_not_banning_my_daughters_bully_from_a/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You worrying about hurting the cousin's feelings is doing the same as the father telling the daughter to \"get over it\" it dismisses her feelings.

You can forgive someone for what they did to you without ever feeling the need to interact with them again. Sam is going to be an adult soon. So if Emily  does become a member of the family  your daughter can decide whether or not she wants to attend family events if Emily is there. The big difference in that scenario is your daughter while have a choice.  She can decide to attend for awhile and leave if she feels like she can no longer be around Emily.  She can't in this situation because Emily will be in her home. So either  she will have to hideout in her room or leave her own home because her parents felt it was ok for her form bully to be in their home.", "The thing is, your home (which is also Sam's home) should be a safe place for her. It should be the place your daughter feels most comfortable.\n\nWhen you host events and someone who has done something to your daughter (no matter how far in the past) to make her feel uncomfortable is welcomed at.that event - welcomed into her home, her safe place - it takes aeay that feeling of safety. In essence, it makes her home an uncomfortable space.\n\nIf other people are hosting events and allowing Emily to come, it doesn't have quite the same effect. It is not Sam's home - her safe space - that Emily will be entering. Other people hosting affords your daughter the ability to maintain her safe space and remain comfortable in her own home. \n\nAlso, as someone that has worked with children for many years (and a parent), bullying - no matter how simple or severe it may be - is never really just \"gotten over\". That's not to say that Sam and Emily may never get along, but pressuring her to do so will never work. You can never be quite sure of the affects that a few weeks of bullying behavior will have on the still young and developing mind of a child.\n\nEdited for spelling and a typo", "And then she can stay home.
