We both moved on amicably and she since found a new relationship and had a child in which the dad left her after about six months. \n\nLong story short she came to my apartment and pleaded for somewhere to stay due to having no money. I live by myself in a nice apartment and do not want her or her child inside because the last thing I want is to listen to a baby cry all night or have to endure the smell of when its nappy needs changing. \n\nAs the baby is not mine I don't have any legal obligation to help, so I told them to go buy some blankets to stay warm outside and then called security because they were crying and it was somewhat embarrassing. \n\nHer mum then called me and said I was evil (her mum lives on the other side of the country). I told her why she was wrong but she could not grasp basic legal concepts so I hung up on her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671758547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt2tb5/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_homeless_ex_and_her/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where is the compassion and humility?", "Legally NTA, not your wife, not your kid, not your problem.\n\nMorally YTA. You decide how you live your life of course, though since you both separated amicably, was it so hard to have them for a week or so until they could find alternative accommodation? It sounded like they were quite desperate.\n\nDon't let them stay longer than a month though, that's enough time for ex-MIL to get something together for her own daughter.\n\nI agree with most others here though, if dear ex-MIL wants someone to help, she can foot the moving/accommodation bill. You'd only be doing this out of the kindness of your heart, which doesn't mean you don't have boundaries.", "Yes, you sound like an AH. Are you serious about sending a woman and her baby to sleep outside where it's cold and most definitely dangerous?", "You don't even have to take them in.
