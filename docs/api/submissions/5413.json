We both moved on amicably and she since found a new relationship and had a child in which the dad left her after about six months. \n\nLong story short she came to my apartment and pleaded for somewhere to stay due to having no money. I live by myself in a nice apartment and do not want her or her child inside because the last thing I want is to listen to a baby cry all night or have to endure the smell of when its nappy needs changing. \n\nAs the baby is not mine I don't have any legal obligation to help, so I told them to go buy some blankets to stay warm outside and then called security because they were crying and it was somewhat embarrassing. \n\nHer mum then called me and said I was evil (her mum lives on the other side of the country). I told her why she was wrong but she could not grasp basic legal concepts so I hung up on her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671758547, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zt2tb5/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_homeless_ex_and_her/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All that extra commentary was unnecessary. A simple no would suffice.", "Bit of both imo. Yeah you have your own place and can do what you want with your own property. NTA in that sense sure.

Call your mom for help\u2019 or something to that effect.\n\nI change my mind.

In the morning, you can help her look for other arrangements, but let her have somewhere to stay that night.

Where is the compassion and humility?", "Legally NTA, not your wife, not your kid, not your problem.\n\nMorally YTA. You decide how you live your life of course, though since you both separated amicably, was it so hard to have them for a week or so until they could find alternative accommodation? It sounded like they were quite desperate.\n\nDon't let them stay longer than a month though, that's enough time for ex-MIL to get something together for her own daughter.\n\nI agree with most others here though, if dear ex-MIL wants someone to help, she can foot the moving/accommodation bill. You'd only be doing this out of the kindness of your heart, which doesn't mean you don't have boundaries.", "Yes, you sound like an AH. Are you serious about sending a woman and her baby to sleep outside where it's cold and most definitely dangerous?", "You don't even have to take them in.

But this just doesn\u2019t sound like the same kind of situation.", "We aren\u2019t talking about a random, homeless person. We are talking about someone who was in a relationship with, where things ended in good terms. Big, big difference. \n\nUnless there is something OP is leaving out in his story\u2026", "Also, her mom could have transferred some money to find a hotel for the night", "Hope you are such an altruistic person you take in people in to your house when they are in need ;) would be a shame if you spoke empty words, and tbh, better be safe than sorry like op is doing.", "Maybe you can message OP and Venmo the girl money to stay in a hotel.", "That\u2019s a risk he does not have any obligation to take. She could be an addict and there\u2019s no telling what they do. Theft, violence and do I have to mention again it\u2019s his home and he is under no obligation to allow anyone to live with him. \nThere are countless shelters and many that only allow women. His home, his choice and I would make the same call.", "yes but she could\u2019ve told him all that at the door after not seeing him for 2 years. which would be very manipulative of her", "If my ex showed up with a child on a cold winter night, I\u2019d absolutely let them stay that night and figure out a plan in the morning. While I have my own issues with my ex, I wouldn\u2019t just tell a small baby to go sleep in the streets.", "Considering OP\u2019s attitude, I very much doubt that money would go to his ex. I do, however, regularly donate and volunteer with a refugee resettlement group that is near and dear to my heart. A lot of what we do is helping them find places to stay and getting them what they need to start their lives here. I also happen to teach many of their children as I work at our language immersion program. It is definitely a passion of mine helping the resettlement program. It\u2019s also why I know firsthand that shelters often aren\u2019t an option for many varied reasons.", "Well glad you are kind spirit! Hope the other commenter is one too! And merry cristmas you good harted human", "I understand many are passionate about the situation and have sympathy, and OP\u2019s attitude certainly isn\u2019t helping any. But, he is not heartless for not allowing a virtual stranger to live with him. It\u2019s just flat out stupid and could be dangerous. \nA woman and a baby would be hard pressed to be have a shelter, church or charity make accommodations. Besides, going back to an ex when she has friends, family, a baby daddy, baby daddy\u2019s family is very odd.", "He\u2019s heartless for his attitude and not doing anything. There were so many things he could\u2019ve done to help. Instead he basically mocked them and came across as an AH. This isn\u2019t the am I legally in my rights forum. You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions too about who she actually has in her life and that she didn\u2019t already ask them for help. For someone to go back to an ex like that tells me they\u2019ve exhausted all options they could think of. It\u2019s not like she\u2019d been begging him to take her back or anything like that after all."]}
