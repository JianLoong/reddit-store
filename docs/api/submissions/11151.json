We moved in a couple months ago and at the time he told me that he views food as an expression of love and that he would like me to make out dinners on the days that we\u2019re working. As I work from home I am happy to do the majority of the cooking, but since he moved in I\u2019ve been doing almost all of it. I can\u2019t remember the last time he made us a meal since he moved in. I often prepare dinner or do other housework over lunch, and make dinner in the evenings. I feel like I don\u2019t have time to unwind and get away from the house. Even if I decide to go to the gym, the expectation is that I have dinner ready, or that there\u2019s leftovers from the dinner I made the night before. I have made bulk meals before, but he told me that he doesn't like leftovers more than two nights in a row.\n\nLast week was brutally cold outside and his job-site was shut down, he didn\u2019t make dinner then and he hasn\u2019t cooked any meals on the weekends either.\n\nI finally had enough and decided to ask him to cook 1-3 meals a week, it instantly became an argument. He told me that he works long hours doing physical labour as an electrician and that he is in pain. It\u2019s only fair that I make our dinners because I work from home, and that my work isn't as hard as his. Making dinner isn\u2019t that hard any way, \u201cit only takes 30 seconds to take chicken out of the freezer\u201d. He mentioned that I had also stopped making his sandwiches for lunch (I was doing that for about a week before I realized that I was feeling sick of spending so much time in the kitchen) and that I can\u2019t be relied on to get in the habit of making his sandwiches. He also reminded me that making dinner is how I can show him that I love him. \n\nI told him that I really need him to be my partner on this and that him making a few meals a week would be more fair. It\u2019s true that I work from home and that I have much more ability to make dinner because of that, but it\u2019s not my responsibility to make ALL of our dinners. He dismissed my concern and told me that he thought I was making a big deal about this. He didn\u2019t understand why I was so upset. He said that how dinner is managed in our house now is very convenient. \n\nWhat I want is for him to be responsible for 1-3 meals per week, with at least one during the work week. I don\u2019t care if he cooks them, orders in, or picks up something frozen/precooked from the grocery store. And whoever doesn\u2019t make dinner should do the dishes. I want this work load to go from a 100/0 split to an 80/20.\n\nWhen I cook him dinner he sees it as an expression of love, but when I ask him to handle dinner he views it as a chore. He feels loved when I make him a meal, and I want to feel loved in that way too. I feel trapped in this house and that I don\u2019t have a partner on this issue.\n\nWhat should I do?", "created_utc": 1677596625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e9y2u/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_cook_dinner_a_few/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We both see it as an expression of love. He was off work yesterday because of snow and tried to kick me out of the kitchen in the middle of the dinner prep because \"I had done enough\" I hadn't really.... and I was in the MIDDLE of cooking. When I make his lunch, he tells me every day how amazing it was and how special he feels. And when I get too busy to make lunch, he says it's okay and he grabs it himself, (though he would just pack himself instant noodles, and I make the healthy snacks). When neither of us feels like cooking, he makes kraft dinner, or goes out to get something easy.    \nI'm not saying this as like a brag. Like I said, we have problems. One of the reasons I'm so willing to work on those problems though is because I know in my heart that he sees me as a partner, and he wants to take care of me like I want to take care of him. Food, cooking, chores - these are opportunities to do something small and beautiful for your SO, and then the receiver gets the opportunity to show appreciation, and I believe that's the beating heart of a good relationship, and that is what you deserve. You're not the staff. You're a partner, and it sounds like you're doing all the contributing in this relationship. When I entered my relationship from one where the answer to this next question would have been NO, I always asked myself \"Will this man help me change diapers\". Even if you don't want kids, ask yourself, when you get sick, when you break a leg, will this man sacrifice his comfort for yours?

What do you want, and what do you do?\r  \n4) And if you say \"My partner is being kind of a selfish dick\" and someone tells you \"Oh, that's because their love language is selfish dicking, look how adorably selfish their dicking is, you're just not appreciating it properly\" be very, very skeptical.\r  \nJust because that's \"how your partner loves\" doesn't mean it's good enough for you, someone who never buys you a gift isn't \"really\" giving you gifts when they bring you their dirty laundry to wash or leave a pack of gum or a ballpoint pen in the pockets for you to fish out.\r  \nSo why is someone trying so hard to sell you on something that you just told them isn't really working for you?
