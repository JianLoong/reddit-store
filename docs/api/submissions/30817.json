She huffed and said \"it's not a big deal, and it's no longer contagious after a week\". It felt like she was disregarding any requests I was putting forward.

Things we're strictly protecting our children from, because of history, were not protected, or nearly as protected, in their generation and many, if not most, just don't 'get' the 'fuss' and can't force themselves to 'respect' the new boundaries set by the next generation because they think they're ridiculous. The push-back, as I've witnessed, is less out of disrespect and more out of feeling like the effort they do put in is not acknowledged.\n\nListen, I get it.

While the doctor is the source of advice regarding cold sores, they are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1.

That takes about 15 days. The most common way to transmit the virus is by kissing. Also, the best hand washing technique is by washing with warm, soapy water while vigorously scrubbing your hands for a minimum of 15-20 seconds, longer is better. Hand sanitizer in a pinch is OK (it\u2019s better than nothing) but it doesn\u2019t work as well as good old fashioned soap & water.

It was acknowledged, in the beginning, that we didn't know if COVID would be prevented by the new vaccines.  But it did look like severe disease from COVID would be prevented.  They thought it would lessen the burden on hospitals.\n\nThat is also how flu vaccines and pertussis work: It's expected they'll prevent severe manifestations of the actual diseases, not prevent being infected by or being a carrier of the disease. IOW, they may lessen, BUT NOT STOP, transmission.  When flu efficacy rates are reported, they're looking at doctor visits, hospitalizations, and deaths.  Any other conclusions are inferred, not actual.\n\nHow you best protect your babies from pertussis:  1.  Keep sick people away from them and pray that some vaccinated people's symptom-free status doesn't mask them as a potential carrier of infectious disease.  2. Hazmat suits for visitors. 3. No visitors until the baby has had its first vaccinations.
