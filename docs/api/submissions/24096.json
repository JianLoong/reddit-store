She hates it and doesn\u2019t see the point in dating, and has started to be real blunt about it. She is pretty popular at school and there was a incident with one of boys bullied her when she said no to the movies. It fucking sucks for her and I feel really bad for her.\n\nNow we were at the school picnic that happens before the new year starts. It\u2019s nice and she gets to hang with her friends. Now there is a kid in her class that has been crushing on her for a while. I thought it was over when he gave up after she rejected his valentine. He is autistic and I really thought it took him a while to understand due to that. Apparently not, he confessed to her at the picnic and she said no again. I was near by and went over to bail her out, he started trying to convince her to get to know him. My daughter snapped and told him to, \u201c leave me alone you freak, I told you so many times\u201d We soon left after that.\n\nI have been getting calls about teaching my daughter tolerance and that she needs to be punished for that. I have defending her in all of that, the kids mother called and called me an asshole when she learned I am not punishing her.\n\nAITA? A lot of parents thinks so.\n\nYes I taught her how to reject people nicely and firmly. It\u2019s not working for that kid, this has been the fourth time she has rejected him, she made it so clear at valentines. He won\u2019t stop. Also the school was shit when she was bullied.", "created_utc": 1691420385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kn4l3/aita_for_not_punishing_my_daughter_for_how_she/", "score": 11762, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good that your daughter is learning to assert herself. Although normally I\u2019d not be the biggest fan of calling the kid a freak, it sounds like he has been bothering her for a while. \n\nWhat you do NOT want is your daughter accepting attention out of obligation. Today \u201coh he\u2019s autistic\u201d to then \u201coh he\u2019s bipolar\u201d to \u201che\u2019s having a hard time in life getting out of jail.\u201d Shut that shit down.", "NTA , autistic or not, if someone won't take no for an answer, your daughter gets to be as mean as she wants. It's not intolerance, it's just flat out justified anger. Someone teach that kid no means no.\nETA: OP yes you should tell her not to use words like that, educate her on how that's harmful in general, but you're right to not punish her.", "NTA. Your daughter has the right to reject anyone who makes her uncomfortable. She was clear and firm with him, and he should have respected her boundaries. You are a good parent for supporting her and not forcing her to tolerate unwanted attention.", "NTA-She\u2019s tried nice and it got her nowhere. Autistic doesn\u2019t mean free pass to continue to harass someone who has already stated they aren\u2019t interested.", "NTA.  Parents need to teach their boys what \"no\" means.  This was a lesson for him.\n\nIMO people are free to reject people however they want after the first polite rejection.  Anyone who keeps going after that is asking for whatever rudeness they catch.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is being harassed. They should intervene at school since he's not getting the hint.", "NTA. The other kids parents need to teach him not to harass little girls, if he can't stop, homeschool him.\n\nI'm autistic, but if I were to harass someone I would face the consequences.\n\nAlso autistic people can understand direct language and no means no. It's not Like she gave subtle hints.\n\nKids a creep in the making.\n\nEdit: spelling.", "NTA - She didn\u2019t call him a freak because he\u2019s autistic, she called him a freak for harassing her & trying to guilt her into accepting his advances. Sorry but that\u2019s not ok & there\u2019s a lot of issues in disability spaces with men who feel it\u2019s acceptable to harass because society has told them as disabled men they aren\u2019t responsible for their actions.\n\nExit: I\u2019m autistic, my husbands are autistic, if any of us harassed someone FOUR TIMES for a date after repeatedly being told no then being called a freak is the least we\u2019d deserve. Stop excusing predation from men because they\u2019re disabled.", "NTA. Being autistic isn't a get out of jail free card. You taught your daughter to be firm, and to take no nonsense from people who feel entitled to her feelings. Your daughter taught that boy that if you don't listen when people say no they will *make* you listen.\n\nTo undo that would teach your daughter that she should subjugate her emotions for the sake of the emotions of others, and would teach the boy that he is special *because* he is different and therefore entitled to more. Which I'm guessing his mother taught him anyway.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't owe anyone her time and attention. That kid who has been stalking her and won't take no for an answer should be disciplined and have consequences for continually harassing girls who don't want to go out with him.", "NTA\n\n Just cause he is autistic doesn't mean your daughter can't have boundaries.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter shouldn't have to put up with harrasment. If there's an autistic kid bothering her, then the teachers/adults around need to mitigate that situation, not a 12 year old girl. You tried to do this, but your daughter just beat you to it; and of course she doesn't have any nuance, she's young and was being harassed.", "NTA. She's being harassed.", "NTA. Your daughter is being harassed by this boy. It doesn't matter if he's autistic, it doesn't matter if he's the nicest boy in the world! Her answer is no! People are constantly made to feel bad for not liking someone back and it's just not fair. Your daughter had a limit and it was reached. Someone needs to be telling that boy to back off.", "This kid is stalking and harassing her. Because it\u2019s happened this many times it\u2019s now classified as sexual harassment. They do not get to hide this under the autism banner. No means no and he knows what that means. Email the teacher, principal, counselor, CC the school board, go all the way up the chain. Hell, even whoever might manage his IEP. They are letting this boy stalk and harass your kid. Go nuclear. You are NTA and neither is your kid for reaching her breaking point. This already would have been dealt with if this kid didn\u2019t have autism and I am both heartbroken and raging for your daughter.", "There was this story some time back, where a kid (think 10-14) was being groped and harassed by her autistic classmate and constantly being told by the teachers she should be more nice and patient and understanding towards him due to his disability. The classmate never harassed anyone else from that grade, so I seriously doubt it was due to his illness. The victim had eventually a breakdown apparently and broke the classmate's nose in one of the groping instances. She has difficulties forgiving her parents for not doing anything in time and probably has a long time of healing ahead.\n\nSo I believe this is a very difficult situation and potentially scary. Calling anyone a freak should not be supported and you should let her know that.  But it is not okay to disrespect a firm \"No\" on multiple occasions. Ask for a meeting with his parents, best with the school as a mediator, and tell them while you made sure you explained to your daughter that namecalling won't solve anything and can hurt people, you insist they cooperate with you in making their son aware that he was rejected and being persistent any further consists of harassing his classmate, which is unacceptable. \n\nNo means no, whoever is your pursuer. \n\nNTA for defending your daughter, but do it in an adult way so you lead a good example for her.", "NTA.  And good on you for stepping in to help your daughter out of an uncomfortable situation.\n\nI hope that when the boy's mother reached out to you about punishing your daughter, you demanded that she teach her son about boundaries and about accepting \"no\" for an answer.\n\nThere are varying levels of autism, but if the boy is able to be in school, he is probably able to be taught and understand boundaries.  \n\nWhile I dislike name-calling, I'm not going to say that your daughter was out of line in this instance.  She's 12, and this whole situation must be overwhelming for her.  It's unwanted attention, she's already said no to this boy several times, and he doesn't respect her answer.  Add to that the prior experience of being bullied for saying no, and I can absolutely see why your daughter snapped.  \n\nYour daughter was tolerant in the past.  She was nice but firm.  It didn't work.  She's under no obligation to be tolerant of others who don't respect her.", "NTA. Most autistic people understand that no means no. Talk to your daughter and ask if she was saying it because he's handicapped or because he's overly persistent. Agreesivly persistent people can cause someone to think they are a freak or creap.  Just gross and icky. Someone saying no isn't exactly a social que.  It's a direct firm answer.", "Nta.\n\nYour daughter should absolutely not apologize. That would give the impression to your daughter and the boy that she is the one that did something wrong for rejecting him. And that is completely false. \n\nYour daughter did use the wrong word and I suggest talking to her about that. Next time use the word pervert or narcissist - or whatever other word you wish for someone that thinks they are entitled to the attention of someone else.\n\nI get the fact the boy is autistic and might have trouble understanding social cues. But it is not your daughter's job to educate him. And it is certainly not her role to put up with unwanted attention.", "NTA sure he's autistic and he might not understand social cues, but she made it obvious on the second time, even a person who's deaf and blind would feel the vibrations coming from her and understand what she meant, and the fact that he wanted to convince her despite being rejected for the second time proves that you and your daughter aren't in the wrong in that situation, he is, though the \"freak\" part is debatable", "NTA. Autistic people can also be perpetrators. They can also be taught to respect boundaries etc. Your daughter was nice several times and when that didn\u2019t work she stood up for herself more forcefully.", ">I have been getting calls about teaching my daughter tolerance and that she needs to be punished for that.\n\nOnce again, none of the boys are expected to be punished for not accepting no, are they ? \n\nSigh. This poor girl is 12, she's a tween, and she's already having to deal with this crap. It's fun to be a girl. \n\nNTA - you taught your daughter well. Shame that the parents of those boys haven't done their job. \n\nOh, and being autistic doesn't get anyone a get out of jail card for bad behaviour - the mother of this child is failing him by teaching him the exact opposite.", "NTA. \n\nI think it was last year in a similar situation in the news where the whole school became the kid\u2019s Valentines\u2019 the next day. People were cruel to the girl who turned him down. While that was so kind and sweet of the classmates, this also had a double edge sword of \u201cno means yes\u201d.  \n\nEverytime this kid comes to her and is indeed harassing her, she needs to tell the school she feels unsafe. Ignore him and b-line for a teacher. That may be extreme but it seems like parents are allowing this behavior. How the F does his mom know you didn\u2019t punish your child?", "NTA. Sexual harassment is sexual harassment regardless of a diagnosis. It is past time for the boy's parents to teach him this. He may get into serious trouble soon.\n\nTalking about serious trouble, talk to a lawyer and tell the school that you are doing so. Tolerance of unwanted sexual advances, really?", "NTA.\n\nPlease talk to the school about what is happening between your daughter and the other kid before it escalates into something huge. I\u2019m saying this because you said the boy asked your daughter out 4 times, and he won\u2019t take no for an answer (I blame his parents for this). He will try again unless to put an end to it now.", "[deleted]", "NTA - I'm sure she tried to be nice to him the first time but it sounds like this is turning into harassment. Poor girl. She may have to report him to the school if he won't take no for an answer and leave her alone.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm kind of grossed out by how many comments are telling you that your daughter needs to be more polite with her language. Politeness is nice, of course, but not necessary when someone is crossing established boundaries.\n\nIt's maddening to think that it some places you'd be considered justified for shooting someone who broke into your home (crossed a boundary but didn't physically hurt you) but girls are not justified calling a boy names after he crossed her boundaries. \n\nAutism or not, the assholes in this situation are the ones teaching boys that they deserve politeness and kindness from girls, even if they're actively crossing their boundaries.", "The main lesson is that NO MEANS NO. When that doesn't work, then it's time to inflict a little pain.", "I\u2019m so glad you called to discuss your son\u2019s inappropriate behavior! I\u2019d like to hear what punishment you think is appropriate for sexually harassing my daughter?", "NTA. You could teach her substitutes for the word freak but like, it\u2019s not that big of a deal compared to the kid not leaving her alone.\n\nThe kid\u2019s mom really had the audacity to call you and say you\u2019re the AH? Call her back! Tell her to get her kid to leave yours the f alone and there won\u2019t be any more problems! Go to the school about it!", "NTA\n\nNo means no. If he didn\u2019t get the message delivered in a nice way, maybe he\u2019ll get it this time.", "NTA.  He may struggle with social cues, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t understand what no means.  And honestly, F politeness at this point.  Sometimes we have to blunt and your daughter shouldn\u2019t think she has to always \u201cbe nice.\u201d", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t need to learn \u201ctolerance\u201d for sexual harassment. You should tell everyone who calls you that they need to learn that \u201cno means no.\u201d The kid\u2019s mother especially needs to be told this.", "Nta. She felt harassed by him and retaliated.", "NTA. Either this child is taught to accept a no now or they are going to have a problem on their hands later. His disability doesn't make everyone responsible for him.\n\nAnd, since the parents seem to think your daughter is responsible for this situation, tell the school that either they keep him away from her or you are filing a restraining order.", "Might be an unpopular opinion, but if you are unable to understand the word \u201cno\u201d, then you are unfit to participate in society. \n\nI\u2019d have told that parent that if she can\u2019t educate her child to that most basic of standards, she needs to have him institutionalized. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of people using disabilities or illness to justify shitty behavior.\n\nNTA", " NTA. Unfortunately your daughter is already dealing with guys feeling entitled to her because they like her. So frustrating. I\u2019m not surprised she snapped as she was pushed to the edge and was being harassed.", "NTA. \n\nIf she did it once, and he kept pestering her, then I don't think she needs to be punished. \n\nI think its fine for you to talk to her about it.  But when someone keeps pushing past your boundaries, then sometimes their reactions won't be great.", "Nta, she said no multiple times. \n\nMaybe his parents should teach him how to not harass girls and take no for an answer", "NTA. I think the issue here is how loaded \u201cfreak\u201d can be with regards to neurodivergent people, but it\u2019s pretty clear that wasn\u2019t what your daughter meant and I\u2019d wager she\u2019d have used the word \u201cfreak\u201d whoever was harassing her. Kids don\u2019t have the biggest vocabulary for things like this and can\u2019t be expected to inherently know how their words might come across, especially when they\u2019re upset. The boys behaviour was not remotely okay and he *needs* to learn that he can\u2019t treat girls like this before it gets worse, being autistic doesn\u2019t make you unable to discern between right and wrong nor does it make it okay to overstep boundaries or forgo consent. \n\nI don\u2019t believe she needs to be punished or that either of you have done anything wrong, but the school and parents will only be hearing that she called an autistic boy a freak. They\u2019ll not be seeing the context, which is extremely important here. It might be worth explaining to your daughter that \u201cfreak\u201d wasn\u2019t the best word to use and then speaking with the school/parents about her intent and reasoning and *maybe* say something along the lines of \u201cwe are sorry for using that word, but not sorry for how she spoke to him, because the way he\u2019s been treating her is unacceptable and she had every right to stand up for herself\u201d \n\nBest of luck to you both.", "NTA while I don\u2019t like the word freak, this boy crossed a boundary and she was defending herself against unwanted attention", "i think those saying Y.T.A should read some of op\u2019s comments..", "NTA. Autism isn't an excuse to not take no for an answer. He needs to learn now before he's an adult and ends up with a record or a face full of pepper spray. His parents should have taught him that.", "NTA. I say that as a person with autism who was once a pretty girl in middle school and who dealt with similar bullshit. His autism isn't an excuse for his shitty behavior and pressuring your daughter. If he can't respect the word no, he doesn't then get to play the victim card. Encourage your daughter to continue shutting that crap down. People kept berating me to be nicer and it was incredibly damaging to me in the long term. She is allowed to say no and demand her answer be respected.", "NTA, but the autistic kid's parents sure are. They need to teach their kid that when someone says 'no' once, he shouldn't ask again. This isn't a pyramid scheme where you ask 7 times before accepting no as an answer.\n\nMy son (9) is autistic and I stay on him about social cues and consent. A lot of people think I am harsh, but the world does not give AF about somebody's disability. Also (as much as I love my son), autism is a very self centred disorder for high functioning people. I have to teach my kid to take other people's experience into perspective.", "NTA and I say this as an autistic person: sometimes we get too locked onto something and we need a harsh dose of reality to kind of reset. It's unpleasant and it feels bad but if he's not too autistic there's a good chance your daughter helped him by making his brain go \"okay that was unacceptable,  don't do exactly that again\"", "As the parent of an autistic son, NTA. Yes, sometimes autistic folks miss social cues, but if she was flat out saying no, there is no excuse. No one deserves to be harassed. \n\nAs for the \"freak\" statement - she was calling him a freak because he was harassing her, not because he's autistic, and tbh I'm not offended in the slightest. \n\nI hope someone calls my son out like this if necessary because neither him nor I want him to be allowed to cross boundaries because the other person isn't comfortable enough to be direct.", "NTA. I don't blame her for not wanting to be with the Autistic kid. My Fiance said yes when an autistic guy proposed to her and now he annoys her all the time \ud83d\ude02", "YWNBTA\n\nAs long as you step in an let your daughter know that name calling is never appropriate.  Praise her for her strength to stand up for herself.  Praise her for her previous handling of the situation.  But let her know that cracking and then engaging in base behavior, like name calling, is never appropriate.  That is allowing her to stoop to a lower level when it sounds like she is better than that.\n\nBesides, we all know how this stuff can be a slippery slope and, if she feels that she is justified in calling one kid a \"freak\", what will she do the next time she feels pressured?  What if the other student is black, or Asian, or Jewish, or some other minority?\n\nSo, I think this is a case where you just need to take the time to explain to her how you're proud at how she's handling the situation, proud how she's stood up for herself, but let her know that she always needs to keep her head in every situation... it will really benefit her in the long run.\n\nI also agree with u/litt3lli0n's comment.  I think this is well beyond the time for you to reach out to the school's Guidance Counsellor and request a mediated meeting between yourself and the boy's parents.  It doesn't need to be confrontational... just let them know that their son is of that age where he's starting to take notice of girls, and he's developed a childhood crush on your daughter.  Tell them that she has repeatedly and kindly tried to let him know she's not interested, but that he keeps pursuing her in a way that is making her very uncomfortable.  They should then be able to discuss this with their son, **and** you now have it on record with the school in case it does not stop so your daughter can go back to the Guidance Counsellor with complaints going forward.\n\nSo, just have that conversation with your daughter.  She's at a very impressionable age and praising her for all she did right, and gently letting her know what she did wrong will help nip that in the bud.", "NTA. Still calling people \"freak\" (and insulting people in general) should be avoided.", "NTA - It is on the parent\u2019s of the boy to help him understand social interactions and \u201cno means no.\u201d You\u2019re daughter has been dealing with unwanted attention and has every right to go off when it keeps happening and the school and parents don\u2019t take accountability and address the boys.", "NTA thank you for protecting your daughter", "NTA Your daughter doesn't owe politeness to the boy who is harassing her. You are doing a great jod standing up for her and not sweeping this under the rug like so many parents might have. Don't back down and don't apologize.", "NTA. He's harassing her at this point and this kid's parents are setting him up for failure by not teaching him boundaries. He's autistic, not stupid. They're doing him a massive disservice by not correcting his behavior. Soon he won't be a precocious teenager with a crush. He'll be a full blown adult who's never even told no or accepted boundaries from other people and that's incredibly dangerous.", "NtA how bout we stop having to punish young women for attitudes/kindness and instead we teach young men that no means no and how to deal with+ rejection.", "NTA\n\nThe mother needs to teach her son to accept rejection and boundaries. It\u2019s disgusting that they\u2019re putting the onus on your daughter. Yes, calling him a freak was uncalled for and rude, but she\u2019s said no nicely and politely four times previously. \n\nHis autism is not an excuse for shitty behaviour and him harassing your daughter and continuing to ask her out after being told no is shitty behaviour.", "NTA and I'm tired of the narrative that girls should be polite/proper with their words/actions. This has gone on long enough; the school did nothing about it and I'm sure the boys parents have/will do nothing about their son's actions so enough is enough! \n\nEveryone has their breaking point, children included.", "It's 2023, the era of preserving men's feelings after being told no is ending. Idgaf if he's autistic, that's not a blank check to trample on other women's boundaries. Little girls shouldn't have to martyr themselves to appease little boys. \n\nNTA", "NTA my daughter dealt with this and it can actually get quite scary quite young. No means no.", "NTA Make no mistake. **Your daughter was being sexually harassed** and the school failed to stop it.  the other child's mother is making allowances for her child but failing to understand what he is doing. She is doing him no favors by shielding him.", "Hell no. NTA. As someone with autism myself, you and your daughter are in the clear.", "NTA, and if you punish your kid for saying no, you risk encouraging her to be a doormat for future abusers to walk all over.\n\nHelp her practice saying, \"No means no!\" without the \"freak\" part.", "NTA. As an autistic person and parent of children an autistic person, I find the worst thing is teaching my daughter unrealistic expectations of the real world.", "NTA - your daughter should teach a class to other kids on harassment.\n\n**We do not have to be kind to people who aren\u2019t kind to us!** Especially when being hounded when being nice.\n\nAnd this young man needs to learn that no means no.", "Nta, your daughter is 12 and has been dealing with alot this boy asking her is the se as any other and she can reject who she wants. \n\nMy question is, where did her language come from. Was she saying freak because is autistic, or was it just her saying stop being weird  as she would anyone else. I think the issue is the assumption of it being the boys autism, if it is that reason then your daughter needs to learn  you can't call people with differences that. If not and it was her not even realizing it then explain that to the parent. \n\nAs for the school, if they won't do anything about bullying go higher up or go online and call them out", "NTA, and awesome job empowering your daughter to advocate for herself.", "Good for you and your daughter. No one should have to put up with harassment autistic or not. Hurt feelings aren't the end of the world.", "NTA, in no universe should anyone be taught to \"tolerate\" harassment. Tolerance does not require accepting abuse or other poor treatment, including harassment).\n\nI would not punish my daughter and would in fact applaud her for being assertive.  I also would follow up with the school and ask what they are doing about the fact that she is being bullied and harassed for not reciprocating romantic overtures from boys.", "NTA.  Your daughter was being repeatedly harassed and the only way to stop it was to yell at him.\n\nWould it have been better to avoid the name-calling?  Sure, but it\u2019s a completely reasonable reaction to the harassment she was being exposed to.  Unfortunately, in this case it gave ammunition to the boy\u2019s enablers, but that still doesn\u2019t mean she was in the wrong.", "Sorry but being Autistic is no excuse. He has sexually harassed your daughter is now stalking her. Time for a stay away letter to the school and the parents and if that doesn\u2019t work? A protective order. His actions are completely unacceptable. If he keeps it up in the adult world he will be in trouble with the law so fast his head will spin. NO is a complete sentence", "A lot of moms are feminists until someone hurts their precious wittle boy. My mom is like this. Self proclaimed feminist,  supporter of equal rights and pay, etc., you don't owe any man your body.... Except somehow  all my brothers exes are evil selfish crazy sluts.", "I mean it's hard right? Is he a freak for being autistic? Absolutely not. But is it also extremely uncomfortable when someone can't take no for an answer? Absolutely. \n\nI think what would be best moving forward is to teach your daughter how to firmly do this without feeling the need to use harmful names/slurs.

One day he cornered me in the changing room's corner and wanted to force a kiss. He was a lot bigger than me, so I did the only thing I could think of - when his face was close enough to mine, I bit his cheek, hard. My parents would never punish me for it, but the teachers did - I had to spend 30 minutes standing in the corner, and I was scolded because 'violence is wrong and he just wanted a kiss'. It's been over 25 years and I'm still pissed. No way in hell you should punish her.", "NTA\n\nA polite no is the first step. Continuing to ask after that gets you far less polite responses.

And weirdly that\u2019s the crux of the issue. \n\nThe language we have about special needs or even labels like autism or adhd often either do one of two things. \n\n1. It gives room for people to undercut the capabilities of someone who has that diagnosis. Thus creating parent and community structures that both don\u2019t support people properly or in the worst cases allow for bad behavior to slip by unchecked that could reasonably be addressed thereby setting these people up for the best success that they can have. By not supporting people properly you don\u2019t give them the chance to discover their talents and the things that make them special. And this even happens outside of special Ed. Who all knows of someone who fell through the cracks and didn\u2019t graduate high school because they had issues keeping up in school. \n\n2. Ostracize these individuals. Because when the whole community tells Op and their daughter to just deal and be nice it\u2019s creating a situation for this kid where they feel like they are often less connected or separate from the rest of the community. Instead hold this kid accountable and work with him (especially as he is 12 and not a lost cause) about what boundaries mean and why they are important. Just like you would with any other kid. \n\nMy mom often talks about how she prefers the term specialized education for this reason. Since there are a million reasons someone might or might not need an accommodation. My sister needed some assistance with an anxiety disorder. I needed help with keeping organized and when I was younger I was put in a group to help with social skills and that group helped my longtime friend with learning English and grammar.

I couldn\u2019t read body language very well at that age. And even if they made it clear, I\u2019d have a hard time accepting the rejection and I\u2019d have a hard time with boundaries. But eventually I\u2019d get it and accept it. After a couple of crushes, I decided to just live my life and not worry about getting a girlfriend and just try to be nice to people and if I find a romantic partner through that, that\u2019s fantastic. That strategy worked, because 8 year later now I have a girlfriend who I\u2019ve been dating for the last three years and I\u2019ve never been happier.\n\nHopefully this boy goes through the same realization and learns to keep his boundaries and recognize he needs to back off.

I also grew up being sexually abused by a friend of the family so close to the family that they were considered family.  I was so young when it started that I don\u2019t even remember the first time it happened.  What I can remember is the first time I ever called him a jerk.  As he walked away I remember being so worried that I\u2019d get into trouble for calling a grownup a jerk.  I didn\u2019t realize at that age that he\u2019d never in a million years have told on me to my parents - because then I might tell on him.  And HIS \u201cwrong\u201d was so much greater than MY \u201cwrong\u201d that my \u201cwrong\u201d would be all but forgotten.  My child mind did not understand that.  So that\u2019s the one & only time I was ever brave enough to call him a name.  \n\nAs an adult, I raised 2 children (both adults now).  I taught my children to be polite & respect others who earned it.  I also taught them to defend & stand up for themselves in any way that they felt that they needed to to be safe.\n\nI didn\u2019t want either of my children (my son who was neurotypical or my daughter who was neurodivergent) to hesitate to defend themselves for even one moment because they might get into trouble for something that they said.  \n\nAdults like you create children like I was - good kids who hesitate to defend themselves because they don\u2019t want to be bad &/or get into trouble.  Since the perpetrator (whether it be adult or child) isn\u2019t the least bit concerned with being bad &/or getting into trouble, that always places the victim in the position where they are more than likely going to continue to be victimized.  \n\nSo any one of you who thinks OP\u2019s daughter should be reprimanded needs to rethink your philosophy - especially if you work with SN children who can be more vulnerable to abuse than neurotypical children.", "Thank you for teaching you daughter she doesn't need to kowtow to men.", "Many parents are ok with their baby boy sexually harrassing, and even assaulting, girls and women.

I would advise her to not call him \"freak\" as that could come off as ableist, but maybe that came out subconsciously due to frustration. Plus, you have stated you have told her to reject people nicely and firmly, so it sounds like the name calling part was not because of you. I've had to face the truth that many people don't want to be friends with me not just because I am socially abnormal, but because some people just don't want to be friends with you. It hurts, but that's life. It was more evident when I became your daughter's age, so this might be a good opportunity for a lesson for the other child to learn before the situation could get worse like it did in my case, which I am about to get to. I'm also AFAB and I've noticed people have more sympathy to AMABs autistics when it comes to this than for AFAB autistics. \n\nI've had a similar experience to this. Here's where the story comes in. When I was in middle school, I had a friend who was a boy (let's call him Sam) who I sat with at lunch everyday until midway through 8th grade. He was also autistic, but I did not know this until later. I stopped sitting with him because I had a dream about him that greatly weirded me out and made me very uncomfortable near him from then on (I know, this is a bad reason to end a friendship with him given the dream was not real, I highly regret what I did). Anyways, he was greatly upset by this and would try very hard to get me to be friends with him again.\n\nEventually, his mom ended up being a patient of my mom (who is a nurse) and told her how I was avoiding him. My mom got very upset with me and told me to start talking to him again. This gave me the idea to act very weird to him as in snorting when I was around him, giving him strange gifts (a badly drawn picture of him as a cat and an old VHS tape (this was 2009, so VHS had been phased out for the most part by this point)), and telling him outrageous lies. My intention was not to bully him, but to weird him out to the point to where he would lose interest in me. Even though I was doing this, by the time the school year ended, his mom called my mom every single day to ask her if they could arrange a \"play date\" whether it be at the movies or going to the park or whatever.\n\nAfter a month of this, his mom met up with my mom again (likely through a follow up appointment) and convinced her to have a \"play date\" at their house that would take place the very next day. She gave in even though she know I really did not want to continue a friendship with him. When she brought it up, I said No, over and over. She said, Yes, over and over. She was greatly defensive about this and when I asked why she would not let me be myself in this situation, she blurted out, \"Because his mom wants this\". I had no idea that his mom was calling my mom all this time. When I told my dad about this, he became exasperated and said, \"Please do this\" as in he knew this was going on, too.\n\nI even heard someone in my family (I forgot who) quietly but not quiet enough to where I wouldn't notice it ask my mom, \"Does she (me) know the consequences if she doesn't do this\" as if I would have been punished or something else if I did not go through. After at least an hour of guilt tripping and begging me to go on this \"play date\", they told me that Sam was autistic. I initially thought that this was a lie so I could be pressured to feel bad about this and empathize with him since I am of course autistic myself.\n\nI eventually said yes mainly due to how my parents were not at all giving in to how I desperately did not want to do this. My mom became elated and rewarded me with boxes of Klondike bars. I never liked those bars even before then and because of this conundrum, I hated them even more. The play date went along as scheduled. It was super awkward and strained, but we gave them what they wanted. On the way home, my mom broke the awkward silence by telling me, \"Please don't tell anyone I told you he's autistic\". This made me think that this was even more of a lie until I ran into someone who was a part of my parent's \"Autism Parent support groups\" and they mentioned Sam.\n\nWhat made think that my parents forcing this relationship with Sam and making me go on this play date was strange was because this was at an age where I should be allowed to understand these sorts of boundaries and (as I stated earlier) because I had been in similar situations myself where people did not want to be friends with me. I knew that life was unfair with how some people will want to stop talking to you even after you had been so close with them. It seems like either Sam did not understand this or his mom wanted to paint this unrealistic picture of a life where none of this happens.\n\nEdit: Fixed spelling errors and added more context where needed.", "NTA.
