She hates it and doesn\u2019t see the point in dating, and has started to be real blunt about it. She is pretty popular at school and there was a incident with one of boys bullied her when she said no to the movies. It fucking sucks for her and I feel really bad for her.\n\nNow we were at the school picnic that happens before the new year starts. It\u2019s nice and she gets to hang with her friends. Now there is a kid in her class that has been crushing on her for a while. I thought it was over when he gave up after she rejected his valentine. He is autistic and I really thought it took him a while to understand due to that. Apparently not, he confessed to her at the picnic and she said no again. I was near by and went over to bail her out, he started trying to convince her to get to know him. My daughter snapped and told him to, \u201c leave me alone you freak, I told you so many times\u201d We soon left after that.\n\nI have been getting calls about teaching my daughter tolerance and that she needs to be punished for that. I have defending her in all of that, the kids mother called and called me an asshole when she learned I am not punishing her.\n\nAITA? A lot of parents thinks so.\n\nYes I taught her how to reject people nicely and firmly. It\u2019s not working for that kid, this has been the fourth time she has rejected him, she made it so clear at valentines. He won\u2019t stop. Also the school was shit when she was bullied.", "created_utc": 1691420385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15kn4l3/aita_for_not_punishing_my_daughter_for_how_she/", "score": 2715, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good that your daughter is learning to assert herself. Although normally I\u2019d not be the biggest fan of calling the kid a freak, it sounds like he has been bothering her for a while. \n\nWhat you do NOT want is your daughter accepting attention out of obligation. Today \u201coh he\u2019s autistic\u201d to then \u201coh he\u2019s bipolar\u201d to \u201che\u2019s having a hard time in life getting out of jail.\u201d Shut that shit down.", "NTA , autistic or not, if someone won't take no for an answer, your daughter gets to be as mean as she wants. It's not intolerance, it's just flat out justified anger. Someone teach that kid no means no.\nETA: OP yes you should tell her not to use words like that, educate her on how that's harmful in general, but you're right to not punish her.", "NTA. Your daughter has the right to reject anyone who makes her uncomfortable. She was clear and firm with him, and he should have respected her boundaries. You are a good parent for supporting her and not forcing her to tolerate unwanted attention.", "NTA-She\u2019s tried nice and it got her nowhere. Autistic doesn\u2019t mean free pass to continue to harass someone who has already stated they aren\u2019t interested.", "NTA.  Parents need to teach their boys what \"no\" means.  This was a lesson for him.\n\nIMO people are free to reject people however they want after the first polite rejection.  Anyone who keeps going after that is asking for whatever rudeness they catch.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is being harassed. They should intervene at school since he's not getting the hint.", "NTA. The other kids parents need to teach him not to harass little girls, if he can't stop, homeschool him.\n\nI'm autistic, but if I were to harass someone I would face the consequences.\n\nAlso autistic people can understand direct language and no means no. It's not Like she gave subtle hints.\n\nKids a creep in the making.\n\nEdit: spelling.", "NTA - She didn\u2019t call him a freak because he\u2019s autistic, she called him a freak for harassing her & trying to guilt her into accepting his advances. Sorry but that\u2019s not ok & there\u2019s a lot of issues in disability spaces with men who feel it\u2019s acceptable to harass because society has told them as disabled men they aren\u2019t responsible for their actions.\n\nExit: I\u2019m autistic, my husbands are autistic, if any of us harassed someone FOUR TIMES for a date after repeatedly being told no then being called a freak is the least we\u2019d deserve. Stop excusing predation from men because they\u2019re disabled.", "NTA. Being autistic isn't a get out of jail free card. You taught your daughter to be firm, and to take no nonsense from people who feel entitled to her feelings. Your daughter taught that boy that if you don't listen when people say no they will *make* you listen.\n\nTo undo that would teach your daughter that she should subjugate her emotions for the sake of the emotions of others, and would teach the boy that he is special *because* he is different and therefore entitled to more. Which I'm guessing his mother taught him anyway.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't owe anyone her time and attention. That kid who has been stalking her and won't take no for an answer should be disciplined and have consequences for continually harassing girls who don't want to go out with him.", "NTA\n\n Just cause he is autistic doesn't mean your daughter can't have boundaries.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter shouldn't have to put up with harrasment. If there's an autistic kid bothering her, then the teachers/adults around need to mitigate that situation, not a 12 year old girl. You tried to do this, but your daughter just beat you to it; and of course she doesn't have any nuance, she's young and was being harassed.", "NTA. She's being harassed.", "NTA. Your daughter is being harassed by this boy. It doesn't matter if he's autistic, it doesn't matter if he's the nicest boy in the world! Her answer is no! People are constantly made to feel bad for not liking someone back and it's just not fair. Your daughter had a limit and it was reached. Someone needs to be telling that boy to back off.", "This kid is stalking and harassing her. Because it\u2019s happened this many times it\u2019s now classified as sexual harassment. They do not get to hide this under the autism banner. No means no and he knows what that means. Email the teacher, principal, counselor, CC the school board, go all the way up the chain. Hell, even whoever might manage his IEP. They are letting this boy stalk and harass your kid. Go nuclear. You are NTA and neither is your kid for reaching her breaking point. This already would have been dealt with if this kid didn\u2019t have autism and I am both heartbroken and raging for your daughter.", "There was this story some time back, where a kid (think 10-14) was being groped and harassed by her autistic classmate and constantly being told by the teachers she should be more nice and patient and understanding towards him due to his disability. The classmate never harassed anyone else from that grade, so I seriously doubt it was due to his illness. The victim had eventually a breakdown apparently and broke the classmate's nose in one of the groping instances. She has difficulties forgiving her parents for not doing anything in time and probably has a long time of healing ahead.\n\nSo I believe this is a very difficult situation and potentially scary. Calling anyone a freak should not be supported and you should let her know that.  But it is not okay to disrespect a firm \"No\" on multiple occasions. Ask for a meeting with his parents, best with the school as a mediator, and tell them while you made sure you explained to your daughter that namecalling won't solve anything and can hurt people, you insist they cooperate with you in making their son aware that he was rejected and being persistent any further consists of harassing his classmate, which is unacceptable. \n\nNo means no, whoever is your pursuer. \n\nNTA for defending your daughter, but do it in an adult way so you lead a good example for her.", "NTA.  And good on you for stepping in to help your daughter out of an uncomfortable situation.\n\nI hope that when the boy's mother reached out to you about punishing your daughter, you demanded that she teach her son about boundaries and about accepting \"no\" for an answer.\n\nThere are varying levels of autism, but if the boy is able to be in school, he is probably able to be taught and understand boundaries.  \n\nWhile I dislike name-calling, I'm not going to say that your daughter was out of line in this instance.  She's 12, and this whole situation must be overwhelming for her.  It's unwanted attention, she's already said no to this boy several times, and he doesn't respect her answer.  Add to that the prior experience of being bullied for saying no, and I can absolutely see why your daughter snapped.  \n\nYour daughter was tolerant in the past.  She was nice but firm.  It didn't work.  She's under no obligation to be tolerant of others who don't respect her.", "NTA. Most autistic people understand that no means no. Talk to your daughter and ask if she was saying it because he's handicapped or because he's overly persistent. Agreesivly persistent people can cause someone to think they are a freak or creap.  Just gross and icky. Someone saying no isn't exactly a social que.  It's a direct firm answer.", "Nta.\n\nYour daughter should absolutely not apologize. That would give the impression to your daughter and the boy that she is the one that did something wrong for rejecting him. And that is completely false. \n\nYour daughter did use the wrong word and I suggest talking to her about that. Next time use the word pervert or narcissist - or whatever other word you wish for someone that thinks they are entitled to the attention of someone else.\n\nI get the fact the boy is autistic and might have trouble understanding social cues. But it is not your daughter's job to educate him. And it is certainly not her role to put up with unwanted attention.", "NTA sure he's autistic and he might not understand social cues, but she made it obvious on the second time, even a person who's deaf and blind would feel the vibrations coming from her and understand what she meant, and the fact that he wanted to convince her despite being rejected for the second time proves that you and your daughter aren't in the wrong in that situation, he is, though the \"freak\" part is debatable", "NTA. Autistic people can also be perpetrators. They can also be taught to respect boundaries etc. Your daughter was nice several times and when that didn\u2019t work she stood up for herself more forcefully.", ">I have been getting calls about teaching my daughter tolerance and that she needs to be punished for that.\n\nOnce again, none of the boys are expected to be punished for not accepting no, are they ? \n\nSigh. This poor girl is 12, she's a tween, and she's already having to deal with this crap. It's fun to be a girl. \n\nNTA - you taught your daughter well. Shame that the parents of those boys haven't done their job. \n\nOh, and being autistic doesn't get anyone a get out of jail card for bad behaviour - the mother of this child is failing him by teaching him the exact opposite.", "NTA. \n\nI think it was last year in a similar situation in the news where the whole school became the kid\u2019s Valentines\u2019 the next day. People were cruel to the girl who turned him down. While that was so kind and sweet of the classmates, this also had a double edge sword of \u201cno means yes\u201d.  \n\nEverytime this kid comes to her and is indeed harassing her, she needs to tell the school she feels unsafe. Ignore him and b-line for a teacher. That may be extreme but it seems like parents are allowing this behavior. How the F does his mom know you didn\u2019t punish your child?", "NTA. Sexual harassment is sexual harassment regardless of a diagnosis. It is past time for the boy's parents to teach him this. He may get into serious trouble soon.\n\nTalking about serious trouble, talk to a lawyer and tell the school that you are doing so. Tolerance of unwanted sexual advances, really?", "NTA.\n\nPlease talk to the school about what is happening between your daughter and the other kid before it escalates into something huge. I\u2019m saying this because you said the boy asked your daughter out 4 times, and he won\u2019t take no for an answer (I blame his parents for this). He will try again unless to put an end to it now.", "NTA\n\nYour daughter owes nothing to anyone. However, her comment was a bit much, but it was definitely out of frustration, and she herself is a child. I\u2019d say educate her on the proper way to communicate with people with autism. They\u2019re not always able to understand social cues, but that\u2019s definitely not an excuse. Yet, it\u2019s also very good that she\u2019s creating boundaries and not allowing others to walk all over her. Also, where were the teachers during all this? They should\u2019ve been the ones to sit him down and actually teach him how to handle rejection.", "NTA - I'm sure she tried to be nice to him the first time but it sounds like this is turning into harassment. Poor girl. She may have to report him to the school if he won't take no for an answer and leave her alone.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm kind of grossed out by how many comments are telling you that your daughter needs to be more polite with her language. Politeness is nice, of course, but not necessary when someone is crossing established boundaries.\n\nIt's maddening to think that it some places you'd be considered justified for shooting someone who broke into your home (crossed a boundary but didn't physically hurt you) but girls are not justified calling a boy names after he crossed her boundaries. \n\nAutism or not, the assholes in this situation are the ones teaching boys that they deserve politeness and kindness from girls, even if they're actively crossing their boundaries.", "The main lesson is that NO MEANS NO. When that doesn't work, then it's time to inflict a little pain.", "I\u2019m so glad you called to discuss your son\u2019s inappropriate behavior! I\u2019d like to hear what punishment you think is appropriate for sexually harassing my daughter?", "NTA. You could teach her substitutes for the word freak but like, it\u2019s not that big of a deal compared to the kid not leaving her alone.\n\nThe kid\u2019s mom really had the audacity to call you and say you\u2019re the AH? Call her back! Tell her to get her kid to leave yours the f alone and there won\u2019t be any more problems! Go to the school about it!", "NTA\n\nNo means no. If he didn\u2019t get the message delivered in a nice way, maybe he\u2019ll get it this time.", "NTA.  He may struggle with social cues, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t understand what no means.  And honestly, F politeness at this point.  Sometimes we have to blunt and your daughter shouldn\u2019t think she has to always \u201cbe nice.\u201d", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t need to learn \u201ctolerance\u201d for sexual harassment. You should tell everyone who calls you that they need to learn that \u201cno means no.\u201d The kid\u2019s mother especially needs to be told this.", "Nta. She felt harassed by him and retaliated.", "NTA. Either this child is taught to accept a no now or they are going to have a problem on their hands later. His disability doesn't make everyone responsible for him.\n\nAnd, since the parents seem to think your daughter is responsible for this situation, tell the school that either they keep him away from her or you are filing a restraining order.", "Might be an unpopular opinion, but if you are unable to understand the word \u201cno\u201d, then you are unfit to participate in society. \n\nI\u2019d have told that parent that if she can\u2019t educate her child to that most basic of standards, she needs to have him institutionalized. \n\nI\u2019m so sick of people using disabilities or illness to justify shitty behavior.\n\nNTA", " NTA. Unfortunately your daughter is already dealing with guys feeling entitled to her because they like her. So frustrating. I\u2019m not surprised she snapped as she was pushed to the edge and was being harassed.", "NTA. \n\nIf she did it once, and he kept pestering her, then I don't think she needs to be punished. \n\nI think its fine for you to talk to her about it.  But when someone keeps pushing past your boundaries, then sometimes their reactions won't be great.", "Nta, she said no multiple times. \n\nMaybe his parents should teach him how to not harass girls and take no for an answer", "NTA. I think the issue here is how loaded \u201cfreak\u201d can be with regards to neurodivergent people, but it\u2019s pretty clear that wasn\u2019t what your daughter meant and I\u2019d wager she\u2019d have used the word \u201cfreak\u201d whoever was harassing her. Kids don\u2019t have the biggest vocabulary for things like this and can\u2019t be expected to inherently know how their words might come across, especially when they\u2019re upset. The boys behaviour was not remotely okay and he *needs* to learn that he can\u2019t treat girls like this before it gets worse, being autistic doesn\u2019t make you unable to discern between right and wrong nor does it make it okay to overstep boundaries or forgo consent. \n\nI don\u2019t believe she needs to be punished or that either of you have done anything wrong, but the school and parents will only be hearing that she called an autistic boy a freak. They\u2019ll not be seeing the context, which is extremely important here. It might be worth explaining to your daughter that \u201cfreak\u201d wasn\u2019t the best word to use and then speaking with the school/parents about her intent and reasoning and *maybe* say something along the lines of \u201cwe are sorry for using that word, but not sorry for how she spoke to him, because the way he\u2019s been treating her is unacceptable and she had every right to stand up for herself\u201d \n\nBest of luck to you both.", "NTA while I don\u2019t like the word freak, this boy crossed a boundary and she was defending herself against unwanted attention", "i think those saying Y.T.A should read some of op\u2019s comments..", "NTA. Autism isn't an excuse to not take no for an answer. He needs to learn now before he's an adult and ends up with a record or a face full of pepper spray. His parents should have taught him that.", "NTA. I say that as a person with autism who was once a pretty girl in middle school and who dealt with similar bullshit. His autism isn't an excuse for his shitty behavior and pressuring your daughter. If he can't respect the word no, he doesn't then get to play the victim card. Encourage your daughter to continue shutting that crap down. People kept berating me to be nicer and it was incredibly damaging to me in the long term. She is allowed to say no and demand her answer be respected.", "NTA, but the autistic kid's parents sure are. They need to teach their kid that when someone says 'no' once, he shouldn't ask again. This isn't a pyramid scheme where you ask 7 times before accepting no as an answer.\n\nMy son (9) is autistic and I stay on him about social cues and consent. A lot of people think I am harsh, but the world does not give AF about somebody's disability. Also (as much as I love my son), autism is a very self centred disorder for high functioning people. I have to teach my kid to take other people's experience into perspective.", "NTA and I say this as an autistic person: sometimes we get too locked onto something and we need a harsh dose of reality to kind of reset. It's unpleasant and it feels bad but if he's not too autistic there's a good chance your daughter helped him by making his brain go \"okay that was unacceptable,  don't do exactly that again\"", "As the parent of an autistic son, NTA. Yes, sometimes autistic folks miss social cues, but if she was flat out saying no, there is no excuse. No one deserves to be harassed. \n\nAs for the \"freak\" statement - she was calling him a freak because he was harassing her, not because he's autistic, and tbh I'm not offended in the slightest. \n\nI hope someone calls my son out like this if necessary because neither him nor I want him to be allowed to cross boundaries because the other person isn't comfortable enough to be direct.", "NTA. I don't blame her for not wanting to be with the Autistic kid. My Fiance said yes when an autistic guy proposed to her and now he annoys her all the time \ud83d\ude02", "YWNBTA\n\nAs long as you step in an let your daughter know that name calling is never appropriate.  Praise her for her strength to stand up for herself.  Praise her for her previous handling of the situation.  But let her know that cracking and then engaging in base behavior, like name calling, is never appropriate.  That is allowing her to stoop to a lower level when it sounds like she is better than that.\n\nBesides, we all know how this stuff can be a slippery slope and, if she feels that she is justified in calling one kid a \"freak\", what will she do the next time she feels pressured?  What if the other student is black, or Asian, or Jewish, or some other minority?\n\nSo, I think this is a case where you just need to take the time to explain to her how you're proud at how she's handling the situation, proud how she's stood up for herself, but let her know that she always needs to keep her head in every situation... it will really benefit her in the long run.\n\nI also agree with u/litt3lli0n's comment.  I think this is well beyond the time for you to reach out to the school's Guidance Counsellor and request a mediated meeting between yourself and the boy's parents.  It doesn't need to be confrontational... just let them know that their son is of that age where he's starting to take notice of girls, and he's developed a childhood crush on your daughter.  Tell them that she has repeatedly and kindly tried to let him know she's not interested, but that he keeps pursuing her in a way that is making her very uncomfortable.  They should then be able to discuss this with their son, **and** you now have it on record with the school in case it does not stop so your daughter can go back to the Guidance Counsellor with complaints going forward.\n\nSo, just have that conversation with your daughter.  She's at a very impressionable age and praising her for all she did right, and gently letting her know what she did wrong will help nip that in the bud.", "NTA. Still calling people \"freak\" (and insulting people in general) should be avoided.", "NTA - It is on the parent\u2019s of the boy to help him understand social interactions and \u201cno means no.\u201d You\u2019re daughter has been dealing with unwanted attention and has every right to go off when it keeps happening and the school and parents don\u2019t take accountability and address the boys.", "NTA thank you for protecting your daughter", "NTA Your daughter doesn't owe politeness to the boy who is harassing her. You are doing a great jod standing up for her and not sweeping this under the rug like so many parents might have. Don't back down and don't apologize.", "NTA. He's harassing her at this point and this kid's parents are setting him up for failure by not teaching him boundaries. He's autistic, not stupid. They're doing him a massive disservice by not correcting his behavior. Soon he won't be a precocious teenager with a crush. He'll be a full blown adult who's never even told no or accepted boundaries from other people and that's incredibly dangerous.", "NtA how bout we stop having to punish young women for attitudes/kindness and instead we teach young men that no means no and how to deal with+ rejection.", "NTA\n\nThe mother needs to teach her son to accept rejection and boundaries. It\u2019s disgusting that they\u2019re putting the onus on your daughter. Yes, calling him a freak was uncalled for and rude, but she\u2019s said no nicely and politely four times previously. \n\nHis autism is not an excuse for shitty behaviour and him harassing your daughter and continuing to ask her out after being told no is shitty behaviour.", "NTA and I'm tired of the narrative that girls should be polite/proper with their words/actions. This has gone on long enough; the school did nothing about it and I'm sure the boys parents have/will do nothing about their son's actions so enough is enough! \n\nEveryone has their breaking point, children included.", "It's 2023, the era of preserving men's feelings after being told no is ending. Idgaf if he's autistic, that's not a blank check to trample on other women's boundaries. Little girls shouldn't have to martyr themselves to appease little boys. \n\nNTA", "NTA my daughter dealt with this and it can actually get quite scary quite young. No means no.", "NTA Make no mistake. **Your daughter was being sexually harassed** and the school failed to stop it.  the other child's mother is making allowances for her child but failing to understand what he is doing. She is doing him no favors by shielding him.", "Hell no. NTA. As someone with autism myself, you and your daughter are in the clear.", "NTA, and if you punish your kid for saying no, you risk encouraging her to be a doormat for future abusers to walk all over.\n\nHelp her practice saying, \"No means no!\" without the \"freak\" part.", "NTA.

Was she saying freak because is autistic, or was it just her saying stop being weird  as she would anyone else. I think the issue is the assumption of it being the boys autism, if it is that reason then your daughter needs to learn  you can't call people with differences that. If not and it was her not even realizing it then explain that to the parent. \n\nAs for the school, if they won't do anything about bullying go higher up or go online and call them out", "NTA, and awesome job empowering your daughter to advocate for herself.", "Good for you and your daughter. No one should have to put up with harassment autistic or not. Hurt feelings aren't the end of the world.", "NTA, in no universe should anyone be taught to \"tolerate\" harassment. Tolerance does not require accepting abuse or other poor treatment, including harassment).\n\nI would not punish my daughter and would in fact applaud her for being assertive.  I also would follow up with the school and ask what they are doing about the fact that she is being bullied and harassed for not reciprocating romantic overtures from boys.", "NTA.  Your daughter was being repeatedly harassed and the only way to stop it was to yell at him.\n\nWould it have been better to avoid the name-calling?  Sure, but it\u2019s a completely reasonable reaction to the harassment she was being exposed to.  Unfortunately, in this case it gave ammunition to the boy\u2019s enablers, but that still doesn\u2019t mean she was in the wrong.", "Sorry but being Autistic is no excuse. He has sexually harassed your daughter is now stalking her. Time for a stay away letter to the school and the parents and if that doesn\u2019t work? A protective order. His actions are completely unacceptable. If he keeps it up in the adult world he will be in trouble with the law so fast his head will spin. NO is a complete sentence", "A lot of moms are feminists until someone hurts their precious wittle boy. My mom is like this. Self proclaimed feminist,  supporter of equal rights and pay, etc., you don't owe any man your body.... Except somehow  all my brothers exes are evil selfish crazy sluts.", "I mean it's hard right? Is he a freak for being autistic? Absolutely not. But is it also extremely uncomfortable when someone can't take no for an answer? Absolutely. \n\nI think what would be best moving forward is to teach your daughter how to firmly do this without feeling the need to use harmful names/slurs.

NTA with a hint of poor parenting", "NTA Your daughter stood up for herself.  I wouldn't punish her but I would role-play some phrases to use when she wants to call someone out without name calling.

I had a similar situation when I was 7, a boy at school liked me and would not fucking back off no matter how many times I said I'm not interested.

He is autistic and I really thought it took him a while to understand due to that. Apparently not, he confessed to her at the picnic and she said no again. I was near by and went over to bail her out, he started trying to convince her to get to know him. My daughter snapped and told him to, \u201c leave me alone you freak, I told you so many times\u201d We soon left after that.\n\nI have been getting calls about teaching my daughter tolerance and that she needs to be punished for that.

Like, we can easily see the end result\u2026but getting there can get confusing, especially if some steps are dependent on completing an entirely different task.", "So, I can't say why.\n\nBasically, you have intrusive thoughts, right? Things that pop into your head. There's no reason. Just there.\n\nBut, for me, it's like 24/7 non-stop, 365, all the time.\n\nYou're in a crowded train station trying to focus on one conversation and there's 30 around you all at equal volume and you can't filter. You're watching one TV show and you want to focus, but someone else is flipping between two channels. You can't be fully present for one.\n\nThen, because you are so scattered everywhere, when people are talking, you just sometimes rush to the answer because you have the thought and it's there and you need to grab it and end up cutting people off a lot when talking.\n\nWhen trying to plan, you're focusing, and it takes a lot of mental energy. So, you're trying to plan out these details, and all the stuff just keeps coming in. It makes it hard to then plan out concise steps because you can't stop jumping to the end, the next project, dinner tonight, the dirty cup on your desk, the dog is licking his feet - is he licking too much and need to go to the vet? What hours is my vet open. Should check on that. Huh, I need to call when they're open. Maybe I should clean the coffee mug. Put dished into the kitchen. It's just... endless distractions, and they all exist inside my brain. It's very loud in here.\n\nIt's also sometimes hard to just sit. I pace, I fiddle, I wiggle, I stand up, I have awkward silent dance parties in my kitchen because... I can't not move. Still is unnatural. Movement is my natural state, and I don't know why. Still requires effort. Because still requires effort, that's more mental taxation that isn't on task-oriented things.\n\nEveryone else can have 15-minute blocks of time in a day and organize and lay them out and use each 15-minute block. My blocks get constantly thrown back out, and I spend a lot of mental time redoing it.\n\nNot every person with ADHD has the wiggles like I do. Some are just the inattentive part.\n\nThe inattentive part is where most of the executive dysfunction comes from. It's this constant bombardment of noise in my head. The hyperactivity part sometimes takes a mental energy toll, too.\n\nIt's was always really frustrating as a kid and young adult because my constant barrage of thoughts and everything was usually in my own head and nobody else was like that. Other times, I'd also be able to sit and hyperfocus on the weirdest stuff. Not like I couldn't focus. Why was I so bad at all of this?\n\nWell... the ADHD, mostly. Finally being on medication was like, oh my. You mean, I can slow down and do one thing and not five at once? What is this magic? It actually sort of slowed my roll. Helps when your brain isn't actively fighting against you.", "The executive dysfunction is caused by lack of oxygen.  I'm sure executive dysfunction is a symptom of thousands of diseases from autism to traumatic brain injury to schizophrenia to just being really tired.", "[deleted]", "This. I feel pretty confident she\u2019d have reacted the same way to an allistic boy behaving the same.", "I can speak and make eye contact. I'm considered high functioning. Others on the spectrum may have selective mutism and many struggle to make prolonged eye contact, but don't require support in their day-to-day or at work, but are considered low functioning. You commented 'IME' so I assumed you're autistic, or understood this.", "Because the terminology is inaccurate and causes harm when seeking treatment.", "But calling me high functioning means everyone assumes my support needs are zero.", "Thanks for helping me understand.", "No, it's also just normal women who are sick of our body parts being used as demeaning insults.\n\nThe other person is right, it's sexist language. If you're going to police a 12 year old's insults, you should at least have the basic decency to not recommend a term that's shitty to another demographic instead.", "My support needs and my functioning is in fact extremely variable.\n\nThere are days when I am a fully functioning got my shit together adult.  No one sees the days where I literally cannot do anything except stay in bed.  \n\nI have executive function deficits that have cost me hundreds or maybe thousands in inability to get my shit together and avoid charges and fines. \n\nIts insulting and hurtful to tell me I am high functioning.  \n\nMeanwhile someone with the spicy autism is being talked to like a child, amd having their preferences ignored or being given electric shocks for not complying with requests to stop stimming.\n\nLow function is used as an excuse to not bother considering people's wishes", "[deleted]"]}
