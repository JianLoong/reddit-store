But let me share why.\n\nI have been with my Husband for 16 years. We have gone through so much together, including 6 miscarriages. I've been able to carry to term once. The result was our beautiful and sweet girl who is now 7. I had 4 miscarriage before our daughter was born and 2 after. I've been so terrified that I'm going to have another. my husband didn't even know a I was pregnant for the last 2 miscarriages until after it happened. Ive been hiding it out of shame and fear. I remember the look in his eyes when I lost our babies. He wasn't angry but he was heart broken.\n\nso when I when I found out I was pregnant again I was of course scared. I didn't want to tell him until I was farther along. I was able to hide it well, it was winter so if my belly grew I was able to hide it with sweaters. I got lucky with the morning sickness. and my weight was also a helpful factor, I'm not obese but I don't exactly have washboard abs. I also don't drink often.\n\nwhen it came time to tell him I made an appointment to get an ultra sound first to make sure everything was ok and it was. Baby is healthy and strong. it was a huge weight off my shoulders so I knew it was time to tell him. When our daughter was over at a friends house I sat him down and I told him. He was over the moon and I could tell he was also disappointed that it took me so long to tell him, but he understood.\n\nHere is why I think I'm the asshole. I told my mom and she also was excited. but she started asking me why I didn't say anything sooner. I told her why and that I just told my husband too. then she asked for my husbands reaction. after that she started going off saying that he needed to know sooner so he could support me and that he's being a man and hiding how he really feels, and that I just caused more stress on everyone.\n\nNow she has me overthinking everything. So, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1680238518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127am8o/aita_for_not_telling_my_husband_i_was_pregnant/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's the one causing stress at this point\n\nEdit: congrats!! I was so mad at your mom I forgot to say it", "NTA \n\nYou should really have told him but you're really not TA. This is not an AITA question. \n\nYou have suffered the loss of your children and that brought a lot of pain. You did what you did for reasons. Reasons I don't necessarily agree with but reasons I can understand. Everybody mourns differently. This losses did someting to you and you were afraid. Fear does horrible and weird things to us. \n\nHe is your partner and the father. Of course he wanted to know. And he should've known. He is probably wondering if you do not trust him. And feels maybe a bit betrayed because even if you lost your other babies he certainly wanted to be part of these pregnancies. In good days and bad days.... You remember? \n\nMaybe you talk to him again and be honest why you did not want to tell him. \n\nApart from that gratulation and all the luck in the world for you and your family. From now on look forward to what is to come.", "NTA. \n\n>and that I just caused more stress on everyone\n\nNo one in this story, _no one_ is going through what you are going. Neither your mother nor your husband are having to physically experience the miscarriages.\n\nThere is no right way. I can't imagine what it must be like. \n\nDon't let anyone tell you what you should do regarding this matter. Do you what you think and feel right for you. Seeking therapy is always a good idea to help you sort out your feelings.", "NTA, your husband seems fine with it and understands. He can speak for himself and doesn't need your mom speaking for him. \n\nHowever I do think you might need to talk to someone about the fear you're having. Have you gone to therapy for the trauma the miscarriages gave you? The way you're talking about this and the fear and guilt you have seems like something you really, really need to sort through with a professional.\n\nSending lots of hugs and well wishes for you and your family.", "Your mum can\u2019t possibly know what your husband is feeling and sounds like she\u2019s projecting her own feelings. \n\nI understand your need to protect yourself and hoping to spare your husband pain, I also understand your husband being disappointed but you say he understood why.\n\nI don\u2019t think a judgment is appropriate here because you did what you felt was best. It probably would have been better to tell him earlier but you had good reason not to.", "I don't think anyone in your situation can be TA. You've been through several traumatic experiences regarding pregnancy. Sure, he's probably upset he didn't know sooner, but he knows now. Take that pressure off and try to enjoy your pregnancy with your husband. Many women with similar stories do the same thing because of the anxiety. Don't engage with anyone who has a negative or dramatic reaction as that will obviously not be good for you.", "NAH.\n\nI am gently going to say something that I have had to learn and am still learning: it's not loving to keep things from your partner just to save them from the emotion you're going through.\n\nI am the eldest child of a single parent who grew up in stressed circumstances. I learned very quickly not to burden her with my needs. In my (several decades-long) marriage this has manifested multiple times where I have not told him about bad things that had happened/were happening to me or our child because I didn't want him to worry. And because I thought it was my job to go through those things alone. \n\n\\[edited because I felt like I'd given too much detail before. Sorry\\]\n\nIn every one of those cases, what I deprived him of was the chance to show me how loving and supportive he is. Which he is! I deprived him of the choice to react in his own way. I deprived both of us of the ability to go through hard times together and come out stronger together.\n\nI completely understand where you were coming from, and you're no asshole. But it's ok to share your hurts and ask for comfort as well.", "A gentle, compassionate YTA. \n\nI get why you did it. Really, I do. But that is his child too- meaning the fear and potential loss are also *his* burdens to bear with you. Don't shut him out, and don't feel like you need to shoulder it alone. \n\nIf anything, the stress from keeping secrets and living in fear can't be good for a pregnancy. He has the right to know, and as a married couple, you two are a *team* fighting against life's challenges. \n\nAlso, I'm so sorry for your losses. And of course congratulations on your pregnancy.", "I just lost a seventh pregnancy. The last two times, I still told him within minutes of getting the positive result. For me, it\u2019s about being a team. The pregnancy is just as much his concern as it is mine. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but I think he deserved to know sooner. I hope it all goes well.", "NTA. Maybe you needed his support? Maybe you didn\u2019t need to carry someone else\u2019s fear on your shoulders too. There\u2019s no right answer other than what felt right to you to get by. And you did it. FIRM NTA", "NAH. \nYou were trying to protect her husband, and that is to be commended. I wish you both the best.", "I don\u2019t understand *how* you were able to hide your pregnancy from your husband. And I also don\u2019t understand *why* you wanted to hide it. Pregnancy isn\u2019t something that you hide from your partner. Understandable that you were scared about another miscarriage but your husband might be scared about your baby\u2019s and *your health. Your mum is right about keeping your partner and your family informed about it to get help and support. You dont need to go through it alone. You also need to understand miscarriages aren\u2019t a thing of shame. It\u2019s not *your* fault. It\u2019s a medical risk. If you\u2019re not seeing a therapist you need to, for your well-being.\n\nNAH.", "NTA (maybe NAH, if your mother wasn\u2019t overstepping or cruel). If your husband had been hurt by this, he is also not the asshole. \n\nYou waited because you have experienced real trauma. Your husband has too, though your body was far more intimate with that trauma than people seem to understand. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen someone yet for therapy about this and you can find time, I recommend you do so. Perhaps your husband would join you, and you can both better understand how your losses have affected you both. In the meantime, perhaps reassure your husband about his importance to you as your partner and ask him if he wants to talk about his feelings in this situation now that he has had more time. Work through this together. Be vulnerable. Congrats on your baby, OP!", "NTA - You and your husband are happy, everything else is water off a duck's back\n\nCongratulations!  :)", "This is just an unfortunate situation.  I understand your reluctance to say anything, you were protecting yourself and you had a valid reason. \n\nShould you have told your hubby, yeah, you probably should have.  He's your partner, the father of this child, and should have been the one you confide in.\n\nI'm gonna say NTA because you weren't trying to be mean but trying to keep yourself sane.", "NAH. He probably should have known. Not just as the father of an incoming baby, but as your partner to help and support you through the process however it turned out. But I also think from reading this that you might need therapy if you aren\u2019t going. Your wording and you keeping it from him sounds like you\u2019re blaming yourself for the miscarriages. They aren\u2019t your fault, YOU didn\u2019t lose the baby. It\u2019s something tragic that happened to the family unit, not something you did or failed to do. It\u2019s probably going to help having a new baby around, but just keep that in mind and seek help if you are having those thoughts or struggling.", "NTA. Your mom needs to butt out. Your husband is not upset and even if he were, it wouldn't matter because you're the one carrying this baby. \n\nCongratulations!", "Nta, \n\nOn a related note, is your mother a movie theatre? Cause she is projecting hard!", "NTA at all!! This is completely understandable, I can\u2019t even imagine how hard this must have been for you. You and your husband are both happy and don\u2019t stress yourself out, don\u2019t let anyone else do that either! I feel the disappointment is more in themselves rather than you if they\u2019re disappointed at all, because they may feel that they couldn\u2019t be the person you could rely on in your hardship you know? Self reflection! I think your mom feels that disappointment in herself and is projecting it onto your husband even if it isn\u2019t there.. anyways definitely NTA and so happy for you! Sending you my love!", "YTA. You denied your husband the opportunity to support you during those scary, uncertain months. My husband would be hurt if I excluded him in that way.", "NTA I get it, I lost my son at 17 weeks. The next (and final) pregnancy had me massively anxious, it was hard to \"enjoy it\" as everyone who wasn't me or my husband suggested. Your husband is happy, your mom's a huge AH though. HUGS", "NTA.\n\nAfter reading some of these responses I\u2019d be interested to see how many have ever been pregnant after a loss, let alone multiple.\n\nI had one and it nearly broke me. My husband was the most supportive person. He was devastated too when it happened and I wanted to bring him joy to tell him I was pregnant again, but also terrified it would end the same way. I considered waiting the 8 weeks until my first ultrasound to tell him, but ultimately waited 24 hours. If I had had multiple losses, I can 100% say I would have waited longer.\n\nEvery single day of that 2nd pregnancy was a mental battle which resulted in us telling no one until 2 months and our closest five friends at 4 months. Everyone else was told after 5 months. It wasn\u2019t for spite, or not caring about them, but about my own mental health as I was terrified every person I told the good news would just be another person I\u2019d have to let know when things didn\u2019t work out. People were understandably surprised and most handled it well\u2014several did not. Those people were more concerned about inquiring where they fell in the finding-out timeline, and feeling hurt, than for our well-being..and that is plain selfishness. \n\nYou said your husband was disappointed it took you so long, but understood. Of course he would be..after 16 years and multiple losses I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want you to have to bear this fear alone, but also knows all you two have experienced. He\u2019s a grown man and can verbalize his feelings if I am incorrect in that assessment. \n\nSeveral comments have recommended the therapy route. It\u2019s helpful to talk through this with someone other than your spouse after all that\u2019s happened, but it doesn\u2019t change what you went through or how that affects you in the moment. Your decision is understandable. \n\nYour mother is wrong. She is allowed to feel sad she didn\u2019t know until now. She is not allowed to project that onto you to criticise your actions. This is not her pregnancy..it\u2019s yours. I hope the rest of it  goes quickly and smoothly!", "YTA it's his kid too, he had a right to know", "NTA! 1000% over not the a hole. You were being so kind to take the stress, burden and worry on your own. I can\u2019t imagine how hard that was for you! I have a 4 month old and my god to go that far along with NO support because you were looking out for the emotional wellbeing of everyone else! You are amazing for that kindness you showed for your husband daughter and everyone else who cares for you. It is just the guilt of not knowing and not being there for you that is causing the reaction. You are 100% a strong amazing woman!", "YTA - saying that softly, he is the father he had a right to know. He is a grown man , you don\u2019t need to protect him, but you need to support each other.  Neither of you should stand alone", "NTA\n\nYour mom and husband are probably just reacting to the news but having the assorted feelings that they're happy for you but weren\u2019t granted the opportunity to support you during this stressful time, especially when husband could possibly see it as a view on him being seen as in able of supporting/comforting you at the time, whether true or not.\n\nBasically people have valid thoughts, you included, and everyone should just move on and focus on a healthy pregnancy.", "I was all set to say you are the arsehole when I read the title but having read your reasons you are definitely NTA. Losing so many babies is tragic and as a Dad who at one point thought he was losing a baby (wife started bleeding - baby was fine in the end) I can understand your fear and desperation to have this work out. \n\nCongratulations on the current pregnancy and I wish you and your husband good luck and a healthy child from the bottom of my heart.", "NTA. Your body is the one carrying this child and going through all the changes that come with it. Your body, your pregnancy, your decision on who knows and when they know.", "First of all, congratulations!  And good luck on a healthy and uneventful pregnancy!\n\nI think being frightened and a bit superstitious is entirely understandable given the circumstances, and frankly when you shared it with your husband and why is between you and him.

They should be able to communicate with each other. She robbed him of the beginning of the pregnancy to be able to help her and take care of her, plus she added extra stress on the pregnancy as well.
