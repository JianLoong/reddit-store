Our bedroom has an ensuite bathroom, my daughters room also has one and there's one downstairs. Just over a week ago we started renovating my daughters bedroom and bathroom, she's been staying in the guest room upstairs. But for some reason my wife told our daughter that she could use our bathroom when she's getting ready in the morning. I disagreed with this because I get ready at the same time as she does (I'm getting ready for work while she's getting ready for school) and I also need the bathroom. Despite daily flights I didn't back down and I'm still getting ready in my own bathroom but my daughter also refuses to use the downstairs one and she's been using ours at the same time. My wife keeps calling me a man child and immature and she claims I should just go downstairs every morning but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong.

Just over a week ago we started renovating my daughters bedroom and bathroom, she's been staying in the guest room upstairs. But for some reason my wife told our daughter that she could use our bathroom when she's getting ready in the morning. I disagreed with this because I get ready at the same time as she does (I'm getting ready for work while she's getting ready for school) and I also need the bathroom. Despite daily flights I didn't back down and I'm still getting ready in my own bathroom but my daughter also refuses to use the downstairs one and she's been using ours at the same time. My wife keeps calling me a man child and immature and she claims I should just go downstairs every morning but I don't feel like I'm in the wrong.

She should get out of his bathroom. She is acting like a spoiled brat! \n\nI\u2019m just saying the idea that people keep saying of, \u2018it\u2019s not ok for her to see him get ready for work\u2019, is ridiculous. It\u2019s fine, IF he is ok with it.\n\nOP is not, and that\u2019s fine. If he was ok with it, that would also be fine.", "Idk why people are arguing with you like this. It's not some outlandish statement, 3 bathrooms in one house, while very nice, is not some outlandish luxury unheard of to the masses.", "You make great points! For what it's worth, I wasn't arguing, just making an observation about something I think about a lot. :)\n\n(I also think it's super sweet you got your Gma's car. Those are the best kind of cars.)"]}
