This is about 3 of them Casey (26f), Alex (31nb) and Tom (34m). The names are not their true names.\n\nMy daughter Casey is getting married this winter to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27m)who she has been together with for about 4 years. I am covering the majority of the wedding expenses as Max's family lives in a different country and with the currency exchange rate they won't be able to afford the wedding and both to come to the wedding. I have no issues with it and just want my little girl to be happy.\n\nLast week while Casey was away, my children Alex and Tom came to visit with their families and we were talking about wedding invitations. I was surprised to hear that they haven't received their wedding invitations, so I just thought that Casey haven't sent them out yet for everyone, until my oldest and youngest daughter's pointed out they have received their invitations with their kids and partners invited. I called my sister who also said Casey has invited their whole family to the wedding too and she received hers a while back, so I immediately saw red. Both Alex and Tom have husbands and have children (adopted) and it seemed Casey has excluded them because of their choices. It also seemed weird since Casey has always been close to them and supported them when they came out as non binary and gay respectively.\n\nI have called Casey and demanded an explanation. My daughter said that Max and his family don't feel comfortable with couples that are not traditional and it goes against their culture and that she hopes for my understanding. I have told her if that's the case I will not be walking her down the isle and pull out from paying for her wedding, as she can not exclude her family like this when they did nothing wrong and if her future in laws opinion is so important to her, they can pay for the wedding. As a result Casey has called me an asshole and hanged up crying. My children are on my side, my wife is torn as she understands where Casey comes from but agrees she shouldn't have excluded her siblings like this.\n\nEdit: just want to add something about my wife. When I said she is torn and gets where Casey is coming from, it doesn't mean that she supports Casey's decision to exclude her siblings. She doesn't approve it in the slightest, however as a mother of our children she feels she should be there for all her children if they need her or want to talk, even if she doesn't agree with their choices. She is still deeply hurt by what Casey has said as she absolutely adores Alex's and Tom's husband's and their children.", "created_utc": 1689507877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15147bx/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_will_not_be/", "score": 13805, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is about 3 of them Casey (26f), Alex (31nb) and Tom (34m). The names are not their true names.\n\nMy daughter Casey is getting married this winter to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27m)who she has been together with for about 4 years. I am covering the majority of the wedding expenses as Max's family lives in a different country and with the currency exchange rate they won't be able to afford the wedding and both to come to the wedding. I have no issues with it and just want my little girl to be happy.\n\nLast week while Casey was away, my children Alex and Tom came to visit with their families and we were talking about wedding invitations. I was surprised to hear that they haven't received their wedding invitations, so I just thought that Casey haven't sent them out yet for everyone, until my oldest and youngest daughter's pointed out they have received their invitations with their kids and partners invited. I called my sister who also said Casey has invited their whole family to the wedding too and she received hers a while back, so I immediately saw red. Both Alex and Tom have husbands and have children (adopted) and it seemed Casey has excluded them because of their choices. It also seemed weird since Casey has always been close to them and supported them when they came out as non binary and gay respectively.\n\nI have called Casey and demanded an explanation. My daughter said that Max and his family don't feel comfortable with couples that are not traditional and it goes against their culture and that she hopes for my understanding. I have told her if that's the case I will not be walking her down the isle and pull out from paying for her wedding, as she can not exclude her family like this when they did nothing wrong and if her future in laws opinion is so important to her, they can pay for the wedding. As a result Casey has called me an asshole and hanged up crying. My children are on my side, my wife is torn as she understands where Casey comes from but agrees she shouldn't have excluded her siblings like this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Oh wow. You had me. I won't lie. You threw a curve ball in there.

No one likes being blindsided, especially when you assume that person likes you. She is completely wrong to shun her own family. That being said, many people here are saying his family are bigots. While that's how we see it here, people also need to understand that other cultures are very different. It's not bigotry from their perspective if it's part of their culture. Just like when the president of Iran said there are no homosexuals in his country, lol.   Bride should definitely have not given in. Maybe the grooms family said they wouldn't come otherwise. Who knows? She is not only throwing her brothers under the bus. She's a sneaky liar-by-omission. So, a generally shitty person all around", "Important note, Max is not comfortable either?

It's easy for us to say good riddance, but OP's fiance probably still loves his parents and other relatives.  They probably decided parents trump siblings if you're forced to make a choice, but didn't factor in all of her family backing her two non-traditional siblings.

Or is this truly just about placating the inlaws for the wedding. Does her fiance feel the same way? If so is she okay with him excluding her siblings from her for the rest of her life? Because that's what this boils down to. It won't be \"JUST\" for the wedding. It's gonna be Christmas. New years. Easter. Birthdays. Cookouts. If she intends to have children of her own this will effect them too. The family likely won't want \"the gays\" around her kids. Even if her husband doesn't outright say as much it could come in the form of always having a reason they can't attend X family function so as to not bring the kids around her siblings. \n\nNot to mention the kids themselves. They're to be raised with a family that supports and perpetuates bigotry. This was the fiance's and the daughter's chance to put their foot down and demand civility at LEAST if not outright cut off those who will be bad influences towards their future pairing. Does she want her kids to repeat the inlaws (and potential fiance's) view on gay relationships? What happens if her kids themselves are gay? Does she want to let them live potentially in self hatred for years because of what they were raised with, where the \"best\" case scenario is coming out anyways and being excluded from the family too if not out right cutting her off because she chose to support the inlaws bigotry over just.. letting people exist??\n\nWhat about the fact that she is alienating her entire family? Because while she's only intending to exclude two of them the others aren't going to let that slide (thankfully) just as you're not. If she's willing to exclude them now as I mentioned previously it won't end here. Every future event will be tinged with the idea that they don't want to be around the two siblings. Purely because of who they love. How awful. She's choosing to prioritize a family that would happily cut off their loved ones for loving who they love, rather than the family who would love unconditionally. She needs to know this will be the outcome. Not because you don't love her. But because you won't allow your children to be excluded over something so petty and miniscule. \n\nLet her know you'll always be there for her if she needs help, but you can't reward her for choosing people who wrongly hate her siblings over the siblings who have done nothing but love her.", "You are absolutely right in your choices and you\u2019d be harming your other children if you paid for her wedding that they were excluded from. \n\nI suggest that she either gets her head out of her ass and apologizes and makes genuine efforts to support all her siblings or she and her fianc\u00e9 can fly to his home country and let his family pay for the wedding which your family doesn\u2019t attend. And she can expect exclusion from your family events until she stops acting homophobic.", "They would have had more time to plan if they didn't try to brute force a sunken cost fallacy by being all sneaky about the lack of an invite.", "My sister is married to a woman and they adopted my niece. My sister is an amazing human and my bff. My niece invited her gay aunts and their daughter to her wedding and the grooms side made crude remarks but we just carried on. Sadly, that marriage was annulled because the groom decided he \u201cbats for the other team\u201d. My niece is ok and tbh she\u2019s living her best life and we\u2019re glad she found out before they had a family etc. It makes me worry for your daughter though. I see a red flag in this relationship with Max. \ud83d\udea9 If his family lives in another country then they most likely will have less interaction with them. Yet you said one sibling lives very close to Casey. What in the world is she thinking?! We can be siblings. Friends. Neighbors. But you can\u2019t come to my wedding but hey when we get back from our honeymoon let\u2019s have a Bbq?! Sorry to be sarcastic I can\u2019t get my head around this. I believe you\u2019re doing the right thing. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard but her behavior and her fianc\u00e9s isn\u2019t ok. It also makes me wonder why he hasn\u2019t tried to broker peace knowing the chaos this is causing his soon to be wife and future in-law  that live in the same country as him. And are paying for his wedding.", "Hell, anyone I\u2019m even mildly friendly with should be accepting of other people. I truly don\u2019t want to be friends with bigots, let alone date or marry them.", "Please understand: you\u2019re not a full person to me and I won\u2019t treat you with respect or affection?\n\n\u2026 no you WON\u2019T understand? Boohoo, so mean.", "Happy Cake Day!!!", "Happy Cake Day \ud83e\udd73!", "Happy cake day!", "Exactly! What if Casey's future kids, assuming she will get pregnant, turn out in a way her soon-to-be-husband and his family won't like? Will she then be turning against her own kids, too? OP, you might want to have a deeper talk with your daughter.", "I agree. I couldn\u2019t imagine sleeping next to someone like that.", "Exactly, I feel like there\u2019s very very few reasons for parents to ever cut their children off completely, and in this case it makes a lot of sense to not abandon this daughter to this clearly very controlling family. But I 100% agree with OP that it\u2019s his responsibility to not condone this mistreatment of his other children by funding or even attending this wedding. How terrible would that feel for your apparently supportive family members to all attend an event you were barred from because of their identities. Imagine if they hadn\u2019t been invited because they were adopted, or because they\u2019d chosen to marry partners of another ethnicity or something.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re a very kind and empathetic person, which is the furthest thing from boring in this world imo :)", "Happy cake day", "Wow this is by far the best comment I have read. I love it because it drives a point home without allowing for them to become defensive.", "Yeah, you don't need to be married or even in a relationship to have kids. That's a really bad decision, I hope she can get out and be ok. I truly don't understand people who are so desperate for any relationship that they will compromise themselves in major ways.", "NTA paradox of tolerance. It doesn't matter they are a different culture. They are being invited into yours and should therefore be tolerant of all as we are", "If you support her.. you shit on your other children. Someone is going to be hurt .. don\u2019t make it the victims of bigotry. She doesn\u2019t support their choices .. do you support hers? I\u2019d be much harsher on my own kid if they did this and be truly devastated they turned out to be this way. Stand your ground for the kids that deserve it .", "NTA. Sounds like future son-in-law might have some bigotry in him as well. Otherwise he could stand up to his family in support of his future wife.", "Religion isn\u2019t a an excuse for bigotry. Bigotry is not acceptable. Period. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that Casey has opted to be complicit in this situation but that\u2019s her choice.\n\nBy the way, being gay and/or non binary are not choices. I imagine your boys are very hurt.", "Agreed. Casey was suuuuper manipulative in the whole process. Lying, leading her family on, passive aggressively snubbing them, too cowardly to tell the all the truth up front bc she didn't want to face the backlash, ostracized her family then having the audacity to be upset when they find out the truth and threaten to ostracized her.. totally gross.", "Half the posts in here are titled for a Y T A but then the story flips it completely. I almost wanna say it's some intentional click bait shit but maybe I've just been on reddit too long", " Being able to understand someone\u2019s decisions or choices, does not mean excusing them. Empathy is not the same as agreement.", "then they can pay for the wedding.", "Also, it\u2019s not a choice. It\u2019s who they are. If someone is uncomfortable with them just existing, that\u2019s too bad for them.", "It's extra shitty she didn't bother to talk to them about it. When were they supposed to find out?", "I just wanted to say, I am sorry you are going through this and you did the right thing.", "Removing religion from the equation and approaching it purely logically, here\u2019s a way to approach it. Both families have traditions. Each are of the same value. Their family traditions involve excluding people that have lifestyles they don\u2019t agree with. Your family also has an equally valid tradition of including everyone, even if you don\u2019t personally have their same lifestyle. \n\nSo how do two traditions coexist? Removing religion from the equation, logically, the tradition that is more open must be the overriding tradition for this wedding event. Inviting  everyone and then allowing those that don\u2019t want to come for whatever reason is more fair and rational then not inviting select people who do want to come. \n\nInclusively inviting those who exclude works better than excluding those are inclusive.", "It'd be a hell of a party, too.", "Now I\u2019m invested! Please OP give an update! Did she change her mind or did you stand firm? \n\nNTA, btw her SO is already controlling things and she is going with it before marriage. What will he do once they are married? Best of luck.", "They don't approve of your kids' \"choices\"? Well then they can find out you don't approve of theirs when they get the bill.", "NTA \n\nI saw your edit and while I totally understand your wife wants to be there and be supportive of all of her children, she needs to stop that. When one child is wrong, you tell them bluntly and directly with zero sympathy for hurting their sibling. Some behavior is off limits and you and your wife need to realize that. \n\nThe fact that your wife is so understanding, may be why Casey thought she could get away with this. Being a good parent is telling your kid to \u201cknock that shit off right now\u201d sometimes.", "I would put it like that to her \u201chow do I tell my child that I paid for and am supporting an event that they and their partner are not welcome to\u201d. She can choose to risk her relationship with her family for the sake of her new one but she cannot expect you to. NTA", "I love that the fam is good enough for when the bill comes, though.", "NTA. If they\u2019re so uncomfortable they can pay for the whole wedding.", "NTA. The way I see it, there are two issues. Your daughter is discriminating against your other children. Your knee jerk reaction is right here. But I also think this may be evidence that your daughter is marrying an abusive man. By convincing her to choose between him and her family he is isolating her from her support system.", "I\u2019m thinking that a lot of it is probably because she is worried about Casey. She knows where her other two kids are, their relationships are healthy enough that they are bringing their families over to all hang out together.\n\n\nIt can be really hard to navigate something like this in a way that doesn\u2019t isolate the person with a problematic partner from the rest of the family. Once they are isolated their partner and partners family are the main influence in their life. If the daughter feels like every bridge home has been burned it also makes it much harder for her to leave if she wants to.\n\n\nI think that the family needs to communicate and make a plan together. What she is doing is unacceptable, but they also probably don\u2019t want to lose their daughter and sister to hateful people.\n\n\nIt\u2019s usually best to make sure that the person knows that you love and support them, but you can\u2019t support the beliefs that they are allowing or the people that they are choosing to be with. Asking questions and encouraging them to ask questions about the beliefs and what is going on.", "This is mu thought, if this is really out if character for her it may be an abusive relationship. Stick by your decision, it\u2019s absolutely the right one, but I think you may also need to be her lifeline if the relationship becomes controlling and dangerous.", "Is this for real? The orphan thing?", "No, it's an old joke to explain the meaning of the word \"chutzpah.\""]}
