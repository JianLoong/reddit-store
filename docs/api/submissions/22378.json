This is about 3 of them Casey (26f), Alex (31nb) and Tom (34m). The names are not their true names.\n\nMy daughter Casey is getting married this winter to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27m)who she has been together with for about 4 years. I am covering the majority of the wedding expenses as Max's family lives in a different country and with the currency exchange rate they won't be able to afford the wedding and both to come to the wedding. I have no issues with it and just want my little girl to be happy.\n\nLast week while Casey was away, my children Alex and Tom came to visit with their families and we were talking about wedding invitations. I was surprised to hear that they haven't received their wedding invitations, so I just thought that Casey haven't sent them out yet for everyone, until my oldest and youngest daughter's pointed out they have received their invitations with their kids and partners invited. I called my sister who also said Casey has invited their whole family to the wedding too and she received hers a while back, so I immediately saw red. Both Alex and Tom have husbands and have children (adopted) and it seemed Casey has excluded them because of their choices. It also seemed weird since Casey has always been close to them and supported them when they came out as non binary and gay respectively.\n\nI have called Casey and demanded an explanation. My daughter said that Max and his family don't feel comfortable with couples that are not traditional and it goes against their culture and that she hopes for my understanding. I have told her if that's the case I will not be walking her down the isle and pull out from paying for her wedding, as she can not exclude her family like this when they did nothing wrong and if her future in laws opinion is so important to her, they can pay for the wedding. As a result Casey has called me an asshole and hanged up crying. My children are on my side, my wife is torn as she understands where Casey comes from but agrees she shouldn't have excluded her siblings like this.\n\nEdit: just want to add something about my wife. When I said she is torn and gets where Casey is coming from, it doesn't mean that she supports Casey's decision to exclude her siblings. She doesn't approve it in the slightest, however as a mother of our children she feels she should be there for all her children if they need her or want to talk, even if she doesn't agree with their choices. She is still deeply hurt by what Casey has said as she absolutely adores Alex's and Tom's husband's and their children.", "created_utc": 1689507877, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15147bx/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_will_not_be/", "score": 1141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is about 3 of them Casey (26f), Alex (31nb) and Tom (34m). The names are not their true names.\n\nMy daughter Casey is getting married this winter to her fianc\u00e9 Max (27m)who she has been together with for about 4 years. I am covering the majority of the wedding expenses as Max's family lives in a different country and with the currency exchange rate they won't be able to afford the wedding and both to come to the wedding. I have no issues with it and just want my little girl to be happy.\n\nLast week while Casey was away, my children Alex and Tom came to visit with their families and we were talking about wedding invitations. I was surprised to hear that they haven't received their wedding invitations, so I just thought that Casey haven't sent them out yet for everyone, until my oldest and youngest daughter's pointed out they have received their invitations with their kids and partners invited. I called my sister who also said Casey has invited their whole family to the wedding too and she received hers a while back, so I immediately saw red. Both Alex and Tom have husbands and have children (adopted) and it seemed Casey has excluded them because of their choices. It also seemed weird since Casey has always been close to them and supported them when they came out as non binary and gay respectively.\n\nI have called Casey and demanded an explanation. My daughter said that Max and his family don't feel comfortable with couples that are not traditional and it goes against their culture and that she hopes for my understanding. I have told her if that's the case I will not be walking her down the isle and pull out from paying for her wedding, as she can not exclude her family like this when they did nothing wrong and if her future in laws opinion is so important to her, they can pay for the wedding. As a result Casey has called me an asshole and hanged up crying. My children are on my side, my wife is torn as she understands where Casey comes from but agrees she shouldn't have excluded her siblings like this.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No one likes being blindsided, especially when you assume that person likes you. She is completely wrong to shun her own family. That being said, many people here are saying his family are bigots. While that's how we see it here, people also need to understand that other cultures are very different. It's not bigotry from their perspective if it's part of their culture. Just like when the president of Iran said there are no homosexuals in his country, lol.   Bride should definitely have not given in. Maybe the grooms family said they wouldn't come otherwise.

Is she now just throwing away her ideals and moral compass to fit in with bigotry? These questions need answered so family can make a choice as to rather or not they want to support this marriage.", "Sorry, did you somehow just compare excluding family in favor of bigots and wearing uncomfortable clothes? Friend, if your wife is empathizing, it\u2019s because she\u2019s okay on some level with what they\u2019re doing.", "There's two things your daughter can do : stick with family and break up with the other bigot.", "NTA. Do not pay for a wedding that fly's in the face of who you are.  It is your money and if you thought of leaving any money to your kids their future money.  I would not pay for ANY THING for a human that is racially, ethnically, religious and/or sexually discriminatory.  If you maintain contact with her I suggest light bites and coffee at a local coffee shop that is owned by either Brown, Black,Asian, or LGBTQ+ owned/run.  I hope your daughter sees the light and I would still leave open communication with her not the human she is marrying.  I hear what your wife is saying and I am sure her brothers and sisters.  There is no reason the rest of the family cannot attend though and should not be a burden on to them if they feel torn.  You should make that clear.", "That sounds reasonable until you think about the future. Is she going to ostracize her siblings to avoid fights with these people for the rest of her life?", "Not sure when OPs kids came out with Caseys help, but I would guess it was before her relationship. And a 4 year long relationship is long enough to manipulate someone. Especially if it is the SO. \n\nIt starts with small comments like \"Can we sit out this bbq? I don't feel good.\" or \"There sure is a difference in our familys.\"\n\nAnd then it just goes of deeper. Making worse comments and witholding affection as \"punishment\" if the partner does not agree. \n\nThat is not to say that Casey is not guilty in away. She should have pushed back from the beginning. But given the stark change in character there seems to be more at play here.", "Maybe she doesn\u2019t understand that accepting bigotry in your loved ones makes you a bigot, too.", "I have a friend who did this. They are on the verge of divorce and have been their entire relationship. But my friend, stupidly and desperately, wanted kids. They also have always had incredibly low self esteem and felt like if they didn't get married then, they wouldn't have a chance in the future. Which is the farthest thing from the truth.", "There is a really weird thing with white liberal women dating/marrying men from \u201cmarginalized groups\u201d despite the fact that those groups tend to be far more socially conservative than white people.", "I think that might include the groom."]}
