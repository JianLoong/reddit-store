Still, you did also have the right to celebrate after. It is possible for someone in a relationship to have a good day and the other to have a bad one and both exist at the same time.

This is a tremendous burden on your girlfriend and doesn't typically go with the typical 9-5 job.  You have the right to be disappointed but you handled it wrong which makes you the AH.  One thing you can do is to come to an agreement that each one has 5 minutes (time can be determined) to vent or do whatever once they get home to get it out of the system.

Believe me it\u2019s depressing when someone comes home all the time with negativity and you don\u2019t even get to celebrate your special day because they make it about them first. Their feelings aren\u2019t the only ones that matter. There are two people in this situation not just one. There is a time and place to vent. It shouldn\u2019t just be about her feelings all the time.", "Yes. \n\nI understand that. \n\nWalking through the front door in a bad mood is never a good look, and if the first face to face communication you have with someone after several hours of being apart is what went wrong with your day\u2026\n\nIt doesn\u2019t take many times for this to cause anxiety and even dread.", "Doing a quick \u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d over the phone is not a celebration.", "Nowhere does he say she comes home venting often or everyday or even that she has ever come home venting before", "Exactly! It\u2019s great that he supports her partner on her bad days but it doesn\u2019t make him a bad person for wanting at least one day to be about him too!", "We were talking about support, not celebration.", "Reread the post\u2026. yes he did.", "It started with celebration. He can support her after they celebrate. Why is the fianc\u00e9\u2019s day more important than his?", "He says \u201cThis kind of thing is very normal\u201d but it\u2019s clear whether he\u2019s referring to the things she experienced, her coming home having had a bad day, her venting, or her coming home and venting right away.", "Some of you people don\u2019t have empathy and it shows.  We don\u2019t even know what her bad day is about and you are just saying she should essentially get over it the second she walks through the door. Did a child die? Did she see one covered head to two in bruises? Those are some very really possibilities in her line of work. Like\u2026sure honey\u2026let\u2019s pop the champagne while these traumatic images flash in my head.", "If she didn\u2019t vent how would he know how she felt about her job on a \u201cnormal basis\u201d. You proved my point.", "Also, I maintained that of course both partners feeling and emotions should always be heard but there is a time and place for them. It is not when your partner has a special event and wants to celebrate. Maybe it\u2019s later in the evening but not in their moment."]}
