You save a bag for next week. Or you pay whatever the extra bag fee is. Neighbor had **no way** of knowing if you planned to place additional bags out before pickup time \u2014 all they cared about was themselves.", "NTA. \n\nYeah it wouldn\u2019t have effected you to let the trash bag stay on your curb but that doesn\u2019t make it any less annoying. I feel like that\u2019s just poor manners. It\u2019s not your job to help your neighbors avoid an extra charge.  They literally could have asked.", "YTA. Save your energy for issues actually worth worrying over", "NTA It's their garbage, period.\n\nAnd I can't believe people here saying you are, etc. Condoning a town policy break...", "ESH , it would\u2019ve been polite of them to ask first yes . But as long as they never do it when you have already reached your 3 bag limit to tip you over what difference does it make? As you only had one & it would make no difference ,it was petty to put it back . Maybe next time you see them just say oh I saw you added a bag to my rubbish (so they know you\u2019ve noticed ) , that\u2019s fine as long as I\u2019ve less than 3 & right before collection ( incase you have more of your own to add ) .   I\u2019ve told my neighbours if my bins aren\u2019t full just before collection they can add some to mine if they\u2019ve run out of room , there\u2019s only two of us in my house & more people in theirs . \nNot much point falling out with a neighbour over something so minor you never know when you might need a favour .", "NTA. They didn't ask or even mention it and I wouldn't want to set the precedent that it's okay in case they started doing it all the time", "ESH. Should they have asked first? Yes. But like your SO said, that extra bag of trash had \\*zero\\* impact on you whatsoever. The thing to do would have been to talk to them after the trash collection and say \"hey, please talk to us next time\".", " NTA. Their garbage, their problem.", "NTA.\nSounds like if they take three for free, you probably have to pay for more, or they won't take it.\nYou're well within your rights to do that, it was disrespectful of them to do that in the first place, especially if you do get charged for extra bags, and hopefully this will teach them a lesson not to try and pull that shit again. Sounds like they didn't want to pay for or deal with their extra trash. Not cool for them to try and dump it on someone else.", "Nta\n\nLike you said, it's different if they had asked. One more time and they'll either start asking, or just not doing it. \n\nI'm assuming they are neighbors that you don't really talk to anyway, or this prly wouldn't even have been posted, so best not to do this if you want to have a good relationship with them.", "YTA it doesn\u2019t affect you in any way. If you needed to put more trash out then moving it back would make sense.

That WAS petty\u2026how did it harm you to have it sitting out there?", "YTA It's garbage, why do you care? You said you only put one bag on the curb and, let's be honest, it's unlikely you would suddenly have two more to put out in the morning. This doesn't affect you at all, and that little bit of money saved might make a big difference to them, especially these days with the cost of living being what it is. Sure, it might've been nice to be asked but maybe they didn't want to knock on your door in the middle of the night when they put out their trash? They probably noticed that you only had the one bag and didn't think it was a big deal? Because it's not?", "YTA.. God for bid your can is ever to full for that last sack.", "ESH. Like you said, it didn't impact you at all. So doing that was a petty move. But neighbors like that suck too.", "ESH. What they are doing doesn\u2019t affect you at all. You were being petty because you were in a bad mood. They should be asking you though instead of letting it be a surprise.", "YTA, If you don't already have three what's the difference?  Do you really think knocking on your door early in the morning to ask permission is required?  In my neighborhood it is pretty common to drop an extra bag here and there if you have more than normal and the neighbors have less than the max.  Exactly why is this something to get upset about other than just looking for something to be upset about?", "ESH \n\nThey shouldn't have done it but you were petty in return.", "YTA", "If it doesn't affect you so not sure why you actually care. I assume it was in a bag that had no holes where garbage was falling out to make a mess. He didn't leave it in front of your house days before. Garbage man will pick it up soon with yours. This really isn't the hill to die on, as there are a lot of annoying or serious issues that can ruin neighbors. Better to ignore this one. Of course it would be courteous if they have asked you. ESH", "YTA. I\u2019m really struggling to see what the harm was, like at all.", "ESH - They\u2019re AHs for pitting the trash in front of someone else\u2019s houses.  The city sucks for not picking up all the trash (this sounds like a very bad idea).
