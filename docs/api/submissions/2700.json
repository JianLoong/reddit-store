It's just ridiculous to be this petty about it.\n\nHonestly it's a crappy rule anyway, people have different sized families and different needs. 3 trash bags is what my family of 3 produces weekly and we recycle heavily and even compost, but my daughter has high medical needs and produces a ton of trash all by herself because we have lots of non-recyclable medical supplies and diapers. Just one week's worth of adult diapers fills a trash bag and then some for her, they actually take up a very significant amount of space. If we have another kid we'll definitely be over 3 bags.", "Maybe OP would take all their trash out at the same time in the future, seems like a minor change to avoid any issues.  Not sure why everyone assumes the neighbor is a dick who isn't mindful of causing charges to other people.  They probably wouldn't have put it out if op had had three bags.  Hell sometimes I grab my neighbors' extra trash if mine isn't full, it's about minimizing charges for everyone, not hoarding bin space I'm not using.  It's called being neighborly.", "How sad and little life to get this worked up by something that does r affect you at all. To demand to be asked about a rubbish bag once in a public space.", "YTA. It costs you nothing to be kind and understanding. But you seem selfish, so I\u2019ll explain it to you in a way you can understand: if your neighbors\u2019 trash piles up and you live next to them, isn\u2019t that going to be an issue for the cleanliness and appearance of your home as well? \n\nThis isn\u2019t something anyone should have to ask permission for. You\u2019re not using the space\u2014why can\u2019t they have it?", "YTA. Really? It\u2019s garbage and it doesn\u2019t affect you. This is how you spend your time?", "I don\u2019t care what happens as long as my trash gets taken. Not sure what the big deal is, even reading all the comments. Trash removal is a service and having it removed helps the whole neighborhood. I live in an apartment building and the trash is communal, but when we lived in a street with houses, I would not have cared. I am not going to judge because clearly I am missing some of the intricacies of being neurotypical.", "YTA, just have a conversation with them and ask them not to do it again. Leaving it wouldn't have caused you any harm its just petty.", "YTA  It's just rubbish, you're getting all bent out of shape over rubbish.  Would you prefer it to get blown all over the street.  Your neighbours waited and saw who didn't use the all the free spots and put their extra with yours.  Your ego needs a trim, they're not trying to take over your property or cause you any grief.  It's just petty.", "ESH. \n\nYes it would have nice for them to ask and they shouldn\u2019t have done it but is it really impacting you that much? No. \nIt\u2019s not really a hill worth dying on", "NTA", "NTA, the neighbor need to quit generating so much garbage.", "NTA\n\nBut you also just seem like the worst neighbor ever. An extra bag of trash is really worth this? You literally won\u2019t even touch it, sounds like you just suck as a neighbor", "YTA \n\nWe had noticed our neighbor didn't get their bags out in time last pick up. This pick up we actually made an effort to only put one bag out instead of spreading it over two (ours is a two bag pick up), and low and behold our neighbours did in fact take advantage.\n\nIt didn't cost anything for us to help out. I'm sure one week we may have too many bags and would appreciate decent neighbors.\n\nA little bit of kindness goes a long way, and you never know when karma means you'll need a favour from them one day.", "You know who is the real AH in this situation is? Your local government. Why are you being charged for waste collection? Isn't that what your taxes are for?", "What would have happened if OP had a second and third bag that they just have not put out, yet? Then they have to deal with this BS.", "Neurodivergent here too and I really don't understand this either.\n\nApparently being a decent neighbor isn't a thing?", "Depends, if there are a lot of people living in that house they might not be able to cut down.  I'm in that situation, I'm paying for the largest bin we're allowed and sometimes still have an extra bag.  But my neighbors and I coordinate and share bin space when needed instead of all this passive aggressive stuff xD.", "Bc OP is (forced to be) giving up part of his allowance for the neighbor. Without getting anything in return. That's a favor in my book.", "Right? I'm not necessarily sure Im comfortable calling OP an asshole for it but Jesus are they petty af", "General swearing doesn't seem to get people in too much trouble I've noticed. Insulting OP, the person OP is talking about or other commenters seems to be the thing that gets them in trouble :)", "So your neighbor did something antisocial and you decided to poison his dogs in retaliation?", "What ruins societies is breaking policies and laws. Exactly what you seem to like so much.", "This, I wish it were based on household size with allowances for stuff like that.  Our city has 3 different bin sizes we can choose from but we already have the largest one (holds 4 bags).  We normally generate 3 bags for 4 adults, but two of those 4 struggle with depression so periodically they'll have an extra 2 bags in a week when they have a post depression cleanup.  Then I have to figure out where to stash the extra bags, hoping one of the other people didn't have an extra bag the same week, etc.  Fortunately one of our neighbors usually has half their bin empty and lets us use it, while I let another neighbor use our yard bin since I compost most of that.  Worst comes to worst I just hold a bag until the following week.  Would be so much nicer to not have to deal with all that effort. It was never a problem in the previous city I lived in because the bins were larger.", "You seriously think this dude having two bags instead of one out screws with the city's budget? If they say 3 bags per house then their budget needs to allow for 3 bags per house. If it doesn't then they've done their budget wrong and that's not OP or his neighbors problem.", "The problem is that it could cost the op money. Especially if the neighbor makes it a habit.", "Our trash company provided a bin for us, it's pretty big and I can really cram a 4th bag into it when I need to. We don't have a bag limit, just has to fit the bin with the lid closed, can't be overflowing. So far I haven't had to go over that and my neighbors have much bigger families than me so I don't think I could reasonably use theirs, though I know they'd be cool with it if they had space. I suppose I'd probably just have to stash a bag of diapers out in the shed for an extra week and apologize to the squirrels that live nearby for the gawdawful smell.", "It didn\u2019t and they haven\u2019t.", "Lol... Either doesnt own property, litters all the time. Or hey maybe person is filthy rich, owns acres of land.  Lets make an extra effort to dump on their space.  Or city space near their place.", "Not yet.", "Ah, yes. Always best to think the worst of people! That\u2019s what makes life worth living!", "For my part, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve spent half a day posting about a bag of garbage!"]}
