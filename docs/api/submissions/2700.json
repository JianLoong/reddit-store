Why does this fact upset you when it comes to trash collection?\n\n>and poor people have to beg\n\nYou have an absurd view on begging. They could say something like **\u201chey, I have noticed that you often have space left in your trash can. If we once in a while have an extra bag, would you mind if we would put it in your can, assuming it\u2019s not full and that it\u2019s close to collection time?\u201d**.  That would not be begging.
