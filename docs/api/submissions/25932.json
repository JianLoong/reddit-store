If you refer to someone as a Jew in a context where it shouldn't matter, it's likely to be intended as an insult.\n\nOne data point (which of course doesn't prove anything): A Hasidic Jew once asked me \"Are you a Jew?\". It was perfectly appropriate in context. (And the answer was no.)\n\nThe fact that antisemites often use \"Jew\" as an insult has led to a tendency to use circumlocutions like \"Jewish person\". That's not entirely a bad thing, but it's probably unnecessary.

However, from your own research it does appear that at least some portions of the population do feel like it is derogatory.\n\nThis may not be a good example - I've never even met a Jewish person where I live - but the situation does seem similar to my own group, Australian Aboriginies and the use of the term \"Abo\". Abo isn't necessarily offensive - like Jew is an abbreviation - but it is often used in an offensive manner and some ppl within the community are very offended when hearing it. I'm personally not offended but I do understand the perspective of those that are, the word has been used to demean our ppl and even if you personally don't mean it in a demeaning way doesn't mean the other person won't feel just as demeaned as if it had I'll intention. Therefore, I don't personally use terms that have been used to demean a culture or ethnicity once I'm informed that this is how they have been used.\n\nI guess the question you need to ask yourself is if you say this and unknowingly it comes to the attention of a Jewish person how finds it offensive will you still feel in the right?", "NTA.
