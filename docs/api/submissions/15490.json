If she won't stand up for you and also doesn't want you to stand up for yourself to racist pricks, maybe time to reconsider if she's right for you", "NTA - but she is. The idea that she doesn\u2019t care what he says or does and just wants you to obey him shows how deep that abuse runs and you don\u2019t have to be a part of it.", "NTA\n\nIts never ok to have to be nice to someone abusing you, or being racist. Talk with the GF and try to figure it out. If she insists and gets angry, find someone who appreciates you OP.", "NTA and that's a pretty big red flag from your GF. I can't just imagine what life would be like if you to get more serious. I imagine family holidays would be fantastic. \n\nShe may be a lovely girl, but you don't have to like not associate with her father.", "She doesn't love you, man. You're just a badge. Get out of there.", "Easiest NTA of all time. Consider whether you want to stay with someone who won\u2019t back you against a racist, particularly if it\u2019s her own family.", "NTA.  You\u2019re doing the right thing standing up to the asshole.  Don\u2019t pick a fight of course and if he can manage to get through the occasion without being offensive or horrible then great but that sounds unlikely. You have no obligation to put up with racism especially given your background.\n\nIt\u2019s not right for her to expect this of you.  It\u2019s asking too much and not showing that she supports you.  And no one ever has a right to violence against another person except in self defense.", "Just break up lol", "OP you said she flipped out on you by saying you don't have a choice by standing up for yourself.  From your posting you were raised to hold yourself higher than that, so if she wants to date someone who's insecure and unwilling to acknowledge his heritage, then wish her the best of luck.  You deserve to be with someone you don't need to make excuses for as to why they don't have any respect for you.", "So, to summerize, you're ok dating a racist?", "A lot of posts from people complaining about their racist partners. Something in the water?\n\nJust stop dating racists everybody!", "NTA.

Nobody needs racists and abusers. You need to understand, though, that it is important for your GF that you somehow \"get along\" with her family. I guess she has long term plans and those won't work out if you were on hostile terms with her family. Not an easy task at hand.", "Your GF's position regarding her racist father is not the kind of foundation you need in order to have a good, solid relationship and life together.

Her trying to force you to get along with her shitty dad is also shitty on her part. \n\nShe also blatantly told you that she didn\u2019t gaf if he called you out of your name, racist or not.

At that point you should break up with her. If she can't stand up towards her parents for the person she loves, she doesn't really love you to begin with. \n\nThat's my opinion on it. But as I said, give it a try first.", "She doesn\u2019t care what he says or does and you just have to get along with him? Absolutely not. Please exit this relationship ASAP. NTA.", "NTA.

Don\u2019t ever date anyone who can\u2019t stick up for you when someone else is clearly in the wrong.", "It just blows my mind because when people in my family had something to say about her being white, I stood up for her and told them accept it and give her respect or keep their nose out of it and keep away from her.", "She\u2019s always been very against her father and expressed all the time how she just wanted to get away from him, and that she didn\u2019t like how he was. I guess that was all just bs to make me happy? It\u2019s not just the racism but the abuse too.", "People who endured abuse often internalise abusive behavior to survive. They need to understand their abuser to survive and I guess she knows fully well, that she can't expect her dad to act civilized towards you. \n\nPlus maybe her dad expects to be introduced (cause people like that function on empty customs since they lack real values) and she can't stand up to that.\n\nPoint is you can't expect fully normal, healthy behavior from her. But you can expect her to accept your boundaries and trying to introspect on her fucked up relationship with her dad instead of pulling you into their mess. Managing a relationship with someone who endured abuse isn't easy. You can try to understand her, but you don't have to be like her.", "So your family are racist too?  Sounds like ESH.", "You may like this girl, but it's only been 6 months, get out of there as quickly as you can. You don't need this man (or his enabling daughter) in your life; it's time to punt and move to greener pastures.", "She might be too scared of him to stand up to him, and telling you to back off and accept it is her risking anger from someone she knows is safe (you) rather than risking anger from someone who is known to be dangerous. Which is zero excuse and you absolutely shouldn't take it, do you see you spending the rest of your life walking on eggshells like this?", "People in abusive relationships - esp. with their parents can have super effed up ideas about what relationships should look like. Or will be triggered about the weirdest things. Maybe she knows fully well that her dad will try to provoke you and doesn't want to get caught inbetween, while also fully believing that you \"have\" to meet her dad. I think anyone in that situation needs therapy at some point.\n\nWhatever it is, I'd advise you to tell her that it's up to her how she wants to proceed about this issue but \"making nice even if your dad treats me like shit\" isn't an option.", "\u2026OP literally stood up for her against his family?? what are you talking about???", "Some white people love jumping at the chance to call non whites racists, it's like they think they have their gotcha moment.

Clearly she\u2019s not racist. You think behind closed doors her dad hasn\u2019t expressed his disgust and she hasn\u2019t defended her boyfriend to him? How\u2019s this different when both families are racist?", "Pure assumption then?", "That\u2019s a leap, he told them to shut up and keep their noses out if they can\u2019t respect her.

Are you trying to say she has defended him, or she has not defended him?", "Yes, tbh it's not fair of me to make a comment about your skin color. I'm just sick of seeing obviously white people go - HA racism!\n\nEdit: and I'm saying this because most Caucasians don't really experience what it's like to be discriminated against for skin color and I can fully understand why some minority groups might be cautious about their kids dating someone from a group that often treats them poorly.", "It\u2019s not a leap, it\u2019s literally exactly what he said in the comment we are replying to.  Some of his family may have chosen to keep their noses out, and some may have decided to accept it and give her respect (which in reality means suck it up and shut up, not actually accept it and respect her).  So the latter category, they\u2019re still racist. It\u2019s not a leap to assume she has to spend time around those people.", "I mean, it\u2019s LITERALLY a leap. As in, you don\u2019t have that information and are LEAPING to your own conclusions based on assumptions. \n\nI cannot say it any clearer."]}
