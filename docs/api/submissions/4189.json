Also, this is a very short version of events because of the character limit.\n\nI (24 M) have been dating Anna (22 F) for four years. We moved in together last year. Anna is a big soccer fan and asked if we could convince my mom to let us host thanksgiving this year because Portugal was playing, and she wanted to watch, and my mom is the \"no electronics allowed on Thanksgiving\" type of person. I warned her that she knows my mom is picky, and she promised she would make traditional thanksgiving food alongside the Portuguese food (she wanted traditional food because she was missing home a lot more this year). So I relented and convinced my mom because I wanted Anna to be happy.\n\nAnna cooked all week (she is seriously one of the best cooks of all time). She made a big spread of Portuguese food like codfish, green soup, roasted pig, chorizo (her grandma makes it herself it's the most delicious thing in the world), cheese, etc., and all the typical American food spread like turkey, gravy, etc. My mom, dad, cousins, and grandparents came over. Annas mom, dad, two brothers, and grandma are the only ones that could make it for obvious reasons. I could tell my mom was already displeased about the TV being on, especially because of how loud Annas family gets over soccer.  However, the rest of my family had a great time. Especially my dad. He loves Annas cooking and Portuguese food in general, so he ate like it was his last meal. The whole time, my mom was passive-aggressive, but everyone just kind of ignored it or didn't notice. The formal dinner is where the issue happened. Annas family is loud and jokey, so while everyone was talking, my mom loudly said that all we needed were red noses and this would be a circus. Everyone went quiet because her tone made it very clear she wasn't joking. I could see Anna stopping her grandma from arguing with my mom, but she (my mom) and my dad started quietly arguing. Dinner was awkward for the rest of the night, and when everyone left after coffee and dessert, my dad pulled Anna aside and apologized to her, and hugged her. Afterward, I made the mistake of saying she couldn't be surprised because I warned her. She rolled her eyes and said I guess I also can't be surprised that you wouldn't defend me. This sparked an argument until she told me that she didn't want to argue she was just disappointed in me. I could hear her crying in the shower later. I keep trying to talk about this because I can tell it's still bothering her, even though I warned her of what would happen.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1670441548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfb38m/aita_for_telling_my_gf_she_shouldnt_be_surprised/", "score": 6105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should be reconsidering the relationship. You care for her so little that you didn't do jack shit to stop your ridiculously rude mother from mistreating her; you even let her insult her and your in-laws who according to you are wonderful.

Also, this is a very short version of events because of the character limit. \n\nI (24 M) have been dating Anna (22 F) for four years. We moved in together last year. Anna is a big soccer fan and asked if we could convince my mom to let us host thanksgiving this year because Portugal was playing, and she wanted to watch, and my mom is the \"no electronics allowed on Thanksgiving\" type of person. I warned her that she knows my mom is picky, and she promised she would make traditional thanksgiving food alongside the Portuguese food (she wanted traditional food because she was missing home a lot more this year). So I relented and convinced my mom because I wanted Anna to be happy.\n\nAnna cooked all week (she is seriously one of the best cooks of all time). She made a big spread of Portuguese food like codfish, green soup, roasted pig, chorizo (her grandma makes it herself it's the most delicious thing in the world), cheese, etc., and all the typical American food spread like turkey, gravy, etc. My mom, dad, cousins, and grandparents came over. Annas mom, dad, two brothers, and grandma are the only ones that could make it for obvious reasons. I could tell my mom was already displeased about the TV being on, especially because of how loud Annas family gets over soccer.  However, the rest of my family had a great time. Especially my dad. He loves Annas cooking and Portuguese food in general, so he ate like it was his last meal. The whole time, my mom was passive-aggressive, but everyone just kind of ignored it or didn't notice. The formal dinner is where the issue happened. Annas family is loud and jokey, so while everyone was talking, my mom loudly said that all we needed were red noses and this would be a circus. Everyone went quiet because her tone made it very clear she wasn't joking. I could see Anna stopping her grandma from arguing with my mom, but she and my dad started quietly arguing. Dinner was awkward for the rest of the night, and when everyone left after coffee and dessert, my dad pulled Anna aside and apologized to her, and hugged her. Afterward, I made the mistake of saying she couldn't be surprised because I warned her. She rolled her eyes and said I guess I also can't be surprised that you wouldn't defend me. This sparked an argument until she told me that she didn't want to argue she was just disappointed in me. I could hear her crying in the shower later. I keep trying to talk about this because I can tell it's still bothering her, even though I warned her of what would happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If your Mom forces you to choose sides, as long as your relationship with Anna is loving and healthy, you choose your partner. I suspect that there has been many other bumps along the way and Anna and your Mom have been at odds before, or that your mother has said unkind things. I have no idea whether your Mom's immaturity in this situation is due to long standing conflict, jealousy of Anna taking over role of leading Lady in your life, a personality that needs to control things, or something else.

You need to tell your parents what is expected of them when they are under your roof.

You on the other hand just said what did you expect, and I think what she expected was more comfort and support from you after what happened.
