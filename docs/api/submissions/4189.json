Also, this is a very short version of events because of the character limit.\n\nI (24 M) have been dating Anna (22 F) for four years. We moved in together last year. Anna is a big soccer fan and asked if we could convince my mom to let us host thanksgiving this year because Portugal was playing, and she wanted to watch, and my mom is the \"no electronics allowed on Thanksgiving\" type of person. I warned her that she knows my mom is picky, and she promised she would make traditional thanksgiving food alongside the Portuguese food (she wanted traditional food because she was missing home a lot more this year). So I relented and convinced my mom because I wanted Anna to be happy.\n\nAnna cooked all week (she is seriously one of the best cooks of all time). She made a big spread of Portuguese food like codfish, green soup, roasted pig, chorizo (her grandma makes it herself it's the most delicious thing in the world), cheese, etc., and all the typical American food spread like turkey, gravy, etc. My mom, dad, cousins, and grandparents came over. Annas mom, dad, two brothers, and grandma are the only ones that could make it for obvious reasons. I could tell my mom was already displeased about the TV being on, especially because of how loud Annas family gets over soccer.  However, the rest of my family had a great time. Especially my dad. He loves Annas cooking and Portuguese food in general, so he ate like it was his last meal. The whole time, my mom was passive-aggressive, but everyone just kind of ignored it or didn't notice. The formal dinner is where the issue happened. Annas family is loud and jokey, so while everyone was talking, my mom loudly said that all we needed were red noses and this would be a circus. Everyone went quiet because her tone made it very clear she wasn't joking. I could see Anna stopping her grandma from arguing with my mom, but she (my mom) and my dad started quietly arguing. Dinner was awkward for the rest of the night, and when everyone left after coffee and dessert, my dad pulled Anna aside and apologized to her, and hugged her. Afterward, I made the mistake of saying she couldn't be surprised because I warned her. She rolled her eyes and said I guess I also can't be surprised that you wouldn't defend me. This sparked an argument until she told me that she didn't want to argue she was just disappointed in me. I could hear her crying in the shower later. I keep trying to talk about this because I can tell it's still bothering her, even though I warned her of what would happen.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1670441548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zfb38m/aita_for_telling_my_gf_she_shouldnt_be_surprised/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should be reconsidering the relationship. You care for her so little that you didn't do jack shit to stop your ridiculously rude mother from mistreating her; you even let her insult her and your in-laws who according to you are wonderful.

Anna is a big soccer fan and asked if we could convince my mom to let us host thanksgiving this year because Portugal was playing, and she wanted to watch, and my mom is the \"no electronics allowed on Thanksgiving\" type of person. I warned her that she knows my mom is picky, and she promised she would make traditional thanksgiving food alongside the Portuguese food (she wanted traditional food because she was missing home a lot more this year). So I relented and convinced my mom because I wanted Anna to be happy.\n\nAnna cooked all week (she is seriously one of the best cooks of all time). She made a big spread of Portuguese food like codfish, green soup, roasted pig, chorizo (her grandma makes it herself it's the most delicious thing in the world), cheese, etc., and all the typical American food spread like turkey, gravy, etc. My mom, dad, cousins, and grandparents came over. Annas mom, dad, two brothers, and grandma are the only ones that could make it for obvious reasons. I could tell my mom was already displeased about the TV being on, especially because of how loud Annas family gets over soccer.  However, the rest of my family had a great time. Especially my dad. He loves Annas cooking and Portuguese food in general, so he ate like it was his last meal. The whole time, my mom was passive-aggressive, but everyone just kind of ignored it or didn't notice. The formal dinner is where the issue happened. Annas family is loud and jokey, so while everyone was talking, my mom loudly said that all we needed were red noses and this would be a circus. Everyone went quiet because her tone made it very clear she wasn't joking. I could see Anna stopping her grandma from arguing with my mom, but she and my dad started quietly arguing. Dinner was awkward for the rest of the night, and when everyone left after coffee and dessert, my dad pulled Anna aside and apologized to her, and hugged her. Afterward, I made the mistake of saying she couldn't be surprised because I warned her. She rolled her eyes and said I guess I also can't be surprised that you wouldn't defend me. This sparked an argument until she told me that she didn't want to argue she was just disappointed in me. I could hear her crying in the shower later. I keep trying to talk about this because I can tell it's still bothering her, even though I warned her of what would happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your mom was rude about her family and you\u2019re blaming your gf?", "YTA I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she broke up with you.  Your behavior was terrible. On top of your mother terrible behavior.

Your mom was rude AF and all you can say is \"I warned you this would happen\"....your warned her your mom would act like an asshole or that you are spineless and couldn't stand up for your GF and say something?

When two families combine (this was a test for you two btw, which is probably why Anna was so upset with your mother\u2019s reaction and your ambivalence to it) cultures will need to find an amicable way to be together. Naturally this mostly happens during holidays. Anna did her all to make this something both of your families could enjoy, because your girlfriend really, really wanted to see how good your families interact. Your mom sounds like she\u2019s the only person who didn\u2019t want peace. Her reasons are her own, but likely misplaced emotions or judgments or lack of control. You need to defend your girlfriend, not your mom. She sounds like a winner. Time to grow up.", "YTA and so is your mom. My family is loud as hell. My husband isn\u2019t used to all the noise. He steps outside when he needs a minute. That\u2019s what you do in situations like this. Your mom is rude as hell and you should have told her to go home if she hated it so much. This isn\u2019t a \u201cI told you so moment\u201d to your girlfriend. For her it\u2019s a redefining if she wants to be in a relationship with you moment.

I'd be disappointed in you too tbh. YTA.", "YTA. You aren't getting it. You're too focused on keeping the peace with your mom that you are letting her be shitty to your girlfriend, your girlfriend's family, and frankly the rest of your family.

In a healthy relationship you don't find joy in being RIGHT, you find peace in compromise and growing together.

You probably mean Ebenezer Scrooge.", "Dudes own dad saw his WIFE WAS in the wrong. Lol omg", "YTA Your mother was downright rude. And you agreed with that op", "Yeah, I see what you are saying. I just got awkward and clammed up because of how dinner went and I couldn't think of anything else to say except what I did. I don't want to lose her", "Why are people accusing my mom of racism? She was wrong, no doubt, but she's never had an issue with their culture or accents.", "I don't think it's about the fact that they aren't from America, I just think it's about the fact they are loud people. My mom has never shown any issues with their accents or parts of their culture.", "I can not even express how bad that would've been if Annas grandma did that. Like I realize my mom may not be the best person in the world for what she did, but that would've burned thanksgiving to the ground.

As a fellow Portuguese I can guarantee we are loud af and we enjoy it. When it gets too much the people bothered just go to another room for a bit.

No one disrespects my loved ones in my house and no one disrespects my SOs family on my watch, even my family. \n\nYTA", "Seriously!

Their culture was the problem that caused your mother to accuse them of being a bunch of clowns because what? They like to talk at the dinner table and wanted to support their country's football team. Anna made food to accommodate your mother who no doubt would have thrown a fit if it wasn't available.

She was disparaging them for their cultural practices. She was calling them clowns for partaking in their cultural. That is racist. Watching soccer, eating traditional food, and talking with your family, all of that is a part of their culture. But because it's outside of what your mom considers acceptable, she talked shit about them. And you backed her up. You basically told your gf that she was wrong in thinking that her family deserves human decency from your mother.
