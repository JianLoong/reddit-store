You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table.\n\n\nI recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an \"extention\" to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to \"force\" our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't.\n\n\nWe haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now.\n\n\nedit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have.", "created_utc": 1670244382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd5vpq/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_wont_attend_their/", "score": 2295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I put myself in the parents' shoes for a minute and my first thought was, well, I'd tell Luke to get stuffed even if it means missing out on one Christmas with my kid, but then the next though was that this would be a major milestone in Luke's attempts to separate OP from her family. As a parent, would you suck it up so you don't lose your daughter and hope she sees sense before it's too late or do you stick to your guns and risk her distancing herself from you?
