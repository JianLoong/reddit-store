However, having you narrate/talk while we are watching a movie or TV is disruptive. Also, I understand what she is doing is important to you, we would like a bit more quiet time and hearing her describ everything that is being done is distracting, could you take those calls in the room you are staying in\u201d\n\nHowever, you didn\u2019t and you should be able ti enjoy your shows, time after work, activites in your home without the disruption of hours long video call.\n\nHe was a guest in your home and should be respective of that situation. \n\nNTA", "Talking to his wife and facetiming throughout the day is fine.

You should give them your main attention while you're with them, and take it elsewhere if you want to make a call. The movie bit would've made me lose it, too.

My brother does the same thing it's rude and it works my nerves if I have a house full of people over and we're watching a movie nobody wants to be part of your shenanigans go in another room and talk. Also why is it necessary to facetime every time you call talk on the phone nobody wants to hear your crap I know I don't and then the volume is always up as loud as the phone will go.

He\u2019s apparently being loud and you asked him to go into the room (admittedly not very nicely), but not an unreasonable request, although you could\u2019ve been nicer about it. No, you SHOULD HAVE BEEN NICER ABOUT IT!!! Perhaps he felt very comfortable around your home, which says a lot as to how he views your relationship, or should I say viewed? \n\nYou admitted you hate being away from your husband. Maybe they feel the same. You should understand that more than most. Why does it bother you he brings the phone in while he\u2019s having dinner? Maybe he loves having his wife \u201cwith him\u201d and his family as he has dinner with you! What\u2019s the big deal about speaking to her while you all eat? Does it REALLY put you out THAT much? \n\nI feel like you\u2019re the bigger AH here. Aside from the movie and game \u201cblow by blows,\u201d it doesn\u2019t really put you out. If you\u2019re needing quiet, and he\u2019s being loud, there\u2019s definitely a nicer way to ask him to take it to another room so you\u2019re able to decompress.", "YTA.
