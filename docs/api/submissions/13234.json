And, if the chore is a time-sensitive thing, even if it is usually her chore, you just gotta suck that up sometimes. While mom probably will understand you needing to finish out your battle, a burning meal, a garbage truck won't, or a dog who needs to pee right now likely won't.", "Radahn actually", "I knew I'd get grounded.

Dude, doing the bare minimum and housing and feeding children and not beating them is not praise worthy. \n\nI don\u2019t agree with the tit for tat thing, but that should have been a) a learning moment for mom and b) something to sit down and discuss.\n\nAlso, your pets, your responsibility. I have my pets. As such, they are not the responsibility of my SO, or children. I pay for them and deal with all the required care unless I physically can\u2019t. Children do not exist to stack chores on like a housekeeper; they have their share of chores in the household as they are part of the household. No more, no less.", "I actually agree with you that if your parents treat you with honesty and reasonableness that you should return it to them. But this attitude:  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Just straight up to be clear. You don't owe your parents anything, not respect, not time, effort or anything else no matter what people say, they decided to have kids and that means they took on the responsibility to care for you\n\nis such transactional bullshit. You are right, you don't technically owe your parents anything. I am not one of those \"you should be grateful for having been given life at all\" people. But if you are going that route, you have to understand that our parents technically don't owe us anything either, except to keep us alive and minimally well until we're eighteen. That is, what parents owe their minor children is to make sure they are sent to school and adequately sheltered, fed, cleaned, and clothed until they reach the age of majority. That's it. \n\nAfter that, they don't *have* to do anything. When a kid hits 18, parents also technically *owe* their kids nothing. And even before that, they don't have to love their kids or respect them, or get them a PS4 or Domino's or put any other time or effort in, aside from the minimum, either. They don't even have to like them. \n\nAll of that is technically correct on both sides. But it definitely isn't morally correct, for anyone.", "Any particular reason, or should I just keep laughing at you?", "Slight correction, I fully intended to do it regardless. She just didn't wanna wait for so long (5 minutes max)", "I wasn't aware expecting pizza when promised pizza was \"entitled\"", "And bending over is physically taxing? Because that\u2019s all she had to do to clean it bet she did a lot of that in yoga", "It depends on the mom you have. It certainly works well with mine, which is why I said basically \u201cmileage can vary\u201d Being open and honest about your feelings can help and if it doesn\u2019t that says more about her than it does about you.", "That\u2019s not what he said at all. He said that the mom taking care of OP isn\u2019t a reason for her to be an asshole. I do agree that saying \u2018move out and go NC\u2019 is crazy for this small of a thing though.", "Then it certainly was unfair that she didn't honor what she agreed to do.\n\nI don't think that returning that behavior gave you any moral high ground though.\n\nPetty can be fun, but you have to be in a position of power to pull it off without consequences, which you learned when you got grounded. :/\n\n>Her reasoning was that she shouldn't bargain with me\n\nThen she proceeds to make another bargain with you.\n\n>I said I'd do the dishes if she got me some McDonald's. She got McDonald's, and I didn't do the dishes\n\nSo you've also taught her that bargains with you are also a bad idea. I wonder how that is going to play out for you both? Is that a game you can win? If not, don't play it.\n\nOverall, this really should have been solved with communication. I saw that she didn't listen to you when you argued with her, so I can see how \"communication\" doesn't seem effective. However, I still think it would be wise for you to try to resolve this differently before this escalates further. I don't think it will benefit either of you to continue this way. \n\nIt sounds like your mother might be tired? Does that impact her communication skills? If so, then you should be strategic about how and especially *when* to have a conversation. You will have better luck when she is rested and in a decent mood. She doesn't sound like the best communicator, so having a strategy that isn't confrontational might help you find a better middle ground.", "Ok so according to your reasoning: I hope you cook when you're hungry, that you clean everything you use, that you buy with your money everything you need and that you wash your own laundry... Your needs, your shit.", "Elden ring is not a novice game and any non novice knows the basics of pausing.

I dont usually negotiate with my kids about family service, or chores. Legit you can get off the game and scoop the box without complaining. The cat is part of the family and has needs that go above and beyond your need to game. And you shouldnt need to be bribed to contribute. Your mom though should have brought the pizza and had a chat with you going forward. You deserve the grounding though cause you went above and beyond to be malicious.", "Yeah maybe.", "Did you even read my comment? Not every yoga asana requires bending over or stretching or other things. Some can be done while simply sitting cross-legged. You do mudras with your hands and work on your breathing. \nAnd like I said, I wasn\u2019t defending OP\u2019s mom. It was her job to clean it. If she was unwell, she could\u2019ve done it later or waited for OP to finish their game and do it later. She\u2019s very much the A-H here.", "I do all of that except but everything with my money.

I didn't for a good while either and it's very wierd for you to assume they're lying about it.", "Would you considered it out of place for an adult to pay another adult for taking care of their pets?

Did you not know that", "Ummmm that's not weird if you help out a roommate once in awhile with there pets.\n\nActually I would say its kinda common.", "Wait, no. That's not cool. Of course changing the cat litter sucks. I don't blame you for wanting to not do it at all, and certainly not for preferring to eat pizza!

She chose to deceive her son. Choices have consequences.
