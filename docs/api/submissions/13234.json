That is, what parents owe their minor children is to make sure they are sent to school and adequately sheltered, fed, cleaned, and clothed until they reach the age of majority. That's it. \n\nAfter that, they don't *have* to do anything. When a kid hits 18, parents also technically *owe* their kids nothing.
