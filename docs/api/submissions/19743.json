Have you suggested using this app to find places? \n\nAlso, NTA because it sounds as if you aren\u2019t stopping him from going to the restaurants/pizzerias that he wants to try.

If it was less frequent then that would be different.", "NTA\n\nEven when I'm out with friends I make sure there is something they **CAN** eat, its honestly f\\*ed up that your own partner would feel comfortable to let you starve next to them.\n\nLeave that narcissist and go somewhere else where there is nice food.", "NTA. You\u2019re married to a selfish, immature ass. Like, does his brain truly not comprehend what an allergy is? Does he really think it\u2019s acceptable to bully you into sitting there watching him eat?\n\nStop indulging this, ever. Do not go. And I have to assume this probably isn\u2019t the only way this man is immature and selfish in your marriage.", "NTA.

It\u2019s bizarre to want you, specifically, to go and sit to watch him eat\u2026 It might be that he isn\u2019t taking your allergy seriously, which is extremely rude and dismissive. Either way, whether he\u2019s waving off your allergy or waving off your needs as less than his, it\u2019s horribly un-empathetic and selfish of him. I could see this behavior from a shitty friend you\u2019re meeting up with for lunch, NOT your life partner. \n\nI\u2019m type 1 diabetic and often can\u2019t eat much from the places my partner super enjoys. We\u2019ll compromise by finding two things close together and picking them both up, or finding a place we both are okay with for dinner, and then we grab dessert for him afterward.\n\nINFO: Have you actually gone at this point and just watched him eat? Or has this all been in theory for him and he hasn\u2019t had to sit through the horrifically awkward dinner?", "Italy is honestly really good for coeliacs. You just need the words 'Senza Glutine'.  For a country known for its pizzas and pastas it has a lot of coeliacs.  Look for signs at the restaurant for 'AIC', which is the Italian Coeliacs Society, they accredit restaurants.", "NTA. You\u2019re a celiac, and he can go without gluten. Even if you weren\u2019t allergic and it was just a lifestyle choice still NTA.

It's not like Italians just hoover pizza and pasta 24/7.\n\nThe alternating choices isn't really fair when his choice means you can't eat.  Frankly, I'd feel awful being the guy eating while my hungry wife watched me.\n\n(I'm accepting two facts here as true - it's a legit and serious gluten allergy and the restaurants he picks really don't have GF options.)", "NTA reasonable choices are he picks a place where you can eat or he goes alone, the absurdity of having to sit there watching him eat something you cant eat is just nuts", "NTA. There are many many Italian restaurants in Italy where there are options without gluten, I'm not talking abt gluten free alternatives, I'm talking about salads, antipastis, steaks, fish, etc... on top of normal pastas and pizzas.

NTA", "NTA- my heart breaks for you because Italy is one of the best places for gluten free food!! It\u2019s counterintuitive but I have had the best gluten free pasta and pizza in my life in Italy. So much better than anywhere else. You need to ditch him if he won\u2019t compromise.", "Did you try asking? I've never had problems getting gluten free in Italy.", "INFO: Does he do this when you're back home? Being in italy kinda complicates things, becuase of course he would excited to try italian pizzas. \n\nIf he does this back home as well, he is soooo inconsiderate", "NTA - asking you to go to a restaurant where you can't eat is wildly selfish. If he has to have pizza, he can go with a friend or by himself.", "NTA he can look up the best pizzas places with gluten free options in sure they exist in Italy I\u2019ve seen people on Insta trying them \n\nI\u2019m vegan which is harder when I\u2019m outwith the uk. when we eat out we get excited to research the best places with options for me it\u2019s fun \n\nAnd then if there\u2019s somewhere he really really wants to try that can be for a special occasion not all the time", "Have you asked the restaurants about GF options? Italy is probably the best place in the world to be if you\u2019re GF. It\u2019s taken more seriously there than anywhere else, IMO. \n\nNTA. I\u2019m GF, and it sucks hard to not be able to eat when everyone else is.", "NTA. There's a difference between a preference and a need. As long as he picks restaurants that meet your needs, that's a reasonable plan. As it is, he's being spectacularly selfish by  thinking it's okay for you to sit there and watch him eat while you can't.", "NTA\n\nBecause you need to be able to eat. I just wanted to point out that Italy is quite progressive when it comes to gluten, and they have a very big celiac community as they diagnose at a very young age almost routinely.\n\nSo it might just be worth asking at normal restaurants if they have gluten-free dishes. The term is \u201csenza glutine\u201d and many restaurants that serve both pasta and pizza are very understanding and will try to accommodate you", "NTA. I'm celiac and I'm too damn old to spend the day drinking water in restaurants with inconsiderate assholes. \n\nWhy does your husband not love you enough to allow you to eat and why do you accept being treated like that?", "NTA your husband is being a complete tosspot. \n\nHowever, on a side note: Italy is actually really good for people with gluten intolerance as a weirdly high percentage of Italian children have it. Gluten intolerant people can get free GF products at pharmacies. Anyway as a visitor one thing you can do is get the the AIC ( Associazione Italiana Celiachia - Italian coeliac association) app ( I think there is a small cost involved).  Not only does the app (and the AIC website it\u2019s linked to) contain where to eat but it also lists who to speak to when you get there; they list the person responsible for gluten free food in that establishment, as well as some information on opening hours.\n\nEnjoy Italy!", "I\u2019m the same as you. Guess what! My husbands first thought is \u201cwhat can my wife eat if we go here\u201d and he loves pizza too. He would never let me sit there with no food because it\u2019s insanely selfish. It\u2019s not like you can opt out of being gluten free. NTA at all. Your husband needs to pull his head out of his ass and realize pizza isn\u2019t more important than his wife.", "I wish people would stop dating people who dislike you. Your husband refuses to accomodate your allergies, even though they have gluten-free pizza in Italy? The standard is in hell. NTA but your marriage sounds disrespectful", "That's really not cool. So you're suppose to just go hungry? Hubby needs to learn to work with your ailment, and leaving you hungry isn't it. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Of course he can choose one restaurant per day - on condition that somewhere on the menu there is something you can eat, and will find appetising. Make him do the legwork.", "NTA - My fianc\u00e9e is a little picky and gets anxiety easily from trying new places. I love trying new foods. If we eat together, we go to one of her comfort restaurants. If I want to try something new, I go by myself or with a friend. I don\u2019t hold that against her. When I was vegetarian she gave up some of those comfort restaurants to try places with options for me. The point of this story?\n\nIf your husband realizes that you\u2019re allergic to gluten, and gets upset when you don\u2019t go with him just because he doesn\u2019t like to go alone or with friends, then please let him know that he\u2019s being selfish. It\u2019s not hard to compromise in my situation, and yours is much more important. If he can\u2019t compromise with you on something that can harm you especially, then don\u2019t compromise for him. Don\u2019t go, or go to a different restaurant. I\u2019m not gonna be like most AITA people and scream to get a divorce, but you\u2019re allowed to let him have it if he\u2019s being a jerk and not letting you pick your restaurants like he said you could. I get you\u2019re in Italy and he wants to try the food, but at the expense of you having to watch him eat while hungry? Not exactly loving.", "NTA most of the time it's not an issue except when it comes to restaurants", "Is there anything he can't eat? I would honestly make every single choice something he can't or won't eat. Better actually if he just won't because then you can point out that you're making the effort to choose things he can eat since you know what it's like to go hungry because your partner refuses to choose places that are safe for you.", "NYA.\nYou\u2019re married to the asshole.  Gluten allergies,\nNot sensitivities, are a serious issue.\n\nHe either doesn\u2019t understand or doesn\u2019t care.\n\nEither way makes him the asshole.  Given that he is, you know, YOUR HUSBAND!", "NAH - I think you two just need to work out a compromise that feels good to both of you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for him to have to avoid gluten on vacation in Italy because *you* can\u2019t eat it. It reminds me of women insisting that their husbands can\u2019t drink because they\u2019re pregnant. Let the man enjoy some gluten-y pizza and make sure you get some good gluten-free options in there too. Everyone can have their needs met here.", "NTA when you're at home - that's ridiculous. He should be better about this when you're not traveling and his inability to do so while at home is frankly immature.\n\nItaly, though....Idk, I lean NAH for Italy. It's a harder country to be gluten free in (I lived there for a time) but not impossible. Most places have a vegetable and meat section of the menu that doesn't contain pizza or pasta. It's fair that he wants to experience what is a gluten heavy cuisine and for the sake of the trip I'm not sure you should take it so personally in this specific location.", "NTA. Italy\u2019s gluten free products are numerous & better than what we have in the States. Stores are stocked w lots of choices. Restaurants are probably similar. Your husband shouldn\u2019t be afraid to try a place w gluten free options. It\u2019s not cool he is being so selfish & ignoring your health needs. I would be PISSED", "I'm going with a very soft YTA. You had me on your side up until you mentioned you are in Italy. I've been to Italy several times and I know for a fact not every dish served in every restaurant is a pasta dish. You can certainly order meat, fish, vegetables, a salad. And that holds true here in the states too. And here in the states, gluten free is starting to become popular on menus, even pizzerias. Perhaps you can reach a compromise. Take turns choosing the restaurant when you two decide to go out for dinner. He gets to go to his favorite pizzeria when it's his turn, you get to go to your favorite place when it's your turn.", "Yta but only a little  I have had arfid and eating disorder my whole life. I've had to compromise and also sit at restaurants the ppl I'm dating want to go. It's what u do for those u love. Also it's Italy. Not a place u go every day and he wants tontry once in a lifetime pizza places. So u Compromise and when u go to a place u can eat let him manage the child.", "INFO: how often does he want to go to a pizza place when you're not traveling? Why, when you're at home, is it especially important that you're the one that goes with him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now, I think there's an at home answer, and a travelling in Italy answer. At home, NTA, in Italy, NAH, but he should be ready for two sit down meals or another reasonable filling food stop if he chooses somewhere you can't eat at.", "NTA for not wanting to go sit while your husband eats in front of you. \nIs it a true allergy or sensitivity? My husband has the sensitivity which causes awful effects but is not an allergy. We have heard that many restaurants in Italy have gluten-free alternatives, and often, their wheat does not irritate gluten sensitivity. Is he pushing you out of your comfort zone and asking you to risk your health on these premises?", "NTA at all. \n\nI can\u2019t have dairy, so if my partner and I go out to eat - we choose somewhere where I can eat something too. \n\nPlaces in Italy for eg some of the pizzerias don\u2019t have vegan cheese or pasta, just pizzas - so we tend to not go to these because unless I\u2019m having the basic margarita no cheese then I have nothing to eat. Does my partner love pizza? They\u2019re Italian and it\u2019s in their blood to love pizza more than life itself. But does my partner want me to sit there and watch them eat whilst I have just a drink? Absolutely not because they\u2019re not an AH", "Info: Where in Italy are you?
