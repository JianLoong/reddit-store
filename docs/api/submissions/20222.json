It's his place.\n\nHot tip, if you can't deal with random annoying shit like this, don't stay at other people's houses.", "YTA. You were only there for two days! How many times could this have happened? Twice? You should have kept your mouth shut.", "YTA - he's probably used to having the bathroom to himself and using it whenever he wants to, but now maybe sees it being occupied longer than he would have expected so decided to finish off his routine. Don't see anything wrong with it, inconvenience sure, but it's just minor", "YTA, Maybe he worries that you'll go #2 and stink up the place, maybe you going to the bathroom reminds him of what he needs to do there too, or maybe the room is too warm after you take a shower.

I\u2019d totally get him. When I lived with roommates in a single bathroom apartment, I\u2019d generally tell people I\u2019m about to shower/hold up the bathroom in case anyone wants to go first.

It could be some form of OCD.", "He's the camera", "NTA. Test him. Tell him well in advance that you'll be showering in 30 mins, see if he goes right before you had intended to shower or if he goes immediately when you say. Then change your mind and don't shower, you're too tired and will do it in the morning. Watch to see if he goes back to the bathroom. If he does, he's doing something before you go in there - as others have said, possibly turning on a hidden camera.\n\nIf you have any time alone there, go and look around for one. Maybe turn the light off and use a torch to look for a reflection on a tiny lens. Check anywhere that would have a direct(ish) view on the shower, toilet or where you'd normally get changed. Look for anything where a screw or nail might normally be.", "In the last scenario you were both talking on the couch before bed. I'm assuming you both were going right to bed after. Doesn't seem weird that he would ask to brush his teeth quickly before you use the bathroom, if that's all he has to do before bed.

I was upset because I\u2019m sure that had I not made a move for the bathroom, he would have stayed on the couch for longer\n\nUsually if I'm talking to someone late at night I'm not going to randomly get up to brush my teeth until it's actually time to go to bed. This instance on its own doesn't seem like weird asshole behavior to me. \n\nThe fact you're seeing a pattern might be weird, but it's hard to say. I certainly wouldn't jump to the hidden camera conclusion. Maybe there's a bit of OCD or general concern about you going in the bathroom and it not being clean/presentable? I could see that being the case, especially with an older man who's not used to living with a woman. I feel like I'd need more info.", "INFO - when you say everytime is it literally everytime (like when you need the toilet as well) or just everytime you want to shower? \n\nIf its literally everytime then yeah that's a bit odd and questionable. Not sure I'd jump straight to something as creepy as a camera if this is the only odd thing he's doing but still.\n\nIf we're talking just when you shower though then I'd consider that fine and normal. I've always asked people if they need to use the bathroom for any reason if I'm about to shower when with family or staying at friends, but that's always because if I don't someone will knock halfway through to rush me because they need it.", "I mean it could be something nefarious. Or it could be that he had no reason to brush his teeth for bed while he was sitting on the couch chatting with somebody for over an hour.", "NTA I had a roommate like this \u2014 she didn\u2019t have any interest in the bathroom until I wanted to use it, would rush to beat me to it if she saw me headed that way or would knock on the door to use the toilet once I was 2 minutes into a short shower.\n\nYeah, some people can be really weird about using bathrooms.", "NAH:\nHe wanted to brush his teeth because his friend was going to bed and he didn't need to host you.\n\nHe wanted to go first because he felt you would take too long.", "How does a camera make any sense? You surely wouldn't have to turn it on and then off again everytime.\n\nI now this situation from a past relationship. If one of us needed to do big business or shower the other one would quickly jump to the bathroom before for a pee.", "Meh, I see both sides. NAH\n\nI am guilty of that myself sometimes. I know that I have to brush my teeth, but it feels like I have plenty of time to do it so there\u2019s no rush. When someone announces they\u2019re going to the bathroom for whatever reason, it gives me a sense of, IDK, urgency? Scarcity? I realize that the bathroom isn\u2019t going to be available for a while and that I\u2019ll have to wait for it to be free again no matter how long that might take, which may or may not cause me issues down the line. Since brushing one\u2019s teeth is much quicker than a shower, it seems logical to do it first. \n\nIs it possible he has a camera in there? Sure, but it\u2019s a stretch. I would give him the benefit of the doubt, unless he tends to be a creep in general. \n\nI totally understand why it\u2019s annoying for you and where you\u2019re coming from though! You\u2019re not in the wrong because it rubs you the wrong way!\n\nWith my family and friends, we usually ask if anyone needs to use the bathroom quick (like number one or teeth brushing) beforehand if we plan on being in it for more than five minutes. That way, everyone gets everything done and the ones who need the bathroom longer aren\u2019t in a rush. You could start asking \u201cdo you need the bathroom?\u201d and see what he says. \n\nOr, if you are really worried he might be doing something creepy, you could leave his toothbrush and toothpaste on the table or somewhere like that so he can brush his teeth using the kitchen sink. That way, he can do his thing and you can still protect yourself.", "Does he have some sort of anxiety? Maybe he's having a panic of \"oh god did I flush/clean up\" whenever you headed towards the loo?\n\nOr he's some sort of closet misogynist who's convinced all women spend forever in the bathroom making themselves look good?\n\nThe other comments regarding a camera are unfortunately something you need to consider as well, no matter how well you think you know him.\n\nI'm curious how often you were needing the bathroom for it to be such a big issue by day 2 though! I can understand if you were staying longer you snapping at him, but staying for a weekend on the face of it I don't quite see why it was such an annoyance to you, unless he was acting really shady each time", "I'm wondering if he has a camera hidden in the bathroom. I'd look for one. Don't stay there again.", "People with IBS can have a sudden urge for bowel movement due to the stress not able to use the toilet.\nMaybe he has some bowel issue?", "NAH, leaning towards a light Y-T-A. I say this because I've lived with someone who has a tendency to take ages in the bathroom so I get where he's coming from. It's annoying when you have to do something that only takes a minute but you can't do it because you have to wait for someone else to do something that takes significantly longer -- and until then you can't go to sleep. These days she usually just lets me go first.\n\nThe reason he's deciding to go to bed right when you do is because you guys were spending time together. When you leave, that automatically ends, so in his mind there probably is no reason to just... stay behind and lounge on the couch alone. Bedtime it is.\n\nThe people jumping to a hidden camera are ~~insane~~ pretty on brand for this place. I prefer to take the occam's razor approach and say he's ikely just impatient.", "I had a similar situation with my sister in law, staying in a small apartment. Every single time I got up to go to the bathroom she\u2019d ask if it was ok to pop ahead of me. Every. Single. Time.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell me this but I know she was on her period. However I myself was heavily pregnant and not once had I spent a long time in there. It really really began to fuck me off. Seems like every time I mentioned it, it would remind her that she had this terrible urgent issue and must take the opportunity to sort it while she could. \n\nIn the end I realised it was pretty simple: I stopped telling anyone I was going to use the bathroom and just did it. Problem solved. \n\nCamera idea hadn\u2019t occurred to me but it does seem worth investigating too.", "NTA, but it may not be anything strange from his point of view. My dad has a similar habit - he tends to forget that he needs to go to the bathroom and seeing someone else getting up reminds him that he needs to go NOW. Que some really absurd situations. Super annoying but what can you do.", "NTA. But don't crucify the guy because my missus does the same, we will be in bed together for an hour looking at our phones and the second I say I am going to the toilet that reminds her she 'needs the toilet'. You are staying with him for a couple of days so grin and bear the adhd(or creepy) idiot.", "For that particular case you were a bit of an asshole because brushing teeth takes a lot less than showering and maybe he was enjoying the moment while you were chatting and not even thinking of going to bed. \n\nThe other times \u2026 hm I\u2019m torn between him being one of those jackass men who only know stereotypes about women \u2026 like they take long to get ready\u2026 or that he\u2019s a creep and as someone else said in the comments, was turning on a hidden camera\u2026 \nHe might also be quite fastidious and wanted to make sure everything was clean before you went in. But I haven\u2019t seen many men like that in real life.", "NTA. Don\u2019t stay with him anymore. He may be putting in a camera to spy on you. This is weird behavior.", "He wasn\u2019t brushing his teeth, he was adjusting the camera before secretly filming you. NTA.", "Girl he\u2019s got a camera in that bathroom. Bet he also pops back in there after you\u2019re done showering also, right? He\u2019s gotta go get his camera back", "Am I the only one who thought it was weird to write platonic before friend? Ain't the word friend already platonic?", "Hidden camera", "NTA not good host and definitely wouldn't stay with him. Classic male trying to say your taking long when in fact your being courteous of the bathroom usage. Now if he takes long to brush I would start to assume he is doing something to the bathroom.", "NTA but if you're gonna shower at someone else's house give them a heads up so they can pee first. They shouldn't have to race you. Be considerate.", "NTA he\u2019s either got some mental issues or\u2026.he needs to reset the camera he\u2019s got in his bathroom to get better shots of you.", "NTA: Find the camera. It's there.\n\nEdit: downvote away. There's a camera in that room and OP needs to find it.", "YTA. Yes, the only reason he was staying up was to talk to you so why would you expect him to stay up and just sit there without you? You want to shower and get ready for bed that takes 10-15 minutes, he wants to brush his teeth that takes 3 minutes. It's also his house and you're a guest. Just let him go first! In fact, if you know this bothers him, you should be saying things like \"In 15 minutes, I'm going to go shower\" so you give him a 15 minute window to do his business rather than hold the only bathroom hostage.  \n\n\nEdit: I didn't think of the video camera thing. That's quite the accusation but I guess it comes down to whether or not this actually happened every time you went to the bathroom or just most times when you announced you were having a shower. If it's the former, did you really announce that you were going to use the bathroom just for a pee? If so, why? Anyways, much more sinister and weird than I could ever imagine. How much do you trust this guy?", "I don\u2019t know why it upsets you that he wanted to brush his teeth quickly. Seeing as you were both going to bed, it means that he could do them and go straight to sleep - if you\u2019re showering etc who knows how long you\u2019d take, and he\u2019d have to sit in bed waiting to brush his teeth until you\u2019re done. Sure if you\u2019d waited longer, he would have waited longer - because you were talking and it\u2019s usually the last thing people do before bed (especially if you have a set routine, or ocd). So your \u2018I\u2019m going to shower before bed\u2019 signalled it\u2019s time to sleep, and he wanted to take two mins to not wait however long you\u2019d take. \n\nYTA for snapping. It\u2019s annoying if it\u2019s becoming a pattern that he always goes before you, but it\u2019s been one day\u2026 you\u2019re a guest and waiting for him to go first (quite possibly some sort of ocd or panic about not being able to pee when you\u2019re in there) is not such a big deal that you snap like this. He\u2019s your friend, have some patience?\n\nThen there is that scary possibility he is setting up a camera, which I\u2019ve read from the comments. Hope it\u2019s not that \ud83d\ude29", "Bro he didn't wanna wait 40 mins to brush his teeth when he could just do it now. Why he picked that exact moment? Probably because you guys just finished the conversation and it was time to hit the bed. You overreacting here but I can't speak on the previous incidents", "Is he just getting up to turn on the hidden camera?\n\nJust a thought. NTA.", "Honestly, first thought is there's a hidden camera. I'd look for it. NTA", "Call the police, tell them your story and that you suspect you were filmed without your permission. If anything at worst they'll have it on record and best case they'll find the camera in there and put that creep in prison.", "I'm curious, is it very common where you all live to have the toilet and shower in the same room?", "My innocent take would be that he, like me, hates that somebody (even worse if a girl) would see crap laying around in his bathroom, hairs, toothpaste stains in the sink, dirty mirror, dirty toilets ?\n\nThen the worst case, he turns on a camera or sum as everybody said", "I hope it's not a camera situation, but I also do this when my friends visit because I sometimes don't flush after peeing (I drink a ton), I do a quick check to make sure my bathroom is clean, and I also have bathroom anxiety. My FWB will take full hour poops and if he doesn't give me a heads up and I already have to pee, I can be very anxious and uncomfortable. The thought of not having constant access to my bathroom gives me anxiety, especially after I fostered a cat who wouldn't let me in my own bathroom for a week. I could see this going in an innocent or not so innocent direction, so I can't really vote.", "NTA and please don't stay with him again. Whatever is going on is not a good situation.\n\nAlso? As someone who sometimes gets so engrossed in whatever I'm doing that I usually HAVE to use the restroom when I get up to use the restroom, the first time he stopped me from going, I'd have been miserable... and I'd have grabbed my bags and checked into a hotel.", "YTA, have some consideration. It obviously takes way less time to brush your teeth than to take a shower. Dont feel too bad, living with someone is a learned skill and it takes a little practice.", "YTA. It's his place. Yes, it's annoying, but my BF is a bathroom hog, and it just makes good sense to pee or brush my teeth before he gets settled in.", "I'm getting..creepy perv vibes. Before you DO shower, check for cameras. Every outlet, the mirror, the light sockets and if there's a vent better check that too. \n\nTry not announcing your bathroom trips if he gets pissed abaout it I'd be very suspicious", "It seems very strange.  You are NTA at all.", "Gonna say NAH\n\nIf you look at it from his perspective, he is planning on going to bed but has to wait 10 minutes for you to shower, he likely doesn't have anything to do that takes less than 10 minutes\n\nLet him know when you are planning on doing things in advance, it won't make too big a difference to you", "YTA. It makes sense to me that he asked to grab his toothbrush before you went in the bathroom so that he could brush his teeth and go to sleep without having to wait for you to come out of the shower. That way he could already be asleep by the time you come out.\n\nThis doesn't come up with a roommate because it's free for all in using the bathroom, but if you're with a guest you probably hang out which means you end up having the same schedule (such as going to sleep once you go to sleep) which can explain why he uses the bathroom at the same time (such as bedtime routine). He probably just wanted to get out of your hair and go to bed and let you take as much time as you want to shower without having to worry that he needs his toothbrush.", "NTA. Sounds like a creeper. Who is setting up the camera. Don\u2019t stay there.", "Doesn\u2019t want to be sitting around waiting to use the bathroom if everyone is going to bed after. \n\nWants to get in first then go to sleep.", "YTA  \n\n\nof course he would have stayed on the couch. If you would have stayed there too. why should he sit there alone until you finished showering so he can brush his teeth? (something you do when going to bed. not an hour before going to bed. completely delusional)", "Hidden camera to watch you. Don\u2019t ever go back", "This is weird first thing came to my mind is a hidden camera.", "My wife does this all the time for the kitchen and bathroom. No hidden cameras.", "Now is the time to take that hour long \"shower\" and search that bathroom", "Everyone immediately deciding he is a creep. While that is possible, it could just as easily be him having adhd. (OP, be careful about possible hidden cam, just in case)", "NTA\n\nBut my brain did not go to the camera idea, i was thinking maybe he\u2019s ocd about his bathroom cleanliness and wanted to make sure it was clean before you used it.  lol Silly me.", "There is a hidden camera somewhere in there", "Spy cam.\n\nDon't return.\n\nNTA.\n\nBut he's been looking at . . .", "NTA his behavior is bizarre. I would also be kind of concerned there was a hidden camera in the bathroom that he was rushing to turn on to record since he always had to go in there before you. I would stay in a hotel next time you visit (if you do ever want to visit again.)", "NTA. All the people are pointing out he might be a peeve with a hidden camera", "NTA for getting upset. \n\nBut I am the same. If I was sat chatting with a friend and the only reason I was up was the conversation when they said they were going to shower and go to bed I would jump in first as taking a pee and brushing my teeth is quicker. No reason for me to sit on the couch waiting for them.", "I live with my girlfriend and she basically does the same thing to me haha", "Dude it sounds like he is recording you. He runs to the restroom right before you do? He is recording you in the restroom!", "There is a camera for sure. Probably saving memory by turning it on only when you go to the bathroom.", "NAH:  I live by myself and recently shared a room with a friend to go to a conference. Somehow being deprived of the freedom to use the bathroom when I wanted to drive me crazy. Inevitably every time she would go in there, I would have to pee! Granted she was taking a shower and doing her hair and makeup while listening to podcasts so it was taking a WHILE! \n\nShe ended up asking me if I wanted to use it before being in there for a while and that was great. \n\nSo I say it is probably just his being used to having free run of it", "I hadn\u2019t thought of it\u2014the camera is certainly an answer. It also could be that he has some kind of OCD issues where he hast to get his stuff done first because he doesn\u2019t wanna go behind somebody or it could be a control thing.\n\nNo matter what, you\u2019ve learned something so don\u2019t stay with him again. No matter what the reason is it\u2019s all creepy.", "He 100% has a secret camera in there to spy on you that he turns on before you go in.", "I thought perhaps he just wanted to make sure the bathroom was clean. I\u2019m OCD this way with guests, although I do just say, \u201cLet me pop in there and make sure it has everything you need.\u201d I do not make the excuse that I need to go/use the bathroom myself.", "NTA, bro is kinda strange. Update us if you ever figure out what he\u2019s hiding", "Everybody below has focused on the possibility of cameras. I'm going to discount that ... in today's tech world, I don't think you'd have to be constantly turning cameras on and off. I think a peeper would  just leave them running.\n\nSo, I'm actually going with YTA.  Your friend, who was kind enough to host you at his home, was acting oddly in terms of bathroom usage. I'm guessing he has OCD, or some type of bladder/bowel issue that makes him want to make sure he is \"empty\" when he won't have access to the bathroom, even for a short while. I don't know that I'm right about this, but your anger and snapping seems OTT for this situation.", "He has a prostate issue", "Same \ud83e\udd23\n\n\"All I wanted was to brush his teeth! Why am I the a-hole?\"\n\n NTA", "Me too!", "You can also use the front facing camera of a more recent iPhone, because it can detect IR emitters, and these types of cameras may be showing that.", "She was saying they had their argument on her last day there.", "I\u2019m so naive. I didn\u2019t think this at all.", "Omg! I am so naive I didn\u2019t even think about that", "It\u2019s scary to me that this didn\u2019t even cross my mind", "I was all set to say that in the instance with brushing his teeth, it is not unreasonable that he brushes first. In all the other instances, he could be a germaphobe. NOW, I think this guy is a perv! Hate to say, but it makes WAY more sense that he was turning on a camera. You'd know if the guy was germaphobe. In fact, you'd probably not be allowed to stay if he was that bad. NTA", "That's exactly where my head went first. Way too shady.", "My first thought too. I hope OP updates us.", "Oh god.", "Exactly what I'm thinking! OP, I'd take a look around in there.", "Only thought he was misogynistic, but that is indeed (sadly) a possibility.", "These cameras don't run all the time?  You need to turn them on each time?", "He is turning on a hidden camera. He is not your friend.", "Never thought of this but it makes so much sense!", "Ofc reddit would go there.", "My brain definitely went here first.. unfortunately", "Every time? Wouldn't he then just turn it on before the visit and record the whole time? Maybe back then when video tapes were used, but nowadays?", "Or the guy wants to make sure his bathroom is clean before a guest uses it. One of the two.", "Oh thank you! I came to say this. thought maybe I\u2019m just distrusting of people or watch too many crime shows. But it\u2019s a real possibility.  Isn\u2019t there a way to use your phone to check for hidden cameras? Be cautious op.", "Most cameras can be turned on from your phone or computer, though. I have several (not hidden, because I'm not a creep).", "This was my first thought too oof I hope it isn't this", "That was the first thing that came to mind. What else could it be?", "Yep! Exactly where my mind went, too!", "Oh shit", "Came here to say this \ud83d\ude14", "My thoughts exactly went straight to this possibility.", "Came here to say just this \u2026", "My mind went to the same place. Fishy indeed.", "All the red flags raised because of this.", "Yiiiikes \u2026", "Excellent.  I'd get outta there.  Known him long? How was it when he visited u?", "THIS was the first thing I had to think about", "First thing I thought of tbh maybe the world has me jaded af", "This is what I came to say.", "First thing I thought too", "The fact he gets defensive is interesting.", "Humans are horrible savages. This was the first thought I had when hearing the situation.", "My immediate thought too.", "Damnit you beat me to it.", "Ha! I told myself I would actually be surprised if the top comment would *not* suggest this. Especially as that's the first thing my mind snapped to.\n\nNTA, OP. You were being recorded by this perverted Arsehole.", "This.\n\nThought it as soon as I\u2019d read the first sentence.", "first thing i thought of. very suspicious behaviour.", "*I know someone who did this.* \n\nHe's *FAMILY*.\n\nI would bet $5 that he was doing exactly this.", "That is indeed suspicious. She's NTA, but my quess is that he's having a hard time respecting the 'platonic' part.", "i couldn't put my finger on what it was exactly, but i was like \"he's up to no good, he's doing something in there before she's goes in\" i think you could be right", "My first thought as well.", "Holy shit I would\u2019ve never thought of this but wowwwwww", "I didn\u2019t think hidden camera but definitely thought he\u2019s doing something.", "OOOOMMMIIIIGGGOOODDD!!!!! I didn\u2019t even think of this!!", "*Thought I had to go, but turns out it was just gas.*\nThanks for morning laugh!\n\nOP I\u2019m sorry but your friend sounds sketch. Obviously NTA but I wouldn\u2019t stay there any longer.", "Yeah, me too, like when he comes back from brushing just say don't worry, i will use the shower later and repeat it every half hour till he has no teeth anymore from all the brushing :)", "Ugh my kids do this. As soon as my son says he\u2019s going to the bathroom suddenly my daughter has to go and will run in front of him to get there first \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f then my son, who actually HAS to go, has to go to the upstairs bathroom instead of the one closest to him.", "I understand that, i would be panicking the bathrooms was messy.", "He's got a house guest, he could just check the  bathroom before he leaves.", "I also have bad interoception so it often takes someone else going to the bathroom for me to realise I've actually needed to go for a while, so I would give him the benefit of the doubt for like half the instances, but literally every single time?! That's getting into something even weirder territory...", "As someone with OCD, that does sound plausible. He could have intrusive thoughts telling him if he goes second he won't get to go, it'll be too dirty, or anything else. Suss behaviour but not necessarily a camera.", "Yes, for me it sounds like OCD. There is no reason for him to constantly turn a camera on and off. Every time. It makes no sense. Just let them camera run no?", "Something like ADHD could be the culprit too.\n\nI will need to do something like use the bathroom, get focused on a conversation or whatever, then forget until I'm reminded. Someone saying, \"I have to use the bathroom\" to me after we've been talking for an hour would remind me that bathrooms exist and I've needed to use one this whole time.\n\nI'd just go outside, but I live in the woods and that's not an option for everyone.", "Ya if I'm staying with someone who only has one bathroom I always give a heads up before I take a shower. Doesn't seem odd to me. You're right though, if it's every time that's kinda strange.", "i thought that, but every time?? sounds more like he\u2019s putting something in there", "That was my initial impression, but that's because that's what I do. I have anxiety about not having access to my bathroom and I'm always worried it's not presentable.", "My husband and I shared an apartment with another couple for a year, and they were like this too. Without fail, no one would be in the bathroom for a while, but as SOON as I got in there they were checking every two minutes to see if I was out yet and would rush in right when I got out. The best one was when we were going to the beach and they took an hour in the bathroom, then when it was my turn they freaked out that it might rain and that I only had five minutes... I don't miss them.", "Right?\n\nSeeing all the comments before this one has had me royally confused.\n\nI'm like sometimes people suddenly are reminded of things? I sometimes don't even realize I'm hungry until I see someone eating lol", "I need to scroll too much down to find this. It's better than the psicokiller with hidden cam or checking if the corpse under the shower is still there.", "Absolutely. This doesn\u2019t seem weird to me at all.", ">nobody wants to brush their teeth in the green mist \ud83e\udd22\n\noh I did not need to read that", "This is what we really need to know. Is there a quick duck back in after op is done.. she's gone quiet tho :/", "Not in this day and age.\n\nIt could be a friend you met dating, but transitioned to friends. \n\nIt could be a friends w/benefits situation. \n\nIt could be a friend you used to hook up with, but don't any more. \n\nPresumably, yes, a friend is someone you haven't had sex with and won't have sex with, but it never hurts to clarify that.", "Yes. Rich people have a separate room for their shitters but us common folk can hit the toilet from the tub", "Why aren't you replying to people suggesting he's turning on a camera?", "This guy is a creep. Don\u2019t stay there.", "Oh geeze, I didn't even think of this just what a weird man. NTA and I would definitely refrain from ever staying at this guy's place again. Hey OP were there any other strange behaviors from this guy, things that gave you pause?", "Might be the one inconvenience of having a guest is a single bathroom, so it would totally make sense to me if he told himself he can just go before her quickly and avoid that annoyance.", "That might not even be needed. It might stop recording automatically after 5-15 minutes or so.", "Me neither, far out!", "No,  you're sane.", "But why couldn\u2019t the camera be on all the time?", "Surely in this age of technology you wouldn't need to physically activate a camera?", "It's certainly possible, but to just declare that it's unequivocally the answer is a bit of a stretch, don't you think?", "This thought was mine first", "Yeah, he'd also just turn it on from his phone.", "Yeah, he'd also just turn it on from his phone.", "Every time she needs to use it though? It\u2019s not like she just went to use it once, and half the time she gets up to go she was probably the last to use it anyway since he always insists on going first!", "every time?", "For night routine, maybe.\n\nBut if he's doing this every time, throughout the day? Like jumping up if she has to take a piss? That's not a longer routine issue.", "I'd get that the first time, maybe, but every time? If so then that's a seriously unhealthy issue that he needs to address. At base level he should also have been able to say that to her instead of accusing her of being a bad guest when she gets frustrated and asks him why he's doing this.", "Every time though? Throughout multiple days?", "I don't have OCD but I do have a bathroom hangup. If I feel even the faintest sensation of my bladder not being completely empty, I can't sleep. Because of this I always go to the bathroom right before heading for bed. If I go to the bathroom and then scroll on my phone in bed for 20 minutes I'll have to go again, so if by that time someone else is the bathroom... guess I can't go to sleep yet.\n\nSomething similar to this could explain why he doesn't go *before* the moment they both decide to go to bed.", "Or OP is an unreliable narrator and she's taking *way longer* than the 10 minutes that she claims.\n\nIt would be more common for an OP of aita to minimize to make themselves look better, than for a friend to set up a camera every time their houseguest goes to the bathroom. I mean, it's possible, but I think it's likely that OP is underestimating how long she's taking. Maybe she's in shower for 10 minutes, but doing her skincare routine for another 15, drying her hair for 15, etc. and all that adds up.", "Personally, I'd feel like if that was the case then when it's brought to your attention the guest feels uncomfortable because they don't understand why it's every time - surely you'd (generic you, not you specifically) apologise, explain, and maybe sort something out or just wait for them to come back next time to give them a breather? If you respect your guest that is\n\nEdit: spelling", "Hahaha, I apologise, well sort of lol.", "Dealing with a situation like this can be uncomfortable for people, she may feel violated. I understand why she\u2019s not answering people that mention a camera 100%", "Oh....that's why", "Because most people don't like to be confronted with the possibility that they've been violated by someone they trust.\n\nEdit: For the record, I also have suspicions he was turning on a camera.", "maybe because there's literally hundreds of them? lol", "My thought too!", "Storage, having to speed through your dumps so you can be a perv. Probably a turn off", "He\u2019s probably cheap and only has a shitty one", "If it's a small cheap one, low battery and memory", "Tons of unnecessary footage. He wants to capture just the good bits. He probably thought he would lie his way out of any suspicion.", "True unless he wanted no digital or network footprint or they only had an old camera. \n\nThey busted a guy at a company I used to work at for  child porn. He had 10s of 1000s of videos and pictures on vhs, cdroms, dvds, SD cards, and air gabbed hard drives. He got caught because he used the company internet to sell/share/buy content. \n\nWe were a finance company that would get unannounced inspections from SEC and other government agencies as well as corporations we represented like ING or Wells Fargo. Only the head compliance guy and owners would know they were getting inspected. \n\nOne day, we got raided by the FBI full on swat. They took all our hardrives and him roughly out of the office while we watched from the parking lot. They searched all our cars and confiscated our blackberries. This was 2009. During his trial, he said that the \"culture\" preferred old school media for this reason, he just got impatient for new content. He got 24 years. \n\nSo that could be why.", "Exactly. I have security cameras in my house. I can turn them on and off from my phone.", "I guess it depends on if you\u2019re a wealthy perv or not", "Reddit loves authoritative declarations.", "No.", "Bunch of people in this thread seem pretty dead set on a hidden camera. There are plenty of normal explanations for why he might want to use the bathroom first (the main one being exactly what he said: she takes longer than he does, and he's impatient.) Looking at a single annoying habit and jumping straight to \"he's probably a sex offender\" is an an insane level of paranoia. If OP values this friendship at all I hope she takes this with healthy amount of salt.", "To be fair everyone else here seems very sure that it IS a camera with basically no evidence", "It was his system and he got stuck on it\u2026just sayin\u2019 the simplest answer is usually it. \n\nWhy would anyone plant a camera they have to manually setup? Smdh that\u2019s just so obvious and out there. Wouldn\u2019t a tech perv get a sensor or battery in the thing in this day and age?", "Yep, the defensiveness and attack are \ud83d\udea9", "that\u2019s super true for the showering incidents, but op says it\u2019s every single time! agree on unreliable narrator but at face value this still\nseems super weird to treat your guest like this", "I absolutely agree. I would be in meltdown mode surely, as many ppl say it wasn't their first thought. Poor kid..", "True but it's a possibility that she should look into.  That's not a thing to ignore.  So hopefully she's proactive in her health and safety.", "Because she probably has no intention of ever going back there. He may become violent if confronted.", "So?  All it takes is one reply.", "You likely dont have tiny, hidden cameras", "No we, collectively, dont.", "What an authoritative declaration on our behalf.", "If I've told you once, I've told you a billion times, don't exaggerate.", "Yes it is.  Most people aren't degenerate creeps.", "And he's not turned on.", "I was thinking that why not leave it on the only thing I could think is he doesn't want his routine or bathroom habits recorded if that's what hes doing. But it could be a routine thing and he probably shouldn't have the overnight guest. She should of stayed in a hotel maybe", "100%. Regardless of what's going on, this guy's vibes are way off.", "It\u2019s true. Redditors never make broad statements", "HA! I see what you did there.", "But this situation reeks of degenerate creep activity", "You know literally one thing about this guy (an annoying habit) and you're jumping to \"this guy's vibes are way off\"?", "Does it?  They're friends.  You're not only making assumptions about him, you're making assumptions about her situational awareness.  Maybe he's just weird.  Maybe she's exaggerating.  Maybe he's making sure he remembered to flush.\n\nAgain, I'm not discounting the possibility.  She should absolutely consider it.  But saying, \"yup, there's definitely a camera, 100%\" is just ridiculous", "In this context? I absolutely am. It's the internet, and neither of us matter. Bonus, I now know an annoying habit of yours, too!\n\nHave a good fish."]}
