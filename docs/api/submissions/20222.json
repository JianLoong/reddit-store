You're way nicer than me. I would have started messing with him, like oops, changed my mind, I'll shower in the morning!

Sometimes you don\u2019t realize you have to go until the other person is going. As a courtesy I usually announce I\u2019ll be using the bathroom 5 min or so before I need to do so.", "Camera was the first thing I thought of.", "He sounds odd, or perhaps a  germaphobe so he doesn't want girl cooties???? That being said, it is his house. Why would you make an issue out of it?", "ESH\n\nHonestly, you're staying in somebody's house (I assume for free) and this is your biggest complaint?\n\nAnd as for him, clearly an overly 'stuck in his ways' kind of guy - but guess what? It's his place.\n\nHot tip, if you can't deal with random annoying shit like this, don't stay at other people's houses.", "YTA. You were only there for two days! How many times could this have happened? Twice? You should have kept your mouth shut.", "YTA - he's probably used to having the bathroom to himself and using it whenever he wants to, but now maybe sees it being occupied longer than he would have expected so decided to finish off his routine. Don't see anything wrong with it, inconvenience sure, but it's just minor", "YTA, Maybe he worries that you'll go #2 and stink up the place, maybe you going to the bathroom reminds him of what he needs to do there too, or maybe the room is too warm after you take a shower. Either way he's the host so if he wants to go first he should be able to.\n\nAlso the fact that you specified \"platonic\" makes me believe that it's in fact not platonic.", "yes you are", "NTA", "NTA\n\nMy first thought was that he had a camera hidden in there.", "I honestly think it strange you noticed this after only 2 days and would  even mention it....truly not sure what the issue is", "kinda the AH but not really?  Sharing spaces is tough.  You're a guest.  I'd take note of it and keep it in mind if you ever considered staying with him again.", "Oh, that's REALLY weird. I see there's a lot of speculation about a camera, I would vote for some form of OCD. There is something going on that he wants to keep a secret, and OCD seems to fit the bill.\nNTA", "Nta - and how bizarre.Like another commenter said, was he turning on a hidden camera or something. Like ew.", "Ha. Realizing that the title can be read that way but absolutely no desire to do that!", "Glad I wasn\u2019t the only one to misread it \ud83d\ude02", "This is where my mind went immediately. Once or twice in a visit I could see, but every time? I wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s a coincidence.", "Same. This is  where my thoughts went too...", "Didn\u2019t think of this prior to your sentence but you could be right.\n\nIt\u2019s just so odd that he always tries to go before. OP needs to say if he sneaks back after her.", "Oh Jesus that makes so much sense", "Yep. There's a camera in there. OP needs to find out for sure.", "This is 100% what was happening.", "Exactly my thoughts", "Oh shit.", "I thought this too, OP don\u2019t stay here long just in case. He could also be a germaphobe, is there any signs of that?", "That was my first thought too", "No.\n\nI think the simpler answer is he probably realized her routine is longer than his and if he isn\u2019t going to have company (and the evening is over), to go first.\n\nMight be the one inconvenience of having a guest is a single bathroom, so it would totally make sense to me if he told himself he can just go before her quickly and avoid that annoyance.\n\nOP, YTA for making it a thing imho. I\u2019d totally get him. When I lived with roommates in a single bathroom apartment, I\u2019d generally tell people I\u2019m about to shower/hold up the bathroom in case anyone wants to go first. Idk why people read into this anymore than that\u2026?", "Exactly what I was thinking.", "Exactly what I thought", "That was my first thought", "Thats where my brain went immediately", "You should probably see a doctor if you only go to the toilet once a day", "I'm sorry, but how do you know it's completely impossible he's turning on a camera? You seem very sure of yourself", "If he reacted like this once or twice, sure. But jumping to the bathroom each time? It's really weird.\nThis said it doesn't have to be a camera. It could be some form of OCD.", "He's the camera"]}
