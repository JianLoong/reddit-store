He jumped up and said he would brush his teeth first so that he could go to bed without waiting for me to shower.

Will think this through and see how to proceed.\n\nWould also like to address the better-case (or at least what I really hope it is) scenario of him having \u201chabits\u201d or \u201cremembering that he has to go too.\u201d This would maybe make sense once in the last example I gave (knowing someone will take longer to shower and quickly running in to brush teeth) but the fact that it happened every time is showing that to him whatever I need to do in the bathroom is ALWAYS less important than what he needs to do in there. Some people have been saying that the guest isn\u2019t right to dictate how someone should act in their own home and while I agree with this overall (that\u2019s why I said nothing for a day) I would have definitely not gone before the guest unless it was a major emergency if the roles were reversed.

Tell him well in advance that you'll be showering in 30 mins, see if he goes right before you had intended to shower or if he goes immediately when you say. Then change your mind and don't shower, you're too tired and will do it in the morning. Watch to see if he goes back to the bathroom. If he does, he's doing something before you go in there - as others have said, possibly turning on a hidden camera.\n\nIf you have any time alone there, go and look around for one. Maybe turn the light off and use a torch to look for a reflection on a tiny lens. Check anywhere that would have a direct(ish) view on the shower, toilet or where you'd normally get changed. Look for anything where a screw or nail might normally be.", "In the last scenario you were both talking on the couch before bed. I'm assuming you both were going right to bed after.

This instance on its own doesn't seem like weird asshole behavior to me. \n\nThe fact you're seeing a pattern might be weird, but it's hard to say. I certainly wouldn't jump to the hidden camera conclusion. Maybe there's a bit of OCD or general concern about you going in the bathroom and it not being clean/presentable? I could see that being the case, especially with an older man who's not used to living with a woman. I feel like I'd need more info.", "INFO - when you say everytime is it literally everytime (like when you need the toilet as well) or just everytime you want to shower? \n\nIf its literally everytime then yeah that's a bit odd and questionable. Not sure I'd jump straight to something as creepy as a camera if this is the only odd thing he's doing but still.\n\nIf we're talking just when you shower though then I'd consider that fine and normal. I've always asked people if they need to use the bathroom for any reason if I'm about to shower when with family or staying at friends, but that's always because if I don't someone will knock halfway through to rush me because they need it.", "I mean it could be something nefarious. Or it could be that he had no reason to brush his teeth for bed while he was sitting on the couch chatting with somebody for over an hour.", "NTA I had a roommate like this \u2014 she didn\u2019t have any interest in the bathroom until I wanted to use it, would rush to beat me to it if she saw me headed that way or would knock on the door to use the toilet once I was 2 minutes into a short shower.\n\nYeah, some people can be really weird about using bathrooms.", "NAH:\nHe wanted to brush his teeth because his friend was going to bed and he didn't need to host you.\n\nHe wanted to go first because he felt you would take too long.", "How does a camera make any sense? You surely wouldn't have to turn it on and then off again everytime.\n\nI now this situation from a past relationship. If one of us needed to do big business or shower the other one would quickly jump to the bathroom before for a pee.", "Meh, I see both sides. NAH\n\nI am guilty of that myself sometimes. I know that I have to brush my teeth, but it feels like I have plenty of time to do it so there\u2019s no rush. When someone announces they\u2019re going to the bathroom for whatever reason, it gives me a sense of, IDK, urgency? Scarcity? I realize that the bathroom isn\u2019t going to be available for a while and that I\u2019ll have to wait for it to be free again no matter how long that might take, which may or may not cause me issues down the line. Since brushing one\u2019s teeth is much quicker than a shower, it seems logical to do it first. \n\nIs it possible he has a camera in there? Sure, but it\u2019s a stretch. I would give him the benefit of the doubt, unless he tends to be a creep in general. \n\nI totally understand why it\u2019s annoying for you and where you\u2019re coming from though! You\u2019re not in the wrong because it rubs you the wrong way!\n\nWith my family and friends, we usually ask if anyone needs to use the bathroom quick (like number one or teeth brushing) beforehand if we plan on being in it for more than five minutes. That way, everyone gets everything done and the ones who need the bathroom longer aren\u2019t in a rush. You could start asking \u201cdo you need the bathroom?\u201d and see what he says. \n\nOr, if you are really worried he might be doing something creepy, you could leave his toothbrush and toothpaste on the table or somewhere like that so he can brush his teeth using the kitchen sink. That way, he can do his thing and you can still protect yourself.", "Does he have some sort of anxiety? Maybe he's having a panic of \"oh god did I flush/clean up\" whenever you headed towards the loo?\n\nOr he's some sort of closet misogynist who's convinced all women spend forever in the bathroom making themselves look good?\n\nThe other comments regarding a camera are unfortunately something you need to consider as well, no matter how well you think you know him.\n\nI'm curious how often you were needing the bathroom for it to be such a big issue by day 2 though! I can understand if you were staying longer you snapping at him, but staying for a weekend on the face of it I don't quite see why it was such an annoyance to you, unless he was acting really shady each time", "I'm wondering if he has a camera hidden in the bathroom. I'd look for one. Don't stay there again.", "People with IBS can have a sudden urge for bowel movement due to the stress not able to use the toilet.\nMaybe he has some bowel issue?", "NAH, leaning towards a light Y-T-A. I say this because I've lived with someone who has a tendency to take ages in the bathroom so I get where he's coming from. It's annoying when you have to do something that only takes a minute but you can't do it because you have to wait for someone else to do something that takes significantly longer -- and until then you can't go to sleep. These days she usually just lets me go first.\n\nThe reason he's deciding to go to bed right when you do is because you guys were spending time together. When you leave, that automatically ends, so in his mind there probably is no reason to just... stay behind and lounge on the couch alone. Bedtime it is.\n\nThe people jumping to a hidden camera are ~~insane~~ pretty on brand for this place. I prefer to take the occam's razor approach and say he's likely just impatient.", "I had a similar situation with my sister in law, staying in a small apartment. Every single time I got up to go to the bathroom she\u2019d ask if it was ok to pop ahead of me. Every. Single. Time.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell me this but I know she was on her period. However I myself was heavily pregnant and not once had I spent a long time in there. It really really began to fuck me off. Seems like every time I mentioned it, it would remind her that she had this terrible urgent issue and must take the opportunity to sort it while she could. \n\nIn the end I realised it was pretty simple: I stopped telling anyone I was going to use the bathroom and just did it. Problem solved. \n\nCamera idea hadn\u2019t occurred to me but it does seem worth investigating too.", "NTA, but it may not be anything strange from his point of view. My dad has a similar habit - he tends to forget that he needs to go to the bathroom and seeing someone else getting up reminds him that he needs to go NOW. Que some really absurd situations. Super annoying but what can you do.", "NTA. But don't crucify the guy because my missus does the same, we will be in bed together for an hour looking at our phones and the second I say I am going to the toilet that reminds her she 'needs the toilet'. You are staying with him for a couple of days so grin and bear the adhd(or creepy) idiot.", "For that particular case you were a bit of an asshole because brushing teeth takes a lot less than showering and maybe he was enjoying the moment while you were chatting and not even thinking of going to bed. \n\nThe other times \u2026 hm I\u2019m torn between him being one of those jackass men who only know stereotypes about women \u2026 like they take long to get ready\u2026 or that he\u2019s a creep and as someone else said in the comments, was turning on a hidden camera\u2026 \nHe might also be quite fastidious and wanted to make sure everything was clean before you went in. But I haven\u2019t seen many men like that in real life.", "NTA. Don\u2019t stay with him anymore. He may be putting in a camera to spy on you. This is weird behavior.", "He wasn\u2019t brushing his teeth, he was adjusting the camera before secretly filming you. NTA.", "Girl he\u2019s got a camera in that bathroom. Bet he also pops back in there after you\u2019re done showering also, right? He\u2019s gotta go get his camera back", "Am I the only one who thought it was weird to write platonic before friend? Ain't the word friend already platonic?", "Hidden camera", "NTA not good host and definitely wouldn't stay with him. Classic male trying to say your taking long when in fact your being courteous of the bathroom usage. Now if he takes long to brush I would start to assume he is doing something to the bathroom.", "NTA but if you're gonna shower at someone else's house give them a heads up so they can pee first. They shouldn't have to race you. Be considerate.", "NTA he\u2019s either got some mental issues or\u2026.he needs to reset the camera he\u2019s got in his bathroom to get better shots of you.", "NTA: Find the camera. It's there.\n\nEdit: downvote away. There's a camera in that room and OP needs to find it.", "YTA. Yes, the only reason he was staying up was to talk to you so why would you expect him to stay up and just sit there without you? You want to shower and get ready for bed that takes 10-15 minutes, he wants to brush his teeth that takes 3 minutes. It's also his house and you're a guest. Just let him go first! In fact, if you know this bothers him, you should be saying things like \"In 15 minutes, I'm going to go shower\" so you give him a 15 minute window to do his business rather than hold the only bathroom hostage.  \n\n\nEdit: I didn't think of the video camera thing. That's quite the accusation but I guess it comes down to whether or not this actually happened every time you went to the bathroom or just most times when you announced you were having a shower. If it's the former, did you really announce that you were going to use the bathroom just for a pee? If so, why? Anyways, much more sinister and weird than I could ever imagine. How much do you trust this guy?", "I don\u2019t know why it upsets you that he wanted to brush his teeth quickly. Seeing as you were both going to bed, it means that he could do them and go straight to sleep - if you\u2019re showering etc who knows how long you\u2019d take, and he\u2019d have to sit in bed waiting to brush his teeth until you\u2019re done. Sure if you\u2019d waited longer, he would have waited longer - because you were talking and it\u2019s usually the last thing people do before bed (especially if you have a set routine, or ocd). So your \u2018I\u2019m going to shower before bed\u2019 signalled it\u2019s time to sleep, and he wanted to take two mins to not wait however long you\u2019d take. \n\nYTA for snapping. It\u2019s annoying if it\u2019s becoming a pattern that he always goes before you, but it\u2019s been one day\u2026 you\u2019re a guest and waiting for him to go first (quite possibly some sort of ocd or panic about not being able to pee when you\u2019re in there) is not such a big deal that you snap like this. He\u2019s your friend, have some patience?\n\nThen there is that scary possibility he is setting up a camera, which I\u2019ve read from the comments. Hope it\u2019s not that \ud83d\ude29", "Bro he didn't wanna wait 40 mins to brush his teeth when he could just do it now. Why he picked that exact moment? Probably because you guys just finished the conversation and it was time to hit the bed. You overreacting here but I can't speak on the previous incidents", "Is he just getting up to turn on the hidden camera?\n\nJust a thought. NTA.", "Honestly, first thought is there's a hidden camera. I'd look for it. NTA", "Call the police, tell them your story and that you suspect you were filmed without your permission. If anything at worst they'll have it on record and best case they'll find the camera in there and put that creep in prison.", "I'm curious, is it very common where you all live to have the toilet and shower in the same room?", "My innocent take would be that he, like me, hates that somebody (even worse if a girl) would see crap laying around in his bathroom, hairs, toothpaste stains in the sink, dirty mirror, dirty toilets ?\n\nThen the worst case, he turns on a camera or sum as everybody said", "I hope it's not a camera situation, but I also do this when my friends visit because I sometimes don't flush after peeing (I drink a ton), I do a quick check to make sure my bathroom is clean, and I also have bathroom anxiety. My FWB will take full hour poops and if he doesn't give me a heads up and I already have to pee, I can be very anxious and uncomfortable. The thought of not having constant access to my bathroom gives me anxiety, especially after I fostered a cat who wouldn't let me in my own bathroom for a week. I could see this going in an innocent or not so innocent direction, so I can't really vote.", "NTA and please don't stay with him again. Whatever is going on is not a good situation.\n\nAlso? As someone who sometimes gets so engrossed in whatever I'm doing that I usually HAVE to use the restroom when I get up to use the restroom, the first time he stopped me from going, I'd have been miserable... and I'd have grabbed my bags and checked into a hotel.", "YTA, have some consideration. It obviously takes way less time to brush your teeth than to take a shower. Dont feel too bad, living with someone is a learned skill and it takes a little practice.", "YTA. It's his place. Yes, it's annoying, but my BF is a bathroom hog, and it just makes good sense to pee or brush my teeth before he gets settled in.", "I'm getting..creepy perv vibes. Before you DO shower, check for cameras. Every outlet, the mirror, the light sockets and if there's a vent better check that too. \n\nTry not announcing your bathroom trips if he gets pissed abaout it I'd be very suspicious", "It seems very strange.  You are NTA at all.", "Gonna say NAH\n\nIf you look at it from his perspective, he is planning on going to bed but has to wait 10 minutes for you to shower, he likely doesn't have anything to do that takes less than 10 minutes\n\nLet him know when you are planning on doing things in advance, it won't make too big a difference to you", "YTA. It makes sense to me that he asked to grab his toothbrush before you went in the bathroom so that he could brush his teeth and go to sleep without having to wait for you to come out of the shower. That way he could already be asleep by the time you come out.\n\nThis doesn't come up with a roommate because it's free for all in using the bathroom, but if you're with a guest you probably hang out which means you end up having the same schedule (such as going to sleep once you go to sleep) which can explain why he uses the bathroom at the same time (such as bedtime routine). He probably just wanted to get out of your hair and go to bed and let you take as much time as you want to shower without having to worry that he needs his toothbrush.", "NTA. Sounds like a creeper. Who is setting up the camera. Don\u2019t stay there.", "Doesn\u2019t want to be sitting around waiting to use the bathroom if everyone is going to bed after. \n\nWants to get in first then go to sleep.", "YTA  \n\n\nof course he would have stayed on the couch.

No hidden cameras.", "Now is the time to take that hour long \"shower\" and search that bathroom", "Everyone immediately deciding he is a creep. While that is possible, it could just as easily be him having adhd. (OP, be careful about possible hidden cam, just in case)", "NTA\n\nBut my brain did not go to the camera idea, i was thinking maybe he\u2019s ocd about his bathroom cleanliness and wanted to make sure it was clean before you used it.  lol Silly me.", "There is a hidden camera somewhere in there", "Spy cam.\n\nDon't return.\n\nNTA.\n\nBut he's been looking at . . .", "NTA his behavior is bizarre. I would also be kind of concerned there was a hidden camera in the bathroom that he was rushing to turn on to record since he always had to go in there before you. I would stay in a hotel next time you visit (if you do ever want to visit again.)", "NTA. All the people are pointing out he might be a peeve with a hidden camera", "NTA for getting upset. \n\nBut I am the same. If I was sat chatting with a friend and the only reason I was up was the conversation when they said they were going to shower and go to bed I would jump in first as taking a pee and brushing my teeth is quicker. No reason for me to sit on the couch waiting for them.", "I live with my girlfriend and she basically does the same thing to me haha", "Dude it sounds like he is recording you. He runs to the restroom right before you do? He is recording you in the restroom!", "There is a camera for sure.

She doesn\u2019t owe any of us any out-loud processing of unsettling thoughts/revelations, doesn\u2019t even owe us a coherent story (much as we\u2019d like one and that\u2019s what we\u2019re generally here for). \n\nNot to come down on you in particular too hard, everyone here acts like this, but think for a moment about what you\u2019re saying to another human and why:\n\nOP: [reveals something about her life/friendship]\n\nCommenters: \u201cYo this \u2018friend\u2019 could be a fuckin creep predator who\u2019s been filming you in the bathroom, whaddya think of that??\u201d\n\nOP: [processing this privately, or not, in whatever way they do]\n\nYou: \u201cAnswer us! *Whaddya think of that?!?*\u201d", "Maybe not since they had cameras. I have an SE Gen 3 and only the front facing shows the IR, not the rear cameras. That's why I specifically said the front facing.", "So the bathroom lamp has to be switched off to make te IR led light up", "Who hurt you?", "Ahahahaha yes, the poo-pourri is very prominently displayed in our bathroom. And we only have one so it\u2019s stressful with guests.", "It's shit like this that makes me think I had too good of a childhood. The camera thing wouldn't even cross my mind. I would just think, \"What a fuckin weirdo.\"", "I was thinking about this too. Like, what else is he doing? Ne careful, OP and leave asap!", "But he just happens to need to go *every time* she does, when\u2019s she\u2019s only in there a couple of minutes at a time? I don\u2019t blame OP for thinking it was a joke at first, it sounds like a bad skit", "Or he could grab his toothbrush and toothpaste and use the kitchen sink no?", "I have brothers and grew up sharing a single bathroom in a family of five. I would honestly be annoyed, but not surprised. I have been known to share the bathroom (boys and girls, oh my!) when we are all just brushing teeth or dealing with contact lenses.", "My thought was \"Oh god she's going to be in there for an hour. Better pee/brush my teeth/poop/shower now.\"", "Right, maybe he's moving his stuff? There was a segment on TV a while ago that talked about the \"frothy fecal fountain\" of germs caused by flushing the toilet and why you shouldn't leave your toothbrush on the counter near the toilet. I'll remember it for the rest of my life. That and the nematodes in sushi - haven't had a spicy tuna roll in the \\~15 since that segment.", "Yeah, camera is NOT where my mind went first. I have ADHD and IBS sometimes I have done this to guests. Her saying she needed a shower at night could have reminded him he needed to brush his teeth. Because of the simple association- the bathroom is where the toothbrush is stored. \n\nAlso, sometimes if people are gathering things for a shower I may ask to slip in the bathroom first because with IBS it can come on fast and it\u2019s better for them to have their shower delayed for 5 minutes than for me to have to bang on the door partway through their shower begging them to hurry because I need to get in ASAP.\n\nTwo days is also a relatively short sample size. How many times do you go to the bathroom during that time frame?\n\nI think that scenario or the guy subconsciously ascribing to some \u201cgirls take forever in the bathroom\u201d stereotype or wanting to make sure he didn\u2019t leave the bathroom a mess is far more likely than a hidden camera.", "It might be more common than you think. My ex husband used to do this to guests, back in the day of big clunky cameras.  He would run in and click it on and place in a laundry basket and wrap clothes around everything but the lens.  I found like ten tapes that spanned over a decade", "No no no. Not how it works. The explanation that allows for the highest amount of mistrust in men wins. In this case, the camera explanation is it.", "Correct. He \\*could\\* feel the need to straighten up the bathroom before she goes in. He \\*could\\* want to make sure his toothbrush is in a drawer so it's not exposed when she uses the toilet. He \\*could\\* be getting personally excited about the thought of her using the bathroom and taking care of it quickly. But if I were going to place a bet on why he is doing this, I'd bet on the camera. Sad but true.", "Granted, I have no idea if he did. But according to OP, this was not incidental, but *every single time* she needed to use the bathroom. To quote Lt. Aldo Raine: *Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English. It's called: sus-pic-ious.*\n\nBut still, thanks for calling me out. I thought I had jotted down she was *probably* being recorded. Meaning that I agree with your reaction, apart from the supposed improbability of the possibility. Because I myself consider it *extremely* likely.", "But every time? And always needing to go in first? That's annoying. Not saying it's a camera or something but it is inconsiderate and weird.", "But it doesn't explain his need to always go first. If anything, it might make him want to go last so he truly empties his bladder and can go to sleep.", "It's actually super common with neurodivergent people!", "Some people have poor interoception (ability to know when they need to eat or drink or use the bathroom). It\u2019s commonly associated with ADHD or autism.", "It's ok - I have to toughen up", "As someone who has no idea, why wouldn't the camera just be constantly rolling?", "That could be.  I never believe any of these but I like to interact.", "I have no idea what OP would do.  The camera is a possibility but hopefully that's not what he's doing.  There's shit ton of creeps so one never knows.  It's not a bogus suggestion.", "You are correct. Lots of modern rear facing cams have an IR filter and can\u2019t see the IR lights. But the front cams rarely include them. \n\nSource: it\u2019s the best way to tell if your roku remote\u2019s batteries are dead, or the roku TV froze browsing Netflix. Again.", "Not technically, it\u2019s just easier to see because the contrast will be so big.", "i mean, are you a dude? because dudes being weird towards their attracted-to-gender for nefarious reasons is such a common thing \ud83d\ude06", "I just thought maybe he wanted to check with the toilet was clean. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This was my thought as well", "Every single time, no matter what hes doing? Idkk", "It\u2019s hard to remain in the zone when having to fast forward.", "Storage? First thing I thought too.", "Even a cheap cam would be motion activated. They are <$30 on Amazon", "I hope he rotten in prison", "Yeah thats fucked up. It probably is more common then I think, but it is probably less common then a lot of people around here are making it sound. Some people are saying it 100% is what is happening and we have no way of knowing for sure. \n\nI think the main thing here is what would she even be able to do if she suspected it? She won't be able to prove anything (unless she finds a video of it somewhere) so really all she could do is end the friendship entirely. Only she can decide if that is the best course of action here or not.", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d say it\u2019s extremely likely, like what kind of logic are you using to deduce that? Just the fact it happened every time? Because there\u2019s many reasons I can imagine just off the top of my head to account for that, 1.) He could be some kind of germaphobe, 2.) He might have some kind of embarrassing bowel issue, or other medical issue, that might require him to use the bathroom suddenly, so maybe thought it was best to go before OP. 3.) Maybe it\u2019s just some psychological trauma, that causes him to not like using the bathroom so soon after someone else. 4.) It may just be a complete coincidence that he genuinely needed to go each time 5.) OP may genuinely take ages in the bathroom, and maybe be completely unaware, or ignorant to it 6.) OP could also be paranoid and exaggerating that it happened every single time\n\nSo those are just some fast ideas, that seem way more likely to me, sure, the camera thing is possible, but in this day and age, why would you manually have to switch it on? What are the odds of someone recording you in the bathroom as well, you have to be a pretty huge creep to do something like that, is it really that likely? I also think it\u2019s a dangerous thought to have, to believe the camera theory is fact, without definitive proof, potentially making OP\u2019s friend seem like a huge creep and stigmatising him with something for life. All just based on an idea?", "It does if he intends to go to sleep straight away. Otherwise he has to wait for her to go to sleep.", "People *are* frequently weird though, without necessarily being sinister.\n\nYou know the saying 'the past is a foreign country - they do things differently there'? It's exactly the same with staying in other people's homes in my experience.", "Just because she hasn\u2019t replied to all the comments about a camera doesn\u2019t mean she hasn\u2019t read them", "Cut down on the footage? It\u2019s way harder to browse through 24 hours of footage for maybe an hour total a day, spread out through 3-15 minute chunks.", "OP doesn't owe you a reply.", "Not the person you replied to but I am not a dude and this still did not at all occur to me.", "aint a dude but this didnt occur to me as well.", "Also not a dude and this never occurred to me", "But if he *always* goes first then if the toilet was dirty, it would be her fault not his and he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it.", "\ud83d\ude32", "He's rotten out of prison so I bet he will be rotten in it.", "Oh, he's had some run-ins with Bubba and the boys!", "I don't know, they seem pretty confident that their cameras are comparable.", "Hah, I see what you did there!", "\u2620\ufe0f", "I meant she shouldn't ignore the possibility.", "Okay but then people at least wouldn't get suspicious of you plus you can just take note of what time your guest went to the bathroom??! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You're right about that.", "I\u2019m a woman and I never would have thought of that either", "Only Siths deal in absolutes. Except me, dealing in absolutes to say that only Siths deal in absolutes, because I am not a Sith, even though I am dealing in absolutes.", "I don't think we're allowed to call them 'broads' anymore.", "I see what you did there!", "Not all cameras can hold that much footage either, so unless it\u2019s auto uploading to an online drive or something he might be worried about storage? also most people don\u2019t assume camera, we just think he\u2019s acting weird so while it\u2019s less suspicious, for that majority of people\u2026 suspicious of what? Just being a weirdo?", "Maybe it\u2019s his first creep voyeur rodeo", "Ahh the paradox of the sith", "All generalisations are false.", "How else do you refer to a skirt with nice gams?", "Hah, I like that bonus.
