But one of the tactics men like that use to control their victims is to isolate them from the people who love them. Don't make it too easy for him to set it up as \"it's me or them\".", "I told my sister that I disliked her live-in boyfriend that she had a child with.  He isolated her and took a lot of her money as well as strangled her until she fell to the floor holding her infant and eventually broke her arm.  I was the only one of her friends and family still speaking to her after he wouldn\u2019t let her go out and then she couldn\u2019t afford it because he had used all of her money (inheritance).  When he left her, she called me and I was the one there for her.  While she was with him, we made an agreement that we would talk about everything, but him because it would just lead to an argument.  Hope this helps.  I found (although everyone is different) that until she was ready to let him go there was nothing I could do except be there when the chips fell.  I was not ever supportive of their relationship and she knew it, but when it was over I was the one still there.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like he's a total smeghead.", "You\u2019re NTA strictly because you\u2019re coming from a place of concern (that\u2019s what it feels like).\n\nBUT..my advice, stop criticizing and start being there\u2026 if she\u2019s really gotten pregnant that quickly and given up her plans under his \u201cdirective\u201d or his strong desire for that and you\u2019re legitimately worried about her, make sure you\u2019re in a position to be there if things go south.\n\nWorst case he\u2019s controlling her and she\u2019s going to eventually need the support.\n\nBest case they\u2019re just crazy in love and he\u2019s putting her in a spot where she\u2019s free to be her true domestic goddess self.\n\nYou know you\u2019re sister, not a bunch of strangers. But either way, you\u2019re concerned and it\u2019s coming out aggressively..just take a step back, take a breath and make sure you\u2019re always there as a supportive, caring, NOT OVERBEARING sister. Seriously, she\u2019ll need you regardless so make sure she has you.", "INFO\n\nHas your sister expressed any desire to keep working?\n\nDoes she seem otherwise happy?\n\nYou may not like their life choices- but it is their life.", "NTA, but what did you hope to accomplish. Your job is to have her back when she needs you. Confronting her husband just means he\u2019ll try to keep her away from you.", "Light ESH, Mainly NTA\n\ni dont really get the YTAs here, if he really is a misogynist then you should use your words to fight back and put him in his place.\n\nTho here\u2019s the thing, if your sister really does want to be a stay at home mother, and is happy about it, then good for her. Feminism means that these roles in a house/family can be decided by women too, just not forced upon them. Wouldn\u2019t really call it brainwashing.", "NTA. This is a difficult one. From what you\u2019ve said he\u2019s stuck back in history where women had no rights. But at the same time your sister may truly want to be a stay at home mom. I certainly wanted to be. I am only 45. I believe in women\u2019s rights, that women can do anything they want to. But I also always wished to be a SAHM. So your hatred of him sounds deserved but you might want to back off your sister if she truly wants to be SAHM.", "I don\u2019t blame you. He sounds awful. NTA", "Just to be clear, there is nothing wrong with being a SAHM. I could never as I have fears of being financially dependent on someone; however, there is nothing wrong with it as long the sahp feels safe.\n\nAnyhow, you need to be careful with what you say as you don't want your sister to feel like she can't come to you.\n\nNTA but just be careful", "NTA, screw that guy", "Nta but she sounds like she's going to be baby trapped and financially abused. For your sake, and your sake only, you should keep contact but keep distant. You can still support her and be there for her when she will need it, but it going to be draining for you to be there listening to every call or cry she gives you. Hopefully soon, she will come to her senses and you can be there for her to help her get out of this situation, but, until then, it's clear she does not want help, and you can't force help onto people who don't want it. You have to wait until they realize they need to get away from the situation. \n\nMake clear boundaries with her, reiterate that you still love her, but you need space, then wait for the eventual fallout.", "Yta. He may have those views but she may agree with him. She may have always wanted to be a stay at home mom but went to college because she felt pressure from her over powering third wave feminist family. I am so tired of women putting other women down for wanting to be a stay at home mom.", "Um... so I don't think you are necessarily wrong for saying it. Because, frankly, if what you are saying is true and he is all of those things, your sister is about to embark on a horrible journey. Like, this just isn't going to go well at all. Idk what the people in these comments so far are smocking, but if what you are describing is going on, this dude does not have your sister's best interests at heart and she is about to throw her life away and basically tie herself to this man with a child. So somebody had to say something. \n\nLike yeah, sure, her life choices and all and maybe she is happy and what not, but somebody has to adress what this looks like and the very likely mess it will lead to. I mean Freya forbid something goes wrong with her pregnancy and she's got a pro forced birther for a husband.\n\nHowever, not only is your timing off - right after a pregnancy announcement. But your ending statement made the whole thing about YOU. And the fact thar YOU hate him and his views - I don't blame you - but that is not how to approach this. You need to squarely focus on the fact that the life trajectory he is putting her on is making her very vulnerable, very dependant, with no way out, and very little agency. You need to make it about HER and SHE is the one in trouble her and that you are worried about HER. And not about your own hatred for the man and his views.\n\nI know you kind of started there with your questions about what happens in the future, but you really should have made into a long heart to heart where you LET her defend him, and then rebutted her defence with examples and logic. This is a long game type of thing. \n\nYou also have to keep in mind that the person you are insulting - again even if its more of a description that insult - is someone who she loves regardless. And he may actually treat her well on the surface. A lot of these kind of men are romantics up until you actually hit the mysogeny wall. So you have to fight ba k against a completely different perception from what you are seeing and yelling and straight insults won't do that.\n\nSo I am giving you a YTA but not for \"going too far\" as you put it, but more for framing it in a selfish way rather than actually trying to help your sister see what she is getting herself into before she is in the deep end. The discussion needs to be had, but not in that way. As is you probably just gave her husband ammo yo use against you and your family to start isolating her.", "I'm with you! He is exactly what the world needs to be rid of! I hate him too!!", "NTA", "YTA:  Your sister just shared possibly the most exciting news she ever got to tell you.......and you made it into an argument about her husband.  \n\nI have no idea if what you said was true and needed to be said. But if it was, you chose the wrong time.", "YTA - It's fine for you to have your own views, and it's fine for you to not like him because of his views.  Not everyone is going to agree with you.  \n\nYou seem to have a big problem with your sister living her life the way she wants to, not the way you want her to.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong or mysoginostic about being a stay at home mom :/ \nBut I read some of your other comments and yeah that guy sounds like a piece of work.", "YTA. She\u2019s pregnant and crying because you\u2019re attacking the life choices she made. I\u2019m all for standing up to misogyny but you absolutely took it too far. Maybe she\u2019s been brainwashed, or maybe she\u2019s actually kind of excited to be a SAHM and she doesn\u2019t know how to say that to her judgmental sister. Wanting to stay at home with a baby \u2260 believing everything her husband believes.\n\nEdit: ESH. I noticed OP mentioned her sister calls crying about the husband all the time, and OP is using that as justification for saying the husband is emotionally abusive and controlling. Yet\u2026 OP\u2019s post literally says that she argued with her sister to the point where the sister is now crying to everyone else about OP. Sure, the husband is horrible, but OP went about this all wrong and will only further isolate her sister, during a pregnancy no less", "If your sister wants to get married and be a SAHM, she's allowed.

It is her life. She can decide what she wants to do. You don't get to force her to have a job anymore than she can force you to be a SATM.

She may WANT to stay home and be a mother. Women CAN want that.", "YTA, your views are yours, she is happy, you can't seem to accept her happiness because it's not what would make YOU happy. Let her live her life and live yours.", "YTA. This conversation would have been better served before they got married. Choosing to do this at a joyous event like a pregnancy annoucement was really inappropriate. She's married and pregnant...what do you expect her to do? Suddenly jump ship?

I mean one of your first thoughts about a new baby in your family was feminism \ud83d\ude06 If you keep acting like this, you will ruin your relationship with your sister and all future family gatherings will be awkward and uncomfortable. If this is her decision and she's happy, then be respectful of it and let her be happy.", "So you think that he's  all these horrible things. You think that because your sister doesn't fight back, she's brainwashed instead of agrees with her husband. Other people tell you that you went too far. Yes, YTA", "YTA. Even if you\u2019re right, it was the wrong time and wrong place.", "YTA;\n\nRegardless of if you dislike her husband and how they choose to live their lives, that\u2019s their choice. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t want your sister/her husband to force their views and life choices on you.", "YTA it sounds like your sister chose this man and wasn't forced into this marriage so this is obviously something that she's okay with.

Maybe once he has a daughter all his views will change", "YTA... there's nothing wrong with being a housewife and traditional gender roles.

I don\u2019t think that she will leave him purely because you told her to, especially now that she\u2019s pregnant. Most people in controlling or abusive situations just get angry at the person telling them it\u2019s wrong. So you need to think practically about how to realistically help her. \n\nI think you could try an approach of suggesting that she should have a decent amount of money saved independent of him \u201cincase something happens to him\u201d (aka, incase she ever wants to leave). You could also try to suggest that she does that by considering some kind of part time job or work from home to get that money. She could run a store on etsy, for example. Or even take a course online while at home, which she could do as she will have spare time now. I would try to use the angle that this would help her raise her child, as being more educated can only aid that. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he expects her to homeschool. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are resources that would be more helplful than me, but that\u2019s what came to mind.

It\u2019s a tough line to walk.\n\nI\u2019d say something like, \u201cI really love you and I\u2019m worried for you and the child. Your husband\u2019s views are pretty extreme and most people would be concerned by them. If you want to distance yourself, I get it, but please be wary of isolating yourself from a family support system too much. If you ever need a safe place to run to, I can be that place.

I\u2019ve had to leave an event and go to a second location with others to compare abusive behavior we\u2019d each witnessed separately and at this event and discuss how to proceed with a friend in danger. \n\nHe was well aware that we despised him - and she thought she was hiding everything so well - so we took *pains* to stay in contact, get her out of the house, agree with her when she expressed doubt but let her come to the next and final step on her own time. She was fully moved out within 12 hours of break up and calling us, and part of that was because we were sleeping when it went down. \n\nYou absolutely cannot play into those people\u2019s hands when they\u2019re chipping away at your loved one\u2019s self esteem and isolating them from their support system. You have to be willing to play the long game. Especially when there is a kid involved. You don\u2019t have to be supportive of the relationship, you can agree to disagree on it, but if you love and want to help your sister, you can\u2019t go scorched earth.

Put yourself in your sister's shoes - you are telling her you don't support her life choices, and quite forcefully at that, so in the future when she wants a supportive presence she is less likely to want to come to you. You are trying to control her (helicopter sister?), and it is sure to drive a wedge into the relationship.

When I was in middle school I told a teacher I wanted to be a mom when I grew up and was told \u201cthat\u2019s not a real job\u201d, shamed, and told to get real goals and aspirations. This was reinforced many times over the years by many teachers so I gradually started saying I wanted to pursue this or that degree for whatever career. My heart was never in it, but if I said what I really wanted I was told my true desires for my life were flat out wrong. I eventually just picked a career I thought would be closest to being a mom and went with it.\n\nSo I did \u201cfollow those goals\u201d. I went to a rigorous high school for 11th and 12th grade where more than half my schedule was actual college classes (not AP or Dual HS/college, I was in class with adults attending only college) and graduated with honors and ~39 college credits. I went to university and graduated with high honors. During this time I met my husband. We got married shortly after graduation, had our our oldest less than a year later, and I never once used my degree in a field that quite honestly made me miserable. \n\nPeople made *a lot* of comments about how I just gave up everything to be a mom, how I was throwing my life away/wasting my life, how I\u2019ll be setting a terrible example for my kids, all kinds of nasty comments.

Part of the current problem with feminism is that it has moved too far away from fighting for women to have *a choice* in how they live, to pushing women to value careers and independence over all else. \n\nAt this point it\u2019s likely that you\u2019ve put your relationship with your sister in a situation where even if she did feel unhappy or threatened by her situation with her husband that she won\u2019t want to open up to you.

My mom still thinks I\u2019m not ready to be a mom because I don\u2019t have a college degree. I\u2019m in my mid 30\u2019s. I\u2019ve had so many jobs, some where it was a point of resentment from my coworkers that we had the same job but I didn\u2019t have a degree in anything (not that theirs were required for what we were doing). The only jobs I\u2019ve ever thrived in were dog grooming and working in a daycare. I always loved baby sitting. I adore children.

Because I wanted children generally have a hard time as adults. \n\nBut raising the next generation of any society is also an extremely important and reasonably hard job to do, as well. That seems to be entirely looked down upon now, and I find it absolutely bizarre", "Conservative =/= anti-feminist.\n\nAlso, believing that the person you marry doesn't deserve equal rights actually does mean it's not a good fit.", "Yes, yes, I'm sure you're absolutely correct about most people on earth.", "Nope.", "Anti-feminist =/= woman hater. \n\nWell, it usually does. But feminism is a movement, and movements are defined by their people. \n\nThere are many folks who are anti-feminist not because they disagree with the notion of equal rights but rather they disagree with the tactics of the movement itself. Such is the downside of an ideological movement. Even those who may agree with 99% feminist ideals may not label themselves a feminist, because they disagree with that 1% and therefore don\u2019t want to be associated with it. Remember that while feminism has the definition of equal rights, that\u2019s just the starting point, because it is a movement. Therefore it is defined based on the collective action of its people. Over time feminism has become more and more associated with radical liberal ideas, and so some people don\u2019t feel comfortable identifying with the label, even if they do advocate for equal rights. Identifying as a feminism implies much more than equal rights in the eyes of many, and when it comes to ideology perception is reality. \n\nConversely, there are feminists who are against women in some ways. Take trans-exclusionary radical feminists, which hold conservative ideals. While they are feminists, they behave and advocate in such a way that they are more radically conservative than some anti-feminists. \n\nIn short, you can be a feminist and woman-hater and you can be an anti-feminist and not be a woman hater. This can also change over time. It\u2019s entirely plausible than in the coming decades feminism will change, as it already has multiple times, in such a way less people will wish to identify with it. Or, it could change in a way where more people identify with it. These things are variable.\n\nThink of it this way: it is entirely possible to be a right-winger and not be homophobic. However, the collective actions of the right do lean towards homophobia. In fact, 80% of house repubs voted against gay marriage protections just this year. Those are the representatives for that group. \n\nSo, when you say you are a right-winger, you will naturally be associated with homophobia. People will see you in that way. And, well, it\u2019s not an unfair assumption given the collective actions of that ideology. And so, many will choose to not stay away from right-wingers, even if they agree on 90% of right wing issues, because they don\u2019t want to be associated with prejudice. \n\nThe same goes for conservatives and the implications of what you\u2019re conserving. Many want to conserve misogynistic and racist ideals of old, so you can see why many would like to not associate with conservatism. \n\nThere\u2019s also, of course, a neutral stance. As in, you can not be a feminist but also not be anti-feminist. But many believe such a stance does not truly exist, and it\u2019s an us versus them situation.
