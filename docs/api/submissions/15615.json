But one of the tactics men like that use to control their victims is to isolate them from the people who love them. Don't make it too easy for him to set it up as \"it's me or them\".", "I told my sister that I disliked her live-in boyfriend that she had a child with.  He isolated her and took a lot of her money as well as strangled her until she fell to the floor holding her infant and eventually broke her arm.  I was the only one of her friends and family still speaking to her after he wouldn\u2019t let her go out and then she couldn\u2019t afford it because he had used all of her money (inheritance).  When he left her, she called me and I was the one there for her.  While she was with him, we made an agreement that we would talk about everything, but him because it would just lead to an argument.  Hope this helps.  I found (although everyone is different) that until she was ready to let him go there was nothing I could do except be there when the chips fell.  I was not ever supportive of their relationship and she knew it, but when it was over I was the one still there.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like he's a total smeghead.", "You\u2019re NTA strictly because you\u2019re coming from a place of concern (that\u2019s what it feels like).\n\nBUT..my advice, stop criticizing and start being there\u2026 if she\u2019s really gotten pregnant that quickly and given up her plans under his \u201cdirective\u201d or his strong desire for that and you\u2019re legitimately worried about her, make sure you\u2019re in a position to be there if things go south.\n\nWorst case he\u2019s controlling her and she\u2019s going to eventually need the support.\n\nBest case they\u2019re just crazy in love and he\u2019s putting her in a spot where she\u2019s free to be her true domestic goddess self.\n\nYou know you\u2019re sister, not a bunch of strangers. But either way, you\u2019re concerned and it\u2019s coming out aggressively..just take a step back, take a breath and make sure you\u2019re always there as a supportive, caring, NOT OVERBEARING sister. Seriously, she\u2019ll need you regardless so make sure she has you.", "INFO\n\nHas your sister expressed any desire to keep working?\n\nDoes she seem otherwise happy?\n\nYou may not like their life choices- but it is their life.", "NTA, but what did you hope to accomplish. Your job is to have her back when she needs you. Confronting her husband just means he\u2019ll try to keep her away from you.", "Light ESH, Mainly NTA\n\ni dont really get the YTAs here, if he really is a misogynist then you should use your words to fight back and put him in his place.\n\nTho here\u2019s the thing, if your sister really does want to be a stay at home mother, and is happy about it, then good for her. Feminism means that these roles in a house/family can be decided by women too, just not forced upon them. Wouldn\u2019t really call it brainwashing.", "NTA. This is a difficult one. From what you\u2019ve said he\u2019s stuck back in history where women had no rights. But at the same time your sister may truly want to be a stay at home mom. I certainly wanted to be. I am only 45. I believe in women\u2019s rights, that women can do anything they want to. But I also always wished to be a SAHM. So your hatred of him sounds deserved but you might want to back off your sister if she truly wants to be SAHM.", "I don\u2019t blame you. He sounds awful. NTA", "Just to be clear, there is nothing wrong with being a SAHM. I could never as I have fears of being financially dependent on someone; however, there is nothing wrong with it as long the sahp feels safe.\n\nAnyhow, you need to be careful with what you say as you don't want your sister to feel like she can't come to you.\n\nNTA but just be careful", "NTA, screw that guy", "Nta but she sounds like she's going to be baby trapped and financially abused. For your sake, and your sake only, you should keep contact but keep distant. You can still support her and be there for her when she will need it, but it going to be draining for you to be there listening to every call or cry she gives you. Hopefully soon, she will come to her senses and you can be there for her to help her get out of this situation, but, until then, it's clear she does not want help, and you can't force help onto people who don't want it. You have to wait until they realize they need to get away from the situation. \n\nMake clear boundaries with her, reiterate that you still love her, but you need space, then wait for the eventual fallout.", "Yta. He may have those views but she may agree with him. She may have always wanted to be a stay at home mom but went to college because she felt pressure from her over powering third wave feminist family. I am so tired of women putting other women down for wanting to be a stay at home mom.", "Um... so I don't think you are necessarily wrong for saying it. Because, frankly, if what you are saying is true and he is all of those things, your sister is about to embark on a horrible journey. Like, this just isn't going to go well at all. Idk what the people in these comments so far are smocking, but if what you are describing is going on, this dude does not have your sister's best interests at heart and she is about to throw her life away and basically tie herself to this man with a child. So somebody had to say something. \n\nLike yeah, sure, her life choices and all and maybe she is happy and what not, but somebody has to adress what this looks like and the very likely mess it will lead to. I mean Freya forbid something goes wrong with her pregnancy and she's got a pro forced birther for a husband.\n\nHowever, not only is your timing off - right after a pregnancy announcement. But your ending statement made the whole thing about YOU. And the fact thar YOU hate him and his views - I don't blame you - but that is not how to approach this. You need to squarely focus on the fact that the life trajectory he is putting her on is making her very vulnerable, very dependant, with no way out, and very little agency. You need to make it about HER and SHE is the one in trouble her and that you are worried about HER. And not about your own hatred for the man and his views.\n\nI know you kind of started there with your questions about what happens in the future, but you really should have made into a long heart to heart where you LET her defend him, and then rebutted her defence with examples and logic. This is a long game type of thing. \n\nYou also have to keep in mind that the person you are insulting - again even if its more of a description that insult - is someone who she loves regardless. And he may actually treat her well on the surface. A lot of these kind of men are romantics up until you actually hit the mysogeny wall. So you have to fight ba k against a completely different perception from what you are seeing and yelling and straight insults won't do that.\n\nSo I am giving you a YTA but not for \"going too far\" as you put it, but more for framing it in a selfish way rather than actually trying to help your sister see what she is getting herself into before she is in the deep end. The discussion needs to be had, but not in that way. As is you probably just gave her husband ammo yo use against you and your family to start isolating her.", "I'm with you! He is exactly what the world needs to be rid of! I hate him too!!", "NTA", "YTA:  Your sister just shared possibly the most exciting news she ever got to tell you.......and you made it into an argument about her husband.  \n\nI have no idea if what you said was true and needed to be said. But if it was, you chose the wrong time.", "YTA - It's fine for you to have your own views, and it's fine for you to not like him because of his views.  Not everyone is going to agree with you.  \n\nYou seem to have a big problem with your sister living her life the way she wants to, not the way you want her to.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong or mysoginostic about being a stay at home mom :/ \nBut I read some of your other comments and yeah that guy sounds like a piece of work.", "YTA. She\u2019s pregnant and crying because you\u2019re attacking the life choices she made. I\u2019m all for standing up to misogyny but you absolutely took it too far.

And please mean it.  She may need help getting away from him one day.

It is her life. She can decide what she wants to do. You don't get to force her to have a job anymore than she can force you to be a SATM.

She may WANT to stay home and be a mother. Women CAN want that.", "YTA, your views are yours, she is happy, you can't seem to accept her happiness because it's not what would make YOU happy. Let her live her life and live yours.", "YTA. This conversation would have been better served before they got married. Choosing to do this at a joyous event like a pregnancy annoucement was really inappropriate. She's married and pregnant...what do you expect her to do? Suddenly jump ship? She doesn't see him the same way you do. I think you're being kind of a drama queen about this. I mean one of your first thoughts about a new baby in your family was feminism \ud83d\ude06 If you keep acting like this, you will ruin your relationship with your sister and all future family gatherings will be awkward and uncomfortable. If this is her decision and she's happy, then be respectful of it and let her be happy.", "So you think that he's  all these horrible things. You think that because your sister doesn't fight back, she's brainwashed instead of agrees with her husband. Other people tell you that you went too far. Yes, YTA", "YTA. Even if you\u2019re right, it was the wrong time and wrong place.", "YTA;\n\nRegardless of if you dislike her husband and how they choose to live their lives, that\u2019s their choice. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t want your sister/her husband to force their views and life choices on you.", "YTA it sounds like your sister chose this man and wasn't forced into this marriage so this is obviously something that she's okay with. You're fine to have your views but you shouldn't force your views on her the same way you don't think he should force his views on her.", "With the limited explanation YTA. First of all I disagree with his viewpoint, but having tantrums because someone disagrees with you doesn\u2019t help anyone grow or change.\nAlso your sister has said she is happy. You are deciding she isn\u2019t. Do you get that you are trying to control her?", "YTA. Bashing your sister for being \u201cbrainwashed\u201d while also trying to overtly control her behavior yourself?

You might hate him because he doesn\u2019t share your views. But he is the father of your niece/nephew. You need to find something about him to like and make it tolerable. He is not going anywhere \n\nWhat was your end game anyways?  You explain to your sister your disapproval and she will divorce him and have an abortion?

Maybe once he has a daughter all his views will change", "YTA... there's nothing wrong with being a housewife and traditional gender roles. If both agreed to have specific roles, him being the provider, and she being the housewife and raising their children, that's non of your business.

Explain to your sister that you were just so frightened for her and concerned about her.", "NTA. But I think you need to approach this differently or he might end up forcing her to cut you off. I don\u2019t think that she will leave him purely because you told her to, especially now that she\u2019s pregnant. Most people in controlling or abusive situations just get angry at the person telling them it\u2019s wrong. So you need to think practically about how to realistically help her. \n\nI think you could try an approach of suggesting that she should have a decent amount of money saved independent of him \u201cincase something happens to him\u201d (aka, incase she ever wants to leave). You could also try to suggest that she does that by considering some kind of part time job or work from home to get that money. She could run a store on etsy, for example. Or even take a course online while at home, which she could do as she will have spare time now. I would try to use the angle that this would help her raise her child, as being more educated can only aid that. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he expects her to homeschool. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are resources that would be more helplful than me, but that\u2019s what came to mind.

It\u2019s a tough line to walk.\n\nI\u2019d say something like, \u201cI really love you and I\u2019m worried for you and the child. Your husband\u2019s views are pretty extreme and most people would be concerned by them. If you want to distance yourself, I get it, but please be wary of isolating yourself from a family support system too much. If you ever need a safe place to run to, I can be that place.

She was fully moved out within 12 hours of break up and calling us, and part of that was because we were sleeping when it went down. \n\nYou absolutely cannot play into those people\u2019s hands when they\u2019re chipping away at your loved one\u2019s self esteem and isolating them from their support system. You have to be willing to play the long game. Especially when there is a kid involved.
