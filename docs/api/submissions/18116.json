About a month ago, my step sister (19f) and I got into a fight about the wedding planning. \n\nWhen we initially went out shopping for my wedding dress, my step sister kept making comments on how she can\u2019t wait for her own wedding. I wasn\u2019t bothered by this, because it was a magical moment we got to spend together. However, she got engaged a little while after this shopping spree and tried making everything about herself. When we had to go look for bridesmaid dresses, she ignored me and my wedding party and talked about what she\u2019s going to do for her own wedding the following year. I tried getting my step sisters attention, because I just wanted to get the shopping over with. I was a little annoyed, but I understood that she\u2019s just excited for her own wedding, and got over it. While we\u2019d go shopping for flowers and other decor for the reception, my step sister would rudely tell me how I had awful taste and that it would ruin my entire wedding. \n\nAs the months went on, my step sister would go out of her way to make more personal jabs about my wedding. She would make the occasional comment of, \u201cWhen I get married, I want my wedding to look better then yours,\u201d and \u201cI want my wedding dress to look better then yours.\u201d \n\nI thought the comments were unnecessary, and didn\u2019t quite understand why she was making it a competition. I tried sitting down with her a couple times to talk about how this wasn\u2019t appropriate behavior, and how the comments really hurt my feelings. She completely ignored me and proceeded to say that if I was pregnant when she gets married, I would be unwelcome to her wedding. This was my final straw, because my step sister knew that I pushed up my wedding so my future husband and I could start a family soon. \n\nI told her that she was being selfish, and had no respect for me and this special day. I ended up telling her that she was kicked out of my wedding, and could only attend as a guest. Later that evening, my step sister told my Dad and Step Mom about the argument, which led to them all disowning me and uninviting themselves from my wedding. \n\nNow my Dad isn\u2019t walking me down the aisle, my Step Mom thinks I\u2019m a jerk, and my Step Sister thinks I got what I deserved.

Disowning you & not walking you down the aisle is ridiculous! \n\nYour step sister was not excited about your wedding, she was condescending & hateful. She is the true A H in this this, followed closely by your father. Can your future FIL walk ya?  Good luck with your wedding, in spite of the family drama. Best wishes for a lifetime filled with love & laughter with your soon to be husband.", "NTA. The step sister is being very inappropriate, and if I were you, I would go to the courthouse, get married with just you two, and spend the wedding money on your honeymoon. Cancel the whole thing. It sounds like your SO is the only one that supports you.", "NTA.\n\nCould you clarify exactly how they phrased it when your parents disowned you and decided not to be a part of your wedding? This seems so wild. Do your parents have a pattern of siding with your step sister?\n\nEverything about the actions of your parents and step sister suggest this isn't an isolated incident.", "NTA I know this hurts now hun but your better off without them cause your dad is a major asshole for taking your stepsisters side and not his own daughter you did nothing wrong.", "You\u2019re NTA. But your Dad & steps sure are!", "NTA but I guess we can see where step-sis got her entitled behavior from. \n\nIf you previously had a good relationship with your dad, try talking to him and lay out in detail what occurred. It's possible he might surprise you and attend your wedding after all.", "Wow your step sister is an AH but your father is way above that.\n\nThey have shown their true colours and this way you can be sure you will only be surrounded by people who trully love and care about you.\n\nNTA and all the best!", "Do you have a stepdad or uncle that can walk you down the aisle?

From this and your other comments on this thread, it sounds like you'll be better off without the golden child and her enabling parents.", "NTA, I'm so sorry you are being treated so badly by your family. Your stepsister is turning everything into an uncomfortable situation that's very unnecessary.", "NTA... go enjoy your wedding less people u have to deal with and when you have kids they will miss out... go enjoy your day and planning u have people there that wants to be there and are truly by your side...\nStepsister  stepmom and dad are all major AH\n..", "NTA. But what's the bet that step sis didn't tell them the full story...", "NTA- I'm sorry that was their reaction from hearing one side of the story. But something's can be a blessing in disguise.", "NTA, but why was everyone involved in everything? Your dress and bridesmaid dresses, yes they should be there. The rest of it is your responsibility and it's just asking for drama to invite the entire wedding party to do it all together!", "NTA, ban the stepsister from the wedding as well.  She will make it all about her and go out of her way to bring you down.  If the programs have not been printed remove his name. Have a few friends to work as security as your dad may show up and make a toast to your stepsister's upcoming wedding.", "Is she the biological daughter of your dad and stepmom?  If so, she is your half sister, not your step sister.  ESH.  Your half sister is obviously competitive and jealous of you.  You sound jealous of her.  You both are in the wrong.  Your Dad sucks for backing out and taking sides between his children.", "My step sister was my Dad and Step Mom\u2019s first kid together, so she was always seen as the golden child. She got whatever she wanted growing up, and never seemed to get into trouble even if she started it. My parents favor her immensely! \n\nWhen my Dad found out about the argument, he called me saying that he wasn\u2019t interested in walking a daughter down the aisle who wasn\u2019t going to respect her sister. I explained that my feelings were really hurt, and he said that I sounded like my mother. He told me he didn\u2019t want anything to do with me anymore because I was selfish, which led me to argue with him about the years of disrespect I faced from him. The whole thing felt like the cherry on top of a lot of problems we had for awhile now.", "Just FYI, the stepsister is also the dad's biological daughter (with the stepmother).", "If you have had years of disrespect from your father consider this a wedding gift to you. You no longer need to concern yourself with his thoughts and opinions", "It is obviously sad when a family has this kind of thing going on, but you honestly did the right thing and being separated from your dad might ultimately be the best thing for you if he has a habit of using that \"You sound just like your mom\" line.", "They're fully expecting you to beg for their forgiveness, so don't give them the satisfaction. Cut them off, go NC. Have your mom or someone significant walk you down the aisle. Or walk with your fiance. NTA", "Hi OP, I am so sorry what you dealt with so NTA. You did nothing wrong here. You kicked her out because her behaviour was becoming intolerable which you do not need more toxicity ruining the good mood", "Better off without him.  He will make it all about her and not you.  I can envision the Father Daughter dance being you sister and dad, not you.  I can envision his toast turning your reception into an engagement party for her.", "It sounds like your dad resents you based on superficial similarities between you and your mother, and won't be interested in you until you turn into someone you're not. I don't recommend doing this, because you seem like a kind and level-headed person now, and the sister he wants you to emulate, not so much.\n\n\"Thanks Dad! Knowing that your reasons for hating me are A) the fact that I'm like my mother in some way and B) am willing to express my feelings like an adult, I can move on with my life knowing nothing I could ever say could get you to see me in a good light. Enjoy your daughter's wedding, and I'll enjoy mine!\"\n\nI know it hurts, but his hangups really have nothing to do with you. I hope you have other family members, like your future spouse, who love and support you for who you are.", "So she's a half-sister?", "Nta.  Is your soon to be FIL available?  What about step dad? Uncle, grandparent? Mom?  I would find someone else to step in.  Mom or FIL if possible. When dad gets upset, and he will get butthurt, just reply with \u201c Well I asked you, but you decided you didn\u2019t love me enough to walk me down the aisle. Don\u2019t worry I found someone who does love me enough.  You won\u2019t be needed at my wedding.  By the way, the seats set aside for y\u2019all  have already been filled, there is only 1 available, step mom and your precious little monster are not longer able to come.  If he and your mom don\u2019t get along, HAVE HER WALK you. Don\u2019t give them the please of hurting you or making you mad. Get petty", "NTA\n\nShe said you couldn't come to her wedding if you are pregnant, which you hopefully will be. She's the one who potentially uninvited YOU!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd disowning? What an over reaction", "NTA but your dad is a spineless coward.", "I'm struggling to understand what the issue here might be. The trash already took itself out. So, how would that make you an asshole? Perhaps you should take a step back and breathe. There appears to be less bullshit surrounding your bliss.\n\n\nHave a pleasant wedding with the people that matter and care about you, Op. Congrats.", "This is the only way op.. They don't love you.. Don't waste time with them. NTA."]}
