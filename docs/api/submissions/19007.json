Why does it need to stay at your mother's place?", "NTA\n\nI would go a step further and say that you should not leave the cradle at your parents' house at all. Take it now before it gets to be too late.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had a sit-and-spin that my grandmother asked to borrow. It was one of my favorite toys, but I didn't mind it being there since I went there frequently. When my parents got a divorce, I did not see my grandmother from the time I was around 8 until I was in my 20s. The sit-and-spin now belongs to one of my cousins who I had not seen since she was two years old (both mid-30s now).\n\nSame situation with the rocking chair my mother used on me, although she did manage to get that one back when I was in my late 20s, and I still have it.\n\nI can't reiterate enough. Take the cradle now.", "ESH. I think what\u2019s making this situation weird is that you want to claim the cradle as yours but it is at your parents house. You\u2019re an adult, so if it is truly yours, just move it to your own place so that your parents aren\u2019t stuck in the middle between your sister and you. It is a weird dynamic when adult children want to use their parents houses for storage yet the parents are the ones dealing with the other people\u2019s usage or interest in it. But do confirm that it was actually given to you and not your parents. Most of my baby stuff was actually given to my parents at a baby shower for instance. Parents get given a lot with their first kids but the assumption is they will likely use it for whatever kids they have. If the neighbor gave it to your mother to use for you and subsequent babies, then she may still consider it hers until if and when she gives it to you. I guess I\u2019m not quite sure why you have more claim than the other babies who slept in it, unless this is weird like the British throne legally going to the kid who happens to be born first or something.", "Wait, so it was used by you and all of your siblings yet you're the only one that can own it? YTA", "YWBTA. Your sister needs the cradle now, you just hypothetically want the option to use the cradle some day. You are acting like a child.", "ESH. You have every right to feel sentimental about this family heirloom but do you have immediate plans to use the cradle within the next couple years? If you are holding off on kids for the foreseeable future it is just sitting in storage gathering dust when another member of your immediate family can use it pretty much immediately. Also, this may feel like your cradle but your parents own it. While they should take your feelings into consideration they are well within their rights as the owner of the cradle to let her use it and it isn't great that you are trying to overrule them on what they do with their property.\n\nAt the same time, swiping the furniture from your aunt out from under you was definitely a crappy thing to do and I would be wary of your sister as well if that had happened to me. \n\nIf I were you I would sit my family down and calmly explain your reasoning for being hesitant to let your sister take it. Your reason is valid for sure and should be addressed before she takes the cradle. There also should be an expectation set that as soon as the baby is too big for the cradle that it goes back to your parents for the next member of the family that will need it. If you can lay out an agreement up front that everyone agrees to and your sister falls through on it later, at that point I would start being more hesitant to let her use family items going forward if you are the deciding party for the particular item in question.", "YTA\n\nYour sister needs a cradle and does not have a job. it's obviously not yours outright since your mom still has possession of it... she can decide to change her mind on who gets to use it or not. The same thing goes for her will/estate and anything else \"promised to you\"\n\nIf it means that much to you, have a conversation about, maybe offer to buy her a crib , or express how you really want to use it when it's your turn and force your sister to decide if she will be a future asshole or not.\n\nBut yeah, you seem super entitled to the crib despite not even having a kid yet.", "WIBTA\n\nit's obviously your parents' cradle and not yours, you did not acquire ownership of it as an infant\n\nit was used for all the children in the family and your sister is the one having a baby now\n\nworrying that you won't get it back in some abstract future when you might need it, is not a good enough reason to gatekeep a family heirloom", "You're not planning to have kids right now. The cradle is not yours as such? Why can't you share? It's in storage, not on display like a prized possession.\n\nYou honestly sound a bit much. \n\nYTA. Be nice, let your sister use it.", "NTA. If you can, buy her her own cradle as they are on limited means.", "NTA. You have an emotional attachment to something from your childhood and you don\u2019t want it damaged or lost or whatever,  for when you use it. But technically, it was a crib gifted to your mom for when she had you and used it for all your siblings? Im not certain it really belongs to just you. you just were the first one to sleep in it.", "YTA. It\u2019s just a thing that you\u2019re attaching a lot of materialistic value to. It doesn\u2019t matter. You could be the bigger person instead of being selfish and petty.", "NTA.\n\nI can totally see where you're coming from, including your mom and sister because they may think its just the family's furniture to give and take as long as your mom who owns it say its okay. This all seems like you guys have a different idea on what to do with it and the actual importance of the cradle itself, and if it could be shared around.\n\nI believe that you have a right to be attached to the cradle if it is dearly special for you and have a  need to keep it safe and in good enough condition for future use. Whereas for your sister and mom, in order to get your point across and keeping your cradle, you need to clearly communicate with them on why its so special to you and why you want it kept at the house, I can understand their frustration as they may think your simply hogging it / your reasons are not good enough, I think they just need more insight on why you feel this way and your worries.\n\nIf this does all get resolved and you do get to keep it, I suggest that you take the cradle with you to wherever you live so that you don't have to possibly go thru this situation again and officially claim the piece of furniture you value.", ">I\u2019m not planning to have kids right now, but when I do I want to make sure I get to use the cradle.\n\nSo you want the cradle for the kids that don't exist yet?\n\nHow does that make sense?\n\nYour sister is moving and having a baby that is expensive.\n\nAnd i don't see how you are entitled to it at this moment", "YWNBTA but I'd recommend moving it to storage somewhere else if possible, your parents may try to claim the decision-making power since it's kept at their house.", "YWNBTA as your mother has shown your her true colors.\n\nPlease understand I used a handmade wooden cradle with each of my children. Then allowed my sisters to use it for their children. Then another family member gave it to a cousin. That cousin gave it away.", "Honestly, I know this kind of relationship with siblings. NTA, don't let her walk all over you if that has happened in the past.", "NTA \nIf you have already moved out I would not trust your mother with the cradle. She will 100% let your sister \u201cborrow\u201d it and your sister will never return it claiming it\u2019s if sentimental value to her since her kid used it.

Now!", "Did you read the entire thread about the mother already lying to her in the past?", "She\u2019s not attaching materialistic value to it, it\u2019s sentimental value. She used it, their neighbor hand made it for her, she wants to use it for her kids. \n\nYou are not obligated to let someone use something just because they are related to you. Especially not when they have a habit of not returning things and would likely throw a fit if you asked for it back. \n\nIt\u2019s also absurd to ask someone to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d when they are in the right. They are both grown adults. It would be just as easy for her sister to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d and buy her own", "She's entitled to it because it is hers, whether she is using it right now or not. With that same logic, maybe you should give your entire paycheck to the next panhandler you see on the side of the road. After all, you're wanting to keep that money to pay bills that are not due yet.", "They would claim the decision making power because it\u2019s theirs. Just because OP thinks she\u2019s entitled to it doesn\u2019t mean it belongs to her.", "Let's be real, the nieghbor made the crib for the mom and parents, he/she didn't look at the newborn and think.... you are special.. to you I give you a a valuable piece of furniture  with the expectation that you will cherish it forever.", "The neighbor likely made it for the parents. Yes it was \"for her\" because she was the first child but the neighbor would have expected it to be used for all children the parents had not just the first. That makes it a gift to the parents.", "but the question still remains... is it actually hers, or is she just feeling entitled to it because it was \"promised\". Parents always make promises that don't pan out for some reason or another. My guess is mom thought the eldest would be the first to squirt out a baby, and mom saying \"this crib is yours\" was just code for :\"GIMMIE GRANDBABIES!!!\"", "Technically it's her parents.\n\nIt was made for her but gifted to her parents, so wouldn't the parents be the one to decide it?", "Let\u2019s be real, the mother already lied to her child once regarding furniture.", "The neighbor made it because the mother was pregnant. It was for the baby to use. They had no idea if they would go on to have more kids. Just how at a baby shower gifts are given. Toys, clothes, bottles, and things for the nursery are given to the baby. Cream, nursing pads, post deliver care products, etc. are given to the mom. If a baby toy is given at a baby shower (even a hand crafted wooden toy one) it isn\u2019t being given to the parents, it\u2019s given to the baby. Also, since that\u2019s the current baby about to be born, it\u2019s not given with the expectation it will be used for more than one baby."]}
