Take it now before it gets to be too late.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had a sit-and-spin that my grandmother asked to borrow. It was one of my favorite toys, but I didn't mind it being there since I went there frequently. When my parents got a divorce, I did not see my grandmother from the time I was around 8 until I was in my 20s. The sit-and-spin now belongs to one of my cousins who I had not seen since she was two years old (both mid-30s now).\n\nSame situation with the rocking chair my mother used on me, although she did manage to get that one back when I was in my late 20s, and I still have it.\n\nI can't reiterate enough. Take the cradle now.", "ESH. I think what\u2019s making this situation weird is that you want to claim the cradle as yours but it is at your parents house. You\u2019re an adult, so if it is truly yours, just move it to your own place so that your parents aren\u2019t stuck in the middle between your sister and you. It is a weird dynamic when adult children want to use their parents houses for storage yet the parents are the ones dealing with the other people\u2019s usage or interest in it. But do confirm that it was actually given to you and not your parents. Most of my baby stuff was actually given to my parents at a baby shower for instance. Parents get given a lot with their first kids but the assumption is they will likely use it for whatever kids they have. If the neighbor gave it to your mother to use for you and subsequent babies, then she may still consider it hers until if and when she gives it to you. I guess I\u2019m not quite sure why you have more claim than the other babies who slept in it, unless this is weird like the British throne legally going to the kid who happens to be born first or something.", "Wait, so it was used by you and all of your siblings yet you're the only one that can own it?

You have every right to feel sentimental about this family heirloom but do you have immediate plans to use the cradle within the next couple years? If you are holding off on kids for the foreseeable future it is just sitting in storage gathering dust when another member of your immediate family can use it pretty much immediately. Also, this may feel like your cradle but your parents own it. While they should take your feelings into consideration they are well within their rights as the owner of the cradle to let her use it and it isn't great that you are trying to overrule them on what they do with their property.\n\nAt the same time, swiping the furniture from your aunt out from under you was definitely a crappy thing to do and I would be wary of your sister as well if that had happened to me. \n\nIf I were you I would sit my family down and calmly explain your reasoning for being hesitant to let your sister take it. Your reason is valid for sure and should be addressed before she takes the cradle. There also should be an expectation set that as soon as the baby is too big for the cradle that it goes back to your parents for the next member of the family that will need it. If you can lay out an agreement up front that everyone agrees to and your sister falls through on it later, at that point I would start being more hesitant to let her use family items going forward if you are the deciding party for the particular item in question.", "YTA\n\nYour sister needs a cradle and does not have a job. it's obviously not yours outright since your mom still has possession of it... she can decide to change her mind on who gets to use it or not.

Whereas for your sister and mom, in order to get your point across and keeping your cradle, you need to clearly communicate with them on why its so special to you and why you want it kept at the house, I can understand their frustration as they may think your simply hogging it / your reasons are not good enough, I think they just need more insight on why you feel this way and your worries.\n\nIf this does all get resolved and you do get to keep it, I suggest that you take the cradle with you to wherever you live so that you don't have to possibly go thru this situation again and officially claim the piece of furniture you value.", ">I\u2019m not planning to have kids right now, but when I do I want to make sure I get to use the cradle.\n\nSo you want the cradle for the kids that don't exist yet?\n\nHow does that make sense?\n\nYour sister is moving and having a baby that is expensive.\n\nAnd i don't see how you are entitled to it at this moment", "YWNBTA but I'd recommend moving it to storage somewhere else if possible, your parents may try to claim the decision-making power since it's kept at their house.", "YWNBTA as your mother has shown your her true colors.\n\nPlease understand I used a handmade wooden cradle with each of my children.

OP was raised to think that the cradle would be hers. She particularly says she was always told that she would use it for her kids. \n\nTo me, that sounds like her parents gave her ownership of it. Did her parents say that to any of her other siblings? Idk but it doesn\u2019t sound (from OP\u2019s perspective) like they said that to the other children.. which, again, I can understand why OP sees it as hers. \n\nMaybe the sister didn\u2019t know, or maybe she did? We don\u2019t know. But it is on OP\u2019s parents to make such things clear to everyone.
