Take it now before it gets to be too late.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I had a sit-and-spin that my grandmother asked to borrow. It was one of my favorite toys, but I didn't mind it being there since I went there frequently. When my parents got a divorce, I did not see my grandmother from the time I was around 8 until I was in my 20s. The sit-and-spin now belongs to one of my cousins who I had not seen since she was two years old (both mid-30s now).\n\nSame situation with the rocking chair my mother used on me, although she did manage to get that one back when I was in my late 20s, and I still have it.\n\nI can't reiterate enough. Take the cradle now.", "ESH. I think what\u2019s making this situation weird is that you want to claim the cradle as yours but it is at your parents house. You\u2019re an adult, so if it is truly yours, just move it to your own place so that your parents aren\u2019t stuck in the middle between your sister and you. It is a weird dynamic when adult children want to use their parents houses for storage yet the parents are the ones dealing with the other people\u2019s usage or interest in it. But do confirm that it was actually given to you and not your parents. Most of my baby stuff was actually given to my parents at a baby shower for instance. Parents get given a lot with their first kids but the assumption is they will likely use it for whatever kids they have. If the neighbor gave it to your mother to use for you and subsequent babies, then she may still consider it hers until if and when she gives it to you. I guess I\u2019m not quite sure why you have more claim than the other babies who slept in it, unless this is weird like the British throne legally going to the kid who happens to be born first or something.", "Wait, so it was used by you and all of your siblings yet you're the only one that can own it?

You have every right to feel sentimental about this family heirloom but do you have immediate plans to use the cradle within the next couple years? If you are holding off on kids for the foreseeable future it is just sitting in storage gathering dust when another member of your immediate family can use it pretty much immediately. Also, this may feel like your cradle but your parents own it. While they should take your feelings into consideration they are well within their rights as the owner of the cradle to let her use it and it isn't great that you are trying to overrule them on what they do with their property.\n\nAt the same time, swiping the furniture from your aunt out from under you was definitely a crappy thing to do and I would be wary of your sister as well if that had happened to me. \n\nIf I were you I would sit my family down and calmly explain your reasoning for being hesitant to let your sister take it. Your reason is valid for sure and should be addressed before she takes the cradle. There also should be an expectation set that as soon as the baby is too big for the cradle that it goes back to your parents for the next member of the family that will need it. If you can lay out an agreement up front that everyone agrees to and your sister falls through on it later, at that point I would start being more hesitant to let her use family items going forward if you are the deciding party for the particular item in question.", "YTA\n\nYour sister needs a cradle and does not have a job. it's obviously not yours outright since your mom still has possession of it... she can decide to change her mind on who gets to use it or not.

Whereas for your sister and mom, in order to get your point across and keeping your cradle, you need to clearly communicate with them on why its so special to you and why you want it kept at the house, I can understand their frustration as they may think your simply hogging it / your reasons are not good enough, I think they just need more insight on why you feel this way and your worries.\n\nIf this does all get resolved and you do get to keep it, I suggest that you take the cradle with you to wherever you live so that you don't have to possibly go thru this situation again and officially claim the piece of furniture you value.", ">I\u2019m not planning to have kids right now, but when I do I want to make sure I get to use the cradle.\n\nSo you want the cradle for the kids that don't exist yet?\n\nHow does that make sense?\n\nYour sister is moving and having a baby that is expensive.\n\nAnd i don't see how you are entitled to it at this moment", "YWNBTA but I'd recommend moving it to storage somewhere else if possible, your parents may try to claim the decision-making power since it's kept at their house.", "YWNBTA as your mother has shown your her true colors.\n\nPlease understand I used a handmade wooden cradle with each of my children.

The parents shouldn't have referred to it as OP's cradle for years only to give it to someone else. And OP probably should have taken it when they moved out.", "Is she about ro have another baby? Then no need to pass it in between", "The cradle that the previous commenter said she should be willing to share.", "That\u2019s true for the furniture set but I feel like since op doesn\u2019t need the cradle then why not let sister have it? It\u2019s not hers technically and legally speaking. Also we don\u2019t even know if the cradle is safe.", "Little boy blue and the man on the moon.", "That\u2019s not always accurate. I was handmade a cradle by my uncle when I was a baby and it was for me. Into the bottom he burned \u201cto:me love:uncle him\u201d \n\nSo there\u2019s a possibility it was to then specifically. I\u2019m not sure why people speak so factually when you have no evidence of it. Sure, what you said is more likely, but that doesn\u2019t make you right and it\u2019s only doing you a desservice to speak as if you\u2019re correct when we both know there no way you could know if you are. You\u2019re just stating an opinion and saying it as if it\u2019s fact.", "Wondering if they were calling it OP's bed talking to OP or everyone. It was shared bed so they can easily refer to it as \"your bed\" talking to every sibling, because it was in fact their bed as well.", "They called it like that, again, because she was the first to use it. When the second baby came, she was using the cradle after the X, hance the name, and it sticked.\n\nNo one was thinking \"let's better not use the name, becuase later X will call dibs.\"\n\nSomething like that is a family thing, after all, OPs brothers and sister used the cradle as well, it was also \"their cradle\" on some point, and the name doesn't matter here. It's actually the other way around IMO, and the most recent \"dibs\" trumps the older \"dibs\". it could be argued that it's Y's cradle, cause she used it last.\n\nBut reality is - it's a family cradle, anyone can use it when they have a kid, and trying to take it for themselves is selfish.", "Now.i got that earworm thanks y'all", "Man __in__ the moon. \n\nListen to the song again.", "Oh wow, you were there?\n\nBecause I'm going from information given in this post and from that it is clear that OP the baby was given this crib even through everyone used it. Heirlooms belong to someone, often it is the first person to use it, often it is not. In this case it is OP who was given the crib with the later siblings using it. OP is not blocking anyone from using it, OP is literally making sure other siblings can use it but that it remains with OP as their property.\n\nIt is the little sister that is trying to steal the crib for herself from the other siblings to use and in OP case to own.", "Lol, you don't have to be there to understand the situation. The gifts that are being used by a newborn are being gifted to parents. It's up to them how they use it, and what they do with them. They could have thrown away the cradle after OP have grown out of it and OP would never know anything about it and wouldn't care for it for one second.\n\nAs for not blocking - what are you on about? OP is actively trying to block her sister from using it? How is the sister trying to steal it? She is taking out a family cradle from storage - to use it as it's supposed to be used. And OP is saying no on some faint possibility of her some day, maybe having children.", "If the rocking chair is for him you should get his future siblings a rocking chair as well, should there happen to be any."]}
