Her and her husband are thrilled because they apparently wanted a girl. She said right then that the baby would be named Mary.\n\nFor reference Bea is a \"born again\" christian. She found Jesus during her third time in rehab. She'll go on and on to anyone who'll listen about how she had \"visions\" of the Virgin Mary by her bedside telling her she would get better, that the pain was temporary and how she would do great things after recovering. That was eight years ago, she met her husband not long after that, in church, of course and fell head over heels in love saying that God made them for each other.\n\nI kind of rolled my eyes at the declaration, Mary is just so old, and boring. Bea asked me what was wrong, I was honest and told her I thought the name was a little boring, at the least she could do something like Miriam and make Mary a nickname. It's 2023, kids will make fun of her for having an old lady name once she's older.\n\nI myself have an old lady name, think Edith or something and it's a PAIN, kids in grade school constantly called me grandma Edith and the sort, saying I was destined to be an old hag who would live in the woods and have a crooked nose.\n\nI'm also worried for the baby, Bea isn't a reliable person, she's been sober for years and everyone still walks on eggshells around her, she used to run off to go on drug binges all the time, a few times leaving me home alone as a kid so she could meet one of her dealers while our parents where out. \n\nShe brought it up a few days ago, mentioning how she was hurt I didn't like the name and asked if I was being honest in my feelings. I told her I was, Mary is a fucking stupid name, she'll get bullied in school for it or at the very least if she goes to some kind of christian school it'll confused the hell out of her because every other girl will be called Mary.\n\nShe called me cruel and an asshole and accused me of hating her and not caring that she was finally in a good place in life. As if she hasn't been \"in a good place in life\" before and relapsed, leaving our parents in debt paying for therapy and rehab that don't work and letting us clean up all her messes over and over again.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674277224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hj66v/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_babys_name_is/", "score": 130, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her and her husband are thrilled because they apparently wanted a girl. She said right then that the baby would be named Mary.\n\nFor reference Bea is a \"born again\" christian. She found Jesus during her third time in rehab. She'll go on and on to anyone who'll listen about how she had \"visions\" of the Virgin Mary by her bedside telling her she would get better, that the pain was temporary and how she would do great things after recovering. That was eight years ago, she met her husband not long after that, in church, of course and fell head over heels in love saying that God made them for each other.\n\nI kind of rolled my eyes at the declaration, Mary is just so old, and boring. Bea asked me what was wrong, I was honest and told her I thought the name was a little boring, at the least she could do something like Miriam and make Mary a nickname. It's 2023, kids will make fun of her for having an old lady name once she's older.\n\nI myself have an old lady name, think Edith or something and it's a PAIN, kids in grade school constantly called me grandma Edith and the sort, saying I was destined to be an old hag who would live in the woods and have a crooked nose.\n\nI'm also worried for the baby, Bea isn't a reliable person, she's been sober for years and everyone still walks on eggshells around her, she used to run off to go on drug binges all the time, a few times leaving me home alone as a kid so she could meet one of her dealers while our parents where out. \n\nShe brought it up a few days ago, mentioning how she was hurt I didn't like the name and asked if I was being honest in my feelings. I told her I was, Mary is a fucking stupid name, she'll get bullied in school for it or at the very least if she goes to some kind of christian school it'll confused the hell out of her because every other girl will be called Mary.\n\nShe called me cruel and an asshole and accused me of hating her and not caring that she was finally in a good place in life. As if she hasn't been \"in a good place in life\" before and relapsed, leaving our parents in debt paying for therapy and rehab that don't work and letting us clean up all her messes over and over again.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'd go by B.B at that point!", "Loled at banana bucky", "LMAO, Imma name my first born Banana Bucky.", "I like both names, but \u201cMiriam\u201d sounds way more old-fashioned than \u201dMary\u201d to me. OP\u2019s excuse for her assholery doesn\u2019t even make sense.", "Not in Kiryas Joel.", "Why would Miriam get her harassed?", "Come the yuletide season she can be Mary Christmas.", "And a lot of projection. Stuff like that I bet is what OP's wanted to say to their parents.", "I\u2019d rather name my kid Optimus Prime than name her after OP at this point. At least Optimus Prime is someone to look up to. OP sounds like they just don\u2019t like the name bc it has to do with Christianity, and OP hates it. They made fun of and borderline ridiculed Christianity the entire time and put their sister down too. \n\n\u201cI kind of rolled my eyes at the declaration\u201d \n\nYou sounds liked your making fun of their struggle with their addiction. You should be proud she actually managed to work through it, probably without any help from you. \n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t a reliable person\u201d but she has been clean eight years according to you. She\u2019s clearly put time and effort into staying clean and has a good support system in her man, and not in you. I\u2019d recommend she cuts you out of her life completely. YTA\n\nAnd the whole \u201cits 2023\u201d thing always gets on my nerves. Why should people conform to what the masses want just bc others say they shouldn\u2019t stick out? Why are we bullying people who don\u2019t want to keep up with the jones? Why can\u2019t people actually think for themselves instead of just following all the time? When did it become so normalized to just do what everyone else does just because something might happen? There\u2019s so much in our world that\u2019s messed up and wrong, and just going along with it will never change anything. Giving baby a name that people won\u2019t make fun of won\u2019t teach other kids to stop bullying.", "Thinking of you, too. I hope you\u2019re able to find peace in your moms addiction \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "I'm not disagreeing on the YTA.  But as a kid named a popular name, it kinda sucks when you get to school and there are 5 'Mary's in your class. But I'd have phrased that thought *way* more diplomatically and not with an eyeroll at the gender reveal. OP just sounds contemptuous about her sister.\n\nETA: it really sucks when you draw the short straw in school, your teacher wants everyone to have different names, not just adding initials, there's already a kid named your last name, the usual nicknames of your name have already been claimed, and your middle name is something like 'Sunshine' or 'Happiness'. Shut up. It's a family name. I spent a year going by a combination of my initials. No one other than my parents used my real name.", "Or as I keep [jokingly I promise] suggesting to my pregnant sister, Toblerone", "I suggest you read it. She\u2019s an even bigger ah than you think.", "\u201cMayoree.\u201d And agreed, YTA.", "My former brother-in-law wanted to name my niece Abcde. And before I knew the spelling, I thought it was kind of a pretty name. It is unusual, but I would like Absidy as a name. But I also understand the people who wouldn\u2019t like it. I also didn\u2019t mind Nevaeh as a name, I just didn\u2019t know where it came from. A friend pointed out that it is heaven spelled backwards.", "Same.", "How is her sister pushing her religion on anyone?", "Sarah, Martha, Susanna, Miriam (lol. She didn't like that the name was an old biblical name with... an old biblical name), Ruth, Anna, Chloe, Abigail, Lydia, Leah, Joanna... just to add a few more.", "Literally nothing wrong with the name Mary \ud83d\ude44", "So, would you say that Mary was quite contrary?", "Old lady names for babies are a massive trend among Millenials, so she probably wouldn't even be the only Gertrude or Phyllis in her class. Violet, Hazel, Edith, Gladys- theyre all having a resurgence.", "This is like my SILs mother who heard my nephews name and told my brother and SIL that he\u2019d get called Jew boy and then turned around and immediately suggested Jonah as a name for him. She still doesn\u2019t call him by his name which annoys my SIL and they are very low contact with her fam", "Old fashioned names are still good. I know someone with a daughter called Mabel.", "Right, but I didn\u2019t want to mention that since OP was disparaging her sister\u2019s religious beliefs.", "Seriously? That makes no sense. The baby will need a name in the meantime.", "I know someone who did name their kid khaleesi\u2026. Everyone was silent when they announced it. The name hasn\u2019t aged well lol", "I\u2019m not sure it was the _sister_ who was neglectful. If she was having these problems and was unreliable at that age, she never should have been made responsible for OP *while the parents went out*\nThe PARENTS shouldn\u2019t have left her. Being angry with the sister here is misplaced.", "Eh, I think it was the parents who were neglectful if they were leaving her with a drug-addicted teenage sibling as a babysitter. OPs anger seems misdirected.", "Where was the sister abusive?\n\nI only saw that sister left OP at home. That's not abuse or neglect unless the sister was OP's parent.", "My friend and I used to have a running joke that chlamydia is not a kind of flower. Your comment now has me worried that there is someone out there who is considering naming their child Chlamydia.", "Miriam also has biblical connections so I\u2019m really not seeing a whole lot of difference, tbh.", "Miriam makes me think of Professor Sprout.", "Hello from Monroe! \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "It\u2019s an even older sounding name, I guess", "That's what my name was going to be.  Miriam Rebekah or Rebekah Miriam.  My parents couldn't agree on the order so they went with Katherine Olivia instead lol.  I actually really like the name Miriam \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  o also like Mary too though, it's my mom's middle name.  OP is off base, Mary is a common name and there is nothing wrong with it.  That would be like saying the names Mark or Mike are stupid.", "Thank you, I genuinely appreciate that. I'm in a pretty good place in my life now, so truly, I worry more for my mother and her opinion of herself. I hope that she's able to find peace, even if I can't be there to help her do it.\n\nSending good vibes from Kentucky!", "I don\u2019t know if I need that level of toxic in my life\u2026", "And has a garden with silver bells and cockle shell all laid out in a row?", "There's a Guinevere, a Ceridwen, and a Juliet at my daughter's school. She's asked her dad a couple of times why she has a boring name like Shannon. Lol", "Maybe it\u2019s my love for Downton Abbey, but Violet is awesome. Mary and Edith are top notch.  Not a big fan of Marigold.", "Hazel is on the list for the baby I am currently cooking.    It\u2019s in the top 200 names of last year.", "That\u2019s fair. I just think it makes her argument more ridiculous. \u2018Don\u2019t call her Mary because of religion. Call her Miriam, which is the same person from the same story, from an older religion\u2019", "Or the parents simply didn\u2019t know.", "Unless they didn\u2019t know. Did OP\u2019s sister tell them she was on drugs? Or did she keep that to herself?", "She left her at home alone as a child to run off with drug dealers. Meaning OP was in her care at the time. And presumably returned high, meaning she was incapacitated as a caregiver to OP.", "Have you ever seen the movie Waiting?", "Neither will, OP is making stuff up.", ">Meaning OP was in her care at the time.\n\nI suppose we don't know that.\n\nHowever, the parents knew that the sister had this problem and opted to leave a young child alone with a drug addict. That's not responsible parenting.\n\nEither way though, Mary is a perfectly normal name and OP should probably seek some therapy over why she's so angry.\n\nThe sister got help and got clean. OP can get help too."]}
