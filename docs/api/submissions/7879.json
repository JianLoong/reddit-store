Her and her husband are thrilled because they apparently wanted a girl. She said right then that the baby would be named Mary.\n\nFor reference Bea is a \"born again\" christian. She found Jesus during her third time in rehab. She'll go on and on to anyone who'll listen about how she had \"visions\" of the Virgin Mary by her bedside telling her she would get better, that the pain was temporary and how she would do great things after recovering. That was eight years ago, she met her husband not long after that, in church, of course and fell head over heels in love saying that God made them for each other.\n\nI kind of rolled my eyes at the declaration, Mary is just so old, and boring. Bea asked me what was wrong, I was honest and told her I thought the name was a little boring, at the least she could do something like Miriam and make Mary a nickname. It's 2023, kids will make fun of her for having an old lady name once she's older.\n\nI myself have an old lady name, think Edith or something and it's a PAIN, kids in grade school constantly called me grandma Edith and the sort, saying I was destined to be an old hag who would live in the woods and have a crooked nose.\n\nI'm also worried for the baby, Bea isn't a reliable person, she's been sober for years and everyone still walks on eggshells around her, she used to run off to go on drug binges all the time, a few times leaving me home alone as a kid so she could meet one of her dealers while our parents where out. \n\nShe brought it up a few days ago, mentioning how she was hurt I didn't like the name and asked if I was being honest in my feelings. I told her I was, Mary is a fucking stupid name, she'll get bullied in school for it or at the very least if she goes to some kind of christian school it'll confused the hell out of her because every other girl will be called Mary.\n\nShe called me cruel and an asshole and accused me of hating her and not caring that she was finally in a good place in life. As if she hasn't been \"in a good place in life\" before and relapsed, leaving our parents in debt paying for therapy and rehab that don't work and letting us clean up all her messes over and over again.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674277224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10hj66v/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_babys_name_is/", "score": 1471, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her and her husband are thrilled because they apparently wanted a girl. She said right then that the baby would be named Mary.\n\nFor reference Bea is a \"born again\" christian. She found Jesus during her third time in rehab. She'll go on and on to anyone who'll listen about how she had \"visions\" of the Virgin Mary by her bedside telling her she would get better, that the pain was temporary and how she would do great things after recovering. That was eight years ago, she met her husband not long after that, in church, of course and fell head over heels in love saying that God made them for each other.\n\nI kind of rolled my eyes at the declaration, Mary is just so old, and boring. Bea asked me what was wrong, I was honest and told her I thought the name was a little boring, at the least she could do something like Miriam and make Mary a nickname. It's 2023, kids will make fun of her for having an old lady name once she's older.\n\nI myself have an old lady name, think Edith or something and it's a PAIN, kids in grade school constantly called me grandma Edith and the sort, saying I was destined to be an old hag who would live in the woods and have a crooked nose.\n\nI'm also worried for the baby, Bea isn't a reliable person, she's been sober for years and everyone still walks on eggshells around her, she used to run off to go on drug binges all the time, a few times leaving me home alone as a kid so she could meet one of her dealers while our parents where out. \n\nShe brought it up a few days ago, mentioning how she was hurt I didn't like the name and asked if I was being honest in my feelings. I told her I was, Mary is a fucking stupid name, she'll get bullied in school for it or at the very least if she goes to some kind of christian school it'll confused the hell out of her because every other girl will be called Mary.\n\nShe called me cruel and an asshole and accused me of hating her and not caring that she was finally in a good place in life. As if she hasn't been \"in a good place in life\" before and relapsed, leaving our parents in debt paying for therapy and rehab that don't work and letting us clean up all her messes over and over again.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Though Pacifica did tell Mabel that her name sounded like an old lady's name when they first met \ud83d\ude02", "I was just about to comment this! It's based on Epiphany, but unfortunately it's equated so much with modern times that if you made a movie/TV show set in medieval times with a character named Tiffany, watchers wouldn't be able to buy it as chronologically accurate.", "Yeah, there\u2019s only so much the sister can do to make up for the wrongs in the past. Ultimately, OP has to take care of her trauma, even if she doesn\u2019t forgive her sister.", "This. OP needs therapy or to move on...it's not fair to keep holding her past against her to this extent. \n\nAnd I'm not denying that OP suffered, but her sister's crimes seem to be that she stressed her parents out, cost them money, etc. It doesn't seem like the sister was abusive and it seems like the people who suffered most were the parents. If the parents forgave her and move on, the OP really needs to reconsider all her anger.", "Why be one of those people who comment this on posts?\n\nOr you actually seriously think THIS post is so wild it just has to be made up?!", "My name is Mary. I would just recite my own version of that nursery rhyme back at them, \u201cWith silver bells and cockle shells and really cute guys all in a row.\u201d\n\nBecause what do I want with pretty maids?\n\nNever really got teased again.", "My middle name is Mary and no kids even knew my middle name growing up. Why were you telling them what it was?", "Lavinya  is actually a family name for me! My grandma is Esther Lavinya!", "Cora is a great name and more people should use it.", "Sure was.", "There was a reboot??? I had no idea (I dont live in the US). I am definitely going to have to look that up!", "Yup, I actually like the long version of the name, Theophania, better! \ud83d\ude06", "My initials were almost ASS but that would have been quite intentional.", "My brother's initials actually are A.S.S lmao. I joke about it all the time, but luckily he's good about it. They weren't when he was born, but mum remarried, my dad adopted him, and they changed my siblings' surname.", "Was your friend finger lickin' good?", "For someone who says they've lived through it, you could be a bit more sympathetic to OP.", "If people still walk on eggshells around her somethings up", "And I got help. I couldn't have done it without help.\n\nOP can get help too."]}
