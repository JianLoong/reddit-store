This girl has been terrible for years. My Dad had a heart condition and ultimately got a transplant. She was there when he died (for exchanged services).  Back up a year. She called my sister and said \"Check on your Dad because I think he's going to die\". We couldn't get a hold of him and I asked her why she left him if he needed medical attention. She said \"I'm a single Mom, I have to go to work\". We didn't know what to do, call an ambulance? Where? She told me he was a stalker and could not stop seeing her and that he has an impulsive disorder that makes him see her. He paid her monthly rent, a new car, anything her child needed including dirt bikes and such. How does he stalk her if she goes to him for money and is the one that goes over to him house? Note, she is also in a relationship with another man that she says is her soul mate on Facebook. From what I am told she does this with lots of men. Anyways, I said you cannot come because this is a private event for family and close friends. We are doing a family sideshow with us girls growing up and exchanging memories, potluck style. It would not appropriate for someone like her to be there when everyone hated that she played with my Dad's feelings/heart and disrespected him so badly. He tried to leave her. She even cut herself and sent pictures saying she hurt herself because he wouldn't answer texts or calls. Her response after I said not to come \n\n\" I get your upset and I\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t understand what Andy and I shared. \nI can agree it was toxic at times but the bond and love we shared for one another was a connection that was unbreakable he was my best friend but also my sons best friend. \nI\u2019m sorry if you are uncomfortable believing, I don\u2019t want to make any of you uncomfortable as this is a hard time for many people.\n(Including my family)\u2026..\nCould we please keep this about what\u2019s really important and that is your father. \nBelieve me, I feel uncomfortable just as well as any of you, but if I didn\u2019t go, I know for a fact that man would roll over in his grave so I will be attending, and I will also be doing a horse carriage drawn with my mother For his funeral as it was his wish.\nI am sorry, but this is all hard on everyone and I hope nothing but peace, love and happiness and most importantly strength to you and your family.
