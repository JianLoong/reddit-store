Force of habit and wanting to keep the peace are powerful impulses. But you do need to break that cycle sooner or later and now is a good opportunity to do it. \n\nYour parents may do an \"extinction burst\" -- they have learned that emotional blackmail and nasty texts *work* on you, so when they sense you are setting real limits, they will likely double and triple down on that tactic. You need to stay strong. If you and your GF move on to other life events together, such as getting married or having kids (although that's not to assume you want either), this is only going to get worse. As painful and difficult as it may be, you should nip this in the bud now.", "My advice in these situations is... Just don't answer the phone. Don't respond to the texts. Call and text as often as you feel is respectful or as often as you want. If they berate or guilt trip you, say you need to get off the phone then get off the phone. Don't respond to similar texts. Change the subject as if you're having a normal conversation even if they are not. If they verbally abuse you, tell them that you aren't able to continue the conversation if they are talking to you like that. Make plans, sure, make them feel appreciated, but do it on your terms. I tell myself, anger is air. It's air passed over vocal cords, out the mouth, carried across vibrations of air molecules and then it dissipates. That's all it is. And if they want to spend their time angry, they can do that! You don't have to! How awful it must be to get wound up all the time, to live like that! But let those words carry through the air past you. Have the conversation you want to have. It's their choice to live life like that, but you don't have to.\n\nRemarkably, asserting boundaries like that often results in people changing how they treat you. If they decide to be so insulted they no longer want to talk to or see you, well, then, why would you want them in your life? (I acknowledge that this can be painful, but is it more painful than being treated like crap by your parents?) Or they will come to the realization that the only way they will have a relationship with you is to respect your boundaries. This may sound demeaning but I've discovered that interacting with difficult people is much like dealing with children or animals. The same techniques you would use to teach a child what is appropriate and what is not are incredibly effective in dealing with intractable adults. \n\nBe respectful, be compassionate, but be firm.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "Did either of your sets of parents visited their own parents every weekend when they were your age?

But if you're getting guilt trips, its a sign that its become a problem.\n\nHonestly, when you are all moved in and don't need them helping you work on the house, I'd suggest taking a break from spending any time with either set for a month or two. You might have to compromise and do a mid-week dinner or two with each set. But reserve the weekends for yourself.\n\nTwo months would be a good amount to start establishing a new pattern. Not just of not visiting, nut of filling your weekends with your own plans.\n\nOnce you've done so, you may find it easier to be control how often you visit, without getting grief over it in the process.", "NTA. and this is just the beginning my dude. your parents expectations are insanely unrealistic.\n\nI\u2019m you, 15 years in the future. We are NC with my in laws because of their unreasonable and unhinged behaviour due to their unrealistic expectations. It all kicked off when we bought our first place and went fully off the rails when we had our first baby. Good luck. You\u2019re going to need it.", "NTA. They can be upset if they like, but you're adults with responsibilities. Set the expectation of you'll visit once a month and if they want to visit once a month to help you with the house, great. Don't go on guilt trips. This is a really exciting time in your life. Enjoy it.", "NTA, and your parents don\u2019t need to know how often you visit girlfriend\u2019s parents. Don\u2019t tell them and don\u2019t post that shit on social media. What hey don\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them.", "NTA. I didn't even see my parents that much when I went to college and my campus was only 45 mins away. If it bothers them so much, tell them to come visit you and see how much they like making that trip every weekend.", "NTA, and it sounds like you should go ahead and set up some boundaries here. Not only do they seem to be struggling a bit with letting go and being empty nesters, the jealousy over the proximity of the GF's parents to you and how often you may get to see them is going to continue to be an issue. If you plan to have children, this might even get worse with the guilt trips and unnecessary comparisons of who gets to see who more often. I saw this happen with my family and would hate for you to go through that. If possible, definitely don't enable that behavior by changing your mind if they get upset - you are an adult. Good luck!", "NTA And please tell me you're setting it up to have a spare room so you can tell your parents that now they can visit you every other weekend instead!", "Dude not to sound harsh but you are an adult, time to cut the chord. 50 minutes is not that far away, there\u2019s no reason to go over there every weekend and not be able to go back to your own home and sleep in your own bed. I think it\u2019s incredibly important to spend time with both sets of parents but for you to go over there just to spend most of your time there while they are out is a bit silly. It would make more sense to go there maybe once or twice a month and plan activities with them and spend some quality time with them as that would be more meaningful. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  They're gonna have to get used to it eventually.  If you guys have kids I really don't see you dragging a baby over to their house to hang out when they're not even there.  They don't wanna face the empty nest, I get it, but.... they're gonna have to.", "NTA. You have to live your life. My 75 year old dad lives 15 minutes away from me and he sees me once a month (I talk several times a day though because I am overly anxious and need to know he's ok) lol. My dad would be annoyed if I wanted to stay over every weekend lol. I stayed overnight on Christmas eve and another time when he had a medical issue and I didn't want to leave him alone. Once in a while, I do mention wanting to stay over because I miss living there and he is cool with that if I wanna go. My dad is a widower so I'm glad he enjoys his own company  (I joke about him being a hotline because he's constantly chatting on the phone with his retired friends). I probably get my introvert nature from him.", "ES - \n\nAre you an only child? that they think your life , even now , should revolve around them and vice versa.\n\nThe word 'NO' is amazing - you'll have to try it soon.  If you can't use it, what on earth did you buy this house with a partner for, when you're not available for partnership!", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised your girlfriend is okay with this, cause I would not be okay with spending every weekend with my in-laws. I have shit to do. And I\u2019m also pretty introverted. What happens when you have kids? Parents job is to raise kids so they can successfully fly the nest, not come home every weekend (unless they want to). Do you guys not have hobbies or groups you are in or anything that would occur on weekends? \n\nI have a different view on this cause I see my parents maybe 3 times a year due to distance. I have friends that their parents expect them to come home often (cause they are single and childless) and it blows my mind. People still have lives.", "NTA.  I would tell them it would be great if they came your way. Then, they could possibly help and see the progress.  They are ridiculous, expecting you to come home every weekend.", "NTA, your parents need to accept that you've moved away and their request is unreasonable AF, you're an adult now, they need to let go.", "NTA you have to move out sometime. it sounds like they don't want to accept that fact. you've grown up and have a life  and they can no longer be the center of it.", "NTA - Tell your parents if they would like to see you, they are welcome to come and lend a hand with the renovations.", "NTA but cut the cord and grow a backbone. You don't need to spend every weekend at your parents house, especially sleeping there. Be an adult and set some boundaries.", "NTA and they\u2019re being ridiculous. Are you really supposed to give up every weekend to see your parents? You don\u2019t get to go out together, chill around the house, grocery shop, or whatever all else people do on weekends? Ever? What planet do these people live on?", "NTA. Every weekend is ridiculous.  Once a month is way more than plenty.  Time to set some boundaries, \u201cif you guys bring this up one more time, I might come see you in a year.\u201d", "NTA for prioritizing yourself at all. However it is unusual for adult children to stay the night at their parents house every weekend outside of special holiday events, especially seeing as you\u2019re only an hour away.", "The road goes in both directions.  If they want to see you, let them come over & help out with your house.", "Stop giving them excuses. You don\u2019t need a reason to reside in your home. After your house is done, you are going to be even more inclined to want to stay in it. Tell them you\u2019re an adult now and it\u2019s time to cut the cord.  NTA", "Yes, giving explanations, etc. just gives the other party ammo, no matter who the other party is, especially if the other party is manipulative.", "We moved over an hour north of our families and we go down to see them all the time for dinner or they come up just because everybody wants to come hang out in the country. Husband's birthday was a few weeks ago and we drove down to meet everybody for dinner, turned around and came back afterwards. I don't understand people's obsession with not driving lol", "Exactly.   When I moved from an 8 hour drive away from my my parents to an hour drive I quit staying the night.", "Talk to them. Tell them once a quarter", "I think in cases like this instead of telling them what you *won't* do, tell them what you *will* do. So decide with your gf what you're both comfortable with - maybe a family dinner once a week or every other week. Or \"family time\" for 4 hours once a month. I think it should be very specific since they're not being reasonable and you need to break this cycle.", "You need to put some harsh boundaries with your parents, asap. Imagine how they will be once you have kids...", "If they're like mine, you may have to give them a taste of what \"never here\" actually looks like. Maybe be too busy to see them at all for a couple months.", "Next time they do it just pack up and go home. When they get back and call you, tell them \"well you didn't want to spend time with us so we figured the visit was over\". \n\nThis is absolutely manipulative on their part! They want you to spend a whole weekend doing nothing but spending time with them, while they do anything they want that has nothing to do with you. Why do you have to give, but they don't? \n\nMaybe if you only went one weekend a month they would bother to spend all the time with you. Seems to me like you're spending too much time there, to the point that they don't feel like a visit from you is special...so why should they stay home to actually visit with you?\n\nEdited because talk to text apparently hates me!", "Right?! A stay-home, do-nothing weekend is my absolute favorite!", "Right? I see my parents a few times a year. Our relationship is good, but like... we all have shit going on on the weekends. We have lives!", "Stay over because the car ride is 50 minutes? I sometimes go shopping at a mall which is further away, but I don't spend the night...\n\nYou can work on your house on Saturdays, drive to your parents for dinner (saves you cooking time ;-) ) drive home after dinner and spend Sundays working on your house again.", "You realize you're not required to visit your family like... Ever? Time to grow up and cut the strings.", "NTA. Do you not ever want to just do your own thing and see zero parents (hers or yours) on the weekend? It must be hell living like this. I genuinely don\u2019t understand and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s working for you.", "I\u2019m a little confused. You and gf are moving in together and just bought a house that you get the keys to in a little over a week. You\u2019re working on the house, and staying weekends at gf\u2019s parents house and your mom and dad are upset that you don\u2019t spend weekends with them, even though they go out socializing without you while you\u2019re there. \n\nWhere do you stay during the week? Are you working on the outside and once you\u2019ve closed you will spend April on the inside? Is this an extensive renovation or cosmetic?", "NTA. You had better work on setting boundaries now because your parents sound like the kind that will need to hear it several hundred times before they believe you mean what you say.", "I live in an area with lots of traffic and depending On time of day going 10 miles takes 45 min. Why on gods green earth do you have to spend the night. Your grown adults. Go have dinner after work on a weekday, occasionally. 50 miles is not that far. Ridiculous for them to demand your time like that what happens when you have children? It\u2019s time to set some boundaries and learn to say No.", "We live 3 hours from family and see them all time and don\u2019t always sleep over. When we lived 45 min away we NEVER slept over.", "NTA. Visiting your parents every weekend and spending the night is huge overkill, even when your house repairs are done.", "NTA. Probably buy a bed though, seems like a good investment.", "NTA - I would start having panic attacks if I had to stay at someone else's house every weekend. I need recovery time to just chill and not socialise or do anything, I don't know how you've coped with their excessive codependency", "This is not normal. Your parents are creepily controlling.  Go live your own life.\n\nNTA", "The reasons behind their behavior are issues for them to handle, not you. \n\nNTA.  **Their behavior is unreasonable.**  Parents of grown children should not expect their grown children to come back to visit every weekend.  That's a burdensome level of expectations.  It sounds like it's more about their control than anything else, if they aren't even spending the time with you.  If you wanted to do this, that'd be different.  But when it's expected, that's taking away your control over your life.  It's not right.\n\n**Don't wait for April to stop going over there on weekends.  Stop now.  Spend your remaining weekends \"packing\"** and getting your old place ready to move out of, while you wait to have access to move in.  And **don't explain your reasons.**  \"Sorry, we can't come this weekend.  It doesn't work for us.\"  \"Why not?  Because it doesn't work for us.\"  \"I already told you our decision.   I'm not going to discuss this further.\"  \"I see you want to discuss this, when you know I don't, so I'll hang up now.  Love you bye.\" \n\n**Don't promise that you will start visiting so often after you get the house settled.**  Instead, be vague.  \"We'll have to see how it goes.\"  \"Well, as adults, we have a lot to do now.\"  \"We will have to see what's on our agenda and get back to you.\"  \n\n**Get out of the habit of discussing this topic at all.**  \"Let's talk about other things today.\"  \"Nope, not talking about this.\" \n\n**After you get some time to be out of the habit of going there all the time, you two can decide for yourselves how often you want to see them.**  Once a month, at their house or yours?  A couple of hours or an afternoon?  If they can't adjust to that, maybe less and less until they realize that it's not up to them how often you visit, it's your decision.\n\n**You are adult enough to buy a house.  That means that you are adult enough to make all your own decisions now.**  You know your needs, your chores, your goals, your job, your schedule, everything.  You know how many other people you want to see.  You know what other things you might want to become involved in, that you couldn't do before when you were giving them all your weekends.  It's reasonable to take that control, over your schedule and time, away from them and their demands, and back into your hands.  \n\n**If they are looking for control, they won't like it.  That's okay.  They don't have to like it.**  What they do have to do is stop bringing it up, or you can end any call, any visit, when they won't respect that your decisions are for you to make now, not them.\n\nMy kids are all over thirty.  I respect their decisions as being theirs.  I do not ask for reasons when they state a decision.  If they want to tell me, they will.  Respect is how to show your adult kids that you love them.  It's not hard.", "Definitely NTA. But now is time to set boundaries. Perhaps they are having leaving the nest syndrome. But that\u2019s not your problem, and it\u2019s frankly ridiculous to expect you to be there very weekend. I\u2019d be lucky if I could manage once a month.\n\nSquander it now. And don\u2019t cave to twice a month or whatever. They need to accept your an adult and are living your own life now.", "NTA. Traveling every weekend is a logical pain in the assumption, and having to give up your own projects to do it is the Worst.", "NTA. Don't be scared to set boundaries. You're an adult with your own home a bit away and it sounds like your parents are just having a little bit trouble adjusting.\n\n\nMaybe set up like a weekly phone call or video meeting?

Congratulations to you and your gf on the new house!!", "NTA and even if you weren't working on your new house, they have no right to demand you stay with them every weekend or every other weekend or ever at all. You are an adult. You will have a home with your girlfriend. She should be your priority, not your parents. Until your parents back off and allow you to live your own life, under your rules, not theirs. you will probably need to limit contact of any kind with them.  My mother was the same way. She and my father moved to a different town, then expected me to go there every Saturday to give her company. She didn't care that I was married with 4 kids, working opposite shifts (usually more than 40 hours per week) of my husband so really only seeing him on weekends. It took a long time for her to understand that I was not going to go to her house just because she demanded it. You have a girlfriend. You owe more of your free time to your girlfriend than to your mother. Keep telling her no. It will eventually sink in.", "Your parents are being manipulative. Watching your kids grow up means they will do adult things  - like buy a house and live their own lives. They want to keep you as the child if they have you visit and then go out. \n\nReality is you are an adult and will build your own family now whether that be just you and your partner or children. And life will change. NTA Put a boundary in place now around behaviour and expectations.", "NTA\nPlain and simple: they don't want you to live on your own, or move further away. I had to go through this with my parents when I moved from the south to the Northeast.

Focus on that, and your new life.", "NTA, you grew up with them, time for pouring in to your own life. You are doing it right!", "NTA.

They need to cut the umbilical cord.", "Yeah, to be clear, you would be NTA if you wanted to do x instead of visit your parents all weekend, where x is anything other than things that would make your an asshole without the \"instead of visiting my parents\".
