I have already addressed them several times that we will be very busy during the month of April and will probably have little time to visit them often.

I am almost tempted to give you one of those \"Y T A to yourself\" judgments because no way in hell would I give up every weekend of my life to people who can't bother to make time to actually see me!\n\nI understand what you mean. I think we did it more to please them and not feel like hearing \"you are never there\" every time after spending the previous 3 weekends at my girlfriend's parents.

Force of habit and wanting to keep the peace are powerful impulses. But you do need to break that cycle sooner or later and now is a good opportunity to do it. \n\nYour parents may do an \"extinction burst\" -- they have learned that emotional blackmail and nasty texts *work* on you, so when they sense you are setting real limits, they will likely double and triple down on that tactic. You need to stay strong. If you and your GF move on to other life events together, such as getting married or having kids (although that's not to assume you want either), this is only going to get worse. As painful and difficult as it may be, you should nip this in the bud now.", "My advice in these situations is... Just don't answer the phone. Don't respond to the texts. Call and text as often as you feel is respectful or as often as you want. If they berate or guilt trip you, say you need to get off the phone then get off the phone. Don't respond to similar texts. Change the subject as if you're having a normal conversation even if they are not. If they verbally abuse you, tell them that you aren't able to continue the conversation if they are talking to you like that. Make plans, sure, make them feel appreciated, but do it on your terms. I tell myself, anger is air. It's air passed over vocal cords, out the mouth, carried across vibrations of air molecules and then it dissipates. That's all it is. And if they want to spend their time angry, they can do that! You don't have to! How awful it must be to get wound up all the time, to live like that! But let those words carry through the air past you. Have the conversation you want to have. It's their choice to live life like that, but you don't have to.\n\nRemarkably, asserting boundaries like that often results in people changing how they treat you. If they decide to be so insulted they no longer want to talk to or see you, well, then, why would you want them in your life? (I acknowledge that this can be painful, but is it more painful than being treated like crap by your parents?) Or they will come to the realization that the only way they will have a relationship with you is to respect your boundaries. This may sound demeaning but I've discovered that interacting with difficult people is much like dealing with children or animals. The same techniques you would use to teach a child what is appropriate and what is not are incredibly effective in dealing with intractable adults. \n\nBe respectful, be compassionate, but be firm.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "Did either of your sets of parents visited their own parents every weekend when they were your age?
