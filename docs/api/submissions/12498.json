Force of habit and wanting to keep the peace are powerful impulses. But you do need to break that cycle sooner or later and now is a good opportunity to do it. \n\nYour parents may do an \"extinction burst\" -- they have learned that emotional blackmail and nasty texts *work* on you, so when they sense you are setting real limits, they will likely double and triple down on that tactic. You need to stay strong. If you and your GF move on to other life events together, such as getting married or having kids (although that's not to assume you want either), this is only going to get worse. As painful and difficult as it may be, you should nip this in the bud now.", "My advice in these situations is... Just don't answer the phone. Don't respond to the texts. Call and text as often as you feel is respectful or as often as you want. If they berate or guilt trip you, say you need to get off the phone then get off the phone. Don't respond to similar texts. Change the subject as if you're having a normal conversation even if they are not. If they verbally abuse you, tell them that you aren't able to continue the conversation if they are talking to you like that. Make plans, sure, make them feel appreciated, but do it on your terms. I tell myself, anger is air. It's air passed over vocal cords, out the mouth, carried across vibrations of air molecules and then it dissipates. That's all it is. And if they want to spend their time angry, they can do that! You don't have to! How awful it must be to get wound up all the time, to live like that! But let those words carry through the air past you. Have the conversation you want to have. It's their choice to live life like that, but you don't have to.\n\nRemarkably, asserting boundaries like that often results in people changing how they treat you. If they decide to be so insulted they no longer want to talk to or see you, well, then, why would you want them in your life? (I acknowledge that this can be painful, but is it more painful than being treated like crap by your parents?) Or they will come to the realization that the only way they will have a relationship with you is to respect your boundaries. This may sound demeaning but I've discovered that interacting with difficult people is much like dealing with children or animals. The same techniques you would use to teach a child what is appropriate and what is not are incredibly effective in dealing with intractable adults. \n\nBe respectful, be compassionate, but be firm.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "Did either of your sets of parents visited their own parents every weekend when they were your age?

But if you're getting guilt trips, its a sign that its become a problem.\n\nHonestly, when you are all moved in and don't need them helping you work on the house, I'd suggest taking a break from spending any time with either set for a month or two. You might have to compromise and do a mid-week dinner or two with each set. But reserve the weekends for yourself.\n\nTwo months would be a good amount to start establishing a new pattern. Not just of not visiting, nut of filling your weekends with your own plans.\n\nOnce you've done so, you may find it easier to be control how often you visit, without getting grief over it in the process.", "NTA. and this is just the beginning my dude. your parents expectations are insanely unrealistic.\n\nI\u2019m you, 15 years in the future. We are NC with my in laws because of their unreasonable and unhinged behaviour due to their unrealistic expectations.

They can be upset if they like, but you're adults with responsibilities. Set the expectation of you'll visit once a month and if they want to visit once a month to help you with the house, great. Don't go on guilt trips. This is a really exciting time in your life. Enjoy it.", "NTA, and your parents don\u2019t need to know how often you visit girlfriend\u2019s parents.

If it bothers them so much, tell them to come visit you and see how much they like making that trip every weekend.", "NTA, and it sounds like you should go ahead and set up some boundaries here. Not only do they seem to be struggling a bit with letting go and being empty nesters, the jealousy over the proximity of the GF's parents to you and how often you may get to see them is going to continue to be an issue. If you plan to have children, this might even get worse with the guilt trips and unnecessary comparisons of who gets to see who more often. I saw this happen with my family and would hate for you to go through that. If possible, definitely don't enable that behavior by changing your mind if they get upset - you are an adult. Good luck!", "NTA And please tell me you're setting it up to have a spare room so you can tell your parents that now they can visit you every other weekend instead!", "Dude not to sound harsh but you are an adult, time to cut the chord. 50 minutes is not that far away, there\u2019s no reason to go over there every weekend and not be able to go back to your own home and sleep in your own bed. I think it\u2019s incredibly important to spend time with both sets of parents but for you to go over there just to spend most of your time there while they are out is a bit silly. It would make more sense to go there maybe once or twice a month and plan activities with them and spend some quality time with them as that would be more meaningful. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Once in a while, I do mention wanting to stay over because I miss living there and he is cool with that if I wanna go.

I\u2019m surprised your girlfriend is okay with this, cause I would not be okay with spending every weekend with my in-laws. I have shit to do. And I\u2019m also pretty introverted.

Do you guys not have hobbies or groups you are in or anything that would occur on weekends? \n\nI have a different view on this cause I see my parents maybe 3 times a year due to distance. I have friends that their parents expect them to come home often (cause they are single and childless) and it blows my mind. People still have lives.", "NTA.

Why do you have to give, but they don't? \n\nMaybe if you only went one weekend a month they would bother to spend all the time with you.

That's a burdensome level of expectations.  It sounds like it's more about their control than anything else, if they aren't even spending the time with you.  If you wanted to do this, that'd be different.  But when it's expected, that's taking away your control over your life.  It's not right.\n\n**Don't wait for April to stop going over there on weekends.  Stop now.

A couple of hours or an afternoon?  If they can't adjust to that, maybe less and less until they realize that it's not up to them how often you visit, it's your decision.\n\n**You are adult enough to buy a house.  That means that you are adult enough to make all your own decisions now.**  You know your needs, your chores, your goals, your job, your schedule, everything.  You know how many other people you want to see.  You know what other things you might want to become involved in, that you couldn't do before when you were giving them all your weekends.  It's reasonable to take that control, over your schedule and time, away from them and their demands, and back into your hands.  \n\n**If they are looking for control, they won't like it.  That's okay.  They don't have to like it.**  What they do have to do is stop bringing it up, or you can end any call, any visit, when they won't respect that your decisions are for you to make now, not them.\n\nMy kids are all over thirty.  I respect their decisions as being theirs.  I do not ask for reasons when they state a decision.  If they want to tell me, they will.  Respect is how to show your adult kids that you love them.  It's not hard.", "Definitely NTA. But now is time to set boundaries. Perhaps they are having leaving the nest syndrome.

She and my father moved to a different town, then expected me to go there every Saturday to give her company. She didn't care that I was married with 4 kids, working opposite shifts (usually more than 40 hours per week) of my husband so really only seeing him on weekends.

It's not your home.", "Do not give them keys or leave keys in range where they could \"borrow\" them either.", "This is absolutely what I would do.\n\n\"Oh, you're going to dinner/a concert/a movie? You had tickets for an event & already had plans? Why am I here then??\"\n\nIt would happen one time.", "Nta, I love my boyfriends family but staying over every weekend for years would kill me", "NTA. In what universe would you ever spend every weekend having weird slumber parties at your parents\u2019 house? Time to lay down the law. No weekend visits until they stop sniveling.", "NTA. Sounds like your parents are having trouble watching you move toward a more independent life apart from them. Love them but keep your very reasonable boundary. And hold it some more. Eventually they will adjust, so long as you don\u2019t cave", "NTA but boy O boy do you need to take steps to stop not only this behavior but the future behavior you're headed in to. You need to confront them even stronger, or you will end up being beholding to them for all of their wishes and wants. \n\nYou need to tell them that \"their pressures to visit them is making you resentful of their pressure and making you not to want to even be around them.  It is a parent's responsibility to raise their kids to be self-supporting independent adults. It is not a parent's job to make their children have to take time out of their efforts to set up their life just so the parents can be entertained. You as parents should not be getting in our way of us setting ourselves up for the future. It should be you coming to us, not you being dependent on us to come to you when we have other things going on.  You are being so demanding that I don't even want to see you for a while because you're so demanding. Aside from us living with his parents us being there is the fact that they make being around them less stressful and put few demands on us. They don't get in our way they try to be helpful even if being helpful is them giving us room and staying way when we are working.\"  \n\nThey are going to want you to put in most of the effort to keep them happy even when you have children and are not getting sleep and just about ready to pull your hair out. So don't be so to kind towards them so you don't end up hearing \"you don't love us anymore\" or \"you love them more than us\" etc etc or you will resent them and not want be around them anymore if you don't set fairly firm boundaries. If they drop by unannounced while you are working, hand them a dish towel or a broom or a paint brush and \"help us finish this so we can sit down and visit.\"  Also if their in-laws are still around, ask them if they acted this way and see how your MIL acted toward them to see if there are differences that were more accommodating.\n\nJust remember that you need to set boundaries so that you live your life without resentment on what you should have done so that being around them is making your life pleasurable or at the very least bearable.", "I'm sorry but keeping the peace has made you a doormat", "The home they will be putting work into. They don't get the keys for another 10 days. \n\nThe weird thing is that OP and his girlfriend have always been fine with staying at his parents' house every weekend up until this point. The behavior OP describes definitely isn't normal.", "Because what you\u2019re describing is silly, and you\u2019re making this whole situation worse for yourself.  Paint the guest room, move the bed, and stay in the guest room in *your house* with your girlfriend until the main bedroom is ready. \n\nWhen my husband and I bought our house we literally slept on the floor in the living room the first few nights", "This - my now DH and i slept on the floor of our new apartment starting the first day we got it.  We had a card table and a little borrowed tv with lawn chairs.   And privacy!", "NTA do they expect you to go to their house - and *spend the night there one of your two weekend nights -* every single blessed weekend for the rest of your life?\n\nShut this down, OP.  Stop making it about the house and the work you need to do.  Your time is your time, and you are making a life with your partner.  Tell your parents it is time for you to come visit them monthly, not weekly.  They're lucky to be getting that.  You are young and you have a life to live and shit to do and fun to have.", "NTA- You guys get to have adult lives \u2013 which absolutely does not mean spending every weekend at your parents.", "NTA My son and DIL (and 20 month old baby) are fixing up their \"new\" house. Of course I understand that they can't use all their free weekends visiting me. They live 2 1/2 hours away by car and ferry. And they understand that the drive and staying there are tiring for me. So we alternate months, generally. I visit them one month, and they come to me one month. Their parents are only an hour away?! I WISH! We have one-night visits usually, sometimes two. His parents could make WAY more of an effort. Why don't they come help???", "NTA, your parents sound like children in all of this.", "NTA. Most people don\u2019t spend every weekend at their parent\u2019s house after they move out. Time to cut the strings and get your parents used to the new normal where you live in your own house and maybe see them once a month.", "NTA Time to cut those strings\nYou have things that need to be done and can only do them on your day off. They are more than welcome to come to your house as long as they understand you won't be sitting down to visit. You el be busy. You can probably take time to visit in Sunday after brunch.", "YTA.  Time to grow up and be independent.   You're an adult now, so that means you tell your family when and how your visit will go.", "So quit the constant parental visits to both sides?!  Live your lives!", "THIS OMG.  This literally makes every weekend a complete wash.  Girlfriend is a saint.", "Dude you are young, just get sleeping bags.", "Nta. Tell your parents you have your own life to live. They will need to learn to entertain themselves.", "I haven't seen my parents in years since I moved to the east coast. I miss them immensely but I'm to broke to be able to get out to CA. OP definitely doesn't need to go out there every frickin weekend. NTA.", "Love. This."]}
