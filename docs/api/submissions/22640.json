That's hard and unpleasant emotional labor with some significant drawbacks, as seen with her broken things.\n\nYour response to her frustration at how hard the work was and how high the personal costs to herself were was to mock her for trying.

If not, why aren't his parents getting him help or trying anything more to curb this? For 13, I wouldn't allow him to partake or really do much until he learns.

Ever heard of a kid changing their entire life around because a TEACHER believed in them even when no one else would and the teacher wouldn't tolerate their crap? Parents some times fail. Why should children be destined to suffer and lead a miserable life because they ended up with parents who were incapable of raising them? \n\nYes. Some times things happen. Struggling kids act out. Teenagers act out. Extreme emotions. Independent enough to have their own thoughts and know what's going on but too young to help themselves or to do anything about their situation. It's okay to complain about something that happens as a result of a troubled kid you took in (knowing it's a likelihood they'll act out). The right thing to do wouldn't have been to dismiss someone and said basically \"F u I was right. F U I was right\". There's no community in that. It would've been \"Yeah. That sucks and I expected that to happen. But was there something that triggered him? Did you tell him no to something or did he get angry over something? Was he irritable when he broke stuff?\" Etc. That's still family. Parents don't have a guidebook.  They screw up and have struggles of their own. Think about how crappy this entire world is. Would it still be that way if there was community? Humanity? Kindness? Empathy? Understanding? Kids raised in good homes with good role models who didn't treat them like an outcast, outsider or burden? Parents do need to take responsibility for their children if they break things. However family like grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, the community ALL mold a child into who they become.", "I think it really just comes down to being risk aware.

It's not necessary to boost your ego and talk crap about a 13 year old kid. Turning into a teenager is a part of my life I never want to relive. Yes, actions have consequences.

However, they need to build their relationship with that child if they want things to change. For example, \"hey. It's hot out today, so I was thinking maybe (13 year old) would want to get some ice cream with me. Can you ask him? I'll come pick him up. Just wanna spend time with my nephew\" and when a movie comes out \"hey. Do you think (nephew) would like this movie? Would it be okay if I took him out to the movies and spent some time with him?\" \"Hey kiddo. Would you like to just get out of the house? I was thinking we could head to the bowling alley and play a couple games? You'll probably beat me because I'm not very good at bowling. It beats being stuck at home though\"\n\nAnd gradually building that relationship to \"hey. I was wondering if \"nephew\" would wanna stay over for the weekend. I was thinking I could take him to the fair (or amusement park) and maybe out to breakfast the next morning?\" Of course, as the relationship grows (ideally the kid voicing \"can we go to your house?) Then you could tell him \"yeah. We can go to my house, but you have to abide by my rules and not break anything when you're over. As long as you respect myself and my things like I respect you, I'll be happy to bring you over\"", "Surely you can say I told you so but then ALSO give advice, commiseration or offer to help.

It's gonna take more than one shot with a lot of kids for them to open up and be more transparent with you. Let them know what they're going through.

Kid may be struggling but not open to see a therapist assuming his parents would be willing (and able) for him to see one. When it comes to people (kids especially) they don't recieve well when it comes across as \"you're the problem\". And even then \"how do I help you?\" Isn't a question that can be easily answered by a struggling teen or anyone struggling for that matter. They know what they feel but don't always know why. What I wonder is how often do they try to spend time with the kid one on one? Take him out for ice cream? To the movies? Rollerblading? Bowling? Ice-skating? Kayaking? The park? To go see the lights at Christmas? Etc. They can bond with the kid through smaller things and attempts fairly frequently without taking the kid to their house and risking their stuff being broken. Heck, even just go for a walk to a convenient store or ice cream shop and talk to him. Be open with him. Talk about his parents. Tell him some funny kid stories from when you were growing up. Building a relationship takes time. Especially with someone who built up a wall around them to negate their struggles they don't know what to do with. But the kid needs to feel valued and at least respected like adults demand. It always starts out rocky but can gradually get better as you remain persistent. Letting them in without pressure. Without pushing that something is wrong. No judgement."]}
