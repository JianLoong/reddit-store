My partner is much more up beat than me so we balance out. \n\nNow my sister and I have a nephew, he is 13 and I\u2019m sad to say he is just a lot of trouble. Really waiting for him to grow out of it, his parents try but he is the type of kid that will blow out the birthday candles at a birthday party. Every time he goes somewhere he does something. \n\nNow there was a family get together and his parents couldn\u2019t come so he wasn\u2019t going. So my sister offered to take him and he could sleep at her place. I told her this was a bad idea. She ignored it and did the plan. \n\nShe called me this morning about how he was a terror at home and broke some of her stuff. I said, told you so and she called me a jerk.

The thing with siblings is that you completely get to smile and give them the \"I told you so\" without any AH label. It's your job to give good advice!", "YTA. What did saying \u201cI told you so\u201d accomplish, besides proving that you were right?\n\nAlso that whole \u201cNo good deed goes unpunished\u201d attitude is often just an excuse for self-proclaimed cynics to act selfishly. Being kind may backfire sometimes, but so does everything else. Why not err on the side of kindness and support?", "YTA,    being right has nothing to do with it.  what was the point of pointing out that you told her so except to be an asshole.   has there ever been a time when someone made that statement and wasn't being an asshole?   how is that a helpful comment.   you can be right and make yourself feel good by saying it but still be an asshole.", "Technically, NTA because you indeed were right and indeed did tell her so.\n\nBut how did your comment help? Did it feel good to say? If so, good for you. But I doubt that feeling lasted that long if you had to come to Reddit to ask if you were wrong.", "Just because you're right doesn't exclude you from being an asshole. YTA", "Gentle YTA. I get where you are coming from but the world needs more caring people than smug cynics. My psych professor said this in class and it always stuck with me: misery loves company, but company does not love misery.", "NTA. Nothing quite like someone ignoring flashing red lights that say \"do not enter, tiger will bite your face off\" and thinking, 'this doesn't apply to me' only for the tiger to bite your face off. The kid has a proven track record of bad behaviour and somehow your sister thought that this time would be different? Your sister had good intentions but good intentions don't fix bad behaviour. She willingly ignored his past behaviour and suffered for it.", "YTA.\n\n\"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.\"", "YTA very slightly. Your sister already knew it was a mistake to take him home. You could have kept quiet.", "NTA. Not sure about her sister, but some people like to be \"rescuers\" to look good. Sis had to know that this kid was trouble, but figured \"it's not his fault, it's that others don't know how to deal with him, and I know better\". \n\nAt the same time, OP could've just said \"I was afraid of that. Sorry to hear it didn't work out as you hoped\". But, I'll still stick to n t a.", "YTA. \n\n\u201cI told you so\u201d is very rarely said by non-assholes. It\u2019s just not really a kind or necessary thing to say. Okay, you were right, do you want a cookie? Your sister tried to be nice and help out family. She probably also anticipated nephew to behave badly, maybe just not *that* badly. Clearly you were right, but she already paid for that by dealing with nephews crappy behavior, you don\u2019t have to gloat about being right on top of it.", "ESH.\n\n\u201cI told you so,\u201d is rude, even if it\u2019s true. \n\nBut your family, like your sister in this instance, need to stop enabling your nephew. This is not normal 13 year old behavior. He needs help, and consequences. If he\u2019s going to keep acting like a terror, he shouldn\u2019t be brought along.", "NTA.

You are misinterpreting sacrifice as gullability, and using it to attack or criticize someone, when it seems she was asking for some emotional support after her sacrifice.", "NTA. \n\nBut I don't know what the point was either. Like, did you just need to be right and make sure she knew it?", "NTA kid sounds like a dick and it's his mums fault", "YTA.\n\n>  I said, told you so \n\nWhat did saying this accomplish?  What good thing did it contribute to the situation?  What was the point of this?  She already knew that you'd correctly predicted the outcome.", "YTA\n\nYes, your nephew is acting out.  Kids do that when something has gone wrong.  Often is isn't something they \"grow out of\" so much as it is something that gets corrected over time with LOTS of unseen emotional labor from family, friends, and the extended community or professional or judicial intervention.\n\nSaying you're waiting for him to grow out of it is announcing that you're waiting for someone else to solve the problem without doing anything to help your younger relative.\n\nYour sister is trying to be a positive adult figure in his life and include him in events that might help tip the scales in a more positive direction.  That's hard and unpleasant emotional labor with some significant drawbacks, as seen with her broken things.\n\nYour response to her frustration at how hard the work was and how high the personal costs to herself were was to mock her for trying.  Your cynicism is just an excuse to avoid trying to improve the family dynamic.", "Partial yta\n\nYou're not the asshole for being right, but you are for throwing it in her face. It was unnecessary and the last thing she needs right now.", "YTA. Your sister was trying to do something nice. She realized that the kid was out of control and was acknowledging it. The \"I told you so\" is rude on your part and really she didn't need to hear that. I'm sure she already felt bad enough. And thinking that \"no good deed goes unpunished\" is a really shitty attitude. A lot of them actually can really benefit you or at least the other person. So yeah you're a giant a.h imo.", "YTA just because you are right, doesn\u2019t mean people will like you.", "YTA\n\nShe called you to vent and you decided to be pretty, instead of comforting.

He's still a kid and while it would be nice to banish them from society we can't.", "\"I am sorry he destroyed some of your personal belongings. This is why I said before, 'I think this is a bad idea.' We've seen the way he behaves before. Until he learns to stop ruining things for others, I think it would be in our best interest not to have he spend nights at our homes. I hope he learns soon for all our sakes.\"", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYeah, you were right and did indeed tell her she would regret it. Doesn't make you any less of an AH for pointing it out. 5 years down the road, yeah, when everything has calmed down. It would be funnier then IF said in true humor. But when she is upset and trying to calm down? Nah, you're the AH all the way my dude.", "uh, frankly, I told you so coming from a sibling makes you more of an asshole, cause you're the last person they want to hear it from. it doesn't stop us from doing it, (sort of a necessity when you have siblings) but we're definitely still assholes for it.", "you can be 100% right and an asshole.", "The sister called OP to complain. The sister initiated the conversation in every way.", "Can\u2019t believe ESH when the sister was performing a good deed & was only venting. Sure the kid sounds a handful but that\u2019s on his parents, not his guardian for one night.", "Just because people don't like you, doesn't make you an asshole.", "\"Want\" and \"Need\" are different things.    -Singsongy", "Sure.  And even saying 'Now you understand why I counseled against it' is better than saying 'told you so.'\n\n'Told you so' is a combination of 'you're an idiot' and 'you should always do what I say.'", "And I said op was slightly TA.
