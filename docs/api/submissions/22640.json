That's hard and unpleasant emotional labor with some significant drawbacks, as seen with her broken things.\n\nYour response to her frustration at how hard the work was and how high the personal costs to herself were was to mock her for trying.

If not, why aren't his parents getting him help or trying anything more to curb this? For 13, I wouldn't allow him to partake or really do much until he learns.

If you care about someone you should want to be wrong in your cynical predictions not smugly pleased that you're right.\n\n>they need to learn to accept their consequences and improve their actions.\n\nImprove their actions by being a less kind and generous person? Most people wouldn't see that as an improvement", "If you don't want them to say \"I told you so\" the easiest solution is to not do the stupid shit you were warned by that person not to do. It's actually pretty easy and works 100% of the time. \n\nIf someone warns you about the consequences of your actions and you choose to proceed anyway you have earned being told \"I told you so\" if you choose to complain about what you knowingly signed up for as its also one of the consequences of doing something foolish.", "you can be 100% right and an asshole.", ">hey already know what happened. They don't need someone to tell them\n\nYes, they do. Them feeling bad is how they learn and remember not to make that mistake or one like it again. It's literally how people learn. Babysitting the nephew is a mistake and learning not to do it is important.\n\n>Improve their actions by being a less kind and generous person?\n\nDoing something stupid because it's \"kind and generous\" isn't being kind and generous, it's being stupid.", "Though she suffered consequences, the sister still did the right thing bringing the nephew, I don't think abandoning family members, even if they are trouble, is not the right answer, especially a minor.", "I always say if you don\u2019t want to be embarrassed by your actions when I tell stories about memories and stuff, stop doing dumb shit you\u2019re getting embarrassed by. \u2026I say it to my mother a lot \ud83d\ude02", ">It's literally how people learn.\n\nNumerous studies would tell you otherwise. People learn better through positive reinforcement.\n\n>Doing something stupid because it's \"kind and generous\" isn't being kind and generous, it's being stupid.\n\nA generous action that goes south is still generous.\n\nOP's sister got some stuff broken, OP is creating a division between herself and her family. Making yourself unpleasant to be around is a pretty stupid action.\n\nAnyway, not really interested in hearing your toxic viewpoint any more. Hope you grow out of it and learn to have some generosity in your soul.", "YTA.\n\n\"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.\""]}
