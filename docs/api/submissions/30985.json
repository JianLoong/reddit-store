Over a month ago they casually mentioned over a Zoom call that they were \"thinking\" the trip would be two weeks long. My wife and I, feeling caught off guard by the length of the trip said \"Oh that would be fun.\"  \n\nWeeks went by but we hadn't heard anything else, we assumed they were still looking at flights & planning the trip. I finally texted & said, \"We still need to figure out your trip in December.\" They responded with \"Are there any questions we can answer for you now?\" To which I said \"Yeah, have you already purchased tickets & if so, when?\" It turns out they had already purchased tickets & were planning on staying at our house for 2 weeks, without ever running dates by us, checking if we had talked about it, or if that amount of time would work with our schedules.  \n\nAfter learning they already got tickets I said that time frame should work for us but \"we need to figure out all the details and logistics.\" My wife & I agreed that for us & our family, having visitors stay with us for two weeks is a lot. Our compromise is for them to stay with us for 9 days while my wife & I are off from work & our kids aren't in school. For the remainder of the trip, they can stay with our parents, my BIL's mom, friends, or other family members (who all live nearby) while I go back to work, kids are back in school, & my wife spends the last few days of her break preparing for work or with her family; we offered to meet for dinners or things on the weekend with them.   \n\nShe says it makes more sense to stay with us for 2 weeks to use our house \"as a base of operations\" while they come & go to visit family & friends during the trip as opposed to our offer of spending 9 dedicated days with us & the kids before visiting the others during the remainder of the trip. Despite my telling her that that is a lot for us to handle & gives us stress and anxiety to host & have people staying at our house for that long, she insists that they are \"self-sufficient\" guests & don't need us to do anything. We would still need to plan our kids schedules around when they'll be home so they can see them, keep the house clean, have groceries & toiletries, leave doors unlocked & make sure the garage door or dog doesn't wake the kids up when they come home at 1 am, etc.  \n\nShe said they would have to reschedule & move things around with all the other people they're planning on seeing during this visit so they could spend that time with us. As in, that's an inconvenience to them & they were making plans with everyone but the people they were assuming they could stay with; therefore I should feel bad for putting them in this position.  \n\nTL;DR My sister & BIL assumed they could stay with us for 2 weeks without checking & are now upset that I told them 9 days is what works best for me and my family.

Your sister has no problem telling you what she not only wants but expects.  Do the same.  Don't worry about her being annoyed.

They aren't showing any consideration for your family's schedules at all. They also don't seem to care about the costs to you for extra utilities, groceries, and so on. What about transportation? Is that supposed to fall on you too? \n\nMy family has done visits ranging from a couple weeks to a couple months. Everything was planned ahead of time. Everyone's schedule and needs were planned around so things stayed as close to the usual as possible. There's a right way and wrong way to go about this. What your \"guests\" are demonstrating is the wrong way. It's actually downright rude.", " You need a spine OP.They have shown you they are inconsiderate .They will be bad guests .Tell them their failure to include you while making their plans has caused you to re-think their visit and that it will be best for them to stay elsewhere .\nDo that OR allow them to walk all over you when they come .", "NTA but you should have talked about their plans before they bought tickets.  Sounds like you and they assumed different things and although they are the AH for not clearing it with you first it doesn't honestly sound like you said anything ahead if time to make them think you would not be ok with this.", "NTA and I\u2019d tell them it would be best if the used a different house as their base of operations.", "9 days is a long time! They are mooches to begin with and plain greedy for wanting to stay 2 weeks. If they can\u2019t afford a trip, then don\u2019t go. What\u2019s wrong with people. Please stand up for yourself!", "NTA - tell her what you said here. \"Sis, it seems to me that you were making plans with everyone but the people you thought you were staying with. Those plans don't work for us. This is when you can stay here, or not at all and you need to stay with other people. Let us know what you decide.\"", "NTA. Sounds like they just want free Air BNB.", "Definitely NTA. I say this as someone who almost did a similar thing, reaching out a month in advance and then only following up with one week's notice (except my awful plan was only for 2 days, not 14). By that time, the \"sure we'll be here\" turned into \"um, we have other stuff going on.\" \n\nOnce I realized how stressful it would be for both myself AND the family I'd be visited, I canceled my plan to see them. The timing was based on my being on their side of the country for another event, but it really didn't work out for us. So I'll use that airline's travel bank for my cancelation when it's convenient for all of us and not a rushed stressful trip.\n\nYou offered them 9 days. It's not a negotiation. They don't have to spend the entirety of the 9 days with you, but they do need to work out something else for those additional 5 days they want.", "NTA. I know that me and my family are always welcomed at my mom's and brother's homes but I'd never just plan a 2 week stay without discussing it first.", "NTA\n\nOP, you need to meet sister and BIL's audacity and inconsiderateness with a bit of plain talk.\n\nTell your sister: \"*Making things most convenient for you is not what determines your stay with us. Whatever rescheduling you have to do, is up to you. You didn't bother to ask what was convenient for us or coordinate with us at all. We are happy to host you these 9 days. That is what we are giving you to work with. You can figure out what you need to rearrange and where to stay for the other days, and you don't need to involve us in those plans since they do not concern us.*\n\n*For future visits, please ASK us when is good for us and what we can accommodate before you plan with others. We will be happy to let you know so that you can make your plans accordingly.*\"", "   Base of operations? Self-sufficient? Sounds so military! Now give them a tent they can pitch somewhere else...", "NTA They are using you like a hotel. Seems like they planned on spending very little time with you. They\u2019ve already made plans with the people they want to see. You they\u2019ve kept in the dark.", "NTA are they coming to visit you or are you a free hotel??", "NTA, We went up to see my brother for two weeks.  We found a nice AirBnB that didn't gouge us.  We spent loads of time *together* but retreated back to the rental so we could have some of out normal routine.", "Next time she says it\u2019s inconvenient tell her you are so glad she agreed and ask where she is staying the 2 weeks instead?", "Next time she says it\u2019s inconvenient tell her you are so glad she agreed and ask where she is staying the 2 weeks instead?", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like you knew from the beginning they planned to stay with you for two weeks. You should\u2019ve told them no then instead of saying \u201cthat sounds nice.\u201d It didn\u2019t sound nice and there was no two week timeframe that would let you enjoy this arrangement. The answer was always no and you should\u2019ve said that. \n\nThey suck for not taking the no. Your home isn\u2019t a base of operation. They need to find somewhere else to stay. You have them what you could handle and if that doesn\u2019t work, they need to make new plans. They should\u2019ve kept you in the loop instead of hoping you\u2019d never say no and they do what they want.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t bother to schedule to begin with, you\u2019re not obligated to meet their schedule.", "NTA. To not consult you about dates, and then to \\*push back\\* when you have said that two full weeks doesn't work for you is very rude. \n\nI can see why, if your original response was 'oh, that would be fun', that they might not have understood that you weren't pleased by the idea of a two-week visit - but they should still have checked about the details and it's very inconsiderate that they were making plans with other people but not with you.\n\n So I'm leaning towards NTA and I think it's OK to say that nine days is all you can manage, but I'd continue to be polite to them about it.", "NTA. If you were single and childless, maybe. And that\u2019s a HUGE maybe. But you have an entire family. Once can\u2019t just assume it\u2019s a go.", "NTA.", "They're **already** being bad guests, and they haven't even arrived yet!\n\nJust tell them, \"if you don't listen to our concerns and requests about this, you can't stay with us at all!\"\n\nNTA OP.", "Just tell them that you've reconsidered and since you're family members have lives too, two weeks is way too much and come to think of it so is 9 days.  Since they didn't bother to check with you beforehand, they can now coordinate with a B&B or hotel or whatever other relatives want to host them. You value your time and privacy over their comfort. So sorry, see you next time, maybe.", "NTA. And this \"base of operations\" bullshit? Are they scaling the Matterhorn? No? Then they can decamp.", "My cousin's ex in laws used to come from out of state to visit the family. There was no room at their son and his second wife's house so they ended up staying at my house, still not sure how that came to be. Normally they came for maybe 5 days, long enough to not be that big a problem. They weren't here most of the time anyway, they were visiting their son. The last time they came, they told us when they got here that they were here for 10 or 11 days. It was the worst experience having them here that long", "Guests are like fish, smell after 3 days.", ">9 days or nein.\n\nThis comment is underrated.", "Exactly, because it\u2019s the truth. Honest and to the point.", "It's always amazing to me the kind of entitlement that being \"family\" seems to bring. Reddit has made me forever glad to be an only child.", "[removed]", "To be fair, I never said it was ok. I should have spoken up sooner, but the closest thing I gave to an approval was saying their vague two week trip home to visit family would be fun.", "PREACH", "Right!?   That phrase got to me.", "Same. She also said she was hurt when I said it sounds like they just want to use our house for a bed and a shower, but continued to say \"we figure it will be easier if we could use your house as our base of operations for the trip.\"", "\"It would be easier for US if you found an AirBnB to use as your base of operations\"\n\nThe only thing I would say is you could have jumped on it right away. \"I hope you're not counting on spending a full two weeks with us, we're not able to accommodate that, but let me have your dates and we will confirm what we are able to do\". Otherwise it seems like they took silence as consent when it first came up.\n\nIn any case, NTA. And the 9 days you offered has just gone down to 5."]}
