Not turning the heat on AT ALL is completely unreasonable. That being said, it is also pretty $#!++\u00a5 to come in from the cold and it be around 75 or 80 in there. It feels hotter than it is when you first go inside. I know, I've accidentally done this to myself after turning the heat up, then leaving before remembering to turn it down first. It sucks. 70 is the most common room temp and is considered most comfortable to humans as a species, so around there or a little lower would be a perfectly reasonable expectation. Just because you want to walk around in your \"underwear and a shirt\" and \"it goes back to normal almost immediately\" doesn't make it acceptable to make him sweat his @$$ off when he gets home. Also, expecting you to live in any temperature below 60 is kind of an AH move too.", "NTA. If you're that uncomfortable with the temperature, you need to address that by either finding a compromise on the heating or to wear more clothes.

OP mentioned their roomie keeps their place at 50.\n\n68 is a pretty standard room temp. We do 64 in the winter to be a little more conservative on power. A room at 50 is uncomfortably cold!

They are wearing a t-shirt.  I tell them throw on a sweater or two.", "OP changed original post from 80 to 70. Cranking up the heath to be able to walk in undies is not standard roomtemp.", "& keep in mind you can always put more layers on but you can only take so many off", "OP changed the original post from 80 to 70.", "That\u2019s probably the best idea. OP says it\u2019s \u201cprobably 70\u201d which if it IS 70 I think that\u2019s perfectly reasonable but it could possibly be getting hotter than that.", "I\u2019m a New Yorker. 70 degrees inside is absolutely underwear and shirt weather for people that live in this climate. AND we know how to dress for the cold, so coming inside to 70+ degrees with full winter gear on can be debilitating. \n\nOP, get a space heater and throw on some layers. Tank top, T-shirt, lightweight long sleeve shirt, hoodie - each layer should be a little looser than the last one so you don\u2019t cut circulation. Get some wool socks, too. It\u2019s time to dress for the city you live in.", "70 degrees is definitely underwear and t-shirt weather. I would be a puddle of sweat if I was wearing jeans in a 70 degree room.", "Then put more clothes on when you're cold?", "Yeah, 80 is unreasonable. 70, not so much. I love the random edits they make when they don't like the way votes are going \ud83d\ude05", "He has no buisnees keeping the window open in winter. You need to talk to your RA", "I don't really care, should I have a different feeling if OP likes an even hotter room? It's their room and they're alone! If they lower the temperature (by opening the window) when their roommate gets back then why does it matter to us what temperature the room is? (also I don't think OP knows what the temperature is, it seems like the heater just has a 'hot' and 'cold' gradient style option but that's irrelevant)", "My husband and I keep our house at 60 and both of us walk around in our underwear, it could very well not be anywhere close to 80. Everyone feels temperature differently", "Yep, I'm in CT and my house is 64 during the day.", "Seriously. Wearing a hoody indoors in super normal. Also some sweat pants too.", "I would straight up murder my roommate before I wore 4 layers of clothes in my own living space. Absolutely not. I live here too.", "I\u2019ve always lived in the upper half of the US. My house is between 60-65, and that\u2019s plenty warm for me to be wandering around in a tshirt and undies.", "I keep the house around 70 in the winter and being from texas that means fully dressed in jeans and long sleeved shirts, sometimes with a sweater or hoodie on too.", "Are you from a consistently cold climate?  I\u2019m fine in jeans at 80, unless I\u2019m doing manual labor or running.  \n\nAnd it would be shorts and tshirt after that.  Underwear lounging around at home at maybe 85.", "My parents keep their house at 75, they call it bikini weather lmao", "70 is leggings and sweatshirt weather for me but I live in FL so", "If you do it right you don\u2019t even notice. I don\u2019t wear that much inside, usually, but it would help any newcomer temper themselves until they get used to the cold, or just keep them warm until they get back to their preferred climate.", "Omg I would die lol I don't wear a hoodie until it's in the 40s. Even if it was cold though, the thought of wearing jeans in my own home gives me the ick. My husband and I call them \"hard pants\".", "No, I live in the northeast US. \n\nI keep my house at 65 in summer and 60 in winter. I can't stand being warm - it makes me nauseous.\n\nWhenever I go somewhere I know is going to be in the 70s, I wear a sundress so I don't want to die. Even if it's the middle of winter, I'd rather be cold for a couple minutes in the car than warm later.", "I move from FL to CT. It took me years to acclimate. Here people complain about the heat if it's over 80 and strip down as much as possible with window ACs blasting.", "It's definitely not cold at all...I say as I sit in Santa Ana with both doors open and the fan on. We haven't touched the heater ever. Haven't even had to shut the window at night yet", "Sure but I'm not doing that I'm going to just turn up the heat and wear 2 layers. 4 layers of clothes is way too much to expect someone else to do to make you comfortable.", "Have you had your heart and thyroid checked?  Hyperthyroidism/graves disease and heart disease and a few other things can show up as oversensitivity to heat.  Ask your doc about heat intolerance.  It\u2019s how two of my relatives found out about thyroid issues.\n\nNortheastern US can get pretty cold much of the year, but also pretty warm June-August - you shouldn\u2019t feel overheated at 70 degrees if you\u2019ve spent years living there through summers.", "Yeah 70 is comfortable. I try to keep my house at 67-68 and it\u2019s generally fine and I programmed the thermostat to go down to 64 at night as we sleep underneath a bug down comforter. NTA.", "Exactly my point\u2014 its *not* cold, but I don\u2019t think 70 for the thermostat is hot either. I keep it there but my heat rarely has to turn on given the outside temp, but I know Chicago is cold right now!", "Yes, I mean it's weird to put my medical stuff here but I have hypothyroidism (I take medication daily) and I'm overweight. Hypothyroidism runs in my family and I was diagnosed when I was 17. \n\nI don't feel overheated in 70 degrees if I'm wearing light clothing - like a t-shirt and shorts or a sundress. But if I was wearing jeans and a hoodie, I would be extremely uncomfortable.\n\nMy point is a lot of people do consider 70 warm enough to wear a t-shirt and underwear in."]}
