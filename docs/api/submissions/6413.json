Not turning the heat on AT ALL is completely unreasonable. That being said, it is also pretty $#!++\u00a5 to come in from the cold and it be around 75 or 80 in there. It feels hotter than it is when you first go inside. I know, I've accidentally done this to myself after turning the heat up, then leaving before remembering to turn it down first. It sucks. 70 is the most common room temp and is considered most comfortable to humans as a species, so around there or a little lower would be a perfectly reasonable expectation. Just because you want to walk around in your \"underwear and a shirt\" and \"it goes back to normal almost immediately\" doesn't make it acceptable to make him sweat his @$$ off when he gets home. Also, expecting you to live in any temperature below 60 is kind of an AH move too.", "NTA. If you're that uncomfortable with the temperature, you need to address that by either finding a compromise on the heating or to wear more clothes.

I'm in milwaukee, about as cold as Chicago. I keep my apartment at 58-62. Even 65 starts to be too much imo", "Either he has no choice so he isn't turning the heat way up when his roommate is gone like he says in his subject line, or he is turning the heat up.  Which is it?", "he's said (repeatedly) that they do not get billed for heating.  They live in a college dorm room.  They do not pay utilities.", "there\u2019s no way it\u2019s actually at 50 degrees. like unless you buy a thermostat to show us what it actually gets down to, it sounds like you\u2019re making up numbers to make him sound unreasonable.\n\nI grew up in the Midwest, and lived in both Southern California and I\u2019m the Northeast- based on my experiences with Californians, I do not trust your ability to gauge the actual temperature in your room in the slightest.", "It might not be your primary concern, but it's still *an* issue.", "I grew up in northern Ontario. My parents keep the thermostat at 74 - day, 68 - night. (Or 23-20 C). I live in Kansas and keep mine more or less the same. \n\nWhat does the outside temp in the city you live have to do with what the inside temp should be?  No one should have to dress for outside when they are inside their home. It should be a comfortable temperature. \n\nThat being said, they need to figure out what the temperature *actually* is instead of guessing. Then they can agree on a min and max for the home (ex: no colder than 60 no hotter than 74) If one is home alone they can choose either extreme, and if they are both home they can put it right in the middle. Either one is free to get a space heater or fan for their personal bedroom. There is no right or wrong on how hot/cold you like your home, but with roommates you *both* need to find compromises.", "It is absolutely not \u201cdebilitating\u201d to come in to a 20ish C house from winter cold. You adjust. I live in Northern Alberta, and survive taking my outdoor gear off in the house all the time.\n\nThe cold is so much worse to get through if you\u2019re never really warm.", "We put our house at 75 at night lol", "He said he is turning the heat up when his roommate leaves. Roommate comes back to a hot room, turns the heat down and opens the window? What are you talking about?", "THANK YOU. That's the rule in my house. If I'm fully dressed (sweatshirt, pants, and socks) and still shivering we turn the heat up and my boyfriend loses a layer. \n\nI can't help it that I run cold, just like he can't help it that he runs hot. I have an electric blanket, but I don't always want to be trapped on the couch or in bed.", "Mine is currently in a T-shirt and shorts while I\u2019m in a hoodie and flannel pajama pants. The house temp is 63. We switch temperature tolerance in water. He can\u2019t stand swimming in water under about 85 and I ocean swim in a bikini down to about 50. Under that I\u2019ll put on neoprene booties. Temperature tolerance is weird.", "I keep it at 58-60 in the winter and when alone, I wear underwear and maybe a tank top because some windows in the common areas face a street and don't have curtains. \ud83d\ude06", "OP also says the thermostat doesn't show the temperature, just says hot and cold. OP's guessing at how cold the room is and pulled 50 out of thin air.", "Northern Indiana .... approximately 90 minutes east of Chicago. 50 degrees is too cold! I have mine set at 68. I think 70 is a reasonable temp but sure as hell not 50.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s even possible on most thermostats, which suggests to me that OP is pulling numbers out of his butt.", "In addition to heated blankets as others have mentioned there are also heated mattress pads which are amazing. 50 is definitely too cold and you both as tenants may be responsible for keeping the unit above a certain temperature to prevent frozen pipes. NTA", "My house is 68 and I live in t-shirt and shorts pjs, hubby is in t-shirt and shorts or boxers.", "Yes, this.  op has no idea what the actual temperature is, which is pretty common in most dorms.  Heat is either on or off, I don\u2019t think OP is an entirely reliable narrator.", "No way it's 50\u00b0f the pipes would freeze!", "My dorm HVAC would go down to 55 so it's not entirely out of the realm of possibilities and I kept it as an icebox but I lived somewhere where all my food would spoil if I didn't.", "I'm very used to cold cities, I'm a native New Yorker. And everyone I've ever known wears t shirts and other casual clothes indoors during the winter. No one is wearing 4 layers of clothes, +/- a blanket, indoors, rather than turning the heat up. \n\nAlso, 70 isn't hot imho, that's like hoodie + blanket temp indoors. Being from NYC doesn't give you automatic temperature knowledge, cuz then one of us would be wrong. People have different internal thermostats!", "He\u2019s INSIDE!  This has nothing to do with the outside temperature. His roommate likes it colder inside and he likes it warmer. Where they live has zero to do with anything. \n\nWhen I was in college I also had a roommate who liked it ridiculously cold inside, and I preferred it warm. We were in Saskatchewan, and BOTH grew up in Northern Canada with relatively the same temperatures. I would be turning up the furnace while she would be opening the window. Many arguments happened. But neither one of us were right/wrong. And it had NOTHING to do with the city we were in. I now live in a much warmer climate, and still like my home warmer than most. Both in the winter AND in the summer. I don\u2019t ever turn on my AC unless it\u2019s above 80 outside, and never turn it below 75.", "72 can be boiling to me and 70 is sometimes too cold lmao apparently 71 is my perfect indoor temp", "There is truly no way to get an objective or unbiased assessment on this if you\u2019re just making up numbers like this! Buy a room thermostat for like $10 on Amazon and you\u2019ll see what you\u2019re actually experiencing."]}
