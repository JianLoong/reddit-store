It was devastating to us.\n\nShe's been staying with mom since. She has no family other than me and mom. SIL was NC with her parents. \n\nToday when I was over there, my mom asked when I was taking Angie with me. I was taken aback. \n\nI just graduated and started working. I am very ambitious and that means I have to work very hard to get where I want to get. Not to mention I never wanted to have children. \n\nI told her I wasn't taking Angie. \n\nShe said I have to since I am her aunt. She was retired and doesn't want to work anymore. \n\nI told her I will give her money. And we can put my brother's estate and their life insurance in a trust fund for Angie's education and college. \n\nShe said she didn't want to run around another  kid and she was too old to raise one. I said I am too young and definitely in way lesser position than her, having to work 12 hour shifts and not own a house. She atleast has her own home, with room in a good school district. \n\nShe said I should move back home to take care of Angie then. \n\nI just couldn't quit my dream job after working so hard. So I just left saying I can't. \n\nNow my mom and extended family is blasting my phone's calling me a selfish AH for not taking in Angie. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1693681008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168alzr/aita_for_not_taking_in_my_niece/", "score": 439, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is them caring for Angie definitely not an option?", "Did the parents have some sort of plan for whom would assume custody in case something happened to them?", "NTA, tell your extended family that it's wonderful they're so eager to get her in a home, perhaps theirs would be better!", "Look, my oldest daughter's husband threw her and their 3 little children out of the house in the middle of the night so he could move in their babysitter (his mistress).  At that time, DH and I had been empty nesters for over 5 years.  She had absolutely nowhere else to go - their friends were his drinking and drug buddies, so she couldn't turn to them.  Every time she would get a job and start making friends, he would suddenly disappear and not come home to take care of his kids.  So she had to quit.  There was no one else and nowhere else to go (just like OP's niece).\n\nAs a grandparent, you do what you gotta do. DH was steps away from retiring.  I was having health issues.  Retirement got postponed, and we became very involved grandparents, helping to raise her kids.  They are not my son or other daughter's responsibility (although they are a tremendous help when we need it) and I can not imagine picking up the phone and asking my younger kids when they are going to house her and raise her kids   that is absofuckinglutingly ridiculous!\n\nSomeone should knock granny upside the head and tell her it's time to pull it out of her ass!  She is the full adult in this scenario, and it's her job to step up if she doesn't want the kid to go to state care.  Same for the \"extended\" family.\n\nThe next time the flying monkeys reach out, tell them your mother will be so excited to learn they are taking Angie off her hands!

My parents took in my oldest sister's kids when she abandoned them, and it contributed to the breakdown of their marriage. Stick to your guns and don't let anyone bully you into doing it.

Your mum should never have assumed that you would be taking her in and you're obviously in no position to do that anyway.  But it's still too early for all this to all be decided.  It's going to take the whole family to get together and make a plan to help out with time, money or some other kind of support, and if that's not possible then adoption might be a better option for her eventually.", "Ask extended family to step up, eat their own words.", "NTA.  Don't do it as a frustrated resentful unmaternal (busy or financially struggling if you pull back on your career) aunt would make the worst parent. Your proposal is a good one.

I hope she never finds this Reddit. \n\nIf it's anyone's responsibility it's your mum's as she had kids that lead to a grandkid. Theyre all AHs for assuming  and pressuring you will step in. Would they do the same if you were a son ?", "NTA. Sad situation it is, what provision did the parents make should this happen? You can\u2019t be expected to put your life on hold for a 5 year old.  Tell the extended family 1 of them can take her then if they think it\u2019s that easy then block them all.", "NTA You are not selfish and you are not wrong. You are only 24, will be working long hours and your niece will be in daycare or with a babysitter all day. That does not make you the ideal person to raise her. Plus, she\u2019s 5, not two and your mother will not be running around after her so that is not an excuse. And 60 is not old.\n\nIf your brother left an estate, your mother can afford to pay to have someone come in a few hours to help get her ready for school and maybe take her to play groups. But most grandmothers who lost their son would love having their child as a reminder of their lost child. \n\nHowever, your mother is selfish and if all the relatives who are calling you names won\u2019t help, your niece might be better off finding a family to adopt her. Talk to a social worker and see what help is available. But also contact her mother\u2019s relatives. They have now lost two daughters, and if they realize they will also lose their granddaughter, they might surprise you. And hopefully your mother will never have to see her again.\n\nEdit- As I said, talk to a social worker and they are required to contact her mother\u2019s family members for custody and you won\u2019t have to do it yourself. There is really no reason you have to make arrangements. A social worker should understand that you working long hours makes you not the right person to raise her. But your niece needs to get grief counseling asap.", "So her not wanting to work anymore isn't selfish but you wanting to work is? Make that make sense!

The other alternative for the poor child is foster care. It\u2018s such a sad state of affairs these days when everyone just wants everyone to be selfish with their life.

My spouse and I don't have kids, we aren't planning on having kids and we are pretty old to start at this point.

In fact, I could argue that she is in a better position than most people who have kids.\n\nEdit to add: I never said she was an AH for not taking her neice in. I'm saying she is one for just assuming that her mother would do it. How is this any different than what her mom did? Also, 60 is old. Her mom will be 70 before the neice starts driving. In her 70's dealing with dating and hormones and sneaking around. 60 year Olds are tired. This is a terrible solution for the mom and the neice.", "It was likely done at the time of her birth and not thought about afterwards.

As her grandmother she's her responsibility.", "I agree mom is the best option. She can use some of the estate money to hire a nanny to help.", "So you are fine with forcing the grandmother, just not the aunt? Or should they just turn the neice out?

No, she shouldn't be forced, but if she doesn't, she is an asshole.", "Right. She can choose those things over her neice. It doesn't make her less of an ah for turning out a family member with literally nothing.\n\nAccording to statistica.com, less than 6% of children are born to parent that holds a bachelor's degree, and people who own bachelor's degrees, on average, earn 84% more than high school graduates. In my state, over 50% of children born are born on medicaid. Which means that their parents are in some level of poverty. I would keep researching, but it is all depressing me. I would say this girl in a way better position than that.", "And this hiring a nanny wouldn't work for OP?", "None of this is okay, and this is horrible for everyone. No one asks to be born, part of a family, etc. This sucks so, so much, but that niece needs to go to someone who both has the time and desire to raise a kid.\n\nGo apply to be a foster parent and take your sanctimonious attitude with you.", "You're continuing to be the voice of something, that's for sure.", "She is not her child. How are these statistics even relevant to this question, let alone from the perspective of the OP?\n\nI get what you are saying and thank you for the data, it could be an interesting topic, but we are talking about entirely different matters.", "there is a difference between hiring part time help, and full time help.", "That could work as well. The child needs 1 or both of these relatives to step up.", "The grandmother has also said she does not want her.\n\nI dont need to. I've done this twice already. I took my nephews in when my sister in law got cancer until she beat it. And I have my other niece and nephew rn because my brother is deployed and his ex wife is going through a messy divorce. My aunt took in some of my cousins when my uncle died, and my parents took in 2 of my cousins whenever my other uncle died. 1 of whom had a disability and the other my brother had to take in at 22 when our father passed. I am not saying all of this to be praised or act like I am on some kind of high horse cause im not. Im honestly kind of a shit person. I'm saying this because I have repeatedly witnessed first hand the devastation that kids go through when they are separated from their parents. All of you seem so focused on this woman's life and none of you seem to give a damn about what this girl is going through. You act like selfishness is a right that should be praised when it's not. This is what this forum was built for. She's not wrong that she does not have to take her in. She's just an ah.", "How many of those who took relations in were just starting out in life?
