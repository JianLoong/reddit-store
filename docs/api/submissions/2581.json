{"id": 2581, "submission_id": "yy2tbv", "title": "AITA for not letting my son go to Korean barbecue with family because of the way he treats his younger brother?", "selftext": "I'm a mother of two sons, one is 9 and another is 15. They fight like cats and dogs and it makes me so stressed and tired. I literally have hair falling out over it. My older son always claims the younger one starts it, but the older one keeps it going. If only he would learn to BE THE OLDER ONE AND IGNORE THE YOUNGER ONE and realize that the 9 year old is just trying to get a rise out of him, and he'll stop when the older one doesn't give him that reaction. But my 15 year old doesn't want to realize this, so every time he reacts, he gets punished for it. I've had to take away his hard-earned phone and computer countless times because getting him where it hurts is the only way he'll learn. And he makes it so hard to punish my younger son when the older one does it himself and makes himself the one in the wrong, invalidating any punishment for the younger one.\n\nThe reason why we punish the older one is because due to him being on the spectrum, we\u2019ve had to consult many books and professionals who agree that it is something we need to help him overcome as much as possible so that he can be as successful as he can in the world and not let it ruin things for him, so when he misbehaves we emulate those consequences at home in order to prepare him. Plus, I really can\u2019t punish my younger son; he\u2019s my adopted nephew who was born several weeks early due to his mom having substance abuse issues, and he has a severe learning disability which he can\u2019t outgrow, so I have to be soft on him, and my older son needs to do that as well.\n \nYesterday I had family over in the car coming back from a day trip and we were going to go to Korean barbecue as a family. My 9 year old tried teasing my 15 year old about \"the weird anime stuff he watches\" (I didn't know this) and the older one proceeded to flip out and call my 9 year old names and wish death on him. I just decided I had it, I'm dropping off my 15 year old off and he will not go to Korean BBQ with family, he can have whatever leftovers at home.\n\nHe then began to cry and refused to get out of the car when we got home, but I said I wouldn't drive away until he left. I then had to threaten to take away his computer and phone for a month if he didn't comply and he begrudgingly got out of the car.\n\nI was then subject to a 20 minute long rant about how my 15 year old son hates me and wishes I were dead because I \"favor his brother and make him miserable\" (NOT true, I love them equally) and that I need to learn to \"control my crotch goblin\" (I was shocked when he said this\" and a bunch of other rhetoric, and ended it with him saying that if we don't change our ways, he would disown us when he gets older.\n\nHe's refused to talk to me since then and has told relatives about what happened, with some taking my side and others taking his. I tried sitting down with my son telling him about how much I love him but he told me to F off and \"get on birth control\" and I'm just crushed. What did I do to deserve this?\n\nEdit: Ok I am getting a lot of comments hurling insults and verbal abuse toward me and I can\u2019t respond to them all in one go, but needless to say I don\u2019t appreciate it in the slightest. I have things to do and need to take a breather because everyone is saying I\u2019m the asshole so I\u2019ll be back later.", "created_utc": 1668722131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy2tbv/aita_for_not_letting_my_son_go_to_korean_barbecue/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Step in promptly when younger son instigates\n2. Get your older son the therapy to teach him coping methods, don't punish.  \n3. Stop trying to manage this situation by pressuring the older son to \"ignore\" the younger son's instigation.

Heck, arguably you rewarded him with being the only one to get BBQ.  And if you didn't know the younger kid started it, that's crap parenting.  You should absolutely be getting the whole story before dishing out punishments.\n\nYou've taught your younger son that he can do whatever he wants so long as he gets enough of a rise out of the other person to distract from his role in the situation.  You're raising a bully, and this bully is targeting a neuro atypical person because he's learned his brother is an easy mark.  Your younger son is behaving in a cruel manner towards his brother, and you need to shut this down ASAP or you are going to have a monster on your hands. \n\nYour older son needs to learn to *control himself*.  He DOES NOT need to learn to ignore his brother.  You're saying that because this gives you an out to ignore the younger child's behavior.  Your older son needs to be able to control himself so he can go to you, and feel assured that YOU will deal with the younger child's behavior.  The younger child needs to stop his antagonizing, and you need to be consistent about giving BOTH children consequences for their behavior.

Both kids are neurodivergent it seems yet you only punish the older one? No wonder he is lashing out at the younger because you are enabling the younger one into misbehaving.

You *are* favouring your younger son, and with no good reason. Just because he has a learning disability doesn't mean he gets free rein to do what likes to your older son.

You say about how the arguing affects you, but *you* are making your older son's life a misery by never taking his side. *You* are the one who has the control here as the adult, not your eldest son.

Your 9 year old is the cause of all this so punish him.", "YTA\n\nThis post made my blood boil because how you're treating your oldest is how I was treated growing up. You're wrong and you're not even going to realize how wrong you are until your oldest is an adult and barely has any contact with you.

They fight like cats and dogs and it makes me so stressed and tired. I literally have hair falling out over it. My older son always claims the younger one starts it, but the older one keeps it going. If only he would learn to BE THE OLDER ONE AND IGNORE THE YOUNGER ONE and realize that the 9 year old is just trying to get a rise out of him, and he'll stop when the older one doesn't give him that reaction. But my 15 year old doesn't want to realize this, so every time he reacts, he gets punished for it. I've had to take away his hard-earned phone and computer countless times because getting him where it hurts is the only way he'll learn. And he makes it so hard to punish my younger son when the older one does it himself and makes himself the one in the wrong, invalidating any punishment for the younger one.\n\nThe reason why we punish the older one is because due to him being on the spectrum, we\u2019ve had to consult many books and professionals who agree that it is something we need to help him overcome as much as possible so that he can be as successful as he can in the world and not let it ruin things for him, so when he misbehaves we emulate those consequences at home in order to prepare him. Plus, I really can\u2019t punish my younger son; he\u2019s my adopted nephew who was born several weeks early due to his mom having substance abuse issues, and he has a severe learning disability which he can\u2019t outgrow, so I have to be soft on him, and my older son needs to do that as well.\n \nYesterday I had family over in the car coming back from a day trip and we were going to go to Korean barbecue as a family. My 9 year old tried teasing my 15 year old about \"the weird anime stuff he watches\" (I didn't know this) and the older one proceeded to flip out and call my 9 year old names and wish death on him. I just decided I had it, I'm dropping off my 15 year old off and he will not go to Korean BBQ with family, he can have whatever leftovers at home.\n\nHe then began to cry and refused to get out of the car when we got home, but I said I wouldn't drive away until he left. I then had to threaten to take away his computer and phone for a month if he didn't comply and he begrudgingly got out of the car.\n\nI was then subject to a 20 minute long rant about how my 15 year old son hates me and wishes I were dead because I \"favor his brother and make him miserable\" (NOT true, I love them equally) and that I need to learn to \"control my crotch goblin\" (I was shocked when he said this\" and a bunch of other rhetoric, and ended it with him saying that if we don't change our ways, he would disown us when he gets older.\n\nHe's refused to talk to me since then and has told relatives about what happened, with some taking my side and others taking his. I tried sitting down with my son telling him about how much I love him but he told me to F off and \"get on birth control\" and I'm just crushed.
