{"id": 11718, "submission_id": "11l70b5", "title": "AITA for letting my sister walk me down the aisle despite my fiance and his family's objections?", "selftext": "I (23F) was raised by my older half sister (32F). I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.\n\nA few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected.\n\nMy future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives.\n\nI told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day.\n\nI definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?\n\n**EDIT**    \nI did not expect this to blow up like this and haven't been able to read through all of your verdicts and comments yet, but I wanted to clarify on some of the inquiries which I've seen repeated so far.  \n**Are the in-laws contributing to the wedding?**  \nYes. In fact, they're paying for about 75% of it since I'm in still in school and don't have the money to put towards a wedding the scale that fiance wanted. \n\n**Does your fiance have sisters?**  \nNo; he has two younger brothers.\n\n**Did he ask your sister for your hand?**  \nHe did, actually. She also helped him custom design the engagement ring. She showed me their group text and at one point they spent three weeks trying to decide between five different diamonds. \"Maybe I should just propose with an infinity gauntlet\".  It was very sweet and cute. \n\n**What about when you have children/Have you talked about children?**  \nBecause of a medical condition, I am infertile, though neither of us feel a particular strong urge to be parents anyway. But we also know we're still young and that may change, but even if it does it would be very far in the future. I know all to well that things happen, people leave or fall down or die and so even if we got to the point of wanting to adopt it would have to be when I'm financial stable enough that even alone I'd be able to support and care for a child without it being major blow to my or the child's quality of life. \n\n**Could you walk down the aisle by yourself?**  \nThat was my sister's suggestions when she said she was fine just being the MOH, but I rejected it. Because of her, I never walked alone on the worst days of my life so I'm definately not going to walk alone on the happiest. \n\n**Your sister is amazing!**  \nShe is, as far as I'm concerned, the definition of strength and love and I am collecting all of the kind kind things you all have said to show her because she doesn't realize how amazing she is and it's a gd crime. \n\n**Please update us**  \nI absolutely will. You've all given me a lot to think about, including underlying motivations and larger implications. I'm going to be taking a few days to sit with that and with myself and my feelings, but I promise to make an update about how I've decided to move forward.

He wants to take away something meaningful to you because he wants things to appear his way - that's entirely self-serving. You're not putting your sister before him, you're putting her on your side, right where you want her.\n\nThis is weird controlling behavior on your fianc\u00e9's part, and it gives a very bad vibe about him and his family.

The tradition must be honored and anything else is a direct threat and must be silenced in any way possible.  There is no room for alterations.

They'll hold certain promised things over your head in order to manipulate.\n\nYes, it is his wedding too, and he should get a say in it.  But it is also yours, and the people directly doing things for you, falls under your jurisdiction.  Just as his wedding party is his.

The traditional (historic) meaning was that of a father giving his daughter to her new husband.

If you cave on something this important to you there will be future cave-ins because tradition", "NTA\n\nI want to be very clear. The bride usually chooses who walks her down the aisle. If she has two fathers she chooses. If she has two brothers she chooses. \n\nWhy would they get to dictate who walks you down the aisle? If they really are traditional, in what world does it make sense for his dad to give you away? The dad that didn't raise you and has only known you in recent years. \n\n It is right AND traditional that the person who has been a male role model in your life give you away if that is what you want. \n\nI honestly don't understand why they would be against this. Why is what they want more important than what you want on something so personal to you?\n\nI'd recommend having a discussion with your fiancee and explain how much it means to you, how the person \"giving you away\" should be the person who you feel has earned that right.\nAnd that it is not traditional for the future father in law to give away the future daughter in law. \n\nIf he fights you on this I'd suspect something else is going on that is going to cause some major problems in your relationship in the future.", "Tell your MIL that your FIL can walk your fianc\u00e9 down the aisle if he wants to give someone away.

It doesn't even make sense to have your future FIL walk you down the aisle since you're joining his family.   \n\n\nBut you do need to have a bigger discussion with your fiance about this since he has such a hitch in his getalong about the whole thing.", "NTA. Yes it is your fianc\u00e9s wedding too, but the person walking down the aisle is the one to choose who is walking them. If it would mean a lot to you to have your sister give you away, then she should be the one to do that and your fianc\u00e9 should be supportive and understand that connection. \n\nAlso, traditionally speaking it makes literally no sense for your father-in-law-to-be walk you down the aisle. He can\u2019t metaphorically give you away given that\u2019s he\u2019s the grooms dad and not yours. Traditionally the role is performed by the father of the bride because of past family roles but it\u2019s core is someone who raised the bride and was a guardian to her.

I told her if it was that important to her, I'd decorate a skateboard, put my dad's ashes on it (in a container, not sprinkled on it) and rig it so that it could be pulled so as to accompany me down the aisle.

And thanks for giving me the idea of having my sister walk me when that day comes, lol.  I always thought I would walk solo since my dad passed and my brother is an arse.\n\nThink about this long and hard.  Is he this stubborn on other subjects?  Will your in-laws always play a role in decisions when your husband doesn't get his way?", "NTA I agree that it\u2019s typically a male relative. But I have never heard of the FIL standing in unless you have known him forever and he has played a major role in your life. Most of time, when there isn\u2019t a male relative that has played a major fundamental role in the bride\u2019s life she walks the aisle by herself. You see your sister as fulfilling every role in your family, so it makes sense you want her to do this in your wedding. Weddings are full of traditions but they are also full of things sentimental to both the bride and groom. Hopefully you can start your marriage on a happy note by having a conversation between just the two of you and leave the in-laws out of the compromise process.", "NTA. The fact this is even an issue for your fianc\u00e9 is problematic.", "NTA. I\u2019m a very traditional person, too, but this not just his day.  He can have his things the way he wants and you should have the same freedom.  Having your sister walk you is a testimony to your love and appreciation for how much she loved you. It\u2019s beautiful and you shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice that because your future in-laws are narrow-minded.  Also, your fianc\u00e9 crying to mommy smacks of immaturity.  Be sure you iron that shit out before your wedding.", "NTA - but I think you need to keep in mind that this is a much bigger conversation about values than just who is going to walk you down the aisle. The in-laws insisting that you should care more about what your fiance thinks than what you want on your day is indicative of how your fiance was raised. So is the fact that he objects to your sister walking down the aisle with you at all. If your values significantly differ from these (and I wouldn't blame you if they did, because this is a ridiculous argument on their part), it will continue to cause a problem in the marriage.", "NTA but you\u2019d be TA if you didn\u2019t at least rethink about being with someone like this", "NTA at all. This is the easiest NTA I've ever had. So it won't be a purely traditional wedding. You don't come from a traditional family. Your future MiL can kindly go fuck herself. It's not her son's day. It's both the bride and groom's day. You deserve to be walked down the aisle by the person of your choosing. Your fiance and his family can say they understand how important your sister is to you all they want. Their objections to her walking you down the aisle say otherwise. They all need to get over their themselves.", "NTA. What culture are you living in? I understand that you want to have a good relationship with your in-laws, but what the fuck. Doing things because of tradition just means \"because we've always done it that way\"\nIf your sister is cool with it, maybe you can just go with it, but I have to wonder what future \"traditions\" your in-laws have in store for you, and whose side your partner will be on.", "NTA ... Only the bride can make that decision. I love that your sister stepped up and it's wonderful that you asked her. If you feel it's too stressful, walk down by yourself. However, make sure this marriage is what you want. They're already trying to control what you do.", "NTA honestly, him running to his family and them coming after you on his behalf makes me a little hesitant about your current communication and conflict resolution within your relationship. You clearly have an imbalance of family support. I\u2019m worried you are going to be completely crushed under their collective weight. Are you always going to have to give in because they get a vote and outnumber you?", "NTA\n\nMarriage questions are often sticky because it's a set of major joint decisions for the couple. It can be tough to figure out what part belongs to each person. That being said, it's traditionally the bride's call on the bridal party and roles, so in this case they are over reaching even by tradition. It raises a LOT of questions about how your fiance and his family see gender roles, and if that's compatible with your views. So far it sounds like they are very rigid with such beliefs, so I would not expect them to compromise in the future, which is a bad place to be if you ever disagree. If they pick this hill to die on,  you need to ask yourself if you really want to tie yourself to such attitudes for life.

I never met my dad and our mom OD'd when I was 10 and my sister was 19. My sister's dad was still in her life and was willing to support her, but not me. My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.\n\nA few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected. \n\nMy future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives. \n\nI told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day. \n\nI definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Please think through. \n\nOh - and I wish there was a way I could hug your sister - she sounds wonderful. Please give her one for me?", "Yeah wow. My husband is a teacher and deliberately picks things like pink phone cases because his students will question it and he gets to teach them about gender stereotypes. \n\nMy dad wore beautiful pale pink and gray striped ties in the '80s and I always thought he looked very dapper.\n\nFrankly, a man who won't wear pink or have pink things comes across as weaker to me than one who does.", "Not to mention how comfortable his mom is with just calling her up and telling her what to do. Says a lot about how she will act in the future.", "Yup. Be specific. What if you have a kid who turns out to be gay or trans? What if you have a kid who wants to change to another religion, or leave religion, as a teen? Marrying into a traditional family is a choice that deeply affects your future children.\n\nHe has hangups about wearing pink. Is he going to be one of those dads who goes apeshit if his 2 year old son plays with a \"girl toy\" or likes the wrong color balloon?", "I am so sorry to hear that happened to you and I am so glad you got out. Wishing you the best \ud83d\udc95", "the MIL saying it\u2019s \u201c**his day**\u201d in reference to her fianc\u00e9 is nuts. it\u2019s THEIR day and each person should be able to pick who they want to walk them down the aisle. the fact the fianc\u00e9 apparently thinks the same is a HUGE red flag. it\u2019s one thing to marry into a family with shitty in-laws. It\u2019s another if your future spouse takes the side on crazy shit like this. At 23 years old\u2026 OP has all the time in the world to find someone that will support them", "In my culture that actually is how it works! My husband walked down the aisle with both of his parents, and then I did the same. OP\u2019s father-in-law can fuck off, though.", "My son got married last year. His wife's family is very complicated. Her father backed out of the wedding, which didn't surprise anyone, unfortunately. He has a lot of personal problems. His bride asked her mother to walk her down the aisle, but her mother was nervous about it for her own reasons.\n\nThe solution: each family walked their offspring down the aisle: my wife and I both walked our son down, the bride's mother walked her down. Her mother was still nervous about walking her daughter down the aisle by herself, but doing it this way gave her the support she needed to do it. It was beautiful! \n\nIt was a theme wedding, and the theme was: no stress. If any proposed part of the wedding caused stress to the bride, groom or immediate family, we tossed it out and found something else to do that didn't cause stress. I know I'm biased because it was my son's wedding, but because we tossed tradition out the window in favor of what people actually wanted to do, it was the most meaningful wedding I've ever attended.\n\nEdit: we all agreed that the antiquated idea of \"giving the bride away\" was BS, but we did want to do something to symbolize each of them going from their family of origin to their new family together.", "This is something that needs to be called out more in comments. Their entire problem, and reason for forcing this, is that OP won't play the role of property that they want. She must be \"given away\" by a man, so her new husband can accept ownership of her. They can try and BS and romanticise it as much as they want, but that's the reality. They want to deny OP having the most important support figure of her life, the person who helped her become the smart independent person she is today, so she can be a prop for their \"traditional\" BS.\n\nI'd straight out crush this, call out that nonsense (\"symbolism\") as the BS it is, and tell this guy that such views will have no place in my life, if I was OP.", "big sis sounds so amazing!  she def deserves the honor!  that your fiance and his family don't seem to understand that, and value \"this is how it's usually done\" over something truly meaningful and symbolic is worrying.  I second the suggestion that you and fiance need to have a really serious discussion about how he will handle stuff in the future, when you have a residency to do, working, child raising duties, etc.  He may be too influenced by his traditional parents and that may really interfere with your marriage. And fellows who refuse to wear pink because they think it's a girly color are (1) historically incorrect and (2) insecure in their masculinity over completely superficial and meaningless stuff.  Not a good sign.", "Agree with this. Would he let your daughter paint his nails? Buy you tampons? Buy your daughter tampons?", "They are making it 100% clear that they do not value her opinion at all.", "Yeah, but she\u2019s got Reddit so now it\u2019s 3000 to 3 \u270a\ud83c\udffcnow who\u2019s outnumbered? \n\nNot for real, if he runs to his parents for back up against his fianc\u00e9e, he is going to be a nightmare to have kids with.", "\u201cKnot-tying\u201d you\u2019re referring to is known as a hand fasting ceremony. \nYour name is awesome!\n\nETA: NTA, OP.

Run fast. The fact that he and his family is trying to make you minimalize the only person you have is a major red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\nBest check those flags.  Mommy seems a little too involved. That doesn\u2019t get better with time.  Hope you\u2019re ok with her inserting herself every time he doesn\u2019t like or disagrees with you.", "INFO: Why are you marrying such a shallow misogynist??", "Yes!  We did the same thing.  Four years earlier my parents did the same for my brother.  And even though we didn't discuss it until the day of the wedding, my in-laws walked my husband down the aisle.  So perfect.  I really do think you should stick to your guns and honor your sister.  It sets you up as an assertive human in his family, so they can't continue this crazy idea of gender roles.  Not just in his family, but with him.  While this can seem like just one thing, it can balloon into more controlling requests in the future.  Good luck and congrats!", "And if she causes any problems he'll get his mommy to talk to her.", "Yikes! I missed that she was 23. OP you are SO young, don't rush into marriage. Finish your studies, get started in your career, build the life you want, and see if you and your partner are still a good fit when you're working. My fear would be that his \"traditional views\" will extend way beyond how he wants the wedding to look, and he might not support you actually having a career and making the sacrifices necessary to succeed in medicine.", "Exactly! The groom\u2019s family is trying to declare \u201cownership\u201d of the bride before she even officially joins the family.", "Lotta people talking about the misogyny and red flags here, rightly so,  but I'm also stuck on the fiance showing so little care for something that's incredibly meaningful for OP. I dunno.  I wouldn't want my fiance to be a misogynist either, but, more importantly,  I wouldn't want them to so easily dismiss something that meant the world to me.", "NTA at all. My mom passed away and my sister and I were raised by her alone. My dad is the type that if I said I needed new shoes, he\u2019d say \u201cme too\u201d and that\u2019s it. When I get married I fully intend on having my sister walk me down the aisle. This really screams red flag to me as I question what happens if/when you have kids. How will his family treat your sister, will it be a big deal if she comes over every holiday or birthday? Will they expect her to fall back since you\u2019re now married and \u201chave his parents\u201d. I\u2019m so upset by their archaic belief", ">He does have some performative masculinity hangups, like he would never use something that's pink or let me pay for the entirety of a shared meal (either we split or he pays), but nothing aggressive or misogynistic.\n\nSo he wouldn't use a pink plate? Or a pink straw? Or wear a pink shirt? That's some very unmanly shit. Also, what man wouldn't let his girl buy him a meal? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour BF doesn't sound like a man, he sounds like a child to me. Children may seem non-aggressive until they feel they have ownership and then it switches. Watch yourself in this one.", "If he's already running like a baby to his mom bc he didn't get his way, he's gonna do it every.single.time you guys have an argument. Just think about that. They're gonna control you & try to eventually distance you from your sister. His true colors are slipping out early", "Lol, my husband-to-be actually walked me down the aisle, speaking of non-traditional. But I guess he's a man, so that's ok?", "It's the tax females need to pay to be considered a woman, once you become a wife a switch flips in the misogynistic mind and you'll need to submit to their definition of what a wife is and does to be trated with basic decency. The dehumanizing view of the ho and the Madonna to justify abuse towards women who don't beheave as the patriarchy demands.", "Yeah, it's got an icky vibe to it.", "Because, obviously the most important part of that role is that it's done by a man. /s", "Before my husband and I got married, the minister had us go to a marriage counselor for a session. The counselor helped us discuss all sorts of topics that might cause stress later if we weren\u2019t on the same page or were blindsided by the other person\u2019s views. I never would have thought of doing this on my own, but I highly recommend it!", "Seriously,  OP needs to read posts over at r/JustNoMIL to read more about her future. OP, if you choose to have children,  be prepared to have your in laws want to visit as soon as you're out of the hospital even if it's against your wishes and your husband may not have your back. That's just one of many boundary stomping examples you can read about there. \n\nIf you are going to be his wife, then he needs to support you. Your sister did a lovely thing for you in raising you.  So much so that you're in med school now. Until your fiance, she was the most important person in your life and shaped who you are. If your fiance can't support your decision now, then I think you need to reconsider this marriage and have some bigger conversations.", "> Who taught you what it is to love? While I know traditionally it's a passing of property, I see it now as a symbolic lead to the alter: I chose this person to bring me here literally because they brought me here figuratively. They made me someone who is mature and patient enough to find love and get married.\n\nThis is exactly why we did it they way we did! Our parents laid the foundations for who we are and what we sought in a spouse. It felt natural and comfortable for them to help us transition to our new lives. Adding their blessing and support was just a lovely touch.", "I think that convincing her to leave medicine might be a bit of a leap. \n\nBut how he's currently reacting to his family's objection is worrisome.    I'm more concerned that traditional gender roles might be off-kilter as a result of OP's career, and the fianc\u00e9's family will have no problems voicing their disapproval.  Snide comments if OP is working during a kid's recital or birthday or any other holiday, and a whole host of passive-aggressive bullshit when she is there.  And if fiance doesn't shut that shit down immediately, it builds resentment.  Which then causes the kids to feel the resentment and bitterness (why can't Mom be here for all of these things like Grandma says she should be).  \n\nIt's death by 1000 little cuts.", "If they only knew that pink didn\u2019t become a gender signifier until the 1940s and for a long time prior to that, it was actually the opposite with red/pink being considered a masculine color. \nAlso, tradition is only meaningful if it is just that\u2014that the practice has significance to those who are following it. Otherwise, it\u2019s just peer pressure from dead people.", "I agree. If the fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t accept your choice of something as simple, and yet as meaningfully symbolic, as your choice of who walks you down the aisle without a ridiculous amount of pushback and without getting the future in-laws involved in your disagreements, I would be very worried for the rest of the future of this marriage. I would also choose this as a hill to die on. NTA.", "I'm really sorry you went through that nightmare and so glad you're finally free. Many people think is as easy as getting up and leaving through the front door so it is a very difficult action that needs a small start before you take the big steps.
