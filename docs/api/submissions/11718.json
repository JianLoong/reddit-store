My sister chose to be my guardian and her father's family went low-contact with her as a result. In order to raise me she gave up a lot; her relationship with her father, college, her 20s, and so much more.\n\nA few months ago I got engaged and I told my sister that in addition to being my maid of honor, I also wanted her to be the one to walk me down the aisle. All my life she's had to fulfill so many roles for me -- big sister, mother, father, friend -- that it only felt right that those multiple roles be honored on one of the biggest days of my life. My sister was ecstatic and so was I, but when I brought it up with my fiance he objected. \n\nMy future in-laws are very traditional and my fiance had always expected that his wedding would be a very traditional white wedding. He said that it was great that my sister was my MOH, but that her having two roles wasn't and that it wasn't appropriate for her to walk me down the aisle since that's usually done by a man. Apparently, his family had assumed that my future father-in-law would be the one to give me away since I don't have any male relatives. \n\nI told him that I appreciate his father being willing to fill that role, but that the one who make me the person I am is my sister and so it's right that she be the one to give me away. It turned into an argument that's spread to my in-laws. My MIL called me a few days ago to say that although she understand how important my sister is to me, that it's also my fiance's wedding and I shouldn't be putting my sister before him on his day. \n\nI definately heard her on that, but this is still important to me. At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point.

He wants to take away something meaningful to you because he wants things to appear his way - that's entirely self-serving. You're not putting your sister before him, you're putting her on your side, right where you want her.\n\nThis is weird controlling behavior on your fianc\u00e9's part, and it gives a very bad vibe about him and his family. What happens down the road when/if you decide to have children? If you pick out a child's name, does he get to veto that and replace it with a name of his choosing, too?

The tradition must be honored and anything else is a direct threat and must be silenced in any way possible.  There is no room for alterations.

They'll hold certain promised things over your head in order to manipulate.\n\nYes, it is his wedding too, and he should get a say in it.

One where both of you make equal sacrifices in order to make things fair and equitable.", "NTA. Being walked down the aisle is a *very* personal decision. The traditional (historic) meaning was that of a father giving his daughter to her new husband.

It should be something meaningful and personal. It should be an important key-moment for you. And guess what? It will be with your sister walking you dawn the aisle.

If you cave on something this important to you there will be future cave-ins because tradition", "NTA\n\nI want to be very clear. The bride usually chooses who walks her down the aisle. If she has two fathers she chooses. If she has two brothers she chooses. \n\nWhy would they get to dictate who walks you down the aisle? If they really are traditional, in what world does it make sense for his dad to give you away? The dad that didn't raise you and has only known you in recent years. \n\n It is right AND traditional that the person who has been a male role model in your life give you away if that is what you want. \n\nI honestly don't understand why they would be against this. Why is what they want more important than what you want on something so personal to you?\n\nI'd recommend having a discussion with your fiancee and explain how much it means to you, how the person \"giving you away\" should be the person who you feel has earned that right.\nAnd that it is not traditional for the future father in law to give away the future daughter in law. \n\nIf he fights you on this I'd suspect something else is going on that is going to cause some major problems in your relationship in the future.", "Tell your MIL that your FIL can walk your fianc\u00e9 down the aisle if he wants to give someone away. Or better yet, strongly consider not marrying into this family because they\u2019re the assholes.", "Definitely NTA. The person walking with you should be the person you want. In this case your sister is your only parent and it is completely OK for her to have the honor. Your future FIL and MIL are being sexist and are intruding on a call they don't get to make. Unless you want your own family to be bound by your fianc\u00e9's family's tight ass views forever, hold your ground on this one. 90% of the time when I read a bride post on AITA, it is a bridezilla AH. You definitely are not.", "NTA. It doesn't even make sense to have your future FIL walk you down the aisle since you're joining his family.   \n\n\nBut you do need to have a bigger discussion with your fiance about this since he has such a hitch in his getalong about the whole thing.", "NTA. Yes it is your fianc\u00e9s wedding too, but the person walking down the aisle is the one to choose who is walking them. If it would mean a lot to you to have your sister give you away, then she should be the one to do that and your fianc\u00e9 should be supportive and understand that connection. \n\nAlso, traditionally speaking it makes literally no sense for your father-in-law-to-be walk you down the aisle. He can\u2019t metaphorically give you away given that\u2019s he\u2019s the grooms dad and not yours. Traditionally the role is performed by the father of the bride because of past family roles but it\u2019s core is someone who raised the bride and was a guardian to her. They\u2019re more focused on the gender than the meaning and that\u2019s a red flag to think about in terms of future expectations.", "NTA  \n1. What a wonderful way to honor your sister and the roles she has played in your life  \n2. Your partners inability to grasp something so significant to you is disturbing   \n3.

Is he/his family like this about other things?  If they are this pushy about this - think about the future.

Or have they done it before?\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If I may ask, how many other \"traditional values\" are they expecting you to uphold, once married?", "NTA, and frankly, I think you should cool your heels fairly significantly when it comes to this wedding. Why rush into a lifetime connection to an entitled \"traditional\" family when you're 23?", "NTA\n\nBut walk yourself down the aisle. If they have a problem with this, reconsider the marriage.\n\nIf only a man can give you or walk you down the aisle. You will have more issues than this in your future.", "What? But why is it ok for him to put his family before you? Let this mamas boy go", "NTA. I\u2019d be very concerned about how important gender roles are to fianc\u00e9 and his family in other areas.", "NTA\n\nYou realize that this is a test case for how future interactions between you and your new family will go?  What you do here determines how it'll go next time.", "All the NTA, and your fiance and his family are being total **AHs**. Honestly I'd tell him that either your sister is walking you down the aisle or the wedding's off, or if you would prefer something less extreme say that you're open to simply going down to city hall but I absolutely don't think that you should budge on this and that it is ridiculous that they are opposing it.", "NTA - first of all, this is your choice to make.   second, your fianc\u00e9 involving his mother in this discussion is incredibly immature of him.  third, I am not sure why they care - yes, its his wedding too, but this in no way changes that.", "I mean... if we're being traditional, it makes less than no sense for you to be \"given away\" by your future father-in-law.", "NTA.

It was a very special moment for both of us.", "NTA, tell him if your sister walking you down the aisle is that much of a deal fine she won't *because the wedding is postpones until he gets his head out of his ass.*", "NTA - it's okay to want your sister to walk you down the isle. \n\nBut I also think you are both getting married and that involves making decisions together fairly, personally I think it'd be a much nicer gesture to have your fianc\u00e9s father walk you down the isle, and your sister could be ring bearer of hold the trail of your dress. \n\nIt can still be special but with traditional settings.", "NTA. I admire the effort you big sister put in to raise you. Having her walk you down the aisle is a no brainer. Also you made me tear up. Thanks, I'm at work and am the grumpy miserable old bloke.", "NTA - It's an important role and she is the person that made you who you are today, so you are right in choosing her if you want to.\n\nHowever, I would urge you to have a serious discussion with your fianc\u00e9 about his view on gender roles since this will affect your marriage.", "NTA.

I told her if it was that important to her, I'd decorate a skateboard, put my dad's ashes on it (in a container, not sprinkled on it) and rig it so that it could be pulled so as to accompany me down the aisle.    She let it go after that.\n\nDon't let someone else force their \"vision\" of a wedding onto you.

But I have never heard of the FIL standing in unless you have known him forever and he has played a major role in your life. Most of time, when there isn\u2019t a male relative that has played a major fundamental role in the bride\u2019s life she walks the aisle by herself. You see your sister as fulfilling every role in your family, so it makes sense you want her to do this in your wedding. Weddings are full of traditions but they are also full of things sentimental to both the bride and groom.

It\u2019s beautiful and you shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice that because your future in-laws are narrow-minded.  Also, your fianc\u00e9 crying to mommy smacks of immaturity.  Be sure you iron that shit out before your wedding.", "NTA - but I think you need to keep in mind that this is a much bigger conversation about values than just who is going to walk you down the aisle. The in-laws insisting that you should care more about what your fiance thinks than what you want on your day is indicative of how your fiance was raised. So is the fact that he objects to your sister walking down the aisle with you at all. If your values significantly differ from these (and I wouldn't blame you if they did, because this is a ridiculous argument on their part), it will continue to cause a problem in the marriage.", "NTA but you\u2019d be TA if you didn\u2019t at least rethink about being with someone like this", "NTA at all. This is the easiest NTA I've ever had. So it won't be a purely traditional wedding. You don't come from a traditional family. Your future MiL can kindly go fuck herself. It's not her son's day. It's both the bride and groom's day. You deserve to be walked down the isle by the person of your choosing. Your fiance and his family can say they understand how important your sister is to you all they want. They're objections to her walking you down the isle say otherwise. They all need to get over their themselves.", "NTA. What culture are you living in? I understand that you want to have a good relationship with your in-laws, but what the fuck.

Only the bride can make that decision. I love that your sister stepped up and it's wonderful that you asked her. If you feel it's too stressful, walk down by yourself. However, make sure this marriage is what you want. They're already trying to control what you do.", "NTA honestly, him running to his family and them coming after you on his behalf makes me a little hesitant about your current communication and conflict resolution within your relationship. You clearly have an imbalance of family support. I\u2019m worried you are going to be completely crushed under their collective weight. Are you always going to have to give in because they get a vote and outnumber you?", "NTA\n\nMarriage questions are often sticky because it's a set of major joint decisions for the couple. It can be tough to figure out what part belongs to each person. That being said, it's traditionally the bride's call on the bridal party and roles, so in this case they are over reaching even by tradition. It raises a LOT of questions about how your fiance and his family see gender roles, and if that's compatible with your views. So far it sounds like they are very rigid with such beliefs, so I would not expect them to compromise in the future, which is a bad place to be if you ever disagree. If they pick this hill to die on,  you need to ask yourself if you really want to tie yourself to such attitudes for life.

At this point, my sister has even said that she doesn't mind just being the MOH and that she doesn't want to turn my happy day into something stressful. So now it's just me holding out and being stubborn, but I really don't want to concede on this point. Am I being the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Are you sure you want to marry this guy?", "See the irony in this, is that they want traditional values, right? Well the reason the bride is walked down the isle, is because the Father is 'giving away' the daughter to be married. The father is effectively passing the baton of responsibility to the groom. Who held that baton of responsibility throughout your life? Well it was your sister, so it seems fitting to me that she give you away. \n\nSecondly, the MIL says that it's not just your wedding, it's also your fianc\u00e9's, which is true, but the part where you are being given away, that is literally your choice, I don't see how it's a mutual choice at all?

Good men support their wives, non-violently, of course. Its not just his wedding, it's your wedding. TRADITIONALLY, it's the brides wedding entirely. Men pretty much stay out of it. If they want to play the \"traditional\" card, they can back TF down.   \n\n\nI'm so sorry, but this might not be the right long term relationship for you. I know that you love him, but this says so much about him and his values. Does he think that he's buying you as an object who will have no will and no say about your life? Does he think that he gets to define what is right and wrong with no input from you? Does his family support this abusive idea that your input doesn't count?  \n\n\nAs a kiddo who went through as much as you went through, you are vulnerable. Abusive men love that because its easier to isolate you. I don't know if this guy is working this angle, but it sure sounds like his family is.   \n\n\nIt's absolutely outrageous to think that your father in law would walk you down the aisle.  I guess it would be cool if he was involved in your childhood somehow, like being a friend of the family, but NO, FILs do not walk brides down the aisle and \"EW!\" at the idea that this is traditional.
