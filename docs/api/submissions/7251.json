It\u2019s the little things in life that can bring the greatest joy. You don\u2019t need to spend a fortune to put a smile on someone\u2019s face, and we also have kids in this story. Returning it would just mean it goes into the landfill, so that\u2019s an awesome example to set in front of your kids as you take the cake away from them (plus the gas/transportation costs and time it would take\u2026not to mention possibly feeling mortified telling customer service you want to return a $6 cake because your wife said so).\n\nCakes only on birthdays?
