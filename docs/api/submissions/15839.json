She had a miscarriage just 6 months earlier who was going to be named Stella. No one in the family knew, my mother apologized immediately and the name was dropped without a second thought. She didn\u2019t know the history, she didn\u2019t comfort her through 14 years of pain, she simply picked a pretty name, and she dropped the name IMMEDIATELY. I personally believe what your friend did is absolutely horrible and shows that she really doesn\u2019t care about you. \n\nWith that being said, I also believe you should not name your future child that name either. That name already belongs to a child who was loved deeply, even if that baby wasn\u2019t born.

This baby and any baby you have in the future can both be called the same name. \n\nAnd besides the above, she's not even using the version you want - you said she's shortened the name you want.

You're setting the memories and expectations of a baby who passed away onto another child. That child is going to grow up knowing they'll never be good enough because they're constantly compared to a deceased child. Choose another name and allow your child to be their own person.

I don\u2019t know if I would call my rainbow baby that, because this name (in my world) is already given to your other baby.

It's frustrating when someone chooses the same name as you for a baby but there's no \"dibs\" on names regardless of your losses.

YTA if you let this be a reason to end a friendship.", "I\u2019m going to say what some other here already said: don\u2019t name your future baby after the one you lost. \n\nMy older brother had a twin that died, my brother (poor thing, he was 5) pressured my parents to use his lost brother\u2019s name for me, so they came up with a similar name and told him the nurse got the name wrong. I now love my name because it has a story, but I wouldn\u2019t want to carry the name of a lost child and be constant reminder to grievance to my family. \n\nOh btw: ESH. She was insensitive, and, while I get your sadness, it\u2019s her baby. This will change dynamics in your relationship and if she doesn\u2019t understand that I\u2019m sorry but she might have lost a friend.", "NTA, she's only using that name because you always mention how much you want to use it.

Maybe you\u2019re having a hard time seeing her have a baby when that\u2019s what you really want right now and those issues are preventing you from seeing the situation clearly?\n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think a name is a good reason to end the friendship.", "Nothing\u2019s stopping you using the name. Unless it\u2019s a random word you made up, there will be other people in the world who have this name.\n\nIMO though, feel free not to take it, I think it\u2019s distasteful when people name their children after an older sibling who passed. You\u2019re putting all your grief onto the tiny shoulders of a child who deserves their own name.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m surprised by the comments here\u2026\u201dyou don\u2019t own a name\u201d is true, but you all are ignoring that this is OP\u2019s BEST friend. She was well aware of all of the baggage associated with the name, in fact it seems like that baggage (history) is the exact reason she wanted to use the name in the first place! Already that\u2019s a bit tone def imo, but then the way the friend chose to communicate about this with OP was incredibly insensitive. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how some of you can see why it would be a bad idea for OP to name future children after a miscarriage, but find it appropriate for her BEST friend, of all people, to do the same. \n\nI\u2019ve seen almost identical posts on here and everyone was totally understanding of the posters perspective, so idk why you\u2019re all attacking OP this time.", "Sort of baffling to me that everyone like \"you don't own the name\" as if you would care if it was anyone else that called their child that. I don't know where they are coming from.", "I am going to go against the grain and say ESH.\n\nNo one owns a name. I don't agree that you can tell someone \"don't use M name because I plan to use it for my own child.\" Especially because it sounds like you might not be using the name anytime soon.\n\nBut I also think using your friend's baby name, out of all the names in the world, knowing how they feel about it is kinda cruel. I am not sure of the rarity of the name. I have renamed a cat because someone lost a baby with the same name and I wanted them to come around. So \"Josh the Cat\" became \"Fish the Cat.\"\n\nI don't think anyone has the ultimate naming rights to any child. But I do think context matters. I also think the commonality of the name plays a huge part in who is more of an asshole. \n\nI had a cousin name their kid John. Their SIL threw a fit because \"John was my late father.\" But John has been used in every family since ancient times. It is not a new or exciting name. We had like 10 John's in the family right now, alive and well. \n\nBut if my cousin named her baby \"Myung-Hee\" knowing it was the name her friend used for a dead baby... I would be on the friend's side.", "May not be popular, but NTA *under these very particular circumstances.*  \n\nYou don\u2019t get to gatekeep a name, but I would similarly feel very upset and betrayed if someone did this to me while laughing it off like it was no big deal when they know the full history.  I would likewise ask that they please not do so. \n\nThat said, she can name the child whatever she wants.  Just like you don\u2019t have to stay her friend if you don\u2019t want (and I don\u2019t think I could).", "YTA.  she can choose whatever name she likes.\n\nYTA  for naming your rainbow baby  the same name as your first. Nobody wants to named after a deceased  sibling", "ESH you don\u2019t own a name but she knew the significance. She knew that you will be reminded of the child you never got to have every time you see her, it will have an affect on how your relationship is going forward. I think the comments saying Y T A are forgetting the fact that she knew the significance and has a completely uncaring attitude towards how this would affect their friendship. It shows me that she\u2019s doesn\u2019t really care that much.\n\nThe reason you suck is as gently as possible, do NOT under any circumstances name your next child after the child you lost. That is an unfair burden of expectation to place on them. You can\u2019t use them to replace the child you lost like that, they are not them.", "OP - YTA - lightly and I am so very sorry that you are struggling with your loss, the wait for another chance, and your friendship.  I had names picked out for my children but none of them stuck, no matter how attached to them I was.  Why?  Because the name didn't \"fit\" them and how I felt or what happened when I carried them.  Don't get stuck on the name as it will and is shredding you.\n\nIt seems apparent you are still grieving and very frustrated with your current situation. Maybe you should consult a professional before making any decisions about your friendship and get to the root problem.", "YTA.

Now. YTA.", "What is the name?", "ESH. Yeah, no one owns a name, but your friend knew this one was special to you.

Your miscarried baby had her own name. If you ever do have a baby, they deserve their own name.", "ESH\n\nYou because you're trying to gate keep a name and you think you can reject the name of someone else's child, her because she knows how much this name means to you and she could have been nicer about it.", "Every time I see \u201crainbow baby,\u201d I wonder why people are assigning identities so soon, then remember what the term is actually trying to convey. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nESH", "YTA. I would have a different opinion if you recently had a miscarriage shortly after she wanted to use the same baby name but it\u2019s been 14 years. You say she is shortening it so that means it\u2019s a different name anyway", "First of all, I am so sorry for everything you went through with your first child, and I totally understand the hurt that you have about the friend wanting to use that name. However, I do think YTA for one simple reason: your future child if you are lucky enough to have one. That child deserves their own identity and to not considered as second best or the replacement by having the exact same name. \n\nIf this friend has truly supported you, I suggest having a proper sit-down conversation in a few days' time about how you feel. Unfortunately, you don't own the name, and if she decides to name her child, that name that's up to her. You need to decide whether a name is more important than a friendship. Based on what you described in the initial post about her being flippant about, it makes her a slight TA. However, we don't know her take on this..", "YTA because you can still use the name of you want. She doesn't own the name anymore than you do. I would almost understand if you said you couldnt bear to hear the name of the child who didn't survive but you plan to use it yourself so that's not ilthe scenario.", "ESH. I understand the argument of most people saying YTA that you don't own a name and so technically you can't force her to not name her baby something.\n\nHowever, considering she is your best friend, as well as her knowing the history you have had, I think it's very weird of your friend to still want that name. I mean, even if you weren't planning on using that name for your rainbow baby, I feel like it would still be very weird of your friend to use it? Like, it's one name that has so much history and trauma connected to it for you (her best friend!), so why would she even still want to use that name? I don't get it. There are plenty of other good names out there, I'm sure.", "Soft YTA\n\nNames are not owned. Many ppl all over the world have the same name. In the same families. \n\nAll your emotions are about the situation not the name and it's a bit unfair to project all that on her as though she should know and view the name as you do. \n\nShe did not go through the loss of pregnancy with you and even if those 2-3 months were meaningful to you - you can't expect her to fully understand bc she was not in your life then.", "You want to name your (possible) coming child after your dead child? Don't do that. Just don't. Great grandparents or whatever is one thing, this is not that. \n\nLet those that are alive be that on their own accord without the shadows of death surrounding them. Those that are no longer with us, should be loved and cherished in our memories. \n\nHowever, your friend could have been more sensitive. But you don't own a name either. \n\nESH", "ESH.  She could have been more considerate but you are being a bit entitled about a name that you may never use.", "ESH.
