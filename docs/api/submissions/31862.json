I just want to know if I\u2019m a mild, medium or extra spicy one.\n\nYesterday I was at Chipotle for lunch. It was a Sunday so they were short staffed, but also a holiday weekend when a lot of people are still with large family groups. I get it.\n\nWhen I got there I was probably like 4th in line behind an older couple. I was there for a bit when I realized the couple was taking a really long time to order for what seemed like 15-20 people. Confusing ingredients on individual items, repeating a lot, etc. It bothered me a little because this is exactly what mobile ordering/calling ahead is for. So they were causing the line to build up. All the employees were making this order, 3-4 more people got in line while I was waiting.\n\nWhat made me say something was when the place ran out of shredded cheese - that's a problem with management and shouldn\u2019t have happened. But the staff realized it when about half of the order was finished, and had to tell the couple this.\n\nTheir response was to have the crew disassemble all the food and make them redistribute the cheese across the rest. By this time I\u2019d been 4th in line for 15 minutes and like 10 more people had come in. People in line were starting to get upset and complain to the STAFF, which was making me angry. The crew was doing their best and this couple was actively making their job harder.\n\nA great way to piss me off is for entitled people to cause service workers problems. So I said \u201cWhat the hell are you guys doing? Do you see the line of people waiting to order? Why are you doing this to the employees, just take your order and go\u201d The husband said that Chipotle ran out of cheese and the staff needed to fix it.\n\nThis Chipotle is in a plaza directly across from a Trader Joes, so I pointed to it and said \u201cGo get some! Then you can have as much cheese as you want!\u201d The husband said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to\u201d. I said \u201cAre you kidding me? Yeah, it sucks, but you\u2019re making things MUCH WORSE, and you can fix it yourself.\u201d He told me to mind my own business, I said they\u2019re making their problem EVERYONE\u2019S, AND they used up the cheese (it would have run out soon anyway but I wasn\u2019t feeling generous).\n\nI wanted to embarrass them into just leaving. Their entitlement won and they stayed, so I stood with my arms folded and glared at them. At this point I just didn\u2019t want them to feel okay about doing this and to make them think about it in the future. The employees weren\u2019t saying anything to me, and continued as usual once the couple finally left (after like 30 minutes). I did apologize to the cashier for causing a scene and they said not to worry about it.\n\nI ended up getting queso sauce on my burrito instead of shredded cheese, and I think I might like it better.\n\nTL;DR AITA for angrily calling out a couple who were knowingly holding up a huge line and making the staff\u2019s job much harder than it should have been?", "created_utc": 1701107920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18593up/aita_for_causing_a_scene_at_chipotle/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe not even management, sometimes you order things for your store as a manager and the company just doesn't send enough, sometimes they even put a limit on how much you can order \"so nothing gets ever wasted\", because that means losing money.

Chipotle is not a need.\n\nYou also could have just left the scene. You getting angry made more stress overall and contributed negatively to an already negative situation.", "YTA.

They should have refused to do it.\n\nYou didn't help anything. The staff was already stressed and failing to deal with the large order correctly. You didn't need Chipotle.

Which would have been exactly the same amount of food, and really wouldn't have taken a very different amount of time to order and make.\n\nThe logistics of having two people order a whole bunch of burritos in person are a bit awkward, but manageable with competence. (You have two people. Each has a copy of the list. One person orders the burritos, and specifies rice, beans, and protein. Second person stands by the salsas and deals with that.)\n\nUnfortunately, these weren't competent people...", "that\u2019s a fair point. i would also like to understand more about the queso development, and how they landed on that solution for OP but not for the olds.", "actually OP said an \u201corder for what seemed like 15-20 people\u201d so you are already layering on your own take of it being absolutely twenty people.\n\nlol.", "i get you OP and i appreciate that you aren\u2019t taking this as seriously as the other posters i\u2019ve hit a nerve with. no doubt the olds were super worried that whomever they were buying for got what they wanted so they didn\u2019t get yelled at by the grandkids when they got home.", "this is a fun one. you \u201ctreat other people with consideration\u201d by yelling at them?\n\nthe right behavior here, in your estimation, is the OP yelling at the other customers? \n\nyou can\u2019t even get straight who you are identifying with in this story. is the chipotle workers who did not appreciate what OP did or the other customers who did not appreciate what OP did?", "Fair", "When I got to the head of the line, I knew they were out of cheese so decided myself to sub it for queso. I don't remember if they offered it as an option to the couple tbh", "> \u201corder for what seemed like 15-20 people\u201d\n\n\"I'm going to focus on a single part of this post that I disagree with and ignore the fact that even 15 people is too many, and that  they staff should not have deconstructed, and so on\"\n\nLife is simple when you bury your head in the  sand, huh?", "That's true, and honestly something I hadn't thought about.", "Kick rocks dummy. The right behavior is: not being a fucking pest and holding up what should be a quick process. OP got tired of waiting and said something AFTER they decided to prolong the situation MORE by DEMANDING the cheese be redistributed. How is this hard to grasp? You can\u2019t keep two thoughts going at once? \n\nI identify with the workers and OP. make sense now, or are you just going to keep being the most obtuse redditor?", "\u201ci\u2019m going to make a super big point based on something that the AH OP clearly exaggerated anyway because they were annoyed and want people to side with them.\u201d \n\ni can do it too! \n\nlife is simple when you\u2019re angry and ignorant, huh?"]}
