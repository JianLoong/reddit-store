I just want to know if I\u2019m a mild, medium or extra spicy one.\n\nYesterday I was at Chipotle for lunch. It was a Sunday so they were short staffed, but also a holiday weekend when a lot of people are still with large family groups. I get it.\n\nWhen I got there I was probably like 4th in line behind an older couple. I was there for a bit when I realized the couple was taking a really long time to order for what seemed like 15-20 people. Confusing ingredients on individual items, repeating a lot, etc. It bothered me a little because this is exactly what mobile ordering/calling ahead is for. So they were causing the line to build up. All the employees were making this order, 3-4 more people got in line while I was waiting.\n\nWhat made me say something was when the place ran out of shredded cheese - that's a problem with management and shouldn\u2019t have happened. But the staff realized it when about half of the order was finished, and had to tell the couple this.\n\nTheir response was to have the crew disassemble all the food and make them redistribute the cheese across the rest. By this time I\u2019d been 4th in line for 15 minutes and like 10 more people had come in. People in line were starting to get upset and complain to the STAFF, which was making me angry. The crew was doing their best and this couple was actively making their job harder.\n\nA great way to piss me off is for entitled people to cause service workers problems. So I said \u201cWhat the hell are you guys doing? Do you see the line of people waiting to order? Why are you doing this to the employees, just take your order and go\u201d The husband said that Chipotle ran out of cheese and the staff needed to fix it.\n\nThis Chipotle is in a plaza directly across from a Trader Joes, so I pointed to it and said \u201cGo get some! Then you can have as much cheese as you want!\u201d The husband said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to\u201d. I said \u201cAre you kidding me? Yeah, it sucks, but you\u2019re making things MUCH WORSE, and you can fix it yourself.\u201d He told me to mind my own business, I said they\u2019re making their problem EVERYONE\u2019S, AND they used up the cheese (it would have run out soon anyway but I wasn\u2019t feeling generous).\n\nI wanted to embarrass them into just leaving. Their entitlement won and they stayed, so I stood with my arms folded and glared at them. At this point I just didn\u2019t want them to feel okay about doing this and to make them think about it in the future. The employees weren\u2019t saying anything to me, and continued as usual once the couple finally left (after like 30 minutes). I did apologize to the cashier for causing a scene and they said not to worry about it.\n\nI ended up getting queso sauce on my burrito instead of shredded cheese, and I think I might like it better.\n\nTL;DR AITA for angrily calling out a couple who were knowingly holding up a huge line and making the staff\u2019s job much harder than it should have been?", "created_utc": 1701107920, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18593up/aita_for_causing_a_scene_at_chipotle/", "score": 495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did try to offer them a solution but I also admit I didn't need to be as aggressive about it", "I didn't say they were an innocent--- thats disingenous of you to read into the post. But they certainly were an easier target than Chipotle mgmt, who actually caused the issue.  Im not saying the couple did nothing wrong, but your commentary did nothing for anyone", "NO! Definitely NTA & Thank you for saying what the staff couldn't. I wish more customers had your outspoken attitude.", "NTA and I\u2019m mostly posting to tell you that you should get shredded cheese AND queso", "NTA. That couple was.", "I used to work at Chipotle and let me tell you people like this suck.

Online order or call ahead & let them know what you want & what time you want it if you're too old & stupid to  figure out online ordering (this coming from an old lady). \n* You, eh, very low level AH but I like it. Sometimes AH behaviour is warranted & in this case I think that couple deserved it. \n* Other customers, also low level AHs for not backing your sentiment.", "ESH, but screw it, I wish more people were like you and would speak up.

I applaud you.", ">I acknowledge that IA probably TA, or that ESH at least\n\nNot even in the slightest.

Assholes like that don't deserve cheese.", "I wouldn't even attempt an order like that in person, I would want to do it online to make sure I got everything correct and that it was done by the time I got there lol", "I think I agree with that. Staff should have realized a massive order was happening and pulled them to the side to fill out a catering sheet or something so it could be side prepped while the regular orders were not getting backed up.

We try our best to prep everything in the morning it honestly just depends on if the warehouse has what we need or if we ordered enough.

It didn't make the situation better for the workers. It just made stuff tense and added another thing on their plates.\n\nNope. I dread the thought of dealing with people like either of you. That's a not even worth it I'm out scenario.", "Even without a smart phone, they likely have some kind of phone and could have at least called ahead. People have been ordering by phone for at least 40 years and probably longer. And if they are making multiple orders, there were other people involved, probably family with it being a holiday weekend, and I just can't believe that out of a whole family of multiple people, there was not one person who could have figured out how to order online or call ahead.", "I suppose a better way to put it is if you're placing that big of an order, it *should* be done ahead of time... but, I see your point and agree, on it's own, it's an entirely excusable thing and wouldn't have led to an AITA post. It's when you add in the having their order deconstructed and remade that escalates them from annoying to major AH. And once you reach major AH level, you invite the assessment of assholery upon whatever other dumb shit you did.", "Dunno bout that. I got it once when it first came out, kind of tasteless to me.", "I also know a Trader Joe\u2019s with this combination AND I have experienced that Chipotle run out of ingredients (including the queso sauce, sadly)", "No. The staff is probably still laughing about the guy that called out the cheese distribution people for their entitled stupidity.

Management wanted the sell, so they took the order at the inconvenience of anyone waiting in line.

And it takes FOREVER. And when they run out, one person has to go get a tray of cut cheese (hopefully enough was prepped by morning shift or else that\u2019s a whole other step), hook up the grater (if there\u2019s room, my store didn\u2019t have room for shit), then slowly grate 5-6 inch cheese cubes into a new pan, date/label it, THEN they can put it on the line \n\n\nI think I\u2019m having flashbacks now ugh", "Okay fair enough.  I interviewed for a management job and they told me about how much of the morning was prepping so everything was fresh.  I wasn\u2019t sure if that was the case for cheese or not.  Thanks for clearing it up.", "Honestly, would have clapped and asked for chips.", "We could have offered to fight the old people for the cheese- that seems like a good use of my Sunday afternoon.", "I\u2019d have been cheering OP on lol. Way to tell them off OP! \n\nNTA at all IMO, that group in front of you seemed rude, entitled, and needed to be put in their place.", "Not every Chipotle takes phone orders.\n\nIt's interesting how many people --- not of the old demographic --- just refuse to accept that placing an order in person is a valid way of doing it. \n\nAs I mentioned, not every Chipotle will take phone orders. But they *all* take orders in person. Hmm, why do you think that is?\n\nSince you seem to be so convinced that Chipotle shouldn't take orders above a certain size in person, why don't you contact them and suggest that? I'll lay very good money on them not implementing your suggestion.", "Fair enough.", "Is there a policy for how many bowls a single person can order in line? More than 3 sounds unreasonable even if they're organized", "Also a former Chipotle employee, verifying that cheese was delivered in blocks and shredded on-site.", "my arms hurt just from reading about carrying the cheese lmao", "A slow clap like in the movie Rudy.", "I would've been recording I love drama like this", "Fair point if some don't take phone orders, I didn't know that was a possibility. Maybe it's because I'm in a rural state, but I've not ever tried to call in an order to a restaurant who refused it. However, to be fair, I never said that Chipotle shouldn't have taken the order, or that ordering in person is not valid. But I don't understand how multiple people planned this order and no one thought, Gee, this might be a lot to order in person without warning and I wonder if there is a better way to do it.", "The only way.", "I managed just part of a garden centre in my youth (I was 23 and very good at my job which the older ladies hated anyway boss loved me) and it had a cafe in it, one day delivery didn\u2019t show up, I was managing that day cause my awesome boss was off, I called him to okay it but I took two of the teen Saturday girls to the local supermarket and bought everything they didn\u2019t have and things they might run out of before the shop opened officially, they ran out of butter and bread at 1 pm cause every fucker wanted a sandwich that day - English people butter bread - so I went back out and got it. I\u2019m not going to let my girls get yelled at cause grandma can\u2019t have her egg and cress on brown. Did it cost the store more that day? Sure but they still did a good trade and a lot more that if we\u2019d have to keep saying sorry we don\u2019t have xyz today. Paying a little extra and putting more work in in an emergency makes your staff comfortable and doesn\u2019t alienate customers. An approach I rarely see in corporate and retail environments these days which is a shame.", "I feel like clapping just sitting here reading this.\n\nThe former food service worker in me wants to extend a special thank you to you OP! \ud83d\udc4f"]}
