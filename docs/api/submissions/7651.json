I have this neighbor getting deliveries 3-4 times a week, I can't deal with it, he is not a dick about it, but he obviously just expects someone to be there and accept his stuff.

She might be using a stolen credit card for the purchases that she then has delivered to your address. This is a pretty common scam and also happened to a friend of mine.
