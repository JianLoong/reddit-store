If he's carrying most of it in his mid-section, then yeah...he's probably at risk of developing a few conditions at his age.\n\nSince you pay for 75 percent of everything, you're under no obligation to provide additional snack foods. If he wants them, he can go out and buy them himself. \n\nYou guys have a somewhat unhealthy dynamic...telling each other you'd leave if the other ceased meeting your physical expectations etc...I mean, that doesn't really fill anyone with joy and security.", "NTA, you\u2019re allowed to no longer be attracted to a person if they engage in destructive behavior.", "NTA but the way you brought up and talked through those problems is not the right way. I was fat all my youth and my big brother would say things the same way you did, and i can tell you it's not the right way to adress this kind of behaviour. Try to explain the situation objectively and not through the spectrum of your relation. Making him really take notice of what's wrong and taking an active part of the healing process little by little might be a better way imo", "NTA. You had good intentions and expressed your concern and support . you had an argument ,things are gonna be said .", "YTA. I totally get you being concerned about his health and you should be. However, getting angry and saying something so heinously evil to your significant other is appalling. If you are not married and not happy in the relationship, then end it. But to say something that will scar this man for years to come...damn lady.", "NTA\n\nWhen you love someone who's obviously developed an eating disorder you stop enabling that eating disorder.\n\nI'm sure I'm going to regret asking, but were the chips and marshmallows part of a single snack eaten together or for different snacking needs?", "Overeating is a symptom. Making people lose weight or eat less will not work unless the underlying reason why people do not take their personal health seriously is addressed.", "YTA. Look, I get that you're concerned about your husband's health and well-being, but the way you're approaching the situation is not cool, bro.\r  \n\r  \nFirst of all, making weight gain the sole focus of your concern is unfair. People's bodies change over time, and weight gain can happen for various reasons, especially during challenging times like the pandemic. Shaming him for his weight and telling him he'd leave you if the situation were reversed is hurtful and insensitive.\r  \n\r  \nInstead of supporting and encouraging him in a positive way, you're using guilt and manipulation. Refusing to buy him snacks as a form of punishment is not constructive. It only leads to more tension and resentment in your relationship.\r  \n\r  \nYour husband has the right to make his own choices about his fitness journey. If he's not interested in going to the gym or following your diet recommendations, that's his decision. You can express your concerns, but ultimately, it's his body and his life.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, body shaming and telling him he's unattractive is just plain mean, bro. You should love and support your partner regardless of their physical appearance. It's important to have open and honest communication, but it should be done with kindness and understanding.\r  \n\r  \nInstead of being judgmental and controlling, try having a calm and compassionate conversation with your husband about your concerns for his health. Encourage him to seek professional guidance and offer support in a non-judgmental way. Remember, bro, it's not about how he looks, but about his overall well-being and happiness.", "It\u2019s not about not buying the snacks. It\u2019s what you said to him that makes YTA. Even if he loses weight and goes to gym he\u2019s not gonna forget what u said and how u made him feel and your lack of empathy and support. Holy shit.", "ESH but I get why. It is really hard situation you're being put in. 95 lbs gained on 5'6\" is a lot.", "yta. \"I'm worried about how fat you are\" is always, always bullshit. you may just be very ignorant about how actual healthy bodies look, but more likely you just hate fat ppl, and you're being a dick to your husband.  spend.some time listening to Maintence phase and Aubrey Gordon, and let the man live.", "YTA. You don't want that man anymore. Stop kidding yourself.", "YTA but imo only because of what you\u2019ve said to him. If he was once a fitness buff and no longer cares about his physical appearance then there is likely an underlying issue. \n\nHave a serious talk about your concerns without making him feel undesirable and insecure about the weight gain. The pandemic hit some people hard in various ways. Talk.", "YTA", "I'll go with NTA you communicate what your needs are it's harsh but he somehow became a depressed couch potato and this is not what you singed up for.\n\nHe absolutely needs therapy but he might refuse as he also refused to join you at the gym.\n\nIt's difficult but this relationship might be over.", "OP I get you\u2019re trying to do the right thing for Lorn.  The problem is you\u2019re going about it in the wrong way.

I'm someone who is working on losing weight for medical reasons. I wish when growing up, my parents cared enough about my eating disorders to not buy snacks I'd binge on. When I asked them to, I was straight-up told it was too much of an inconvenience for them. It's clear you care about your husband and want him to become a healthier person. You haven't mentioned anything about his looks beyond that he would leave you if you got to the point he has. It's obvious to me that you genuinely care about his health. Please remember that sugar addiction is a very real thing, and so is addiction to carbs, and eating disorders aren't always skinny people restricting food. I'm not saying he has an eating disorder. More than likely, he's addicted to sugar/carbs. I'm just saying it's a complicated issue, and if he's not just an asshole in general, it's very possible that intervening in his addiction could cause him to act out in unusual ways. Nevertheless, if he wants chips and marshmallows he can get them himself.", "Paying for the groceries means you get to control what he eats? I understand your concern about health but the way you\u2019re going about this is just plain mean. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want to go to the gym with you why not go for a nice walk instead? Why not meal plan together instead of demanding he cut out sugar? \n\nTreating him this way will inevitably lead him to turning to food for comfort because it sure sounds like he won\u2019t get it from you.\n\nYTA.", "YTA COVID depression is rough. His tastes didn't all of a sudden change. He needs therapy to help him pinpoint his issues and why he's using junk food as a coping mechanism. A therapist will be able to tactfully work it out with him. \n\nI also resent that you started with 'I make 3 times as much as he does and I pay this, this, and this. Now that it's understood that he's financially dependent on me and that he should just accept me belittling him, let's talk about how fat and unattractive he is.'\n\nLook, I get it, something is happening to the man you love and you feel helpless. You need to ask him to go with you to  couple counseling.", "NTA. He thought he was going to be a smart ass, and make you feel bad. You just served it back. He has support, and a gym buddy, but he ignores your help. He's just going to get fatter, if he does nothing. I certainly wouldn't be buying him snacks. He's grown and can shop for himself.", "Nta\n\nThe basis of your relationship was fitness and clean eating. Him gaining 100 lb in just a couple years is dangerous. You are not saying he could not have unhealthy snacks, just that you were not going to buy them", "YTA 100%. Instead of being an asshole, you should apologize and talk to your husband about why he\u2019s been eating so much.", "YTA for what you said to him. But I don't think it's wrong to tell him that he has to buy his own junk food. He is harming himself and you'd be enabling him to just keep bringing home terrible food. He can always go to the store himself and buy his junk food with his money instead of you making it easy for him. Or really for stuff like chips and marshmellows, Amazon will probably ship that stuff to him.", "YTA", "YTA - was borderline ESH but I strongly feel that if the roles were reversed people would be yelling about emotional and financial abuse \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "YTA absolutely", "ESH. You guys sounds toxic, yikes. Honestly if he told you before that he would leave you for gaining weight that was a huge red flag you ignored. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s OK for you to use that now as a means of manipulating him into losing weight out of guilt and insecurity. \n\nThen he tells you he isn\u2019t attracted to you anymore and that you\u2019d look better if you gained weight? Another read flag. He is trying to make himself feel better by dragging you down instead of addressing whatever the root issue is. \n\nHonestly he is probably dealing with depressions. Suggest therapy not the gym. His physical won\u2019t get better until his mental does.", "I'm obese myself, but NTA.", "YTA. Comments are very telling- you\u2019re dying in this hill of being justified in controlling your partners life, but I\u2019m damn near positive if this was flipped it would be glaringly obvious to YOU how hurtful and wrong it would be. Holding onto past comments (him saying he\u2019d leave if you gained weight) will only hurt your relationship more than what you\u2019ve already done to it. You\u2019re clearly l getting off on this power trip over his life, and frankly if you can\u2019t let go of what he\u2019s said and keep turning it into justification for how you just verbally and emotionally battered him- you should seek help and be single so he can find someone who accepts him. Again. YTA.", "YTA.  Body shame much?", "Nta you were mean towards the end but he needs to care and love himself too.", "If you came on here and told us that you gained 95 lbs and he dumped you I think people would tear him apart on your behalf, you might want to think about if you're treating him how you believe a spouse should be treated. But he can also get his own damn snacks right??? So a soft yta from me", "YTA\n\nHe does not owe you thinness. He does not owe you a static, unchanging personality, or habits. Especially in an ongoing pandemic. \n\n This did not happen overnight, so for you to make a stink over it now is not his problem. \n\n\"Junk food\" is an unhelpful label. You can get just as fat from homemade gourmet food as you can fast food. Or chips. If the man wanted marshmallows to eat a smore every night, that's his business and won't make him gain weight in moderation. \n\nStop policing him and talk. Or better yet, leave. He's better off without you.", "YTA just admit you don\u2019t find him attractive anymore and leave the relationship rather than emotionally abuse him", "Lorn needs to go home to his mom, pack his bags.", "INFO: have you/he looked into medical conditions that could be causing this weight gain? Has he started a new medication? Is he suffering from mental health issues? Would he leave you or be upset if you gained weight?\n\nIf any of the weight gain is because of medical issues it\u2019s kind of cruddy if you to hold that over him. On the other hand if he would truly leave you if you gained that much weight (as you said) that is also not great on his part. Bodies change, health conditions appear. Depression happens. You both seem to have very high standard for the other persons body, which isn\u2019t great. If he holds standards for you that he isn\u2019t keeping himself then I can see your frustration.", "ESH.
