Will they be available to report back?\n\nYou're a dad, so you know what 11yo boys are really like. More importantly, you know your 11yo boy. If your gut says no, then that's a NO.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't shut it down. I'd negotiate.  Does he get good grades? does he do chores without asking? Does he show maturity in any way?

I said because it's different when you have more kids in the house.\n\nWhat you're communicating is that your son will have to go somewhere else to hang out with his friends, so that's what he'll do. If he's pushing this hard at 11, it won't get any easier when he's older. And if your response is \"my house, my rules\", it **definitely** won't get any easier.\n\nI think this is less about who's the AH and more about how you get to somewhere reasonable. E.g.\n\n>I'd be fine with it if my son was in middle school, showed he was responsible and his friends were respectful.\n\nHave you communicated this to him? Have you told him what worries you? Have you explained specifically what he needs to do in order to gain your trust and gain further privileges?\n\nAs it stands, NAH, but not heading in a good direction.", "soft YTA.\n\n>I have middle and high school boys in and out of the house too\n\nI mean you have to see why he might be a bit upset seeing as how these middle and high school boys (assuming friends of your other children) are able to come and go as they please. he can't prove he is responsible if you don't give him a chance, lay out some ground rules for how they should behave when you're gone and see if he can stick to it, if not then you can be stricter about it, but as it is now to him it probably just seems like you are unfairly keeping his friends from coming over.\n\nAlso,\n\n>I told her that bothers me and it's irresponsible.\n\nreally not cool dude you have no idea what the dynamic of that household is, you asked her for her opinion you cant get mad at her when you don't like it.", "NAH - That's a very sensible boundary and it's completely normal that he's challenging you on it.
