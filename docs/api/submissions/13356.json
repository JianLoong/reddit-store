I was not in the wedding party (and didn't expect to be.)\n\nWe live on the opposite side of the state and drove down on Friday for my husband to attend the bachelor party, and were running late so we drove directly to the barcade where the party was at instead of swinging by our hotel first. I figured I would just drop my husband off, but Ted very sincerely invited me to join the festivities and my husband was happy for me to join too, so I did. We did the whole barcade thing with beers and pizza and then went to an adult entertainment venue\u2014not an outright strip club, more like an 18+ comedy burlesque show. We all had a good time (I thought) and I had some good conversations with the other groomsman but never felt like I was monopolizing anyone's time or drawing a lot of attention to myself.\n\nWell...me, my husband, and Ted all had a good time at the bachelor party and didn't have any issues. Apparently some of the other groomsmen didn't like that a woman joined the party at the last minute, and they told the bride, who texted me later saying that I should have just let the guys have their fun and \"let (my husband) out of my sight for a few hours.\" I feel like this is a little unfair...I joined in because Ted was happy to have me there and it was a fun party, not because I felt like I couldn't let my husband out of my sight.

Not the groomsmen.  You were invited by the groom to multiple places.\n\nGoing with NTA", "NTA - The groom invited you.  It was his party, and if he was happy to have you there, no one else's opinion matters.  Though it sounds like Ted may have fiance issues, as why she felt the need to contact you about attending is beyond me.", "NTA  \n\n\nI can say from firsthand experience that bridal parties often forget that the bachelor/ette party is for the groom or bride, not the groomsman or bridesmaids. So while they might not have liked it, the groom did, and that is what matters.\n\nIt could also be that the groom did not want some 'out of hand' extravagance and your presence kept things of the tone he wanted.\n\nThat said, it really should have been the best man saying whether or not you stayed, but moot point. You did, and you're not an asshole for doing so.", "If Ted invited you, who cares what the groomsmen or the bride thinks. NTA.", "NTA - Give me a break, he asked. Heck, my wife was in the casino I was having my bachelor party at and joined us later. Who cares, we had a blast.", "NAH:  Because I guess you were invited.  But I'm on the groomsman side here. \n\nReason being you're not close to the groom. This was his night with his friends.  Than it became the night with his friends and one friends wife.  It would make more sense if you were apart of the group and all the guys knew you.  But I get the feeling that's not the case.....you should have declined", "NTA - Simply put there was one person with the power to invite you and would only have done so if they genuinely wanted you there. That person was the Groom, no one else, just him. Every one else can have their opinion but it means nothing....", "NAH. The thing is usually a close friend plans the bachelor party. If Ted didn't make it clear he wanted your invited, or that he wanted it co-ed, then the invite was likely courtesy. Even if it was genuine, your presense 100% impacted the night for the other guys who don't know you. Just like women don't want a guy to indrude on girls night bc there are things we talk about we don't want dudes around for, they have their things too. There are also other girl friends and wives to consider. If you were close to Ted, or one of the guys, this would be different. But in this situation, sounds like you were a tag along wife so I get why the other groomsmen might be uncomfortable. In the end though, it's Ted's night and if he wanted you to stay genuinely and not a courtesy invite, then its his choice.   \nI'm a girl who usually ends up at boys poker night. But the guys expect me there and the wives/gfs expect me there and we've all been friends for so long that no one is affected by my presense. Any of the wive/gfs are also invited and anytime that they wouldn't be, I'd also stay home", "Yta - there's a reason no other SOs were invited, including the soon to be bride.", "Gentle YTA.  \n\nOf course it was a courtesy invite, there\u2019s no reason you would have been invited to the bachelor party otherwise. \n\nYes, you should have declined and gone to the hotel as you originally planned. \n\nI\u2019m also confused as to why you made the trip to begin with? Was the bachelor party the night before the actual wedding?", "NTA \n\nLots of bachelor/ bachelorettes meet up at the end of the night. \n\nI don\u2019t see why this is weird at all?\n\nI was invited to a few bachelor parties as I have lots of male friends. No one ever said anything to me", "Light YTA he invited you as a courtesy because you were right there in front of him. You were never intended to be a guest and I think you should have had some awareness of that and declined in order to let them have their night out.", "YTA, Once you saw that you were the only girl there, you should have left and let the guys have a night. A bachelor party is assumed to be all males unless the invite indicated the party would be co-Ed. I\u2019m sure it was awkward for the others guys who don\u2019t know you as well.", "[removed]", "YTA but just a little, I get why you joined. But I think you shouldn't have just thought about ted and your husband's feelings. I get why the groomsman were annoyed. Bachelor parties are a male space and some men feel like they can't fully let loose with another guy's partner there, whether that's right or wrong. Men change the way they act when a woman is around. And perhaps they felt they couldn't relax because you were there. You can say that's sexist or whatever, but it's their feelings.", "NTA. The GROOM invited you. Literally no one else gets to have an opinion on who gets to come to HIS party.", "NTA. You were invited to join in, you all had a good time and you were there hanging with the guys doing the same as the guys. I hate how people can act like nothing is bothering them and even seeming like they're enjoying themselves in the moment and then act like it was the worst thing ever after the fact.\n\nWife has some legitimate points, but it wasn't her night, it was his and he chose to do things differently. She can have an opinion, but there was no reason to make a big deal about it if he didn't.", "NTA\n\nIgnore them. You were invited by the person whose party it was. No one else gets to have a say.\n\nI've been to many bachelor/ette parties that weren't just men or women and everyone had fun. Many people have close friends who aren't the same sex, does that mean they don't get to invite them? That's bs.", "NTA. This is none of the bride and groomsmen business. The GROOM andyour husband where both happy for you to join them, that is all that matters here.", "YTA. You should have just dropped your husband off and gone to the hotel. You were invited as a courtesy and it sounds like your presence ruined the party for those who were invited and accepted their invitation based on no women being there.", "I mean, NTA, but\u2026\n\nAre you *sure* nothing got changed on your account?\n\nIf I was one of Ted\u2019s other guests, I\u2019d probably be a little put off by another dude\u2019s wife showing up last minute.  There\u2019s definitely things that are fun with my friends that I would never consider doing in mixed company.", "NTA. You were invited to stay by the groom, end of story. I suppose the culture around bachelor/bachelorette parties differ a lot from country to country, so some people will think it's weird to have men and women mixed at the same party. Here in Sweden it's getting much more common to have a bit more of a mixed guest list, at least where the bride and groom have close friends or siblings of the opposite/other gender.", "NTA at all. Let people judge, who gives a shit what they think. You were INVITED to stay. They're morons.", "NTA. If I was asked to something like this, and it was ok with my partner, I'd absolutely want to have fun! It's not like you got upset about anything, you were literally \"one of the guys\". \n\nIt's unfortunate the grooms friends didn't view it the same way. But, as long as him, your husband, and you had a good time, the other people aren't very relevant in your life. \n\nAt best, I'd apologize to the bride just to save face.\n\nThe other groomsmen were probably just upset because they felt they had to control themselves a little more since a woman was present.", "YTA. OP if the groom wanted you there, you would have received an invite ahead of the event. You were invited for politeness sake. At the most you should have had one drink and left. Read the room.", "Everyone saying \"read the room\" seem to have been there. How can we talk about what the room was telling when all we have are the facts as stated by OP. I know people who might feel forced to invite someone, but also a lot who would have never ask that out of courtesy. I guess it's all about how is Ted the rest of the time... Which we do not know", "NTA.  You were there from out of town, invited, and had a good time.  Ted might BTA, since he probably excluded other wives, so he put people in a bad situation.    But if you and your husband are good, don't worry about outside influences.", "YTA. Of course he politely invited you but common sense should have said this is for the men. Your husband will forever be known as the guy with his wife at the bachelor party\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "YTA\n\nYou know that bachelor parties are for men. You should have declined. By staying you must have made them uncomfortable because they likely wanted to joke around and couldn't as much because you were there.", "NTA\n\nThe only person\u2019s opinion that matters as to whether or not you \u201cshould\u201d have accepted the invitation is the person who invited you himself. \n\nIf it was a \u201ccourtesy invitation\u201d\u2026 meaning you were apparently supposed to read someone\u2019s mind to figure out that you were \u201csupposed\u201d to decline, instead of them communicating like an adult (or not offering to begin with), that still leaves you as not being the AH in my opinion. \n\nI think you made the right call, as you stated that you have a legitimate friendship with the groom. It\u2019s not unreasonable at all for him to have invited you, or for you to have accepted.", "The groom invited you, everyone else can get over themselves.  NTA.", "NTA as long as hubby and the groom were good. That\u2019s the important thing. If most of them were. Even better. \nI was invited to a bachelor party, they wanted a DD. Bachelorette was the same weekend. I chose the girls.  But I totally would have gone with the guys and had fun too.", "NTA. You were asked by the groom. It's the grooms choice who goes on their bachelor party. My brother had two women invited to his bachelors. One was his partner from work, and one his bestie. \n\nGroom gets the final word and it doesn't have to be all men.", "Yep. NAH  but you should have dropped him and checked in to the hotel.", "YTA sounds like you don't trust your husband so you tagged along to a bachelor party. I bet you are always looking through his phone and track his location.", "NAH, you just learned about the polite invite and that you're not supposed to accept it because ???? societal rules. It's like how people ask how are you but don't actually want to know. \n\nThere's also a chance Tom was suspect of some of the plans made for him and used you to get around having to blanket reject them or get cajoled into them. I was lucky my best friend told my friends absolutely not to a surprise craigslist stripper, but maybe he doesn't have anyone on his side to make that call without him seeming like a bad sport.", "NTA / ted asked you to join. it\u2019s his party", "NTA tell her \u201cI was invited\u2026\u2026by the groom\u2026\u2026there is no further discussion on the matter\u201d", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you crashed the party uninvited, Ted literally asked you to join them. And he\u2019s the groom, it\u2019s his party, so if wanted you there it\u2019s fine. You weren\u2019t doing anything inappropriate.", "Kind of.\nIt's a bachelor party. You ruined their fun.", "NAH but yeah, you probably should have declined the invite. It's not fair for them to blame you, though.", "YTA. Someone planned and paid for that bachelor party. They set the guest list. Yes, the groom is the guest of honor, but he is not the host to extend the invitation, he is the recipient. The party planners didn\u2019t invite you to stay and that should have been a cue to leave", "YTA its a party for men not women. Would you be comfortable if a man joined a bachelor party for women?", "NAH. You were invited by the groom who was celebrating. Having said that. Having a woman around on any night does change behavior and does change the dynamic of the event.", "This is a tough one - I don\u2019t think you should have gone bc it\u2019s traditionally just men and you were invited last minute as a courtesy, but you didn\u2019t invite yourself so I guess more a tacky NTA.", "NAH. You did nothing wrong and it was nice of the groom to invite you and I\u2019m glad you had a good time. But, if I was any of the other husbands\u2019 wives I\u2019d be a bit Suspicious (not knowing what fully happened). They might be wondering why was only 1 wife invited, why wasn\u2019t I? They shouldn\u2019t have been rude but they were (naturally) expecting a boys weekend, which didn\u2019t happen.", "NTA. Many men plan to cheat on their partners during a bachelor party. This is why they were mad you were there.", "NTA and I'm impressed you had a hotel room to go to.  Hotels get cranky when you don't check in usually by 3 pm.", "Oh this is so interesting!

With friends especially, I would\u2019ve taken them at face value and behaved precisely like OP. \n\nIf this is the case of a nonvitation, is it expected for other people to politely decline as a social convention? (Eg: do most people know this is a thing?) If anything, her partner should\u2019ve politely pulled her aside to give her a heads up as he knows the groom better. \n\nNAH. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a real invite? Maybe it was and the groom\u2019s wishes should be respected? Perhaps some members of the party who took issue with this should\u2019ve spoken to OP before tattling to the groom\u2019s fianc\u00e9? Honestly, the logic here is exhausting and everyone needed to communicate better with one another. Sounds like OP would\u2019ve respected their privacy had it been made clear that was the preference. No one is a mind reader, and if your presence was enough to \u201cruin the night\u201d, they need to communicate those expectations.", "That behavior is what causes problems. An invitation should be an invitation just as no means no. Anything else is performative bs that you and others should stop doing. In the long run it ends up hurting the invited person more than just not inviting them.\n\nThe groom was happy. His voice is the only one that matters and not a couple of groomsmen who probably refrained from being assholes because she was there.", "NTA. Friday night bachelor party, Saturday wedding? You probably saved the whole shebang. Groom probably saw you and invited you so that his friends wouldn't force him to get out of hand. This scenario is literally the worst idea in the history of weddings. The groom absolutely needed a brake on the drunkenness, so that he could function at his wedding the next day.", "I disagree, I think women are the same exact way. most women change their behavior just a bit when a man is around vs all women, it's a comfort thing. People act differently with the same gender vs in mixed groups, I think.", "I\u2019m neurotypical and it wouldn\u2019t have occurred to me that someone\u2019s invite is not an actual invite. If they don\u2019t want me to go, don\u2019t ask, so I don\u2019t think most people know that it\u2019s a thing. But I also get really tired of people\u2019s social conventions of saying something they don\u2019t mean.", "NTA, he invited you and seemed sincere. You participated in everything and had fun. The groom had fun. Your husband had fun. No harm, no foul.", "NtA, you didn't crash the party, or guilt trip you way in. The groom invited you, all you have to worry about", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her that her husband asked you to stay and party with him and your husband was ok with it too. Maybe the groomsmen were upset because the party was kept a little tamer by you being there. That could have been Ted's reason for inviting you because he knew his buddies would go overboard and he didn't want to go along with what they had planned.", "NTA. I think at the end of the day, the two people who\u2019s feelings matter most in this regard (Ted and your husband) we\u2019re both excited and happy to have you there. \n\nIf there was some specific issue with you it might be one thing, but the complaint seems to just be that you\u2019re a woman, which is ridiculous.", "NTA I am a woman and was the best \"man\" for a dear friend's wedding. Along with his brothers, the groomsmen, we did all of the usual bachelor party stuff and no one made it weird or fell back on tired gender roles. A party is a party. An invite is an invite. If the groom did not want you there, he should have spoken up as it was HIS party.", "It's the night for the groom to have a good time right before the wedding.\n\nThe groom.\n\nThe one that invited her.\n\nKnow what we did for our wedding? A group activity with our friends because we didn't really want or need a separate thing.\n\nThe groom is an adult and perfectly capable of deciding what will make him happy at his party. So unless he's bitching, other people can pound sand.", "Nobody does courtesy invites to a bachelor's party. That just doesn't happen.", "How old are we that we feel awkward because a \u201cgirl\u201d was there? Get a grip, Ted invited her.", "I really don\u2019t see the issue with a woman being at the party especially when the groom wanted her there.", "Maybe that was why Ted very sincerely invited her. Plenty of times groomsmen had planned stuff that the grooms did not want to participate in. Ted may have wanted less shenanigans and was happy for her to go.", "If someone's gonna be so insincere as to send out a \"nonvitation\" they deserve to have that back-fire on them. That's wouldn't be nice, it's pretending to be nice to look good. \n\n\\- Though I'm not convinced that's actually what happened.", "oh my god if you don't want someone there don't invite them but you sound so dumb rn the GROOM had fun w her. he wanted her there. boo hoo. a woman joined in on a man's event. cry about it. NTA.", "Bullshit. Of all events bachelor and bachelorette parties are the least needing of nonvitations. Everybody understands the conventions. If the groom is inviting OP it is because he wants her there.", "Nope, \u201chey - look forward to seeing you tomorrow\u201d is a nonvitation. The groom was not obligated to include her nor did OP force her way in.", "One of my husband\u2019s groomsmen and his wife came down from out of state for our wedding. She ended up joining the bachelor party, too, and everyone had a good time\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s that weird or wrong", "Excellent deduction\u2026 I think you really are a scientist.", "\"because I'm awesome\" I threw up in my mouth at this lmao", "\ud83e\udd18", "This. No wife is going to get invited to a bachelor party by accident. A quick \u201chello and thanks for dropping off your husband, look forward to seeing you at the wedding\u201d is all anyone would need.", "This is what I thought when I read the story. Except that I was thinking along the female buffer so that his friends didn\u2019t push getting him too involved with strippers at the end of the night. \n\nBest bachelor parties that I have been to had 1 or 2 women. The scummy guys tend to act better if there is a woman around to report back to their partners how they acted.", "It's the \"we should of get coffee sometime\" invitation. Very rarely does anyone mean it.", "OP wrote \"I like  Ted a lot and consider him a friend too, we just aren't as close as he and my husband are.\"\n\nWhere did you get this from?  \n\n>someone she barely knows\n\n>when you barely talk to the guy", "But \u201cpull-up a chair, order a drink\u201d is pretty clear in the moment.", "\"Pull up a chair, order *A* drink\" to me does not give an open invitation for the whole evening. That, for me, is a quick beer, a hello to everyone, and then to the hotel. It's not a \"I invite you to all the festivities\" invitation.\n\n\nBut what do I know? I've never been to a bachelor party, never been married, and never found anyone who remotely peaked my interest in the two. As far as I know, it could be an open invitation thing to all spouses. Or it might not. I always try to err on the side of caution when it comes to unknown situations. In this case, politely decline.", "Sounds like the groom kept inviting and including her.", "Info: I suppose my question would be why weren't you initially invited from the onset if the groom wanted you there...I'm questioning whether the bride was told by some random groomsman or by the groom.", "INFO: \n\nWhen he asked you did you accept right away or did he have to insist a bit?", "I would have declined.", "Yta. The groom was being kind and you stayed at a party that you didn't have the original invite from the person who organised the party. \nYou aren't even a part of the wedding party and stayed for the bachelor party.", "My \"bachelor party\" was couples bowling with everyone invited and you invited to drop him off but were invited to stay so NTA", "NTA you were invited, everyone else needs to get over it.", "NTA. He invited you to join.", "NTA. A \u201cnoninvitation\u201d is the vague promise of a future meeting that allows you to END the current one. \n\nThis was a sincere invite. The bride is just jealous OP was invited and she wasn\u2019t.", "I guess NTA, but it would be weird if I was at the party", "NTA\n\nYou've been invited by the groom.", "Thank you for summarizing literally every single AITA.", ">I\u2019m sure it was awkward for the others guys who don\u2019t know you as well.\n\nI mean, bachelor parties have always been awkward for me when I've been around people I don't know, but I wouldn't call anyone an asshole for being there.", "I mean, even if it *was* a 'courtesy invite', quite frankly, that's still on Ted.\n\nYou can't extend an invite like that and then get upset if it's accepted. You learn that lesson and then remember next time that you have to be more direct (but still polite) with that person, and then you move on because not everyone is going to pick up on that cue and frankly, I think it's a stupid fucking idea to begin with.\n\nAs other people have said, all you'd need to say is' Hey thanks for dropping (husband) off, see you at the wedding!' or something like that.", "Exactly. There\u2019s a full spectrum of bachelor parties, with family-friendly fun at one end, and unbridled hedonism and debauchery at the other. Me personally - the more the merrier, but i I have known guys in my past that view it as \u201cI\u2019m spending $500 tipping strippers and then cheating on my wife with a hooker because it\u2019s my friend\u2019s bachelor party.\u201d Groom has every right to foster the atmosphere he wants for the party.", "Yeah, this whole thing people seem to have with 'you were meant to politely decline!' is just... dude, just don't fucking invite people then?\n\nIf OP was like 'Hey can I come?', then *maybe* they'd be the asshole because it'd be kind of awkward for one of the grooms men's wife to ask to come along and it puts the pressure on the groom/best man to then have to either allow it or be the bad guy who shoots them down.\n\nBut if someone extends the offer apropos of nothing, then it's on *them*.", "Confused autism gang, lol", "Same!! I\u2019ve been to numerous bachelor parties because I was a competitive hockey player and have a tone of male friends.  \n\nI went on a 4 day bachelor party to Portland with the guys from my curling team (3 dudes and me for mixed league). One of the other invited guys that I didn\u2019t know told his gf (a complete stranger) and she tried to get the groom in trouble.  Even his fianc\u00e9 said, \u201cwhat hippo she\u2019s one of the guys.\u201d", "god forbid someone have self esteem /s", "difference between self esteem and conceitedness. to say \"I was invited because I'm awesome\" is such a \"I'm not like other girls\" statement.", "If the groom didn't want her there a quick hello and look forward to seeing you tomorrow would have been the way to go not an invite.", "But other girls are also awesome, lol"]}
