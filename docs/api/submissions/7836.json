Nice!", "NTA\n\nYou didn't owe him anything, he owed you. Maybe if he hadn't treated you so shoddily you might have forgiven him part of the debt, but part of that debt wasn't to you it was to your Dad, so why he'd expect to be forgiven that when it was your circumstances that had changed is beyond me. He's just seen that you are doing very well for yourself since the breakup and feels entitled to a bit of it, well he's not, he threw that all away a long time ago.", "NTA. And good thing he didn\u2019t know.  He will get the deposit back on the flat if he leaves it in good order, so he should be quiet.

That comment made my night.", "NTA it was owed to you. Period.", "NTA. Esp as a lot of it was just the deposit on the flat! The thing about grace is that it's nothing you can earn and he wanted grace from you when you can't ask for it. \n\nAlso the wedding deposit debt is symbolic of him shattering your heart/betraying you so it's definitely understandable you wanted him to pay your dad back bc he was about to join your family.", "NTA.
