Do it few times for few different occasions if she\u2019s making you late. Beforehand I would record the conversation where you tell her that you are going to go on your own if she\u2019s running late and make sure you record when she says she gets it and understand it.

You need to have a serious conversation about what's behind this. Why is she insisting on making you late, when she knows that this is important to you? If the best she can do is that it's not important to be on time, that's not good enough - because it's important to you, and if she cares about you, that should mean something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Hell, they\u2019re probably not there either.", "Good for you.", "As a recently diagnosed adult ADHD woman, can confirm. This sounds like what I do every day, even if I don't really want to.", "some people use multiple pronouns (she/they, he/they) so it could just be switching between them in this case", "If this is New Orleans MG, Im going to give you a very unpopular opinion of  NAH or YTA.  For almost any other situation, sure - NTA, people should be on time and respect boundaries. \n\nBut..... Mardi Gras is its own thing. Trying to consistently get anywhere on time during MG is absolutely impossible, and tbh 2 hours late is not that late for an MG ball.  Even people who are generally very on time people are late, because a) there is so much to do constantly and b) your brain doesn't work right and c) you are exhausted and d) costuming/dressing goes awry and e) getting places is hard and you never know when you will be stuck somewhere thanks to parade traffic and f) cell phones and connections don't work consistently.  If you have never done the full carnival season (not just talking about MG day), its incredibly hard to explain but its part of the joy and the fun of it.  Stressing about being on time.... youre going to drive yourself crazy pants and miss out on a big part of the freedom and joy.   And you KNOW that its not as easy as \"get another ride\" or \"drive yourself\" because that is 100% not always available or possible depending on where you are.  And honestly, where and why the hell are you driving TWO HOURS to get to an MG ball?  if youre not in NOLA then idk if the above applies because I havent done MG outside of here, but.... dang.  It is what it is.\n\nNow I would vote NAH because it is also very common to be separated and have plans change and leave people behind and find new ones, etc during MG and your partner should have been aware and they should be able to adapt.  But MG is not the time to be strict or up tight, for either of you.", "NTA. Her behavior is controlling. Are you want be with an AH?", "NTA, your date is disrespectful of other people's times. It would be one thing if this was maybe a BBQ with friends (and that's STILL pushing it) but a formal event? Nah that's rude as heck", "As someone who is habitually late, NTA. However, the things I'm late for are typically things I have no interest in. Could this be the issue with your partner? It might be Wirth a conversation, especially if they avoid being late to their events.", "NTA. Your partner is a disrespectful AH. If she did that \u201cfashionably late\u201d crap to me, you would be invited to attend my future events solo. \n\nIt\u2019s just this simple, if you have so little respect for my time, why should I respect you at all?", "Nta", "NTA.  Being \"fashionably late\" is complete bs and is just a excuse to be rude.  You made the requirements to go with you known ahead of times and they chose to ignore you.  Next time they want to go they should think about not ignoring you and thinking so little of people.  Now, you do have to have the same requirement for every event from now on and can't backtrack or they will continue being rudely late.", "NTA: My family are always late to depart for airport trips. It drives me absolutely insane to fight traffic and the have to run for a flight. So guess what - I tell them the flight is at 2:30pm when it's really at 4pm. They can be an hour late and we still make it. They are surprised and even upset at the ruse then promptly forget so I can do it again! I suggest all your events start at '6pm' instead of 8pm. Try it.", "NTA. Keep doing this.", "NTA, but just start telling her she needs to be ready two hours earlier so she's ready on time. Trust me, I'm also chronically late. For important events or things we have to be to at a certain time my boyfriend and family tell me I need to be there about 30 minutes earlier than I need to be since I'm normally about 20 minutes late.", "NTA and keep doing it!  She will get it together (I hope)", "NTA People like this drive me crazy. I would never ever be able to date someone like that. I like to be 10 mins early, in case shit crops up that would other wise make me late. \n\n Time to have a talk now about how they are not respecting you or your time by doing this and going forward you can either go separately or they can be ready to go when you are.", "NTA", "Being late is not fashionable.  NTA", "Being hours late is not fashionable.  NTA", "NTA. But you might want to consider how much of your time you are willing to waste on someone who has no respect for anyone else's time.", "NTA however your partner is for clearly putting no effort into being on time. She is being inconsiderate not only to you but to the hosts.", "NAH\n\nShe does not share your views on arriving to parties on time.\n\n1) she would care if someone else was late, so doesn't expect the host to care. 2) same. 3) why would she drive fast when she doesn't see being late to a party as wrong. 4) Drawing attention is the entire point of the \"fashionably late\" concept.  It's why it used to be a thing for guests of honor to have an arrival time and hour or two after everyone else, so they would be seen arriving. 5) Less important than 4.\n\nShe is refusing to adopt your sentiments on timeliness at parties, and you are refusing to allow her to make you late.  This is an incompatibility issue.", "I absolutely agree that OP is NTA, and in fact did exactly what he should have done: said 'I'm leaving at X', and then left at X.\n\n*However,* I strenuously disagree with OP that he should arrive to every event 15 minutes early. OP, unless you are specifically told to do so, arriving early is also rude; the hosts are probably running around, dealing with last-minute things, and they absolutely do not want guests seeing that. You can arrive on time, but don't arrive early.", "Agreed. My wife is chronically late and feels it\u2019s ok for everyone to wait for her. She has been this way since day one and she is not going to change now after all these years.  It is a cultural thing to some extent.  Where she is from being late is not just ok but expected.  \n\nYou need to decide if you want to live with it.  You can try to change the person but that likely will not work long term.", "I would have been leaving the second time it happened, and let her get her own ride forevermore...sorry, but being late makes me super uncomfortable.", "Arriving early isn\u2019t necessarily rude. If you arrive 15 minutes early and go inside that\u2019s one thing, but being at the location isn\u2019t rude.", "I\u2019m just here to say 2 hours late is wild. That means she\u2019s not even starting to get ready until the event starts. I\u2019m chronically late, makes my bf a little crazy. But like 5-10 minutes late, maximum. And that\u2019s usually bc right when we start walking out the door I realize I forgot earrings or lipstick or something. \n\nIm not excusing her behavior at all, but was this event on a weekday? Bc if she worked a full day, 5:30 might not have been a reasonable time to be ready. The mature thing obviously would have been to let you know that well in advance, maybe ask for a little bit extra time (like 6, maximum) and then do either a much quicker version of getting ready, or front load whatever tasks she could before work (doing her full shower in the morning so she only needed a quick rinse, or doing her hair or nails or whatever early so she could just do a quick touch up instead of a full getting ready routine. Also, if you\u2019re driving and she\u2019s a passenger, packing up some of the last touches to do in the car. I put my earrings and lipstick on in the passenger mirror every time bc it\u2019s not something that HAS to be done at home\u2026)\n\nSo it would still 100% be her fault for not coming up with a strategy to get out the door at the appointed time, or letting you know and asking for a (small) amount of grace (a couple night ago I thought I was almost done but then got mascara in my eye, like smeared on my contact, and had to completely take it out, clean it, put it back in and THEN wiped the mascara tears off my face and start over. My boyfriend was patient and understanding about that one, since it was an extenuating circumstance.) \n\nIdk the 5:30 time does make me wonder if he\u2019s giving her an unrealistic time frame. But she needs to communicate that and also find some compromises that could help cut the time down significantly.", "Pick a gender and stick to it, bouncing around on genders made this difficult to read.", "NTA I would do this every time. It\u2019s rude AF to be that late.", "NTA.  You told her when you were going to leave. And that if she wasn\u2019t ready you would leave without her. And that\u2019s what you did. She has no respect for you or for those throwing these parties.", "NTA. Realistically, you need a different partner. Generally, doing what you did will make most late people shape up. Your friend has refused and thrown in your face that they will NEVER arrive with you anywhere at the time you want to arrive.\n\nIncidentally, I'm not sure where fashionably late is fashionable. No NYC theater will hold the curtain for those who imagine their lateness is fashionable. I don't know of anywhere where concerts don't start because everyone is waiting for latecomers. Dinner at the White House, or with the King, does not wait for the fashionable. So, how do you feel being told you will only ever arrive with the fashionable?\n\nSo now you missed three, or is it four? events that mattered to you. I guess the ball is in your court. Good luck!", "YTA. People who aren't from the south don't know how much effort and money goes into getting ready for one of these events. When you invited her to the ball you implicitly asked her to spend money on either a costume or fancy clothes for the event. \n\nThere are usually hundreds of people who come and go to these events all night long and nobody is going to notice if you are late. In fact being late is a way of life for about half the city of New Orleans. Events don't really start until about 30 minutes after the agreed upon time.\n\nYou are right there is no way anyone going to one of these parties was going to be ready in 30 minutes. And it is super annoying to miss out on a major part the event. I had someone make me 3 hours late to a ball this year, and it off it was my Krewe throwing the ball.\n\nYou would not be an asshole if you lied and told her that the event started an hour ahead of when it really does so you can get there on time.", ">  I don\u2019t understand people who have no respect for others and making someone late and assuming it is absolutely fine to do so is wrong and rude.\n\nWhen people are together for a long enough time, they can start to take their partner for granted.", "I'm changing!\n\nI'll admit, I could be late fairly frequently when growing up and as a young adult, because most of the people I knew were the same, and I didn't understand why anyone else thought it was important. And I'll admit- I let it go on a little too long. I just didn't understand that it actually bothered people for far too long.\n\nThen it clicked one day. I suddenly realised it actually annoyed people I cared about, and since then, I've made a real effort. It wasn't that I didn't care about other people's enjoyment, I just didn't understand that it actually affected their enjoyment (how dense can you be when they're telling you?)\n\nI still mess up sometimes, but more often than not it's because I'm getting myself AND my house ready to leave (ie making sure the pets have food, windows are closed etc) while my husband only gets himself ready (he does help at times- I just mean that the times I run late tend to be when this happens). And I'm trying to get better at making allowances for that.\n\nIt got the the point last winter that we were only 1 minute late meeting friends even after my husband fell on the ice outside our house as we tried to leave the first time, and we had to go back in and check he was ok (when this happened we also let the people we were visiting know that we might be late because of an accident, then updated them when we realised we'd be on time).\n\nAll that to say, people are weird. Don't assume people don't care or can't change- in some circumstances that may not be true. But I also admit I was an AH for too long, and I don't think there's anything wrong with setting the boundary that you don't want to do things with people who don't realised your went to be on time (like I used to be. Sorry to everyone I annoyed- than you for putting up with me and letting me get better. Although ironically the person I initially changed for is now late when meeting me, haha)", "I wonder if OP is prior military. We're taught that we should be places 15 minutes early, no matter what the occasion.", "We are on good terms, but even when we were together she never listened to any suggestions I make. She still asks for my opinion on things to simply ignore it. And she'll do the opposite of what I say, everything blows up and it's still my fault.\n\nBut I will look into it for my daughter for sure thanks. I've noticed she sometimes has trouble sitting still and unless something really interests her even if she enjoys it she loses focus sometimes.", "Or German.", "NTA in this instance but please do NOT arrive early to a party if it's hosted at a house or by a person as opposed to an organization. This is definitely rude and a great way to stress out the host. If it's an event in a public place or something that is different.", "NTA - depending on the event 15 min late is acceptable. Sometimes 15 min early is not acceptable. 2hrs for a Mardi ball is way outside of acceptable. This is going to be an ongoing problem if you do not discuss this and set boundaries. Hopefully this last incident gets the point across.", "NTA and tbh I\u2019d break up over this. My ex constantly made us late and it\u2019s beyond rude and embarrassing.", "NoNoNo, NTA! Chronically late people, fuck them. To them, your time has no value.", "NTA\u2026you gave a warning\u2026 you left when you told them you would so if THEY weren\u2019t ready and they are over 16 and they had a car that could be used\u2026how are you the AH for keeping your word??? Sooooo NTA", "ESH", "NTA I think that was a good solution, driving separately. Nobody had to drastically change their personalities.", "Fashionably late is not an actual thing.  It's something people made up to explain why their time is more important than everyone else's.\n\nThat said, people who are routinely 15 minutes late are irritating.  People who are two hours late night as well have stayed home.  NTA", "They have repeatedly shown you that they do not respect you or the hosts of the events.  Stop planning to drive there with them.  If you are invited to the same event, make your own transportation plans and enjoy their company when and if they arrive at the party.  kt", "especially with plans at 9 am the next day. with a two hour drive, that means leaving midnight at the latest to still get a moderate amount of sleep. arriving any later than the party starts, will make the round trip longer than the damn party!\n\nalthough, i am sure OP's partner was not going to be ready in time for the 9 am either.", "Their partner probably just goes by she/they pronouns and op rotates between them.

One of my besties we\u2019ve known each other since middle school, just like you said SO LATE to everything, dense as can be about it, doesn\u2019t seem to care. Over the years she\u2019s gotten better kinda ? (Was 1 hour late to a mutual friends party that was only booked for 2 hours long just this past weekend) but now I show up late to everything with her because I just don\u2019t have the time to eff around anymore like that. \n\nIt\u2019s kinda like, well she doesn\u2019t care about making others wait, so I guess she shouldn\u2019t care about waiting because in her mind, waiting for others must be no big deal.", "A North American friend of mine married a man from another culture where they routinely come hours late to things.  My friend learned to deal with this for her child's baby shower by renting a venue, so when her husband's grandmother showed up when everyone was leaving, she could point to the booking time and not have to deal with it.", "I realised I had to change when I turned up on time and my friend wasn\u2019t there - she\u2019d learned I was always 30 minutes late.
