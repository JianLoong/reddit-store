To me it\u2019s frustrating as hell.\n\nI don\u2019t like being late. One it\u2019s disrespectful to the hosts of the event. Two it makes us look like children who cannot manage time properly. Three being late incentives us to drive fast and not drive safely. Four it draws unnecessary attention to us that detracts from whatever\u2019s going on the event. Five we may miss out because we\u2019re late. And those are just the things that I can think of off the top of my head. We should be 15 minutes early to every event she attend. I\u2019ve explained this to them multiple times and they insist I\u2019m catastrophizing lateness and we can be \u201cfashionably late\u201d.\n\nWe planned on going to three Mardi Gras balls this season and the first two we were late by hours. The last one we had to drive two hours to get to the venue and the ball started at 8 so to have even a chance to make it, account for traffic we needed to leave at 5:30 at latest, and still probably would\u2019ve been late. We also had plans that next morning at 9 so I didn\u2019t want to be there all night long. So we could rest before the morning.\n\nSo I told them that I was leaving at 5:30. At that time I would be walking out the door. They have a car, so if I left without them, they could make it there on their own. I was in no way just leaving her there with no way to get to the venue. I guess she thought I was bluffing as they didn\u2019t even get into the shower till 5 was in for 20 minutes. So if she wanted to ride with me, she\u2019d have 10 minutes for hair, dressing and makeup.\n\nAt 5:30 they was not ready and I was so I left. I went to the venue and she never showed up I texted them a few times and she never answered. I checked the Find My Friends thing to make sure they was okay and they were home.I got back home at 2 and they was very upset with me. They said I was an unbelievable asshole for not waiting and that if I didn\u2019t want to wait on them, that they just won\u2019t go. I explained that we had to be there on time and that I\u2019m not wrong for not wanting to be there multiple hours late.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677159022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119xqzu/aita_for_not_taking_my_partner_to_a_mardi_gras/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You made It clear multiple times before. It's not like you walked out without explanation.", "NTA\n\nYou gave them the time line to ride with you and they didn't prioritize it, so they made their choice.", "NTA. Being late with no genuine excuse is rude. Next time, don\u2019t even bother inviting them but go solo or with a more reliable friend.\n\nThis is your future is you stay together without setting boundaries, though. You\u2019re either late or they\u2019ll sulk and refuse to go, punishing you for their failures", "No, you are not the a-hole.  You set expectations for this specific event, should she be late, and you followed through.\n\nHowever, you will be the a-hole if you continue to stay in this relationship.  This woman will not change, and you do not share their views on being late.  There will come a time . . . perhaps your own wedding . . . where you will have an epiphany that you are not compatible and then realize that you wasted years on a relationship that had no happy future.\n\nSome things are an automatic deal-breaker . . . abuse, cheating, chronic lying, etc.\n\nHowever, some things, such as chronic lateness, in and of themselves do not sound like deal-breakers, but the cascading effects, over time, become that.  \n\nGet out before you invest too much time in this person that will NEVER change.", "NTA\n\nShe's being very inconsiderate. Fashionably late is 15 min, not 3 hours. That's just rude.", "Are you married? Is it a long time partner? I don\u2019t understand people who have no respect for others and making someone late and assuming it is absolutely fine to do so is wrong and rude.\n\nI used to leave my sister all the time because she wasn\u2019t ready. I did it 5 times u til she learned to respect my time and now she\u2019s ready when we are going somewhere. She was angry the first 3 times but I didn\u2019t care. \n\nYou have to do the same with your partner. Don\u2019t do it just once. Do it few times for few different occasions if she\u2019s making you late. Beforehand I would record the conversation where you tell her that you are going to go on your own if she\u2019s running late and make sure you record when she says she gets it and understand it. That way she will never be able to tell you she didn\u2019t know you were going to do that or some other BS.\n\nNTA 100%", "NTA.  She knew this was a thing you were concerned about after being told many times.  She also knew what time OP was leaving.  Sounds like she found out and experienced the appropriate consequences.", "2 hours late is not \"fashionably late\", it's \"why bother even going at this point\" late. Seriously, you have to WORK to be that late to something. Your partner is incredibly thoughtless and you did the right thing by giving them a boundary and then leaving when they ignored it. I applaud you for that. Hold firm and from now on your partner will either 1. fix their attitude and join you for future events or 2. continue to miss out. NTA", "Not an ass hole *at all*. You went to the event, on time. Your partner *could have* gotten to the event, on time, *too*, if they could have been bothered. \n\nIf they didn\u2019t show up? That has nothing to do with you. You aren\u2019t their handler or parent, their little legs aren\u2019t broken, (as my daddy used to say), they had transportation. If they are blaming you, please see it as the misplaced crap that it is. \n\nNTA and I hope you had a wonderful time.", "NTA - had the same problem and my therapist told me we are both adults and both have means of getting there and to just go without them and after a time or two it will stop.  She has to be responsible.", "You are NTA. I've broken up friendships with people like this, so kudos to you for marrying one. How did you manage to get to your wedding on time? \n\nThe only way your partner/wife is going to stop being chronically late is if she learns that there are [consequences for her behavior](https://globalnews.ca/news/6066809/why-people-are-late/). I've seen other articles describe this as a tendency towards optimism in scheduling, or a tendency to over schedule a particular time, or even a form of [self-sabotage](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/01/surprising-psychology-behind-being-perpetually-late). I've had to adopt similar tactics to deal with my own partner.", "NTA other than almost giving me a stroke with these pronouns", "NTA - you spelled out the situation very clearly, you gave them plenty of advance warning, they chose not to believe you and paid the consequences\n\nLike you I am not a fan of being late, and it bugs me when people are so irresponsible about timekeeping. Good on you for sticking to your guns", "NTA\n\nMy husband has always made it very clear he will leave if I\u2019m not ready & he does. We have been married 31 years & I have had to drive myself multiple times because I am one of those perpetually late people (never more than 30 min) I know it makes people around me crazy. I\u2019m forever apologizing but I still suck at planning my time properly. I always think I have time to do 1 more thing before I leave. It never works out.", "NTA. You are dating an inconsiderate asshole who has never suffered consequences for her actions. You set a boundary and stuck with it. People like her hate this because it proves that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around around them.", "NTA.\n\nYou said when you were leaving well in advance. There is no such thing as \"fashionably late\", it's actually being an AH to be 2 hours late.", "NTA\n\nI have a family member who is exactly like her. Some people just never learn. Stop offering to take her places immediately.", "NTA \n\nMy dad is like this. He gets into the shower at the time he's supposed to be at my house for whatever planned holiday dinner we're having. Or he'd just be starting the dish he's going to bring at the time he's supposed to arrive (they live 30 minutes away). I started purposely telling him it started 2 hours prior to the actual start and he started showing up on time. Since then I've just stopped hosting because I'm tired of the bs.", "NTA. I'm married to a woman who has no sense of time. I definitely have to work to make sure we're not catastrophically late to everything. HOWEVER, she's aware that she has trouble with time. She knows she needs my help to get there, and she (usually) listens to my warnings about time. It sounds like your partner is not taking you seriously at all. You need to have a serious conversation about what's behind this. Why is she insisting on making you late, when she knows that this is important to you? If the best she can do is that it's not important to be on time, that's not good enough - because it's important to you, and if she cares about you, that should mean something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He couldn\u2019t take it anymore.", "NTA, you didn't need 5 seperate reasons to justify not being late, just saying you like to be on time would be enough. \n\nI'd try sitting down with your partner explaining to them that you don't like being late for things. Obviously things can come up, unexpected traffic, accident etc but consistently being late won't work for you. If they don't change and this is a deal breaker for you maybe consider moving on.\n\nMy ex wife, we were together for better part of a decade and she was always late for things. She'd wake up a couple hours before work, sit on her phone until 30 minutes before to start getting ready, she wouldn't have enough time to get ready and would end up being late, and of course stop on the way for coffee. When it came to us doing things same thing never failed always late, due to poor time management. I told her get up get ready then if it's not time to leave, then sit on your phone. Needless to say nothing changed, we have a child together and have been separated almost 6 years, and still nothing has changed. She is still late for everything, and makes my daughter late for her soccer games or swimming lessons or even school. \n\nHopefully if you truly love your gf, shell realize the issue and work to correct it.", "This sounds like a very frustrating and hurtful relationship for both of you.\n\nNTA -you set expectations and she failed to meet them. It sounds like she won\u2019t be changing, and as your expectations are not unrealistic\u2026that\u2019s a problem.", "INFO: I'm sympathetic to you overall, as having a habitually late partner is incredibly annoying, but a Mardi Gras ball sounds like something that would be looser, with people arriving \"fashionably late\" and coming and going throughout the night. Is it actually something more structured with timed activities?", "NTA - you have expressed your feelings are being (extremely) late numerous times.  They feel that it is acceptable and probably wants to make a dramatic entrance - okay I\u2019m here now it\u2019s really a party now.\n\nThey are being extremely rude not only to you but also the hosts\n\nThey need to grow up and learn how to manage their time better.", "Nta nope, this is exactly what you should do.  They know what time you're leaving.  If they aren't ready it's up to them to get there.", "Nta because its annoying waiting for people to get ready but in her defense most mardi gras balls ive had anything to do with start at like 8, go till like 3 in the morning and probably reach peak occupancy around midnight, so I dont think your situation is particularly unique and there's no dubloon for being the first one through the door", "NTA. I hate being late for anything; I think it is rude and disrespectful. Your girlfriend is entitled, disrespectful and childish - I'm sure you could do better!!"]}
