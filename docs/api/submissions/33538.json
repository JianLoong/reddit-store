Does she have a history of this?\n\nLet's go the route and say it was an accident. So you told her when she came in and she swore to secrecy. You and your family had time to talk for awhile and we're about to eat. Based on my own family I'll say that it took about an hour or so. Then right before everyone eats she STANDS UP and tells your secret. I'm supposed to believe that she was stewing for an hour and then suddenly just blurted it out? \n\nLet's say it's not an accident. You whisper it to her and she swears to keep it a secret. She waits until everyone sits down for dinner and then suddenly stands up so everyone looks at her. She tells your secret. \n\nNone of us know her like you do so only you can decide which option is most likely to be true. I don't think you're TA for your reaction. Regardless of it being an accident or not that was a bad choice she made. \n\nIf you are planning on reaching out to her I would write her something like \"Hey sis. I want you to know that I'm deeply hurt. I told you this in secret because this was a special moment for me and I wanted you to enjoy it with me. I had a plan on how to tell the family at dinner and I was very excited to do it. I understand you may have been excited because I was excited as well.

If you were early on and not planning on saying until 12 weeks then she definitely spoke too soon and I'd have been really upset. \n\nHowever, I don't think it came from a bad place from her pov. Maybe she foolishly blurted out and could have said \"she has  some news for us\" to announce you, rather than your news. \nYou probably allowed your anger to partially ruin the moment too. You wasted the small amount of 'other people being excited for you' by shouting at your sister instead of answering questions and enjoying the moment.
