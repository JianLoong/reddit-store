Does she have a history of this?\n\nLet's go the route and say it was an accident. So you told her when she came in and she swore to secrecy. You and your family had time to talk for awhile and we're about to eat. Based on my own family I'll say that it took about an hour or so. Then right before everyone eats she STANDS UP and tells your secret. I'm supposed to believe that she was stewing for an hour and then suddenly just blurted it out? \n\nLet's say it's not an accident. You whisper it to her and she swears to keep it a secret. She waits until everyone sits down for dinner and then suddenly stands up so everyone looks at her. She tells your secret. \n\nNone of us know her like you do so only you can decide which option is most likely to be true. I don't think you're TA for your reaction. Regardless of it being an accident or not that was a bad choice she made. \n\nIf you are planning on reaching out to her I would write her something like \"Hey sis. I want you to know that I'm deeply hurt. I told you this in secret because this was a special moment for me and I wanted you to enjoy it with me. I had a plan on how to tell the family at dinner and I was very excited to do it. I understand you may have been excited because I was excited as well.

If you were early on and not planning on saying until 12 weeks then she definitely spoke too soon and I'd have been really upset. \n\nHowever, I don't think it came from a bad place from her pov. Maybe she foolishly blurted out and could have said \"she has  some news for us\" to announce you, rather than your news. \nYou probably allowed your anger to partially ruin the moment too. You wasted the small amount of 'other people being excited for you' by shouting at your sister instead of answering questions and enjoying the moment.

OP should take as much time as she needs and hearing an apology and accepting it are two different steps. I\u2019m a strong proponent of \u201cI have heard you, I appreciate this apology, but I need more time/space to move passed this. I hope you understand.\u201d", "Seriously. I'm surprised there aren't more comments saying that. \nFor instance: \"I knew I was thankful that Amy didn't tell anyone yet.\"\nAnd \"Our family talked for a while about internet and then we sat down to eat.\"\nHonestly I that whole paragraph is really awkward.", "Yep, it's either chatgpt or someone whose first language isn't English. Pretty fishy for a thanksgiving story.", "My first thought after reading was did AI write this?  It's so weirdly written and just doesn't really make sense.   Like the description of the \"tradition\", how can that be a thing when OP is apparently the oldest?   And like you say the flow and sentencing is all off.", "What gets me is obviously sister has impulse control issues......this wasn't the first time she exhibited this behavior I'm sure.....OP is close with her sister but never realized this?  And she's the only person OP tells preemptively before dinner?  For what reason?  My senses are tingling.", "Some (many) people just can't tell a story well to save their life. So many people, OP is one with loose ends like that.", "Just curious, what is chatgpt? Older person here, lol.", "That's exactly what I thought.", "Oh yes you\u2019re right, she must have used a fake name to start with, then accidentally used real name at the end.", "You need to learn how to read.

Obviously the sister shouldn't have done that but you know what would have stopped that? OP not telling her to begin with.\n\n OP ruined dinner. The sister just upset OP.", "And yet here are our comments at the bottom.\n\nTotally agree with your summary. ESH.\n\nAmy ruined OP\u2019s \u2018perfect\u2019 moment.

I'm not seeing how that could be a typo \ud83d\ude05 what word was it supposed to be?", "agree", "I thought this was possible too.", "Anything over 13 is too old for \"oopsie, I just HAD to shout it out to the whole room because I'm excited\".", "She was mature enough to handle it though. She knew before Thanksgiving and even if OP only told her the day before, though it doesn't sound like she only knew for 24 hours, she kept her mouth shut during all the mingling that was surely occurring before the meal too.", "Lmao yes \u201ctalked about internet\u201d got me!", "I had to scroll too far down to find someone to laugh about that sentence with.

So, who knows.", "[Chatgpt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) is an AI program for chatting and \u201cwriting\u201d texts. It\u2019s based on millions of existing books, research papers, chat logs and such, written by real humans. The AI program is pretty good and gets better really quickly but so far it writes stuff like this post, where something just feels wrong. Pretty soon we won\u2019t be able to tell the difference though, it\u2019s developing super fast. Kind of scary.", "Yeah, AITA does love to jump on the first mistake sometimes and write off what happens after. \n\nEveryone jumping on 'Your house your rules.' Yes but it's a regular family party not your pregnancy announcement party. The rules of who hosts now mean OP probably won't get to again. If the party ever goes back to being the same now there's an apparently impassable rift. Which sister gets invited?\n\nIf OP really wants revenge the best way is to laugh it off while making the point that it happened then make it a  running joke that Amy can't keep her mouth shut. People think you're the bigger person for laughing it off and Amy gets regularly shamed. 'Everyone, I have an announcement. Amy, over to you!' Especially when she has no clue what you plan to say. \n\nNot suggesting it as a way to live but honestly it's way more effective a way to be an asshole than chucking her out and then thinking everyone else will just be normal about that and get back to the party. If you blow your top, you become the story and she gets sympathy.", "Totally, and the fact the question is being asked now, so far after the event, means it's still an issue and we don't have anything of what went after it.

They think they're making a choice that will work out for them.\n\nI would say that it's a crime, it's unethical, and it's a mistake. They've broken the law, caused harm, and are dealing with unwanted negative consequences.\n\nThey thought it would work out for them. They were mistaken.", "Maybe it was supposed to be \"another first\"?
