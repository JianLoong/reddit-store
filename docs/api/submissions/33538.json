Probably not as excited as you but y'all sound like close sisters so I'm going to assume she was very happy and nervous because she was holding a big and happy secret and you CAN in fact lose control to impulsions like that, not sure why people here think you don't but you actually can (not everything is in bad faith ppl) and yta as well because you ruined thanksgiving by reacting like that, YES it was your moment but acting like that and then kicking her out? That's just ah behavior", "NTA", "INFO: Who is Sam?\n\nNTA. This doesn't sound like an accident. This sounds like Amy wanted to be the center of attention. I would never tell her any important stuff of your live again. At least nothing that hasn't been already known by everyone in the family.", "A lot of people are saying ESH but personally I think you\u2019re NTA. If I were pregnant and someone shouted out MY big news and claimed to be an accident, I\u2019d react the same way.", "Congrats on the pregnancy. Unfortunately, ESH here. Amy is partly to blame for spurting out your news, but **you** ruined Thanksgiving dinner and put a damper on what should have been a joyous announcement by throwing a tantrum. Yeah, Amy overstepped by **a lot** in her excitement, but you made things much worse by kicking her out. You need to reach out to her.", "ESH, I completely understand she stole your thunder but kicking her out is going too far. You need to tell everyone not to tell anyone or post it so you can at least tell your closest friends. It still sucks, my brother did something similar. I told my family that my wife was pregnant. He instantly went on FB and posted it. I told him to take it down but he wouldn't, said not a big deal. I was pissed as I wanted to tell my closest friends and didn't want them to find out from a FB post. I had to quickly write out a group text to them so they would find out from me and not FB. I was pissed but wouldn't kick him out. I told him last on the 2nd pregnancy.", "NTA, but secret keeping starts with you. Never trust her with a secret again, but move on.", "NTA\n\nShe knows how to keep her mouth shut it wasn\u2019t her place\n\nAnd so what if she\u2019s sorry.  You don\u2019t need to have people in your life who disrespect and disregard what your wishes are", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she\u2019s an older teenager she crossed a boundary. But if she is younger than that, I just wouldn\u2019t have trusted her with the secret. You\u2019re NTA, but I wouldn\u2019t have disclosed it to her period if you had any suspicions that she would say something.\n\nI read this as if she wasn\u2019t an adult. If she\u2019s an adult, she ruined your moment and should be held accountable.", "NTA - that was an incredibly rude and selfish thing to do. I\u2019d kick her out too. Mom, in particular, downplayed it too hard. Allow your sister to apologize if she does and does it sincerely. But no more secrets for Amy. She lost that privilege.", "NTA. Shouting someone's secret out loud after promising to stay quiet isn't something you accidentally do. She did what she did on purpose. Maybe she was really excited and too impatient to wait for you to announce it yourself, but that's no excuse to ruin what should've been your moment.\n\n\"Seriously it isn't a big deal, you can do this again!\" No you can't. It's not like everyone will forget you're pregnant and what are the chances you'll have a fourth kid?\n\nWhy did you tell Amy in the first place, are you two super close?", "ESH. She messed up but you are taking it too far. The only way to stop a secret coming out before you are ready is not to tell anyone so next time I\u2019d just keep what you want secret a secret", "NTA, your house, your rules, she broke her promise. If she\u2019s sincereley sorry though, accept her apology", "NTA, how exactly was this accident? I really dislike when people say when they say something they aren't supposed to is an accident! It's not, it's lack of impulse control. Now you know for next time when you get pregnant not to tell you child of a sister.", "NTA Amy is a liar that broke your trust and a boundary you know things are going to be awkward with your family on Christmas Day", "Considering OP kicked her out and the parents didn't follow, she might be at least 18 and living in her own place.", "Totally fair, didn\u2019t want to assume age. But, sister didn\u2019t sound like she was mature enough to handle something like that either way. Especially if it is an adult blurting out a secret, and to have the rest of the family quick to defend her like it was an \u201caccident.\u201d \nI know it doesn\u2019t make up for it OP, but however you decide to go about sharing the gender/finding out the gender will still be really rewarding and you will still have lots of firsts with the baby."]}
