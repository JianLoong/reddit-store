I moved in with my boyfriend, and after a few months, my parents apologized, but things got worse. I tried to be myself, but they called it sinful. I was hurt that they couldn't accept me and spent nights crying. I wondered why they couldn't just love me for who I am.\n\nMy sister invited me to a party and then surprised me with a coming out party. My parents congratulated her and hugged her, which was hard to see since I'd been rejected by them for a long time. They always said I was sinful and going to hell, so it hurt to see them accept her. I couldn't understand why they were praising her when they've treated me so unfairly in the past. I felt alone and angry, but my sister held my hand and took me into the center of the room, where she revealed that the party was for her coming out.\n\nI couldn't understand how they could reject and abandon me while embracing my sister. It wasn't fair and wasn't right. I felt angry, hurt, and confused. I wanted to scream, cry, and call out my parents for their cruel treatment. As I watched my sister soak up the love and support from her friends and family, my heart broke. I couldn't understand why they had treated me so differently, and it felt like they had cast me out. Finally, I stood up and toasted to my sister's coming out, but the toast also included a big F-you to my parents.\"\n\nthe only thing that I could think of was how much my parents had rejected me and cast me alone. I felt so angry and so hurt \"Thank you to everyone congratulating my sister,\" I said with a glass in my hand \"and also fuck you Mom and Dad\" I stood up and shouted, \"You have no idea how much your rejection has hurt me,\" I yelled, my words spilling out quickly. \"But now you're proud of her for being who she is, but with me, you couldn't even treat me like a person.\" I raised my glass and toasted. \"So I suppose I'll toast to that. and a big f-you to my parents for throwing me out just for being me.\" But at least for tonight, they had to listen to my words and sit with the uncomfortable truth of their actions. I put the glass down, and my heart raced with a mixture of satisfaction and fear. I grabbed my husband's hand, taking in the strength and support he gave me. As we walked out of the door, I waved to my parents and gave them the middle finger. I didn't care that others were watching, I just wanted my parents to know that I was done with them. I felt my husband's hand squeeze mine. a few days later some family texted me saying I should have told my parents alone instead of ruining my sister's big day.

Your sister knew what you went through. She knew they kicked you out and knows how you were treated. This was deliberate. It has to be, nobody is that unaware.", "NTA. Your parents for obvious reasons, and your sister for missing the obvious and completely foreseeable consequence of her getting to celebrate something that caused you serious pain. How could she not see this coming?\n\nIf you knew what was happening beforehand, I don't think you would've gone, and I totally get why you did what you did. I was going to say E S H, but the more I think about it, I can't fault you for what you did.", "NTA. The excuse that she was ten is just an excuse. She\u2019s aware of what you went through - then and now. Because clearly the homophobic comments didn\u2019t end. Time to go NC with them. Also what leg do these other family members stand on? Where were they when you were kicked out? They don\u2019t get an opinion if they looked the other way", "INFO: was your sister around/aware of the issues surrounding your own coming out?\n\nBecause if she was, you're definitely in the right. If she wasn't...screwing up her day by yelling openly rather than just subtly telling your parents to fuck off or immediately leaving was kind of rude. But just a bit, because fuck your parents and they deserve to be publically humiliated", "NTA. If your sister knew about all of this history with you and your parents and decided to surprise you with this being a coming out party, then she's was being incredibly inconsiderate. And it goes without saying that your parents were extremely shitty.", "NTA. \n\nYou handled it like a complete Boss right up to and including the middle finger. They deserved public humiliation and I'm glad that your lovely and supportive husband had your hand and your back. \n\nHold your head up high and enjoy life with your awesome husband! X", "Your parents are horrid and it's parents like that that make it hard for people to be who they are my daughter and son both came out to me and I am as proud of them and happy they could share it with me and my hubby in a safe and loving environment i love them with all my heart and soul and I am just happy they are happy so a big accepting hug from me to you", "I'd say NTA if your sister knew how you were treated in the past. But then again she's quite young, and maybe in her mind it would have made you happy to see how much your parents have changed. I respect the hell out of you telling off your parents in front of everyone though, that was such a bad-ass move! And they deserved it. The family member who texted you is an AH, what kind of psychopath blames someone who was kicked out at 16 for being gay over the parents who abandoned and emotionally abused their child? If anyone ruined the party it was your parents for never properly apologizing to you, if they have actually changed this much.", "NTA. It's the consequences of their own behavior. They had a ton of time to apologize properly, make up and regret their actions. They didn't. So of course you'd feel the way you did when your sibling got unconditional love and support. You may have given them an actual middle finger, but they've been giving you one for a while now and an especially huge one via this party. Hopefully they realize their mistakes and properly make amends without any excuses, although it's not likely.", "NTA", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To be very clear, only for your sister and the drama at her party.  I do wholeheartedly understand however, the feelings and I would not condemn you for speaking up as you did in that setting - I'd have probably done the same.  You are right, the double standard your parents display in accepting your sister for the same thing they lambasted you for... big hugs OP, I'm sorry you had to go through that.  I hope you patch things up with your sister and she can provide the familial support and love you deserve, I daresay she could use some support for you too - remember: your parents' actions are not hers.", "YTA. I say this with all the love possible, but your sister didn\u2019t deserve that. She\u2019s so much younger than you and probably had no idea about how you felt when you came out.   To be clear, you absolutely deserved a chance to tell off your parents. But you have so much unresolved stuff with them, it spilled into your sister\u2019s party. Don\u2019t you want them to treat her better than they did to you?  Don\u2019t you want her to be supported and accepted for who she is? Of course you do. Your parents have come a long way but that doesn\u2019t mean it erases what they did to you.", "YTA your sister was 10 when you came out, a child who couldn't possibly understand the impact that had on you and we don't even know if she knew the whole story. I know it hurt to see but by taking your anger out on your parents on a day meant to celebrate your sister instead of in private is an AH move and you ruined her coming out by making it about you. Your parents deserved it but your sister and the friends there to support her did not. Your family is right, this was a conversation to have alone and if it made you upset then you had every opportunity to leave instead of blowing up and making a scene. Just because you unfortunately did not receive the same warm welcome doesn't mean your sister is any less deserving.", "YTA. Yes, your parents were massive A Hs for how they treated you. They deserve your anger. But nowhere in your post does it say that your *sister* did anything wrong in regards to you. Vent your righteous anger at your parents, absolutely. But you should not have done it in a way that ruined your sister\u2019s party.", "ESH - but sister must be blind if she didn\u2019t see how they treated you compared to her. She must\u2019ve known you have been rejected since adulthood for coming out, but did she think that her parents response to her announcement would make you happy? That\u2019s teenagers for you, it\u2019s all about them.", "YTA.  \nnot everything is about you. Yes, you got rejected by your parents who clearly loves your sister more. then again, its her time now, so why being a drama queen and ruin it for her?\n\nBe happy that you are not alone, and forget those who don't care about you and your happiness\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat being said, let me explain something about religious people (Jewish and Christians): The bible only refers to Male intercourse as a sin. Stupid, right? My religious wife's family, accepted her gay sister with all their heart, yet they are rejecting gay men in general.\n\ndon't try to understand religion and faith", "[removed]", "And what about the parents? They\u2019ve had *YEARS* to reflect, change, and apologize for their abhorrent behavior. I feel so bad for OP", "She was 10 when he came out, its possible that she doesn't know how bad it was for him", "oh no, her party!!!!!! \n\nThe coming out party where she made her brother watch as the people who rejected him for the very same thing were now celebrating her! How could he ruin that party!", "Good points BUT he didn't have time to think this through. He was blindsided and in shock and pain. I get the feeling if he knew what the party was about, he'd either not go or be able to contain himself. I think the shock and severity of the moment is enough to give him a pass here.", "It would be very petty of the sister to let this ruin their relationship forever. Seems unlikely to me.", "I think that's a tad harsh.  Yes - for his sister, YTA somewhat... but she did blindside him and it is something clearly traumatic for him.  Put in the same situation, I think I would have done the same.", "She was 10 when he came out. We have zero context since he moved in with his boyfriend about how much she knew or was told. She was a child and this is 11 years later. I feel like y'all are not understanding that context.", "I absolutely feel for him 100%. He has so many emotions about what his parents did, I\u2019m certain they all came spilling out. I\u2019d give him a pass but he needs to mend things with his sis.", "She was 10 when her 16yo brother left the family home because his parents rejected him. \n\nShe knows.", "She\u2019s not 10 now. She\u2019s old enough to consider her brother\u2019s feelings.", "Exactly she was ten and Not a toddler.\n\nShe is as evil as her Parents"]}
