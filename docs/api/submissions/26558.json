Example: they were going to an amusement park, while my sister and I stayed with a babysitter. My brother was also a spoiled brat because of this, things changed when Sam started high school. From what I know, a teacher realized the situation, and when talking to our parents didn't work, she talked to Sam and well, I don't know what she told him, but Sam seemed to be more aware of things, and he started to change. gradually. It got better, he apologized to me and Lili, and refused to do anything if our parents didn't treat us fairly.\r  \nCurrently, all three of us have limited contact with our parents. I'm fine with Sam, I've forgiven him for his behavior a long time ago, but not Lili. She never wants him close, she is cold and never goes to events where Sam is present, except family ones.\r  \nLili got married 3 weeks ago, she invited Sam, and he brought his wife, Kate (30). She has fertility problems.\r  \nThe wedding was wonderful. And then came the reception.\r  \nWhen everyone finished the first meal, I saw Kate coming out, and half an hour later Sam did too. I was worried, and decided to go see if everything was okay. I found them in the bathrooms with someone who worked there. Kate looked terrible, I don't think I've ever seen someone so sick, and Sam was very worried. In the end they had to leave. Now the place was small, so it's not impossible that someone saw us take Kate to the car, since when I returned several people asked me if everything was okay. I told them that Kate had vomited and that she really felt bad, so they decided to leave early.\r  \nAt one point, Lili's SIL joked saying something like \"Oh, it would be funny if they said she was pregnant.\" But a cousin clarified that Kate had infertility problems, so the conversation turned to the difficulties of having children and how they hoped that this would be Kate's \"miracle.\" Me and the other bridesmaids tried to divert the topic, but my sister was obviously angry.\r  \nThis morning, I woke up and saw a post from my brother and Kate, announcing the pregnancy. I am very happy for them. Lili is furious. She called me to complain, in short, that \"he once again stole an important moment from her life and still has the nerve to announce his baby.\" She said many more things that I won't repeat because they really seem horrible to me. In the end I got fed up, and I told her directly to grow up, that what happened wasn't Sam's or Kate's fault. There is no way they planned the pregnancy for this time and she should be ashamed for reacting like that.

Your brother and his wife waited 3 weeks after the wedding to announce their pregnancy, right? They are not stealing anything from your sister, they waited a good amount of time post-wedding to make the announcement. To be honest, I think that anything your brother and SIL do will piss off your sister because of her childhood, but that's your sister's problem and no one should have to walk on eggshells around her.", "She was throwing up in the toilet, and they *DIDN'T* announce the pregnancy? NTA. I definitely sympathize with Lili because she clearly has a lot of trauma (and I do not use the word trauma lightly), but she's taking it out on innocent parties instead of working through said trauma with a mental health professional.\n\nETA the baby was announced THREE WEEKS after the wedding. Ask lili if she expected them to have the baby in secret LMAO", "NTA-and I don\u2019t really think that what you said to her is \u201cchoosing sides\u201d. It counts more until the heading of \u201cproviding perspective/clarity\u201d. Lil will hopefully come around in her due time.", "the only asshole here is your sis (understandably so given her upbringing) who seems to have forgotten that sam being the golden child wasn't his fault; it was your shitty parents fault for playing favorites.  She needs to work with a professional to overcome the blame she's put on sam that rightfully belongs to your parents.  Congrats on your future nephew/niece!", "The poor woman was throwing up in the toilet, so it wasn't her fault she was feeling sick. They didn't make a scene and left discreetly, it's not their fault that the conversation focused on them.\n\nSam has the right to announce the arrival of his baby. It's not all about Lili, it's been 3 weeks since her wedding and everybody's moved on.\n\nNTA", "Growing up with parents who favours their son so blatantly and on top of that she was THE twin is tough. Not everyone is as forgiving as you are. At this point the resentment she harbours is clear and ur stand wouldn't have changed anything.\n\n\n You and your brother were absolutely not the assholes but I doubt Lily will ever understand that.( I mean she is pregnant...how is announcing that their fault) .She just need help from a professional irrespective of whether she wants to have a relation with her twin or not in the future.\nNTA.   NTA.", "NTA they wait for 3 weeks before make post . It not sam fault that your parents treat him better than others siblings lili get mad at wrong people", "NTA. Sam and Kate didn\u2019t do anything wrong here, just quietly left the wedding because Kate was unwell. The only pregnancy talk on the day came from other people, *after* they\u2019d left. They didn\u2019t even announce the pregnancy until three weeks later. Lili is overreacting, and also failing to recognise that Sam\u2019s preferential treatment as a child *wasn\u2019t his fault.* In fact, he managed to course-correct as a teenager, apologising to you and your sister, and pushing back when your parents were being unfair. That\u2019s pretty freaking impressive, frankly. Lili is well within her rights to still feel strongly about her childhood, but it\u2019s not Sam who should be the target of her anger. Sam didn\u2019t ruin her big day - Lili ruined it herself.", "NTA. Your sister is a brat. She's mad at Sam for bs that happened as a kid that wasn't entirely his fault that he worked to correct. She cant get over it and she's being childish. Why did she even invite him to the wedding?", "NTA. Lili needs to get over it. Your brother made amends for something that wasn't even his fault 12 Years Ago! Anything he did was when he was a child. You're right, Lili needs to grow up.", "NTA that being said I do feel like they could have waited until a bit further out from your sisters wedding to announce it. Given your brother knows how she has felt in the past your sister probably feels like her wedding photos and such have been overshadowed by their quick announcement of the baby\n\nedit: didn't see the \"three weeks ago\" part, yeah NTA majorly, she's got to get over that shit eventually, what were they supposed to do? wait until it was born?", "NTA.\n\nWhy do some bride\u2019s think that everyone has to put their lives on hold for their wedding day? \n\nYour brother and his wife did nothing wrong and shame on your sister for making their good news all about her.", "NTA- Nobody really plans on throwing up at the wedding and being the center of attraction. If your brother really has made amends, then Lilli should not have had an issue.", "NTA", "So they should keep the pregnancy a secret? For how long? How long AFTER a wedding does the spotlight have to stay on her? What a ridiculous concept.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThey didn't announce it at the wedding, they waited until after to be respectful.  Your sister needs to let go or just go NC and be done with it.", "NTA. \n\nSam and Kate have hit the AITA trifecta - Sam apologised and made amends for the GC behaviour, they were discreet about Kate's illness at the reception and left quietly instead of making a scene, and waited a further 3 weeks before announcing their pregnancy. Literally all the things this sub declares non-AHs should be doing in those situations. \n\nThat grandkid is going to be the centre of attention for a while, just by dint of being first baby, a 'miracle' baby, and the GC's baby. If Lili can't get over herself, she's gonna say something horrible and get completely ostracised, and she'll probably deserve it. Venting to her sis, who understands the history, is one thing, completely blowing up (over something that was not a deliberate slight to her) is another.", "NTA\n\nLili needs to let the bitterness go, it\u2019s poisoning her life and relationships.", "As a twin, did Lili ever get a childhood birthday celebrated? Do you remember your birthday celebrations from being only child for 8 years? Did your parents continue celebrating your birthday, your graduation, etc after Sam was born, because your birthday was on a different day, your graduation years before his? \n\nSounds like as a twin, Lili's childhood from birth was spending every birthday, every graduation, witnessing how much love her parents were capable of. While knowing they'd prefer if she didn't exist. Her brother didn't start changing until they were approaching adulthood. Do you both understand why that's far to late to reverse the severe emotional damage? You're 8 years older. The preferential treatment wouldn't have been so devastating for you because you have memories from before Sam and Lili were born. You still got your own events. Lili has never got one.\n\nSam knew Kate was suffering horrendous pregnancy sickness. That didn't coincidentally start at the wedding. Why didn't Sam attend without Kate? Say she home sick? YTA for dismissing Lili's valid pain. I would stop trying to force Lili to have Sam in her life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
