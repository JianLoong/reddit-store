That exception was a school counselor who called me Mrs. Ex-husband's Name for years, until I complained to a (female) vice-principal that his misidentifying me repeatedly despite correction and countless email signatures & voice mails from me using my correct name was a microaggression symptomatic of the cultural sexism in the school. She must have said something to him, because it stopped. Suddenly, I was Ms. My Name.\n\n\nThat is what you have with your MIL, an on-going microaggression. Personally, I believe names have power and this is a hill worth dying on. My own (ex) MIL sent me monogrammed towels as though I had taken her son's last name, even though she knew I hadn't. I sent them back to her (through him) with a note saying \"there must have been a mix up, as I received these lovely towels, but they are monogrammed for someone else. I am sure their intended recipient will love them, what a thoughtful idea, I will have to get some myself!\" She didn't press the issue again.

She needs to respect your identity if she wants a relationship with you that's built on respect. I'll tell you how women in my family have handled it. \n\nMy mom and aunts were young in the 70s when keeping your name (or using it for a middle name) was first becoming more popular. Back then it had usually only been women with professional degrees who would do that. She solved the problem by returning mail to sender with a note that no such person lived at this address. She would send along a second card explaining, \"I believe you've made an oops with your address book. Mrs. Dad's Last Name, my mother in law,  lives at 123 MIL Lane. The residents of 456 DIL Drive are Dad's Full Name and Mom's Full Name. While I'm happy to forward MILs mail to her, I believe it'd be quickest to mail her directly.\" Works double hard if you're slightly sweet about it and send something like   cookies along with it. You've kindly told them off and almost bribed them to go along. If they keep sending you Mrs DH mail then you just keep returning it or forwarding it to whomever has the name of Mrs His Last Name. It will work but you have to be consistent. This is a power play, but MILs are older and usually out of practice when it comes to wrangling toddlers and preteens. If she wants to behave like an obstinate little girl, you can totally handle that! It hasn't been too long since you were an obstinate teen yourself and so you've still got more skills left over.\n\nETA. Some older generations of women have a hard time understanding what the issue is. You can see that from the comments here. I'm not a Mrs., but I am a Ms. in certain circumstances. I know something about making older women use the correct title. I've found that very often these types of older ladies are mainly looking for reassurance that you're not judging *their* choice to be a Mrs. WhatsHisName.

False equivalence. presumably made to imply OP is seeking a double standard because his wearing a ring is the same as her using her professional name that is associated with her career just as he will continue to do after marriage (also simply wanting to keep one\u2019s name for any other reason not related to career is reason enough). She doesn\u2019t need to get consensus from relatives or figure out as a couple whether she\u2019ll actually be called by her own name by others (to name change or not should be discussed before marriage and if he doesn\u2019t agree they can not get married but they did they and her husband has no issue with it)\n\nThe actual equivalent situation is whether men should be called Mr Herfirstnamr Herlastname because they are married and he made that choice and should not ruffle feathers because he knew what he was getting into.

It seems like they can be compared, you just don\u2019t want to. \n\nPlus typically jokes aren\u2019t clear communication, but they also clearly communicated with the MIL as well by letting her know that she doesn\u2019t go by Mrs. Husband\u2019d Last Name and that she kept her Maiden name. How is that not clear? Plus the MIL then decided to ignore/ghost them and not reply back.

I took my husband's last name, and my husband also took my last name...\n\nbut my dear Grandmother insisted on addressing all cards to me, to Mrs Husband's First and Last Name.\n\nIt was silly...  but I knew in her mind, she was doing it because she thought I would enjoy receiving mail that acknowledged my big life milestone!  I'm sure she imagined me smiling as I saw how the card was addressed, reveling in my love for my new husband and everything that meant...  feeling \"grown-up\", etc.\n\nWe were married for 10+ years before my grandmother died and I never said a thing to her, because what is the point of making her feel like she made a social faux pas when I knew she was just thinking about how SHE felt when she first got married, and got to receive mail address to her new name?\n\nI suspect OP feels otherwise disrespected by her MIL and is holding onto the name issue as just one example...  if OP felt like her MIL loved and respected her, and was doing this out of an over-abundance of enthusiasm to claim OP as part of her family, I suspect OP wouldn't mind.  But if I'm right about this, OP should forget the name thing, and talk to her husband about the more substantial things the MIL is doing to make OP feel disrespected.

And there's nothing wrong with you choosing to change your last name, just like there's nothing wrong with women choosing to keep theirs. Again- it's typically about not having to change one's identity, that they've had for their whole life, and not always about the patriarchy or whatever else. It doesn't matter that it's \"someone else's name-\" that's not the point. Nearly everyone's name is \"someone else's name.\" But the individual combination of names that each of us have is our identity. And some people don't want to change that identity when they marry. Some men choose to take their wife's last name, too- and that's okay.\n\nAt the end of the day, people have their reasons for their choices. And when others disrespect those choices when they have absolutely no effect on them whatsoever, it's wrong. It would be just as wrong for me to refer to you using your maiden name as it is when others deliberately refer to my wife using my last name."]}
