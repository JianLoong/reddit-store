I (male) had experience on shaving and cutting hair since i used to help in a barbershop to have some sort of personal income. I was ready and even said hello to my old mentor to practice a little beforehand. when the day came my father took me aside and told me that my mom will be recording and that i was supposed to shave my head as well, i immediately refused and said i was only asked to shave her hair and nothing more. My parents started scolding me and what not, my dad threatened that HE\u2019d just shave my hair if i wasn\u2019t going to. even tho i didn\u2019t want to i followed orders. i couldn\u2019t help but smile when she cried while hugging me.. sadly my hair was all i could think about after that. I guess im still a bit salty and i tell myself that it\u2019s just hair but i still haven\u2019t talked to my dad for about 3 days now after i shaved my cousin\u2019s hair.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689806176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15498zw/aita_for_refusing_to_shave_my_head_to_comfort_my/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019re parents are being weird and sound like they only want you to do it for these sweet sweet Facebook likes.", "NTA it's a nice thing to do, but forcing someone to do it isn't ok. Were your parents getting their heads shaved?", "If someone wants to shave their hair, it should 100% be up to the person shaving their head. Having been on the receiving end of treatment, seeing people shave their head for clout and likes is annoying. In fact, it sometimes feels straight up disrespectful to the one's going through the struggle of radiation/chemo. \n\nPeople can be supportive other than just shaving their head. Be there to sit in silence when they don't feel like talking. Bring them something that you know will put a smile on their face. Come up with a plethora of corny jokes to laugh at- laughter is the best medicine after all. \n\nNTA", "I would have said no. It sounds like they wanted you to do it specifically for the video which is a little bit gross", "NTA you did something nice by offering to cut your cousins hair at home and your parents (and probably your aunt & uncle) decided that you should cut your hair to make her feel a bit better about losing her hair - wow personaly I would sneak up on dad with clippers when he is sitting in a chair relaxing and take a big chunk out of his hair and tell him how he was so hot on making cousin feel better that you thought he should do it too", "NTA and honestly, as someone who has been bald due to cancer, I could not have cared less that someone else was bald. It didn\u2019t help with the pain and nausea chemo caused me. I find it idiotic that OP was forced to shave his head in solidarity, however, against his will. (Please explain how that is in solidarity, though)", "NTA - The sentiment can be nice, but all that is lost when it's forced.  It's your body, your hair, and it should have been your decision.", "NTA but your parents absolutely suck. They wanted credit for you shaving your head. Why didn\u2019t they shave their heads? There is still time. Offer to record it while they shave each other. When they refuse to do it ask them to explain why you had to do it but they don\u2019t. \n\nHow old are you?", "NTA\n\nIt is a personal decision and shouldn\u2019t be forced.", "He forced you into making an action about your body autonomy against your will.  This is not OK. NTA. He turned a moment that should have been co.forting for the entire family for something sour and potentially traumatic for you. Would you ever agree to do anything like that agaim after this? I wouldn't.", "NTA. I kind of get it. The whole solidarity thing, but in a way, it seems a little mean. \"Look, my hair will grow back and yours won't for a long long time!\"", "NTA\n\nIs your dad shaving his head? This feels like they were doing it for views or something.", "NTA. The fact that they requested this is beyond ridiculous- it\u2019s not a show of support if you\u2019ve were coerced into it and resent having to do it. Demanding someone to sacrifice for others removes any meaning the gesture has.", "NTA Shaving someone's hair without consent is considered assualt in America. \n\nThey were definitely doing it for good parent points on the internet. Your parents suck", "They were so adamant about it because they wanted to use the video to go viral.", "NTA- understand if your parents forcibly shave your head that could be considered abuse. I don't know how old you are.  If you're an adult, it can be considered assault.", "NTA, but if my dad said that to me I would buzz his head Jackass style.", "NTA. I don't understand how forcing someone to shave their head helps a cancer patient.  (And your parents recording it seems a bit performative at best.) How does this  casual cruelty help the sick person?", "NTA. OP you have every right to never speak to your father again in my opinion. He\u2019s nothing but a bully and has zero respect for you. \n\nAlso this everyone has to shave their heads in solidarity sh1t because someone has cancer needs to end. If someone wants to do it okay. But shaming, bullying, and forcing people to do it is toxic AF and doesn\u2019t help the cancer patient in any way.", "NTA your father is.  You shaved your hair for NOTHING. You didn\u2019t do it out of love or anything. Your parents forced you for likes on social media.  Don\u2019t talk to your father for long period of time until he shaves his head. Fair is fair.", "NTA. Why didn't your parents shave their heads?", "NTA. Your hair", "NTA. Shaving your hair in solidarity with a cancer patient should not be forced. The fact that they made you do it shows that they only wanted you to do that so that they could brag about it to other people. I wouldn't talk to either one of them again. Yes it just hair but its your hair and you should not have been forced to shave it.", "When did the whole head shaving become a requirement?\n\nIt used to be a kindness to show solidarity for cancer patients..it was never a necessity.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Cancer patient here to say that it wouldn't help me in any way for someone to shave their hair & I would actually be put off by the performative nature of it (not you OP, because you were coerced).  People can provide real help in so many other ways (like OP did by shaving their cousin's head at home) that the fake \"solidarity\" of someone who doesn't have cancer shaving their head is almost offensive.", "NTA. Why did they shave her head? Not all chemotherapy makes your hair fall out. What if she has a Cancer and a treatment that doesn't cause hair loss. Just wait till the doctors tell her that if that's the case she's going to be pretty angry that she shaved her head. But now I would never shave my head cuz someone has cancer I don't don't get the point yes you're showing support but why should everyone have to save their head? You can support them in so many other ways then doing that.\n\nDid your mom and your dad shave their heads? I bet not.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI suppose shaving your head, is some sort of sign of solidarity.\n\nBut, and I say this as someone who had family members die of cancer and lost their hair during treatment, it\u2019s completely unnecessary, is a meaningless gesture and those in my life suffering from the cancer, never asked and expected this.\n\nThey all had better things to worry about than weather other shaved their heads in solidarity.", "I didn\u2019t shave my head during chemo, but if someone had forced me to do it and recorded me at the same time that person would be out of my life. \n\nNTA- you are not the one going through treatment and I find head shaving because someone else has cancer to be quite performative unless it is for a donation or to support a very young child.", "NTA Those videos are always nice to see but I never thought anyone was coerced into doing it.
