It\u2019s always some \u2018well-meaning\u2019 family member who you can bet wouldn\u2019t do it themselves. NTA", "\" my mom will be recording\", that's the exact point we could safely decide \"NTA\".", "NTA. I survived cancer and didn't lose any hair to chemo, so I would have felt bad if anyone I knew shaved their head in support", "NTA. Not the first time I\u2019ve commented on this subject. As a cancer survivor who lost their hair, I give you permission to NEVER shave your head in solidarity (unless you REALLY REALLY want to). I annoys the hell out of me that this has become a thing.", "Your family sucks.  NTA", "You should have told them you will tell your cousin they forced you to lose your hair, and refuse to cut their hair as well unless they stop being assholes.\n\nGetting stubborn is the only way to teach your parents respect for you (since they clearly do not have it)", "It's not \"just hair\". How we wear our hair, style it, how long or short, is part of how we express our personality. Your parents were incredibly abusive by forcing you to shave your hair, and incredibly shallow to force you to do so in a mock-show of solidarity to your cousin. You really should not talk to your dad ever again until he understands what he did to you.", "I lost the hair on the top of my head and also my beard when I was going through chemo. It sucked. I did not expect anyone else to shave their heads and would have felt awful if they did. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \nI would have kicked up a stink, and said it you had to then your parents did too.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have given in. Bullying and threats for the sake of a video? I wouldn\u2019t be speaking to him again.", "That's all the more reason you're right.", "Sounds like you hit a soft spot with that question.", "Exactly! What does it actually accomplish? For me, it was bad enough that I was bald, I didn\u2019t want anyone else to go through that unnecessarily. It was that practical help I needed (and got), not a meaningless gesture."]}
