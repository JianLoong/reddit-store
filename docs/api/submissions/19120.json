And it's so common that people don't understand that disability is often a matter of degree, and not necessarily easily visible.\n\nGood on you for not taking that shit.", "NTA, dont even worry about it. your disability is your own personal thing, you dont owe anyone an explanation as to why you're using/not using a wheelchair at any given moment.", "ESH. It's better to ignore those people. Try not to engage. Your response was unnecessary and brought you down to his level.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nQuit engaging with people like this.  You won't convince them of anything, and clearly you can't handle this kind of conflict without being an asshole in return.", "NTA. The fact that wheelchairs are expensive isn't your problem, there's not a shortage and you're not sitting on a hoard of chairs.\n\nAmbulatory chairs users are valid. Just because you can go from bed to bathroom on your feet doesn't mean it doesn't let you go places you couldn't otherwise.", "NTA. I'm sorry you had an ableist tool like that on your train ride.", "NTA. I just went through something similar, but with family.\n\nDo not feel bad or like an a-hole just because you use mobility devices. You NEED them. Invisible disabilities exist. That guy was being ableist, and using his friend's limited access to mobility devices as an excuse. You do not need to justify your use. He was a jerk to assume AND berate you. Give him no more thought. Do what's best for you and haters like that guy can go gripe elsewhere.", "NTA He was being an ass- even if you had been faking he should have just minded his own business. As you said your finances have nothing to do with his friend.\n\nI think people don\u2019t always realise that using a wheelchair doesn\u2019t automatically mean someone cannot stand or take a few steps. I don\u2019t think I had fully clocked this in my head until my Nan needed one to go out as she could only walk short distances on flat, even surfaces. No way she could have left the house without one. \n\nYou know your body best- do what is best for you. It doesn\u2019t help anyone if you go without your wheelchair today because you\u2019re feeling okay and make yourself unable to walk tomorrow.

That guy was a major jerk and attacked you for no reason.

I'm not friggin' rich either!\"", "Yea, ambulatory wheelchair users are totally a thing. I'd guess a huge chunk (majority) of wheelchair users can move their legs to some degree. \n\nI do understand second guessing yourself, as an ambulatory wheelchair user myself, but it's nobody's business. It's a tool to help you continue on with life, and some dude isn't going to see the struggle parts of it, only the one snapshot of you being able to stand up real quick to hand something over.", ">It's better to ignore those people. Try not to engage.\n\nTrue, but this is mostly done for your own sake, not because of a duty to them.\n\n>Your response ... brought you down to his level.\n\nNot at all. The guy who starts berating a stranger on public transport is going to be on a lower level than the stranger who is defending himself.\n\nYou are right that not engaging is a better strategy, but the guy trying to call out the OP was the one being the AH. The OP was just being slightly foolish by taking the bait.", "sure just ignore somebody harassing you and allow them to continue thinking they're right to do so. great take. /s", "But what are you supposed to do otherwise, sit there and accept someone screaming abuse at you and do nothing? Why is it OP\u2019s responsibility to be the bigger person and speak politely and de escalate the situation when he is the victim here? And clearly what OP said worked like a charm because it got the guy to shut up and leave OP alone whereas by doing nothing he would\u2019ve just gotten more aggressive.", "It's tough because ESH implies both were equally at fault... which I don't think is true.  The instigator is more to blame.  But I still feel it's a shame OP had to respond so poorly (mainly for his own sake).", "ESH means they were both wrong in their behaviour.", "There wasn't anything to deescalate before OP engaged. It was just a crazy person talking to themselves. I imagine nearly everyone else on the bus/subway/etc. thought the same.", "And not saying anything tells the antagonist they weren't wrong", "i'm aware of the acronyms, thanks.\n\nhence why i'm commenting, because i believe that that defending yourself from somebody verbally harassing you in public doesn't make you an asshole. get that victim-blaming both-sides nonsense out of here.", "I disagree. These types are fishing for a reaction. Harshly responding only fuels them further (as in \"aha, see! you wouldn't be so defensive if you weren't doing something wrong\").", "I never said the crazy guy was right to act how they did. Your comment suggested I felt YTA was appropriate, not ESH. ESH means I feel both acted poorly. Two wrongs don't make a right, etc. Someone being an AH doesn't entitle you to be one in return.", "...bro, i can read. i'm aware you're putting equal blame on both parties. i am emphasizing the verbal harassment because i think your equal blame is a load of bull because i disagree that OP did anything wrong to defend or explain himself in the face of a random dude flying off the handle at him.", "I'm not putting equal blame on both parties.\n\nIn any case, this has run it's course."]}
