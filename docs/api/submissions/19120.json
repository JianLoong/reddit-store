NTA", "NTA!", "NTA\n\nThe guy was being ableist; just because someone isn\u2019t completely paralyzed doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t need a wheelchair. He\u2019s the one with a flawed assumption.\n\nAnd his friend\u2019s issue getting a wheelchair *have absolutely nothing to do with you*. There isn\u2019t some sort of lottery where only a limited number of folks can get a wheelchair. You aren\u2019t the reason his friend doesn\u2019t have his own wheelchair.\n\nAnd HE isn\u2019t the authority of who should or shouldn\u2019t have a wheelchair. HE is not your doctor. He has no business trying to judge someone\u2019s disability or act like he has any capacity to diagnose someone by looking at them. \n\nYou need a wheelchair because without it your mobility is significantly impaired. That includes the fact that while you may have the mechanical ability to walk, it can result in pain.\n\nPreventing and reducing pain is absolutely a part of treatment.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that.", "Nta. My so got dirty looks when they had to use those mobile chairs at Costco, even with their crutches on the back of it too. Some people need to learn to mind their own business", "NTA. Random strangers aren't owed an explanation or your medical history. Just because you're (relatively) young, doesn't mean you are automatically healthy. Use the aids you need, as you feel that you need them. You know your own limits.", "NTA. I\u2019m in the same position as yourself. I use a mobility scooter when I\u2019m out and about. I have a wheelchair for day trips where someone has to push me. With my mobility scooter I use a walking stick when it is not feasible to take my scooter into a shop. The nasty comments have come from elderly people. They mostly consist of \u2018you\u2019re too young to be using that scooter\u2019 or \u2018you don\u2019t look as if there\u2019s anything wrong with you\u2019. I just ignore them as let\u2019s be honest you can\u2019t argue with stupidity", "NTA.\n\nAnd I am so afraid something like this will happen to me. Since my accident I can only walk with krutches or sit in a wheelchair to make it easier until I recover and maybe even longer when they remove all the metal. I always feel so bad when people see me standing up. I feel like I am not allowed to have working feet while using a wheelchair. How stupid is that? I shouldn't have to feel that way. But I get a lot of stinkeyes.", "NTA - I can't stand for hours, so I have a wheelchair for anywhere that I don't have a seat. Everyone else can STFU.", "Definitely NTA. There are many wheelchair users who can walk. It\u2019s there to help you. You\u2019re allowed to use it, it seems medically necessary.", "NTA. I've got EDS, POTS, and Fibro, and I keep a cane, crutches, and a wheelchair for when I have flares or bad days or when I suspect that I might overdo it or be exhausted. Sometimes I wake up feeling fine, and some days, I feel like shit halfway through the day and need my crutches or my chair. \n\nI did my degree in disability studies and the amount of literature out there on this very issue is overwhelming. Some people believe they can define what our disabilities mean; it's entitlement at its finest.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong. You use your mobility aid if you want to, end of story.", "NTA", "NTA oh my god. This dude starts yelling at you unprovoked he's definitely the AH. Sorry you have to deal with bullshit like this \ud83d\ude14", "NTA. I can't help but wonder why the old guy thinks you having a wheelchair prevents anyone else from having one.", "What is it, like 70% of wheelchair users have some ability to walk? Think of it like glasses or hearing aids. They're mobility aids, they help! Why wouldn't you use things that help? NTA.", "I'm 4 weeks away from total knee(s) replacement and would love to have a wheelchair sometimes. I could be having a better day and then later in the day I can't walk. You do what you have to and avoid the pain", "NTA.\n\nThere is an old saying -\n\n>Don't set yourself on fire, to keep others warm.\n\nYes, you are more privileged than a paraplegic in that you get to walk occasionally.\n\nYes, you are more privileged to have a wheelchair for when you require it while other disabled people don't.\n\nBut giving it up and struggling isn't going to help them.\n\nAlso, It's not the bloody misery olympics.\n\nIt's like someone in a wheelchair saying that someone with crutches should vacate the disabled parking space because \"I need it more than you\" - which entirely misses the point. \n\nThey still need it.\n\nAble bodied people aren't allowed to eject someone from a train because they have to get home and \"need it more than you do\".\n\nThat's not how life works.", "NTA! For starters, a good day can turn into a bad day especially if you overtax yourself. Also, this loudmouth should've kept his trap shut. Many people are functionally wheelchair bound even if they can stand for a minute or walk a few steps. And reasonable people know that disability can strike at any age. Yes, the human body wears down and starts breaking with age but people can have problems at any point in their lives.", "NTA\n\nHalf or more if the people who use wheelchairs only need them some of the time.  Just ignore the judgmental AH.\n\nJust keep doing your PT and following your medical teams orders and advice.  When you need to use a WC, use it.", "NTA. Everyone has already covered the many and varied ways that guy was wrong; I'm just chiming in to add my support. It's scary and off-putting to have angry strangers pick a fight with you out of the blue, and I'm sorry he treated you like that. It's normal to feel vulnerable and shook up after that kind of experience, but I hope you're able to wheel your way around with confidence in spite of that AH.", "I am an ambulatory wheelchair user. Granted that I haven't used my chair to do anything besides sit for a few years, because of successful spinal surgery. I was a temporary paraplegic, and actually needed the chair for a few months. I have spinal stenosis. Since my paraplegic episode  I have had my left leg get paralyzed and had it fixed via surgery. One of these times, it will not be fixable. Take your feelings about my chair and shove them.", "NTA and that man is just an ignorant and selfish AH to the max.", "NTA at all. You have a medical condition and you have access to the tools required to support your daily life. He was (is) a complete AH. \n\nYou own and require the use of a wheelchair. That's not for fun. You don't joyride down the street filming videos for the internet, you're just existing. In what universe is that trash entity (person) living in?", "NTA, that man should mind his own fucking business. You need the chair, you can afford it, you owning a chair doesn\u2019t affect his friend, if he cares so much about his friend he can start a GoFundMe for him or buy it himself.", "NTA\n\nPeople are highly uneducated about the reality of disability. Most people think it's \"all or nothing.\" His lack of education is not your problem. He's the one choosing to speak on behalf of a group he knows nothing about. Also, how does you owning a wheelchair impact other people? It's not like there's a limited supply and you're stealing it from someone else. You having one isn't the reason other people can't afford one.", "NTA. Fuck that guy. \n\nI hope you never feel the need to disclose personal medical information to asshat strangers again.", "NTA these people screaming about \"fakers\" are absolutely ridiculous. I have fibromyalgia and the amount of people that have complained that I \"don't look disabled\" makes me want to SCREAM", "Yes! Instead of explaining yourself, ask what medical school taught them how to diagnose strangers at a glance and if they can get you a spot", "[removed]", "if it\u2019s helpful to you, you should have it. nta. the ignorance of other does not imply fault on your end.", "I also have POTS and I can get around in the house but not outside of it without help, so I have to use a wheelchair. I stress a lot about the idea of someone seeing me get up to maneuver a tricky area where it's easier/only possible to walk and assuming I'm \"faking\" and don't need it.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Yep, being able to sit down on a bus or train doesn\u2019t at all justify the hassle associated with using a wheelchair all day long.", "I read today that 75% of all wheelchair users are ambulatory to some degree", "/u/Characterarsnip is a bot that copied part of this comment and changed some words around to avoid detection: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142ert9/aita_for_using_a_wheelchair_when_i_can_walk/jn5fam8/"]}
