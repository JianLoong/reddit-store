They told him how rude it was to wear dark glasses when you're not actually out in the sun and especially because the day wasn't sunny anyway.\n\nHe took off his glasses and turned to face them. He had some hideous-looking eye condition that made his eye bright red and bulging. Apparently they had to stifle a scream.\n\nThat guy was my hero for the day.", "NTA my mom had severe arthritis.

I was watching a Molly Burke (blind youtuber) video a while back about how she travels. One of the things she said was that she's learned through the years that it's better to just get a wheelchair at the airport to get to the gate even though she can walk because a) it's less stressful for her guide dog or anyone accompanying her, b) airports are big and loud and scary so it's easy to get disoriented, and c) she's unfortunately found that if she's in the wheelchair it's less likely that she'll get sat in a corner for \"just a minute\" only to get completely forgotten by the staff member assisting her, especially bc she doesn't \"look blind.\"", "You do this to get a rise out of people.

There is nothing wrong with needing a mobility aid sometimes and not other times. Sometimes I need a walker because I have a dysautonomic disorder that makes me have heart palpitations, and if I don't sit down fast enough, leads to low blood pressure and fainting.  On good days I don't need the walker because my body is responding well to the medication. On bad days because my body isn't t responding to the medication (this is all newly diagnosed so we're trying to figure shit out) then I have to use my walker.  Disability isn't one size fits all.
