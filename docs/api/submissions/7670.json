My Fiance is M (34) and was born in Argentina. We met two years ago and just recently got engaged. Spanish is his native language and his family only speaks it, (his parents and siblings speak a little English). I have picked up on a few phrases he uses and words but not enough to get by. I have offered multiple times throughout our relationship to take classes and even begged him to teach me. I want to feel more connected with him and his family and I feel like learning his language is a good start especially now that we\u2019re engaged. He\u2019s told me that I don\u2019t have to and that it\u2019s a sweet offer but it\u2019s unnecessary. I always ask why and he always says the same shit that it would be too hard and it\u2019s not worth it bc his immediate family knows Eng and communicating with them is most important. Or that it wouldn\u2019t be authentic to the way his fam speaks. I argue that the few times we\u2019ve had dinner with the family the bulk of the convo was in Span and I felt left out. He argued back that he isn\u2019t going to learn Fuzhounese (the dialect my fam speaks) in return and he also feels left out. That wasn\u2019t even a valid statement bc we never speak Fuzhou around him and I barely know it, I would also never make him learn it.  \nHis mom planned a dinner to celebrate our engagement this past weekend at her place. It was a decent-sized gathering and I again was the only non-Span speaker. (My fam lives a state over and couldn\u2019t make it but we had plans to have another dinner all together.) I have been learning Span behind his back because I wanted to know if they were speaking badly of me. (My Span was nowhere near good enough). The week before I spoke with my friend who knows Span and asked if I could ft her so she could translate for me while I had AirPods in. At the dinner, I met some new fam members and they all said in Spanish, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting her to be Chinese\u201d.

They also made comments like my fam probably comes from nail salons. He told them to shut up but never really defended me. I spoke with his mom and sister a bit and they also made comments about me being with him for money, and they don\u2019t see what he sees in me. I overheard his mom saying an Argentinian girl would be a better fit but it\u2019ll bite him in the ass soon enough. I excused myself and took the car home. He texted me pissed that I would leave out of nowhere and leave him stranded. I explained to him what I did and I know eavesdropping is very wrong but I don\u2019t feel bad after what I heard. He said maybe their right and that I was an entitled AH for doing that and said this is why he was trying to protect me. He said that's how they are and they won\u2019t change but what pisses me off is he never speaks highly of me to them either or defends me as his fiance.

But it\u2019s disgraceful that OP had a friend privately translate the conversations for her?  Why?  Because shame on OP for secretly bringing in an ally translate the conversations so she can better learn her future in laws? \n\nThe party wasn\u2019t a family time reunion.  The party was apparently to celebrate OP and her hopefully former-fianc\u00e9 engagement and commitment to one another.  I don\u2019t know about you but I never went to a party where it\u2019s okay to openly say shit about the star of the party regardless of a language barrier.\n\nOP was in a disadvantaged situation and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family knew it.  They said shit in front of her because they expected no repercussions from their actions.  It\u2019s cowardly and two-face of them.  And fianc\u00e9 is the worse because he knowingly put her in a humiliating situation where OP is ridiculed with no means of defending herself.  Fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t need to attack his family in OP\u2019s honor.

If my partner was so staunchly against it, I'd require a real reason why, or I'd learn for the sake of finding out.\n\nIf the primary language of these gathering hadn't been the one they were trashing her in, she probably wouldn't have felt  the need to learn it and they'd have been able to keep their cover.", "Did we read the same post?  The whole first paragraph was about her wanting to learn Spanish for other reasons.  \n\nI don't blame her if she got suspicious after \\[ex?\\] fianc\u00e9 worked so hard to discourage her from doing so.", "She did want to learn for him. he pretty much forbid it. That's why she went behind his back, now she knows why he didn't want her to know what they were saying. NTA her fiance and his family are a whole other story.

Sorry in behalf of the country.\n\nBy the way, my wife is also younger than me and all my Argentinian friends' initial reactions were mostly being worried that I had suddenly become evil and was taking advantage of her.
