My Fiance is M (34) and was born in Argentina. We met two years ago and just recently got engaged. Spanish is his native language and his family only speaks it, (his parents and siblings speak a little English). I have picked up on a few phrases he uses and words but not enough to get by. I have offered multiple times throughout our relationship to take classes and even begged him to teach me. I want to feel more connected with him and his family and I feel like learning his language is a good start especially now that we\u2019re engaged. He\u2019s told me that I don\u2019t have to and that it\u2019s a sweet offer but it\u2019s unnecessary. I always ask why and he always says the same shit that it would be too hard and it\u2019s not worth it bc his immediate family knows Eng and communicating with them is most important. Or that it wouldn\u2019t be authentic to the way his fam speaks. I argue that the few times we\u2019ve had dinner with the family the bulk of the convo was in Span and I felt left out. He argued back that he isn\u2019t going to learn Fuzhounese (the dialect my fam speaks) in return and he also feels left out. That wasn\u2019t even a valid statement bc we never speak Fuzhou around him and I barely know it, I would also never make him learn it.  \nHis mom planned a dinner to celebrate our engagement this past weekend at her place. It was a decent-sized gathering and I again was the only non-Span speaker. (My fam lives a state over and couldn\u2019t make it but we had plans to have another dinner all together.) I have been learning Span behind his back because I wanted to know if they were speaking badly of me. (My Span was nowhere near good enough). The week before I spoke with my friend who knows Span and asked if I could ft her so she could translate for me while I had AirPods in. At the dinner, I met some new fam members and they all said in Spanish, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting her to be Chinese\u201d. Others also made comments about our age gap and how I was probably with him for the money because my \u201cpeople\u201d are known for that. They also made comments like my fam probably comes from nail salons. He told them to shut up but never really defended me. I spoke with his mom and sister a bit and they also made comments about me being with him for money, and they don\u2019t see what he sees in me. I overheard his mom saying an Argentinian girl would be a better fit but it\u2019ll bite him in the ass soon enough. I excused myself and took the car home. He texted me pissed that I would leave out of nowhere and leave him stranded. I explained to him what I did and I know eavesdropping is very wrong but I don\u2019t feel bad after what I heard. He said maybe their right and that I was an entitled AH for doing that and said this is why he was trying to protect me. He said that's how they are and they won\u2019t change but what pisses me off is he never speaks highly of me to them either or defends me as his fiance. His mom thinks I betrayed and embarrassed them and I was petty for doing that.", "created_utc": 1674067612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ff70w/aita_for_learning_spanish_behind_my_fianc\u00e9s_back/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact it's all dripping in racism... sheesh!\n\nI was leaning towards E-S-H initially based on your motivation for learning the language (you wouldn't have needed his permission to do it, just might've been nice) but in reality, learning a new language is not easy and it's your own business why you choose to do so.  You're not going through someone's secret messages etc...  Nor where you eavesdropping.  They're speaking infront of you, that's not a private conversation.\n\nYou're BF saying he was trying to protect you is a weak response.

Keep on with learning new things throughout your life. It keeps you young. Second: anyone who tells you your an asshole for learning new stuff (Doesn\u2019t matter what actually) is the asshole.

My uncle never defended her and it's safe to say they are no longer together(rightfully so). Don't ever feel ashamed and don't let them gaslight you. What they said was pure racist and there is no way your fiancee loves you if he would allow that. Furthermore, think about your children if you decided to have one. They will be half Chinese and their own father's side of the family will say racist shit to them. I would never allow my family to ever disrespect my friends in front of me let alone a fiancee.
