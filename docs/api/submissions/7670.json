My Fiance is M (34) and was born in Argentina. We met two years ago and just recently got engaged. Spanish is his native language and his family only speaks it, (his parents and siblings speak a little English). I have picked up on a few phrases he uses and words but not enough to get by. I have offered multiple times throughout our relationship to take classes and even begged him to teach me. I want to feel more connected with him and his family and I feel like learning his language is a good start especially now that we\u2019re engaged. He\u2019s told me that I don\u2019t have to and that it\u2019s a sweet offer but it\u2019s unnecessary. I always ask why and he always says the same shit that it would be too hard and it\u2019s not worth it bc his immediate family knows Eng and communicating with them is most important. Or that it wouldn\u2019t be authentic to the way his fam speaks. I argue that the few times we\u2019ve had dinner with the family the bulk of the convo was in Span and I felt left out. He argued back that he isn\u2019t going to learn Fuzhounese (the dialect my fam speaks) in return and he also feels left out. That wasn\u2019t even a valid statement bc we never speak Fuzhou around him and I barely know it, I would also never make him learn it.  \nHis mom planned a dinner to celebrate our engagement this past weekend at her place. It was a decent-sized gathering and I again was the only non-Span speaker. (My fam lives a state over and couldn\u2019t make it but we had plans to have another dinner all together.) I have been learning Span behind his back because I wanted to know if they were speaking badly of me. (My Span was nowhere near good enough). The week before I spoke with my friend who knows Span and asked if I could ft her so she could translate for me while I had AirPods in. At the dinner, I met some new fam members and they all said in Spanish, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting her to be Chinese\u201d.

They also made comments like my fam probably comes from nail salons. He told them to shut up but never really defended me. I spoke with his mom and sister a bit and they also made comments about me being with him for money, and they don\u2019t see what he sees in me. I overheard his mom saying an Argentinian girl would be a better fit but it\u2019ll bite him in the ass soon enough. I excused myself and took the car home. He texted me pissed that I would leave out of nowhere and leave him stranded. I explained to him what I did and I know eavesdropping is very wrong but I don\u2019t feel bad after what I heard. He said maybe their right and that I was an entitled AH for doing that and said this is why he was trying to protect me. He said that's how they are and they won\u2019t change but what pisses me off is he never speaks highly of me to them either or defends me as his fiance.

He has shown he will not support or side with you, and nod along while his family is blatantly racist. \n\nYou know what that makes him in turn, right?\n\nNTA.", "NTA.. \u201cyou embarassed us by understanding the racist shit we were spewing, how dare you, we knew we were right about you\u201d\n\nIm south american, and south american families are some of the most racist people on earth. Specially argentinians, because they think their british influence makes them the \u201ceuropeans\u201d of south america. Its disgusting and nonsensical. \n\nIf I was your fiance and my family said anything remotely close to that about you to my face, they wouldnt be seeing my face for much longer.\n\nYour fiance is just a coward trying to prevent you from understanding what they were saying so he could avoid dealing with it and taking a stand. Very mature 34 year old I can see..", "Let me get this straight. BF asks you not to learn spanish so his family can keep being racist around you, then when you learn this, he doubles down and says \"maybe they were right\" about being bigots?\n\nYou couldn't possibly be the asshole in this situation if you tried. This level of deception and victim blaming is utterly insane.", "YTA and I think you are telling the story with a significant bias and not telling the full truth\n \nYou violated family time by having a friend eavesdrop. Shame on your friend.\nYou also didn't learn Spanish. If you actually learned it enough to understand yourself, then I would side with you. But you cheated and used a friend because you wanted Intel. If you wanted to show respect to his family and culture by joining the conversation, you need to put on the work.\n\nIt is common for families think their culture is superior and that a loved ones life would be easier if their mate was from the same culture. Are you going to try to say your family doesn't feel the same way? You say you never hold conversation in your language with him? I find this hard to believe. \n\nDid you want him to attack his family defending your honor? If so, your an even bigger AH. This was not the time or place for a major confrontation, he respected that", "NTA - no one was eavesdropping, they were talking right there IN FRONT OF YOU. You have every right to be able to translate what they're saying.\n\nThey embarrassed themselves and betrayed YOU, not the other way around. The abuser always blames the victim.", "NTA.   I'm not saying what you did was right,  but I'm glad you followed your gut instinct and found out now that his family is not supportive or remotely nice.   If your gut tells you this won't work please listen to it.", "Mmmmm.... you weren't eavesdropping. You were listening. NTA, and lose this clown.", "They say don\u2019t ask questions if you are not ready for the answers.  OP you got answers lots of red flags now decide.", "There was already a lack of respect when they would speak a language they knew you didn't understand, so what you did make sense. You had a right to know the family you were planning to marry into, not to mention who you were planning to marry.  That was clever, good for you. NTA.", "NTA.  There is a difference between protecting you and protecting them.  It sounds like they are racist and he does not want you to hold it against him/them.  That is not okay.", "NTA. Dump him. It doesn\u2019t sound like he ever tries to defend you.", "NTA. \n\nYour AH fiance & -\ud83e\uddcd\u27a1\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\ud83d\uddd1\ufe0f\n\nImmediately.", "NTA. Let the wind in your face dry your tears. Bye Felicia!!!! Good god. If you were after his money you would suck up all the treatment lol how is leaving proving them right. They\u2019re just all about appearances and knew they were caught", "No but he was protecting her! Don\u2019t you see that? With out the partner op would have to sit there and have all these people talking shit right to her face \u2026 oh wait\u2026 that\u2019s exactly what it was with the fianc\u00e9\u2026 who didn\u2019t even defend her or have much issue with it. But he was protecting her you see!", "The \u2018why\u2019 is pretty obvious; it\u2019s the path of least resistance (cowardice).\n\u2018What she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her\u2019 while simultaneously avoiding conflict with his family. Everybody wins except OP when she actually marries into the family.\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s telling them to \u2018shut up\u2019 shows he doesn\u2019t agree with the statements, but he\u2019s too submissive to his family to defend her further.", "For real. My dad is Cuban. My parents went through a nasty divorce when I was young, and along the way I learned enough (including the curse words) to put together things my dad and his siblings were saying about my mom while my sister and I were sitting right in the room. They seemed to do nothing but trash talk her. As I learned more, I started picking up on lies he was telling - about us, our mom, his girlfriend - I wasn't fluent, but I could understand more than enough to get the gist of a lot of conversations. I should have kept it to myself because it came in handy, but I got so sick of it that I finally mentioned to him the conversation he had about how my mom drained his bank account (she didn't...his money was always \"went missing\" over the years...so many excuses). He was absolutely shocked and was careful to never do that again around us.", "Yeah, would the BF like it if OP made \"jokes\" about that or said they all must the ones be causing the soccer riots?", "This is definitely true but they really had open borders in general so my family moved there to escape the nazis. But maybe that\u2019s the difference in how my Argentinian family welcomes my Asian boyfriend (they love him) and how this racist family is reacting.", "\"Curious, why didn\u2019t you just ask him how his family felt about you?\"\nBecause lying liars lie. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWho would begrudge anyone who wants to learn a new language?? He may not have wanted to teach her, but why is he mad at her for learning.  That is just asshole-ish of him. Also, if you keep hearing someone saying your country/culture/race in your vicinity but using their native tongue wouldn't you want to know exactly what they are saying. The fiance was gaslighting OP making her believe that his family liked her, when infact they did not.", "He was protecting her by politely sweeping everything under the rug so nobody caused a scene. Can't you see that? /s", "Do that, If you want to know how to kick his poor ass to the curve in Spanish I'll make the exact translation for you", "This will never change. My mom suffered for years being left out of conversations while she was well aware my dad and his family were trash talking her right in front of her face. Special occasions became absolute torture, her personal hell, because of course they always denied it and then she was the unreasonable one. Don't do this to yourself.", "and he would never do the same for you, sis.  Don't marry this man.  He doesn't care about you, which is obvious because he DID NOT DEFEND YOU.  My ex is an alcoholic loser, but no matter how mad he was at me, he would take someone's head off if they talked about me like that.  Get you a man who does that but is NOT an alcoholic loser.  :)", "I'm jumping on the dump him train. The fiance chose OP. They say you can't help who u fall in love with, but if you go out into the world and choose to interact with someone from a culture/race/country that is different from yours, then u are effective CHOOSING that person to be some part of your life. Knowing his family he did exactly that, and failed to prepare OP for any backlash and he also failed in defending his own choice. Leave that man, he ain't the one."]}
