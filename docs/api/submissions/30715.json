{"id": 30715, "submission_id": "17s7jsz", "title": "WIBTA For Telling My Boyfriend That I Don\u2019t Want To Visit His Parents To Do Chores?", "selftext": "So I (22F) started seeing my boyfriend Jake (26M)  about a year ago, and we\u2019ve been living together three months now. His parents (60s M/F) are sweet people, and I try to visit them with my boyfriend when my days off line up right (1-2 times monthly). The only thing I find a bit odd is that nearly every time I visit, especially if we\u2019re there for 2-3 days instead of the regular 1, is that we\u2019re pretty much expected to take over chores and such while there and do house cleaning.\n\nNow, I completely understand picking up after ourselves, leaving things how we found it, and doing dinner clean up as a thanks for them making us supper. Helping out with feeding the cats and the chickens is also no big deal, and I love animals, so I\u2019m happy to share in the duties while playing with them. What\u2019s odd and feels overboard for me is when they ask us to clean their 2-story house, as in: mop and vacuum all the floors, do their laundry, clean each of the 2.5 bathrooms, and weed/tend the garden when it\u2019s spring/summer. They also ask us to tidy up the guest room when there are guests coming over and this most recent time said to the guest (another relative) that they would have to wait to put their bags down upstairs because \u201cthe maids aren\u2019t done yet\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t mind being helpful, and I do feel bad because they are getting up in age, but it feels alienating to be a guest preparing/cleaning for other guests and I feel stressed and almost insulted after putting in effort to come see them (I have to shift swap or request time off almost always because our schedules barely overlap) just to be put to work on my days off. I work long shifts on my feet (10-11 hrs), something they know, but it\u2019s still basically an expectation that when my bf and I visit we will do lots of housework for them. My boyfriend recently asked me if I could shift swap again and I told him I couldn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t told him that the reason is because I don\u2019t want to spend time with his parents just to be made to work on my days off. WIBTA if I told him the truth?\n\nEdit: I do want to clarify that I know 60-65 isn\u2019t elderly per se, but they\u2019re getting up in age and just have a harder time than some half their age, and the mother is in relatively poor health and doesn\u2019t do much house work because of that. She\u2019s not on deaths door, but she\u2019s quite frail due to some medical issues. Also, in case this context helps at all, my understanding of how to treat guests comes from how I was raised in the Deep South of the USA, while my bf and his family are New Englanders. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s some regional differences I\u2019m unaware of that would make this make more sense.", "created_utc": 1699633228, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s7jsz/wibta_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_dont_want/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd tell him, though. What you described as far as cleaning up after yourself and helping with dinner dishes is normal. Asking you to be their maids for a few days every visit is NOT okay.\n\nI'd be like WTF???? If your bf wants to clean his parents house, fine. Why they think it's okay to even ask *you* to clean is beyond me.", "60s is not old. You are being taken advantage of. I would never expect house guests to do anything more than pick up after themselves and leave the spaces they use as they found them. I would not be asking them to do my laundry or weed my garden!!!!", "I wouldn't want want a full fledged working weekend either. So, I wouldn't visit often. I don't mind helping out. But, I have my own home to clean and manage, so I don't want to feel anyone was waiting for me to return and clean their home too.\n\nNTA. Its not your home and you are a guest too, so I don't really get why you are being pressed into greater service than anyone else? (I always cut the grass at my folks' home and make dinner and wash the dishes and manage things overall when I visit. But, I never ask my husband to go through that with me. I do more now because my mom is old and she's a widow.)", "NTA.  \n\nMoping their floors?? \nDoing their laundry? \nThat is absurd. \n\nUnless they\u2019re not able bodied people, and genuinely need the help, but from the sounds of it, that isn\u2019t the case.", "If you see a long-term likelihood with your boyfriend, you need to speak the truth, rather than holding stuff in, lying, and/or becoming resentful.\n\nHis parents are taking advantage of you, and their son.  I can understand, as you do, the expectation of you to clean up after yourselves and in shared areas giving a hand, and maybe even occasionally helping with bigger chores like feeding pets and weeding the garden as an opportunity to bond.  However, doing this level of chores, while also doing their personal laundry, cleaning all bathrooms and vacuuming and mopping the entire house is overboard.  Referring to you both as \"the maids,\" furthermore, is insulting.\n\nIt is time to have a frank and honest conversation with your boyfriend, explaining that these expectations are unreasonable, and make you feel taken advantage of, and extinguish the enjoyment of visiting with them.", "NTA it\u2019s one thing for them to ask their son to do it, but asking you to do it seems OTT", "NTA. It isn't fair of him to expect you to do his parents chores. I totally understand him wanting to, they are his parents and they need his help. But it isn't right to just expect YOU to with no prior agreement or conversation.", "YWNBTA\n\nIts better to get this out in the open then waiting more time and it getting more expected in the future.  If this is a deal breaker on either side it's better to know now then later.  Being referred to as a maid when you are doing them a favor is despicable (even if they were kidding which I can't tell from the post).  Like you mentioned, tidy up, meal help/clean up is normal, but a full house clean just because you spent more then 1  day???? Yikes.  Your BF may not be able to say no, but him bringing you to help sounds a little like you're being Shanghaied and are forced labor.  Definitely discuss with him.", "YWNBTA. This is really weird", "NTA, but this is a boundary you need to get in place now.  \nI probably would have lost my shit over the \"maids\" comment.  \nBesides, maids get paid.", "Just tell him that you'll go visit them on the condition that you stay in a hotel, so that you can leave after the dinner dishes are done.\nNAH.", "NTA\nStop going for overnight visits. Don\u2019t do any cleaning - it seems like you have a good idea of what\u2019s appropriate to ask guests. \n\nIf their son wants to clean their house when he visits more power to him. Save your energy and enjoy some me time while he goes to clean.", "NTA. Are they stealth-training you to be a housewife?? For sure you must have an open conversation with your boyfriend, at the very least to get his opinion before you decide how you wish to move forward.", "You will be long term care giver next", "NTA. I recall helping inlaws with stuff like spring and fall yard cleanup back in the day. But only occasionally, and we were not given a long lust of chores every time we visited. That is nuts.", "NTA. 60 is not old. My 90 yo neighbor swiffers her floors & dusts from her walker. (She wants to stay active). You are being taken advantage of.", "NTA.  You're not a maid", "YWNBTA. They are clearly taking advantage of you. We have a saying in my country for the situations where someone expects us to do something ridiculous, especially a house chores we shouldn't have; Eat less and hire a maid. So yeah if they want their house chores to be done by someone else, they need to eat less and hire a maid.\n \nI don't know what do you think but I would talk to my bf in a case like that. I would want to see his reaction, because his reaction would be a sign of how the future is going to be with him.", "Nope, YWNBTA.  It's not your house nor is it your parents (not even your inlaws at the moment).  Your boyfriend can do it if he wishes, but he should tell his parents that you shouldn't be asked to do this.  \n\n\nTalk to your boyfriend.  I'm hoping he's reasonable about this.", "You do need to tell him the truth. You are being used as maid service and that's not right. If he's doing as much as you are expected to do, he may be as tired of it as you are. If you are expected to do more, they are being misogynistic. If you don't stop this now, it will not change.\n\nAfter you talk to your bf, you may want to cut down on the time you are there or just refuse to do the chores that you don't want to do. Their maid comment would have been enough for me. I'd told the right then that I am not their maid and quit doing anything for them. \n\nIf you are willing to work while you are there, you might tell them that you expect to be paid for it. Set a rate in advance (maybe twice the going rate for paid household services) and demand payment.", "NTA. The whole visiting a couple times a month for multiple days is rather unusual. Didn\u2019t say how far you travel for these visits, but it seems excessive, especially that you have to arrange time off.  Are the parents taking advantage or subtly trying to run you off?  It seems the former.  \n\nThink very hard about what your future with the boyfriend might become - you\u2019ve been relegated to \u2018maid\u2019 status and your significant other doesn\u2019t have a problem with this. If he\u2019s an only child this situation can only get more complicated.", "NTA-\n\ndraw a boundary.  I am not a maid. When I am visiting, I am a guest in your home, not your servant. If that is not something upon which we can agree, then I will not be in your home at all.", "YWNBTA... tell your boyfriend that you dont mind helping out as a guest but you are not a maid. Tell him you expect him to discuss this with his parents. That if it doesnt change immediately- he can visit them on his own. \n\nThis is a bad sign. 1 he is enmeshed. 2. He doesnt protect you. 3. He doesnt stand up to them. \nThese could be deal breakers if he doesnt get them fixed.", "NTA. What on earth? They are only 60. My parents are in their 70\u2019ies and they clean and cook for guests. This is just bizarre.", "NTA.\n\nSimple solution is to not go anymore.", "NTA. But you really need to tell your bf you aren\u2019t his parents maid. The discussion needs to be had.", "NTA. You are being used.", "NTA. But maybe everyone assumes you are okay about it because you do it.  You need to sit down with you boyfriend and talk about what is going on.  You need to hear his perspective.  This should guide your approach.  You don't want to complain about his parents to him if he thinks this is okay and a son and his girlfriend's duty.  \n\nYou need to put your position on the table.  Write some notes if you think this will help. Tell him you were raised with a different perspective on your role as a guest.  Don't be passive aggressive and simply stop being available.  Talk it out", "dude. they literally called you guys maids. i'd stop going over there yesterday. NTA.", "YWNBTA \n\nIt's odd and rude as they are able bodied.\n\nAlso aren't you wondering that it seems as if though he spends an exorbitant amount of time with his parents?\n\nI could see swapping a shift for some special or one-off weekend but 1 to 2 times a month seems weird to me as it seems you have to travel there as well.\n\nI would explore the frequency of visits and wonder if he's a bit of Momma's / Papa's boy dealy.  You don't want to get involved with one if they can't disconnect.", "NTA\n\nThey may not like you and think if you are made to work you will stop visiting.", "NTA and it's rude to ask a guest in your home to clean it for you. I don't think that's a regional issue, just a human norm. You need to discuss this with your bf because if y'all are living together, there's a chance these people may become your in-laws and it will be too late by then to bring up something you should have brought up now. \n\nIf they need assistance around the house due to his mother's health, then he should discuss that with them and find out if there's a way to hire someone to clean. You are not their free maid.", "NTA.  New Englander here, and while it is expected to pitch in when visiting family, it's the normal level you describe such as picking up after oneself, maybe cooking a dinner and cleaning up after.  As a New England guest, I would strip and remake the bed I used before leaving, and probably clean up the kitchen after meals.  But being expected to do a deep clean of bathrooms, guestrooms and mopping floors - no, that's not normal expectation.  Being called \"the maids\" - maybe that's your boyfriend's mom's sense of humor?  If she is a little embarrassed about not being able to do the cleaning herself and is actually relying on her son (and now you) to do the cleaning, this could be her way of deflecting and making fun of the situation.  \n\nHowever, you have come into this situation.  If your boyfriend has been doing this for his parents all along, and has developed this expectation with them, he may be fine doing this for his parents.  That's fine for him, but you shouldn't be expected to be happy to join in.\n\nYou need to use your words with him and ask him about this.  Has he always done this for him?  Is he okay with it?  If he doesn't do the cleaning, does it simply not get done?  And then let him know that you are exhausted after working and don't have the energy to go visit them and do all this extra work.", "NTA, tell him but pick your words wisely.", "NTA. And as a New Englander with a big extended family who are also all New Englanders, no this isn\u2019t a regional difference thing. I don\u2019t know of anyone in my family who would expect this. *Maybe* if you were there for an extended (a week or more) amount of time and they were planning a party or event at their house that you were going to. So if you\u2019re there for a week before Christmas, maybe doing some extra tidying up before a big Christmas dinner with lots of people, for example. But at regular visits? No way.", "NTA\n\nYou may want to have a firm discussion with your bf about boundaries and respect.\n\nIf his parents were ill or infirm i could understand them asking for help.  But expecting you to clean the house, feed animals, while referring to you as maids?  Nope. That crosses the line.  \n\nDoes your bf have siblings and are they treated the same?\n\nDoes your bf visit your parents with the same frequency he expects you to visit his?  \n\nWhat is your bf's view on his parents expecting this level of work? \n\nWhat happens if you have kids, will you be expected to watch your kids and clean their house?\n\nDoes he offer to do the same chores at your parents as his parents expect of you when you visit them?", "The problem isn't with grandma/grandpa...it's bf.  He's 'allowing' this to continue and he should tell his family that visiting shouldn't be encumbered with chores on your part.  If he wants to do them then that's on him...but you should just stay home.", "I'm going to propose an alternative explanation. Perhaps his parents want a bit of space themselves, and so are trying to keep you and your bf busy so his parents don't feel they have to entertain you 100% of the time. 2 or 3 days can be a long time for a visit, especially when it's just the two of them and they're used to having the place to themselves.\n\n60's is not too old to clean a house and yard by themself, so I doubt it's needed work.\n\nSo yes, you'd be best to skip most of these visits, or keep it to 1 single day, and they would probably appreciate that.", "NTA, but I don't necessarily think they are AHs either. It sounds like maybe this is an expectation they have of their son when he comes home, and maybe when he previously brought gfs home, they helped out too bc they just wanted to help him. And now it has morphed into this thing they expect. \n\nI think you need to have a discussion with your boyfriend that, while you're fine picking up and helping with a few chores during your time at his parents, it's gone a little far and you all need to re-evaluate what should be expected of you.", "Next time you get roped into it, ask at the first request to do maid work what the pay will be.  If no pay, now maid service.  The pay should be at least double your regular wage as it is being asked on your days of rest.", "YWNBTA but I would approach it delicately. Depending on the type of relationship you have with your boyfriend you should know if he would or wouldn\u2019t take offense. Just tell him you want to limit the visits because of the work you\u2019re expected to do on your days off. \n\nEven if you didn\u2019t have to do chores, it is not too much to ask for you to relax in your own home or do hobbies on your days off.
