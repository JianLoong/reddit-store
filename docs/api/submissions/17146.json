She gave birth to her seventh child only a few days before I gave birth to my only daughter. Maddy and I were always close. She was supportive when I was bullied in high school, she was a shoulder for me to cry on when an OB told me I would never be able to have children biologically, she was there when an ex broke my heart and she helped me talk through the conversation I had with my husband when we were dating about me not being able to have kids. I was also there for her. When she lost her best friend right out of high school, when her husband deployed overseas while he was in the military, when she had her first four babies and needed a birthing partner and her husband was overseas. When she needed a place to stay because her home was broken into. We were always very close as sisters and we were more than that, we were friends.\n\nThe joy when I learned I was pregnant was quickly erased when I started to have complications and I spent 99% of the time worried I had gotten so lucky and might not be able to have a healthy baby at the end of my pregnancy. My sister was not really supportive during this time. Our parents were though. They helped out while my husband worked (I had to leave my job because of my complicated pregnancy). They were so excited for me.\n\nMy parents were babysitting for my sister and her husband when she had her baby. And they waited at the hospital with me when I gave birth to my beautiful daughter. They helped by bringing my husband food and something to drink because he was stressed and worried and needed some support too. I was in the hospital for a week and when I was released I called my sister and she was short with me. I tried not to let it get to me and focused on my daughter. Then a couple of weeks passed and she showed up. This happened last week. My sister shows up and accuses me of undermining the joy of her child and saying I hogged our parents and wasn't there for her like I always was before. My husband told her to calm down. She told me how our parents did everything to cater to me and how they were coddling me and fawning all over me and my daughter and making a big fuss about her name and showering her with so much stuff when her little one didn't get the same. She told me I waited so long to have a baby and then saddle her with a shitty ass name that everyone will make fun of her for. Then she said I was selfish for getting pregnant when she was pregnant and I burst into tears. My husband lost it with my sister and told her to leave and not to come back. She was yelling at me asking how I could let him kick her out like that. And ever since she has been texting asking how I could allow him to treat her that way.\n\nI'm so upset at how bad our relationship has become.

Your sister was jealous she didn\u2019t have the spotlight and your husband saw right through her bullshit. Good for him. Good for you. If your sister could be so callous when she should\u2019ve been stoked, I don\u2019t think she saw you as closely tied as you might\u2019ve. \n\nConcentrate on your new little. Give your husband a pat on the back. Give yourself space to grieve this hurt. I know this sucks right now, but I promise you\u2019re in the best hands because they\u2019ve already protected you.

This was your first and there were complications.  She was out of line and sounds like a narcissist", "She had 6 opportunities to be showered and suddenly she needs all the attention? NTA, even more so that you we\u2019re having complications", "Sounds like your sister loved having you at her whim, and probably never had any intention of reciprocating. Most people who have kids know the first in a nuclear family is usually a bigger deal than the 7th in the same (especially regarding fertility issues, congratulations OP!!). You talk about being there for her the whole time she was having children; though for your *first* she couldn\u2019t consider you at all, and had the gall to accuse you of being selfish? NTA, your sister is having some projection issues. Maybe she\u2019s had it rough, but that doesn\u2019t mean YOU are being selfish for trying to care about your own family now.", "NTA at all and congratulations on your beautiful new addition to your family and having a supportive partner! \n\nShe CLEARLY believed she held a special spot in your family due to her seemingly endless fertility. You have changed that. There is zero doubt in my mind that she truly believed her children would be your only children and that you would be back up parents for life. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to undermine your relationship with your sister , but I would take a good, long, objective look at how the cards have actually been being dealt\u2026 was she really there to support you? Or were you just the golden goose?", "NTA- your sister was only there for you because she likes feeling \u201cabove\u201d you . You being in distress makes her feel like she\u2019s got it better than you .\n\nNow that you have a kid and your parents are paying attention to her she\u2019s mad that she\u2019s not getting all the attention .\n\nDon\u2019t let her emotionally manipulate you by starting shit with your husband. \n\nThink about it, if she gets you to leave your husband for disrespecting her, then you will once again be in a worse situation than her , and then she can go back to feeling like she has it better than you.\n\nJust go no contact until she apologizes becaue I promise she will give you and ultimatum trying to make you choose between her and your husband.", "NTA It sounds like your sister was used to having all eyes on her and her children. Now, she's being selfish and jealous about sharing that attention. It's especially awful knowing what a gift your baby is for you. Of course, your parents are excited for and supportive of you and your husband. Your sister should be, too.", "NTA - OP, I am so sorry. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s under a lot of pressure with that many kids and a husband who is frequently gone, and she may be having a hard time with hormones and even PPD. However, she knew her situation with her husband, and she knew she already had six kids. If she is stressed, she\u2019s also chosen to directly contribute to it by having another child. She can\u2019t expect everyone to treat her, on her seventh child, the same way they would treat you, your first pregnancy with higher risk for complications.\n\nYou needed support in this time, it was your first pregnancy and it was very high-risk. There is no world in which you\u2019re the AH here. Your sister was very out of line with everything she said, and it seems like she said every vicious thing she could think of just to hurt you. She owes you an apology and your husband did right by removing her from the situation.", "Wow. So she thought she should be able to just attack you without interruption? And now she's blaming you for allowing your husband to interrupt?\n\nShe had SIX kids before this, and I'm sure your parents gave her plenty of attention then.\n\nShe could probably let you have the spotlight for your one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA ...your sister has 7 kids.....you finally had ONE after thinking you couldn't....and she's mad because your getting all the attention?   YOU deserve every bit of attention right now!!!!.... and your hubby sounds like a keeper.", "So... you were living your life under the assumption that you could NEVER get pregnant, when suddenly you did. I'm guessing completely unexpected (though very wanted!). So due to this miracle - again, unexpected - she thinks you're selfish? Because she was already pregnant, for the 7th time? It sounds like your sister has \"main character syndrome\" (which I know isn't actually a medical diagnosis). Sometimes, the people we love the most can also hurt us the most, and it's clear your sister did exactly that-  I'm glad your husband had your back, and was willing to remove the obvious source of stress for you. NTA, and congratulations on your baby!", "NTA\n\nYour husband did the right thing and you shouldn't feel guilty for letting him handle it. Your sister got used to being the center of attention when it came to the kids. It's extremely unfortunate that she's not able to see how disgusting she's acting right now.\n\nMy advice, don't respond to her at all until it's an apology. When she apologizes, take that time to let her know how deeply hurt you are that through everything you've both been through, this one thing that she got to experience 7 times, you only get to experience once and that's considered lucky, she made it about her.\n\nI know you're really upset, but don't let her ridiculousness put a hamper on something so amazing! Congrats on your little one!!", "Nta.  Your sister deserved it.  What an ungrateful person.", "NTA. She was antagonizing you, so she got what she deserved.", "Holy shit NTA - I\u2019m glad you have a supportive husband who stood up for you", "NTA. It sounds like she (subconsciously?) enjoyed being the sister who could provide your parents with grandchildren. Your being pregnant changed all of that. I\u2019m sorry that this is putting a shadow over what should be a wonderful time in your life. Please just enjoy your daughter and give yourself the space YOU need.", "Time to go low contact. Her behaviour is abhorrent.", "OMG, no, you are soooo NTA and I am so proud of your husband for sticking up to you like that.  I have no idea what's wrong with your sister, but it is without a doubt not your fault.", "NTA. Sounds like your hubby is a great guy. 7 kids? Holy sh--.", "NTA. Your sister was terrible towards you for all sorts of messed up reasons. Your husband did the right thing.\n\nYou should go no contact with her until she realizes how wrong she was and works to make amends. You're not obligated to talk to her ever again, but that would be the bare minimum for having her be in your life.", "Nta at all your sister needs some chill time i wouldnt talk to her again until she grows up and says she sorry", "NTA.  She is behaving like a bully and your husband did what he should, protect his family.  She may have been really close to you and you may need to be the one to tell her that she is now your bully and you won\u2019t let her insult you or your family.  It hurts because you expected more from her but it seems like she is taking out her frustration with your parent\u2019s lack of attention on you.  Newsflash:  they\u2019re adults.  They can decide where they want to be.  Don\u2019t let her toxic ass ruin your joy of a baby.", "NTA\n\nSounds like sister is VERY jealous of the fact that you have some attention.  You thought you'd never be able to have a child so she was able to have all the attention.  Suddenly, you have a baby yourself, and now she has to share the attention.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.  It is OK to grieve the relationship that has essentially ended.\n\nCongrats on the new baby!", "NTA. First, CONGRATULATIONS on your baby!!!!!!!  How wonderful for you, hubby and family. \n\nSecond:  Your sister is JEALOUS. That\u2019s all it is. She\u2019s butthurt for stupid reasons. Block her and don\u2019t think about it. Concentrate on your baby, enjoy life. If sister wants to be an ass, let her, you just don\u2019t have to watch it/hear it.", "NTA. Your sister is a baby making machine who got used to being the center of attention.\n\nYou've had one complicated pregnancy and one child -- a child you never thought you would be able to have. Of course your family has been concerned about you and is celebrating your one and only child more excitedly than your sister's seventh. And of course you \"weren't there for her\" while you were dealing with your own difficult pregnancy.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Your husband did nothing wrong. Your sister expects to the be main character in your story, too, not just hers.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you had a great relationship with your sister but your sister's relationship with you is entirely dependent on you being available 24/7 for her. Now she sees you as competition for her and her true self is hanging out there for all to see.\n\nFocus on your own family and be as happy as you feel. Congratulations!", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your sister is having a tough time accepting that your parents probably won't be caretakers for her 7th child.", "NTA. Your sister is definitely TA. Maybe her emotions need to be sorted out, maybe she's dealing with a little postpartum stuff, but she was way out of line. She clearly has had no problem having children. You have. You had a frightening and complicated pregnancy and this was your 1st child. Maybe your only child. Why on Earth would she suggest that you shouldn't have gotten pregnant? She is being more than thoughtless. Your parents have done the right thing supporting you.  And so did your husband. Your sister owes you a very big apology and maybe she will eventually see that", "NTA- your sister is showing her true colors now that she has realized she is in fact not the main character. Enjoy your beautiful daughter!", "NTA. She should\u2019ve SUPPORTED you through this scary time, just as you supported her for years. You didn\u2019t made her feel bad for you not being able to have children - how dare she berate you for taking a modicum of attention for ONE baby?! \n\nTake care of yourself and enjoy your baby!", "Your sister is a jealous asshole. She is on child seven. How do you plan conception around that? Even if you just got lucky.\n\nOf course your parents made a fuss because you were a high risk pregnancy and it was your first. It's all new and you need support. What a vile way to carry on. \n\nNTA", "Your husband did what any good husband would do and that was to show your sister the door. Congratulations to you both on your little one. Take care. NTA.", "NTA obviously,  sounds like sister is jealous she is no longer the only one having kids.", "Seven kids!!  That\u2019s just selfish and nobody cares anymore.", "NTA. And your husband for sh\\*t sure is NTA. Your sister was being ridiculous. Do not feel guilty for this.", "Nta. Your sister sounds selfish af. I'd go low contact for a while. Step back and enjoy your family. You worked hard for it. Yay for husband for getting her out! \nCongratulations for baby!", "NTA. This relationship is not at all what you think. I'm sorry.", "NTA sorry to say it but it sounds like she'd prefer it if you weren't able to have kids", "NTA - your sister is a selfish nightmare. Your husband is a hero as are your parents.", "NTA and your sister sounds jealous and terrible. Your husband is a great guy", "It sounds like your sister was used to being the centre of everyone\u2019s universe. When it was about you it was ok because you were discussing issues that made her feel superior to you. (You 0 kids and struggling to have 1, her with her brood)\n\nThe moment it was about you in a joyous happy way she flipped her lid. She is not happy for you. I would go NC.", "It\u2019s sounds to me that the weight of seven kids will feel a little heavier to your sister now that you\u2019ll be less available for her to lean on as you\u2019re a new mother. In addition, the fact that your parents wanted to be there for you at around the same time she expected them to be helping her, has apparently upset her. \n\nI don\u2019t want to go right to a dark place, but it seems like she\u2019s super pissed that she lost you as a helper and will now have to share your parents as they will want to split their grandparent time between you now. The dramatic change in your relationship lines up with your pregnancy. She either was happy being the only one with kids and hates you stealing her spotlight or she really thought she\u2019d always have multiple extra adults around to help with her parenting needs. \n\nCongratulations on finally becoming a mom and happy Mother\u2019s Day! NTA", "INFO - Was there a history of her feeling neglected by your parents because of you, or is this the only time something like this has ever been mentioned? Also, it\u2019s unclear how much time passes between your two pregnancies?", "NTA at all. There\u2019s a 1% chance your sister has some sort of PPD or PPA-it can come on before birth-and that would explain her sudden shift. So if this is TRULY unlike her, see if you can talk to her when things have calmed down. If she continues to double down, grieve this loss of a close sister without feeling guilty. Do not for ONE MINUTE let her feel bad about you or your baby. You didn\u2019t demand anything; your family was there for you in ways you needed and they did NOT neglect your sister and her seventh child.", "NTA for sure, in my opinion your sister thought that you\u2019ll going to support her all the time and once you become pregnant and your parents and husband begin to support you because it\u2019s really important for you so your sister didn\u2019t have that much support as she expected and she became mad at you. I think after some time your relations with your sister will be good \ud83d\ude42 hope you and your child are ok \ud83d\ude42", "I'm gunna say a tentative NSH. From what you say you and you're sister have always been very close and supportive of each other... so this is completely out of character. Both of you have just had a baby, so emotions and hormones will be all over the place. You're sister has behaved badly, but this isn't normal behaviour for her. I'm making assumptions but I'd guess that as yours was a complicated pregnancy you've probably, and understandably, been focused on that for several months.\n\nMaybe there's something else going on here, is she having marital issues, was her husband able to be there for her during pregnancy and birth or did his work prevent this? You've done nothing wrong, and I get how hurtful this situation is. But it seems you two were extremely close, she's never behaved like this before... if it was me I'd try and look deeper.\n\nPeople are so quick here to say cut her off, go low contact, but this sounds like an important relationship to you which is worth saving. Maybe she's just feeling overwhelmed and struggling in general and is lashing out at you. Maybe reach out and say even though what she's said and how she acted really hurt you, you sense that she's feeling hurt and unheard too and you want to be able to be there for each other. See if she takes a breath and opens up a bit in response.\n\nThe priority is take care of yourself, but it seems like this relationship is worth the effort to you. Good luck", "[deleted]", "NAH seems that stress and pregnancy hormonal changes, has caused stress to get everyone on edge.

Tell her you'll be taking a break from her drama for a while.  She can let your mom know when she's not feeling so angry about everything and maybe you can rekindle your relationship.  I'm sorry she's abandoned you.  She could have been so helpful since she's been through this so many times.", "Your husband is a total gem. Focus on the joy of your child and your marriage. She\u2019s upset you\u2019re getting the attention she usually gets.", "NTA. It's sad to see the lack of empathy from your sister with such a delicate matter. I could be wrong but maybe her hormones played a role in her bad behaviour? Either way your husband was right to kick her out. You have an awesome partner and now a beautiful baby!", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your sister is having a selfish moment right now. Hopefully its more hormones than jealousy that she now has to share the mommy spotlight with you. Your husband did what he was supposed to do which was support you and worry about your wellbeing.", "NTA, and something similar happened to me with my SIL after we finally adopted our newborn son (like your situation, a kind of miracle). I had helped a lot when her kids were born, especially Nos 2 and 3, and I felt very close to all of them and was so excited that I was finally joining the mom club. But when she and my brother and their kids came to visit a few weeks after my son came home, she was just as needy and moody as she had been when she was newly post partum. My brother finally said it was giving her issues to see how happy I was because she hadn't felt like that about her babies. I was so hurt and upset - it's the one sad memory I have of that happy newborn time. What I finally realized is that I had established the relationship as being the indispensable helpful caring SIL, and she wanted me to keep being that, and she was jealous that it was changing. Sounds like you're getting a version of this from your sister, only more so. It took me a couple of years to get past it and I never did quite feel the same about her, but we eventually grew close again. Notably, my husband's sister was also kind of weird about our baby. I think women who have established themselves as \"the mom\" in a family have very complicated feelings when they have to share that spotlight, and feel a bigger deal is being made of late-arriving babies than was made of their own (partly because they don't remember accurately). Huge congratulations on your baby and try to let your sister go for a bit - she's being  wildly irrational and a jerk, but she may come round.", "NTA as everyone else said, she has been pregnant 7 times and didn\u2019t think she needed to share anyone\u2019s attention. She is selfish and jealous of you. She thought she would have you (and your parents) for life, to take care of her kids, to be anything and everything she needed. Then she not only disrespected you and your husband, she disrespected your daughter over a name. \n\nIf she has never acted this way before I would say she is dealing with PPD or some other post pregnancy psychosis, and needs to seek out professional help. However if you look back and see that this is how she always was whenever you needed someone or something, then I would say that you are now seeing her true colors. \n\nGo no contact until she gets the help, you can tell her as much yourself. I would also call your parents and tell them the same thing you told us, that there is something going on and she was never like that before and that she might need professional help, I would also tell your parents that you are going no contact with her until she gets the help she needs. \n\nAgain NTA and congratulations on your baby!", "NTA husband did his job, protected you when you weren't in the right mind to protect yourself, that's a good man. Your sister is the one in the wrong, you have nothing to do with your parents treatment of her baby and she should never have tried to pin that on you. She's making you out to be the bad guy when you have nothing to do with it. \n\nAlso not that weird that your parents would be putting more attention on you and your baby, it's your first child, also one you were told you'd never get, it makes sense they'd be excited for this child and go out of their way to help you. This is your sisters 7th kid, while the birth is absolutely a joy and should be treated as such, she's experienced in childbirth. While it's not ideal that you'd both give birth so close together, it's nobody's fault and honestly I think it's gonna help make the two kids closer as they grow up, at least the pictures will be cute. It put your parents in a situation where they may have felt like they had to choose who to support, and obviously someone's first childbirth + complicated pregnancy makes sense as a choice. Encourage your sister to talk this out with your parents and leave you and your baby out of it, go low contact (or no contact) until she gets her head back on straight. Hope it's just pregnancy hormones and not a long term thing.", "NTA. Block your sister's number and focus on your family.

Your sister is green with envy by the fact you had the spotlight for a minute and not her.", "It sounds like your sister\u2019s only way of getting attention is by having kids. Imagine being born just because your mother wants attention. \n\nNTA", "NTA - I have no idea what went through your sister's head, but *who does that*? Who goes up to a new mother and spews vitriol, in particular after a difficult pregnancy, a pregnancy that was deemed unlikely to ever happen, your first and only child, this life event is MAJOR for you on so many levels and this is how she treats you?\n\nI am so happy for you that you have your husband on your side, supporting and loving you, being there for you. The best wishes to you, your young one, and your family. I hope your sister finds her heart again.", "NTA. It sounds like she's so used to her and her kids getting all the spot light that she hates that she didn't have it this time around. Your husband did the right thing when she started to throw a fit. \n\nCongratulations, don't let your sister diminish the joy you have because she's jealous.", "I'm going to try to put the best possible interpretation on your sister's actions, because it sounds as though you've typically had a warm, loving relationship and this has come completely out of the blue.\n\nPretty much every family has roles that people grow into over time. These roles help us navigate life together with a sort of shorthand -- we know how everyone will react to most situations in advance, so we can keep everything running smoothly. If the family is a ship, everyone in it has a role to play. Someone might be the captain, someone else is the cook, another person is always cleaning up other people's messes.\n\nProblem is, sometimes those roles are dysfunctional or unfulfilling or limiting. The cabin boy doesn't want to be the cabin boy forever. When someone changes their role in the family, and how they interact with the rest of the family, it upsets the emotional equilibrium of everyone else. The ship isn't sailing smoothly anymore.\n\nIn your case, the change was happy. Most of the emotional changes were happy too! That's partly because while you changed your family role, your parents' family role has only been increased a bit -- their job is still *happy loving grandparents*.\n\nBut your sister's role has been completely upended by your role change. She's gone from *the only mum* and *the comforter of OP* and *the person who can rely on OP for family support* to someone for whom none of that is true. And **she should be happy for you FFS because that's what someone who loves you would be** after all your heartbreak. \n\nSo I'm not giving her a free pass. I'm not saying her behaviour is OK. I guess my point is -- if it's out of character, then maybe it'll help you to understand that her world has probably changed hugely in the last few months, and maybe she's reeling from trying to fathom the changes. And instead of processing those changes and dealing with reality, she's decided to yell at the 'cause' of the change.\n\nOf course you're NTA for getting pregnant (at any point - geez freaking Louise, how much time does she spend not pregnant anyway?), having a baby, or getting help and attention from your parents. And congratulations! \ud83c\udf89 You must be so happy about your little miracle bub.

Wow, turns out she doesn't support you when her 7th child is affected (or at least in her perception). And to be fair, that child should still be celebrated but let everyone calm down first. For goodness sake, you were in the hospital for a week!!!\n\nYou had no control over this, and of course people will be extra excited given the facts. Congratulations!!!", "Nta She said everything she could to hurt you then acted like you're the bad guy for not presenting an easier target.", "NTA She has done this 7 times, 7 baby showers and 7 baby names and 7 births, all of this with all of the support in the world, and it's really sad that she can't let go of the spotlight for this moment that was so important for you, this is your first baby, enjoy her, don't waste valuable time of this period of your life that will pass by so fast thinking about someone who tried to darked what is supposed to be one of the best moments in your entire life, enjoy your baby that is so loves, enjoy your wonderful husband who isn't afraid to defend his family, enjoy your parents and enjoy this new chapter of your life\ud83e\ude77", "She was raining kids and you were in a drought.

She had the spotlight on her and she just can\u2019t drop it for a second. For her to blame you because your parents were happy for you? You don\u2019t owe her anything.

A problem Not hers? The horror/s\n\nIt was her 7\u2019th child (Seventh) she\u2019s spend more time pregnant than the average person does in school! (Taking into account than some don\u2019t get to go to school at all) if she didn\u2019t have most of it down by now she has bigger problems than being selfish.\n\nYou on the other hand was pregnant with your first when you never expected to be able to get pregnant at all. It\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019d need more care, comfort and support than with the average pregnancy.\n\nOf course your parents will shower you and your child in attention they know as well as you do that they realistically won\u2019t get to do this for you and a child of your again, while they have already been through it six times with your sister. (Plus you have one baby, not one baby and six older children to take the attention so it\u2019s easier and less stressful to focus on one baby. Likely calmer as well.)\n\nEnjoy your miracle baby. Ignore your sister\u2019s bitterness at no longer being the only one to \u2018give your parents grandchildren\u2019.", "NTA. Your sister is acting terribly, and needed to be thrown out. If she's never attacked you like this before, and was stand offish your whole pregnancy, there could be PPD in the mix now, on top of pregnancy hormones, jealousy and not knowing how to relate to you, now that you're not the infertile sad sister in her super fertile earth mother self image. I truly hope when her brain flushes out, she comes to you with a heartfelt apology.\n\nCongratulations to you and your hubby!", "NTA. She's jealous", "NTA.... If this is out of character for her, then give her time to come around. You describe a history of a lifetime of support and this may be about something entirely different. Your husband did right. Maybe get some counseling to explore your relationship, maybe there is something you haven't seen. \nCongratulations and best wishes.", "Your husband\u2019s a trooper! As to your sister, I guess she \u2018s so accustomed to being the one who gets the adulation when she\u2019s pregnant, that she became jealous and awful. There\u2019s no ex use for that behavior from her.", "This a million times this your sister is in the wrong you were so supportive for her but when it came time for you to have that same support from her she chose to make it all about her. Clearly she doesn\u2019t value you as much as you do her. Congrats to you on your little one from someone who was told she\u2019d never have children I now have 3 of my very own to love.", "Now she\u2019s gotten a taste of how each of the seven children living in a frequently single-parent household feel on a daily basis.", "Talk about diminishing returns\u2026", "As someone dealing with a similar situation\u2026\n\nNo. She wasn\u2019t.\n\nI strongly suggest therapy, because it took me *two years of therapy* to start piecing together all of the red flags my own \u201csister\u201d had been dropping for over twenty years before she \u201csuddenly\u201d turned on me.\n\nI came to realize that she was only supportive towards me the way she was towards any of the other exotic pets in her care. I was to be carted about to make herself look better by comparison, have my enclosure cleaned up, and then expected to keep quiet the entire rest of the time.\n\nThe breakdown started when I graduated college\u2026and she didn\u2019t.\n\nIt got worse when I got a full-time job\u2026and she didn\u2019t.\n\nThe deterioration was so gradual and so slow that even though I realized *something* was wrong, I couldn\u2019t figure out what. When I tried communicating with her about it, she would just smile and insist that I must be paranoid and it was all in my head.\n\nThen, shortly after I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt, she went from \u201cshowing up in the ER crying about how much she would miss me if I was gone\u201d to treating me like I didn\u2019t exist to finally accusing me of anything and everything she could think of.\n\nShe never saw me as a \u201csister.\u201d Not really.\n\nI was just her helpless Autistic pet\u2026until I stopped being helpless and therefore no longer serves her purposes.", "THANK YOU. I am sick of people trying to tell me not to pass judgment based on one glimpse into their life. It\u2019s like, NO. I WILL pass judgment.\n\nI know for a FACT that if anyone ever posts about you on a reddit in a bad light, you\u2019re shitty. And if you ever impress someone enough for them to post about you in a good way, you\u2019re a hero every single day of your life.", "Good to see I am not the only one who picked up on this. I hope someone who is in a position to help the sister can make that help happen. \n\nOP cannot and should not be the one. You enjoy the new little family and focus on that vs the negativity coming from your sibling", "I wouldn\u2019t be so sure. I\u2019ve had friends who were close enough to be family that took *twenty years* to show their true colors\u2026and when it first happened, it absolutely felt just as \u201cout of the blue\u201d as what OP is describing. It took a couple years of therapy for me to slowly start piecing together all of the red flags that had been scattered about.\n\nAnd it was the same basic issue, too: this \u201csister\u201d of mine had assigned me a particular role, without my knowledge, and as soon as I started growing out of that role, all hell broke loose.", "I read MIL as mother-in-law and was very confused for a moment!", "Ohhhh that's a new one, I love it. I don't know why people get all excited about military insurance though...I used to work in the business office of a big radiology company, and like... Tricare just ain't that great.", "That was my exact point which I\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t convey well ha! I guarantee those children are not getting what they need, what a horrid situation to create. I feel awful for the life she\u2019s going to give them.", "Yeah, I feel the same about people who have, maybe, more than three kids. Especially back to back, like I\u2019ve seen. Even if the kids aren\u2019t hurting for essentials, I can\u2019t imagine they\u2019re getting the attention they need. Especially when the oldest starts having to help take care of the younger ones. I know a couple who are pregnant with their sixth child, after having their fifth just over a year ago, and even the grandparents told them they need to start wrapping it up. But they want more! They\u2019re well off and can afford it, but three of their children are currently babies and the father does the bare minimum. It\u2019s nuts.", "And to one up what she thought was an infertile sister it seems. Poor children.", "I had several friends like this and was so confused and hurt when they got hostile suddenly", "I don't like putting down people for being fat, or being housewives. I understand that it used to be a rule that officer's wife DID NOT work! They had social obligations! - they were expected to entertain constantly.  I did work with an officer's wife in DC because it was understood that it was so expensive to live there that they needed an extra income.  On the other hand . . . \n\nMy brother was an Air Force officer.  He said that a general came in to his base to talk to the wives, and they were all arranged by their husband's rank.  The general said \"I don't know who you women think you are, but you're not officers, and you're not in the service!\"  And walked out.  \n\nHe also said that one colonel's wife came into the clinic (that's not what they call it) with a minor ailment, and demanded to be seen before a private's wife who was actually in labor.   One of the orderlies swore at the colonel's wife, but he didn't get punished, probably because the colonel was too embarrassed.\n\nHe also said, and this is what I thought maybe the term meant, that when a husband had an assignment where he couldn't take his family, the men on the base of course helped out his family.  My brother said that some women were constantly demanding help with every little thing, like changing light bulbs, and others managed by themselves.", "All I care about is saving money", "If you are legally married, you are absolutely entitled to the discount. Your pocket is his pocket.", "I couldn't do the spousal support group shit, because all of the other wives and girlfriends looked down on me for having my own career. They ganged up on me for not being the \"right type of supportive\" because I was \"so self-centered and only worried about myself\" because I was putting myself through college and working in IT. It was just wild. I wasn't going to do the whole giving precedence to someone just because her husband has a higher rank than my fiance, but damn if that woman didn't treat all of the enlisted wives and girlfriends as slaves. \n\nI was so glad to move back home and aware from those women. It was like they never grew out of being the high school mean girls, and I just never got the point.", "Can I just suggest that you both just had a child and that your bodies are a Petrie dish of chemicals? She was definitely out of line. Your husband did the right thing- But. \n\nIf you two had a thriving relationship before this, isn\u2019t it possible you are both dealing with some significant life changes (and responsibilities) which are at best, an emotional rollercoaster. Her outburst sounds like a meltdown sure- but it might also be a cry for help. \n\nLook, if it makes you feel better we\u2019ll name her TA- she was definitely doing some A-holely stuff. But if someone called my sister an A, you can believe I\u2019d have something to say about it (even if she was being a jerk)\u2026 and I think you might feel that way about your sister too. \n\nSo, maybe take a deep breath, call your sister and acknowledge that sh*t got weird (and even cruel) and find out what\u2019s really going on\u2026 and share what\u2019s really going on too.", "NTA. Your sister needs to shut her mouth and her legs.", "Truly. With 7 kids, she's held the spotlight plenty while you've helped out. Now, you have the focus for a change with a wonderful but difficult pregnancy, and she's jealous and embittered that she's not everyone's focus. I'm sorry, and it's painful, but it seems that part of your closeness was dependent upon what you could do for her.\n\nYour husband deserves credit for protecting you from her vitriol and attempts to steal your moment and joy. He was 100% correct for booting her. Your focus now is your own little family. Congratulations and enjoy.", "This thread really sees narcissists everwhere. If she has been there for OP and this is out of character for her, she's not a narcissist, there's other issues in play. \n\nOP should block her sister and tell her parents what happened, so if the sister has PPP, someone can get her some help.

I had two babies and owed nothing. Had three surgeries because of cancer. Owed nothing. Radiation. Owed nothing. It\u2019s not perfect but I feel pretty grateful it was all covered. Now that he\u2019s retired we feel lucky the premiums are low.  $700 annually. We could do my husbands employer plan but premiums would be $800 a month and far more out of pocket costs."]}
