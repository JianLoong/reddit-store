She gave birth to her seventh child only a few days before I gave birth to my only daughter. Maddy and I were always close. She was supportive when I was bullied in high school, she was a shoulder for me to cry on when an OB told me I would never be able to have children biologically, she was there when an ex broke my heart and she helped me talk through the conversation I had with my husband when we were dating about me not being able to have kids. I was also there for her. When she lost her best friend right out of high school, when her husband deployed overseas while he was in the military, when she had her first four babies and needed a birthing partner and her husband was overseas. When she needed a place to stay because her home was broken into. We were always very close as sisters and we were more than that, we were friends.\n\nThe joy when I learned I was pregnant was quickly erased when I started to have complications and I spent 99% of the time worried I had gotten so lucky and might not be able to have a healthy baby at the end of my pregnancy. My sister was not really supportive during this time. Our parents were though. They helped out while my husband worked (I had to leave my job because of my complicated pregnancy). They were so excited for me.\n\nMy parents were babysitting for my sister and her husband when she had her baby. And they waited at the hospital with me when I gave birth to my beautiful daughter. They helped by bringing my husband food and something to drink because he was stressed and worried and needed some support too. I was in the hospital for a week and when I was released I called my sister and she was short with me. I tried not to let it get to me and focused on my daughter. Then a couple of weeks passed and she showed up. This happened last week. My sister shows up and accuses me of undermining the joy of her child and saying I hogged our parents and wasn't there for her like I always was before. My husband told her to calm down. She told me how our parents did everything to cater to me and how they were coddling me and fawning all over me and my daughter and making a big fuss about her name and showering her with so much stuff when her little one didn't get the same. She told me I waited so long to have a baby and then saddle her with a shitty ass name that everyone will make fun of her for. Then she said I was selfish for getting pregnant when she was pregnant and I burst into tears. My husband lost it with my sister and told her to leave and not to come back. She was yelling at me asking how I could let him kick her out like that. And ever since she has been texting asking how I could allow him to treat her that way.\n\nI'm so upset at how bad our relationship has become. She was always my best friend and now she hates me for something amazing that happened to me. Or maybe for the reaction of others. I'm not even sure anymore.

Your sister was jealous she didn\u2019t have the spotlight and your husband saw right through her bullshit. Good for him. Good for you. If your sister could be so callous when she should\u2019ve been stoked, I don\u2019t think she saw you as closely tied as you might\u2019ve. \n\nConcentrate on your new little. Give your husband a pat on the back. Give yourself space to grieve this hurt. I know this sucks right now, but I promise you\u2019re in the best hands because they\u2019ve already protected you.

This was your first and there were complications.  She was out of line and sounds like a narcissist", "She had 6 opportunities to be showered and suddenly she needs all the attention? NTA, even more so that you we\u2019re having complications", "Sounds like your sister loved having you at her whim, and probably never had any intention of reciprocating. Most people who have kids know the first in a nuclear family is usually a bigger deal than the 7th in the same (especially regarding fertility issues, congratulations OP!!). You talk about being there for her the whole time she was having children; though for your *first* she couldn\u2019t consider you at all, and had the gall to accuse you of being selfish? NTA, your sister is having some projection issues. Maybe she\u2019s had it rough, but that doesn\u2019t mean YOU are being selfish for trying to care about your own family now.", "NTA at all and congratulations on your beautiful new addition to your family and having a supportive partner! \n\nShe CLEARLY believed she held a special spot in your family due to her seemingly endless fertility. You have changed that. There is zero doubt in my mind that she truly believed her children would be your only children and that you would be back up parents for life. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to undermine your relationship with your sister , but I would take a good, long, objective look at how the cards have actually been being dealt\u2026 was she really there to support you? Or were you just the golden goose?", "NTA- your sister was only there for you because she likes feeling \u201cabove\u201d you . You being in distress makes her feel like she\u2019s got it better than you .\n\nNow that you have a kid and your parents are paying attention to her she\u2019s mad that she\u2019s not getting all the attention .\n\nDon\u2019t let her emotionally manipulate you by starting shit with your husband. \n\nThink about it, if she gets you to leave your husband for disrespecting her, then you will once again be in a worse situation than her , and then she can go back to feeling like she has it better than you.\n\nJust go no contact until she apologizes becaue I promise she will give you and ultimatum trying to make you choose between her and your husband.", "NTA It sounds like your sister was used to having all eyes on her and her children. Now, she's being selfish and jealous about sharing that attention. It's especially awful knowing what a gift your baby is for you. Of course, your parents are excited for and supportive of you and your husband. Your sister should be, too.", "NTA - OP, I am so sorry. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s under a lot of pressure with that many kids and a husband who is frequently gone, and she may be having a hard time with hormones and even PPD. However, she knew her situation with her husband, and she knew she already had six kids. If she is stressed, she\u2019s also chosen to directly contribute to it by having another child. She can\u2019t expect everyone to treat her, on her seventh child, the same way they would treat you, your first pregnancy with higher risk for complications.\n\nYou needed support in this time, it was your first pregnancy and it was very high-risk. There is no world in which you\u2019re the AH here. Your sister was very out of line with everything she said, and it seems like she said every vicious thing she could think of just to hurt you. She owes you an apology and your husband did right by removing her from the situation.", "Wow. So she thought she should be able to just attack you without interruption? And now she's blaming you for allowing your husband to interrupt?\n\nShe had SIX kids before this, and I'm sure your parents gave her plenty of attention then.\n\nShe could probably let you have the spotlight for your one.\n\nNTA.", "NTA ...your sister has 7 kids.....you finally had ONE after thinking you couldn't....and she's mad because your getting all the attention?   YOU deserve every bit of attention right now!!!!.... and your hubby sounds like a keeper.", "So... you were living your life under the assumption that you could NEVER get pregnant, when suddenly you did. I'm guessing completely unexpected (though very wanted!). So due to this miracle - again, unexpected - she thinks you're selfish? Because she was already pregnant, for the 7th time? It sounds like your sister has \"main character syndrome\" (which I know isn't actually a medical diagnosis). Sometimes, the people we love the most can also hurt us the most, and it's clear your sister did exactly that-  I'm glad your husband had your back, and was willing to remove the obvious source of stress for you. NTA, and congratulations on your baby!", "NTA\n\nYour husband did the right thing and you shouldn't feel guilty for letting him handle it. Your sister got used to being the center of attention when it came to the kids. It's extremely unfortunate that she's not able to see how disgusting she's acting right now.\n\nMy advice, don't respond to her at all until it's an apology. When she apologizes, take that time to let her know how deeply hurt you are that through everything you've both been through, this one thing that she got to experience 7 times, you only get to experience once and that's considered lucky, she made it about her.\n\nI know you're really upset, but don't let her ridiculousness put a hamper on something so amazing! Congrats on your little one!!", "Nta.  Your sister deserved it.  What an ungrateful person.", "NTA. She was antagonizing and harassing you, so she got what she deserved.", "Holy shit NTA - I\u2019m glad you have a supportive husband who stood up for you", "NTA. It sounds like she (subconsciously?) enjoyed being the sister who could provide your parents with grandchildren. Your being pregnant changed all of that. I\u2019m sorry that this is putting a shadow over what should be a wonderful time in your life. Please just enjoy your daughter and give yourself the space YOU need.", "Time to go low contact. Her behaviour is abhorrent.", "OMG, no, you are soooo NTA and I am so proud of your husband for sticking up to you like that.  I have no idea what's wrong with your sister, but it is without a doubt not your fault.", "NTA. Sounds like your hubby is a great guy. 7 kids? Holy sh--.", "NTA. Your sister was terrible towards you for all sorts of messed up reasons. Your husband did the right thing.\n\nYou should go no contact with her until she realizes how wrong she was and works to make amends. You're not obligated to talk to her ever again, but that would be the bare minimum for having her be in your life.", "Nta at all your sister needs some chill time i wouldnt talk to her again until she grows up and says she sorry", "NTA.  She is behaving like a bully and your husband did what he should, protect his family.  She may have been really close to you and you may need to be the one to tell her that she is now your bully and you won\u2019t let her insult you or your family.  It hurts because you expected more from her but it seems like she is taking out her frustration with your parent\u2019s lack of attention on you.  Newsflash:  they\u2019re adults.  They can decide where they want to be.  Don\u2019t let her toxic ass ruin your joy of a baby.", "NTA\n\nSounds like sister is VERY jealous of the fact that you have some attention.  You thought you'd never be able to have a child so she was able to have all the attention.  Suddenly, you have a baby yourself, and now she has to share the attention.\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss.  It is OK to grieve the relationship that has essentially ended.\n\nCongrats on the new baby!", "NTA. First, CONGRATULATIONS on your baby!!!!!!!  How wonderful for you, hubby and family. \n\nSecond:  Your sister is JEALOUS. That\u2019s all it is. She\u2019s butthurt for stupid reasons. Block her and don\u2019t think about it. Concentrate on your baby, enjoy life. If sister wants to be an ass, let her, you just don\u2019t have to watch it/hear it.", "NTA. Your sister is a baby making machine who got used to being the center of attention.\n\nYou've had one complicated pregnancy and one child -- a child you never thought you would be able to have. Of course your family has been concerned about you and is celebrating your one and only child more excitedly than your sister's seventh. And of course you \"weren't there for her\" while you were dealing with your own difficult pregnancy.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Your husband did nothing wrong. Your sister expects to the be main character in your story, too, not just hers.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you had a great relationship with your sister but your sister's relationship with you is entirely dependent on you being available 24/7 for her. Now she sees you as competition for her and her true self is hanging out there for all to see.\n\nFocus on your own family and be as happy as you feel. Congratulations!", "NTA.\n\nSounds like your sister is having a tough time accepting that your parents probably won't be caretakers for her 7th child.", "NTA. Your sister is definitely TA. Maybe her emotions need to be sorted out, maybe she's dealing with a little postpartum stuff, but she was way out of line. She clearly has had no problem having children. You have. You had a frightening and complicated pregnancy and this was your 1st child. Maybe your only child. Why on Earth would she suggest that you shouldn't have gotten pregnant? She is being more than thoughtless. Your parents have done the right thing supporting you.  And so did your husband. Your sister owes you a very big apology and maybe she will eventually see that", "NTA- your sister is showing her true colors now that she has realized she is in fact not the main character. Enjoy your beautiful daughter!", "NTA. She should\u2019ve SUPPORTED you through this scary time, just as you supported her for years. You didn\u2019t made her feel bad for you not being able to have children - how dare she berate you for taking a modicum of attention for ONE baby?! \n\nTake care of yourself and enjoy your baby!", "Your sister is a jealous asshole. She is on child seven. How do you plan conception around that? Even if you just got lucky.\n\nOf course your parents made a fuss because you were a high risk pregnancy and it was your first. It's all new and you need support. What a vile way to carry on. \n\nNTA", "Your husband did what any good husband would do and that was to show your sister the door. Congratulations to you both on your little one. Take care. NTA.", "NTA obviously,  sounds like sister is jealous she is no longer the only one having kids.", "Seven kids!!  That\u2019s just selfish and nobody cares anymore.", "NTA. And your husband for sh\\*t sure is NTA. Your sister was being ridiculous. Do not feel guilty for this.", "Nta. Your sister sounds selfish af. I'd go low contact for a while. Step back and enjoy your family. You worked hard for it. Yay for husband for getting her out! \nCongratulations for baby!", "NTA. This relationship is not at all what you think. I'm sorry.", "NTA sorry to say it but it sounds like she'd prefer it if you weren't able to have kids", "NTA - your sister is a selfish nightmare. Your husband is a hero as are your parents.", "NTA and your sister sounds jealous and terrible. Your husband is a great guy", "It sounds like your sister was used to being the centre of everyone\u2019s universe. When it was about you it was ok because you were discussing issues that made her feel superior to you. (You 0 kids and struggling to have 1, her with her brood)\n\nThe moment it was about you in a joyous happy way she flipped her lid. She is not happy for you. I would go NC.", "It\u2019s sounds to me that the weight of seven kids will feel a little heavier to your sister now that you\u2019ll be less available for her to lean on as you\u2019re a new mother. In addition, the fact that your parents wanted to be there for you at around the same time she expected them to be helping her, has apparently upset her. \n\nI don\u2019t want to go right to a dark place, but it seems like she\u2019s super pissed that she lost you as a helper and will now have to share your parents as they will want to split their grandparent time between you now. The dramatic change in your relationship lines up with your pregnancy. She either was happy being the only one with kids and hates you stealing her spotlight or she really thought she\u2019d always have multiple extra adults around to help with her parenting needs. \n\nCongratulations on finally becoming a mom and happy Mother\u2019s Day! NTA", "INFO - Was there a history of her feeling neglected by your parents because of you, or is this the only time something like this has ever been mentioned? Also, it\u2019s unclear how much time passes between your two pregnancies?", "NTA at all. There\u2019s a 1% chance your sister has some sort of PPD or PPA-it can come on before birth-and that would explain her sudden shift. So if this is TRULY unlike her, see if you can talk to her when things have calmed down. If she continues to double down, grieve this loss of a close sister without feeling guilty. Do not for ONE MINUTE let her feel bad about you or your baby. You didn\u2019t demand anything; your family was there for you in ways you needed and they did NOT neglect your sister and her seventh child.", "NTA for sure, in my opinion your sister thought that you\u2019ll going to support her all the time and once you become pregnant and your parents and husband begin to support you because it\u2019s really important for you so your sister didn\u2019t have that much support as she expected and she became mad at you. I think after some time your relations with your sister will be good \ud83d\ude42 hope you and your child are ok \ud83d\ude42", "I'm gunna say a tentative NSH. From what you say you and you're sister have always been very close and supportive of each other... so this is completely out of character. Both of you have just had a baby, so emotions and hormones will be all over the place. You're sister has behaved badly, but this isn't normal behaviour for her. I'm making assumptions but I'd guess that as yours was a complicated pregnancy you've probably, and understandably, been focused on that for several months.\n\nMaybe there's something else going on here, is she having marital issues, was her husband able to be there for her during pregnancy and birth or did his work prevent this? You've done nothing wrong, and I get how hurtful this situation is. But it seems you two were extremely close, she's never behaved like this before... if it was me I'd try and look deeper.\n\nPeople are so quick here to say cut her off, go low contact, but this sounds like an important relationship to you which is worth saving. Maybe she's just feeling overwhelmed and struggling in general and is lashing out at you. Maybe reach out and say even though what she's said and how she acted really hurt you, you sense that she's feeling hurt and unheard too and you want to be able to be there for each other. See if she takes a breath and opens up a bit in response.\n\nThe priority is take care of yourself, but it seems like this relationship is worth the effort to you. Good luck", "I'm wondering if post natal depression explains the sisters unwonted behaviour.", "NAH seems that stress and pregnancy hormonal changes, has caused stress to get everyone on edge.

Your Husband sounds amazing.\n\nCongratulations on your baby, don\u2019t let your sisters negativity ruin this moment for you.  \n\nHappy mothers Day .", "She might be having problems with pregnancy and post pregnancy hormones.  With that many kids, her gas tank might be low.  Get in touch with her husband and see what he says.  If this is unusual behavior from her it might be a post partum thing that her doctor needs to know about.", "I love how pregnancy removes accountability on anything a woman can do and infantilise her to no end on this sub.", "Right, nothing you did justified her reaction. Nothing she\u2019s gone through justifies her reaction. You sound like a great sister, but somewhere down the line she started feeling entitled to being the center of attention and viewed you as her personal cheerleader without needs of your own. That\u2019s a really hard thing to deal with, and *maybe* it can reconcilable after a lot of time and effort on her part, but right now, please don\u2019t feel bad about doing what\u2019s best for you, your husband, and your baby. This should be such a happy time for you! It\u2019s selfish of your sister to try to take that away.\n\nCongratulations on your little miracle.", "She's not just angry with you, OP.  She hates you.  Maybe it will change in the future, but right now, she hates you.  It's probably best for everyone if you end contact with her altogether until she can behave in a civil manner toward you.", "DANG. Fixed, thanks.", "Well, I know that right now it hurts. I've had similar pain in my own life. Just remember - you'll get through it, absolutely. Your sweet little baby will 100% help with that (again, congrats!). And also, give it some time. Then try to have a conversation where you lay it all out. Let her know it hurt, let her know that you still love her and alway will, but also let her know that you will NEVER apologize for being crushed when your sister turned her back on you at such a crucial time. Lots of love from this random redditor!", "If this is out of character for her, it's possible she developed prenatal anxiety or depression (or both, like I did with my 4th... It sucked a lot). We talk more about PPD than we used to, but PPA and prenatal anxiety and depression aren't as well known, and if she was/is struggling while still trying to parent her other 6, her current behavior may be a result of that, not an actual personality shift. Definitely NTA, no matter what, just something to consider. And congratulations on your little one!", "Maybe they're having marital problems now due to spending more time together. Happens sometimes. Maybe even though he's been home he still wasn't much help during pregnancy and she's seen how attentive your husband is which has made her feel worse.\n\nLike I said this is all speculation, and you have definitely not done anything wrong. I'm just basing this on the fact its out of character and you love each other so much. You have to do what's best for you, but if its important to you it may be worth finding out if something else is going on and you can work through this. I really hope you can resolve everything and both enjoy your new babies xx", "That's exactly the point.... This only started when you got pregnant- and she was also pregnant at the same time and likely looking forward to the same support and attention she had always gotten before, and then the rug was ripped out from underneath her. She reacted poorly to that disappointment. She's entirely out of line here, and you did nothing wrong, but as the other commenter said... This relationship has meant a lot to you for a very long time. It might be worth trying to repair once you both recover from your stressful experiences.", "Possibly, it was just a thought looking at possible explanations. I didn't feel in a position to make an AH call.", "The sister has a husband.  The parents were babysitting for the sister and her husband when she went into labor.", "They\u2019re called \u201cdependapotomus\u201d for a reason.", "This too.", "The sister believed OP was inferior to her and OP getting pregnant and having a healthy baby dispelled that belief.", "Yep.  This was my first thought too.  Did he retire at the same time you both got pregnant?  It\u2019s a big transition to go through when you\u2019re suddenly together All The Time.  And she\u2019s pregnant.  Definitely absolutely NOT excusing her words - she was 100% wrong - just saying there may be an underlying reason she\u2019s acting that way, and it\u2019s nothing at all to do with you.  \n\n\nTake this time to be with your miracle.  Give her time to recover from own childbirth.  See what happens.  Hopefully she\u2019ll realize she was a complete AH and apologize.  You have a whole life history of her support\u2014I\u2019m guessing she will apologize and mean it.  But for now, I would just focus on your family of 3 for a while.  You don\u2019t need the drama.  \n\n\nIf she reaches out, be honest: \u201cYou really hurt me with your words and how selfish you were.  Right now I\u2019m focusing on time with (baby) and (husband).  You and I need some time apart.\u201d\n\n\nCongratulations and good luck!  I hope you and your sister heal your relationship but that\u2019s not a priority for you right now.", "Is that actually a used term or did you just make it up? Either way, what a fitting term.", "Nope, that's what they're called. Dependas who are extra large are dependapotamuses.\n\nEdit spelling and it's probably still wrong"]}
