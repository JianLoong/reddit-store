It was just a book that I sort of felt like giving a read, but that's not really relevant. The store I was in is a local business and very small, it's not like one of them huge thrift stores with rows and rows of shelves. It has a much smaller stock and some pretty niche stuff. It was pretty busy that day and given the small size of the store, a little cramped. There were probably about 8 people in there not including the staff.\n\nI knew what I had went in for, and where it was located, so I went over to the shelf, picked up the book and bought it at the till. There's two sort of aisles of shelves between the checkout and the doors, one of which was blocked by a family of three browsing ornaments and crockery. The other aisle was thinner but only had one man in the way, who was on the phone. I decided that trying to squeeze past shelves of glassware was not a good idea, so I went to walk past the man on the phone but he was standing right in the middle, leaving little space on either side. Not wanting to interrupt his phone call, I stood for about 20 seconds behind him and waited for him to move and let me past but he just stayed standing in the way on his phone. He looked at me and I sort of gestured with my hand towards the door and mouthed \"Could I get past?\" but he didn't even acknowledge me, which I thought was a little rude.\n\nBy this point another lady had paid for her items and was now standing behind me waiting to get to the door. I'm a little awkward in social situations and didn't want to hold anyone up, so I politely said \"excuse me\" to the guy blocking the way. He then put his hand up splayed as if to hush me and told me to \"Shut up\" because he was doing an interview. I was pretty taken aback and honestly rather upset about how he spoke to me because I'd already had a bad day.\n\nThe lady behind me then made an offhand comment about how people have no manners, and so I agreed with her to which she replied that she meant I was the rude one by interrupting someone on the phone. According to her, I should have just waited until he was done because there's \"no rush\".\n\nI sort of just gave her a raised eyebrow before walking past the man (who had now moved to one side) and out the store.\n\nI honestly didn't think I'd done anything wrong because why would you decide to take an important phone call in the middle of a busy public place, and then stand right in the middle of where people need to walk? He could've stepped outside, or gone to a quieter corner of the store IMHO, or better yet just done the interview at home. When I told my friend about what happened, she too thought both the man and the lady were pretty unreasonable but now I'm thinking it over and I feel like maybe I was TA. I could tell from what the guy was saying on the phone that it was some sort of business-related call, so maybe I should have just waited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671084978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmdzyj/aita_for_interrupting_someones_job_interview/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Is it really so difficult to move out of the way? No, it is not. There is no need to make people wait for your call to end. Just move out of the freaking way!!

Luckily I was in my home.).  IF this was the case he should have stepped outside or to a more private and out of the way location to continue the interview rather than in the middle of a walkway.  \n\nNow down to the actual incident.
