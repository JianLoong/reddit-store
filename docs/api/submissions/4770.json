It was just a book that I sort of felt like giving a read, but that's not really relevant. The store I was in is a local business and very small, it's not like one of them huge thrift stores with rows and rows of shelves. It has a much smaller stock and some pretty niche stuff. It was pretty busy that day and given the small size of the store, a little cramped. There were probably about 8 people in there not including the staff.\n\nI knew what I had went in for, and where it was located, so I went over to the shelf, picked up the book and bought it at the till. There's two sort of aisles of shelves between the checkout and the doors, one of which was blocked by a family of three browsing ornaments and crockery. The other aisle was thinner but only had one man in the way, who was on the phone. I decided that trying to squeeze past shelves of glassware was not a good idea, so I went to walk past the man on the phone but he was standing right in the middle, leaving little space on either side. Not wanting to interrupt his phone call, I stood for about 20 seconds behind him and waited for him to move and let me past but he just stayed standing in the way on his phone. He looked at me and I sort of gestured with my hand towards the door and mouthed \"Could I get past?\" but he didn't even acknowledge me, which I thought was a little rude.\n\nBy this point another lady had paid for her items and was now standing behind me waiting to get to the door. I'm a little awkward in social situations and didn't want to hold anyone up, so I politely said \"excuse me\" to the guy blocking the way. He then put his hand up splayed as if to hush me and told me to \"Shut up\" because he was doing an interview. I was pretty taken aback and honestly rather upset about how he spoke to me because I'd already had a bad day.\n\nThe lady behind me then made an offhand comment about how people have no manners, and so I agreed with her to which she replied that she meant I was the rude one by interrupting someone on the phone. According to her, I should have just waited until he was done because there's \"no rush\".\n\nI sort of just gave her a raised eyebrow before walking past the man (who had now moved to one side) and out the store.\n\nI honestly didn't think I'd done anything wrong because why would you decide to take an important phone call in the middle of a busy public place, and then stand right in the middle of where people need to walk? He could've stepped outside, or gone to a quieter corner of the store IMHO, or better yet just done the interview at home. When I told my friend about what happened, she too thought both the man and the lady were pretty unreasonable but now I'm thinking it over and I feel like maybe I was TA. I could tell from what the guy was saying on the phone that it was some sort of business-related call, so maybe I should have just waited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671084978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmdzyj/aita_for_interrupting_someones_job_interview/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please. Stop with the blocking thoroughfares.

No manners - just me me me.", "NTA\n\nWho TF takes a call right in front of a doorway and just stands there?? That guy was super rude and inconsiderate and the woman was ridiculous to think others should wait just because you\u2019re on your phone in public.", "NTA. If the guy had a call that couldn't be interrupted, he should absolutely take it to a more private place. If your phone call is interfering with normal business operations, you're being rude. His call clearly was. \n\nHow the hell does this woman know what you have on your plate? That's a pretty bizarre comment and you were not out of line for saying excuse me to someone.", "NTA. Should of just bull rushed your way through him after he pretended you didn\u2019t exist.", "NTA. Guy could've moved aside without the extra \"wait a minute\" gesture. It's not rocket science that you needed to get passed him. The lady behind you obviously had no idea how long you were actually standing there or what the situation actually was. \n\nAlso, while it is generally rude to interrupt someone speaking on the phone, there are situations where it is called for. You tried gestures and he didn't budge so the next logical step is actually speaking. I would've done the same as you and if he didn't budge with speaking then I would've pushed my way through. That's what happens when you hog an aisle.", "NTA - I hate rude people who are on the phone in stores. I agree that he should have taken the call in a more private setting.  Is it really so difficult to move out of the way? No, it is not. There is no need to make people wait for your call to end. Just move out of the freaking way!! Also, hang up the phone before you get to the cashier. Standing there talking with your finger up telling the cashier to wait is completely ridiculous!!", "NTA. Why the heck is the guy doing a phone interview in the middle of a shop? Like, surely you would want to stand out of the way of anyone so you can focus on the interview?", "NTA\n\n\nIf I was a recruiter and the person went shopping whilst doing an interview, it would be an automatic no from me.

He could have gone outside or stood in a corner out of the way but instead he chose to be in the way.", "NTA!  He was totally in the wrong.  His \"interview\" on the phone should not have held up any other people from moving about in a public place of business!  He was blocking the doorway, and that was bad behavior on his part.
