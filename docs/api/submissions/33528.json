Ann is and always has been my mom's favorite. Growing up, my mom got Ann everything she wanted, whether it was new clothes, toys, electronics, her own bedroom (in a one bedroom apartment... I slept on the floor in the living room with mom), etc. We were poor, so sometimes my mom would borrow money, take out loans, hustle, or play her luck gambling to get her what she wanted. But if I were to ask for anything, I always got hit with the \"next time, we don't have the money.\" I was also denied certain experiences that my sister got to have. For example, I was not allowed to date or go to friends' houses or even walk to the store by myself. My mom rationalized this by saying she treated us differently because of our personalities, with my sister being the \"diva\" and me the \"quiet\" one.\n\nI've come to accept that she loves us differently and have moved on with my life. I now have a son of my own and my sister has two kids as well. For Christmas, we all planned to meet at my mom's house. My mom has also enlisted me to help with preparations, so I've been taking her to the store, setting up decorations, etc. I was helping her put the final touches on the tree recently and arranging the gifts when I noticed that Ann's kids had a lot more gifts than my son. Specifically, Ann's kids had about 12 gifts a piece, while my son had three. I made a comment about it and she said that since my son is small (he's four) he'll outgrow everything fast, both clothes and toys, so she didn't get him much.\n\nI let it go, but it still bothered me. My sister's kids are 8 and 6, which means they'll grow fast too, making her excuse a bit lame. I ended up asking her about it again, and she admitted that it was because Ann's kids are special. She said they were her \"heart and soul.\" I felt hurt by that but I thought maybe I was being too sensitive. I talked to my husband about it and he agreed it was hurtful and questioned whether we should go to my mom's for Christmas.\n\nI decided we won't go and called my mom to tell her. She got mad and said I was childish and needed to get over it because all grandmothers have their \"picks\" when it comes to grandchildren. She said she still loves my son and thinks I'll be hurting him by not letting him see her on Christmas. She's told Ann about it (and other people, vaguely, over Facebook), and Ann more or less said it's \"our problem\" and she's going to enjoy Christmas either way.", "created_utc": 1703215486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18o5b8o/aita_for_not_going_to_my_moms_house_for_christmas/", "score": 1416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother, AND your sister, are cruel. Hold onto your husband and your son for dear life and run from these evil people. Your son doesn\u2019t need a constant reminder that he\u2019s not grandma\u2019s favourite and grandma likes the other grandkids more. You are absolutely NTA. Protect your family and give them the love you never got from your mother.", "NTA. Especially when you explained it to her and allowed her to opportunity to reflect, and she doubled down with worse excuses? \n\nYou clearly care so much about your little one and want to protect him from the treatment you got growing up. My dad, unfortunately, was in the same position with his parents. I will never forget how important it was to me that my dad chose our happiness over his mother\u2019s poor treatment of us. Merry Christmas, OP.", "NTA - favoritism is unacceptable. As you unfortunately know very well, it\u2019s hurtful and children are well aware when it\u2019s going on. There are no excuses for it or even \u201cloving people differently\u201d - it\u2019s extremely harmful and you deserved better. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. If she can choose which grandkids she wants to give gifts and attention to, then your family can choose to enjoy Christmas where you feel loved and appreciated. I find it very unfortunate that Ann didn\u2019t come to your defense.", "Oof. NTA - tell your mother if your son and yourself are not special then she won\u2019t miss you anyway.\n\nAnd then tell your son his other grandmother is the special granny (assuming she\u2019s a better human than your mother).\n\nNo, it\u2019s not normal to be so overtly favouritist between a group of kids who are all the same degree of relative to you, even if you secretly have a favourite or two in your heart. That stuff should be a secret she takes to the grave, not something she uses to make her own child and grandchild feel and be treated as inferior. You and your child deserve so much better.", "NTA your mother has her golden child & golden grand-children. That much is blatantly obvious. Rather than perpetuating that dynamic over an additional generation, going LC to NC with your mother and your sister who fails to see the issue will be better for you and your kid as well. It\u2019s your job to make sure your child knows it is loved by the people around him, and doesn\u2019t spend his earliest formative years noticing how he\u2019s a second thought at best to his grandmother.", "NTA. My mom and my mil have more grandkids than just my daughter, and they all get equal treatment. I'm disgusted by this.  This seems toxic.", "NTA at all!  But both you mom and sister are major ones!!!  It is so sickening the way you mom is acting.  Your husband is right.  Don't go and subject your son to the kind of treatment you've endured your whole life.  Cut this toxic duo out of your life!", "NTA.\n\nYou are perfectly justified in feeling upset. This situation is horrible and you don't deserve this.\n\nI think you need to have a serious conversation with your mother about how her favouritism and that it's affected you, and that she needs to change if she wants an active part in your life.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. Your mother is treating your son less than his cousins and he will notice this. He'll grow up thinking he did something wrong. You are 100% correct to stand up for him. She knows she's wrong in all thing but will never admit to it.", "NTA. Your mother can pick her other grandchildren over your son, and you can pick your son over your mother. Maybe it's time for you and your husband to start your own family traditions.", "A friend of mine only went no contact with her narcissist parents when she realized they were treating her toddler son the same way they treated her. \n\nYou know what you need to do. NTA.", "NTA. I would have been devastated as a 4 year old if I noticed the other kids got way more gifts from Grandma than I did. You're protecting your child from that.  \n\nDoes she spend more time with the other grandkids so she feels more attached to them? Maybe that could explain why they are \"special\" in the grandparents eyes?", "NTA, golden child produces golden grandchildren, apparently\n\nETA please protect your son from feeling as unloved as you did.", "NTA. \n\nAnd no, not all grandparents do. And even if some do, they don\u2019t make it blatantly obvious. \n\nYour mother is a massive AH.", "NTA. and golden children don\u2019t usually do the heavy lifting when their parents age.

Your Mom will figure this out albeit too late.", "You've become dangerously desensitized to abuse - that you even question if you're the asshole for being \"bothered\" by this behavior.

Every grandchild knew he was her favourite.\n\nIt really upset me. Grandad soon put a stop to it.\n\nNone of the grandkids liked her when we become adults.\n \nShe would goo to play bingo every Wednesday night. That night lots of my cousins including me would turn up and spend time with grandad", "She literally said she had a favorite, you're literally not supposed to. But ok sure,", "NTA. Of course Ann will enjoy it, she'll be even more the center of attention and it's easier to complain about you when you aren't there.", "NOPE. As someone who grew up with extended family always picking favourites, do not let your child endure this. Your son will be more hurt attending Christmas at your mums than he will be by missing it! Not only will his grandma make it obvious she loves the other grandkids more via presents but it\u2019ll also be obvious via treatments. Kids pick up on these things and they rarely forget. \n\nPeople will always remember how you made them feel, you and your son deserve a better Christmas at home with each other and your husband. It may not be as \u201cbig\u201d but it will be filled with love and laughter.", "Nope, it's time to cut ties. Lean in to your husband's parents for the grandparent experience for your son and just let that relationship wither because it's not worth the pain of upkeep. NTA.", "NTA. Please cut contact with your toxic family. Your son will be better off without them and even at 4 will realize he's being treated differently. Absolutely disgusting behavior to treat an innocent child differently.", "NTA. You're actively preventing your son being hurt the way you were. Being 4 is more than old enough to look at the presents and realise that grandma loves your cousins more than you.\n\nYour mom is just annoyed that she doesn't get to keep favouring Ann while getting everything she wants with no consequences. No way, let her lose this time.", "NTA. Do not subject your son to this wicked madness! Is he supposed to sit content with his 3 packages while his cousin opens a dozen? No. Just have a nice Christmas at home, you your son and your husband.", " NTA. You and your family are special. Cut her off.", "NTA and for the sake of your child please no more visits with grandma until she can learn to treat everyone equally. As a grandkid who was not \u201cthe chosen one\u201d it sucks. And your kid will start to notice it and asks what\u2019s wrong with him that he\u2019s not good enough. Protect your child.", "NTA. It\u2019s time to take this stand. Enjoy a beautiful holiday with your husband and son, and make him feel as special as he is! Let\u2019s be real, sometimes people do prefer certain children for various reasons. That\u2019s human. But what is not at all acceptable is treating children differently! That\u2019s not at all normal, and not at all acceptable.", "NTA. She\u2019s a cruel person to say, and do this. Kids are smart. They WILL see the favoritism, and it will hurt them. Good on you to keep your child from this type of toxic BS.", "*My mom has also enlisted me to help with preparations, so I've been taking her to the store, setting up decorations, etc. She got mad and said I was childish and needed to get over it because all grandmothers have their \"picks\" when it comes to grandchildren.

Grandma isn't going to change now.", "NTA cut them both off now and don\u2019t look bad or have second thoughts you put up with it your whole life when you didn\u2019t deserve it and too hell with your moms feelings and ego protect your son at all costs and don\u2019t let him feel what you felt", "Holy cow!!! I had a grandmother who had favorites. My dad's mom. My dad would never force us to spend time with her but our mom would. It's soul crushing to realize your grandmother doesn't really care about you. \nI am now the grandmother of 4. I treat them differently based on age but equally! I love them as the individuals they are. But I would NEVER want to cause them any pain in thinking that I love them less. \nTime to cut mom and sister off. It will only get worse. \nNTA but your mom and sister are.", ">She said they were her \"heart and soul.\"\n\nI just want to add to the chorus of voices assuring you that this is incredibly, incredibly fucked up, and not normal, and I would absolutely cut anyone out who said something similar about my children. Like *entirely* cut out.\n\nNTA. You've been conditioned to accept far less than you deserve, but the good news is that you are capable of breaking that cycle.", "NTA. Don't let her do to your child what she's done to you for all these years. And what she's still doing to you! What a sick thing to blatantly tell one of your children that their child is cared about less than the other grandkids. \n\nHave a fun, cozy Christmas with your husband and son. You all deserve to be with the people who truly love you.", "NTA. People can have favorites. But they shouldn\u2019t openly show favoritism. This is really gross behavior from your mom. And of course your sister is indifferent-she\u2019s been raised to believe favoritism is ok. Don\u2019t go and enjoy your Christmas.", "The fact that you are asking is sad because it means you do not see how outrageously you were treated. Honestly, you may be the A for ever letting this woman close to your child. She will harm him, even if in subtle ways she will.", "NTA- Your mom has picked her special child and grandchildren. I don\u2019t think you owe her any more of your time or help if she can\u2019t find it in herself to treat you, and your son, equally to how she treats the others. \n\nYou know how it felt to grow up in the shadow of your sister. Now you have a chance to spare your child from feeling like he is less than his aunt and cousins. It\u2019s time to protect your child from the callous nature of your family.", "NTA\n\nShe is horrible. A good grandparent, if they had a \"pick,\" would keep it to theirself. She felt comfortable telling you your son is less than. He isn't her pick or her heart and soul. He will see that and feel that. Save him from her.\n\nYou'll have a much better time with whatever you and husband decide. It is always better to leave the weight behind and live happily your way. You won't miss them, but you will probably live rent-free in their heads. Usually, people like this need to put others down to make theirself feel better. Think of them like the Jenga game. As each piece is removed, so goes the stability.", "NTA\n\nThis is so out of line. I'm really sorry she's doing this *again*, after already being so hurtful to you.\n\nI'm just gonna say... I'm childless, but not by choice. My husband and I have fur kids, and that will have to do. My sister has one, gorgeous, amazing, brilliant two year old. One of my mom's first comments to me when I arrived for Christmas this year was that she was afraid she had purchased our 7 mo old golden retriever a toy that I had already bought. I know my niece will get the real gifts, as she should, but the first thing I heard about gifts was for my love, our puppy.\n\nIf my mom can buy gifts for her grand-dog, your mom can do a HELL of a lot better. Maybe some time with no contact with you or your child will help her prioritize. Maybe it won't. Either way you will have protected your son from seeing this painful preference game play out on Christmas, and that's a win. Don't force him to go through the same thing you did. You both deserve better.", "NTA.  Protect your son from the hurt you know he will be caused.  You and your husband are making the right choice.", "NTA - please keep your son as far away from this as possible. It\u2019s noticed and it\u2019s noticed very young.", "Your mother is terrible.\n\nI am a grandmother.  My grandson has a sister who is not my granddaughter. I am giving each child very similar gifts and the same number of gifts. \n\nNTA.  You are doing the right thing and may find you will need to go low or no contact with her.", "NTA. The only way you\u2019re TA is if you subject your 4 year old to blatant favoritism on Christmas. You should be LC with your mother minimum. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be around your LO. He will notice. My 4 year old knows her \u201cother gramma\u201d favors her cousin over her and her sister. She\u2019s known since she was barely 3. It\u2019s hard to explain to a kid why someone they love doesn\u2019t seem to love them as much as the person sitting next to them. We have a very LC relationship with MIL because of this.", "I am a grandmother and all the grandchildren have equal amount of gifts.", "You're NTA at all I don't blame y'all for not going. This might be an unpopular opinion but i'd distance myself more from your mom who's the cruel ah. Because your son will start picking up on his cousins being treated differently by your mom, which isn't good. Lots of kids pick up on that quick even much younger ones. I hope you, your son and husband have a very nice Christmas the three of you together.", "NTA.  Do not let your son be exposed to the same treatment you were by your mother.  He may not notice at 4 but by 5 or 6 he'll see how much more his cousins get from your mother than he gets.  Of course Ann isn't bothered by this, I'm sure she wasn't bothered when she got everything and you got the dregs.  Your son does not need a grandmother like this in his life.  You are not hurting him, you are protecting your son from a person who sees nothing wrong with playing favorites.  I'd seriously be considering cutting contact with your mother.", "NTA; don\u2019t subject your son, and any other kids you might have, to the same pain she\u2019s give  you with her favoritism.  Why do you continue to do it to yourself? Frankly, you should reply that you won\u2019t let her treat your son as second best, and refuse to let him grow up wondering why he\u2019s never good enough for her.", "NTA they can't show you loyalty they don't deserve you or your son\n\nETA your son is your family everyone else can earn y'alls love and trust", "NTA. Not being around a grandma who will treat him as less than will not hurt your son. Quite the opposite actually. I'd start seriously thinking about going no contact with them both (sister and mom). It seems like a toxic family situation to be in.", "NTA.\n\nMy grandmother was the kind with \u201cpicks.\u201d I was decidedly NOT one of those picks. The damage is lasting. I\u2019m nearing 40 and struggle with the things she said and did to me to this day. If my contact was limited with her, I might not be so bad, but she was the person who watched us when my mom travelled for work, about 10 days a month. It added up to a lot of damage.\n\nProtect your son. Please. He\u2019s old enough to start noticing things like his cousins having more presents.", "NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m so sorry, OP. Your mom and sister are just wrong.", "With family like that, who needs enemies. Nah. NTA. You don\u2019t need that kind of toxicity f/ing up your life and mental health.", "So normally I don't like when people suggest a nuclear option on these kinds of posts, but on this one I'd allow it. The way I see it, based on the info given, you have three choices.\n\n1. Accept that this is just the way it is, and continue to give your kids the chance to form their own opinions about your mother.\n\n2. Try and convince your mother that she is acting horribly, and will absolutely lead to your kids having a complex, constantly feeling like they aren't good enough, never achieving happiness because they will believe that their cousins are better, likely having serious emotional disorders. Maybe she will come around, but she sounds like a massive narcissist who will never admit wrongdoing.\n\n3. Mostly or entirely cut your mom and sister from your life. They simply don't care about you in the way that they should. They are both narcissists and don't care about your feelings or your child's feelings. This way, they don't have to deal with the constant bothering of expectations they will never meet. They won't deal with that nagging feeling of not being good enough for a grandmother who will never care about them as much as their cousins, and will only be met by the love and acceptance of their parents.", "NTA. Please protect your son. My mom plays favorites (I'm not it) and it trickled down to the grandkids. My kids are older now, but they know, they see it. I regret not protecting them from it better. I should have walked away a long time ago.", "NTA", "NTA  to be honest you'd be TA if you did go and subjected your son to that.", "I can tell you now, that your precious wee man will notice as he grows older. This is EXACTLY what happens with my kids. And it hurts. \nKeep LC and don't bother making Xmas or birthdays special where your mother is concerned. Avoid her during those times.

Love yourself and do not expose yourself to this treatment.", "NTA don\u2019t let them near your family!", "Oh, that is just unbelievably horrible of your mother.\n\nI definitely think you need to keep your son away from any event where he could perceive her favoritism.\n\nActually, even though I loathe how some Redditors advise going no contact at the drop of a hat, in this case it seems to me to be warranted.\n\nWhy should you continue to lay yourself open to being hurt? Why should you risk your son's hurt?\n\nNTA. I'm so sorry.", "NTA.  Your kid will grow up knowing grandma doesn\u2019t love him as much as his cousins.

Don't let your son go through the same. And your mother is revelling in the differential treatment she is meting out", "It\u2019s much better for the kid to be away from the shitty dynamic. Why grow up at the bottom of a big totem pole when he could be at the top of a smaller one", "NTA and honestly I would limit the amount of time I and my child spent with your mom and sister. It's pointless to want a relationship with someone who thinks you and your baby are less than. Go where y'all will be celebrated not tolerated.", "Just go No Contact and Low Contact, I feel you.", "NTA \n\nMy mother is pretty blatant about favoring my son (the eldest grandchild, and also the only boy) over the rest of her grandchildren, but she still treats them equally, buys them the same amount/quality of gifts, and things like that.", "NTA.

That is messed up. I'm really sorry OP. Nta. \nIt might be time to start going low contact. If she is the open with gifts, image what she will do if she ever has all three grandchildren on her on.

You\u2019ve become used to working for your mom\u2019s attention and she is taking advantage of it.  Do not maintain this relationship and expose your son to it.  Stay home, build your own traditions with a family who loves you.  Go LC with your mom and sister.  It\u2019s time to grow a shiny spine.", "NTA. Don\u2019t let this women make another generation suffer.", "NTA I was my grandmas \"pick\". I was her only granddaughter in a family of boys, so I was her favorite. But you know what she didn't do? She didn't flaunt that in front of the other kids. They got to visit her and we all got the same amount of money spent on gifts. (I say it that way because for older kids, gifts get to be more expensive so the older ones might only have 2 gifts, but the same amount was spent on those 2 gifts as the 5 gifts the younger kids got)\n\nI would stay home and make your own Christmas tradition.", "NTA", "You don't argue with parents about their golden child, you just cut them off.

That she treated you and your sister differently as kids, that sucks and is a whole different level of abuse but to then extend that to her grandchildren.

Since she does feel that way and doesn\u2019t mind saying it then I would be just as blunt:  \u201c\n\u201cPlaying favorites as a Mother hurt me. That was one thing. Now you really think I am going to let you treat my kids that way too?  Let me tell you that from now on I play favorites too for myself and my kid/s. You aren\u2019t even in the top 20. You and sis enjoy each other because you have both seen the last of me and mine.  And Merry Christmas because you have truly given me a gift, freedom from you.\u201d", "Wow... yeah... Honestly I'm not surprised that took a bit to process and realize how bad that was. That's horrifying and I think you're right for not wanting to participate in that. If she ever wants to have a relationship with you and your son she needs to treat him as special too. Thats horrible and kids notice that. I don't think you should feel obligated to subject yourself or your son to this. Christmas is supposed to be nice and special for everybody. It's pretty messed up to openly play favorites like that. I mean thats rather extreme too. Like she put on this big magical christmas for them and then your son was an afterthought. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going through something similar myself where it sounds like you put in a lot of effort to be available, participate, and help out, and you and yours are just not getting your due respect. In my case I'm done with it. I'm going this year to avoid a big thing but im putting the hammer down right after and making it clear that if anyone wants me to slave away making food and spending my holiday with them then they have to put in the effort to make the day decent for me too.", "NTA. My grandparents on my dad's side were like this. They liked my cousins more because they were the kids of the daughters and son they liked the best, so they were always treated the best. My grandparents didn't like my dad and hated my mom, so it trickled down to the four of us kids. One year for Christmas, the cousins got fancy Barbie dolls and Barbie Dream Houses. We (my brother, sisters, and I) got Bubble Tape gum (my brother), a hairbrush (my oldest sister), a dollar store fashion doll that had a missing arm (my middle sister, who was 16 at the time and past the doll age), and I got a broken thrift store circus car with a stained giraffe.  Needless to say that was the last Christmas we spent with them.", "NTA \n\nTime to set a boundary here and stick to it. Your mother's insane favoritism has to stop or she has no right to be in your life.", "NTA why would you want you and your son to be around somebody who doesnt think he matters as much as the other kids.

Ann is and always has been my mom's favorite. Growing up, my mom got Ann everything she wanted, whether it was new clothes, toys, electronics, her own bedroom (in a one bedroom apartment... I slept on the floor in the living room with mom), etc. We were poor, so sometimes my mom would borrow money, take out loans, hustle, or play her luck gambling to get her what she wanted. But if I were to ask for anything, I always got hit with the \"next time, we don't have the money.\" I was also denied certain experiences that my sister got to have. For example, I was not allowed to date or go to friends' houses or even walk to the store by myself. My mom rationalized this by saying she treated us differently because of our personalities, with my sister being the \"diva\" and me the \"quiet\" one.\n\nI've come to accept that she loves us differently and have moved on with my life. I now have a son of my own and my sister has two kids as well. For Christmas, we all planned to meet at my mom's house. My mom has also enlisted me to help with preparations, so I've been taking her to the store, setting up decorations, etc. I was helping her put the final touches on the tree recently and arranging the gifts when I noticed that Ann's kids had a lot more gifts than my son. Specifically, Ann's kids had about 12 gifts a piece, while my son had three. I made a comment about it and she said that since my son is small (he's four) he'll outgrow everything fast, both clothes and toys, so she didn't get him much.\n\nI let it go, but it still bothered me. My sister's kids are 8 and 6, which means they'll grow fast too, making her excuse a bit lame. I ended up asking her about it again, and she admitted that it was because Ann's kids are special. She said they were her \"heart and soul.\" I felt hurt by that but I thought maybe I was being too sensitive. I talked to my husband about it and he agreed it was hurtful and questioned whether we should go to my mom's for Christmas.\n\nI decided we won't go and called my mom to tell her. She got mad and said I was childish and needed to get over it because all grandmothers have their \"picks\" when it comes to grandchildren. She said she still loves my son and thinks I'll be hurting him by not letting him see her on Christmas. She's told Ann about it (and other people, vaguely, over Facebook), and Ann more or less said it's \"our problem\" and she's going to enjoy Christmas either way.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My sister's kids were 7 and 4 at the time, and she was expecting another in March.\n\nMy parents still live in the house we grow up in, and my sister lives 10 minutes away. She works, and my mom babysits her kids. Naturally, my mom is more attached to her kids than to  mine because she sees them every day. We live 7 hours away and she only sees my kids when we go visit her. \n\nMy sister has always been the \"Miracle Child\", because my mom had her tubes tied after I was born.

The niece and nephew unwrapped gift after gift \u00e0fter gift. All expensive toys. My oldest daughter looked at me and asked, \"Doesn't Grandma love us?\" When I could talk without crying, I told my mother she had taken it too far this time. I don't care if she gives gifts to her other grandkids 365 days a year, but what she did was deliberately cruel. I told her I was old enough to deal with her hatefulness, but my kids weren't.

Tell your mother she is wrong\n\nPP said it , your sister won't be the one expected to look after mum when she's old....that'll fall on you because she's conditioned you to be her maid.

She somehow managed to make us all feel like we were the most special one. Each and every one of us. She just doted on us. I'm going to cry, I miss her so much.

I still regret not spending more time with her.\n\nI LOVED my other grandmother so so much too and I know she loved us so much too, but she showed it different sometimes, and while she didn't have favorites, she was around the other family with grandkids more, and it hurt when she would make comments about us not being up to par with them. I know now she was just trying to... idk. Teach us I think. And she loved us all. But even still, it could hurt when she made comments to my Mom about \"Well your kids haven't washed the dishes.\" We were young, younger than the others, and we just did whatever we were asked too. I loved her, and I know she loved me, but it could hurt sometimes, even without explicit favorites. That's just life, but with explicit favorites... it's a whole different, worse ball game.\n\nIf she HAD actually had favorites, I can't tell you how upsetting it would be.

The two golden boys are.self centered and absolutely cannot understand that anything was wrong with how they were raised. There are both, however, kind and generous people for the most part. They just have enormous blind spots when it comes to their family dynamics.", "this is the best comment!!!"]}
