I'm not TA.  The bars came up with a creative solution.   Having smoking areas inside never really worked.  Having a solid door between the two areas does.  I can choose to stay away from the smoke.

Some people do still smoke on their houses here although it\u2019s usually only super old people who have smoked all their life. When I first moved in with my partner he lived in a house with his family and they were all hardcore smokers inside. It was so disgusting. They wouldn\u2019t even open windows. I was a smoker but also had asthma and it got to the point where I was waking up barely breathing. This was maybe 8-9 years ago.

And you know, let the smokers have those in peace.", "I'm not amarican. But where I'm from, there are no inside smoking areas. Only outside. I haven't seen a place that has inside anymore I  a few years.  \n\nBut as others said. OP was outside.", "It is a misconception that smokers are primarily addicted to nicotine. For many smokers, the inhalation ritual is at least as important as the nicotine. That's why there are also vapers who operate their e-cigarettes with nicotine-free liquid. If it were just about nicotine, it wouldn't make any sense.", "Sadly, I have tried those to try to smoke less and, in the end, quit. It worked for a while, but ironically, I just ended addicted to them instead when I tried chewing less of them. \n\nBut thanks for the advice! It's really appreciated! \nI'm currently talking with my doctor and exploring other ways to try to quit. I would prefer the extra years of life rather than smoking \ud83d\ude05", "[removed]", "Youre 100% wrong. Have you seen when smokers put 1 foot on a wall to smoke? Coolest kids this side of the tracks", "Good for Canada, but that's not relevant to the story.  If they were in Canada or if OP were sitting anywhere but the smoking section, maybe you'd have any argument, but they're not, so you don't.", ">But I agree - you don't sit in a smoking area and berate the smokers for smoking where they're permitted to do so.\n\nSo then why did you vote OP the asshole, instead of saying everyone sucks here?", "He's not an asshole for smoking in the smoking section. The couple is stupidly entitled. Do you also get angry at people drinking in bars? Or driving on roads?", "Wouldn't be surprised.", "I mean I'd hope hers was non alcoholic seeing as shes prego", "Reddit is legit an echo chamber lmao", "Reddit try not to bring politics into literally everything challenge. FAILED.\n\nAlso Conservates smoke more (excluding weed).

I don't feel safe in your safe space. I am not safe in your safe space. if this is a safe for me, you will have to deal with the potential of feeling unsafe, yourselves.", "Best to for them to avoid the smoking section, then.", "Then maybe don't sit in the smoking section.  Basic common sense isn't hard.", "They didn\u2019t care that much because they sat in the smoking section.", "Yea definitely true too :( that\u2019s why I made sure to clarify what each meant.", "Interesting, I\u2019m confused how this would even work. Are you legally allowed to ask someone their medical status? If not then how can you be sure they\u2019re pregnant and the bar isn\u2019t just discriminatory? Also what about women who are getting an abortion, or post miscarriage or birth? They often still look pregnant.\n\nThis kind of rule along with not selling alcohol in stores to pregnant women seems obviously discriminatory and an invasion of privacy to me.", "I wasn\u2019t saying OP was an asshole even if he was inside in a smoking section.", "I didn\u2019t say OP was inside. I said I didn\u2019t like smoking inside.\n\nBut where it\u2019s legal, it\u2019s legal. If the pub wants people to not smoke on their premises they can say so by having no smoking section. When you\u2019re in the smoking section you\u2019re in the clear.", "I agree, I\u2019m just mentioning that if you are addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes nicotine gum or nicotine patches might be a healthy alternative if that works for a smoker.", "I don\u2019t know if this is available on your area, but have you tried vaping?\n\nIn my area, I can get juice that had nicotine, and juice without, and blend them into the strength I want.\n\nSlowly start reducing nicotine content, and eventually you will just be huffing on no nic juice. At that point it\u2019s just a habit to break.\n\nI used to smoke a pack a day. I\u2019ve switched to vaping and that alone has rescued my lungs and my wallet. I\u2019m still working on weening out the vape, but I\u2019m far from my old pack-a-day habit.", "I\u2019m trying hypnosis this afternoon- this damn habit is hard to break.", "I hope your journey ends well for you!", "I wish you the best. Quitting in very hard and nic patches or gums didn't work for me either. After 35 years of smoking I addicted myself to nic salt vape and was off cigarettes in about two weeks thanks to the nic salt buzz then I stepped down my nic by adding zero nic until one day I was on zero and just kept forgetting my vape and eventually it got tossed in a drawer then in the trash. It's not for everybody but it's what worked for me. I am now 5 years nic free.", "Have you thought about the disconnect with that statement? Be addicted to nicotine and get that through cigarettes or gum. Which one you think is better for you?\n\nYeah, 12+ years after quitting smoking I'm still chewing gum. I know it carries its own set of issues for the body, but none of those are even close to what smoking does.", "In this case, the smoking area was outside from OPs description.", "I'm in Australia.  It IS illegal indoors everywhere.  Designated smoking areas are outdoors, usually without seating or protection from weather, and you're lucky if the area has an ashtray at all.  Fines for littering exceed $300 for each offense. As far as I know now you not only get fined for throwing a cigarette butt out the window but the driver also gets demerit points on their license.  Major public areas on streets, 4 meters from all doorways, 10 meters from any public transport stop. If you buy cigarettes on your way into Australia you can only have 20 cigarettes or 20 grams of tobacco.  One over that limit and the whole lot is confiscated until you pay a hefty import tax of around $150 per 200 cigarettes (slightly less than one carton) which is still very cheap compared to what you'd pay locally at around $55 per pack (20 cigarettes) which is a far cry from better quality and much more beautiful cigarettes from somewhere in Asia that would cost around three dollars.\n\nThey could just make it illegal but then they'd miss out on all that delicious tax revenue.  Needless to say the black market is thriving.", "bot", "Hard to argue with that!", "The best way to die a horrible death is to die with a foot against a wall smoking a big fat cigar. No.", "[deleted]", "Oh look, another \"conservative\" who's looking to be a snowflake victim in Reddit.", "If course you have. You conservatives arent known for their honesty and behave like a cult. Liberals might complain but conservatives are a factor of 10 times worse.", "Lol idk why you\u2019re getting so offended, it\u2019s not like I said that was SMART. I\u2019m just assuming that\u2019s what they thought.\n\nKnowingly sit in the smoking area, ask them not to smoke and if they agree then there\u2019s nowhere else anyone can smoke so no smoke. It\u2019s controlling and stupid, but that\u2019s the only line of thinking I can come up with to explain it, since they obviously did know they were sitting in a smoking area.", "Well. DUH. I never said they had a smart plan. Just that\u2019s the only reason I can think of for their behavior.", "It is if you\u2019re entitled lol", "No, like basically they want to go to the restaurant but don\u2019t want to be around smoke. Okay, sit in the smoking section and ask all the smokers not to smoke since she\u2019s pregnant. Problem solved, since no one in the smoking section is smoking and no one can smoke anywhere else. \n\nIt\u2019s entitled obviously, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s the line of thinking in some way.", "I didn\u2019t mean it like that! I meant more that you said inside smoking should be banned but he was outside.", "Hypnosis is what finally worked for me, it\u2019s been nearly two years now and the only full cigarette I\u2019ve smoked is when o witnessed a shooting. I also took some drags when really drunk on Halloween lol.", "Do you get off being this dense. Everyone knows smoking has no glma end, you dont need to tell -people to just quit. They probably already know they should.", "You have to know I\u2019m joking", "Just before the firing squad gets the order to shoot or not? With our without blindfold?", ">One such example is leaning your seat back on a plane. It's do-able but most people think it's wrong to do.\n\nLol what? This is a weird take and not true??", "She wont get the carcinogens if she doesnt sit right next to the smoker who is smoking in the smoking section.", "Why do you keep intentionally ignoring the fact that **the pregnant woman literally made the personal choice to sit in the smoking section**?", "It\u2019s a designated spot for smoking this is the equivalent of walking into a dump and complaining that it smells like trash and people are assholes for dumping all this trash in this one area. \n\nWhat do you expect to be going on in this area?", "What? When did I try to be a victim? I just said other than weed which all the liberal guys I knew at uni smoked, conservatives smoked cigarettes and cigars more. I'd hardly say that's me trying to be a victim.", "Is it wrong to say an adjacent opinion though?", "Yes, it\u2019s very funny", "I don\u2019t think I understand that commend at all. Mind explaining? I do think if you\u2019re about to die smoking might be fine, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. Smoking would be a great fun thing to do if you don\u2019t have to deal with the negative side effects that happen over the years."]}
