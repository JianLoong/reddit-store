Anyway passive smoking is bad and that's why we banned it", "> I was a smoker but also had asthma and it got to the point where I was waking up barely breathing. \n\nMy Asthma is one of the many reasons I've never even tried smoking, and I don't plan to. I get enough of a reaction when I'm in my apartment with my windows open, and someone a few balconies away decides to smoke on their balcony. \n\n>He would also hork out his window which was the front of the house.
