I don't want to say which country due to privacy, but needless to say it's a big move.

Not taking this job is just not an option for me. \n\nI recently married my wife (also in her 50s) and she's going to be moving with me to Europe. Both of us have children from a previous marriage who won't be moving with us.

She has a massive anxiety disorder (especially concerning COVID) and she's always calling my wife to complain about her anxieties. My wife is really worried about telling her about the move because she almost certainly won't take it well (on top of her mom moving she's never liked me in the first place). \n\nI think that we should just move and tell her after we've already left. Her daughter is 18, living on her own at college, and should be old enough to deal with it. I don't want her to get upset and delay everything.

My wife is more on the fence about it, but after explaining my reasoning she's coming around to the idea. \n\nThe problem is with my daughter (17f). I've been staying at my ex-wife's apartment (I know it's a strange arrangement, but I've lived with her on and off after the divorce due to my job situation) and my kids of course there too. I like to talk with my wife via video call each evening, and last night we were talking about the move and her worries about how her daughter is going to take it. \n\nAfter I hung up last night, my daughter came up to me and said that what I'm doing is extremely messed up, and that my wife absolutely should tell her daughter she's moving before it happens. I got mad at her for eavesdropping, to which she said that that we live in an apartment and with how loud my speaking voice is she has to listen to me talk whether she wants to or not. I conceded that that's true, but she still has no right to give me advice on my relationship and especially not using information she wasn't even supposed to overhear. \n\nMy daughter called me an asshole and went back to her room to sulk.

Your stepdaughter has massive anxiety and is barely a legal adult and you and your wife are moving continents. And your best move is to \u2026just leave. So you want her MOM, her safety net for her whole life to lie to her and just tell her when you have moved. Wow. \n\nYTA. I feel awful for your stepdaughter who you clearly don\u2019t care about and from actions shown are rather annoyed by her.", "Please please tell me I didn\u2019t just read about two grown-ass adults who want to sneak out of the *country* while their child, who struggles with anxiety is at school, and then call her after you\u2019ve packed up her home and abandoned her and tell her mommy\u2019s gone far away, but she so very happy, so don\u2019t fuss! \n\nIs this your petty revenge for her not liking you? I mean, no wonder she doesn\u2019t if this is how you conduct your life. Your 17-year old daughter knows this is wrong and has already given the correct verdict: YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour wife should absolutely not move without first telling her daughter, it will destroy all trust in their relationship.\n\nYou sound pretty self absorbed about this.", "YTA for not planning to tell your step daughter at college what your concrete plans are.  You say she has anxiety.  How does taking her mother to ANOTHER F'ING CONTINENT and DOING IT SECRETLY not going to worsen her anxiety?!?\n\nAnd YTA for ragging on your own daughter who you dragged into your plans by not being clever enough to take a walk or close the door and speak quietly.  Any thoughtful teen daughter is going to have thoughts and feelings about your horrible plans for their teen step-sister.  It speaks well of her that she raised her concerns when you shouted your plans to her.  Apparently her mother's influence helped raise a decent kid.\n\nAlthough I suspect this was written by the daughter.  Such a clueless father 1) doesn't care what other people think, and 2) wouldn't portray his callousness and shortsightedness so well.", "YTA and you know it. I'm sure it's easy for you to up and leave your kids since your ex wife probably does most of the parenting anyway but your wife clearly has a different relationship with her daughter. Your job is not more important than her child. Or your own children for that matter. You wanna up and leave and spring this info on her daughter so your wife can't change her mind and it's honestly sick.

I actually got nothing, this is just amazing.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Whenever you combine, secret and easier for you, YTA. To sum up your story and plan, you want to secretly abandon your wife's 18 year old daughter who has emotional issues because, gosh won't that make the exit easier for you.

Your wife doesn\u2019t stop being a parent just because her daughter is 18 and at college. YTA and if your wife goes along with this she\u2019s absolutely an AH too. \n\nObviously you don\u2019t want to tell her before hand because your wife will likely want to stay with her child.

It\u2019s so messed up! \nHow can you both think it\u2019s a good idea to move that far away with no warning.

Your wife is a major asshole to consider doing that to her daughter that\u2019s already struggling that much.", "Yep you are. Your similarly aged daughter was trying to give you something important , you should listen. Your wife's kid has anxiety. Leaving the country without telling her could cause big issues.

No wonder your stepdaughter doesn\u2019t like you.", "YTA absolutely, thoroughly, with no question. \n\nYou want the easy way out with no confrontation before you go. This is an enormous betrayal to not tell her daughter, who is clearly emotionally dependent on her mother, that her mother is moving overseas. Honestly, I'll be surprised if your wife doesn't divorce you over this. I sure would.", "YTA. That is a HORRIBLE thing to do.

If the girl already has anxiety about a lot of stuff, finding out her mother moved to a whole new country further away from her is not going to end well, and will also probably end up with you in Europe alone while your wife moves back to Canada to be with her daughter who is likely to have a whole break down after finding out.\n\nYou can very well tell her now so there can be multiple conversations about it happening to lessen her anxiety about it.", "YTA. \n\nYour wife has a very young adult for a daughter. And I am sure said daughter expected to be able to see her mom for holidays, vacations etc during her college years. She already deals with anxiety and having her mom just up and disappear is a terrible idea. Does the daughter have somewhere she can stay for those holidays and vacations? Does she have a support system? At the bare minimum the daughter has the right to know where her mom is. \n\nYour own comments about your kids aren't great either. Pretending they won't be affected doesn't make them not affected.", "YTA.  The idea that your wife would move to a different continent without telling her daughter is absolutely deranged.", "Your daughter is right.  YTA.   And this isn\u2019t a close call.", "Absolutely YTA! How do you think your wife's daughter is going to feel after her mom moves out of the country without telling her? I will tell you, she is going to feel abandoned, unloved, scared, and its going to do wonders for her anxieties. My mother and I were not super close and had lots of problems, one of which was her getting married when I was 21 without letting me know, hell I didn't even know she was dating anyone. Mind you I lived in another state but still, its just strange to not tell your only child that you are getting married. FYI there was a small ceremony with their friends and some family members, I was just not invited or told. This is not the only issues we have, and there are many, but we are now completely NC after 20 years of very rare calls and the occasional holiday text. This is what you have to look forward to, and if your wife doesn't leave you or something, then it will be in her future as well. I also agree with your daughter as she seems to be the only rational person in the family.", "YTA. Small wonder her daughter doesn\u2019t like you.", "YTA . You are only thinking about yourself.", "YTA and if she goes along with this so is your wife. This will go far beyond triggering your step-daughter\u2019s anxiety. She is going to be left with tremendous trust and abandonment issues, issues she may never be able to fully resolve. Issues that will effect every future relationship in her life. It is beyond cruel. It\u2019s downright evil. How could you consider treating someone like this? I\u2019m disgusted.", "YTA 100%. congrats on convincing your wife in betraying her daugthers trust, and if theyr relationship goes bad after this you will have a stepdaugther that hates u and a wife that resent u. if ur wife do this she is also the A", "Waauuuw. I really wonder why the daughter doesn't like you... Such a *mystery*.\n\nSeriously, how dare you even suggest something like that? YTA.\nAnd kinda hoping your wife leaves you. Actually, let me edit that: I hope she moves out and files for divorce *and tells you about it two weeks later*.", "YTA\n\nAre you intentionally trying to destroy their relationship?  Honestly I don't think I could be with someone who would suggest such a thing.\n\nYour daughter is right, hopefully she realizes how huge of a asshole you are and goes no contact after she gets away from you.", "YTA \nCan\u2019t believe your 17 years old is more mature then a 50 years old man. Guess it was a blessing she was reused by the ex wife I guess.\nIt\u2019s a big thing having a family member moving in another continent. Emotionally AND logistically (emergency contacts and plans, what will happen when college campuses are closed, holidays, visiting visas and so on)\nHaving a solid plan in action, having time to talk to your wife\u2019s daughter about it will actually make the transition smoother then not dropping the bomb and not have discussed anything ahead.\nWhat a major AH and also you have 0 plans about ANYTHING. I will be anxious too and I have no anxiety problems.", "I can't imagine what you will do to the trust between your wife and your daughter if you pull this off. YTA. This is a whole new level of assholery. Exactly how do you imagine this is going to go down when she finds out? This kind of crisis for someone with mental health challenges could derail them for years or worse....", "YTA. Not just an asshole. You are a fucking huge asshole and a horrible human being. \n\nYou are pretending to hide how horrible you are behind \u201ccaring for her\u201d, but you are just a big pile of bullshit. \n\nI hope you wife leaves you.", "I hope to god you aren't able to convince your wife to be as big of an asshole as you are. Yep, yta.", "Your daughter is 100% right. This is \"extremely messed up\" and, frankly, would be unforgivable. How dare you? YTA", "YTA. Your argument that your stepdaughter will deal with it better once you've moved a few thousand miles away is bullshit. It's in no way for her benefit, it's just because you don't want to have to deal with her being upset at her mother moving to a different continent, end of story. Your idea is totally selfish, and your daughter is correct.", "YTA. Your children are close to grown but not quite grown yet. You need to tell them and you need to be prepared from them not to like it.", "YTA, for all the reasons already stated.", "YTA and I only hope your wife chooses to speak with her daughter about these plans regardless of your wishes to keep them secret from her. Her daughter needs time to process how her world is going to dramatically change without the access to her mother.", "YTA and I feel so bad for this vulnerable young woman that her mother is starting to 'come around' to this absolutely woeful idea.", "Yta", "YTA. I can't believe you are even asking. It doesn't matter if your step daughter has anxiety issues or not, she needs to know her mom is moving far away.", "Always impressed by how detailed some people make their troll posts.", "YTA. Why can\u2019t you just move to Europe and your wife can join when/if she\u2019s ready? How will daughter be able to see her mom over holidays?", "YTA. I really can't believe you came up with this ridiculous scheme and even more surprised your wife is going along with it!  Your 17 year old daughter has more sense than both of you!", "What did I just read? Clearly YTA, and your wife will be too if she doesn\u2019t actually tell her daughter.", "Come between the daughter and her mother and you WILL lose. You\u2019ve been warned.", "Yta. Who the fuck moves out of the country and doesn't tell their kids first?!?", "YTA.", "You sound like my own parent who moved overseas when I was 17 without much notice or regard for family.  YTA and worthless as a parent.", "What is wrong with you?", "YTA - You would be a monster for going ahead with this without telling her - imagine your parent abandoning you to move to another country without so much as a word. Forget about independence and all that bull, because you know it's an excuse, how is she expected to 'handle' things like an adult when neither of you will even talk to her like an adult? Either you think she's an adult or you don't, not when it suits you only. Depending on which parent she even lives with full time, it would absolutely impact her living arrangements and other important things, but you aren't even entertaining the idea of preparing her for this very massive shift in lifestyle.\n\nIf there was ever a bridge burning event, then this would be it. To be so cold as to not inform her own child that she is going permanently leave the country, it's as if you're admitting 'we don't want you around, enjoy your life, speak to you never.'\n\nSo let me ask you this - why on earth can't you travel and get settled there first, then figure out your wifes travel arrangements AFTER she has a good heart to heart with her kid and clears the air.

You should find a new job.", "What the actual fuck?\nThe gorl has an anxiety disorder, and you think just moving without telling hercis better than giving her a warning and time to get used to the idea.\n\nMy ex-husband moved without telling my kids, and it freaking DEVASTATED my oldest. \n\nYes... you'd be an asshole for fircing your wife to abandon her daughter without warning.", "\"I think that we should just move and tell her after we've already left.\"\n\nJesus Christ. \n\nYTA", "YTA and your 17 year old daughter is correct.", "YTA.

She came home early for a surprise visit to find family was gone! She had no idea where they had moved to! This was before cell phones existed. Mother sent her a letter but it didn't arrive until close to Thanksgiving. They told her she was 18 and had financial aid and they figured she could take care of herself! \nShe NEVER trusted her parents again. And I think never spent a holiday with them again. She had college friends who let her visit over breaks.", "Your daughter has no right to give you advice, yet strangers on Reddit do? Your stepdaughter will have a meltdown when she finds out. Then, when she gets better, she will go no-contact with the both of you. Your wife will miss out on her graduation, wedding, grandchildren.
