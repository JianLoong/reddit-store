She tried to get me to buy he a more recent one from Amazon, but it was over $900, so I declined.\n\nI bought the computer in August, and she promised to pay me $100 per month, for the next 6 months, and I\u2019m sure you know where this is going\u2026\n\nEvery month she had an issue and she didn\u2019t have the $100. She even tried to buy me a Christmas gift, like \u201cpls just pay me back.\u201d\n\nShe called me yesterday and said that she\u2019d lost her job and just didn\u2019t know when she\u2019d be able to pay me, so she would just be giving the computer back. I didn\u2019t say anything except \u201cokay. I\u2019ll pick it up tomorrow \u201c\n\nThen she called today offering me $100 for the month, and I told her \u201cthat\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll be over in a little to get the computer \u201c and this is where I think I may be an AH. She told me that she\u2019s gotten attached to the computer, and thinks she just needs more time, but I said \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll come a grab it when I get off from work\u201d\n\nShe sounded a little sad, but she has been steadily working since September and has purchased other items, so repaying me has not been an important action\u2026.\n\n\u2026.but, really , AITA?\n\nUpdate: I went to get the computer and she\u2019s done a fair bit of crying to her father and he just paid me the entire $600!!

She didn\u2019t pay, she doesn\u2019t get to keep it. \n\nYou\u2019re not running a charity.", "NTA. It was a large purchase that was made clear it was being purchased with the intent of repayment. \n\nMy question for you however, is what are you going to do with it now? If you think she can actually pay you back, draw up something in writing with a downpayment, and payments per month she can actually handle if you're ok loaning the money out until then. I'd even suggest a lower payment up front, then once she's reemployed, the payment goes up.", "NTA - You did the right thing by taking it back. She was taking advantage of your kindness. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She tried to get me to buy he a more recent one from Amazon, but it was over $900\n\nFirst red flag\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> She told me that she\u2019s gotten attached to the computer\n\npfft. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've learned to keep my distance from these kinds of people.", "NTA. Offer to hold it for her and she can continue to pay you and you can give it to her when she\u2019s paid it off", "Nope, definitely NTA. You bought the dang computer and she agreed to pay you back but then didn't? That's not cool. And now she wants more time?? Nah bro, stick to your guns and get that laptop back ASAP. She needs a reality check and some budgeting skills tbh lol no offense tho \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nta, but if you really don't need the computer for yourself, let it keep her and just give us more reminders that you want your money. And remember, never lend a person anything you can't afford to lose. Whether it's family or friends. Because your family, you're always going to be low on the payback totem pole. You would be doing something nice for someone else and kind of paying it forward. Don't tell her this and kind of remind her. You want the money back nicely. And if you get the money back, that's a windfall if you don't, chaulk it up to a learning lesson and move on", "NTA - You\u2019re definitely taking a rough / strict stance but you are well within your rights to do so. \n\nYou may be doing her a favor, by teaching her if you don\u2019t make payments things may be taken away. It\u2019s a good life lesson. \n\nWhile you might get some backlash for it you\u2019re not wrong. She was probably hoping you would just drop it or write it off as a gift but you don\u2019t need to.", "NTA, she was supposed to pay for it and didn't. Next time she makes a payment arrangement, she should remember to stick to it. She needed the lesson.", "INFO - So, was it made clear that you would get her a laptop on the condition that she pays it back? Because that's important. Could easily assume that it is judging by the context of the post but..\n\nEdit: NTA for sure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
