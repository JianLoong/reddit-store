I understood, I mean it has happened to me before and it's completely natural. \n\nAt night my husband turns to me and said that since he woke up early that day that he would be sleeping in the next day (Sunday), I said no since that is not our agreement and that it's not my fault he didn't sleep in. He said that it's not fair because he works and I don't. \n\nTo give a little more context I'm a SAHM and he works full time during the week. The thing is I do most of the household chores (which I don't mind btw) and his only responsibility is taking out the trash and unload the dishwasher. I do everything else + take care of the baby, he usually just helps me with baths and watches/plays with her while I make dinner. We're fine with how things are, we're a happy couple and family but I don't think it's okay for him to throw around that he works and I don't when it was a joint decision that I would stay home with the baby until she turns 1. \n\nHe ended up waking early and letting me sleep in today but when I woke up he let me know that he was really tired and that I wasn't nice to him and should've let him sleep in instead. \n\nAITA for not letting my husband sleep in? \n\nExtra info: we usually wake up at the same time during the week since I pack his bag for work, so I don't sleep more than him during the week and when my baby naps I do chores that I can't do when she's awake.", "created_utc": 1693745300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168w5j8/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_sleep_in_on_the/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This isn't my idea but something my friend did when she was in the same situation.  She documented her schedule for the entire week.  Down to things like:  1:05pm - son napped, did dishes, planned dinner.  \n\nIt really gave her husband a better insight into what the SAHM life was like and how she wasn't snacking on chocolates watching General Hospital all day.", "NTA.\n\nI know things happen, but I do think it's good you stood your ground. Y'all made an agreement and it was upheld, you kept a standard.\n\nIn employed/SAHP arrangements, it's way too easy sometimes for the employed parent to forget they are, in fact, also a parent. This is what leads to parents saying things like they're going to \"babysit\" their own kid by not being involved enough. You made a joint decision to have a baby, and it needs to be a joint effort to raise it. And sometimes that means being sleepy.\n\nAdditionally, you ARE working - you're working a job with *zero* days off. At least your spouse gets the weekends off from his job. Asking him to take over baby duty *one morning a week* is not unreasonable.", "NTA \n\n\u201cand that I wasn\u2019t nice to him and should\u2019ve let him sleep in instead\u201d \n\nand that\u2019s how you know your partner cares more about themselves than you or your well-being\n\neta in no way we\u2019re you mean or even rude. he\u2019s literally just being a parent", "NTA. Hopefully you changed his diaper and got him a warm bottle, too.", "NTA\n\nYour husband could take a nap in the afternoon if he really is that tired.", "NTA. This is the exact same arrangement I had with my husband when ours was a baby. He works outside of the home. You work 24/7. You get up with the baby 6 days a week and it is not your fault he didn\u2019t stay in bed. You deserve one morning a week too.", "NTA\nYou would be if you purposely woke him up early and ruined his sleep, but you didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not your fault he couldn\u2019t sleep any longer. Sunday was your turn. If he wants more sleep, he can nap or go to bed early. \nIf he\u2019d been nice and asked to sleep in, that would be another thing, but he made the unilateral decision that you now get to wait another week to sleep in, and if you start giving him both weekend days to sleep in, he\u2019ll start insisting it\u2019s always that way because you can just deal with it. You both deserve the opportunity to sleep in regularly.  He doesn\u2019t get to just take yours whenever he wants.", "NTA. He isn't being a good partner or parent. The fact that you're not making money doesn't mean you're not working. You're engineering a life for him that would cost well over $100k if he has ro pay for someone to care for his home, feed him, and do round the clock child care. Regardless of him occasionally taking out trash or playing with a baby while you cook he's not pulling his weight. There needs to be a conversation about an equitable spread of work. He needs to pack his own bags for work. He needs to allow you breaks rather than just spending time eotj thr baby while you do other chores. He needs to step up and thr fact that he sometimes wakes up a bit early o. His \"sleep in\" day through no fault of yours doesn't give him the ability to steal your sleep in day. He's a major ah", "NTA. As you said, it's not your problem that he got up early on Saturday morning.", "NTA. Your workload isn\u2019t any lesser than his just because you don\u2019t get a paycheck!! Taking care of a baby IS hard work AND you even take care of almost all household chores!! This just shows how little he values and appreciates the domestic work you do, and puts his work over yours.\n\nPlus, both of you agreed on this arrangement. So it didn\u2019t work out once because he just naturally couldn\u2019t continue to sleep in. That\u2019s NOT your fault!!", "NTA, it's a shared responsibility and he needs to stick to his commitments", "NTA you agreed to something and he can\u2019t break it whenever he feels tired.", "NTA - You have a reasonable arrangement, it's not your fault that he couldn't get back to sleep after being woken up by the baby, welcome to parenthood. The only advantage I see that you have over him when it comes to sleep is that you may be able to nap when the baby naps; however, I would guess that there are other household tasks or things you want to do for yourself during those couple of hours during the day.", "NTA only because he told you, not asked you, that he would be sleeping in the next day.  If he had asked if it would be ok and explained his reasons, then I'd go with NAH based on good communication.", "NTA. If you wake up early, you choose how to spend the time. He could have stayed in bed, read, played on his phone, lay back down with his eyes closed, etc etc. he chose to get up! He doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally decide HE gets a lie in the next morning just because he woke up early.", "NTA. Your husband needs to pull his weight in being a husband & a father and being selfish about trying yo take your only day you get to have a lie in. When do you get any down-time? You do all the childcare, guessing night feeds and all the housework? He cant throw fact he works in your face as that was your agreement and honestly being SAHM to an infant is harder than most jobs. I went back to work as a doctor two months ago after year off with my baby & I honestly find work easier than looking after my baby all day & doing house chores, even though I work 10 hours+. My work days are now my \u2018break\u2019. You should take a whole morning/afternoon/even day off so your husband knows all that you do & develops appreciation for your labour.", "NTA. He could have stayed upstairs and relaxed. You didn\u2019t ask for him to come down. \n\nSounds like you have 2 children with the amount you do for him, have you reevaluated your set up at all recently?", "NTA not your fault he couldn\u2019t sleep in perhaps a nap in the afternoon would help him. I get it you stay home it\u2019s what you both decided on therefore the majority of chores fall on you I\u2019m not here to argue if that\u2019s right or wrong (it\u2019s right because it\u2019s right for you), what I\u2019ll argue though is him saying you don\u2019t work, how about you leave everything that you do, other than taking direct care of the baby, undone he\u2019ll soon learn how much \u201cwork\u201d you do", "NTA. If you didn\u2019t wake up your husband, and if you didn\u2019t then go back to bed and sleep soundly for another couple hours, then it sounds like bad luck for him and zero to do with fairness. \n\nI\u2019ll add that after raising a couple kids (and puppies lol), the rigid schedule of fairness sounds like cute idea to me at this point. If it works then great but in my experience, my husband and I have both had to be much more flexible over time. So many factors go into how everyone is feeling and what they need and you have to put the \u201cteam\u201d health first.", "I agree with you that it was not valid for him to throw out the \"I work and you stay at home\" reason.  Being at home with an infant AND taking making a nice home to live in is work.  Also, just because he woke up, does not mean you have give up your sleep in day.  Maybe he can make up for it with a nap instead?\n\nINFO:  Was this baby nursed around the clock and continues to nurse?  Because if so, that's kinda a +1 in your column right there.\n\nBut, aside from that, it seems like you have a good thing going on in your marriage.  And things should not be tit for tat or +1 I did this or that.\n\nInstead, you should sit down and have a rational conversation about how you found this comment hurtful and explain all the things you do do at home while he is at his job and see if it changes his mind.", "NTA but it seems like it would have been such a small courtesy which partners do for each other from time to time.", "sounds like it was just a rocky weekend, nothing too serious. i think it\u2019s good he expressed how he felt about you not letting him sleep in rather than bottling it up and being petty. he might\u2019ve felt it was unfair because the weekends are the only time he gets genuine rest and doesn\u2019t have to worry about work (other than y\u2019all\u2019s child) and probably values that rest whenever he gets the chance. i see both sides but suggest you both talk it through and come to a mutual agreement that if things like this occur again in the future, you\u2019ll have a backup plan.", "Hmmm, this is tough because I can see both sides. It kind of depends on his job. Does he work overtime every week? Is he a truck driver or a machine operator? Then you should make an exception. If he works a low stress desk job, he can deal. You\u2019re both in your twenties. Enjoy how easy it is to get to sleep most of the time, and how you can shrug off a night without. It won\u2019t always be this way.", "NTA for sticking to the agreement, he woke up early, it happens. Small yta for not showing a little flexibility in what seems like a good marriage.", "ESH. Sounds like a great deal you two made and are sticking with. But just think about this: Monday when 10month old naps, you \ud835\udc84\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f too if you want.  Can he at work? It is not the best sleep, but it is in fact, sleep.  I don\u2019t think every once in a while, if you altered the agreement as needed, for both of you is the end of the world. Sometimes you may be more exhausted and need it because the baby was sick all week and you were run ragged.  I may be reading more into this but it sounds like the first time he did this. You make it sound like you have a great agreement and you both stick to it.  Once is not a deal breaker; sometimes you have to be flexible as it might work out you need a change too from time to time.", "YTA, simply for not making an exception. You're a SATHM, and he STILL is helping with chores. Sure, he could have expressed himself better, but think how YOU would feel if for ONE day you feel more tired than normal and want to rest and he says no because of some arbitrary principles.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only time I did that was when she was born, I slept while she slept but it was more due to being extremely tired from childbirth and around the clock nursing.", "He's not a workhorse who never gets a break he's also weaponizing his feelings against his wife who is literally working every minute he is and more. He's trying to steal more time from her.", "He works in logistics, he sometimes has to do some heavy lifting but it's not everyday and sometimes not every week, he does mostly desk work. Works 8am-5pm and no overtime.", "This is not an equal division of labor.

Being employed and contributing to household chores are not mutually exclusive; otherwise, every single person with a full-time job would be living in their own filth. They both live in the house and taking care of it is both their responsibilities.\n\nEspecially before the year mark, taking care of an infant can be a full-time job in and of itself. At least OP's husband gets the weekend off.\n\nOOOOOOOHHH WOW, Husband *took out the trash in his own home*! What's that you say? He's employed, also? AND it was a 40-gallon trash bag?!

She is working longer hours and taking on more of the home and childcare consistently. It's not her fault he couldn't sleep in longer. He's taking advantage of her as it is. Letting him behave like a toddler to steal more time from her sleep is not the answer.", "The pandemic hit when ours was 13 months. Suddenly, we both were working from home.

So it\u2019s already in the works, which is good.
