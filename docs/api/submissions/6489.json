Never heard of it before.", "Perhaps my wording could have been better. \n\n>Don't expect everyone to be there the whole time though, and don't be offended when some people opt not to attend certain gatherings.\n\nHere, I was referring to a situation where *if* OP decided to take over the event themselves, invite everyone they want, and pay for any outings, that OP should expect that not everyone would attend, and to be okay with that, rather than feel hurt by their lack of maturity when someone opts out. I'm mostly concerned that OP might be hurt if the event doesn't go according to their expectations.", "Unfortunately\u2026..I\u2019m sure she would \ud83e\udd72", "Now THIS!!", "Yeah, for graduation photos!", "Cool", "NTA", "NTA\n\n> SM interjects and tells me to make sure that my dad doesn\u2019t have to interact with my mom at all \n\nLolololol so if they get near each other, are you supposed to run from your spot or off the stage to play mediator for two grown adults?\n\nLike, even logistically this isn\u2019t a feasible request. (I also think it\u2019s unreasonable to put the responsibility of two other people behaving civily on you.) \n\nIf they want to have a private dinner with you the next day, that would be one thing - but essentially trying to exclude your mom, and only your mom from celebrating with you is gross.\n\nIt\u2019s like saying someone can come to the wedding and isn\u2019t invited to the reception.", "NTA", "NTA. They\u2019re all adults and if they love you they can find a way to manage their feelings for a day. This is going to be one of many family situations they\u2019re going to have to deal with, and there is no time like the present to put on their grown-up pants and practice some maturity and civility. Your SM is doing her best to micro-manage and obviously is holding onto some negative feelings. You don\u2019t own this, and she should know better than to put you in this position. The only words that should have come out of her (or anyone\u2019s) mouth are \u201cWe\u2019re all so proud of you! How would you like to celebrate!\u201d So no, after all that nonsense, you are NTA and if she can\u2019t get it together, she can miss out.", "nta", "Chile NTA, SM is making your day about her.", "NO! YOU MY DEAR ARE SETTING BOUNDARIES , \ud83d\udc4f BRAVO!  People who are older such as myself are uncomfortable doing what you just did. However, long term this may have an effect on future interactions so this is where being the bigger person may help. If you have the time, I'd consider maybe writing an email to explain calmly how you feel without using the term, \"you!\" Both parents have contributed to your success and as she is someone that has been a partner of your dad long tern she has as well ( sometimes a little butter goes a long way) Maybe asking if they can consider putting differences on the back burner for one evening would mean a tremendous amount to you and suggest getting them together beforehand to try and work out the issue or at least get their feelings out on the table to prevent a blow up at your event. If unable to compromise or meeting goes to shit then request she not come as to avoid an uncomfortable situation for everyone. Please be prepared for dad not showing up if she throws a huge tantrum.. best of luck and congrats. \nP.s. this is the start of many milestones in your journey so setting the tone of boundaries is essential, doesn't mean being mean; it means protecting your mental state of mind.", "NTA\n\nMy parents divorced when I was 16. \n\nWhile they are polite, I don\u2019t like seeing the awkward interactions. I also know my mom doesn\u2019t like being around my dad, who was narcissistic and emotionally abusive. \n\nBut you know what? They\u2019re the adults. They\u2019re the parents. If I have a big event and I want them all there, they do it. \n\nIt\u2019s not our problem as children of divorced parents to manage their interactions.", "Everyday she asks, AITA?", "NTA. My parents have despised each other since before they divorced in the 90s and you can bet your sweet ass that they sucked it up and walked on either side of me with a smile at my Senior Night in high school and they sucked it up again at my graduation, my sister's graduation, my sister's wedding, multiple birthday parties for my nephew, and a couple of family funerals. Your parents can be polite and keep apart as much as possible while respecting you and your achievements. And your stepmother can either choose suck it up, smile, and act with some basic human decency or she can politely decline to show her face. \n\nGood for you for insisting that either everyone celebrates together or not at all. Keep that spine shiny and stick to your guns.", "Boundaries. You needed to set them. So no.", "NTA, adults should be able to set aside their differences to celebrate their loved ones. If they don't have those skills they shouldn't be making public appearances.", "Nta because you're right. It's your day. Your father wasn't even the one saying he didn't want to interact with your mom. MIL has a lot of nerve", "NTA \n\nGraduated last year and had this happen to me, only difference is I let my parents walk all over me and set aside different plans for each \u201cside\u201d of the family. OP it is the most miserable experience of your life. If they don\u2019t want to put their differences aside for a day like adults for you they shouldn\u2019t be there to ruin your moment", "NTA, she's not integral to this. She wants to call the shots, she can get her own PhD", "I mean, OP did tell her that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", " NTA - I had similar family dynamics for graduation. Invite them all & enjoy your day!!", "I'm going to go with a controversial NHA, so why?\n\nWell obviously Dad is uncomfortable around his ex and SM is just trying to protect him and stand up for her man, and it is reasonable to want to take you out to celebrate but not include his ex, that's not horrible. \n\nBut it's not wrong to say no, you don't want to split the day between people, or manage the adualt, and its all or nothing. That is your right.\n\nI'd say if either of you make it personal and get nasty and mean then that changes things, but so far neither or you are AH for having feelings and preferences or expressing them.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHave a zoom call with all your parents and advise them this is one very important day in your life and to please model the behavior that they would expect from you.    (in otherwords, they need to act like adults and get over their squabbles).     As you said, if they are not able to celebrate your massive achievement then you won't feel slighted by them making another choice for that day.   But you may have to be prepared for either all or none of them to show.\n\nHUGE CONGRATS ON YOUR GRADUATION!!!!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTell SM that your graduation celebration is not hers. She will not impose her notions or drama on it. She can either get over her issues with your mom, or she can stay home.", "NTA, what a beautiful shiny spine you have! Stand your ground, she can either leave her attitude at home or leave her whole self at home.", "Congratulations on completing your Ph.D!!!  I wish you all the best as you continue forward with your journey!\n\nNTA. This is YOUR celebration and you are in charge. Your dad and sm are adults and should be focused on you."]}
