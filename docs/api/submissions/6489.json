They have not been together for 30 years. True, they couldn't stand each other for most of my childhood. Then my dad remarried when I was like 9 and my mom and step couldn't stand each other. They wouldn't interact for the most part. But guess what, they were extremely civil when I graduated high school and college and invited them all to celebrate.
