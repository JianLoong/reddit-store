My sister is getting married in November and currently we are in the process of getting the clothes made for the wedding. Indian weddings are usually quite large and extravagant with several events. I as the bride\u2019s sister will be expected to dress very nicely so I am having my clothes custom made as well. \n\nYesterday we went to our first fitting for the outfits and the moment my sister saw my outfits she was upset. I am having four different lehengas made which are like a crop top and a long skirt made for her wedding events. My sister on the other hand is choosing to wear suits which are like a long tunic with baggy pants on the bottom. My sister once she saw me in the outfits told me they were too revealing and would like me to wear something more toned down as she herself will be in a suit. I\u2019ll admit we both look very different and have different body types so her choice of outfit is a much better fit for her. She got even more upset when I pointed out that several of our cousins will be wearing similar outfits to the wedding. She said she doesn\u2019t care what they do but that I should let her have the \u201cspotlight\u201d for this one event in her life.     \n\nHere is where I may be the AH, I told her that no matter what I wear she will be insecure and her insecurities are for her to deal with. Indian moms can be quite blunt and I won\u2019t lie our entire life my mom has pointed out just how different we look physically. I can see why she would be insecure but I don\u2019t see why I have to cater to her insecurities. My mom agrees with me and told my sister I will be wearing the lehengas as that\u2019s what looks best on me. I\u2019m not going to lie I think Indian suits look frumpy to me and I want to wear what flatters me. I\u2019d rather not even go if I wear a suit, they look better on more matronly women. So AITA in this situation ?\n\nFor more context this what the lehengas I\u2019m getting made looks like more or less: https://www.utsavfashion.com/product/embroidered-net-tiered-lehenga-in-dark-green-lyc2462-sh22?geoip_country=us&&&gclid=CjwKCAjwgsqoBhBNEiwAwe5w067IubqFXd4XSvoKh0nmEWvZHwY_i70uxQzDrO4QeaDjWkP5y4LlahoCzhQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds\n\nThis what my sister would like me to wear: https://www.suratwholesaleshop.com/catalog/panjabi-style-art-silk-new-designer-patiyala-salwar-suits-collection-for-wedding-function-17117\n\n\n***clarification this is not the suit my sister is wearing. She would like me to wear something like this. She has had several suits made for her wedding all which have very heavy amounts of embroidery and crystals. There is no way anyone will not think she is the bride.", "created_utc": 1695757796, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sxxwt/aita_for_telling_my_sister_she_will_be_insecure/", "score": 4462, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t have to wear one with the frumpy salwar bottoms! You can wear shararra, palazzo, garara!! There are so many beautiful and classy suits you can pick.\n\nAlso, for your argument, that the other guests at the wedding would be wearing  lehenga: those other guests are not going to be standing next to her in her important pictures. You will be. As a result, your outfit will scream \u2018\u2019pick me!!!\u201d. \n\nYou should know better how our community rips apart a woman based on her looks and instead of making it most comfortable and enjoyable for your sister, you are focussed on you looks! Grow up! This is more than insta picture moment. Simple and classy is better.", "You mother has pointed out 'how different we look physically'.  It sounds so anodyne, doesn't it?  So harmless.  And yet here I am left with the suspicion that your mother has basically told your sister that she is fat and you are perfect.  How lovely for your sister.\n\nIn Western weddings there is a generally accepted rule that guests do not wear white.  The idea is that you don't compete with the bride.  It would be kind of you to accept that the bride here, the most important person at this wedding, is not you but your sister, and it would be kind of you to tie in with the clothes she is asking you to wear rather than the ones which allow you to show off how perfect you are.\n\nYTA.  You could at least try to be kind.", "YTA and choosing to show up your sister at her wedding.

Get some self awareness lady. \n\nAre you willing to hurt your relationship with your sister for a dress? \n\nLet me be \u201cblunt:\u201d You are shallow and your mom spoiled you. \n\nIf I was your sister and I read this post I\u2019d uninvite you and reconsider the relationship. \n\nTone it down.", "YTA\n\nSo for her whole life, your mother has been bullying and insulting her, you've been basking in your mother's praise and your sister's misery, and now, you want to rub that emotional abuse in her face on what is meant to be the greatest day of her life?\n\nWow. It's clear that you don't care for your sister at all if you can hear what she said and respond with the horrible words you chose. The way you look isn't in your control, but being an AH about it is. And it sounds like you've been an AH and supported your mother being an AH about it for your whole life. But to be clear, your physical body has nothing to do with beauty. This attitude you have? It's he opposite of beautiful.", "Yes, YTA. You could try to be a bit kinder to your sister - it's HER wedding. You and your mom just sound mean, I don't really care about your \"Indian moms can be blunt\" BS excuse. I feel bad for your sister, she's clearly had to deal with nastiness from you two her whole life and now you want to make her feel less than during her own wedding. Maybe you just shouldn't go, since you care so much more about your appearance than your sister's feelings.", "As an Indian, YTA! Indian weddings are extravagant and everyone dresses up, because there is no fear of upstaging the bride. However in your scenario, the bride is dressing down and so should you! You will have your own moment when you get married. And judging by the statements like \u201cfor once\u201d and your statements what will suit her makes you even worse AH! Shows you are the golden child and that your mother pitted you against your sister! I do hope she gets a lovely family, amazing in laws who help boost up her confidence! \n\n\nBtw that lehenga? That can easily be worn by a bride on mehendi function - seems like you deliberately want to appear more bridal than the bride!", "Is she dark/plus size? It seems like that\u2019s why she\u2019s been treated harsh by your mum. YTA", "YTA. It's her wedding, not a fashion show for you. She asked for a toned-down outfit so she can have her moment. It's not about your mom's opinions or your cousins' outfits. Telling her she's insecure on her wedding day? Low blow. It's not about catering to her \"insecurities,\" it's about showing respect.", "YTA\n\nIt's one wedding. Who cares if you wear something \"flattering\" enough for your tastes? Who cares? It's your *sister's* wedding. If wearing something more subdued, as she has requested, ends up not appeasing her after all, oh well, at least you tried. And you can remind her that you did what *she* asked. If she still isn't happy after that, oh well, that's a her problem. But you're not even willing to make any concessions at *all.* Come on, now.", "YTA. In general, a bride's family and attendants take their cue from the bride, normally chosen based in part on the bride's own attire. So it seems very normal and natural that she would find certain outfit choices out of sync with the tone she, as the bride, is setting for the wedding. \n\nReally, grow some compassion. You're just doubling down on harmful, hurtful things your sister has been told by your mother all throughout your upbringing. You're practically patting yourself on the back here for being more attractive of whatever, and it's not a good look. \n\nThis harkens back to Kelly in The Office wearing white to a wedding, as a guest, because \"I look really good in white.\" Guess what - 'what you look best in' is not the only consideration for what you should wear on that day. \n\nNote: I am perceiving this to be comparable to a bridesmaid situation and as a westerner, I'm used to brides literally choosing bridesmaid attire from the dress to the fabric to the color to the length to the accessories.", "My sister would say stuff like this to me. I don't talk to her anymore. It's a bummer, but my life is a lot more pleasant. It's her wedding. Just do her this one small favour.", "Damn. YTA. Have you read what you wrote? You\u2019re literally the woman who wears white to a wedding then wonders why the bride was furious towards you. Get off your high horse and realize the day isn\u2019t about you. It\u2019s about your sister. Would it kill you to not upstage her for once? Wow. With sisters like you, who needs enemies.", "You are actually threatening not to attend?

Between the criticism she receives from your mom you have to dump on her as well. I wish she finds this post and decides to uninvite you from her special day. To also say that the outfit choice she is making tends to look \u201cmatronly and frumpy\u201d is just cruel and continuing the cycle of abuse she has had to experience all her life from your mom. Way to make some low blows. Don\u2019t go if your going to be this much of an AH and ruin her day.", "YTA. My older sister and I have *vastly* different body types; she\u2019s always been thin and I\u2019ve always been curvy (and am now ~4 cup sizes bigger than she is). Ive been insecure about my weight in comparison to her and though she never explicitly stated it, I suspect she was insecure about my curves vs hers.\n\nMy wedding day? She wore exactly what I asked her to cause she was standing beside me during the ceremony without complaint.\n\nShe\u2019s getting married in a few weeks and you know what I did even though they aren\u2019t doing bridesmaids so I\u2019m not standing right next to her? Sent a link of what I wanted to wear to her *and got her approval* before I bought it. \n\nAbove is how you support your damn sibling on one of the most important days of their lives.", "You are doing the equivalent of wearing black tie to an afternoon wedding and ignoring your sisters wishes and happiness on her wedding day because you don\u2019t want to look \u2018frumpy\u2019. I\u2019m sorry that you are so insecure that not looking frumpy is the most important decision-making factor for you. How sad.", "Wait wait wait\u2026. You would actually rather MISS your own sister\u2019s WEDDING than wear a slightly less revealing / flattering outfit??\n\nYou care so much more about how you look than you care about your sister\u2019s wedding? Her feelings? Her comfort on HER big day?\n\nHer wedding is not about YOU, or how YOU look or feel.

This one, shining moment where she doesn\u2019t feel like she has to compete with you or be outshined by you?\n\nDo her a favor and stay home. Who needs enemies with family like this? YTA. Get over yourself.", "YTA. You sound like you don't care that it's her wedding and insulting her for feeling rightfully upstaged. And judging by your responses to people saying YTA, I am firm on this. \n\nSorry girl, from one indian woman to another, you are definitely TA", "YTA. Tradition or not, you know the difference of a wedding day versus a regular day. I\u2019ve been to several Indian weddings and you don\u2019t **have** wear a lehenga, you **want** wear a lehenga. Why not a saree?", "Yes, YTA. \n\nDo you like your sister? You are aware of your mom picking on her for years and making her feel inferior and you are using that as an excuse to join in on it? Why can't you set aside just a few days in her life to let her feel special and beautiful?", "You didn't care what the verdict was, you came here for people to validate your opinion and tell you it was the right thing to do. It wasn't, YTA. Everyone agrees and you just keep doubling down to justify you being a terrible sister. It is the Bride and Grooms day, not yours. If your sister is uncomfortable with your outfit choices IT DOES NOT MATTER if she's got a problem with the cousins and other guests wearing similar. Insecure or not is irrelevant. It is the bride and grooms day first and foremost, respect her wishes or don't attend.", "[removed]", "YTA. Fellow Indian lady here, if my sister/cousin/bestie or anyone close to me made this request I would happily oblige, even if it\u2019s not the best look on me. It\u2019s the same as if an American bride were to request long dresses and no short dresses at her wedding, or a Muslim bride were to request modest clothing covering arms and legs and midriff - it\u2019s a bit unusual but it\u2019s their special day! You aren\u2019t just a random guest, you\u2019re her sister and it would look odd if you\u2019re dressed up more than her, and people will pay far more attention to you than other random guests who may be wearing similar.", "Yta. This gives the ick. You care more about your appearance than your own sister and her special day.  It\u2019s the equivalent of wearing white to a traditional wedding. Gives me pick me vibes, you\u2019re not a girls girl. You\u2019re a mean girl. Would never be friends with you in real life. Grow up and care about your sisters biggest day ever or prepare for a huge fallout, if I were your sister I would cut you off. The disrespect and self centeredness is loud here.", "YTA.  You have chosen an outfit that screams look at me, look at me on a day that should be all about your sister.", "YTA and this reeks of r/IAmTheMainCharacter. Sounds like your mother plays favourites and you just go along with it being the mean sister. You can't even compromise and let her have her day.

You can adjust your clothes for one event.", "Indian also, and you my friend are the big asshole here. Its your sisters day, not yours. Dress down for goodness sake.

Why didn't you speak about your outfits to your sis during this process instead of just going ahead and buying them/getting them made. YtA", "YTA. You are the biggest asshole of a sister I have ever seen in real life. You sound like those jealous sisters who want to one up their own sister just to satisfy your bloody ego.

You suck!", "INFO: I\u2019ve never heard of a desi bride getting married in a salwar suit. That\u2019s too simple to wear for an Indian wedding, and typically chosen by people who are not too close to the family. People closer to the family are usually dressed up in saris, lehengas and other traditionally dressy clothing. \n\nYou mention being different body types. Are you saying your sister is larger and therefore choosing to wear a salwar suit ?", "Yta as an Indian because you can dress not to upstage", "YTA\n\nYou are clearly going to outshine the bride and pouting that you won't even go if you wear a suit tells me everything I need to know about your maturity level.\n\nHow about a compromise?  Two suits and two lehengas?\n\nYour mom is also a complete AH for body shaming your sister her whole life and making her insecure.  Don't be like your mom.  Support your sister on her wedding day even when her own mother won't.\n\nPS.  \"Blunt\" is an excuse AH's give to justify their assholery.  Your mom is just an AH.", "YTA and a bad sister", "Hey, I know from personal experience just how complicated familial relationships can be in an Indian American household. I think there's bigger issues at play here - you mentioned that you think the underlying source of the conflict is that your sister's body image has been strongly affected by your mom's comments/comparisons and I believe in your comments you've said that you don't feel comfortable with your future BIL. So there's already a quite a lot of strain between you and your sister and I obviously can't know the full history there. But what I would say is: \n\nI don't disagree with you - your lehenga is quite common/appropriate for desi weddings. But at the same time, I do think that your priority should be making sure your sister feels celebrated at her own wedding. You obviously have the freedom/right to dress as you want. But in the wider context of the wedding being attended by desi guests- who can be quite judgy/potentially toxic - for the sake of the relationship with your sister, dressing out of your comfort zone might be a sacrifice you have to make (if you want to maintain a good relationship). Bc ultimately the day is about her. And it is unfair to both you and your sister that social judgement is interfering with the day and I understand your frustration. But I also sympathize with your sister because everyone's journey with unpacking trauma is different. What helps with that journey is support and empathy and compassion. \n\nIs it not possible to meet halfway? Maybe a simpler lehenga or a suit that you feel is slightly more flattering (I think palazzos and all are RLY in right now)? At the very least I think you need to have a honest conversation with your sister, centered around how you want to support her on her big day -  not about your dressing preferences (keep that aside for now). And then if that goes positively, maybe you guys can reach a consensus on how you can best support her and how your dressing preferences can be incorporated. \n\nGood luck, I hope you and your sister are able to work things out:)", "You\u2019re so deep in your own shit, your own AH is begging for mercy.

But if she wants solidarity, as her sister, on her wedding day, you should give her that. Keep in mind you will be standing next to her more than any of your cousins will.

Be supportive and hype her up. Brutal honesty never ever helps someone self esteem to be better, because you're only confirming what she fears and making it worse. Consider it from her perspective: you want to wear this style, because you think suits are frumpy. So she'll hear that you find her frumpy and this will only confirm her fears she's indeed frumpy and will never be able to pull of anything more than a frumpy suit no matter how much bedazzled it is. Instead you could have told her it doesn't matter what you'll wear, because she's the bride and she has the perfect suit and she's going to look so perfect and nobody is even going to look at you.

There will be wedding guests out dressing you if you wear what she wants.

OP, sounds ugly inside and that shines outwards unfortunately for her.\n\nHer sister sounds very insecure for good reason but probably a really nice person who will do much better overall in life than her vain sister, who maybe isn\u2019t even as attractive as she thinks she is, she\u2019s just been getting upvotes and likes from her mother for a long time.", "That's what I thought I have seen people wearing this kind of lehenga or extravagant sarees to someone else's wedding. If bride is insecure she should go for lehengas or some extravagant suit. There are many with heavy embroidery work. I am with OP here bride's insecurities are not for her to address.", "The OPs planned outfit has nothing covering the midriff, looks more like a shawl. OP Definitely comes across as \u201cpick me\u201d in this outfit.", "I\u2019m sure they thank the fianc\u00e9 for marrying the \u2018ugly\u2019 daughter.", "Once mom dies, sis may yet go NC. I hope she does. I'm rooting for her.", "I agree, I looked at it and said I would wear that!", "I was the last to get married of my friends and told all my bridesmaids I was going to make them wear MY bridesmaids dresses from THEIR wedding. \ud83d\ude02half of them said YAY and the other half\u2026finally realized what they\u2019d done to us. Hhahaha.", "Only time I ever complained about a bridesmaid dress was when it was way too revealing on me. The rest of the bridal party was fairly flat chested and I had DD to DDD chest. I was a late addition (another bridesmaid dropped out last minute and she was left in the lurch). The dress didn\u2019t look terrible on me but also not great either\u2026  I still wore it. Only thing I requested was that I could put a small lace privacy panel in the bust area. It was not noticeable but concealed the fact I was basically spilling out of the dress. Bride was a bit apprehensive but once she saw the before and the alteration she completely agreed it needed to happen and was far less noticeable then the alternative. It wasn\u2019t about being different and standing out but rather the alternative.", "I\u2019m laughing my butt off picturing bridegrooms and bridesmaids wearing potato sacks while posing for the wedding pictures \ud83d\ude02", "Yes!! You wear what the bride tells you unless there is a medical or religious (modesty) problem!! Or unless the bride wants you to make semi-permanent changes (hair dye) which shows they don\u2019t respect you as a friend.", "Same. I remember my sister\u2019s wedding was evidence of this. I was her maid of honor and wore the dress she wanted me to wear. I bought the heels she requested and asked if after the ceremony I could change into flats since they\u2019re \u201cmore comfortable\u201d, but honestly it was because she was insecure about her height since she\u2019s only 4\u201911 and I didn\u2019t want to seem taller than normal (5\u20192). I didn\u2019t even get my makeup done like her bridesmaids did because ever since we were kids, she has always worried that I\u2019m skinnier (though that has definitely changed!) and our family would complement me more than her, so I made damn sure to let her have her spotlight. \n\nFunny enough though, she refused to go to my wedding. I had always let her walk all over me throughout our lives because I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad and putting me down helped her with that so I just went with it. It saddens me though that she could never be supportive of me the way I have always been to her. Even now, I pay for her daughter\u2019s childcare and help pay for her monthly bills, but she couldn\u2019t be bothered to attend my wedding. I only invited 15 people by the way, didn\u2019t invite anyone else in my family but her, and she STILL didn\u2019t go.", "Yeah but those women wont be standing *next to the bride*", "I don't know much about the culture, but I can get behind this statement. Maybe it *wasn't* so much that she wanted to outshine her sister, but she absolutely didn't have to turn around and tell her sister how insecure she is.", "\"i went to my mum because I knew she'd agree with me and gang up on my sister so it should be fine right, why do I have to care if my sister is happy on her wedding day, mummy says it's fine if I upstage her so I'm going to\".\n\nYeah, and she's still unironically asking if she's the asshole.", "I mean personally I love my sister and will wear whatever she wants for her wedding or even a birthday. But agreed banning lehenga is just a really weird request when there will be dozens if not hundreds of women in lehengas ....it's one thing to want to stand out as a bride it's another thing to deliberately dress your younger sister in something only aunties and grandmas usually wear so she'll look less attractive. It seems lihe she's singling out her sister and I can see why OP would have an issue.", "That's not how it works in our culture.", "And even if she\u2019s the most beautiful woman in the world that night\u2014 no one will think it makes up for that shitty behavior. People won\u2019t even need to know there was an argument or that her sister didn\u2019t want her to wear lehengas\u2014 they\u2019ll think she\u2019s upstaging on purpose and mock her for it on the way out.

I commend the friends that wear ugly dresses out of love and I expect nothing less from a good friend. But having the bridal party, with people that are supposed to love and support you wear ugly dresses so you\u2019re not out shined reeks of insecurity. It\u2019s a wild ask. There is something really sad and ugly about needing others to look bad so you feel and see yourself as beautiful. Especially when what makes a bride beautiful on her wedding day is that her joy and spirit are palpable.", "I hope you keep her at arm\u2019s length! I think it\u2019s pretty damn awful that she did not attend your wedding of 15 people. Did she have a really good reason??? I feel indignant at the very thought of this. Maybe it\u2019s time for you see a therapist about this relationship (((I say this with kindness))), you are still giving and she is still taking. That\u2019s not a friendship that sounds healthy.", "I have a sister like that. She\u2019s forever punishing me for real and perceived slights.", "Her sister is trying to call her fat without blatantly looking like an asshole, was my take on it.", "Exactly! The sister knows her mom\u2019s been putting down the bride since forever. Wouldn\u2019t hurt her to show some love & let the bride shine on her wedding day.", "OP is the mom's golden child, sister is the scapegoat...and it shows.", "If I know anything about Indian weddings, nothing about them is small. Not a single thing", "Because OP and her mum have made the sister feel ugly her whole life so she's dressing down because she's ashamed of herself thanks to their treatment. So on this one day in her entire life she'd like her sister to not stand out as the beautiful thin stunning one and OP can't take a single day not being the golden child.\n\nThe rest of the guests there aren't their mothers child nor have been called the ugly sister their whole life so they aren't involved here. She wants one day her closest family make her feel better than her sister, on her wedding, and OP think's that's too much to ask.", "You don't know anyone 35 below that wears a suit? I find that extremely difficult to believe. I am under 35. I own several. So do my friends. And my neighbours. I have cousins that are literal teenagers. They own suits. Their friends do too.\n\nSuits are as popular as ever. Just Google the name of any Indian actress under 30 and add 'in a suit'. Google Sabyasachi or Manish Malhotra suit collection.", "That\u2019s honestly what I am most worried about. \nIt seems OP commented somewhere that her sisters fianc\u00e9 was creepy to her (she edited the comment though) so I feel worst case might be that the sister is getting married off to some Incel creep (that even prefers OP like everyone seems to) for her family\u2019s profit (whatever that may be, I never got the whole arranged marriage shtick). \n\nI am certainly reading to much into it at this point which is why I hadn\u2019t originally mentioned it but after now having read about how OP is in a committed relationship and not married.. it feels a bit like she as the golden child is allowed to take a \u201emore western\u201c approach to life and have a boyfriend while her \u201eugly duckling\u201c sister gets married off. I wouldn\u2019t even put it past OP and their mother to use the sister potentially not having had a relationship before and being well.. not the \u201epretty one\u201c against her to make her agree to the arranged marriage. \n\nWould fit right in with the whole \u201ethere are so many flattering Indian formal wear it seems she chose the specific suit because she was made to believe she\u2019d only look decent in that specific cut\u201c-theory.\n\nObviously almost all of that is pure speculation. But considering the \u201eclues\u201c and OPs overall despicable behavior.. I kinda believe my theories to at least be reasonable.", "Haha me too man. To be fair I did get years of good use out of one of them, early nineties frilly lacy white satin with green bows flower girl dress from my cousins wedding. It became a mainstay when I discovered that my little brother was amenable to being dressed up! He rocked that awful dress until his early teens (bribery/threats sometimes required). I wonder if it is still in a closet somewhere in my parents house.", "I told my entire bridal party they should also look amazing because I don\u2019t like to be the center of attention so they have to take some of that on for me", "A lot of times it\u2019s not deliberate. I recently had a bride choose two colors, one of which I don\u2019t think she realized would look bad on most skin types. I got to choose the nicer color but my dress was kind of ugly because anything that I really liked was not going to be ready in time for the wedding. So I didn\u2019t look great, but some things are out of a brides hands. She let us choose our style but asked for final approval.

The smiles of those women, the absolute divine beauty that shines through them because they know they\u2019re the belle of the god damned ball\u2026 it was everything I needed today. I hope OPs sis can feel that as well, no matter what she wears. She deserves to have her starshine moment.", "Right?!?  Honestly?  I live a couple hours from DC and there is a decent number of older South Asian women who wear lehengas at the malls and shops I will go to. I love seeing the grandmas and aunties wearing them, especially the wee plump nanas who wear bright ones. No shrinking violets when it comes to clothing and the outfits are always so well fitted. So pretty and I always smile when I see people wearing awesome clothing that suits them.", "The hotel I work at has Indian weddings sometimes.

Then Op is really despicable even in a higher level.", "Some of the \"ugly\" dresses are either all that the shops were selling at the time (looking at you, 80s era bridesmaid's dresses) or the best compromise for a variety of body types.

Obviously context matters, but in general, so long as you're not wearing it as a costume or a caricature, and are genuinely vibing with it as a beautiful item of clothing, most Indian people I've spoken to have zero problem with white people wearing them. The groom's white family and groomsmen of many backgrounds all wore Indian lehengas/sarees/suits, and they looked amazing too. \n\nWhen I was little, my mum's Indian friend even stitched me a child's saree as a present! It was blue and gold.\n\nThere's a huge difference between wearing one as a racist Halloween costume and wearing one as part of a celebration with Indian people. That's one of the reasons I imported one from India - I wanted to wear the real deal, and pay for the privilege, rather than show up in a cheap imitation that would look like an embarrassing mockery. \n\nThe clothing is absolutely beautiful, and if I ever moved to India, I'd drop western clothing day to day in a heartbeat.", "I\u2019ve always hated the idea of cultural appropriation.

She didn\u2019t look out of place at all and she was rocking the hell out of the lehenga. \n\nMy gf is Asian and her sister loves black hair to the point where she was considering trying dreads or cornrows but she was asking me for \u201cpermission\u201d cos she thinks it\u2019s cultural appropriation. I told her to dress however she wants to as long as she isn\u2019t doing it mockingly. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is that as someone belonging  cultures, there is no such thing as cultural appropriation if you are being respectful. I see it as a nod to that particular culture and a direct expression of your interest and appreciation of it.", "I can't fathom in any way, shape of fashion that you would be criticized for cultural appropriation for wearing any style of Indian dress, by anyone of Indian descent.

Truly wonderful for someone like me who had no prior experience wearing one and had to get ready without help from an auntie! All custom made to my exact measurements, including the exact part of my waist I wanted it to sit on and the length I wanted. It even came with multiple eyelet sets within the underskirt to accommodate weight gain or loss, and a tie at the waist to cinch it in. \n\nYou can even get the shoulder fabric draped and stitched, too! But I left mine loose as I wanted to be able to wrap it to cover my stomach up if I got self conscious (in the end I never did because the seamstress made it out of actual magic, I'm not normally one to bare midriff but it looked so good on me I never once felt exposed!).", "Honestly the comments here alone would be enough for me personally to go No contact if I was the sister, but I bet that\u2019s not that easy.\nEspecially after enduring ~30 years with a Mum and sister like that.\nAnd maybe not even knowing quite how vile OP speaks behind her back.", "tysm for the detailed explanation and the links!
