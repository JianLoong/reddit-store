It doesn't mean that you have to change that decision, but a new compromise that both are happy with should be the end result. And you're not doing that, you're just doggedly pointing at the prior agreement. That is a pretty bad way to manage practical matters is a committed relationship because things change over time.\n\nNormally I'd leave it at that and label you the bad guy.
