If yes then it would be great if you could voluntarily cover more than 50%. Supporting each other in every way makes for a healthy loving relationship. \nBut I think it\u2019s not right of her to demand that you pay more now just so she can save more. You have to establish first that she is not entitled to your money just as you are not entitled to hers. You are not married yet. But if you\u2019re looking into marrying your gf sometime in the future you both have to work on this issue. Would it really matter if you lessen her burden a bit? Going forward you should talk things through and make another agreement. Like some of the others have said, starting now you could agree to split the bill according to how much you both are earning. \n\nI think NTA. GF should be genuinely happy about your promotion and your salary increase, but instead of demanding that you increase your share in the household expenses she should have talked to you sincerely instead of throwing words like \u201cunfair\u201d I think she\u2019s somewhat gaslighting you to get her way. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me.

I suggest not sharing how much you\u2019re making with her to begin with, as it\u2019s going to create issues. I would also suggest you tell her you don\u2019t see a future with her so that she can plan accordingly and decide if she\u2019s okay with that (and if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re definitely TA for dragging her along).\n\nIf you want to build a life with her, you need to come to openly discuss finances, and frequently adjust as things change. As the difference in your incomes widen, she wants a more equitable split in bills. This is common and reasonable. Either way you\u2019re a team - if you\u2019d be willing to pick up extra slack on things like eating out as you mention in a comment below, why would you not be willing to just split bills more equitably in the first place as it works out essentially the same?

If you're earning an extra couple of hundred pounds a month then that's great.
