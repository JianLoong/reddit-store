She was the intern of a different department of the company I worked for when I met her. We dated for a few years. We both bought \"children\" into our relationship. She met this struggling teen (we're going to call A) and she kind of adopted her as her own. My adopted daughter I met when she was a middle school and I adopted her when she was 18. My adopted daughter was abandoned by her so called mother when she was barely 13 and that was around the time that I met her. Due to previous relationship with my ex-wife being an alcoholic and my sister abusive husband. I ended up kind of neglecting her. There was a time where she was hurt and needed me and I prioritized my sister and my wife over her. Which only reinforced the idea that she's not anyone's priority. I made a promise to her that she was my priority and that she would always be as my child. Anyways, All of us and some friends were playing a game and somehow we got to playing, would you rather about our co-workers and somehow that led to me being asked what I save my pregnant wife or would I save my adopted daughter? I stated that I'd save my daughter every time over. It upset A to hear that I would choose my daughter over my wife and child stating that it didn't make sense that I wasn't choosing my own blood. My friend Jay says I'm asshole because I made the choice when I shouldn't have. My wife didn't say anything but I could tell that her feelings were hurt.
