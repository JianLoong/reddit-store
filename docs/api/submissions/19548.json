The wedding ceremony is at 6PM. She also initially said she would only be providing bagels for breakfast but when I inquired if lunch would be provided, she said maybe someone could pick up In N Out (seemed like there wasn't really a plan to feed us while we are being asked to hang out for 9+ hrs. at the airbnb she & her groom rented). Sharing the airbnb to get ready with the men is also not my taste but in the grand scheme of my issues with the schedule, I'm willing to let that fall lower on my complaint list. There is worry this is an excuse for a pre-party to drink, & with lack of food, the fact I can't drink due to me being in the process of IVF, & the longer we are all asked to be couped up in the airbnb, that's more hrs. there are to kill with shots, etc. \n\nI think this is way too early to have this work done or to have everyone arrive based on personal wedding experience & also what various wedding sites suggest. So many things I can see going wrong from the bridal parties being sloshed before the wedding to all our hair/makeup getting ruined because it was completed way too early, no touch ups provided, & things like noshing on In N Out are not really condusive to keeping teeth/breath/lipstick up to par. The last wedding I was a bridesmaid for that had a 7PM start had us arrive at 11:45AM to begin the getting ready process & even in that instance my hair began to wilt around ceremony time.\n\nNote: I haven't attended any of the bridal events (Bachelorette, showers, etc.) since I live out of state but have sent gifts for every event in lieu of not attending. This makes it feel a bit awkward to poke at the wedding schedule the bride made when it feels like I should just show up & do as I'm told but I'm not a fan of she & I dropping money on hair/makeup that will not last until ceremony time. The wedding is outside in July in the Bay Area so it will be hot. I sent a couple texts to test the waters asking if any touch ups would be provided to make our hair/makeup last until 6PM. Was told for her makeup/hair trial that everything she had done lasted all day. Gave the vibe that things are set in stone so show up when I said, though any woman who wears basic makeup knows at the end of the day it does not look wedding ready let alone how it looked when you applied it that morning.\n\nAlso Note: future MIL/SIL seem to be dictating the schedule of the getting ready process but I didn't poke too much since it seemed to be a sore spot for the bride. All I know is they are driving hours out of the way to have their hair specially done in SF but they requested the prime makeup slots (even over the bride's). They are also apparently notoriously late & of the mind that the world revolves around their schedule. Though they are the groom's family, they are not in the wedding party so this is another aspect of why the schedule feels a bit out of hand.", "created_utc": 1686498305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146x788/aita_bridesmaid_for_not_wanting_to_arrive_for/", "score": 63, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not around organizing anything or helping the bride with this stuff, so you just have to show up and do what you're told for a day. It might not be ideal, but it is what it is. Clearly the bride's hands are full dealing with her in-laws and everything else that goes along with planning a wedding, so you \"poking\" at things will do more harm than help. Pack a lunch or plan on ordering pizza.", "YTA.  Don't agree to be in a wedding party of you aren't prepped for an all day thing.

Don\u2019t drink but have your phone so you can sneak out and talk to your husband, watch movies, etc. just don\u2019t forget to acknowledge the bride and ask her if she needs anything once in a while. That\u2019ll avoid any negative attention when your phone is \u201cdistracting\u201d you from your bridesmaid \u201cduties\u201d.

Yeah, this is a bit long of a wedding day schedule, but doesn't seem that crazy.  I've always assumed that when in a wedding party you block off the entire day of the wedding and just expect to be there - even if that means sitting around for a decent part of the day.  There are lots of moving pieces (hair, pictures, etc.) so sometimes there will be dead time for certain people.

What matters most is what works for the bride and groom. If this schedule is fine with them, it needs to be fine with you. It\u2019s not right for you to criticize the logistics of this wedding when you\u2019ve been such a hands off bridesmaid. Your concern about lunch is valid so speak with the other bridesmaids about coordinating a group lunch order that afternoon.", "INFO: have you asked the bride what she thinks?

Why even agree to be in the bridal party if you didn\u2019t want to do anything?", "NTA you and the bride agreed you wouldn't be at the pre wedding stuff so I don't even understand why people are getting so mad about that. I was a bridesmaid may 22 and if the bride had suggested such an early hair n makeup appointment for a 6pm ceremony I'd of brought up the fact that neither the hair or makeup will look good by then. I'd want her to have the best day but also to have the best pics to look back on that day.

I, too have an amazing friend who I love dearly whose wedding was an absolute gong show -  7 start for everyone, 18 women in a small 1.5br condo, no place to sit (literally no furniture in the place) for 9 hours, no food except breakfast nibblies, and the care of a 9 month old while the groom on his own (with zero attendants on his side) occupied an entire hotel catering suite instead.   Didn\u2019t eat from about 11am until 9:30 when the dinner took place. It was an incredibly long and aggravating day, but sometimes you do things for friends. Put on your best smile and meditation tracks, bring a ton of snacks and drinks for yourself and set your eyes on the prize of pulling out the Bobby pins and taking off the makeup at the end of the day and venting to your spouse about it. This too shall pass.", "NTA. This is an unrealistic expectation, especially if she has no plans to feed you throughout the day. Not being at the other events is a nonissue, as the only thing you really need to be at is the wedding. If you do go along with this crazy schedule, don\u2019t go out of your way or inconvenience yourself to make sure hair and makeup stay perfect. Don\u2019t intentionally sabotage it, but don\u2019t sit as still as a statue to preserve it either. If hair wilts or makeup fades through out the course of the day as you move about and get ready and eat\u2026well, the bride can\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t warned.", "YTA\n\nyour reasoning is valid, its just that ,its is not your wedding and you agreed to whatever. why rock the boat on the actual day just to get your own way? otherwise ditch it.", "YTA\n\nAll I'm getting is you don't want to wake up early.\n\nEven if it were 10 AM, that's still plenty of time for people to get sloshed and eat  foods that will ruin the make up before the ceremony.  All of which is not your problem, and you also can decide whether to drink or not.", "NTA\n\nYou are gonna eat TWO meals after makeup? What\u2019s the point of doing it at all?", "NTA I don't know much about make up but it's not gonna last all day without touching it up. Right?", "NTA\n\nI am a huge believer that once you agree to be in someone's wedding, you are essentially saying \"this is YOUR day and my day now belongs to you\". But.. within reason. Would you be able to get your hair and makeup done elsewhere and then show up at a more appropriate time?\n\nI know it might not feel good to exclude yourself once more, since you haven't been to the pre-wedding stuff, but you can make that up easily at the wedding and especially at the reception, where I have found is when the bride needs the most support.\n\nMake sure she has a blast. Make sure other people are enjoying themselves. If no one is dancing, try to get people on the dance floor. Make sure the bride is drinking enough water and not just alcohol. Make sure she gets to eat, because even though a meal is served generally, the bride and groom usually go around greeting guests during dinner.\n\nAs far as her part in the hair/make-up situation.. you brought up your concerns and she said it will be okay. She's an adult and she can make her own decisions. Though, it would be great if you brought some makeup, hairspray, pins, etc. to provide assistance if things do start to go downhill.\n\nEssentially.. just be helpful during the time that actually matters and things should be totally fine. I've been a bridesmaid in literally 11 weddings. One of which I was the maid of honor, two others, I was the acting maid of honor, but the person's sister was the standing maid of honor.", "I\u2019m torn between ESH and YTA. \n\nShe 100% should have planned lunch for you guys. But that\u2019s a really easy thing to forget about when you\u2019re worried about literally everything else. I was in a wedding a month ago and I was legit hangry by the time dinner was served. So although it\u2019s an easy oversight, it can easily ruin the mood for the entire wedding party. \n\nThat\u2019s her only transgression here. \n\nShow up at 7, get ready and shut up if you\u2019re not gonna be supportive. \n\nIt\u2019s beyond me why she would ask you to be a maid when you live out of state in the first place, but I\u2019d bet my life that she\u2019ll regret asking you if you open your mouth to complain.

It\u2019s not unreasonable.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nBeing in a bridal party these days is a whole lot of hassle, both financially and generally. Maybe your bride is typical and maybe she's a little much, but either way I think you had a basic idea of what you were getting in for when you agreed.\n\nShow up, take whatever non-prime spot they assign you, bring a protein shake or something light to eat, and hope for the best with your hair and makeup.

You don\u2019t have to pay for everyone\u2019s lunch out of pocket but you could volunteer to place the order and have everyone who wants food to give you the money beforehand.", "Have you ever thought to just doordash? YTA", "It doesn't seem right to you or me, but we have no idea what else may be involved. If you have someone you can speak with, it shouldn't hurt to ask just in case there is something they want to reconsider. In the end though, the bride and groom are in charge and have the right to make decisions that you don't think are good choices.\n\nThere's nothing you can do about other people's choices such as drinking. All you can do is stay sober yourself.\n\nPack a good book or two, some snacks, cash/card to order your own food if needed, an extra battery plus cable and plug for your phone, etc to make sure that you are as comfortable as possible.", "This isn\u2019t being a diva. You\u2019re being a diva. Your friend has been plenty flexible for you to be in this wedding and now you\u2019re still not satisfied. Do your friend a favor and drop out so she doesn\u2019t have to deal with your drama on her wedding day. She\u2019s done plenty for you. Suck it up and be there to support her. No one cars if you can\u2019t drink. You don\u2019t like the food, bring your own. Have a setting spray and beauty blender on hand to spritz. Bring extra lipstick.\n\nThe world does not revolve around your wants", "Did it ever occur to you that perhaps she wants everyone to come early so everyone can spend time together? Maybe she just wants to hang out with her friends before the wedding! Why does that seem like such a hardship for you?", "So she wants you guys there that early for a \"girls night out\" during the day kind of thing?", "While I can see the point about it being hypocritical to set the schedule from my end, at least I'm in the wedding party vs. these other people dictating the schedule are not. I also am not insisting that I have a better time slot then the bride but I haven't pushed that point because clearly if the bride is okay sacrificing her time for the future in laws that's her battle to pick or not.", "I have not but this was agreed upon beforehand when I was asked to be a bridesmaid. She knew I'd be undergoing IVF during this time so we made sure to be in agreement that I wouldn't be able to drink or attend pre-wedding events due to cost/schedule/living out of state. I provided gifts for her events despite me not being able to be present. I also was the only bridesmaid who bought my dress to save her money instead of having her buy it like the other bridesmaids. Those were really the only opportunities up to this point I've had to impact the bride in my role at all.", "She never said she wasn\u2019t going to interact with anyone. She just needs some advice on how to handle a situation that really isn\u2019t going to go well for the foreseeable future.  She is being perfectly reasonable and doesn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat person\u201d that doubts the whole day. It won\u2019t be fun for her, it\u2019s the whole day and she knows exactly what is going to end up happening because she has seen/experienced this before. So she needs a couple of back up plans in case things go south and it\u2019s not a day that is completely ruined and wasted since she can\u2019t really participate in the festivities the same way others are going to.", "I'm assuming yes & since the groom/groomsmen are getting ready there too, it seems like a big pre-party? There is nothing else planned after the hair/makeup getting done first thing in the morning. She doesn't even want us including herself getting in our attire there but wants us to do that at the venue (makes sense) right before ceremony at 6PM.", "The fact that you seem to genuinely not understand why the *brides own in-laws* would outrank you, the relatively uninvolved bridesmaid, says a lot more about you than it does about them.", "Your inability to not drink is on you, it sounds like your friend has been plenty flexible with you and it\u2019s still not enough", "I don't know why people are being so hostile towards you. You're right. It's a bad schedule, but you aren't going to be able to change anything since the stylist is booked. It's possible that the bride sacrificed a reasonable time for hair and makeup for getting the stylist she wanted or something like that. \n\nLook at it this way, it's not your wedding, the only thing you have to do is show up. If the hair and makeup aren't great by wedding time, no big deal. It doesn't really affect you other than having some wilty hair and faded makeup.\n\nETA: bring something to do/easy to eat regardless because you will have a lot of downtime.", "Only thing left to do is get drunk and throw up just as she says I DO"]}
