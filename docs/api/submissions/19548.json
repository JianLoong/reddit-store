The wedding ceremony is at 6PM. She also initially said she would only be providing bagels for breakfast but when I inquired if lunch would be provided, she said maybe someone could pick up In N Out (seemed like there wasn't really a plan to feed us while we are being asked to hang out for 9+ hrs. at the airbnb she & her groom rented). Sharing the airbnb to get ready with the men is also not my taste but in the grand scheme of my issues with the schedule, I'm willing to let that fall lower on my complaint list. There is worry this is an excuse for a pre-party to drink, & with lack of food, the fact I can't drink due to me being in the process of IVF, & the longer we are all asked to be couped up in the airbnb, that's more hrs. there are to kill with shots, etc. \n\nI think this is way too early to have this work done or to have everyone arrive based on personal wedding experience & also what various wedding sites suggest. So many things I can see going wrong from the bridal parties being sloshed before the wedding to all our hair/makeup getting ruined because it was completed way too early, no touch ups provided, & things like noshing on In N Out are not really condusive to keeping teeth/breath/lipstick up to par. The last wedding I was a bridesmaid for that had a 7PM start had us arrive at 11:45AM to begin the getting ready process & even in that instance my hair began to wilt around ceremony time.\n\nNote: I haven't attended any of the bridal events (Bachelorette, showers, etc.) since I live out of state but have sent gifts for every event in lieu of not attending. This makes it feel a bit awkward to poke at the wedding schedule the bride made when it feels like I should just show up & do as I'm told but I'm not a fan of she & I dropping money on hair/makeup that will not last until ceremony time. The wedding is outside in July in the Bay Area so it will be hot. I sent a couple texts to test the waters asking if any touch ups would be provided to make our hair/makeup last until 6PM. Was told for her makeup/hair trial that everything she had done lasted all day. Gave the vibe that things are set in stone so show up when I said, though any woman who wears basic makeup knows at the end of the day it does not look wedding ready let alone how it looked when you applied it that morning.\n\nAlso Note: future MIL/SIL seem to be dictating the schedule of the getting ready process but I didn't poke too much since it seemed to be a sore spot for the bride. All I know is they are driving hours out of the way to have their hair specially done in SF but they requested the prime makeup slots (even over the bride's). They are also apparently notoriously late & of the mind that the world revolves around their schedule. Though they are the groom's family, they are not in the wedding party so this is another aspect of why the schedule feels a bit out of hand.", "created_utc": 1686498305, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146x788/aita_bridesmaid_for_not_wanting_to_arrive_for/", "score": 258, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not around organizing anything or helping the bride with this stuff, so you just have to show up and do what you're told for a day. It might not be ideal, but it is what it is. Clearly the bride's hands are full dealing with her in-laws and everything else that goes along with planning a wedding, so you \"poking\" at things will do more harm than help. Pack a lunch or plan on ordering pizza.", "YTA.  Don't agree to be in a wedding party of you aren't prepped for an all day thing.

Don\u2019t drink but have your phone so you can sneak out and talk to your husband, watch movies, etc. just don\u2019t forget to acknowledge the bride and ask her if she needs anything once in a while. That\u2019ll avoid any negative attention when your phone is \u201cdistracting\u201d you from your bridesmaid \u201cduties\u201d.

Yeah, this is a bit long of a wedding day schedule, but doesn't seem that crazy.  I've always assumed that when in a wedding party you block off the entire day of the wedding and just expect to be there - even if that means sitting around for a decent part of the day.  There are lots of moving pieces (hair, pictures, etc.) so sometimes there will be dead time for certain people.

What matters most is what works for the bride and groom. If this schedule is fine with them, it needs to be fine with you. It\u2019s not right for you to criticize the logistics of this wedding when you\u2019ve been such a hands off bridesmaid. Your concern about lunch is valid so speak with the other bridesmaids about coordinating a group lunch order that afternoon.", "INFO: have you asked the bride what she thinks?

Why even agree to be in the bridal party if you didn\u2019t want to do anything?", "NTA you and the bride agreed you wouldn't be at the pre wedding stuff so I don't even understand why people are getting so mad about that. I was a bridesmaid may 22 and if the bride had suggested such an early hair n makeup appointment for a 6pm ceremony I'd of brought up the fact that neither the hair or makeup will look good by then. I'd want her to have the best day but also to have the best pics to look back on that day.

I, too have an amazing friend who I love dearly whose wedding was an absolute gong show -  7 start for everyone, 18 women in a small 1.5br condo, no place to sit (literally no furniture in the place) for 9 hours, no food except breakfast nibblies, and the care of a 9 month old while the groom on his own (with zero attendants on his side) occupied an entire hotel catering suite instead.   Didn\u2019t eat from about 11am until 9:30 when the dinner took place. It was an incredibly long and aggravating day, but sometimes you do things for friends. Put on your best smile and meditation tracks, bring a ton of snacks and drinks for yourself and set your eyes on the prize of pulling out the Bobby pins and taking off the makeup at the end of the day and venting to your spouse about it. This too shall pass.", "NTA. This is an unrealistic expectation, especially if she has no plans to feed you throughout the day. Not being at the other events is a nonissue, as the only thing you really need to be at is the wedding. If you do go along with this crazy schedule, don\u2019t go out of your way or inconvenience yourself to make sure hair and makeup stay perfect. Don\u2019t intentionally sabotage it, but don\u2019t sit as still as a statue to preserve it either. If hair wilts or makeup fades through out the course of the day as you move about and get ready and eat\u2026well, the bride can\u2019t say she wasn\u2019t warned.", "YTA\n\nyour reasoning is valid, its just that ,its is not your wedding and you agreed to whatever. why rock the boat on the actual day just to get your own way? otherwise ditch it.", "YTA\n\nAll I'm getting is you don't want to wake up early.\n\nEven if it were 10 AM, that's still plenty of time for people to get sloshed and eat  foods that will ruin the make up before the ceremony.  All of which is not your problem, and you also can decide whether to drink or not.", "NTA\n\nYou are gonna eat TWO meals after makeup? What\u2019s the point of doing it at all?", "NTA I don't know much about make up but it's not gonna last all day without touching it up. Right?", "NTA\n\nI am a huge believer that once you agree to be in someone's wedding, you are essentially saying \"this is YOUR day and my day now belongs to you\". But.. within reason. Would you be able to get your hair and makeup done elsewhere and then show up at a more appropriate time?\n\nI know it might not feel good to exclude yourself once more, since you haven't been to the pre-wedding stuff, but you can make that up easily at the wedding and especially at the reception, where I have found is when the bride needs the most support.\n\nMake sure she has a blast. Make sure other people are enjoying themselves. If no one is dancing, try to get people on the dance floor. Make sure the bride is drinking enough water and not just alcohol. Make sure she gets to eat, because even though a meal is served generally, the bride and groom usually go around greeting guests during dinner.\n\nAs far as her part in the hair/make-up situation.. you brought up your concerns and she said it will be okay. She's an adult and she can make her own decisions. Though, it would be great if you brought some makeup, hairspray, pins, etc. to provide assistance if things do start to go downhill.\n\nEssentially.. just be helpful during the time that actually matters and things should be totally fine. I've been a bridesmaid in literally 11 weddings. One of which I was the maid of honor, two others, I was the acting maid of honor, but the person's sister was the standing maid of honor.", "I\u2019m torn between ESH and YTA. \n\nShe 100% should have planned lunch for you guys. But that\u2019s a really easy thing to forget about when you\u2019re worried about literally everything else. I was in a wedding a month ago and I was legit hangry by the time dinner was served. So although it\u2019s an easy oversight, it can easily ruin the mood for the entire wedding party. \n\nThat\u2019s her only transgression here. \n\nShow up at 7, get ready and shut up if you\u2019re not gonna be supportive. \n\nIt\u2019s beyond me why she would ask you to be a maid when you live out of state in the first place, but I\u2019d bet my life that she\u2019ll regret asking you if you open your mouth to complain.

It\u2019s not unreasonable.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nBeing in a bridal party these days is a whole lot of hassle, both financially and generally. Maybe your bride is typical and maybe she's a little much, but either way I think you had a basic idea of what you were getting in for when you agreed.\n\nShow up, take whatever non-prime spot they assign you, bring a protein shake or something light to eat, and hope for the best with your hair and makeup.

Hair and makeup takes at least an hour and a half per person. Longer for the bride, who usually goes toward the end. The finish time is not the ceremony time. People still need to get dressed, first looks are often a thing, and pictures are often several hours before the ceremony. \n\nThis was not planned to screw you over.

Usually makeup artists come with one other person and they can have you glam in 20-30 minutes tops. I only skimmed the story but the start time is too early imo.", "Ima be real with you. The average person can spend an entire day being a part of a wedding party without needing a nap or regular meals. Sucks that you got medical issues that cause that for you, but people tolerate some minor inconveniences for themselves to be a part of an important event and be there for someone on their special day. It's pretty normal to need to be somewhere early just to get ready and be part of the whole day if you're involved in a wedding, and it's not terror and insanity. That's pretty dramatic.", "Seriously. The bride's main focus that day should be getting married, not ensuring grown women get three square meals that fit everyone's dietary needs. Luckily we live in a time where if you're hungry, you can get food brought right to you, and with more options than pizza or Chinese food like it was pre-smartphones.", "Especially since she's done literally nothing else with the wedding party until this point due to distance.", "This.  OP could just show up and be helpful on a day when the bride/groom/family are already incredibly stressed with a billion things on their plate.  Or OP can continue to make it all about her and her inconvenience and the bride should arrange lunch etc.  OP seems convinced she's on the right.  She's really just being selfish, inconsiderate, and making the whole thing about her.", "You think the bride is going to have to \u201cinteract/entertain\u201d people? There\u2019s nothing wrong with her bringing a book, all that time would make me insane also. She does need to not bring this up to the bride and maybe since she skipped everything bring a tray of crudite and some other light not messy snack and drinks.", "Probably doesn't meet her strict IVF diet", "I did this for my wedding! I ordered breakfast ahead of time for everyone to eat whenever. We weren\u2019t sure how hungry we would be by lunch, so we waited until the day of to DoorDash.", "Yes, most people can do that - but why on earth is something like that even required? Why would a bride want exhausted and hangry guests? Or, even worse - drunk?\n\nSure, if need be, I can help someone out for that long but why on earth would getting married require this level of inconvenience? I literally do not understand the reason. People are perfectly capable of dressing themselves in the comfort of their own homes. Having been a bride - why would any bride want to hang around a whole bunch of bored people for nine hours before her wedding? Just - why?", "Personally, I wouldn't want to ask people who are already helping me to go without \"regular meals\" in the first place. Food is also important for energy, which is usually very helpful for big events.\n\n\n\nTo each their own, I suppose.\n\n\n\nEdited to add: I don't think it should have to be a catered lunch or anything, but people should be able to at least order something on their own if they're hungry, imo", "I wish I had an award for this comment. This is how the real world works. Most adults are fully capable of hanging out in an air bnb for 9 hours, figure out how to feed themselves in said airbnb before they even arrive to the location, and still attend a party that night. Hell lots of adults can go to work for 9 hours, acquire food without even having the amenity of a kitchen like an airbnb has, and still go to a party that night. Lots of adults call that Friday and it happens every week.", "You literally can\u2019t be the center of attention for a whole 24 hours? Can\u2019t give your friend one whole day with the focus on what they want and not you?", "So sounds like given you weren't able to attend all of the other events, and the fact that you can't drink is solely on you and not on anyone else to keep track of, you should be fine spending one day hanging out with the bride for her wedding.\n\nIs she already accepted that you weren't going to be at all the other events, and I'm guessing didn't make a fuss, So why can't you spend one day, one single day doing something for her without making of us? If you are that concerned about your makeup, then find something else to eat that won't mess up the makeup. Or, ask if you can apply the lipstick yourself after you've already eaten. Don't drink, once again that is 100% on you. Keep yourself distracted on your phone, make sure you bring a charger. Bring a book, bring up crossword or something to do.\n\nUltimately, she is asking you for one day, one day where you don't complain and you just do the job of a bridesmaid. If you can't do that, then you should have turned her down from the beginning.", "Many moons ago, I was a bridesmaid for my bff in the Bay Area in the summer, outside wedding. Her parents had a restaurant and were prepping the food. Her mom asked for my help prepping so I was there until 4a. Hair and makeup time was stupid early, but I took a nap and showed. Whatever they used to set it, our hair and make up didn\u2019t budge even in the heat. We drank and giggled and enjoyed. I could\u2019ve chosen to be cranky but I didn\u2019t because it was all about her, so I took pleasure in supporting wherever I could. Nothing wrong with taking the lead in offering to coordinate food, drinks, whatever. Why not just ask her, how can I help support you to take the load off? Make sure SHE is taken care of. It\u2019s one day. You can choose to be supportive and keep it light or you can be rude. Keep your needs organized, but do not vocalize to make any part of the day about your needs. She wants you there and you agreed. Leave all your stuff out of conversation for the day. Ask her: Are you hungry, are you thirsty, there\u2019s lipstick on your teeth, etc\u2026?!?! If she\u2019s already dealing with bossy in laws, she\u2019s really going to need the day as light as possible. YTA if you make the day about you.", "Because they want to spend their wedding day with their friends. If you get invited to spend the whole day with someone on their wedding, you just enjoy it. Hang out, socialize, do whatever. They're not going to be exhausted and hangry. It's 8am they can show up. And adults are more than capable of getting their own food lol", "In situations like this, it's never just, oh we're not gonna eat for 8 hours, they'll figure something out. You can bring yourself snacks. They'll eventually get hungry around lunch time and someone will figure something out. Idk, She said to be there around 8am on the day of a wedding, which I don't think is unreasonable. I think a big thing here in the difference is that I'm not going to grill one of my friends about what exactly is going on the day of their wedding. Im gonna show up, be there, and if I get hungry, I'll get myself some damn food lol", "I assume in laws are helping pay for the wedding, honestly."]}
