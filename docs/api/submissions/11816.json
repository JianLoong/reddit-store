We definitely fight but it is infrequent. I always tried to be the best brother I can, often paying for meals, trying my best to wake my brother up for school, keeping the apartment organized and always offering my assistance to him for schoolwork. Despite all this, I feel that get no respect from him and I think he likes to take advantage of the fact that I'm not Mom or Dad and don't have any \"official\" authority over him. He gets unreasonably mad and pissy when I ask him for favours that even slightly inconvenience him like putting his shoes away, cleaning his mess in the kitchen, or sending me photos. Any time we go out to eat, it's always what he wants to eat and what he wants to do after. He lies to me all the time about touching and taking my stuff. Even just asking questions and making conversation he responds in a really snarky and needlessly aggressive tone. It has been getting on my nerves so I do end up yelling at him because I am so sick of his behaviour. What is worse is that when he does talk to our parents, he always goes on about how terrible of a brother I am, calling me unsupportive and abusive because I yell at him, that I never help him with anything and am always \"forcing\" him to do things he doesn't want to do (referring to favours and chores I politely ask of him). This then leads to my parents yelling at me for being a bad brother. I have expressed my opinions and concerns, emphasizing everything I do for him but they just brush it off saying that I'm the oldest and it's my duty to do all this. I have tried talking to him about it but I get a half-assed apology and the behaviour continues. This past month I decided I was done with the disrespect and decided to actually be a bad brother. I was hoping that by showing him this, he would be more appreciative of everything I did do for him and would stop treating me like garbage. I have been making him pay me back for everything we eat and buy from now on to the penny, I now yell and demand favours and chores to be done instead of asking, I don't bother waking him up in the morning so he is late for school almost all the time now etc. I have noticed that he has somewhat curbed his behaviour and has not been so defiant but it is definitely due to fear rather than respect. I know I am the older sibling but my brother also isn't a small child. I feel like I have given a lot to him and have not received anything but punishment and spite in return. I am not proud of what I am doing but I also don't have any other ideas.

I agree with another commenter who said to treat him like a roommate. You're only two years older, it's not appropriate for you to be asked to parent him. Just be a good roommate- do your half of the chores, pay for just your own food, and don't be responsible for waking him up. Also don't yell at him. Roommates just basically do their own thing, unless there's something they need to communicate about like \"I have work in the morning could you please keep it down\" or they want to hang out over dinner or something", "NTA.

But I am clouded by personal experience. My parents were out of the house a lot as well. But they HAD to be, otherwise there wouldn't be food and electricity. They worked 5 jobs between them to keep the house running. So while I see where some of the commenters are coming from, it's hard for me to make a call without more information \n\nI will say, your brother sounds spoiled as hell, and that's definitely on them. Even when not physically there, you have to be a parent", "Everyone sucks. The duty lies with your parents. They need to step up and take care of him. His resentment is probably towards them, but he takes it out on you because you're the one who's actually there.", "This is a new situation though I should have clarified. Our parents got new jobs in September so this has been an adjustment over the past few months. Maybe thats causing the resentment idk though.", "I think you mean 16 and not 26?", "I\u2019m the oldest of 6 children and while my parents were home (dad disabled after an injury and mom sahm) we were ignored and emotionally abused. I experienced what it did to me and my siblings and the behaviour your brother is showing -in my mind- could be acting out due to difficulty adjusting to the new situation. Maybe now you\u2019ve shown him what an actual \u201cbad brother\u201d is, you could try and talk to him. He might not feel able to talk to your parents out of fear or he doesn\u2019t know the right words to say.
