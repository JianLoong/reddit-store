{"id": 6027, "submission_id": "zz2wlv", "title": "AITA for reporting my neighbor to CPS?", "selftext": "My neighbor has two kids, a toddler around 3ish and a baby that\u2019s less than a year. She\u2019s unemployed and has a roommate, but neither of them pay any attention to the toddler. Here\u2019s why I contacted CPS\u2026I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s a developmental issue with the child and that he\u2019s nonverbal. He will scream and cry all day (this is in an apartment building so it\u2019s really easy to hear), throw himself against the wall and door, attempt to hit the baby (caught someone telling him not to do that), and generally just be neglected. Mom took the baby outside when it was nicer weather. I have never once seen the toddler outside of the apartment. She has \u201cvisitors\u201d that come and go on occasion and I\u2019m not sure of the relationship, but she has also left the toddler and the baby home alone for extended periods of time. CPS did come and check things out and shortly thereafter grandma started coming to spend time with him and things were better. Well, grandma hasn\u2019t been around much for the past few months except to stop by and say hi and the behavior has started again. Between the toddler screaming, crying, and throwing himself into things, and the baby crying more often than not I\u2019m considering contacting CPS again. However, some friends advised me that I was out of line for doing that and should have taken different steps. So, AITA?\n\n\nEdit: I just want to thank everyone who has said that I\u2019m  not the AH here. I\u2019m not around 24/7, but hearing the crying and screaming go on for so long breaks my heart. For those wondering what my friends would have preferred I do instead of contacting CPS, it was suggested that I offer to watch her kids when I\u2019m available or that I help her find some type of service to assist her with her son. I\u2019m a full time student with a job on the side. I did what I felt was best, but if anyone has any other suggestions I\u2019m listening. Thank you all again!\n\nEdit #2: For those of you who think I\u2019m being nosy or that I should stay out of it I should also mention that I\u2019m a paramedic and have been for 11 years. We\u2019re legally required to report cases of child neglect while on duty. Since I\u2019m not on duty when this is happening I\u2019m simply making the call as a concerned citizen, not a paramedic in which case they tend to move quicker and there would also be documentation by either myself or my partner, and possibly hospital staff if the child was transported and treated for something. I also don\u2019t work the squads in the same area that I live anymore.", "created_utc": 1672413324, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz2wlv/aita_for_reporting_my_neighbor_to_cps/", "score": 297, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am entering my last semester of grad school where I am studying social work. I get it, everyone hates CPS. It is not where I envision myself working in the future. There are valid criticisms, obviously, but CPS is the agency you are supposed to contact when you suspect abuse.

No matter what you do you will feel bad. I think many people would be shocked to find out how bad abuse has to be to remove children from parents. In most cases the are not removed from home or may go with a family members for short time. CPS doesn\u2019t have enough foster homes to place the kids removed for extreme physical/sexual abuse & dangerous neglect.\nI knew a younger mom who was driving drunk with both her kids in car. The baby was in a car seat but 3 years old was not in seatbelt. There is an accident & the 3 year old is thrown out of car & dies. They still allowed this lady to keep her kid! Maybe for a year the kids were in a family member\u2019s custody. She must have been charged with something but I don\u2019t believe it was jail time. I think it was house arrest, lose license, fines & monitored probation. They would come out occasionally to inspect the home but it was alway scheduled so there was time to clean up disaster of house & not drink.  At a certain times each day she would have to blow in this thing that recorded if there was alcohol in her system. It was a joke- she has an assigned time to do it so there were no surprise tests & someone else could blow it for you. After killing my child because I was drink I would want to stop drinking but she didn\u2019t. She would start drinking right after the evening blow test. She had this big credenza set up like a shrine for the child who died- pictures & other stuff. I would be so embarrassed to put that up knowing that i was responsible for her death. Had she stopped drinking & taking her life more seriously I could understand but it\u2019s tacky to put a shrine up to show how much you loved your child when your behaviors have not changed. The father of the last 2 kids was shot & killed by the police when she was pregnant. He was walking all over an urban neighborhood carrying a rifle on shoulder strap (only concealed, licensed guns are legal here).He was going thru some kind of mental break then so he did not follow the police instructions & was shot.

You should report every time you see it, maybe she will get the help she actually needs and more importantly maybe the child will get the some help.. \n\nAnd no you should not help with the child INSTEAD of reporting the mom.. You should help the child (if you can) because you know it\u2019s hurting.

If this child is delayed they could be crying because that\u2019s what they do. Obviously cps didn\u2019t feel like the kids should be removed so why call again. Because they\u2019re so nosey they worry when they can\u2019t hear an adults voice over the crying child? And because the mothers car is gone when the kids cry they think they\u2019re left alone. My cars are gone at times when I\u2019m home. They\u2019re just being extra nosey and wasting resources when cps has already investigated.
