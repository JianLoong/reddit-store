My nephews are Franklyn (13m) and Issac (11m). I am currently watching them, they came over a few days before Christmas. My siblings, my parents and I spend Christmas at my house. My sister and her husband were there for Christmas but have since left for a cruise. \n\nI am a history teacher and I like getting history antiques to display in my classroom or for my prize box at school, I also am a vendor at my best friends (31m) antique store. Because of this, I often go to yard sales, estate sales, ect.\n\nI saw a sign for a \u201cyard sale\u201d while driving the boys to lunch, I decided to stop and check it out. The house was massive and there were piles of stuff out, including a lot of sports stuff. I was talking to the people running it, and they said that their dad had died and they just wanted to get rid of the non-sentimental stuff. The prices were extremely cheap, and they said they wanted to just get rid of it, and judging from the house and clothes, are clearly very well off, so it made sense. \n\nFranklyn plays baseball and loves anything sports related, he ended up getting many boxes of sports memorabilia, which I paid for him. Franklyn is a very kind boy, even if a bit rowdy, ever since I bought him the stuff he\u2019s been thanking me. We have a sports history expert we work with and he authenticated everything. \n\nI told Isaac that I would take him on a shopping spree to the local video game/comic book stores, he\u2019s very nerdy and likes that kind of stuff. \n\nYesterday, I was on my phone drinking tea when I got a text from Franklyn, it was a video with text about his \u201cgoofy ahh\u201d brother, he accidentally texted this to me, I thought this was odd but when I opened the video, I saw why he was calling Issac goofy. Issac was saying some insanely sexist stuff about how girls in his class are \u201cstupid\u201d and how girls are \u201cworse at school and everything\u201d then boys. Franklyn told me he tried to talk to Isaac but when he wouldn\u2019t stop, he started recording. Franklyn has a girlfriend, and he told me that he was disgusted by Issacs words and then went on to me about how amazing she is. Franklyn said he didn\u2019t know where Isaac learned this, especially since he\u2019s still in elementary school (6th grade). \n\nI tried talking to Issac and he kept saying sexist things and talking about women like they were dumb and objects. I told him he needed to apologize and when he refused, I told him he wouldn\u2019t get his trip to the store until he reflected on why what he said was wrong, and apologize for laughing in my face.\n\nWhen my younger sister (28f) found out about this, she said I was wrong for trying to \u201cparent them\u201d and that Issac is \u201cnot my kid\u201d and I should consider how he feels, especially because Franklyn \u201cmocked\u201d him. My teacher friends (both male and female) have agreed with me though, and said I should have his mom contact the teacher about how he treats girls in his class.

Mother of nephew needs to get her shit together.", "NTA, but I think this is a bit tougher than people are acting like and is boarding on ESH. Yes, Isaac's behavior is concerning and needs to be addressed. Franklyn's instinct to record his brother and then forward it to adults, though - that's also concerning and should be addressed. Are you the right person to address it? I think it's acceptable to tell Isaac your concerns and how hurtful it is. Holding the video game trip over his head for it? I think that was perfectly within your rights and not assholish, *but will it actually affect his opinion?* Interrupting sexist beliefs in people, even young people, is really hard because so much of culture enforces it. Most politicians are men, so therefore men must be best at it. Most famous scientists (you hear about), so therefore men are the best at it. Most of the students in the comp-sci class are boys, therefore boys are best at it. I'm no expert, but I think a better way to affect his opinion than demanding an apology (since he won't even listen at this point and thinks he's right), as much as you can as the aunt, would be to withdraw the requirement of an apology and replace it with a simple \"earnest conversation\" requirement. If he refuses to even do that, no trip.\n\nIt sounds like Isaac might think girls are \"stupid\" because he thinks the girls *in his class* are stupid. He also probably doesn't quite get why what he's saying is so offensive and wrong. Talk to him about times *you* faced sexism. Present him with the achievements of women, especially in male-dominated fields (but don't neglect achievements in female-dominated fields, like Florence Nightingale, since you don't want to emphasize that \"male\" fields are more important or better). And question him about why he thinks the girls in his class are stupid and objects. But again, you won't be able to have that conversation until he's willing. And withholding the trip for video games is fine.", "NTA.\n\nThe easy answer is to tell Isaac that you're just a female and too stupid to figure out where the comic book store is.\n\nSome kid at his school turned him on to Andrew Tate and similar wastes of carbon.  You might want to let him know that he thinks he's a big deal edgelord, but he's becoming just another \"Little Tator Tot\" and those that keep going down that rabbit hole end up loners complaining that nobody appreciates their manly man edginess.  This really is a big deal because Little Tator Tots can become full-on incels and there are plenty of White Supremacist groups actively recruiting incels.  Once they get on the hate train, it's easy to ride it all the way down the line.", "NTA I\u2019m glad you stepped in. His words and thoughts are disgusting and should be called out every single time he utters them", "NTA  Your sister left her kids with you while she went on a cruise and you weren't supposed to \"parent\" them?!  Issacs feelings do not matter when he is being a misogynist AH.  I would call the teacher myself is sister doesn't.", "So clearly NTA why the fuck is this so split?! Their mom left you in charge of parenting and it sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job of it. Your sister needs to butt out it\u2019s literally none of her business.", "NTA. If I had a sibling I would\u2019ve wanted them to react that way with my kids and help teach a lesson. It takes a village, and you were trying to make sure your nephew was aware of his mistakes so he could learn and be a better person.", "NTA.\n\nYour house, your rules.\n\nIf your sister doesn't want you to parent them, they shouldn't be dumped  on you when going on a cruise.\n\nI'd even go so far as to tell him you've changed your mind and aren't going to reward bad behaviour with gifts.\n\nHe got mocked for being awful. And quite rightly so.\n\nActions have consequences. 'Bout time he learned that.", "NTA. They need to stop allowing an 11 year old onto youtube. This sounds like he's been watching videos made by Andrew Tate and his ilk who all prey on boys who are self conscious and fill them with nonsense about both men and women. Nasty stuff. He needs help because he's clearly already gone down that rabbit hole. Sad to read.", "Different sister, my younger sister is defending this, my older sis (their mom) doesn\u2019t have service/WiFi right now because of cruise", "Man I hope you have the top comment so the official reasoning for the judgement is \"I can't fucking read\"", "I said my sister and her husband are on a cruise, her husband is their biological dad, the only person my sister has ever dated. Their dad is an absolute sweetheart, I haven\u2019t been able to contact them due to cruise, but I don\u2019t think dad would be pleased with this behavior. His dad is a very progressive man, has encouraged my other siblings sins (so his nephews) to  wear makeup if they want. He has always been respectful of women from what I\u2019ve seen, they don\u2019t monitor the kids social medias, so I\u2019m assuming it my be from that.", "Exactly this! The parents left the kids with her for the week - how can she not \u201cparent\u201d them? They clearly trust her judgment and she\u2019s been an awesome aunt to these boys.

Also, OP said parents are out of contact range on their cruise. If the children were put in OP's care, then she is trusted enough by their parents to be the \"parent\" in this situation.", "OP made a promise. She needs to stick by what she said she would do. Kids will constantly test their boundaries and they need to know a parent figure is strong and dependable. \n\nThat being said, YES, a discussion needs to take place with the sexiest-spewing child. But that\u2019s a separate issue from fulfilling a promise.", "It would probably be held until he had apologized. I love him but I wouldn\u2019t tolerate this, I have given him punishments a few times while watching him for being too rowdy, but nothing morally wrong, just for doing stupid stuff teenagers do.", "OP isn\u2019t \u201cbacking out,\u201d she gave him an opportunity to get his presents when he reflects on his behaviour. \n\nAlso, who would buy a kid a gift that DOES objectify women or have sexist themes? If a kid even asked for something like that we\u2019d be having a long talk about why it\u2019s not acceptable.", "Oh, good. I guess. Now onward, to figure out what's wrong with your nephew and younger sister. Two for the price of one!", "Lol I even took away my \u201cupvote\u201d due my to dumbassery", "Shit that\u2019s my bad. Disregard my comment about that. \n\nSince that\u2019s out of the question, you know exactly where it\u2019s coming from..you work there.\n\nBut you still are NTA. You stood up to an invisible victim.", "Oh!! Well then she has even LESS to say! Especially if she doesn\u2019t have kids of her own! (Gods I hope she doesn\u2019t have kids of her own to teach these horrible lessons to \ud83d\ude48) The parents left you in charge of their kids and not her for a reason lol", "Not how decent parenting works. The kid repeatedly said shitty things and refused to apologize. He now faces consequences for his behavior. That\u2019s how that works", "Saying 'I will take you somewhere' is not the same as 'I promise I will take you somewhere', & you can't force it into being the same. OP did not promise anyone anything.", "Barbie dolls are an example of a common toy that people buy without thinking. She represents a standard of the female body that isn\u2019t realistic.", "So you work for your \n1. Holiday gifts\n2. B day gifts\n3. Mother\u2019s Day gifts/ Father\u2019s Day gift. \nGifts are giving no strings attached. If they have strings they are favors and in that case that is favoritism and if I was op sis best bet you wouldn\u2019t see either kid", "She\u2019s not making him work, she\u2019s making him recognise why what he said is offensive and wrong, and using the gifts as a learning point. \n\nNormally I\u2019d agree with the \u201cgifts are given no strings attached\u201d but this is the beginning of incel behaviour, it\u2019s dangerous and it needs to be stopped, and this is how OP is dealing with it.", "If your mother or father abused you, would you say, \"Oh, well.  I promised them presents so I'll go buy some and wrap them up despite my broken arm.\" ?  If one of your friends told you that you were inferior because of your genetic makeup, would you get them a birthday present any way?  \n\nOP can't stop being an aunt to her nephew but she can definitely refuse to reward terrible behavior.  He insulted her when she confronted him about how he's been talking about girls and women.\n\nBad behavior requires punishment otherwise the bad behavior will continue and, perhaps, even worsen.  Refusing to take someone to a comic book store is well within bounds for punishment."]}
