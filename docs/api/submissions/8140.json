Then you seemingly made no effort to even try to know her or be in her life. We don\u2019t know how difficult or easy this is for her but moving into a new place suddenly with less privacy can be a lot for anyone to handle, let alone a young child. Your attempt at talking to her was poking at her with a question you already know the answer to.

Something tells me for his reaction, this is reminiscent of his history with you. \n\nAsking her how old she is while you already knew the answer seems like a very half assed attempt to get to know her.

Yeah  \nBut y'all are acting like she's a horrible grandmother.", "YTA\n\nYou demanded an interaction.

You patronized her.\n\nShe lost her home and had to move in with you, a woman who probably hates her because in her mind everyone else Grandparents are a part of their lives so you must hate her. Now to demonstrate that you fit perception you force a conversation and sent her to room when she didn't act as you wanted her to with your patronizing questions. You lack some serious self-awareness and general awareness. Your ability to have empathy is non-existent.\n\nShe is probably frightened out of her mind and you took away food because she didn't pat your butt and soothe your ego.\n\nYou never expressed a boundary or request to stop rolling her eyes. You punished her without giving her a chance to correct herself.\n\nYou patronized and belittled her Father who was rightly furious at your actions. You had no right act that way to either of them.\n\nOverall you're pretty cookie cut from your generation.

The 3 youngest still live with me as they are all either in highschool or college.\n\nWhen my oldest was 18 he had a child with his girlfriend. His girlfriend wanted to give her up for adoption but my son convinced her not to do it and let him raise the child instead. I told him I have enough kids already, I'm not raising another one because really, who is  gonna end up taking care of the child when he is going to college? I told him to either let his girlfriend give up the baby or move out of my home because I'm not going to help him, at all. I have enough kids already. He chose to keep the baby and move out.\n\nI didn't hear from him for years after that but he kept in touch with the rest of my children and they told me he s very upset.\n\nA few days ago my youngest son came and wanted to talk to me. He said that my oldest is going through a hard time and needs a place to stay and asked if he can invite him to stay with us for some time. I decided to let him stay with us as he seemed to be out of options.\n\nThey moved in with us 2 days ago and my son and I have been talking and trying to fix things. However I'm very bothered by his daughter's behaviour. yesterday she was sitting in the living room and playing with her phone. I tried to start a conversation with her by asking her how old she is. I already know how old she is obviously I was just trying to talk to her. She didn't answer. I asked again, no answer. after the 3rd time my daughter took out the kids airpods and told her I'm talking to her. I repeated my question and she rolled her eyes and said I could have asked someone else because everyone here knows her age. \n\nI told her I was trying to talk to her and she said I know was trying not to. I told her this is no way to talk to your grandmother and she rolled her eyes again. This is when I decided I've had enough. I told her to go to her room and not to get out until she apologizes. She decided not to apologize and missed dinner.\n\nWhen my son came home he went to his room and then angrily came back and asked us why his daughter was not given anything to eat. I told him the story but he kept yelling at me saying I had no right to punish his child like that. He kept calling me an asshole and other names. I tried to calm him down but he wouldn't stop yelling and said they'll move out in the morning. I think he was overreacting but all my children are on his side so I wonder if I was the asshole is this situation\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A close relationship is formed at birth and you gave that up when you refused to help your son.  That\u2019s why he was angry with you.  You chose to be selfish instead of helping.

It's understandable that you might have feelings of resentment towards your son's decision to have a child while still living at home, but it's important to remember that his daughter is a separate person who did not make that decision. It's not clear from your message whether the granddaughter was being disrespectful or if it was just a communication issue or even maybe she has heard about you kicking her father out when she was born and may have some dislike towards you from it. However, it's not right to withhold meals as punishment for a child or teenager. It's important to address the behavior and find a solution together instead of resorting to punishment. It's also important to keep in mind that the relationship between a parent and a grandparent is a different dynamic from the relationship between a parent and their own child, and that different expectations and boundaries may apply. Your son is upset because he feels you are punishing his child without consulting him first after playing no role in her life and he was just expressing his feelings. It might be helpful to have a conversation with him, your other children and your granddaughter to understand everyone's perspective, and to try to find a way to move forward that works for everyone. It also is a bit early to be pushing \"This is no way to talk to your grandmother\", this is the first time she's ever met you, and if she's aware that you kicked her dad out because of her being born unfortunately you may have lost her respect, expecting her to be kind to you, the first time you meet, after you did that to her family, is a bit far fetched.

No child should ever be rude like that under any circumstance.\n\nIf others are going to be rude to you (like, say, asking an insulting question that could be seen as betraying exactly how little they know or care about you), you're not obligated to be polite. \n\n>This is why we see the current generation offended by everything and traumatized by everything. \n\nAs opposed to you, someone who's wildly offended on behalf of a complete stranger because the grandkid they made no effort to get to know for nine years didn't answer a stupid question about her age.", "You kicked out your 18 year old son who just a child, when he needed support. He had every right to cut contact with you. He's with you right now so his daughter has a roof over her head. It was an all or nothing deal with this situation, and you chose nothing. You don't get to punish her, because you are no one to this girl. All she knows about you is that you kicked her dad out when she was born.", "Because you gave the ultimatum - \"me or this kid\". He chose his child.", "The thing is this isn't a random stranger. A stranger starts out on neutral. This is a person who, to a nine year olds understanding, is the grandmother who didn't want her for 9 years. Thats a horrendously bad first impression. \n\nAnd maybe the OP's son reacted like that BECAUSE he knows how his mother operates and he isn't comfortable with his child being raised like that.", "If this kid knew OP, had spent copious amounts of time with them and behaved like this, I'd say sure -- kiddo is being a bit rude. \n\nBut by OP's own admission, the kid was doing her own thing *and* had headphones in. Kiddo just lost her home and is a guest in a house with people she doesn't know well and her dad was gone. It makes complete sense that she was wary and standoffish. \n\nAnd the son didn't overreact. He's the parent therefore he gets to dole out the punishment. OP could have said to the kid \"I expect an apology and I'll be speaking with your father when he gets back\". It was simple as that. \n\nWe all need to bear in mind, this kid moved in 2 days ago.", "In both directions. OP isn't extending respect either.", "Oh ffs a child isn't going to die if they miss a meal. \n\nThat's how punishments used to be given before everyone decided to psychoanalyse everything. \n\nBad? You're going to bed without dinner.\n\nIf Grandma is babysitting than Grandma is in charge.", "They sure as hell do when that elder is housing and feeding you. \n\n Its pretty damn clear she does considering she posted this on Reddit wanting opinions. If she didn't care she wouldnt have posted.\n\nYou saying OP doesn't care shows how ignorant and immature you are.", "I can't read this nonsense. Proper grammar and punctuation..... look into it.", "\ud83d\ude06. \n\nEmpathy and situational awareness. Stop trying to armchair diagnose my response.\n\nDad should have taught the child to mind their manners in any situation no matter how uncomfortable they are. \n\nPeople need to stop coddling their children. \n\nGrandma's house, Grandma's rules. Don't like it? Leave.", "Everybody makes everything out to be trauma nowadays. It's fucking ridiculous.", "You're the one who's clearly offended \ud83d\ude44.  Not I.", "An 18 year old is not a child. She didn't kick out her 18 year old, just said that she's not capable of looking after an extra kid. Her son made his own choice.", ">And maybe the OP's son reacted like that BECAUSE he knows how his mother operates and he isn't comfortable with his child being raised like that.\n\nThen he should have either not brought her there, or informed op ya and nays", "BUT HOW OLD IS CHILD?!", "children also used to be beat, wanna advocate for that as well? wanna know why as humans we decided to stop these abusive punishments? because we realised they were abusive. fucking hell never have children please", "\"grandma\" is a TOTAL stranger for the kid, every kid knows to don't give confidence to strangers and OP is not part of her family.\r  \nAlso, OP said that she is not like this to her uncles and aunt, so is obvious that she is not 100% the problem. OP can't act like a grandma when she was NEVER in the kid life.\r  \nThe kid was probably under the care of her aunt (read carefully she was there) since she knows her aunt and not the rude stranger that call herself her grandma.", "Homie that\u2019s literally abuse and neglect. You\u2019re WITHHOLDING a necessity to SURVIVE. One meal here turns into a day of no meals and then multiple days.", "No she doesn\u2019t care. And that\u2019s clear. If she cared she wouldn\u2019t be just now meeting her granddaughter who is nine years old. She wouldn\u2019t be abusing her granddaughter. \n\nThe way she writes clearly shows she doesn\u2019t give af about her son or granddaughter.", "It\u2019s the internet you expect people to have grammar haha\u2026..NO", "It\u2019s incredibly bad manners to interrupt someone who has headphones on. Nobody owes you a conversation, that\u2019s incredibly entitled. Maybe she was overwhelmed, like most kids would be, and just wanted time to herself. \n\nOP YTA and so are you. Kids aren\u2019t property.", ">Grandma's house, Grandma's rules. Don't like it? Leave.\n\nCause a 9 year old can just leave, sure. \n\n>People need to stop coddling their children.\n\nBy the same logic people need to stop being so offended that a 9 year old didn't want to chat with a veritable stranger.", "\"I know you are, but what am I.\" A classic. I can see why your wife makes the rules. You're clearly still in Pre-K.", "Were you as an 18 year old ready to do what OP's son did and be an adult yourself?", "9, OP answered that in another comment.", "What the hell are you going on about? No one said anything about physical abuse.\n\nThe adults are having a conversation. Go back to bed.", "OP can act how she wants because  it's her home. Son, sons wife and granddaughter are using OP for food and shelter. They aren't their to bond. \n\nSo they all better show some gratitude.", "No. It is literally not abuse.\n\nWithholding one meal ....... the world isn't going to end for that kid.", "This is the stupidest post on this thread. it honestly is.\n\nYou're the type that would outright lie to the cops about someone abusing you.", "Lol no it's not. \n\nWearing headphones isn't a signal to say \"leave me alone\". Especially if you're a child.\n\nAnd yes,  if Grandma speaks to you, you pay attention and respond. Especially when she's the one taking on parental responsibilities like food and shelter.", "Now you're getting mad because you won't discuss the topic at hand anymore. Lol.", "Thnk you", "\"That's how punishments used to be given...\" I am continuing this. If you advocate for one of the punishments that used to be, then at least be aware of the contemporary punishments, which included beating.", "You seriously can't read or understand what people write, i feel really sorry for you", "What the fuck are you on about?", "Wearing headphones absolutely is a symbol to leave me alone or at the very least, accept i might be needing my own space so should only be interrupted if absolutely necessary, not for a useless question she **already knows the answer to**. \n\nShe\u2019s only her grandma by blood. She\u2019s done nothing for her before this, there\u2019s no relationship there, because of OP\u2019s choice to kick the dad out. Ergo there is absolutely zero respect required. Especially not for, again, a stupid question she already knows the answer to."]}
