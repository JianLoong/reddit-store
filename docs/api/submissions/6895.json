For larger pets, I'll cover them in the grave with an old cotton towel. \n\nI live in New England, and there are plenty of stones in the ground. I usually dig down at least 3 feet, and during that I'll pull out _a lot_ of rocks. Once I've buried the pet with dirt, I use the stones I dug out to make a cairn over the grave, and then search around for an appropriately sized and shaped rock for a headstone.\n\nOf the dozen pets I've buried like this, none of their graves have ever been disturbed by wildlife.", "This", "The body won\u2019t make anyone sick  directly where it is. However, it could contaminate water. If it\u2019s not buried deep enough, it can contaminate runoff, and if it\u2019s near groundwater or close to a body of water, it could contaminate them. If OP followed local rules (which it seems they didn\u2019t because they didn\u2019t know about them in other comments), there\u2019s no risk.

Since about the 1950s, they buried every pet in the back yard.  They got almost all of them proper engraved headstones that were flat on the ground.  \n\nThe last animal buried there was buried in the late 80s, maybe early 90s.  The stones have all long been overgrown.  \n\nThe house was sold after her death, and I seriously wondered if we should warn the new owners that they might find some interesting things if they ever need to dig the yard up.
