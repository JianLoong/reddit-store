My coworker doesn't usually have a lunch, we both typically snack on what's there. She also brings me food/snacks frequently so I thought I'd repay the favor.\n\nWhile we were eating, my manager (40f) came up front to go to lunch, as she typically does, which is part of the reason I didn't ask her. She looked shocked to see us eating Subway, and asked if we had thought to ask her if she wanted any.\n\nI let her know that I wouldn't be able to afford to pay for more than 2 lunches. She said she would have paid. I asked if she wanted to send me some money, and I could order something for her now, and she said it was too late.\n\nI don't do well with confrontation, so I just said sorry, and she continued to tell me she had ordered me coffee once and it spilled in her expensive brand new car.\n\nI thought this was weird to mention because I wasn't there in the car when it spilled. And that same day, when she came in with coffee for everyone but me and let me know mine had spilled, I told her she didn't need to go back to reorder mine but she did anyways. That was kind of her, but I feel like mentioning things you've done for people in the past during a confrontation is kinda manipulative.\n\nAnyways, she also said that our generation was just 'raised different' and claimed she was just joking and has been in a bad mood due to frustrating circumstances with our establishment.\n\nI feel guilty and I'm worried I could get in trouble for this. Is it rude to not ask someone if they want lunch? And also - if I had planned to ask, I still wasn't sure whether or not she had plans for lunch.", "created_utc": 1700594221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180ovxf/aita_for_ordering_only_one_of_my_coworkers_lunch/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I dont know why people are so entitled", "As someone who made an effort to make sure anyone who wanted to order lunch had a chance to order, but regularly got left out of lunch orders made by others, I had a knee jerk reaction on this, but this person is your manager, who regularly leaves for lunch and I assume doesn't ask you and your coworkers if she can pick something up for you, so NTA. You may want to try to include her in the future, but your assumption she wouldn't care is valid.", "NTA but I get where your manager was coming from, she's just working off previous office codes of behaviour where everyone worked full-time together and not ordering stuff for everyone if you did was kind of frowned upon.\n\nI would try and include her next time just to be nice.\n\n> I feel guilty and I'm worried I could get in trouble for this.\n\nI don't think you will, I just think it is different expectations colliding.", "NTA, your coworker has repeatedly fed you snacks, and it was a nice gesture to buy her lunch to return the favor. You don't have the same relationship with your manager, and so she can't expect the same level of consideration for a single cup of coffee that she spilled in her car.", "Toxic manager, wow.  Way to make a mountain out of something.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and certainly can\u2019t get in trouble for it.\n\nShe\u2019s not going to think about this again unless she sees you ordered and didn\u2019t ask her if she wants anything so don\u2019t stress about it.\n\nJust make sure next time you\u2019re ordering anything, you ask for her order just to placate the situation and manage her mood swings (and the money for whatever she\u2019s ordering). \n\nNTA - it\u2019s lunch takeout.  Not a big deal and your assumption was based on her usual routine", "NTA but in the future if she wants to get you something then decline forever. Never let someone hold something over your head. This time it\u2019s a coffee. Next time who knows. You\u2019re not obligated to get her anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
