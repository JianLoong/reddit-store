That will inevitably lead to what ifs, which will then lead to regret & that will lead to resentment of your bf for holding you back from your dreams. That or you'll break up, feel dumb & resent yourself instead. Follow your dreams. If your relationship can't withstand something so positive that you've always wanted & what could arguably be considered the best thing that's ever happened in your professional life, then it's not the right relationship for you. Neither of you ATA. Life just happens. Good luck!", "NAH, this is a true conflict. It really sounds like you two are fundamentally incompatible. I'd say no one is right and no one is wrong, it's just you don't have the same goals or even ideas of what a fun day looks like. So, the only question is, do you have a deep love for each other that is worth the sacrifices that one or both of you will have to make to stay together", "YTA already. \n\nIt seems like you and your husband are fundamentally incompatible, but the thing that stands out to me is - you agreed that you didn't want to go abroad anymore, yet in this post, you talk about how you dream of an international career. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but you made your husband think you didn't want to do that anymore, and it is turning out to be a lie. \n\nYou need to understand that for him, you are going back on your previous agreement. He is hurt and upset because you've seen some shiny opportunity, and rather than abiding by your previous discussion of not moving abroad anymore, you expect him to sit down and rehash everything out. Even here, you're looking for justification for *why it's okay for you to break your previous agreement.* \n\nThat is what makes you the AH. Not you wanting something else, but you misleading him about something that makes you fundamentally incompatible.", "NAH, Maybe it worked for you the first 2 times you were long distance but clearly he wasnt happy. It sounds to me like you have 2 very different goals/visions of your future and should probably make sure those align at least somewhat closely before you guys end up having kids.", "Did you (a) just randomly get this job offer, or (b) did you apply for it (already knowing your husbands position on the matter) *then* get it?", "NAH multiple things can be true\n\n- for you - family is alway more important than job and money.  Putting family first is NOT a bad thing despite all the comments here saying \u2018you have to prioritize you\u2019.   Sometimes putting family first requires sacrifice.  \n\n- for your husband - sometimes you need to step outside your comfort zone to grow.  It can be scary, but supporting your spouse and growing is awesome.\n It is reasonable to go but have an agreement that if it is miserable that you will seek an early oppty to return.\n\nWhen I was young I did an internship on Wall Street in the US in high finance.  I was good at it and got a job offer.  I enjoyed the work and could have made tons of money early.  The problem was a married a country Texas girl who would have despised living in NYC.  She would have gone but I knew she would have hated it. \n\nI choose to not ask her to go and instead got a job where I travelled a good amount which I enjoyed but we got to live where she loved, had family, and was comfortable.  Now 20 years later we live in a nice country property and where I thought I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it I love the quiet life and culture here.  \n\n\n\nCommunication is key!  Good luck", "\"**We** discussed that **we** don't want a LDR anymore.\" Now **you** want a LDR \"against your husbands wishes\".\n\nIf both of you realized that a LDR is not good for your relationship, then this job opportunity should never have been considered in the first place.

His reaction seems a little extreme by not being willing to have a proper conversation with you (maybe he needs time to process?) but I think him being upset is understandable given that he doesn\u2019t want move countries (is it somewhere he doesn\u2019t know the language? Coz if so that\u2019d be very isolating for him) or disrupt his own career goals by doing so. Tie that in with the fact you both already agreed you wouldn\u2019t do long distance again \u2026 yeah I can see why he\u2019d be upset.

This isn't really an AITA.  You and your husband need to sit down and find a way to overcome this difference in lifestyle choices.

That\u2019s the thing - this offer is a positive thing for me and the reaction I get from him is only resentment, which is just sad. If he said I\u2019m very happy and proud, but xyz - then we can discuss logistics and decide whether it\u2019s doable or not. I\u2019d be more than happy for a discussion.

I thought he\u2019d at least congratulate me for getting such an amazing offer EVEN IF it\u2019s not doable. Then it\u2019d be all easier for me.

I can travel just for vacation with him, although he doesn\u2019t always get time off and tells me to go alone.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sth building up in him and needing a counselor to get to the bottom of it. He always knew how I am and what I want and it was OK. This year some shift happened.", "Thank you for your honesty. I just feel like there\u2019s not much room for compromise here. I understand that he wants to stay 100%. He doesn\u2019t want to do long distance either, so it\u2019s either his way or my way. I am currently sad that he didn\u2019t even congratulate me nor seemed proud in any way, just sees this as an inconvenience. Perhaps some time is needed for our emotions to cool down and we can sit down again and find a way.", "I don't understand the point honestly. It's six months. People act like it's the end times here.

She's going back on that and screwing her husband over on his career.", "They're pretty much in the exact same situation. She has a career opportunity while he's about to finish exams that will lead to a career opportunity.

So I think it\u2019s a question of me staying or going long distance for this time.", "I could come back even more often as the flights are inexpensive.", "WNBTA-I run global mobility programs for a living and here's what you need to ask for. It's a 6m assignment, right? Tell your company you need flights covered for either him to visit you or you to visit him 3x during the assignment. You and husband can cover the other two yourselves. Agree between the two of you that you'll have a 4 day weekend once a month, alternating who goes where. This is VERY common-most short term (less than 12m) assignments are unaccompanied because the spouse/partner has a job or other commitments that make it difficult for them to  go along for a relatively short period.\n\nMake sure your company provides you with furnished accommodation while you're there so you don't have double housing costs. If you need more help, message me.", "You job posting is temporary. 6 months is a length of time a lot of LTRs go through for the benefit of increased pay or further a career. I did 8 months abroad and at the end my BF joined me for a vacation before helping me move back home.\n\nI don't see why he has to move with you for 6 months? Can't you just do long distance in that time and then come back? Or decide later if he will move", "You agreed 3 yrs ago not to do it. Why wouldn't he be upset?", "I understand. I think sometimes, especially with some men, they feel threatened & emasculated when their gf or wife is the one who is or is perceived as being \"more successful\" than them. Idk if that's the case here obviously, but at the very least, he should be saying, \"I'm so happy for you. You deserve this. But...\"", "I think if he was excited for your promotion, you would still be upset. Maybe your post would be like \u201cmy husband was excited for me, but is now upset. I\u2019m getting mixed signals.\u201d  \n\nAlso, you thought if you went you would take the dog?!", "If you leave this marriage for the job youll think about this forever too. Did you marry your job or your marriage? Do you need this? Seems like selfish and a breach of a prior agreement to not do this again. If you want this life of international travel and independence so bad then why get married? Why lead someone on thinking that you wont do this? Will you regret this offer more than what potentially couldve happened in that lost time with your husband?", "NTA\n\nYou described yourself as more international/Cosmo and wanting to learn and travel. \n\nYou described him as a homebody and unwilling to learn or travel. \n\nWhile the relationship survived 2 prior stints of travel, do you think it can survive a lifetime of it? \n\nIt's a question worth asking. If you want to travel and see other places, have these opportunities and move abroad for work if offered etc.. then for your lifestyle goals, you just aren't compatible.\n\nWanting kids and a house are life goals, how you live your life is your lifestyle. If you can't live how you want, what's the point of any of it? You could have a house and kids and just feel trapped coz you're not doing it how you want to be doing it. \n\nYou could take this job and travel and it significantly increased your salary and so in turn you're in a better position to save for and buy a house(while having the lifestyle you want), that's better than feeling trapped or like a missed opportunity and living in a smaller house or taking longer to afford one. \n\nSometimes it's not what you do, it's how you do it. \n\nFor himself, if he doesn't want to move or learn, that's fine. But the consequences of that may be the relationship. If he wants a career at home and will be satisfied with that and you can't move him, accept it. If he wouldn't be happy, don't force him. \n\nIf you want the more cosmopolitan lifestyle and travel for work or exploring and experiencing cultures, do it, but it may cost you the relationship and you'll have to accept that too. If you wouldn't be happy staying, don't stay. \n\nBut if you do stay, it sounds like you'll be accepting a life without travel even for holidays, setting aside work. It'll obviously limit your career opportunities as that's what's given you the career growth you've had so far, including this opportunity. You could be stuck for a long time at current level, someone else will step up or be hired for the role and you'll be perceived as not as reliable(even if it's not said) or investable as an employee, that you are happy at the level you're at or will wait for something better to just come along(i.e. waiting for it to magically drop in your lap, which doesn't happen). \n\nFind someone who shares your life goals and lifestyle.", "> Tbh we are perfectly compatible with all other things.\n\nBut it only takes the one.", "Right, but did your boss offer it because you had previously expressed interest in working abroad? I'm asking because you're making yourself seem like a passive participant in this opportunity that just landed on your lap, as if it wasn't something you've already been working toward professionally, regardless of the consequences for your marriage.", "U only want a congratulations...but in another comment ' you want to discuss logistics' ' whether it's doable or not'.\n\n\nU literally made ur own bed. When both have such drastically different aims, such situations are bound to occur. Don't make it seem like a sacrifice when you chose to do it. \n\n\nI am like you. Going abroad and even settling there is what I WANT. And why will I involve another guy in my life who wants no such thing and then try to manipulate things when such situation arises.", "You are the AH.\n\nWhat would you expect?\n\nThat he is happy you're leaving for 6 months??  After you had agreed against any more long distance relationships.\n\nYou are selfish and manipulative. \n\nPerhaps you two should think of a permanent end to your relationship, or sounds like you want different things in life.", "You always knew what he was like and this would be a 3rd round of long distance which you already agreed not to do. I don't think there's a need for a counselor; it's not wrong of him to be upset that you're going back on your agreement not to go abroad for extended periods.", "How can there be room to compromise? Youre moving the goal post and hes not entertaining it. Long distance as gf and bf might work and usually it doesnt but as wife and husband its much different. Would he have married you if you hadnt promised him that you wouldnt do this? Youre still young so im betting that when you go abroad, he will find someone else and cheat on you. You will find someone and cheat on him.", "Probably because LDR are absolutely miserable and definitely not be something I would do if I were married.", "r/aita loves to offer divorce as the first resort. Think it over and I'm sure you will make something work between you two", "But you guys already discuss this three years ago and said no more long distance. What happens in three or five years when you get another opportunity like this? Is he expected to do long distance again. what if you have kids what happens then? I think you need to think long and hard and decide what you can\u2019t live without.", "Yep just going through checkin and security will often take at least 2hrs in bigger airports, especially for international flights.", "She is not screwing over her husband for sharing the opportunity and wanting to have an adult conversation.", "He's acting like a child because he's pouting over it. They should BOTH want what's best for the other. In this situation it's her taking that job and him for staying to finish. Once they are both done then they can decide what comes next. There's no reason to turn down the opportunity especially when they don't have other obligations like children.", "Really?  It stings?? What did you expect after you both agreed no more travel! Did you expect him to do a little dance for you. Of course he is not going to congratulate you, he doesn\u2019t want you to go and most likely feels resentment you are even considering/talking about it after you agreed no more. If you have it in heart to go then go. Roll the dice and if he is not there when you return don\u2019t be surprised. If he is there when you return , then fantastic outcome!", "It\u2019s a definitely a tough decision. It think the question is what are your top priorities. If you try working on goals instead of making it about each of you personally you might be able to find some common ground. \n\nYWNBTA \u2014 if you took the job but you may not have a marriage if you do. Wish y\u2019all the best!", "Absolutely we can do long distance. We discussed 3 years ago that we want to settle in one place for longer (as both of us would move places, cities or even countries as often as once a year). But it\u2019s been 3 years in the same city, I\u2019d be gone for 6 months and the flight is only 2h long.", "I think you nailed it. He seems fine with it, even jokes that he can quit job and be a stay at home husband, but perhaps it hurts him deep down. And yes, even if it came down to me staying here it would be 100 times easier should he phrase it this way instead of being cold and distant.", "The dog is much more attached to me than him and he doesn\u2019t like to be left with her alone for long, so I\u2019d be better for both if she came with me.", "No, because I get it - you can be happy for someone and sad that it means they could go away for months. It\u2019s just pure resentment from him and it honestly hurts.", "My husband comes first. I quit my job abroad and came back to our home country to be with him. I do not want to leave this marriage for this nor any job. I\u2019m hurt that he becomes cold and distant whenever the topic comes up instead of just sitting down and talking. I need to give an answer within a few days and there\u2019s no luck in any conversation with him.", "Honestly would you say this if the situation was flipped - if he was going for his job?", "It\u2019s only 6 months and they\u2019re young and don\u2019t have kids yet. What better time could there ever be for an opportunity like this?", "My boss said that he sees no better person for this, as I\u2019m very adaptive, know a few languages which is crucial here and I proved to be able to juggle between tasks concerning our team, projects, getting new clients and moving the business forward.", "So OP shouldn\u2019t try and advance their career because of her husband?", "I want him to sit down and discuss this as a couple instead of getting angry and short with me. Yeah, congartulations wouldn\u2019t hurt, but if we say down and talked together on the logistics and it would end up with me not going - I\u2019d accept it. The thing is he doesn\u2019t want to talk, just wants me to say no.", "Okay, what makes me manipulative here? I understand that accepting the offer might come as selfish, but manipulative?? I\u2019ve always been open with my expectations on career and living and it was never a problem until now.", "Think maybe you're projecting here", "Nah. Not she's not the asshole. Partners should be supporting. It's 6 months! Jeeze. I say do it with zero regrets. If this curates frustration/anger then perhaps he is not the one. You will regret not going every single week of that six months you are with him if he continues to act like a pain in the butt.", "That\u2019s the thing - we don\u2019t have kids yet, so it might be the last time when I can do this.", "They had a conversation 3 yrs ago in which they discussed and agreed no more LDR. She apparently lied to him about that because now she wants to go abroad; if he goes with her, he can't start his own career, if she goes without him, she reneged on that agreement. \n\nThey already had the conversation.", "We didn\u2019t say \u201eNo more travel ever\u201d, I explained that more in a different comment.", "Don\u2019t let Reddit put intentions on your husband. He probably just doesn\u2019t want o be away from his wife for so long. It\u2019s probably not misogyny or feeling threatened.  It\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re his wife(not girlfriend) and leaving for half a year.", "My cousin's company paid travel expenses to go home to see her family every weekend.  They are some really big company on the coast of the US and she lived in a bigger Midwest town. Perhaps this could be a thing you could negotiate for", "OP, this is a case of your life and what you really want to do. From the sounds of it you two are very different people. Especially the fact that you are dedicated to language learning and traveling and your partner.. Doesn\u2019t seem to share that at all? \n\nI\u2019m more thinking about how your husband doesn\u2019t want to discuss this at all, despite how excited you seem about it. You\u2019ve sacrificed your job for him before, and he is settling down very strongly where he is. \n\nThis seems like more of a thing for therapists to sort out, not Reddit. But you need to address the fact that it\u2019s not going to likely be a coral life like your husband desires, since you obviously want to explore a lot in this point in life. And that\u2019s ok though if it\u2019s against the promise Three Whole Years ago; relationships change and the people and places we think we want to be in life don\u2019t always turn out to be as we expect. \n\nNAH so long as your husband isn\u2019t trying to guilt you.", "Dont listen to these wishy washy people. The answer is pretty obvious you talked before you wouldnt do this, obviously hes pissed youd try to have him \"compromise\". But his attitude is shit. Tbh i think hes divorcing you if you go through with it and his reaction now is him mentally checking out of this marriage", "Not everyone is a great communicator, but in this case I think part of the issue is that this is a topic you have already communicated on and reached a decision... then you went back on the decision. I don't think him shutting down is great but I can understand why he might given he's both a poor communicator and he's already communicated with you on this topic and you jointly reached a decision.\n\nIf you accept, you should accept knowing that this may end your marriage. This was an issue that was already decided upon in your relationship. If you change the decision unilaterally it's a bit ridiculous to expect that the relationship will survive.", "That doesn't answer my question. YTA, not for accepting the job, but for making it look like your husband is holding back, and you don't have a choice about accepting your dream promotion. Your choice was made when you began putting things in motion at work. You and your husband clearly are on different paths in life and it'd probably be better to go your separate ways.", "*Radical feminist detected.*", "Did you guys not discuss this 3 yrs ago? \n\nLike i get its a new opportunity but similar situation and from what i can tell in his point of view would be at a worse time. \nYou siad you agreed not to do this again then brought it up and expect him to congratulate you?", "Part of your husband is feeling that you've lied to him. You agreed to no more living abroad and have now decided to take a job where you'll be living abroad.\n\nHe's very likely thinking that if you lied to him about that, will you being lying about coming home once the six months is up?\n\nI can understand his feelings if this is the case and if it is then he should be telling you this himself.", "You're not manipulative; previous response was harsh and non constructive.", "But your already going back on your word now what\u2019s to say you won\u2019t go back in your word when you do have kids.", "Agreed. That plus their agreement not to do the long distance thing again. \n\nI think this is a NAH situation. Husband isn\u2019t unreasonable for not wanting to move now and OP isn\u2019t unreasonable for wanting to take the huge promotion. They will have to talk.", "They talked years ago & decided they no longer wanted to do long distance under different circumstances. It would be ludicrous to hold her to that given this apparently life changing job offer, which presents new circumstances & offers her not just financial freedom but is something she literally described as a dream come true.

The whole pandemic was three years, massive difference between high school and adulthood, and in general so much can happen in those 1,095 days.\n\nYou can\u2019t predict that far in the future.

If they didnt see eye to eye on it why stay/agree to it in firstplace. She wasnt a kid.", "It sounds like you guys want vastly different things and/views on journey to those. Its probably tiresome always trying to be supportive of something he doesnt have interest in doing/ that he feels will negatively impact the relationship.  \n\nI dont get why you guys are still together if these are truly things both of you desire deeply and cannot be achieved in unison."]}
