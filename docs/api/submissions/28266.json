So I stayed.\n\n\nWhen we talked about the opportunity, he instantly became cold and short with me. We are speaking etc. normally, but anytime the topic comes up, he gets annoyed.

That will inevitably lead to what ifs, which will then lead to regret & that will lead to resentment of your bf for holding you back from your dreams. That or you'll break up, feel dumb & resent yourself instead. Follow your dreams. If your relationship can't withstand something so positive that you've always wanted & what could arguably be considered the best thing that's ever happened in your professional life, then it's not the right relationship for you. Neither of you ATA. Life just happens. Good luck!", "NAH, this is a true conflict. It really sounds like you two are fundamentally incompatible. I'd say no one is right and no one is wrong, it's just you don't have the same goals or even ideas of what a fun day looks like. So, the only question is, do you have a deep love for each other that is worth the sacrifices that one or both of you will have to make to stay together", "YTA already. \n\nIt seems like you and your husband are fundamentally incompatible, but the thing that stands out to me is - you agreed that you didn't want to go abroad anymore, yet in this post, you talk about how you dream of an international career. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, but you made your husband think you didn't want to do that anymore, and it is turning out to be a lie. \n\nYou need to understand that for him, you are going back on your previous agreement. He is hurt and upset because you've seen some shiny opportunity, and rather than abiding by your previous discussion of not moving abroad anymore, you expect him to sit down and rehash everything out. Even here, you're looking for justification for *why it's okay for you to break your previous agreement.* \n\nThat is what makes you the AH. Not you wanting something else, but you misleading him about something that makes you fundamentally incompatible.", "NAH, Maybe it worked for you the first 2 times you were long distance but clearly he wasnt happy. It sounds to me like you have 2 very different goals/visions of your future and should probably make sure those align at least somewhat closely before you guys end up having kids.", "Did you (a) just randomly get this job offer, or (b) did you apply for it (already knowing your husbands position on the matter) *then* get it?", "NAH multiple things can be true\n\n- for you - family is alway more important than job and money.  Putting family first is NOT a bad thing despite all the comments here saying \u2018you have to prioritize you\u2019.   Sometimes putting family first requires sacrifice.  \n\n- for your husband - sometimes you need to step outside your comfort zone to grow.  It can be scary, but supporting your spouse and growing is awesome.\n It is reasonable to go but have an agreement that if it is miserable that you will seek an early oppty to return.\n\nWhen I was young I did an internship on Wall Street in the US in high finance.  I was good at it and got a job offer.  I enjoyed the work and could have made tons of money early.  The problem was a married a country Texas girl who would have despised living in NYC.  She would have gone but I knew she would have hated it. \n\nI choose to not ask her to go and instead got a job where I travelled a good amount which I enjoyed but we got to live where she loved, had family, and was comfortable.  Now 20 years later we live in a nice country property and where I thought I wouldn\u2019t enjoy it I love the quiet life and culture here.  \n\n\n\nCommunication is key!  Good luck", "\"**We** discussed that **we** don't want a LDR anymore.\" Now **you** want a LDR \"against your husbands wishes\".\n\nIf both of you realized that a LDR is not good for your relationship, then this job opportunity should never have been considered in the first place.

His reaction seems a little extreme by not being willing to have a proper conversation with you (maybe he needs time to process?) but I think him being upset is understandable given that he doesn\u2019t want move countries (is it somewhere he doesn\u2019t know the language? Coz if so that\u2019d be very isolating for him) or disrupt his own career goals by doing so. Tie that in with the fact you both already agreed you wouldn\u2019t do long distance again \u2026 yeah I can see why he\u2019d be upset.

This isn't really an AITA.  You and your husband need to sit down and find a way to overcome this difference in lifestyle choices.

That\u2019s the thing - this offer is a positive thing for me and the reaction I get from him is only resentment, which is just sad. If he said I\u2019m very happy and proud, but xyz - then we can discuss logistics and decide whether it\u2019s doable or not. I\u2019d be more than happy for a discussion.

I thought he\u2019d at least congratulate me for getting such an amazing offer EVEN IF it\u2019s not doable. Then it\u2019d be all easier for me.

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s sth building up in him and needing a counselor to get to the bottom of it. He always knew how I am and what I want and it was OK. This year some shift happened.", "Thank you for your honesty. I just feel like there\u2019s not much room for compromise here. I understand that he wants to stay 100%. He doesn\u2019t want to do long distance either, so it\u2019s either his way or my way. I am currently sad that he didn\u2019t even congratulate me nor seemed proud in any way, just sees this as an inconvenience. Perhaps some time is needed for our emotions to cool down and we can sit down again and find a way.", "I don't understand the point honestly. It's six months. People act like it's the end times here.

She's going back on that and screwing her husband over on his career.", "They're pretty much in the exact same situation. She has a career opportunity while he's about to finish exams that will lead to a career opportunity.

Now she springs this on her husband. What if this keeps happening? If she\u2019s successful, she will probably be tasked with opening other branches as well. How long will OP\u2019s husband have to put up with this? First time it\u2019s 6months next one could be the same or longer, who knows? This is something they need to figure out together or they might as well just save the time and trouble and get divorced.", "Well, I didn't want to say that last bit. It sounds a bit judgy.", "You want him to sit down and be talked into what you want. You already KNOW what he wants, and he knows what you want. You two are obviously incompatible, and the way you talked about him in your post makes me think that you are regretting your marriage. Hey, maybe you will meet someone more exciting than your boring old husband who only knows one language.", "WTF would he be congratulating you for? This is bad news for him and your relationship. You want him to congratulate you on the worst news possible for his marriage? lol, holy crap.", "Just guessing here but:\n\n\\-He wants for you to achieve your goals in life\n\n\\-He loves you\n\n\\-He won't do long distance anymore\n\nSo yeah, when you said \"I got this amazing opportunity\" what he probably heard was \"I got this amazing opportunity that I need to accept that involves the end of our marriage\". Don't be surprised if he's not excited about it and doesn't want to talk about it.\n\nAlso, congratulations on the opportunity I really hope you take it! My life involved a break from my (now) wife when she went abroad for a year. Not saying you have to take a break but it really seems to me you should experience this dream life of yours for a while at least.", "No,  you've not been \"open\" with your expectations on your career.\n\nYou stated you both agreed to no more long distance  situations. \n\nAnd you want to convince your husband to agree to going back on your word even though he is,  obviously, upset and not on board.\n\nSelfish and manipulative...", ">Okay, what makes me manipulative here?\n\nLying to him to further trap him in the relationship is about as manipulative as you can get. Telling him you weren't going to do long distance anymore and going back on that would be a hell of a deal breaker for me, no matter what decision you ultimately settle on.", "You are absolutely NOT manipulating in this situation. It\u2019s normal to want our spouses to congratulate us when we have great news. It\u2019s normal and healthy for couples to discuss things like this even if there was a \u201cpromise\u201d 3 years prior about not going abroad. Life changes constantly. We learn to adapt and that\u2019s why we talk about things. For her husband to shut down and not even talk about it - that\u2019s not an open and honest reaction.  He should want to support his wife. He should want to see her happy. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s asking to permanently move abroad. It\u2019s 6 months. \n\nBeing married is more than just holding hands, kissing, etc. It takes a lot of work. Open communication, honesty, give and take. We support our spouses in every endeavor. We love, respect and most importantly we don\u2019t hold things over our spouses heads. Especially when it comes to thinks like a career.", "Do you know what a marriage is? You sound like a teenager. \u201cNo regrets.\u201d GMAB", "\"Projecting\" what?\n\nAnd how?", "what your husband feels is valid op.", "I think that\u2019s reasonable and kind of why people shouldn\u2019t get married so young to be honest. You both have valid wants and goals. I don\u2019t think that you husband should have to have a conversation again about how he\u2019s feeling when he\u2019s communicated to you that he doesn\u2019t want to move and would prefer to not do long distance. You know what his stance is. If this is an important enough opportunity for you, then take it knowing that it might end your marriage. That\u2019s honestly completely okay. But he\u2019s not TA for not talking to you about it when he\u2019s already made his feelings clear.", "The husband seems like he doesn\u2019t want to do any more LDR, period, and I don\u2019t blame him. LD fucking sucks ass and is definitely not something I\u2019d consider when married, outside of extremely exigent circumstances. \n\nI agree with NAH, but I just don\u2019t see this working without one of them completely acquiescing to the other\u2019s demands.", "Yeah, you just said \"no long distance ever.\" Now you are either changing your mind or forcing him to abandon his own career. YTA.", "Stuff happens and they can have another conversation honestly. If it's a great opportunity but not feasible then they need to discuss it.", "His choice to stay in country would mean LDR and screw OP over and tank her career if she stays with him. He can do what he wants with his career, just has to decide if he wants that more than his marriage", "Here's the thing when I read your post and your age, from the perspective of a woman who turned 42 this year: you're 26. You have over ten years to think about having kids. Now is the time that you should be having fun with your career and traveling, whether for work or pleasure, because these things all become much more difficult with children. Not impossible, but more difficult. And maybe the two of you are not compatible in the long run, which is something to think about, too.", "Exactly. She's saying he won't have a conversation, but she seems to mean \"he won't agree to what I want\".", "I'd upvote this several times if I could. They agreed they didn't want to do the abroad thing and then as soon as she gets a better offer she's ready to dip. If I were OPs husband and she went anyway despite my feelings, that would be such a smack in the face it would would likely end the relationship. I hope OP is prepared to be heart broken and abroad without any support system.", "Just because he's not having a 50th conversation about it, doesn't make him a bad communicator. Dude's said \"no, I don't want that\" plenty of times. Now he's unhappy again & instead of ripping her a new one, he just keeps to himself. I think that's pretty mature, to be honest", "On top of that he's probably feeling extremely hurt and possibly wondering why her job is more important than he is.\n\nOP if you truly love your husband, I think it would be a mistake to start a LDR again, a lot can happen is 6 months.", "I don't see the problem with wanting your partner to a) support your excitement for a cool opportunity or b) be willing to entertain the conversation of \"Is there a way we can make this work?\"\n\nIf that answer is, \"No, there's absolutely no way,\" then at least she can make the decision from an informed position.\n\nIn your example about poly\\*amory\\* (which is not the same as polygamy), if someone does bring up the conversation and the answer is \"absolutely not\", then the people involved can make an informed decision to what degree they're willing to sacrifice or compromise. If one wants it that bad, but the other doesn't, they can decide together if that's enough of a fundamental mismatch that they should split.\n\nBut to not even entertain the conversation is just more likely to create resentment from one or both parties instead, which will ultimately be worse.", "He doesn\u2019t want to discus it because they\u2019ve already discussed it 2 times when she left for more than a year each time. And after the last he was clear he was not ok with it. \n\nIf she wants to chose career over husband then she can and just let him move on and she can too. But to expect to do it her way ie discuss it even though they already have previously, and then before that as well, is incredible selfish. He wants to stay as they are and not to move, if she wants to move, then she can and stop trying to drag him.", "She already agreed not to take this job three years ago. They already talked about it, and they both made a choice and agreed to how they were going to live thier lives, now she is trying to go back on her agreement and her word.", "Her talking about being site manager etc makes me think she intends to stay longer than six months.", "That honestly sounds like an awful way to live", "Would he be wrong to ask for a divorce? He had made his position clear. She initially agreed but has now changed her mind. If he hasn't, then divorce is the best option. These travelling opportunities will keep coming and once kids get involved that complicates things even more. They already have issues with just a pet.", "Sorry what\u2019s the husband supposed to do now?", ">Ok, you've proven that marriage is important to you - now it's time for your husband to prove that your happiness and growth is important to him.\n\nLol how the fuck did she do that? Her and her husband made an agreement together and now that it's not convenient for only OP she's unilaterally changing that agreement", "Why would they go their separate ways? It\u2018s only six months. Maybe they are very compatible and this is their only issue. As OP said they are planning family together soon so she will probably become more domesticated herself and it seems she\u2018s aware of it. He could just go with her or wait for her. Happy marriage is hard work not quitting.", "Do you mean \u201ctake the job at all costs\u201d?", "Absolutely agree, 40yr old woman here, please OP, listen to your wise older sisters! A relationship should make your world bigger, not smaller. You have no children and this is a 6 month contract, I strongly advise you to take it. In my experience, a man who devalues your dreams and pours negativity on your opportunities won't change. This shouldn't be a battle you have to fight your whole life. If you turn this down now you'll be doing it your whole life. He will always be the reason not to do things. If you had children the decision would be different, but don't let one man clip your wings, please. Grab the opportunity with both hands, you've worked hard for this and you deserve it.", "Yea but we're all thinking it", "Yes, this is why I think it's important to OP to be sure that this is a temporary position. She goes there for 6 months make the savings they need for their future and deny any other positions that will move her to a place without her husband. If they want a baby and a house in 1 or 2 years this money can be really helpful.", "She's already making 3x his salary, and this undoubtedly will NOT tank her career as she's already advanced significantly. He on the other had us just about to get his certifications and if they move out of country, they are useless, thus tanking his career.", "If she takes the job, it screws OP's husband over and tanks his career or destroys thier marriage. OP is at fault here, not the husband. \n\nOP is an asshole for even thinking about it after the agreement they made.", "How old are your kids right now as a 42 year old woman though?", "How did you come to that conclusion? It sounds to me like he refused discussion immediately.", "Times and circumstances change\u2026so she\u2019s not an A H for wanting to discuss this again. He\u2019s not one for wanting the status quo either\u2026but him over ruling her career advancement is controlling. Despite the claims of some of the replies\u2026this isn\u2019t a job or marriage decision\u2026it\u2019s something they need to discuss, negotiate, and agree on. As I said in another reply\u2026Navy ships routinely deploy for longer than 6 months\u2026and both careers, marriages, and kids (which aren\u2019t an issue here) survive just fine.", "That's a shitty thing to say. What if I said that if OP loved his wife, he wouldn't clip her wings by expecting her to stay in their country?", "In my example as in the one with polyamory, they had already discussed it. Do they need to discuss her possibly moving every time she has an opportunity to work abroad when he has already made his position clear. OP in several of her comments has alluded to that fact. This is not about the husband refusing to communicate as I see it. This is about her wanting a different answer.", "Isn\u2019t he also choosing his career over his wife?", "Personally, id call it quits. Once you get married those traveling dreams are either for two or theyre just dreams. Only way i see anyone doing this is if theyre so poor that going abroad would change their life like night and day and one of them has to do it. Or else its just one person having a nice vacation and new life while their partner waits for them like a dumb clown", "Goes on dates for months, sweet talks romances each other, plans a wedding with their loved once, gets on the alter and recite their memorized vowels, goes through the holy and pure process with someone ordained by the religion, while looking each other in the eye and making the promise to be with each other.\n\n\n\"Sorry but my real dream is to work for someone abroad\"", "Their dreams don't align. They are only in their 20s and she's already spent more than 2 years of their relationship in a different country. There is nothing wrong with his \"dream\" being to settle down and stay in the country.\n\n\nIt doesn't mean either of their dreams are wrong, but at some point, any \"compromise\" would involve them both giving up more than they are comfortable with.", "The husband needs to stop being self-centered, accommodate OP goals and opportunity to grow and be happy.", "For clarity, I'm not saying end your relationship for a 6 month contract. I'm saying there are many ways to make this work, and if you don't take this opportunity this time, he will never be open to making your opportunities work over your shared life together. He will shut it down every time. He can and should be open to talking to you about this, the cold shoulder is absolutely no good. Maybe counselling will help you work through it, but whatever happens, please don't sacrifice this dream.", "No I\u2019m sorry but no. She IS unreasonable for having a long distance marriage.", "Again yeah, it seems like your interests are gonna conflict in this relationship long term if that\u2019s the reaction for any sort of holiday and the communication doesn\u2019t occur. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate but I guess there was an expectation of \u2018settling down\u2019 that sort of was maybe hoped for by your husband as a phase, that wasn\u2019t that shallow in reality.", "Sounds like he is absolutely heads down trying to finish up his certifications and pass his exam?  Which if it is anything like the BAR, is a BIG deal, and extremely stressful. \n\nHaving his wife trying to blow up his marriage for a job opportunity and being completely selfish and unrealistic isn't helping....", "OP I think you really need to consider whether this relationship is going to work for you. Fundamentally, it sounds like you two have very different goals and paths you want to go down in life, and unless you guys can come to a good compromise that both of you will be happy with, it will just build resentments on either side of the relationship and tear you guys apart.", "Lets not kid ourselves here. Its a dream come true for you, meaning you at least had an inkling that this is possible and worked on it. Not saying you shouldn't,  just dont be the ah that feigns ignorance and blames the husband for not accomodating your whim. ( You're the one who went back on your promise)", "It could work out nicely for them but I just hesitate to think it will. I think no matter how they compromise on this, one or both of them will harbor resentment towards the other. Either OP will resent husband for holding her career back or her husband will resent her for going back on her promise or whatever. One of them will have to bend to keep the relationship from breaking but I just don\u2019t see how they can really reconcile this without bitterness on either side. Their goals just seems so incompatible at the moment.\n\nI think ideally, husband should suck it up for 6 months with *ABSOLUTE* understanding that they will do no more LDR after that. Barring that, I can\u2019t think of a feasible solution.", "So you think turning down an advancement opportunity in an established career is less risky than delaying accreditation in a career that hasn't even started? He has no career to tank yet. Delaying that by a year does nothing. On the other hand she's been flagged as a high performer and the worst thing she can do is pump the brakes when opportunities present themselves. That's a quick way to not get opportunities in the future.", "No one is an asshole for **considering** future possibilities. \n\nThe husband getting emotional over a potentially wonderful opportunity without even discussing it is downright immature. Especially consider their relatively young ages.", "He doesn't have a career yet. He's *about* to start one. She's the one being offered a chance at a career boosting opportunity.\n\nOP isn't \"at fault\" for being so good at her job she was offered an opportunity she's excited about. If she turns this down because her husband wants to be an anchor around her neck, she will rightfully resent him for it.\n\nHe has absolutely nothing to lose by supporting her in this.", "He expressed that he doesn't want to go, and that he's not saying no but he won't be happy with her going. He's spent years expressing that he doesn't want to travel/move more. \n\n\nWhat else can he say?", "What about her decision to uproot their ENTIRE LIVES? You don\u2019t think that\u2019s selfish and controlling? Well, I mean, it is from a woman so.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s overruling her career advancement. I think he\u2019s made it clear that he won\u2019t be moving and that if she wants to go by herself she can but he won\u2019t be happy about it because he already expressed years ago that he doesn\u2019t want a long distance relationship. It\u2019s okay to say \u201cthis thing that will make you happy doesn\u2019t work for me\u201d and decide that maybe you\u2019re not the right fits for each other.", "Yeah, folks here acting like they made some kind of blood pact. In a functional marriage, any otherwise reasonable topic that is 100% not open for discussion has the potential to lead to resentments. This is a problem for the couple to tackle as a couple, not a problem that should be one partner vs. the other. (Re)negotiation and compromise is the cornerstone of a healthy relationship.\n\nPeople here also asking like she's moving to the \\*literal opposite end of the world forever\\* and not a two-hour flight away for only 6 months. I've driven longer than that for a long weekend, and if they want her that bad, the company would probably pay for one or the other to travel for visits.", "I personally think he should, but she more or less made a deal not to go long distance and if not that he has to sabotage his fledgeling career. It\u2019s very awkward but it\u2019s hardly a black and white case of he should simply do whatever.", "She literally says that's his worry and she understands which to me at least means she likely agrees. Unless you're OP or her husband, how can you possibly say that it won't tank his career? You have absolutely no idea what this could mean to his career.\n\nFrom the sounds of it OP is a a monster in her career and if declining this offer for the reasons she stated keeps her company from ever offering her an opportunity in the future the that's a shitty place to work anyway. Any job that punishes you for choosing your family and a healthy work life balance and very possibly cause you your marriage isn't worth it, to me at least.", "I find this very weird. It's just 6 months, why are they talking about moving? It's a 2 hour flight, so he could go visit her (or the other way around) on a week and just get back to your country Monday mid morning and at work by afternoon. \n\nDoes OP believe that she/they could stay over there, because she will be branch manager?", "She isn\u2019t uprooting\u2026she\u2019s going for six months to stand up a new office. If she wants to move there permanently\u2026then that\u2019s a discussion they need to have. But as an old Navy sailor\u20266 months away from family is just part of the career. I said that him having universal veto over her career path is over controlling\u2026and it is\u2026just as she would be over controlling his career path if the genders were switched. Please review again where this is a temporary thing and where I already said if she wants it permanently they need to discuss and come to some mutually acceptable conclusion\u2026and the basis of that conclusion is up to them.", "Which is fine. That may be the case. But to pout about it and not even have that conversation is pretty immature and unsupportive. Which, at the core, seems the real concern here.", "To me it is pretty simple:  It would be ridiculous for OP to pass on this opportunity for advancement and growth.  6 months is not a long time and two hours is not a long distance to be apart.\n\nI am guessing that OP's husband is afraid that this is just a beginning.  And, I would also guess that he would probably be right, but that's the bridge to cross when they get there.", "Thank you! I know where I am, so this is on me, but this is the sticking point for me. A partnership requires constant communication as life changes. If someone is willing to refuse to communicate regarding such a huge decision, then that is a problem.", "They\u2019ve already crossed the bridge. OP already moved abroad twice. This is the third time after he told her he does not want it. OP is being self centred who is having everything on her terms."]}
