And the fact that the principal sees nothing wrong with the teacher humiliating your daughter is worrisome too. If the teachers treat the kid poorly, the classmates tend to follow the example of the teacher. Kids are very easily influenced, and every staff member in a school should know that.", "NTA, as a teacher myself you never comment on Children's backgrounds or circumstances, you see the child as an individual in your class who's there to learn, if they're happy and healthy, where they're from or what their parents do is none of my business, that's extremely unprofessional and a massive AH move.\n\nReport this higher up the school, make a fuss and get the teacher reprimanded. Don't just remove your kid from the class straight away, they'll lose friends, routine amd normalcy, the teacher and the school should make amends here, if they don't, then go nuclear and remove your kid.", "NTA - While your work out a class transfer, require a meeting with the principal and the teacher. Submit your complaints in writing; be very detailed. This type of math lesson, interrogation and an ill inform conversation is very inappropriate. What about kids raised by grandparents with no knowledge of their parent's age....the list of family compositions is endless. You are not the AH for confronting the teacher.", "NTA but the teacher definitely is. I understand her being surprised with the age of the parents at first and confirming it, but everything she said after that was out of line. Idk if it is necessary to switch classes but I don't blame you for wanting to.", "NTA at all. That is a completely inappropriate thing for the teacher to say/bring up. There are plenty of parents your age.", "You are so, so, SO NTA. I would go scorched earth.\n\nEveryone\u2019s family is different. If a teacher cannot grasp that, they should not be a teacher.", "NTA. I am unmarried and would be furious if my daughter\u2019s teacher did this.", "Wow... not ok to humiliate a kid like that. NTA.", "NTA. Teacher overstepped boundaries and the principal wrongly backed her up. Time to go to the school board office and file a complaint against both of them. If they won't assign another teacher you may have to change schools or get the media involved.", "NTA \n\nYou are doing the right thing for your daughter. She should not be shamed for what a teacher thinks is \u201cincorrect\u201d. I\u2019m sorry this happened to your daughter", "NTA Im sorry you feel that you even needed to post this. That's disgusting. I consider myself and my families household very traditional, wouldn't personally have it any other way. But that is absolutely none of her concern and beyond disgusting response. Not her job to instill or inquire about a families structure or makeup unless a child is showing obvious signs of being abused.", "NTA as a teacher that is none of her business, you can talk shit about the parents in the staff room but never in front of the kids. And 18yo is not that weird I have 14yo students who are at their second kid, life is just different for everyone, who is she to judge you ?", "NTA.   If the principal is ignoring it, I might send a complaint to the school board.  The teacher's behavior was absolutely unacceptable.", "NTA teacher was totally out of line", "NTA. That was wildly inappropriate and puts your child in a bad position.", "NTA and not overreacting. The teacher was way out of line for her remark.

Judging you is one thing, but shaming your daughter because of it is an absolute AH move. She isn't fit to be a teacher if she is mocking her young students.", " Same thing happened to us when our daughter started elementary school. The teacher wanted to know how old her parents were and if we are married. We look really young but I had my daughter the week before I turned 23 and my husband was 25.

And the teacher needs to be reprimanded or have sensitivity training at minimum. I would reflect on if you daughter wants to switch classes. If all her friends are in her class, that could be rough..at that same time, what the teacher did was toxic. She knows people come from all backgrounds.

It\u2019s not going to do anything to the teacher but will have huge ramifications on your kid who will be punished for something entirely out of their control. Kids talk, they\u2019re mean, she\u2019ll have to go to school and explain to others why she\u2019s not part of their class or be singled out.

Some teachers get too comfortable in their classrooms and this is one of those situations. They are there to teach and develop children. Not provide commentary on the lives of others.", "NTA at all!\n\nThat was a completely inappropriate and unprofessional thing to say. If they refuse to move her, take it to the superintendent or school board.", "NTA. Many schools are trying to move away from this kind of task sheet for this exact reason. Families are complicated. Sometimes there are young parents, sometimes there are dead parents, sometimes there is divorce and abuse, sometimes there are 2 moms or dads. Inevitably these kinds of tasks bring up awkward topics, or topics that might be \"controversial\".\n\nOnce the teacher established that your child's math was not wrong, the *professional* response would have been to move on and act like nothing was wrong. Instead the teacher used your child as some kind of demented moral lesson.\n\nGo above the school. If the school has a board or a superintendent go to them. \"I acknowledge that I was a young parent. While not ideal, there is no shame in that and I love my child. The teacher saw fit to tell all the children in her class that my daughter was less, and that my partner and I are bad people, because we had a child young. The principal sees no problem in the teacher opening my child up to bullying because of their misplaced belief that they can judge me. I want my child moved out of that class and I want it made clear to the principal and the teacher that any further judgement of me or my child will not be acceptable.\"", "NTA.  Super unprofessional of that teacher.  She humiliated your child amd made her an object of ridicule to her classmates.  Also, not her place to be passing judgement or making comments about your marital status.  I would file a formal complaint with the School Board against the teacher and the principal.", "I\u2018d be leaving footprints on the principal\u2019s face going over her head.  The composition of your family is nobody\u2019s business except your own unless there\u2019s abuse or broken laws.", "It was not an entire lesson. From what I\u2019ve gathered, it was a worksheet or a bunch of questions she was asking the entire class. One question was \u201chow old is your mom, and how old is your dad?\u201d And then \u201c- how old you are\u201d teacher just asked my kid to answer that question for the class. \n\nAnother question during that lesson was like \u201chow many hours are in a day - how many hours you sleep= how many hours you are awake\u201d", "I don't agree that she'd be an AH for removing the daughter from the class. She's 8 and most likely has very little she can do to stand up to a teacher that is willing to bully her. Also at 8 her friendships are still changing and forming all the time. I think it's more important she protect her daughter from the unremorseful teacher.", "This! I was thinking the same thing. Yes, OP should confront the teacher. Yes OP should have spoken to the principle. I understand OP's instinct to want to pull her kid out of the  class but like your comment stated the only person punished would be your  daughter not the teacher. I think OP should talk to her daughter first about what the teacher did and ask her daughter if she wants to switch teachers.", "Thxs for clarifying. One could say almost everything that occurs in a classroom is a teaching moment. In this scenario it was a match problem. The teacher made a conscious decision to use this tool, call on your daughter, & not engage her in a positive manner during a teaching moment. She demeaned your daughter's input while demonstrating to all students that they could be called 'wrong' in front of their peers. Best to you.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but.. what other ways is this teacher shaming students? Kids should love school and learning. School is supposed to be a safe place. it only takes one bad teacher to ruin it for a child. That fact she didn\u2019t even want to speak with her mother is definitely a red flag for me. I would also file a formal bullying complaint with the school district on the teacher", " I agree. Like I said I do think OP should express her concerns about what happened with the teacher and the principal.  Some people mentioned filing a complaint with the school and OP should do that  if she wants, but I don't think this would be considered a fireable offense. Especially if they live in the US. There is a teacher shortage going on and in some states they are lifting restrictions on teaching requirements. So I don't see many school districts letting a teacher go over this situation. Especially if they have been teaching for a long time. I think in the end it won't be what gets the teacher fired or even reprimanded. So the only person that will really be impacted by switching teachers  is OP's daughter. My point was that OP should talk to her daugther first to see if her daughter wants to switch rooms. I'm not saying that OP shouldn't have reported the teacher. I absolutely think she should I just don't have any hopes that it will have the impact OP wants it to have on the teacher.", "I meant to reply to above you didn\u2019t actually see you\u2019re comment until now"]}
