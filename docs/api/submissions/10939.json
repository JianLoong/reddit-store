If they refuse to move her, take it to the superintendent or school board.", "NTA. Many schools are trying to move away from this kind of task sheet for this exact reason. Families are complicated.

Inevitably these kinds of tasks bring up awkward topics, or topics that might be \"controversial\".\n\nOnce the teacher established that your child's math was not wrong, the *professional* response would have been to move on and act like nothing was wrong.

She's 8 and most likely has very little she can do to stand up to a teacher that is willing to bully her. Also at 8 her friendships are still changing and forming all the time. I think it's more important she protect her daughter from the unremorseful teacher.", "This! I was thinking the same thing. Yes, OP should confront the teacher. Yes OP should have spoken to the principle. I understand OP's instinct to want to pull her kid out of the  class but like your comment stated the only person punished would be your  daughter not the teacher. I think OP should talk to her daughter first about what the teacher did and ask her daughter if she wants to switch teachers.", "Thxs for clarifying. One could say almost everything that occurs in a classroom is a teaching moment. In this scenario it was a math problem. The teacher made a conscious decision to use this tool, call on your daughter, & not engage her in a positive manner during a teaching moment. She demeaned your daughter's input while demonstrating to all students that they could be called 'wrong' in front of their peers. Best to you.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but.. what other ways is this teacher shaming students? Kids should love school and learning. School is supposed to be a safe place. it only takes one bad teacher to ruin it for a child. That fact she didn\u2019t even want to speak with her mother is definitely a red flag for me. I would also file a formal bullying complaint with the school district on the teacher", " I agree. Like I said I do think OP should express her concerns about what happened with the teacher and the principal.  Some people mentioned filing a complaint with the school and OP should do that  if she wants, but I don't think this would be considered a fireable offense. Especially if they live in the US. There is a teacher shortage going on and in some states they are lifting restrictions on teaching requirements. So I don't see many school districts letting a teacher go over this situation. Especially if they have been teaching for a long time. I think in the end it won't be what gets the teacher fired or even reprimanded. So the only person that will really be impacted by switching teachers  is OP's daughter. My point was that OP should talk to her daugther first to see if her daughter wants to switch rooms. I'm not saying that OP shouldn't have reported the teacher. I absolutely think she should I just don't have any hopes that it will have the impact OP wants it to have on the teacher.", "I meant to reply to above you didn\u2019t actually see you\u2019re comment until now", " NTA- it\u2019s none of the teacher\u2019s business how old you are and if you are married!

I say this, to say, sometimes you should and need to disrupt the status quo. The public school system (in America) is really on the verge of collapse, it just isn\u2019t viable.

My 5th grade teacher constantly mocked and verbally abused me and put me down in front of the entire class. \n\nI\u2019m an adult now but I\u2019ll never forget it. It caused a lot of trauma for me and I fell into a very severe depression and had to be hospitalized three years later. \n\nI told my parents what was going on and they spoke to the principal. She told them this particular teacher was known for singling out one child every year and basically bullying them relentlessly, but they couldn\u2019t do anything about it because she had tenure. \n\nShe said if my parents made a \u201cfuss\u201d it would only make the teacher harder on me. She said the teacher didn\u2019t like intelligent female students. \n\nI was the only one in my class who was in a gifted and talented program at the school. It was called the TDA for Talent Development Association and she told the class that TDA stood for \u201ctiny dumb asses\u201d. So of course the rest of the class started calling me a tiny dumb ass. \n\nWhen my teacher would come to get me out of class for our TDA meetings, my regular teacher often refused. \n\nShe would mock me for my handwriting and copy what I wrote on the board and say things like \u201cCan anyone read this?\u201d \n\nShe routinely sent me to sit in the hall by myself as punishment for made up reasons like talking in class. I really didn\u2019t do that because I was so obedient, and frankly intimidated by adults. No other student was ever sent to sit in the hallway. \n\nI remember at the very beginning of the year she told me in front of the class \u201cI know you\u2019ve always been the teacher\u2019s pet before but in my class you\u2019re nothing special.\u201d \n\nI was an extremely well behaved, shy kid so it\u2019s not like this was a discipline problem. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget one time the kid sitting next to me made a loud fart noise and she immediately called me out by name and said \u201cBecky (not my real name) that\u2019s nasty! Do you need to go to the bathroom? It sounds like you should change your underwear.\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t really blame the other kids for their cruelty because they thought since the TEACHER was saying all these derogatory things, they must be true. \n\nI had never been bullied before and was well liked with plenty of friends, but over the course of that school year I lost almost all of my friends. Partly because of the things she said about me to the class and partly because I began to withdraw from my friends and everyone else because of my depression and anxiety over the hell I had to endure every day. \n\nI began to consider suicide until my Sunday school teacher said people who committed suicide would go to hell. That made my depression worse because now there was absolutely no way out for me. \n\nI stopped doing my extracurricular activities like ballet, which I loved up till then. I stopped accepting invitations for birthday parties and sleepovers and soon there were no more invitations. \n\nI will never understand why my parents didn\u2019t see how miserable I was and that I was clinically depressed. Especially because my father had a masters degree in psychiatric social work. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand why they didn\u2019t insist that I be moved to another class. They told me the principal said by the time this idea was brought up it was too late in the school year to switch classes. \n\nI think if that was the case they should have sent me to a different school.

Instead I developed serious problems, including extremely low self esteem and trust issues, which have continued into my adult life. \n\nSo please know you are DEFINITELY NTA!!

One told my mother I needed a \u201cgood hiding\u201d because I finished my work too early and got bored. I was four. And I\u2019m also autistic. My mother came home and cried because she couldn\u2019t get me away from that woman. She was vile. \n\nI think you should make a fuss, kick up some trouble for this asshole teacher.
