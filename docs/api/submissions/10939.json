If they refuse to move her, take it to the superintendent or school board.", "NTA. Many schools are trying to move away from this kind of task sheet for this exact reason. Families are complicated. Sometimes there are young parents, sometimes there are dead parents, sometimes there is divorce and abuse, sometimes there are 2 moms or dads. Inevitably these kinds of tasks bring up awkward topics, or topics that might be \"controversial\".\n\nOnce the teacher established that your child's math was not wrong, the *professional* response would have been to move on and act like nothing was wrong. Instead the teacher used your child as some kind of demented moral lesson.\n\nGo above the school. If the school has a board or a superintendent go to them. \"I acknowledge that I was a young parent. While not ideal, there is no shame in that and I love my child.

Super unprofessional of that teacher.  She humiliated your child amd made her an object of ridicule to her classmates.  Also, not her place to be passing judgement or making comments about your marital status.  I would file a formal complaint with the School Board against the teacher and the principal.", "I\u2018d be leaving footprints on the principal\u2019s face going over her head.  The composition of your family is nobody\u2019s business except your own unless there\u2019s abuse or broken laws.", "It was not an entire lesson. From what I\u2019ve gathered, it was a worksheet or a bunch of questions she was asking the entire class. One question was \u201chow old is your mom, and how old is your dad?\u201d And then \u201c- how old you are\u201d teacher just asked my kid to answer that question for the class. \n\nAnother question during that lesson was like \u201chow many hours are in a day - how many hours you sleep= how many hours you are awake\u201d", "I don't agree that she'd be an AH for removing the daughter from the class. She's 8 and most likely has very little she can do to stand up to a teacher that is willing to bully her. Also at 8 her friendships are still changing and forming all the time. I think it's more important she protect her daughter from the unremorseful teacher.", "This! I was thinking the same thing. Yes, OP should confront the teacher. Yes OP should have spoken to the principle. I understand OP's instinct to want to pull her kid out of the  class but like your comment stated the only person punished would be your  daughter not the teacher. I think OP should talk to her daughter first about what the teacher did and ask her daughter if she wants to switch teachers.", "Thxs for clarifying. One could say almost everything that occurs in a classroom is a teaching moment. In this scenario it was a math problem. The teacher made a conscious decision to use this tool, call on your daughter, & not engage her in a positive manner during a teaching moment. She demeaned your daughter's input while demonstrating to all students that they could be called 'wrong' in front of their peers. Best to you.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but.. what other ways is this teacher shaming students? Kids should love school and learning. School is supposed to be a safe place. it only takes one bad teacher to ruin it for a child. That fact she didn\u2019t even want to speak with her mother is definitely a red flag for me. I would also file a formal bullying complaint with the school district on the teacher", " I agree. Like I said I do think OP should express her concerns about what happened with the teacher and the principal.  Some people mentioned filing a complaint with the school and OP should do that  if she wants, but I don't think this would be considered a fireable offense. Especially if they live in the US. There is a teacher shortage going on and in some states they are lifting restrictions on teaching requirements. So I don't see many school districts letting a teacher go over this situation. Especially if they have been teaching for a long time. I think in the end it won't be what gets the teacher fired or even reprimanded. So the only person that will really be impacted by switching teachers  is OP's daughter. My point was that OP should talk to her daugther first to see if her daughter wants to switch rooms. I'm not saying that OP shouldn't have reported the teacher. I absolutely think she should I just don't have any hopes that it will have the impact OP wants it to have on the teacher.", "I meant to reply to above you didn\u2019t actually see you\u2019re comment until now", " NTA- it\u2019s none of the teacher\u2019s business how old you are and if you are married!

It's literally made no difference in my life or theirs. \n\nSet up another meeting with the principal and the teacher. Ask them if what the teacher said was kind necessary, or helpful. Ask them if that kind of comment would be tolerated from a student. If they agree that it was none of the above, request for your daughter to be put in another class. If they're still fighting you on it after that, report them both to the school board or whoever the next level of authority is.", "NTA. Teacher had no business commenting on your family's structure, your ages, etc. She embarrassed your daughter in front of the class. This is also a weird lesson/exercise/ whatever it's called.

Well maybe not.  But what the teacher said was completely inappropriate.\n\nIs this school a religious school?", "NTA. Report again and this time tell her if you're not gonna give an appropriate action for this the recording (just a threat) will reach the higher ups and let's see if it's only the teacher who will get a disciplinary action or both of them if you take legal action. \n\nOP i feel bad that your daughter had to hear that.

I cannot imagine asking such a personal question and as to the comment to the rest of the class!! No matter how irregular or unusual the family is, it is not ,nor ever should be, something that a teacher refers to or comments about.  I would not be happy about my child in that class. However, if the Principal does not support your wish to move, just hang in. Will your child move to another class next academic year? If so, just support and love your child, agree that the teacher is an AH, probably say something like \u2018misguided\u2019 and wait for time to pass.
