If they refuse to move her, take it to the superintendent or school board.", "NTA. Many schools are trying to move away from this kind of task sheet for this exact reason. Families are complicated. Sometimes there are young parents, sometimes there are dead parents, sometimes there is divorce and abuse, sometimes there are 2 moms or dads. Inevitably these kinds of tasks bring up awkward topics, or topics that might be \"controversial\".\n\nOnce the teacher established that your child's math was not wrong, the *professional* response would have been to move on and act like nothing was wrong. Instead the teacher used your child as some kind of demented moral lesson.\n\nGo above the school. If the school has a board or a superintendent go to them. \"I acknowledge that I was a young parent. While not ideal, there is no shame in that and I love my child.

I want my child moved out of that class and I want it made clear to the principal and the teacher that any further judgement of me or my child will not be acceptable.\"", "NTA.  Super unprofessional of that teacher.  She humiliated your child amd made her an object of ridicule to her classmates.

The composition of your family is nobody\u2019s business except your own unless there\u2019s abuse or broken laws.", "It was not an entire lesson. From what I\u2019ve gathered, it was a worksheet or a bunch of questions she was asking the entire class.

She's 8 and most likely has very little she can do to stand up to a teacher that is willing to bully her. Also at 8 her friendships are still changing and forming all the time. I think it's more important she protect her daughter from the unremorseful teacher.", "This! I was thinking the same thing. Yes, OP should confront the teacher. Yes OP should have spoken to the principle. I understand OP's instinct to want to pull her kid out of the  class but like your comment stated the only person punished would be your  daughter not the teacher. I think OP should talk to her daughter first about what the teacher did and ask her daughter if she wants to switch teachers.", "Thxs for clarifying. One could say almost everything that occurs in a classroom is a teaching moment. In this scenario it was a math problem. The teacher made a conscious decision to use this tool, call on your daughter, & not engage her in a positive manner during a teaching moment. She demeaned your daughter's input while demonstrating to all students that they could be called 'wrong' in front of their peers. Best to you.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but.. what other ways is this teacher shaming students? Kids should love school and learning. School is supposed to be a safe place. it only takes one bad teacher to ruin it for a child. That fact she didn\u2019t even want to speak with her mother is definitely a red flag for me. I would also file a formal bullying complaint with the school district on the teacher", " I agree. Like I said I do think OP should express her concerns about what happened with the teacher and the principal.  Some people mentioned filing a complaint with the school and OP should do that  if she wants, but I don't think this would be considered a fireable offense. Especially if they live in the US. There is a teacher shortage going on and in some states they are lifting restrictions on teaching requirements. So I don't see many school districts letting a teacher go over this situation. Especially if they have been teaching for a long time. I think in the end it won't be what gets the teacher fired or even reprimanded. So the only person that will really be impacted by switching teachers  is OP's daughter. My point was that OP should talk to her daugther first to see if her daughter wants to switch rooms. I'm not saying that OP shouldn't have reported the teacher. I absolutely think she should I just don't have any hopes that it will have the impact OP wants it to have on the teacher.", "I meant to reply to above you didn\u2019t actually see you\u2019re comment until now", " NTA- it\u2019s none of the teacher\u2019s business how old you are and if you are married!

It's literally made no difference in my life or theirs. \n\nSet up another meeting with the principal and the teacher. Ask them if what the teacher said was kind necessary, or helpful. Ask them if that kind of comment would be tolerated from a student. If they agree that it was none of the above, request for your daughter to be put in another class. If they're still fighting you on it after that, report them both to the school board or whoever the next level of authority is.", "NTA.

Well maybe not.  But what the teacher said was completely inappropriate.\n\nIs this school a religious school?", "NTA. Report again and this time tell her if you're not gonna give an appropriate action for this the recording (just a threat) will reach the higher ups and let's see if it's only the teacher who will get a disciplinary action or both of them if you take legal action. \n\nOP i feel bad that your daughter had to hear that.

I cannot imagine asking such a personal question and as to the comment to the rest of the class!! No matter how irregular or unusual the family is, it is not ,nor ever should be, something that a teacher refers to or comments about.  I would not be happy about my child in that class. However, if the Principal does not support your wish to move, just hang in. Will your child move to another class next academic year? If so, just support and love your child, agree that the teacher is an AH, probably say something like \u2018misguided\u2019 and wait for time to pass.

The goody two shoes that I was thought the best course of action would be to bring them to the nurse and ask her to get my mom to pick them up. Well, that didn\u2019t work out well. We went to the hearing and my mom basically said that if they expel me, she was going to the news.\n\nYears later she did end up going above our school boards head later by appearing on the news about zoning. I say this, to say, sometimes you should and need to disrupt the status quo. The public school system (in America) is really on the verge of collapse, it just isn\u2019t viable. And when you have teachers and admin acting this way, it really doesn\u2019t help the situation. \n\nHave a paper trail, send an email to the principal. State that if they don\u2019t address the issue, you will go to the school board. And if they don\u2019t do anything, go to your local news outlet if you can. Good luck.", "How dare they!!! Oh this makes me so mad! You should take it farther up the chain, no way should teachers be treating a child like that! Stand tall for your child", "NTA\n\nLodge a complaint with the school board. That teacher serve principle are out of line.", "NTA!\n\nSue them both!\n\nTheir behavior is unacceptable.", "NTA\u2026you best go to the next school board meeting and raise hell!!!!!!!  I would!!!!!!", "NTA\n\n>She said we aren\u2019t married. Her teacher looked at the class and said \u201cdon\u2019t be like \\_\\_\\_\\_s parents\u201d and everyone laughed\u201d\n\nYeah, you need to go above the principal's head on this one. And make sure to mention you went to the principal first and she thinks you're \"overreacting\". She needs consequences too.", "NTA. What the teacher did is wrong.  I hope you talk to your daughter and support her through this humiliation. That sort of thing stays with you... principal needs to take this more seriously and the teacher needs to face discipline. Go up to the superintendent if you need to.", "NTA", "Definitely nta, and good on you for sticking up for yourself, AND your daughter. How dare that teacher, who is meant to be a positive influence on these young children, behave like that!", "Time to talk to your region's superintendent. Or whatever title the person above the principal has.\n\nNTA. That principal should be ashamed, that teacher should be fired. Shaming students in class is the only school-related thing that I agree with zero tolerance for.", "NTA", "NTA this is one of the few times I firmly believe the admin should be backing you and not the teacher. I hate to say it but it\u2019s time to switch schools. That may seem like a big reaction but honestly this sort of behavior is disgusting and bullying. I\u2019d also be reporting both the teacher and principal to the school board.", "NTA as a former teacher I am appalled by this so called teacher\u2019s conduct. We are Taught what subjects to Not use as lessons. \n\nAges of conception and marriages are Not appropriate in general lessons. And you Never single a pupil out Never.", "Complain to the district. To the superintendant, Keep complaining. Complain to anyone and everyone. Embarrass that Principal. Embarrass that teacher. She is in the wrong Job and needs to be called out.

I don\u2019t have kids, but if I did I wouldn\u2019t want them around that teacher.", "NTA-contact the school board and superintendent immediately", "Very much NTA and your restraint is admirable.", "NTA. Teacher is most definitely an AH and so is the headteacher. Who says that to a child???", "My spouse used to be on the school board so I asked him. He said that if he found out something like that happened in his school, heads would roll.", "NTA. Those actions by that teacher are fucked up. She assumed ages, Humiliated your daughter in front of her whole class (which is a huge deal), and then the principal also thinks it's ok. That teacher is an asshole, and so is the principal.", "Hun I'm 34 and my partner and I aren't married for the singular reason of \"we don't wanna\". \n\nI'd be rolling in there to point out the principal can either handle this or I can add it to the school board docket. This teacher made fun of a student's family to the entire class that is wildly inappropriate. What are they going to do to Foster kids in their classroom. \n\nTo be honest, I think the whole incident that the teacher started was inappropriate. What if one of those kids parents has a really unfortunate story with their birth? That's not an appropriate thing to find out doing basic math at school.", "NTA. Making a child feel like their household isn't normal is a gross thing for a teacher to do. It could have be a good moment on how all families came in different shapes and sizes. Some families have a grandma living at home. Some families have one parent. Some parents can be younger, some can be older. Or some families are none of your business and we aren't announcing things to the class\n\nShe took something that was none of business, broadcast it, and shamed the child in front of her peers", "You are definitely NTA in this situation and I'm so sorry that your daughter had to go through that. Things like this set her up to get bullied in the future.\n\nIf the principal is not going to take you seriously, then I would take it to the Superintendent of the school system. I would also maybe casually mention it to a new station. Don't stop fighting for your child. \ud83e\udd70", "NTA. In some states, it is illegal to delve into personal information. How old you were when pregnant and your marital status qualifies. The humiliation of your child is disgusting behavior. Go back to the principal and tell him/her if your daughter is not moved, or the teacher not disciplined, you're going to file a charge to the school board, board of education (which licences school personnel), etc. Filing won't earn you any brownie points, but the teacher and principal might learn something.", "NTA. Bringing up a child's personal life and information in front of the class is bad enough, but making an example and mocking it... this teacher should be struck off. It's not her place to offer her opinions on her students' parents. \n\nYou made a bit of a mistake about not consulting your husband before seeing the principal though. Two would definitely be better than one in this instance. Go back, with your husband, and say that if nothing is resolved to your satisfaction you will have to escalate it beyond the principal- to the governing body or authority. Remember that principals have to answer to others as well. \n\nYour child should be in a class where she feels safe and not mocked. Your request for her to be moved is entirely reasonable.\n\nEdit: apologies, he is your partner, not your husband, and this is 2023 and that's ABSOLUTELY normal! Damn this archaic fossil of a teacher!", "Reach out to a school board member or the district. What happened to your daughter is NOT ok. I'm very involved in my kids' school and my principal would burst a blood vessel if one of her teachers did something like that. Your kid's administration is letting her down. \n\nNTA.", "Put it all in writing,  send a letter of complaint to the principal AND the school governors/ school board, whatever is superior to the principal.  The teacher stepped way beyond the line. She should not have set that maths problem in the first place, but her continued inappropriate responses to the situation are what you should complain about.  (I am a teacher.)", "**NTA**\n\nNot only that, but let me tell you, my own mother - a deeply traditional, conservative-minded woman - was an elementary teacher for nearly half a century, and if she heard of one of her colleagues shaming a child like this, she would have been SPITTING MAD. Her entire career was devoted to uplifting children, making them feel safe and confident in her class so that they could move forward in their lives in the strongest ways possible. \n\nI will never forget when she had a little girl in her class being raised by a disabled single father, she literally volunteered to DRIVE THE GIRL TO SCHOOL on days the dad wasn't feeling well, to ensure that she never got stuck home. When the child ended up in foster care because the father was too ill to care for her and her siblings anymore, my mum assured her, \"Your house may have changed, but you always have me and my classroom.\" If any other child or adult had tried to embarrass her for her circumstances, my mother would have rained fury down on them. \n\nSchool should be a safe place for children, but so often due to lousy teachers on a power trip it isn't. When I first read the title of this I thought perhaps you were one of those bossy parents who doesn't work well with teachers, and for that I apologise. What was done to your child is unconscionable. Please, go to the administration above the principal. Go to the superintendent if need be. This teacher HUMILIATED your child and made shitty, snide moral judgements about your family openly in front of other children. Your kid doesn't need to be in another class; that teacher needs to be gone. She is not fit to teach. And you are NTA.", "Don't you have to subtract your age and then subtract by 1 again? The human age starts at 0 years old, so by the time a person is 1 year old, it will have been 2 years since they were born. Therefore, if a person is x years old, then it has been x+1 years since they were born. Take the parent's age as y. What the teacher said was that the age the parent had been when their child was born is y-x years. However, it's actually y-(x+1) years. Expand this whole equation and you get y-x-1 years old. All the best for your marriage.", "NTA. Go over the principles head and go to the superintendent. It should NEVER be okay to humiliate and make a kid a joke to the rest of the class. She's projecting her beliefs onto the class.", "NTA and the words you\u2019re looking for to make the principle do their job are \u201cI\u2019m calling my lawyer\u201d. I\u2019ve never see anybody snatch words back so fast as when school admin are threatened with a lawyer.", "NTA and the teacher didn't just embarrass your daughter she embarrassed \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\". This woman should be reported for implicit and explicit bias that is wildly inappropriate for 3rd(?) grade.", "NTA. Teacher should not be making comments like that, especially Infront of the kids", "NTA- I come from a family full of teachers, and work in informal education myself (think camps, after school, field trips, etc). I always come to these posts very ready to defend the teacher, because we get a lot of wild parents with very unrealistic expectations of us, but woah was this teacher incredibly out of line. The math lesson was inappropriate to begin with, but then doubling down and teasing your daughter for her family composition when she has done the math correctly? So incredibly not OK. \n\nAgain, I'm not usually one to advocate for running things up the chain, but if the principal is not taking this seriously either, I'd go to the district or school board next.", "I honestly feel like there is more to this sorry but NTA.", "NTA\n\n18 isn\u2019t ridiculously young to have a child.\n\nAs for being married\u2026I\u2019m not married to my 8 yr olds dad but we\u2019re together.

Making a spectacle of parental age isn't an appropriate learning method. Period!\nThis situation was awful enough but could have potentially been horrendous!\nI sincerely hope someone higher up than the principal realizes this and acts accordingly. \nOP, I'm sorry this happened to your daughter.", "NTA \n\nI HATE these projects so much being a you g mom myself. When people realize I was young and I\u2019m no longer with my kids dad they \u201cbless your heart\u201d me like I\u2019m such a sad case. Fuck that. You seem like a dope parent and I would be burning buildings until someone listened.", "NTA get her a new teacher and fast and if you have to go to the school board she is there to learn not to have her family be belittled", "NTA. From the opposite end of the spectrum, I had my youngest at 40. I really don't need my kids' whole class knowing she's got the \"old mom\". Honestly that's *my personal* information and not for the class, I really don't need to ne part of the lesson plan.", "NTA at all, its really irresponsible for a teacher to make a joke at the expense of a child's family", "Go back and demand a meeting with the principal and said teacher and then start asking your own line of invasive questions.

Does she have children? How old are they? Where they go to school? Where did she go to school? Where she originally from? Where her parents from?

That is wholly unacceptable", "I just can't believe teachers are still doing this kind of shit. Massively upsetting and othering for any kids outside the traditional \"norm\".
