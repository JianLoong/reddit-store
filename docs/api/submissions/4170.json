I was good on time and could\u2019ve let this man ahead. I am a young 20s female \n\nI was a bit annoyed as I had previously been cut in line, ignored, or brushed off and touched without my consent by the men in india (i am a women and Australian) and other cultural things that can happen in a male dominated society.\n\nI was in line for airport security (had been for about 30 min) when a man taps on my shoulder. He had obviously cut the line up to that point. He asked me if he could go in front of me bc he had a flight in 20 min. I told him sorry but no because I also have a close flight. (Mine started boarding in an hour). \n\nHe seemed annoyed and even tried to get me to ask the people in front of me if we could both go ahead of them.\n\nHow I see it is that maybe he should plan better and not get to the airport 20 min before his flight. But I realize I may have been the asshole since I could\u2019ve let him go ahead and kind of took my own irritability and tiredness out on him.\n\nTL;dr AITA for not letting a man skip me in line when he was late for his flight?\n\nEdit: we were not very far from the front when this occurred. Probably ten minutes tops. I\u2019ve been mulling over this and feel bad since usually I\u2019d say yes without hesitation but I had already had a very long day.\n\nBecause it\u2019s been brought up, the man was not Indian. I was annoyed with the way I had been treated by men while in India. Which may have impacted how I reacted.\n\n\nI agree that I was indeed an asshole in this situation. I feel bad about it and will make sure to go out of my way to help others more. I am usually courteous which is why this has been bothering me so much. I wish I could go back and change my actions but I can\u2019t. I know I screwed up and was spiteful for no reason.

You certainly weren\u2019t obligated to though.", "Far too many people in this thread are just assuming the guy was late due to his own poor time management. There are a ton of reasons people could be rushing through security that are due to circumstances out of their control.", "Yes, as a lot of people are saying here he is no entitled to pass in front of you. That being sad, YTA. We can\u2019t know why was he late or if it was a important flight, but why not just let him pass if it doesn\u2019t hurt your own flight? That\u2019s an AH move. It can be you someday.", "YTA it is pretty common to let people whose flights are soon to go first through security. Happens all the time.", "YTA - The way I think of this is, it didn't affect you in a negative way and you could of helped somebody out.\n\nWe don't know the circumstances of him being late, was it an emergency last minute flight? We don't know.\n\nJust be nice.", "NAH\n\nWe don't know the reasons he was running late, but you still aren't obligated to let him in front of you.", "I do not understand why common courtesy is so elusive for so many people. Are you technically correct? Sure. Are you an asshole? Absolutely. Do I hope you miss your next flight due to something out of your control and people treat you without grace or understanding? 100%.", "YTA you had said that he had obviously cut in the line up to that point. How was this obvious? Did you watch him cut or are you assuming he asked others if they would let him through? Cutting the line means just getting into it not asking permission to switch places. He wasn\u2019t cutting. He was being polite. You had every right to refuse him but it was an AH move to refuse because other people cut some other time. You weren\u2019t judging his actions. It would have cost you nothing to be kind.", "YTA. That had nothing to do with gender norms, and more with the fact that he was late for the flight. He'd have to ask the men to let him go first the same as women. Your flight was in an hour, it's not like you couldn't spare him a couple minutes him going first would have cost you.", "While he is not entitled to pass in front of you and you have the right to say no and he should accept it \n\ncuz like Stewie griffin once said \u201c your poor planning does not constitute an emergency for me\u201d\n\nHowever, I can\u2019t help but feel you\u2019re a bit projecting and making him pay for other men\u2019s mistakes.

You\u2019re not exactly avenging yourself here. \n\nas a frequent flyer, i can tell you that sometimes accidents happen and you\u2019re late because traffic or if you take public transport: your train got delayed \nand it really sucks to miss your flight over petty stuff, you could\u2019ve let him pass but you chose not to out of pure spite. \n \nSooo YTA.", "I'm going to say YTA. He actually seems to have requested some leeway from you but you seem to have rejected this request as a form of retaliation for injustices inflicted upon you by other men.", "YTA. You have no clue what made him late. He was not \u201ccutting you in line\u201d like the others were. He asked which is more than anyone else in an airport is willing to do. Also you had ample time to get to TSA and wait for your flight.", "Soft YTA - what do you gain what do you lose? You are allowed to say no, but 100% of the time I asked to cut in the airport is because everything went wrong prior. Car accident, forgot passport, shitty connecting flights, I highly doubt this person was doing this out of entitlement.", "I gotta go with a soft YTA. You had no obligation to help, but it wouldn't have set you back much. You took out your frustration on him, as you stated.", "YTA, I understand you where at a point where you felt very fed up with male entitlement, so much that you perceived this random man as another perpetrator of this. I think this is something you ought to look back on and realize that while your experiences being treated unfairly in Indian as a woman are valid, they also caused you to turn that same behavior on someone else who was in need of your help.\n\nI think that it can be difficult not to become jaded when we experience unfairness. It important to remember that we can speak out against injustice, but we cannot forget to be kind, generous and humble to strangers who deserve the benefit of the doubt about their character.\n\nI think that you can do better in the future for yourself. Don't become a small minded person because of others. Consider your Indian sisters who grow up in that culture, and cannot just board a flight and go home. Remember that your time and energy is not well spent being petty and vindictive.", "YTA, how would you feel if that would have happened to your partner/relative or whatever and they missed their flight bc of people like you.\n\nDoesn't matter if it's maybe his fault that he was late, you don't even know that. Trains can get cancelled, accidents happen on roads, whatever it was, it costs literally nothing to do a stranger a favour.", "YTA. As someone who has almost been late for a flight, most definitely YTA. 10 min away from the front with a flight in 20 could be the difference between narrowly missing it and full on missing it. It's no joke. \n\nAirport staff often call for people whose flight is soon to cut the line way sooner than the last 20 min. Airports are big, he requires time to get to his gate. So many reasons to just let this one person go ahead when you are not in a rush.\n\n\"Planning time better\" sometimes literally doesn't work. Your day may have been long but how do you know what his was like?? If he is running late for his flight, chances are his day has been worse than yours.\n\nI too am a girl in my early 20s btw. Not that it matters ?!?!", "YTA. I was on the other side of a similar story once. I was on time at the airport but the staff gave me a hard time about my pet which I called and get a permission in writing to fly with my pet before even booking the ticket. I was late to my boarding because of their stupidness and selfishness. So yeah, people can be late for many reasons and if the nice people in the line wouldn't let me get through first, I'd miss my flight and be stuck there for hours and lose a lot of money. It doesn't cost you anything to be nice if you have the chance.", "YTA\n\nThis happened to me when the flight I had booked was cancelled and the airline moved me to an earlier flight because I was already at the airport. I asked permission to skip so many times my mouth was completely dry by the time I got to gate.\n\nI get that you have a right to say no. The question isn\u2019t whether you had the right. You are an asshole because you could have helped someone who was in a though spot with no cost to you. \n\nAs if this wasn\u2019t enough, you declined the polite guy because other guys with his skin tone were rude to you. Do you know what that is called? RACISM! Even if you thought you had a legit stereotype, this guy was obviously polite. \n\nHave a happy righteous racist life!", "YTA.  It wouldn\u2019t have harmed you in any way to help out  someone in an emergency, and you wouldn\u2019t have missed your flight.  Besides, after you got through security you would have just been sitting around waiting.", "YTA.\n\nNot because of the cutting line per se but because he wasn\u2019t rude, and you punished him just because others Indians man were rude to you. \n\nThat is ridiculous! Immagine how many Australian women were rude to people you meet in your daily life, do you think everyone make you pay for that?\n\nFor the organisation bit, I lost a flight after leaving home 3h before and it should only have take 1h and half to be at the airport. A tree did fall on a train rails and everything was blocked. You can\u2019t know if something similar happened to him.", "Because you are asking, you know the answer - YTA. A little compassion and kindness goes a long way. In the long run, karma will catch up with you.", "YTA. If a person is gonna miss their flight, you let them go first. It doesn't matter why he was late - there are a million reasons why this could have happened. Usually the staff come and grab people who are going to miss the flight bc they are still queueing. \n\nIt's just common courtesy.", "NTA. Firstly, neither of you know each other's flight plans so you don't know if he is telling you the truth, and he doesn't know if you have 10 minutes until your flight either. Anyone could make something up to cut the line. Secondly, his inability to plan his time management isn't your problem. Everyone knows that you need a minimum of 3 hours before a flight to get to the airport since covid started... his lateness does not make him a priority case. Another point to add- had you agreed to let him go in front of you, you would've been shitting on all the people behind you who also had flights to catch and your \"kind deed\" for one would've inconvenienced many other people.", "NTA, his time isn\u2019t more important than anyone else\u2019s.", "YTA. I\u2019ve been that person a couple times for a variety of reasons. If I don\u2019t have a time crunch too, I let them go first.", "YTA. You had a bad day because other people were discourteous and then you elected to pay it forward. It wouldn't have cost you a thing to be nice and you chose not to because of his race and gender. That's gross when people do it to you but somehow okay for you? Nope.", "NTA, you don't have to let him cut in front of you just because he's running late, you didn't make him late he did that all on his own.", "YTA ofc you're not *obligated* to let him past, as everyone keeps saying, but I do just think its an AH move to refuse to do the nice thing when it costs you basically nothing. It was one guy not a massive group that might make you late for your own flight.", "YTA. It would have cost you nothing to let him go. That said, if I was already annoyed and not in a giving mood, I\u2019d probably do the same thing. It\u2019s okay to not always be your best self. Just own that you\u2019re being an asshole in the moment.", "It sounds like you were a little YTA this time, which is unusual for you in general, but we all behave in sub-optimal ways when we're tired and frustrated. Give yourself a little grace.", "YTA. I am so dang sick of the saying \u2018your lack of preparation does not constitute and emergency on my part\u2019 EVERYONE at some point in time has been in a situation where they just needed a tiny bit of kindness from someone, whether it\u2019s needing to grab one item 1 minute to closing because your kids didn\u2019t tell you something was needed, or there was an accident that led you to being late, or some other fiasco, and goddamnit the world would be a much better place if people could just show a little kindness, especially in situations where it\u2019s nothing. This situation would likely only delay you around 30 seconds to a minute and if he missed his flight he\u2019d be out hours. And for anyone who disagrees, I hope you\u2019re the next person that needs kindness and that you do get it because I\u2019m not a bad person.", "NTA\n\nSuddenly it's every other person's responsibility to make sure this man catches his fight? Where does it end? Why not just ask every person in line how soon their flight is, and whoever's is soonest gets to go to the front? Yes, emergencies happen, but this essentially punishes everyone who is responsible and gets to the airport early in order to maximally convenience whoever is running late.\n\nSometimes you miss a flight. It sucks, but it happens. You catch the next one.", "NTA. Yes you could have been nice and let him through. Just because you could have done something doesn\u2019t mean you have an obligation to do so.", "I'm going to say NTA.  Yes, you could have been *nice* and let him go ahead of you, but he could have also been a responsible adult and made sure he got to the airport in plenty of time.  It's really no secret that you have to allocate plenty of time to get through airports.", "**NTA**\n\nThe saying, \u201cyour emergency isn\u2019t my problem\u201d comes to mind. He should have left an hour or two earlier to get to his flight on time.\n\nP.S. people lie all the time. You don\u2019t know if his flight was in 20 minutes or two hours.", "YTA. I used to fly regularly and was always very early, and I would absolutely let someone in front of me who needed to catch their flight. Why wouldn\u2019t I? I\u2019m not going to get to my destination any more quickly by refusing. \n\nIn Canada security sometimes will even call for people on specific flights departing soon to go to the front.", "NTA. His bad planning isn\u2019t your problem. Although in Mexico the security lets you skip ahead. At least that\u2019s what I have seen happen.", "NTA - him not leaving for the airport in sufficient time to get thru security is not your problem. Plus, there is a very good chance he uses this tactic just to avoid waiting in the security line.", "ESH -   Everyone's the asshole in this situation, but only a little bit. You are allowed to say no, it just would have been kinder to let him past. It wouldn't have hurt you any to help him out if he was running late.  However, once you said no he should have not continued to ask.", "YTA. Were you technically well within your right to refuse? Yes. But what would it cost you to just allow him to pass? Next to nothing. It\u2019s common courtesy.\n\nLots of people here will tell you that you are N T A because you had no obligation. But the question is not Was I obligated but Was I the AH.  And yes, I would totally see you as an asshole if you wouldn\u2019t let someone pass. \n\nAnd btw, why did you refuse? Because he should plan better? Do you know his life and how he planned? No you don\u2019t so don\u2019t make those assumptions. \n\n**So now on to the real issue:** \n\n> I was a bit annoyed as I had previously been cut in line, ignored, or brushed off by Indian men\n\nSeems like this didn\u2019t happen just minutes before the incident but generally in your past right? \n\n> \u2026 when a man taps my shoulder\n\nLet me guess: he was Indian. Interesting that you mention the previous experiences with Indian man but here you don\u2019t mention it\u2026\n\nSo the real question is: would you have let a white man go? We will never know but it doesn\u2019t sound promising. \n\n> I think I may be TA since it wouldn\u2019t have hurt me to let the man go ahead but I was annoyed.\n\nThat settles it for me. You *knew* it wouldn\u2019t hurt you, you didn\u2019t refuse out of principle because you always do, but you were annoyed - annoyed at what? Behavior of other Indian men. Had nothing to do with him personally or his actions.", "NTA - his lack of planning is not your problem. Was he also going to ask every single person ahead of you to cut the line?", "YTA, How do you know he was late due to bad planning and not due to being screwed over by a delay to a connecting flight?", "YTA.\nAnd a bit racist too.", "NTA.  No is a complete sentence.  He needed to plan better.", "NTA,  I know this will be down voted, but what the hell,  cutting in a queue is an AH move the others in the line have been queuing for a while. As for him being late for his flight - you're told get to the airport with plenty of time for all the checks and crap.", "NTA. He was fine to ask, but to push it was an AH move. His lack of planning is not your problem.", "While your not the ah maybe a bit of empathy and in future when your in stretch someone may help you", "Your choice.", "YTA. *THIS* man did nothing to you, and he didn\u2019t \u201ccut\u201d\u2014he asked politely so he could make his flight. You\u2019re just an AH.", "YTA, but you already know that. He asked nicely, it would've literally cost you nothing to let him cut in line, but you had a bad day and took it out on him.", "as someone who travels frequently I'd say YTA, you're not losing anything waiting a few extra minutes but that guy (who did nothing wrong, youre just projecting) would have so much extra shit to deal with if he missed the flight", "YTA because you note that you \"took out your own irritability and tiredness\" on someone who seemed to need help. You had no idea what led to his being late. Maybe it was his fault, but maybe it wasn't. Either way, you just said \"no\" because you were feeling iritable.", "Yta, like many have said, you don't know that it was poor planning. By choosing to *not* be kind, you just risked some bad karma in your next travles.", "YTA \nWhile you're obviously in your rights to say no, it wouldn't have harmed you if you showed some common courtesy n let him go ahead. N he might have planned everything well but sometimes, things do not go as planned. He might have had to book that flight urgently, or might have got stuck in traffic (as an Indian, I can say that traffic in most big cities is unpredictable). And as a frequent traveller, it's very common for people to ask n go forward in such queues when getting late for a flight. Sometimes, even the security helps such people go forward by calling them forward.", "YTA it doesn\u2019t cost you anything to be kind to a stranger", "YTA look I would feel exactly the way you did. But fuck I\u2019ve also been late in a security line for my flight and vividly remember the sick guilty feeling of having to ask for people to help me. I also remember how utterly grateful I was  to the people who helped me. Did you have to? No of course not. Should he have planned better? Yes. But I can\u2019t think of you of anything but an asshole (In this circumstance!) \n\nBut I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna have a lot of different responses on this one.", "It would have had a negligible impact on your travel to help this guy out. And by your phrasing, I get the sense you\u2019d have responded differently had it been a woman asking for help.

When that happens, remember this. \n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nDoesn't matter the reason, he asked and you said no.

Obviously you didn't need to let him go in front of you but that doesn't mean your not being an asshole.", "I don't get all the N T A, responses.  I definitely think YTA.  A friend and I were on our way home from Disney and had been standing in the security line for almost an hour.  A young gentlemen was about to miss his flight, everyone in that line (people behind and in front of us) were trying to get that man to the front to get through first.  Not sure if he made his flight, but he made it through that line in!", "NAH\n\nHe isn't an A for asking, you aren't technically an A for refusing but I do side with him here. Airports and travel are stressful, we all have low days where we are late or things get crazy so having some consideration for others in those circumstances is the kind thing to do. I'd rather be the kind person and let him through then be the cold but not wrong person who didn't.", "NTA.

But the airline didn't have a kiosks so I had to wait in line where the service desks were refusing to open more than one line at a time. It took me and an hour and a half to get a new ticket.

But if you want to focus on OP behavior, let me respond.\n\nIt wasn't a mistake. She made a choice. She decided her needs were greater than his needs regardless of how little hers were in that moment and how great his needs were. She did this because she deemed him as unworthy based on some sexist and frankly racist assumptions. Because she had a bad week, everyone else had to suffer for it.\n\nYou are letting her off the hook because you don't expect people to be considerate of others unless they are technically obligated to be. For you, if she let him by, that would have been nice. But not letting him by is fine because you have set such a low bar for kindness that you don't expect that it should be standard behavior.

Another maze and finally made it to my gate to board (and the flight itself was 10 minutes late).

They had already closed out the flight when the attendant pushing my wheelchair explained that I had JUST deboarded from another flight that was late.
