Yes, your uncle can have done it for shady reasons and it's better if you contact an attorney. \nBut also: many does it when they have an affair or whatever they don't want to show to their wife.

Keep acting like this", "NTA - go tell this story t the police.   You may need a tax attorney.   Since your name is on the account, you would be responsible for any tax liability.   It is quite common for accounts to be opened in a minor's name to move money through it.  Not saying he's done that, but you need to get yourself protected in this.", "NTA in the slightest. Sounds like your uncle may have been using that account to move funds around in a VERY shady manner. Keep those records you found OP, right up until you closed it! And I would send a single message to your uncle telling him, point-blank, you have a right to close an account that you (a) were told was closed years ago (b) have never been given access to (c) did NOT give him permission to use in your name for WHATEVER it is he's up to.\n\nIf you fear retaliation or violence, take the steps to protect yourself. Check and see if this could count as identity fraud perhaps? \n\nETA: also check your credit and lock it down IMMEDIATELY. If he's using your name and identity to do something shady, who the hell knows what else he's done with your personal info?", "I can only think of one logical explanation which is he was using the account in your name to launder money. \n\nBe super careful OP and stay out of his way. This is good advice to run a credit check too for both you and your sister.", "Google Axton BetzHamilton. She specialises in financial crimes/credit fraud within families and what to do about it.  She also wrote a very good book about her own experience The Less People Know About Us", "Yes. Definitely one of the above. Either way it's risking OP.

Good point about not letting him know her new bank!\n\nOh, then I suggest a quarter and a dime scotch taped to a piece of cardboard inside a small manilla envelope.

Here is your 35 cents. Now kindly F off.

Sorry. \ud83d\ude04", "NTA He was doing something suspicious and next thing you should do is check your credit report. If he used your identity for anything or starts threatening you, call the police.", "NTA I smell some tax fraud here", "NTa... closing it was smart. Get your sister to do the same. Then look into protecting your SSN. Might want to do a credit check to see if there is any loans or credit cards out in your name.", "NTA.\n\nMoney. Laundering.\n\nThough I find it odd that you were able to close a joint account without the consent of the other party.", "NTA have your sister look into her account also I would contact a lawyer. There is something very odd about this who thing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe was using your name for some shady deals. You were right to get out of that fast.", "Please post this situation in r/legaladvice\n\nJust the banking/credit information,  not the interpersonal or emotional parts and  please include your state/province. \n\nYour uncle has been doing shady shit and you should consult a lawyer.  Many tax attorneys offer a free consultation so it may not cost you an arm & a leg to get an idea of your exposure.", "NTA.  He had no right to use your ss and create an account to do what appears to be money laundering. Not only is it morally wrong, but it is also illegal. Print out your statements and then get your sister to request statements from her account because you might find the transfers go between them.  \n\nHe may be depositing cash in one, transferring it to the other account,  and then moving it into his account or yet a third  account.  Whatever it is,  you need to know because you can get into legal trouble if the bank (or fbi or police) thinks you are aware of the transfers. It can also mean your ability to open accounts in the future can be compromised.   \n\nYou did the only thing you could do.", "My guess is money laundering and he is using this and the sister's account to do it.   OP might discover more accounts in other banks.  \nWhat a crappy thing to do to a kid.", "You don't have to have you name on an account if you don't want to be on that account.  As long as it isn't in the red, that is.", "Of course that's what he did.  What else would it be?", "Money order. Probably cost more to get one than the amount to pay him off though.", "I find it strange that you were not allowed to remove yourself from the account, but were allowed to close a joint account. Typically, you would be able to remove yourself from a joint account in good standing, but not allowed to close it altogether.", "NTA sounds like he was laundering money through your accounts get your sister to close hers too", "NTA -I realize my response is late, but as a former banker of 35 years, you need to file a report with BofA fraud department. Ask that the Fraud Department provide you copies of all transactions on this account for the past 3-5 years. Tell them that none of these transactions were originated by you. Depending on their findings, you may need to take legal/criminal action against your uncle to protect yourself. \n\nAs others have said, your uncle is shady as hell. Something is really, really fishy. Good luck!", "He's laundering money or something else illegal. I'd be going back to talk to the bank manager and alert them to the situation, and possibly talk to the police.

If you can\u2019t afford legal advice, try the IRS Taxpayer Advocate.", "And freeze your credit.", "I agree with you fully. I would only add to go to the police immediately. Not to file a report immediately but to make them aware of the situation while you figure things out. As someone else has stated it might be used to launder money or other illegal activities. Especially with the reaction of the uncle I am sure there is no good legal explanation why he had these accounts. Also, if OP is already afraid of him and what he might do because of anger issues there is already a threat for OPs safety and her sister\u2019s safety as well.", "I would also suggest getting wage and income transcripts from 2018-2022 (2023 is not yet available) from the IRS to see if you were issued any tax statements from the bank. Since your uncle knows your SSN I would look into getting an Identity Protection Person Identification Number (IP PIN) from the IRS, you can opt into the program online. \n\nYou can input a fraud alert on your credit for free by contacting one of the 3 credit bureaus. Experian 888-397-3742, TransUnion 888-909-8872, Equifax 800-685-1111. You only need to contact one, which ever one you choose will contact the other two.", "Yeah, my first thought was money laundering too, but I\u2019m side eying this a little. \n\nIf there are \u201cconsiderable amounts\u201d being transferred in and out frequently how has this not triggered a suspicious activity report? Maybe smaller banks wouldn\u2019t have a strongly developed BSA program, but BOA absolutely would have. \n\nThat being said, it is possible that what OP considers considerable is significantly below the reporting threshold.", "Having a mistress isn't illegal. I'd rather OP go to an attorney first before saying something innocent and innocuous-aeeming that can be used by the uncle to discredit her. She's inexperienced and has a lot on her plate.\nA tax attorney isn't cheap -- $60 for a half hour here, so the cost of $120 or so may seem quite high but can save her future. \n\nThe attorney is legally bound to have your interest in mind first and foremost, whereas the police will likely take a report and do nothing (in most places I've lived in). They have other priorities. If an attorney makes that report they do their job.", "People still send checks when they need a paper trail.", "I work in a bank, and our BSA program only files currency transaction reports if there's more than $10,000 worth of cash transactions in a day. If it's electronic transfers, our system isn't triggered. I'm not in our compliance department, so I'm not sure what exactly would trigger a suspicious activity report, but they may be building evidence against him to get him removed as a member. We were taught to file SAR's if someone is fishy in branch, so if he's doing this in branch and it seems normal, they may not even realize what's going on.", "BofA has that and additional mechanisms in place.    Former employee.", "No worries. I\u2019m an old fart at heart and I know it \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. the only big thing i can think is does your uncle still have access to your SSN. if so, it might be worth looking into getting a new one. or at least signing up for something like LifeLock that will tell you if your info is used without your approval", "NTA. I'd get over to experian and check your credit report. Who knows what else he's done in your name. Then I'd freeze your credit so he can't pull any more stunts like this.", "That's why I recommended a tax attorney. It's not an easy task for a stressed out college student...", "While the police will indeed do almost nothing beyond the report, the report would be the start of a paper trail (and yes, a lawyer could begin that process as well) of documentation that they can point to further down the line should anything more happen.", "I think we can both agree that OP needs to take a legal route to protect herself. I'm not an attorney, if you are one I would urge her to heed your advice over mine. I just think an attorney will know the right thing to do better than you or me.", "Yeah, NTA. This situation is extremely shady. Your uncle is a violent man. Contact an attorney, but also tell your mum and dad immediately. Your uncle is up to something with your identity and it\u2019s likely not good. Stay safe.", "NTA, go to your parents. I bet they didn't have a clue about this. I think a conversation with b of a's fraud department would be the correct action (with your sister). And please, please check your credit history (and your sisters).", "This terrible advice. Walking into the police station and saying \u201cI may have been involved in a money laundering scheme\u201d is a great way to end up as the one in the dock.", "My first thought was that he has a mistress or criminal enterprise that he wants to keep off his own accounts. Whatever it is, it's pretty skeevy.", "That\u2019s not the advice I gave though. The advice I gave is telling them someone is using a bank account connected to their personal information like social security number without their knowledge. So if something fishy is going on with that bank account they are going to look at her.\n\nETA: in my country banks are obligated to check these with all bank accounts with them because of criminal activities. Banks got fined a few hundred millions of euros for not doing this to the extend they are supposed to under a new law. So they do it now. I have seen people in my criminal justice system who let others use their bank accounts and they got jailtime for it. Sometimes people told the judges they didn\u2019t know about it, but if it\u2019s connected to your social security number then you are probably going to be held responsible unless you can make clear you literally didn\u2019t know anything about it.", "Or a cashier\u2019s check. At least then the transaction would be tracked."]}
