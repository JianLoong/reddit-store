They invite me to bday parties and I come when I can, even if husband doesn\u2019t come bc of work. \n\nSo this night, against my husbands wishes lol I go pick up the food. MIL is the best cook I know and she loves cooking for her family.\n\nMy husbands sister used to be one of my closest friends. During the time of my wedding, she and my other MOH were the ones I would confide in about my stresses regarding the wedding.\n\nThen I get a phone call from my other MOH to stop telling SIL-MOH things because she keeps bringing up my business for no reason during their conversations while she (friend-MOH) is just trying to help plan for the wedding events. She said it\u2019s super weird because that\u2019s all SIL-MOH wants to do is basically gossip abt me. \n\nMy MIL& fam is fake AF, all they do is talk mad shit abt my other SIL who\u2019s married into the family, but they kiss her ass when she\u2019s around. I think they may be jealous of her, and I\u2019m not convinced they don\u2019t talk about me exactly like that when I\u2019m not around, even though I kinda know they do because I walked in on them once talking bad about me at a family event. \n\nFF back to the original story, I came to pick up the food per my MIL request and her younger daughter (4 yrs younger than me) said I don\u2019t come around, only time I come around is to get food. MIL agreed. I asked her when was the last time she came to my house. she started stuttering saying my dogs gonna \u201ceat\u201d her baby bc they\u2019re so big. I said don\u2019t try to make up an excuse, my dogs are v well trained (she knows this) and the younger dog is still being potty trained so she\u2019s on a crate sched.\n\nThey don\u2019t text me to come over and hang out , MIL ONLY texts me to come pick up food when she cooks. Honestly I don\u2019t really have the desire to hang out with them more than I have been. I don\u2019t have much free time and I\u2019m more of a loner type of person and have many responsibilities. \n\nAlso if they wanted to hang out with me more, there\u2019s definitely a better way they could\u2019ve said it rather than insinuating I\u2019m leeching off them considering that lately, 80% of the time my MIL cooks for us I help pay for the food she\u2019s cooking even though we end up getting like 1/6 of the food cooked bc our house isn\u2019t comprised of nearly as many people as hers. She didn\u2019t ask for us to help pay but it\u2019s just the considerate thing to do.\n\nSo I\u2019m not planning to pick up any more food from them. I feel as though the communication could\u2019ve been a lot more respectful & I\u2019m tired of pretending they\u2019re not getting on my nerves at this point.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1669214950, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2r19f/aita_for_not_prioritizing_mils_wishes_anymore/", "score": 231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why stress yourself out for a chaotic mess?", "NTA for not wanting to pick up food you didn't ask for.  However you do need to inform MIL to no longer cook food for you and give a reason.", "NTA, that's definitely rude of them. I'd like to know more about how picking up the food was against your husband's wishes? Why doesn't he pick it up anyway?", "NTA what took you so long?", "NTA.", "NTA - so many things going on here but at the core issue you're in the right.", "NTA. I strongly urge you to go no contact.", "NTA.  Gossiping and bad mouthing you behind your back was an excellent way for your in-laws to destroy their relationship with you.  I think you\u2019re 100% justified in distancing yourself.  Tell everyone that you want your husband to coordinate future food pick-ups and visits.", "NTA - but you need to make some changes in your approach.  You are the wife of her son,brother.  You are not a bonus daughter or bonus sister.  They are not your bonus mom or sister.  Your relationship is with your husband.  If your husband were suddenly not in the picture tomorrow, you would not have a relationship with them because your relationship is through your husband.\n\nWhen you get engaged and get married, there is this talk of joining the family, etc.  that\u2019s not the way it works.  You aren\u2019t joining his family and he isn\u2019t joining your family, you and he are creating your own little family unit.  His family is his family of origin, your family is your family of origin.  In your new little family unit of yourself and your husband, you discuss and decide on everything together.  You provide insight to your family, and he provides insight to his family.  You didn\u2019t grow up in his family, so you didn\u2019t live his history, you don\u2019t get the subtle things they do, because you didn\u2019t grow up with them. It\u2019s the same for him with your family.  So, when he says don\u2019t go to his mother\u2019s, you don\u2019t go, because you are the wife of her son, you are not her bonus daughter.  When you say to him, that\u2019s not a good idea for my family, he should listen to you, because you will always know your family better than he does because you spent years growing up in your family.\n\nYou are not an equal to your husband in his family.  You can\u2019t be because you are his wife.  You don\u2019t share their dna, you didn\u2019t spend years growing up in his household, his mother didn\u2019t give birth to you.  He is not an equal in your family for the same reasons.  He is the husband of their daughter\u2026. If you and he ever have trouble or a disagreement or whatever, his family will side with him no matter how wrong he is, and your family will side with you no matter how wrong you are.  Because your mother gave birth to you and she will always be on your side.  His mother gave birth to him, she will always be on his side.\n\nWhen you marry and form your own little family unit, you both leave your families of origin.  It\u2019s wonderful for you and your husband because you are starting a new adventure of building your lives together.  Your families of origin now have a hole where your husband or you used to be.  Your husband isn\u2019t going to dinner at his mothers 5 times a week, he isn\u2019t calling her for advice\u2026 he isn\u2019t calling his sister for advice, because he has you.  You are cooking dinner, or you are cooking dinner together, he is looking to you for advice.  That\u2019s the circle of life, that\u2019s how it is supposed to be.  Little birds grow up, spread their wings and fly away to find a mate and build their own new nest.\n\nYour MIL is desperately trying to hang on to her son, so she makes dinners for you and your husband as a way to get you to come to her house to visit.  They invite you to things, you go even if your husband is busy.  no no no\u2026 you and your husband decide together what you can attend, and you never attend his family gathering without him, and he never attends your family gatherings without you.  You and your husband are not two single people.  You are a couple.  You are each half of the couple.  You attend things together or you don\u2019t attend.  You are not equals when it comes to his family or your family.  You go as a couple.  If one of you can\u2019t go, then neither of you go, and the one who isn\u2019t busy goes off with your own friends or something.\n\nThe reason you never go to his family stuff alone and he doesn\u2019t go to yours alone, is you can\u2019t handle them and he can\u2019t handle yours.  They are doing this to isolate you and brow beat you into doing what they want, and you don\u2019t have your protector, your husband with you. \n\nYour role as his wife and his role as your husband is to be polite and engage in small talk when in the presence of the spouse\u2019s family, and the. Follow the lead of the spouse with his family.  You don\u2019t override what he thinks is best for dealing with his family, and he doesn\u2019t override what you think is best for your family.  That\u2019s because you don\u2019t know them and he doesn\u2019t know yours.  You are an expert in your family and he is an expert in his family.\n\nWhen try to treat his family,like your own family, you will get burned, same with him.  If you need to talk about issues, you never ever go to his family,  not his mother, not his sister.  You go to your friends who are your friends outside of your relationship with your husband.  It\u2019s the same for him, whe he wants to talk about stuff he goes to his friends,  not your family.\n\nYou and your husband need to discuss how much you as a couple want to interact with families.  That\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be much like maybe once a month, because yo are a newly married couple, you have work, house chores, adventures, activities, hobbies, outings with friends, building your life together, doing things together as a couple, there is very little time for your families of origin.  That\u2019s the circle of life.  If you and your husband decide that you don\u2019t want his mother cooking extra for you guys, then he needs to step up and tell his mom.  Mom, OP and I appreciate that you want to make us dinner, but we are adults, and we want to make our own dinners, we are married and enjoying this married life thing.  We are happy to come visit you once a month or biweekly (whatever you and your husband want), but please don\u2019t spend time making extra food for us.  We have other plans and then you get upset when we don\u2019t pick it up.  Mom, I love you, but I a, not 10 yrs old living at home, I am not the 20 yr old living on my own not knowing how to cook.  OP and I are adults and married and we are doing this cooking thing together.  Mom, this isn\u2019t about you, it\u2019s about us,  it\u2019s the circle of life.  You are a spectator in the stands cheering us on, while we are on the field playing the game of life. Mom, you have your own game of life, but it doesn\u2019t include me anymore now that I am married.  I will happily come see you once a month to cheer you on.\n\nHope this helps.", "NTA but your husband is. He's the one who should be doing food pickups.

For example, he could pick up food after work.\n\nThe most Basic Couple Rule: you manage your own side of the family. You know them best, how they're going to react, what you should do to grow/keep a positive relationship. It's not fair to you that he's made managing his mother your responsibility.\n\nI don't care if you have more time on your hands. It's Basic Couple Rule.

Explain that it has made you feel like you are taking advantage of them when SIL said something about it. I bet they talk behind your back too.

It is okay not to prioritize MIL's wishes, when she clearly doesn't bother with what you may need or want.

I shut them down early in my marriage and my husband (God Bless him!) loves his family very much, but he doesn't deny their bad actions/habits.  He does ask me to tolerate them sometimes.   Lucky for me we moved across the country and rarely see them.  \n\nMy MIL used to cook food and she brought it over.  If husband wasn't there, she would leave the food on the stoop.  I started to see it wasn't a one-time thing and that she was avoiding me.  So I figured if she couldn't even knock on the door and say a brief hello, then I would ignore the food.  So, I would cook my family's dinner and when hubby came home in the evening and brought in the food on the porch I would say, I am so sorry that delicious dish was left out all day.\n\n I would call MIL, thank her for the effort but as I didn't know it was out there all day it has gone bad and I would return the dishes the next day.
