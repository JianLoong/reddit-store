He is now clearly aware that you were right, his girlfriend is right, her parents are right and he is so very wrong.  Honestly, I don\u2019t know how he can come back from that in this relationship.  I bet GF is mortified.  GF parents now have a low low opinion of him.  Perhaps he will recognize how bad this is and correct it, in this relationship or the next.

The purpose of good manners is to respect each other, and unfortunately, because your wife prevented your son from ever learning good manners, he has now disrespected his girlfriend and her parents.  The girlfriend is not overreacting at all.\n\nIt just does not compute in my mind why your wife would want to prevent your son from learning such an important life skill which has put him at quite a disadvantage and set him up for a lifetime of situations like this if he doesn\u2019t now as an adult understand the importance of it, and learn how to do it on his own.

It\u2019s probably China that originated the pervasive myth about complimentary burping abroad.\n\nSometimes, this rule is conflated with a Japanese one that has to do with slurping. At restaurants in Japan, it\u2019s considered proper to slurp noodles while eating. However, it is not polite in Japan to burp, nor is it polite in China to slurp. It\u2019s probably for the best that you keep these two rules straight in your head.\n\n**Parts Of India**\n\nIn India, the topic of burping seems to be a little bit more contentious. Some Indian bloggers say that burping during a meal is just part of the normal process, and nobody will mind. Others disagree, and there\u2019s at least one heated debate over the etiquette on Quora.\n\nBecause burping is associated with being improper, it can be offensive to imply that everyone in the country openly burps. But like China, there are certain states of India where burping can be a compliment. It\u2019s probably best to follow the advice of journalist Petrina Verma Sarkar, and only belch when you\u2019re very familiar with the local culture and people.\n\n**Bahrain (Maybe)**\n\nBahrain is a small island in the Middle East, just to the east of Saudi Arabia.

Spare no expense on the soda.", "I think they subconsciously don\u2019t want their sons to date so that they can baby them and another woman doesn\u2019t \u201ctake him away\u201d so to speak", "Yeah, the situation is very fucking weird. The mom has set her son up for failure.", "Son will soon become convinced the entire world is full of overreacting women. Hope he likes being single.", "I know someone who was in their mid 20s and did this, only stopped cos people gossiped about it behind his back and he got self conscious about it finally.", "I WAS IMAGINING A FUCKING TWEEN NOT A 22 YEAR OLD. Omg nta \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "HOLY CRAP.\n\nYour wife is a coddling blinded mommy of a little boy.  that isn't a little boy.\n\nTell your wife the entire freaking internet of strangers is laughing with you that your son got to learn the hard way after ignoring you for probably a decade.", "Home alone.", "> That's one shit mum. What other behaviours has she tolerated?\n\nI'd hazard a guess that she has said \"boys will be boys\" more times than OP can count.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. Once I hit my mid-twenties I realized that moms like this were deal breakers and red flags. You marry/date your partners families too sometimes and when her baby boy can do no wrong it\u2019s an instant RUN", "I feel like the son is one of those guys who doesn't know how to wipe properly.", "You know you can burp subtly, right? Like if you don\u2019t open your mouth it won\u2019t make noise\u2026 like I don\u2019t think the burping is the problem per se, it\u2019s burping loudly, no?", "> Good for everyone really but especially people spending time in distinct cultures.\n\nHe is getting there. He is a home sick teen. I suspect he is being stubborn on this issue as a way to hold onto something from his home.", "Sounds like a good way for me to become the \"evil\" stepfather. I'll help and advise him and try to teach him. But I wont force him. He will learn the lesson eventually and I will be there to help if he lets me.", "That sounds absolutely horrific. Immigrants get a pass since they are learning. I would absolutely lose my shit on an American eating that way in the US.", "In times like this, the father should model a graceful approach and a thorough explanation of what happened. Not to laugh in his face when he is in emotional distress. I mean, I get it, but its kinda not cool no matter the son's age.\n\nBut a son's father is one of the rare sources of unconditional empathy that a son should expect in times of struggle, even if its a silly struggle to some.", "I came here to find this comment. Infantilizing behavior my a mother to her adult son is absolutely repellant to potential partners. Barf.", "Nah. She\u2019s not going to mother him. If he continues this she will just dump him.", "Imagine dating a grown ass man and having to teach him how to eat. \n\nAs always, I\u2019m shocked at the awful quality of people that folks will choose to date.", "NTA what did he do for an encore- armpit fart the national anthem? crush a beer can on his forehead?", "Prime example of why the cat lady epidemic is only getting worse lmao", "We can tell the son himself, he'll be somewhere on Reddit complaining about women having too high standards for sure lmao", "I am trying to imagine this barnyard animal doing that during a business lunch. That\u2019ll put him on the fast track. /s", "I work with WOMEN who are like this. The one sits and burbs all day and the one next to her sucks up snot all day. Like worse than any man I know. I grew up with two older brothers and have been around guys my whole, not girls, and they're not even close to as bad as these girls. Oh, and the one next to me has a weak pelvic floor, doesn't wear depends, and urinates on her seat. I've seen her jump up for the bathroom leaving a puddle in her chair, which is soaked up by the fabric. She walks in smelling like urine. She left, thankfully, and the managers let someone else sit in her urine soaked chair vs throwing that biohazard out.", "I stopped doing this shit at... 12? Earlier?", "I worked with a woman in her early 50's who eats with her mouth open. When I was in the same department as her and we had to attend a group lunch, I developed a system where I would pace myself as we walked toward the table in the restaurant to ensure that I always sat on the same side of the table, with at least one person (preferably two) between us. This made sure I did not ever have to look at her, or hear her, while eating. \n\nHowever, she would often pass the time between the mains and the dessert by picking her teeth at the table with a metal tooth pick she kept in her handbag. Just whip it out, open her mouth and dig around, while conversing with people. No shame at all. It was bad. \n\nShe also loved to eat lunch during zoom calls throughout the pandemic. It got to the point where I had to switch to tile view so I could stick a postit over her tile to prevent being unexpectedly confronted with the sight of her talking with food rolling around in her mouth. There were routinely raised eyebrows, but this woman didn't take hints so never connected the dots.", "The mother shunned her responsibilities. My son had better table manners at age 5 than this 22-year-old. Shame on the Mom who\u2019s definitely TA", "OP says it's all mom's fault. What's *he* been doing all these years? \n\nGuess they never took the little heathen out in public and taught him how to behave. Parenting by osmosis, right?", "I mean they are pretty hilarious but there's a time and place for them. Or rather many times and places not for them", "I could let my kid go anywhere by the time she was 8-10. \n\nShe's turning 40 and also thanked me for teaching her manners. \n\nToddlers always sit next to me at a restaurant because I can teach them how to behave and use utensils. I'm female and a proponent of good table manners. I whisper to my charges.\n\nWhat's OP been doing all these years? Taking his heathen out in public and blaming mom? \"Not my fault!\"\n\nI'm definitely an old curmudgeon! I wonder how OP's kid ever got through a first date.", "And if you aren't sure which bread plate and water glass is yours, make an OK with both hands. The one that looks like a \"b\" is the bread side. The one that looks like a \"d\" is the drink side", "and the poop knife reappears", "Hints like that one always confused my mom because she could never remember if the hands should be palms facing her or facing away. Both felt equally natural.", "I ran EMS with a dude who was the MESSIEST eater of all time. Being in a truck with him, you had to dodge flying food, SOMEHOW, one time while eating a salad, he got ranch UNDER his ballcap hat. HOW?!", "Oh god, I had a coworker like that, I have pretty severe misophonia and it took every ounce of my strength to not take a run at her in the lunchroom.  She also had braces, and all the food would get gunked up in them, which, I had braces, I get it, but because she ate with her mouth open and lips pulled back like a donkey it was all visible all the time.  Just filth.", "MAXIMUM MASTICATION", "Is he Asian by chance? I learned from the family I worked for in their culture to not make any noise while eating is an insult to the chef (they were Vietnamese) my jaw hit the table the first time I ate with everyone and before I could even say anything it was explained to me and I was like oh.. and realized how much things differ between regions.", "Is he mentally disabled?.what's \"that's how he.is\" mean?", "I think it's likely she's talked to him about it multiple times already. Probably even asked him to stop doing that every time. And just like with OP, he conveniently \"forgets.\" And she's probably been getting more and more annoyed by it. \n\nBut now he's humiliated her in front of her parents, and her finally snapping over it might very well have been the straw that broke the camel's back for her. \n\nI honestly won't be surprised if OP comes back with an update to say his girlfriend dumped him a day or two later.", "Well at least this one seems to have put her foot down.", "I wonder if that's misophonia. I have a lot of trouble with people chewing (smacking) when they eat. I had a significant other once who would gulp water and food, but no open mouthed chewing. I won't say relations ended over that, but it contributed.", "People say that, but I've got a lot of Asian friends from different countries, including Vietnam, both first generation, and FOB, and none of them are really noisy or rude eaters.  I feel like people just use that as an excuse when an individual or family has bad manners.  Like, slurping noodles  or bringing your rice bowl up to your face is one thing, but full on open mouth noisy chewing?  I don't buy it.", "literally no other choice.", "Are there no mangers there?"]}
