I recently moved to the area my boyfriend grew up in. I do not have a doctor here yet. My boyfriend and his mom are away visiting family across the country. \n\nI am very close with his mom and have also gotten close with her best friend (F ~45) who is currently living temporarily with her locally and is an ER doctor here. \n\nOn Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls, I was debating going to the ER for testing / ultrasound (not ideal obviously but I needed to see a specialist asap). \n\nFor quick context on why I had to react quickly, I had an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago that resulted in sudden internal bleeding and a near death emergency surgery. I am very high risk for another one.\n\nSo, after discussing with my boyfriend and taking his advice, I called the friend of his mom who was home and off-duty.\n\nI explained my situation very directly and calmly and asked for her direction. \n\nShe told me to not rush to an ER and gave a referral for the next day. I expressed how appreciative I was. She said call if anything came up that evening, and the conversation ended amicably. \n\nFast forward 3 days. I receive a text at 12am from her. Here it is with some redactions for privacy:\n\n\u201cI feel that it is necessary that I make you aware of a few things. I feel that it was wholly inappropriate that you involve me in your personal drama.\n\nX (boyfriend\u2019s mom) is my best friend. I was placed in a no win situation by a person who clearly doesn\u2019t understand boundaries. A person who relies on the fact that people are kind and accommodating even when their personal comfort is compromised. The sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act is just that\u2014 an act. \n\nWhat I see is a subversive manipulative sociopathic person who had to go out of her way to ruin X\u2019s vacation. And you used me to do it. Because you clearly have issues with boundaries I\u2019m going to make this crystal clear. I am not interested in any further interaction with you. The Dr (her last name) free clinic is closed  You have crossed a line and I do not want to be saddled with your issues medical or otherwise. There is no need to respond to this text.\u201d\n\nWhile calling her was a difficult choice and my last resort, the more I\u2019ve sat on the text message, the more I\u2019ve started to think I am the asshole for not considering further the position I was putting her in. I can see how she felt I overstepped given her friendship with X. I spoke with X on my own on Friday, but that\u2019s irrelevant here.\n\nOn the other hand, I can\u2019t shake that - especially as a medical professional - she reduced my health concerns I shared with her over a risky pregnancy to drama in a 12am text. I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone. \n\nAITA for involving someone - who I now very clearly know didn\u2019t want to be involved - in my pregnancy situation?\n\nClarification edit: our phone call was at 5pm, not 12am. 12am was when I received the text message 3 nights later.", "created_utc": 1683533823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bicmc/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_moms_best_friend/", "score": 625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cause there is no world where a doctor would react like that if a high risk patient just asks for a medical advice?", "INFO Based on what's written here, I'm inclined towards N T A. But I can't help but feel something is missing. While a doctor may not like giving out advice while not in duty, that reaction, especially the personal verbal attack, is over the top. Either relevant context is missing  and the doctor did a good job at hiding how she felt over the phone, only expressing herself a few days later, or something happened in the 3 days after related to OP that changes how the doctor  thought.  Without knowing why I'm not comfortable giving judgment.", "I feel like there is a HUGE chunk of information missing here.", "There seems to be some info missing here. I understand that you did a test and found out you were pregnant. And that you know that you\u2019re at high-risk for a second ectopic pregnancy. But I don\u2019t understand who the \u201ccountless unanswered calls\u201d were placed to or why? Or what symptoms you were having that caused you to \u201cneed a specialist asap\u201d? And the level of hostility in the doctor\u2019s message suggests that she believes you to be, at minimum, a manipulative person. \n\nBottom Line: If you were cramping, bleeding, or in pain, then you should have called an ambulance and gone to the ER immediately. \nIf you were not having any symptoms, but were fearful because of your last pregnancy, then you needed to do something to calm down- call your bf, call a friend and talk to them. Neither of these required you to call a doctor you did not know for advice. ESH. \n\nEdits: clarity.", "I\u2019m getting the feeling something else happened. Did you harass the doctor? This is not something someone would send from 1 concerned phone call.", "YTA. you didnt ask for advice, you asked for a referral. Totally different and you're burying the lede. She's right to text you setting a firm boundary, you basically used your relationship with her to get her to work for free because you didnt want to listen to the advice youd already been given by ER", "YTA.\n\n'Emergency department just told me to come into the emergency department. Which I was hoping to avoid by making an appointment for Friday with an Obgyn.\n\nI asked the friend for a big favor/help referring me to an Obgyn that could see me before the weekend.'\n\nYou didn't call her for advice; you called for a favour because you wanted a referral. You didn't want to follow ERs advice. That did put her in an uncomfortable position; to her credit, she helped you, but I can absolutely see why she feels her boundaries were stomped over here. I think her text to you was spot on and you do need to reflect on this behaviour. I wouldn't even phone one of my best friends asking them to do something like this for me.", "ESH, with qualifiers. Medical people work hard enough without being consulted by every acquaintance. I can understand them having firm boundaries, and I can understand people pushing those boundaries in emergencies.\n\nSo I was kinda leaving towards you being slightly socially the A, in an understandable, sometimes-you-gotta-be-the-asshole kind of way. But, unless you've left out a bunch of drama, the message you received is pretty unnecessarily vicious. I guess she was just lashing out because she didn't feel able to say no at the time. I'd shrug your shoulders and just leave it.", "YTA. per the comments, you had already decided not to go to the ER and wanted a referral stat, so decided to pull a 'friend' card to get that. I can understand why you did it in prioritizing yourself and your health, but not sure why you're surprised about the off-duty doctor acquaintance feeling inappropriately used. i mean, maybe its her fault too for not just saying 'sorry, can't help' immediately when you called, since this is def worse for her to follow up with the resentment after the fact. but you did sort of put her on the spot to get what you wanted. are there past interactions that would lead her to see this as a pattern of playing-innocent-but-being-manipulative character? her text definitely seems freighted with more than just this itneraction", "You could have still called your other prior doctor foe advice even if not living around there anymore. If u just found out you were  newly pregnant Thursday, what symptoms were you having that made you feel you need to rule out an ectopic pregnancy in ER on the same wkend? The baby has to be far enough along growing in the tube to be medical emergency when the tube could rupture\u2026 \nSomething is missing in your story OP. Based on the response you got I am guessing this isn\u2019t your first rodeo with overreactions.", ">On Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls\n\nIn the comments, you said you called her once. Who did you call countless times? I feel like there is important pertinent information missing here, and you did put this ER doctor in an awkward situation. If you felt you emergently needed tests, you should have checked yourself into the ER. It sounds like you were nervous due to your medical history, but that burden should not be put on a family friend on her day off just because of her profession, and you should have sought care through the appropriate channels.", "YTA \n\nCome on - you know it was wildly inappropriate to phone an off duty ER doctor with your concerns.   You just do not do that \n\nIt could and it did wait until the next day \n\nHowever the doctor is also an AH.  That was also a wildly inappropriate and over the top message \n\nI can only say she is probably massively over worked saving lives and was on her last nerve getting a call in her down time from you", "YTA. She\u2019s not your doctor, not even an ObGYN so it was not really appropriate to approach her in a work capacity in this way at midnight. Also it may have been that she thought you were trying to involve her in a potential deliberation over an abortion of what would be her best friend\u2019s grandchild", "So you basically told your BF's mom's best friend that he was going to be a father before anyone told his mom.  And because you did that outside of a professional setting, you put her in a really bad position, because even though your request was personal, she was restrained by professional standards from telling his mother or even addressing it with you in the middle of her free consult.\n\nAnd she very well may have gotten grief from her best friend for knowing she was going to have a grandchild and not immediately telling her.\n\nAll that is before the fact that medical professionals frequently deal with people looking for free advice or even examination and it gets very old for them, very fast.\n\nYou were an AH for putting her in that position.  She was an AH for the level of vitriol in her text (and at midnight, too--I have to wonder if alcohol may have been involved).\n\nESH", "YTA", "ESH. Eh, I'm going to go with everybody sucking in various ways.\n\nI think OP acted in a kind of immature and panicky way. It is kind of all over the place... on the one hand, disregarding the ER's recommendation to come in, but still expecting on-demand service from this off-call doctor; getting all angsty about the mere hypothetical possibility of another ectopic pregnancy, when even those don't grow in mere hours; insisting on needing a referral right away, but not willing to go thru normal avenues to get it. Most probably this positive preg test could have probably just been handled in ER, urgent care that night, or Fri morning call to providers .  So honestly, I probably the doctor's resentment is partially born of impatience with the larger factors of age etc. In my experience, people thought my young-woman anxiety was sympathetic until about age 25, and then it all but evaporated oncepregnancy and kids were in the picture... then if I didn't have stuff lined up like my own GP/OBGYN or pediatrician for the kids or was still asking for favors/rides to save money, people were just like 'wut is wrong with you, get your shit together. your disorganization or cost-saving efforts are not my emergency'. it was harsh, but i did need to grow up a bit. it is precisely these kinds of adult things that make you resilient and eventually able to handle stuff calmly. i don't know that that's necessarily what's going on with OP, but the content of the text suggests the doctor-acquaintance at least perceives OP as using little-girl anxiety drama in life or using it to get people's help. Unfortunately, as I have gotten older, especially if a middle-aged or olde woman responsible for kids, I have found the world only gets less and less sympathetic.\n\nAt the same time, this doctor seems to have kind of blown a gasket, or let this interaction get to her head in a weird way too. why didn't she just draw the boundaryto begin with and say, no, i'm not your doctor? and why did she tell the friend/BF's mom if she knew it was going to create drama during her trip? and why was she still stewing on this days later and texting angrily at midnight. so it sounds like she has maturity/boundary issues too. If she doesn't want to offer free services to acquaintances, then she should have shut it down right away, rather than giving the referall and then stewing with resentment over it.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s completely normal to reach out to a doctor friend. I understand the doctor could have felt that she was put in a difficult situation. I\u2019m unsure whether hipaa would actually cover this situation if you reached out as a friend BUT she could always have used it as cover for keeping your medical questions secret. If she spoke to boyfriends mom after the referral to OB then she certainly violated hipaa laws. \nI\u2019m concerned for you what a conversation between boyfriends mom and best friend looked like if that\u2019s the response you got.", "That's really fkn weird and there is absolutely a reason why she reacted in that way. I'm not sure why.. so it's hard to comment on this situation. But if you see no reason why she would react in that way, I don't see how you're in the wrong at all. I think what you did was perfectly fine. If there aren't any issues between you two then maybe she has been taken advantage of a lot in the past so reacted that way because of that.", "I don\u2019t fully understand her issue but her text is incredibly cruel so for that reason, NTA. \u201cThe sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act\u2026\u201d I mean wow. Talk about a lack of empathy. Obviously she\u2019s not obligated to give you medical advice but she\u2019s 45, she should know how to set boundaries. Everyone I know who works in the medical field sets that boundary with friends and family, it\u2019s a necessary skill set.", "I would just reply \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I over stepped your boundaries, it wasn\u2019t deliberate, and it won\u2019t happen again. Thank you for your help.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t do anything to escalate this drama.  \n\nNTA", "NTA, I get that doctors don't want to constantly be asked their medical opinions in their free time, but you were in a difficult situation and just wanted advice how to proceed.\nHer response is a complete overreaction and I don't get it at all. How did you put her in a difficult situation, how did you strain her relationship with X, how did you ruin her vacation? Her calling you manipulative and sociopathic was completely uncalled for.", "NTA. Furthermore, I would never have any interaction with this person again for two reasons: \n1.  She clearly said she wants nothing to do with you. \n2. Your actions in the past (this situation included) have been misconstrued and she has formed an opinion of you without ever asking questions to clarify and/or justify or disarm her thoughts of you. \n\nI would also be very mindful and thoughtful of anything shared with your boyfriend\u2019s mother as well. This misguided image of you is coming from and being embraced somewhere.  \n\nI wish you and your boyfriend the best in your pregnancy. You will have enough to worry about and this should be a joyous occasion and moment in your life. To hell with her and whatever misguided image she has of you.", "[deleted]", "could it be possible that she got in any trouble at her actual job for giving advice \u201coff the clock\u201d? or was told by her higher ups that she needed to remain professional and she was just trying to set a boundary? idk the language from her message was way too formal + aggressive. i also feel like something is missing", "NTA. \n\nThough there seem to be something else going on. Insinuating the news of your pregnancy would ruin BF's mother's vacation and saying your situation was a manipulated drama. That's really insulting and seems to step of from some other repressed issues. \n\nInfo: Did you have any issues prior to this with either of them?", "You asked a medical question and she responded. She doesn't want to treat you due to her relationship with your MIL, thats fine. But no way in hell is she, as a medical professional, allowed to pass your medical information to a third party. Friend or not. Her proffesionality does not change because she knows mil or you. She put herself in a difficult position, not you. If she is not comfortable being part of your medical treatment than she is allowed to state that, but she needs to learn to communicate properly cause this isn't it.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t even make sense- if she was uncomfortable helping you should could have simply told you to go to the emergency room- just as every single on-call nurse tells anyone who calls them for like every problem ever- it\u2019s the standard \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for your health\u201d answer. Calling you manipulative and sociopathic doesn\u2019t add up- so something must have happened to prompt that. I\u2019d want to know more about the interaction she had with your BF\u2019s mom, because things don\u2019t add up.", "NTA. A good doctor will help anyone and everyone and not chastise those in desperate times. This does not seem like a reasonable response from a good doctor for mind. Calling it your \u201cpersonal drama\u201d is wholly unnecessary. She in no way needed to chastise you for having concerns and your reaching out to a friend for advise on how to proceed during a scary and profoundly stressful time. \n\nAs a heath professional, one expects to be approached by friends and family for advice on things like this. And her response was wildly inappropriate.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to politely recommend seeking advice elsewhere in the future, but this was ludicrous in my opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have to assume that is not the case since you have no obgyn services established in your new area. At best, if you were trying for a child, youre showing poor judgement and planning by not already having local obgyn care established. \n\nShe likely saw someone in essentially an active mental health crisis. You were exhibiting clear anxiety in your reaction to a home pregnancy test before you even called her (Which also leads me to believe this wasnt expected. Once again, if this was planned, you needed to already have care established due to your risk level). What she sees is someone who wasnt being proactive or careful, then place their burden onto someone else and make their situation an emergency to a stranger for a situation they knew was risky and apparently didnt take sufficient steps to prevent. Add to that you seem only concerned about your well being, rather than worrying about their best friends grandchild's wellbeing. I see some red flags, id definitely warn my best friend about if I was her.\n\nSure the mom's friend could have been nicer about telling you off, but given the lack of common sense respect you showed to her boundaries, Id cut her a little slack in terms of her response. The relationship is supposed to be as a family friend, not your free on call medical professional. Giving her an update on the situation was furthering the unnecessary burden (bpth time and emotionally) that you put on her. Part of why she probably found your behavior problematic was that youre mixing her two roles. She cannot be a family friend and a doctor at the same time. Wearing both of those hats at the same time raises ethical questions. \n\nSo to summarize, you used poor judgement in your day to day life, ended up in a risky but entirely preventable situation. You let your past experienes and anxiety overtake logic, and then expected a complete stranger to do you a huge favor (that also makes her look unprofessional), while puttting her in an ethically questionable place, which you did more than once by updating her. \n\nYou could have simply waited until you spoke to the mom and gave an update through her. Please respect her boundaries from now on. At most, I would, tell the mother you feel terrible and would like to apologize.", "ESH/YTA. The panicked 12 am call was unnecessary. I understand you\u2019re scared, ectopic pregnancies are extremely dangerous. However, if you were bleeding or had any pain, you could have went to the ER. There was zero reason besides impatience and anxiety for you to be contacting to doctor friend in the middle of the night. \n\nThe doctor, could have easily referred you to someone else, told you to go to the ER, or simply not responded until morning. If she didn\u2019t want to be part of your care, she deffo could have just said that. \u2018I am unavailable at this time, you can either contact my clinic during business hours or find another specialist.\u2019 Simple.

I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone.\u201d\n\nWTF. How can you even write this. SHE IS NOT YOUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. CALL YOUR OWN DOCTOR.", "NTA. I\u2019d show the messages to your bfs mom and ask if she knows what\u2019s going on, explain the previous ectopic pregnancy and that your bf told you to call her, and ask her to clarify why her friend is so upset she\u2019s name-calling the mother of her best friends grand baby.\n\nThen please update because I really wanna know!!", "NTA. This woman must have misunderstood something gigantic. As you say, perhaps she thought she had to hide it from her best friend or something.

It wasn't like you called her up to tell her about your toe fungus, she knows the medical system there and you asked for advice. If she for real feels this strongly about the \"I'm not everyone's doctor!\" Then she should have just said \"Sorry, but I cannot comment on it as a doctor. It would probably be best you got to the er officially.\"", "YTA\n\nSo you\u2019re wondering during the call why she was so nice to you. \n\nShe was hearing you panicking on the phone, so likely she did her best to calm you and reassure. Then you followed her plan and did get reassurance. Now knowing all is well, then she sent you the text saying it was inappropriate. That makes sense because she felt burdened to take care of you when you called in the moment. \n\nDoctors are humans too. Your boyfriend making sure she was home with nothing to do (WTF) doesn\u2019t mean she wants to deal with medical issues on her time off. People do this to med folk all the time. \n\nAlso my guess is she already talked to her best friend about this and MIL doesn\u2019t like you and doesn\u2019t like that you used her best friend.

You played up your fears in order to manipulate her into doing you a favor.\n\nI would feel much more sympathetic and inclined to believe you were panicked and made an honest error in judgement if it weren't for the fact that you skewed the story to make it seem like you were in fear for you life, which you were not.", "More info needed- This is confusing. I think there\u2019s info you left out. What symptoms were you having that led you to call X when she wasn\u2019t working? And didX speak with boyfriend and boyfriend\u2019s mom about the phone call? That\u2019s the only reason I can think of on why she feels she\u2019s being pulled into drama.\n\nEdit: As a physician myself, I\u2019m going to say YTA. Had this been a situation where you were just asking for medical advice, I would say NTA. BUT after reading thru some of your responses, it looks like your conversation was more than just asking for medical advice\u2026 you were also asking her to refer you to an obgyn specialist who can see you within days, and at that moment you were asymptomatic (meaning, not showing urgent symptoms that needed to be addressed at that moment). Personally I\u2019m okay with friends asking me for medical advice. But I would be annoyed if I was being put in a situation where someone was pressuring me for a specialist referral when they are asymptomatic at a time when I\u2019m not even working. Unlike what you mentioned in the title of your post, your pregnancy advice was not urgent.", "INFO: how did this ruin your bf\u2019s mum\u2019s vacation?

You should have gone to emergency professionals ie docs, lawyers, accountants have to deal with stuff like this all the time from family,. friends and strangers.  It puts them at professional risk should anything happen.", "info. how did you go out of your way to ruin a vacation.? why the name calling from her? either you're not giving us a lot of details or she's slipped a gear. \n\nI mean really?  assuming you've given us all the details NTA. you asked a family friend for advice and she wnet ballistic?. when I was a kid I had an accident on my bike. our neighbor was a doctor and I played with his kids. I called up and he was fine coming over to make sure the leg/ankle weren't broken. \"just a really bad sprain, chris has some crutches he can drop off tomorrow\"", "That feels like such an extreme response form her especially as you appear to have a good relationship. Is it possible an angry partner could have sent it?", "NTA. You were in what you thought was an emergency situation, and your doctor wasn\u2019t available, and a friend of the family was. Perfectly OK for you to ask her if she could talk to you. It would also have been perfectly OK for her to say no, but she didn\u2019t. Her talking to you like a professional and then (drunk?) texting you at 12 AM two days later to ream you out about it is messed up behavior. If she didn\u2019t want to talk to you, she shouldn\u2019t have talked to you, but asking was OK under the circumstances.\n\nEditing to add: Her telling your boyfriend\u2019s mom without your permission is also messed up. She sounds unhinged.", "It is absolutely baffling to me that anyone is calling you an AH. You are clearly NTA. \n\nYou were worried about a medical emergency and you reached out once to a medical professional with whom you and your boyfriend have a personal relationship. You asked for advice, she provided the advice and offered a referral, which you accepted. She could have told you that she didn\u2019t want to advise you, she couldn\u2019t tell you anything without examining you/running labs, it wasn\u2019t her speciality, etc. - instead she offered help.

If anyone was an AH it was that doctor. Did she gave to send such a stroppy late night text?? F*** her. Best of luck with the pregnancy.", "NTA. I am not understanding this bizarre overreaction. Just avoid this weirdo in the future and worry no longer about whatever their damage is.", "Hang on. Did she discuss what she discussed with you without your consent to her friend/your boyfriends mom? Thats illegal for a medical professional to do. She CANNOT disclose private information regarding a patient (which you were as soon as she gave a referral).\n\nAlso, is she not aware of the hippocratic oath?", "Yeah, I work in healthcare. We get asked a lot about advice from other professions or friends or even friends of friend etc. Sure we sometimes get annoyed but I honestly don\u2019t know anyone who would react like this, they would simply say they don\u2019t want to get involved.

You know each other personally and she had a few outs she could have taken to deny you the favor, although IMO I would always help someone close to me out in an emergency situation and everyone I know would do the same.

It's not the same as your ectopic pregnancy, (and I am very sorry for your loss) but I understand the fear of knowing something bad has happened and needing to have as much information and control of a situation as possible, so honestly I don't think you were at fault for asking for her help.

It makes the most sense from your story that the bfs mom said something to her best friend about your handling of the situation that want nice towards you.", "The doctor offered it herself. OP wasn't asking for it. Sure it's a big favor but I see no reason to be mad about it 3 days later?", "You go about it by asking her if there's anything she wants to share, explaining that you received some texts from her friend that confused, and showing her the texts.", "I think we\u2019re missing the other person\u2019s side of the story to be honest.

Did you have anything else happening to you to cause you to be concerned besides new knowledge that you were pregnant again? Just curious.", "I'm a lawyer who sometimes gets those questions and I feel like it is not out of line to ask someone that you know is a doctor, \"should I seek emergency care or wait till the doctor calls back?\"\n\nYou're not asking for a diagnosis or very much of her time, just an idea of what she would do in your place. \n\nShe should be well aware of how to (1) politely decline to offer advice or (2) say, \"I can't possibly know or give you advice without an exam, but these get serious very quickly/I wouldn't be worried unless x.\"\n\nI just don't buy that it's a big deal. Yeah, it is kind of annoying sometimes, but when someone asks and I'm busy, I just don't answer until I'm free. \n\nHer comment at 12am was unhinged and aggressive and I'd stay far away from her in the future. There is so much that is inappropriate about it that it's hard to even know where to start. My opinion is that as a doctor/lawyer, you are the professional and that this is a situation you should be prepared to address calmly and professionally. It is totally possible to set boundaries without name calling at 12am. This woman worries me.\n\nEdited to add: I'm just seeing that you asked her to pull strings and get you in to see a specialist friend???? Okay, YTA for that one, big time. One question about whether you should be worried, okay. Asking her to call around and calling in favors for you is a whole different ballgame.", "Girl, it makes sense you were afraid. Your first pregnancy was traumatic. Anyone with a teaspoon of empathy would see that. What she said was cruel. It would be one thing if she had some boundaries she felt necessary to communicate to you. Maybe she felt like you were vying for a referral and using her. I think you were terrified, understandably overwhelmed, and understandably not thinking like you would if you had been calm. Again, she should know this. Her cruelty was unwarrented here.", "Why do we assume it is misguided? We have no idea who any of these people are.", "I appreciate how diplomatic you are in your responses to everyone here.

(Maybe I've been reading too much reddit) A teenaged kid perhaps?\n\nEspecially since it seems out of the blue and specifically said don't reply, if someone sent the text from her phone then deleted it, she might never know. \n\nI would talk to your bf and bf mom first, maybe she can help clear the air or see if it was normal for her friend, but someone else getting a hold of the phone might explain it?", "I don't see the part where the ER told her to in to the ER. Am I missing it in the post or did OP remove it?", "The issue here is while working with patients in a professional setting, the doctor has consented to keeping those secrets or offering her help. This sounds like an offer to \u201cnot feel obligated\u201d during a panicked call, I\u2019m having trouble believing the option to not help sounded genuine. As a child of a family practice doctor, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how insane boundaries have to be to patients. This stuff happens regularly", "I don't think you did anything wrong.  I'd not even like you did this without advice either, you talked with your boyfriend about it before you called her.

If knowing would have changed my judgement, I would have asked INFO.  \n\nBut if you were so concerned about invasive questions, why did you post on the internet? What did you expect? \n\nYou might find it invasive but so is expecting a medical advice or an appointment referral from someone you dont know. It is also entirely relevant. I hope you at least informed her of your BC status, because hormonal contraception is associated with higher risk of ectopic pregnancy so it could have impacted the advice she gave.\n\nThat question was rhetorical, I guarentee you it crossed her mind. Lets pretend you guys are planning for the baby. Why didnt you already have your own obgyn there? As I said, at best you come across as extremely unprepared for a situation that you knew would be risky.

She told you that you could follow up. She gave you a referral.

I definitely had fairly bad cramps and exhaustion and other symptoms I don\u2019t need to get into to spare you ha - but those are all very normal first trimester things. \n\nThe only real signs I had leading up to the ectopic rupture my first pregnancy were some strange sharp pains in my left shoulder the night it happened a few hours before.

And there was no expectation on your part of any further medical help from her--which she would have known since she literally referred you to another doctor for your future care. \n\nIf you had contacted her again for help then it would make sense for her to set a boundary, but not 3 days after your interaction when you hadn't \"bothered\" her again. \n\nYes--please update!", "Have you been able to talk to your boyfriend or his mom about this yet? I\u2019m thinking some insight from someone else who knows everyone involved would be more helpful than all these strangers on Reddit, just given the completely unproportional-seeming text response days later from the Dr/ friend. It\u2019s just so bizarre that there has to be something else going on here that you very possibly aren\u2019t even aware of", "Personally I think NTA. Have you spoken to your boyfriend and his mum yet? Super curious to know what they think about this crazy interaction.", "That\u2019s a patient choice.

A lot. A huge amount. \nFurthermore, she likely has knowledge that you do not have access to right now- does your bf want a baby? Is he now freaking out and texting you all the time instead of enjoying his holiday with his mom? Does his mother have negative feelings about you being pregnant, and is now complaining to her friend that you\u2019re not who she wanted to be the mother of her grandkids, or even that now she is worried and not enjoying herself as carefree as she had been before? \n\nThe proper course of action in my opinion would have been for you to immediately go to the ER, and upon hearing the news that it seems everything is ok, waited for your bf to come home to share the news or at least till you were next speaking to him anyway, instead of possibly pulling him out of an event to make a series of panicked phone calls. Then you could have told his mother together- again without the stress of is it/isn\u2019t it.  \n\nI think the doctors text will likely make more sense when everyone is home and you have both sides of the story. I also think YTA for indeed creating a circle of drama of people contacting other people to get permission for you to contact them, talking to someone is is not your doctor and who is not a specialist in that field on their time off and putting them in a position where if the worst had happened and their advice had been wrong could have had dealthly results for you AND their career.", "\ud83e\udd23 could also be a coworker or different friend she ranted to while out drinking that took her phone while she went to the bathroom.

It could indicate the friend as aiding and abetting\n an abortion. \n\nI agree with you that giving this advice is a big reason why doctors are so scared to help pregnant people nowadays.", "I call BS on that reasoning Monica.
