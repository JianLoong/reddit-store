I recently moved to the area my boyfriend grew up in. I do not have a doctor here yet. My boyfriend and his mom are away visiting family across the country. \n\nI am very close with his mom and have also gotten close with her best friend (F ~45) who is currently living temporarily with her locally and is an ER doctor here. \n\nOn Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls, I was debating going to the ER for testing / ultrasound (not ideal obviously but I needed to see a specialist asap). \n\nFor quick context on why I had to react quickly, I had an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago that resulted in sudden internal bleeding and a near death emergency surgery. I am very high risk for another one.\n\nSo, after discussing with my boyfriend and taking his advice, I called the friend of his mom who was home and off-duty.\n\nI explained my situation very directly and calmly and asked for her direction. \n\nShe told me to not rush to an ER and gave a referral for the next day. I expressed how appreciative I was. She said call if anything came up that evening, and the conversation ended amicably. \n\nFast forward 3 days. I receive a text at 12am from her. Here it is with some redactions for privacy:\n\n\u201cI feel that it is necessary that I make you aware of a few things. I feel that it was wholly inappropriate that you involve me in your personal drama.\n\nX (boyfriend\u2019s mom) is my best friend. I was placed in a no win situation by a person who clearly doesn\u2019t understand boundaries. A person who relies on the fact that people are kind and accommodating even when their personal comfort is compromised. The sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act is just that\u2014 an act. \n\nWhat I see is a subversive manipulative sociopathic person who had to go out of her way to ruin X\u2019s vacation. And you used me to do it. Because you clearly have issues with boundaries I\u2019m going to make this crystal clear. I am not interested in any further interaction with you. The Dr (her last name) free clinic is closed  You have crossed a line and I do not want to be saddled with your issues medical or otherwise. There is no need to respond to this text.\u201d\n\nWhile calling her was a difficult choice and my last resort, the more I\u2019ve sat on the text message, the more I\u2019ve started to think I am the asshole for not considering further the position I was putting her in. I can see how she felt I overstepped given her friendship with X. I spoke with X on my own on Friday, but that\u2019s irrelevant here.\n\nOn the other hand, I can\u2019t shake that - especially as a medical professional - she reduced my health concerns I shared with her over a risky pregnancy to drama in a 12am text. I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone. \n\nAITA for involving someone - who I now very clearly know didn\u2019t want to be involved - in my pregnancy situation?\n\nClarification edit: our phone call was at 5pm, not 12am. 12am was when I received the text message 3 nights later.", "created_utc": 1683533823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bicmc/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_moms_best_friend/", "score": 2242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cause there is no world where a doctor would react like that if a high risk patient just asks for a medical advice?", "INFO Based on what's written here, I'm inclined towards N T A. But I can't help but feel something is missing. While a doctor may not like giving out advice while not in duty, that reaction, especially the personal verbal attack, is over the top. Either relevant context is missing  and the doctor did a good job at hiding how she felt over the phone, only expressing herself a few days later, or something happened in the 3 days after related to OP that changes how the doctor  thought.  Without knowing why I'm not comfortable giving judgment.", "I feel like there is a HUGE chunk of information missing here.", "There seems to be some info missing here. I understand that you did a test and found out you were pregnant. And that you know that you\u2019re at high-risk for a second ectopic pregnancy. But I don\u2019t understand who the \u201ccountless unanswered calls\u201d were placed to or why? Or what symptoms you were having that caused you to \u201cneed a specialist asap\u201d? And the level of hostility in the doctor\u2019s message suggests that she believes you to be, at minimum, a manipulative person. \n\nBottom Line: If you were cramping, bleeding, or in pain, then you should have called an ambulance and gone to the ER immediately. \nIf you were not having any symptoms, but were fearful because of your last pregnancy, then ~~you needed to do something~~ it would have been good for you to try to calm down- call your bf, call a friend and talk to them. Under the circumstances, having lost your first baby within 24 hours of a positive pregnancy test, panicking doesn\u2019t seem OTT. I think I would have done the same! ~~Neither of these required you to call a doctor you did not know for advice. ESH. ~~\n\nNTA.\n\nEdits: clarity. Edit 2: Changed judgement, given answers from OP.", "I\u2019m getting the feeling something else happened. Did you harass the doctor? This is not something someone would send from 1 concerned phone call.", "YTA. you didnt ask for advice, you asked for a referral. Totally different and you're burying the lede. She's right to text you setting a firm boundary, you basically used your relationship with her to get her to work for free because you didnt want to listen to the advice youd already been given by ER", "YTA.\n\n'Emergency department just told me to come into the emergency department. Which I was hoping to avoid by making an appointment for Friday with an Obgyn.\n\nI asked the friend for a big favor/help referring me to an Obgyn that could see me before the weekend.'\n\nYou didn't call her for advice; you called for a favour because you wanted a referral. You didn't want to follow ERs advice. That did put her in an uncomfortable position; to her credit, she helped you, but I can absolutely see why she feels her boundaries were stomped over here. I think her text to you was spot on and you do need to reflect on this behaviour. I wouldn't even phone one of my best friends asking them to do something like this for me.", "ESH, with qualifiers. Medical people work hard enough without being consulted by every acquaintance. I can understand them having firm boundaries, and I can understand people pushing those boundaries in emergencies.\n\nSo I was kinda leaving towards you being slightly socially the A, in an understandable, sometimes-you-gotta-be-the-asshole kind of way. But, unless you've left out a bunch of drama, the message you received is pretty unnecessarily vicious. I guess she was just lashing out because she didn't feel able to say no at the time. I'd shrug your shoulders and just leave it.", "YTA. per the comments, you had already decided not to go to the ER and wanted a referral stat, so decided to pull a 'friend' card to get that. I can understand why you did it in prioritizing yourself and your health, but not sure why you're surprised about the off-duty doctor acquaintance feeling inappropriately used. i mean, maybe its her fault too for not just saying 'sorry, can't help' immediately when you called, since this is def worse for her to follow up with the resentment after the fact. but you did sort of put her on the spot to get what you wanted. are there past interactions that would lead her to see this as a pattern of playing-innocent-but-being-manipulative character? her text definitely seems freighted with more than just this itneraction", "You could have still called your other prior doctor foe advice even if not living around there anymore. If u just found out you were  newly pregnant Thursday, what symptoms were you having that made you feel you need to rule out an ectopic pregnancy in ER on the same wkend? The baby has to be far enough along growing in the tube to be medical emergency when the tube could rupture\u2026 \nSomething is missing in your story OP.

Who did you call countless times? I feel like there is important pertinent information missing here, and you did put this ER doctor in an awkward situation. If you felt you emergently needed tests, you should have checked yourself into the ER. It sounds like you were nervous due to your medical history, but that burden should not be put on a family friend on her day off just because of her profession, and you should have sought care through the appropriate channels.", "YTA \n\nCome on - you know it was wildly inappropriate to phone an off duty ER doctor with your concerns.   You just do not do that \n\nIt could and it did wait until the next day \n\nHowever the doctor is also an AH.  That was also a wildly inappropriate and over the top message \n\nI can only say she is probably massively over worked saving lives and was on her last nerve getting a call in her down time from you", "YTA. She\u2019s not your doctor, not even an ObGYN so it was not really appropriate to approach her in a work capacity in this way at midnight. Also it may have been that she thought you were trying to involve her in a potential deliberation over an abortion of what would be her best friend\u2019s grandchild", "So you basically told your BF's mom's best friend that he was going to be a father before anyone told his mom.  And because you did that outside of a professional setting, you put her in a really bad position, because even though your request was personal, she was restrained by professional standards from telling his mother or even addressing it with you in the middle of her free consult.\n\nAnd she very well may have gotten grief from her best friend for knowing she was going to have a grandchild and not immediately telling her.\n\nAll that is before the fact that medical professionals frequently deal with people looking for free advice or even examination and it gets very old for them, very fast.\n\nYou were an AH for putting her in that position.  She was an AH for the level of vitriol in her text (and at midnight, too--I have to wonder if alcohol may have been involved).\n\nESH", "YTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s completely normal to reach out to a doctor friend. I understand the doctor could have felt that she was put in a difficult situation. I\u2019m unsure whether hipaa would actually cover this situation if you reached out as a friend BUT she could always have used it as cover for keeping your medical questions secret. If she spoke to boyfriends mom after the referral to OB then she certainly violated hipaa laws. \nI\u2019m concerned for you what a conversation between boyfriends mom and best friend looked like if that\u2019s the response you got.", "That's really fkn weird and there is absolutely a reason why she reacted in that way. I'm not sure why.. so it's hard to comment on this situation. But if you see no reason why she would react in that way, I don't see how you're in the wrong at all. I think what you did was perfectly fine.

Talk about a lack of empathy. Obviously she\u2019s not obligated to give you medical advice but she\u2019s 45, she should know how to set boundaries.

How did you put her in a difficult situation, how did you strain her relationship with X, how did you ruin her vacation? Her calling you manipulative and sociopathic was completely uncalled for.", "NTA. Furthermore, I would never have any interaction with this person again for two reasons: \n1.  She clearly said she wants nothing to do with you. \n2. Your actions in the past (this situation included) have been misconstrued and she has formed an opinion of you without ever asking questions to clarify and/or justify or disarm her thoughts of you. \n\nI would also be very mindful and thoughtful of anything shared with your boyfriend\u2019s mother as well. This misguided image of you is coming from and being embraced somewhere.  \n\nI wish you and your boyfriend the best in your pregnancy. You will have enough to worry about and this should be a joyous occasion and moment in your life.

Insinuating the news of your pregnancy would ruin BF's mother's vacation and saying your situation was a manipulated drama. That's really insulting and seems to step of from some other repressed issues. \n\nInfo: Did you have any issues prior to this with either of them?", "You asked a medical question and she responded. She doesn't want to treat you due to her relationship with your MIL, thats fine. But no way in hell is she, as a medical professional, allowed to pass your medical information to a third party. Friend or not. Her proffesionality does not change because she knows mil or you. She put herself in a difficult position, not you. If she is not comfortable being part of your medical treatment than she is allowed to state that, but she needs to learn to communicate properly cause this isn't it.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t even make sense- if she was uncomfortable helping you should could have simply told you to go to the emergency room- just as every single on-call nurse tells anyone who calls them for like every problem ever- it\u2019s the standard \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for your health\u201d answer. Calling you manipulative and sociopathic doesn\u2019t add up- so something must have happened to prompt that. I\u2019d want to know more about the interaction she had with your BF\u2019s mom, because things don\u2019t add up.", "NTA. A good doctor will help anyone and everyone and not chastise those in desperate times. This does not seem like a reasonable response from a good doctor for mind. Calling it your \u201cpersonal drama\u201d is wholly unnecessary. She in no way needed to chastise you for having concerns and your reaching out to a friend for advise on how to proceed during a scary and profoundly stressful time. \n\nAs a heath professional, one expects to be approached by friends and family for advice on things like this. And her response was wildly inappropriate.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to politely recommend seeking advice elsewhere in the future, but this was ludicrous in my opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm a veterinarian,  the number of people I barely know that encroach on my personal time and abuse the fact that they barely know me to ask questions is amazing. If you really appreciated her help you would have offered to pay her, or bought her lunch or something. You didn't.  You abused her kindness and are shocked that she's now set a boundary.  Good for her.  Never,  ever,  ever bring work to someone you know unless its in a professional setting.  Go to the ER in person next time if you're so worried.", "Doctor in the US here. As a person who has been asked for advice by family and friends many times over the years, I understand the situation. This ER doctor was clearly not treating OP as a patient, she had no doctor/patient relationship with her and was only being asked for advice. Much like asking a lawyer friend a legal question or a mechanic friend a car question. There is no \u201cfriend board\u201c to report this doctor to, and reporting her to a medical licensing board would be ultimately pointless and frankly somewhat vindictive.  Our employers make it very clear that anything that we do outside of our job duties is not covered by malpractice, so there may be potential legal implications for this doctor giving advice, well intentioned or not. \n\nWith that said, I do find that text to be rather appalling. As a person who has been asked for advice many, many times, sometimes completely outside my realm of specialty (internal medicine/adult doctor being asked for advice about peoples kids, etc.) as a decent human being I try to always handle all these discussions respectfully. If there is advice I can give I will do so, while making it clear I am doing so as a friend and that I may not have access to their relevant medical history or other information that their actual medical provider does.  I always encourage them to contact their doctors, and make it clear if I really don\u2019t have the knowledge to help. Just like any other relationship, if you value it you do your best by that person when they need your help. And clearly a text like this would fracture the relationship beyond repair, and obviously seems beyond cruel to send to a scared pregnant woman. \n\nI suppose the only caveat to that would be if there is some additional context that OP has not revealed to us regarding behavior and boundaries in the past. I do think one thing that raises a bit of a red flag would be that OP put the Dr in the position of knowing a pretty huge secret that this Drs best friend/boyfriends mom does not know. Let me also add that I am a female doctor who has been through pregnancies myself, so I do understand the panic when complications occur. Personally, if I was OP and the pregnancy was still a secret even from close family, I would have just gone to the ER rather than put that kind of pressure on the friend, doctor or not.  And advice given from a distance particularly regarding an emergent situation like a possible ectopic pregnancy may not be good advice, she needs to be seen and evaluated by medical professionals. Even a simple vitals check which I\u2019m sure that they were not able to do could impact decision making and the urgency of a need to evaluate.  I\u2019m not sure what verdict to give but based on the info it sounds like they both may be in the wrong so maybe ESH.", "NTA AT ALL!

There is a line between personal and professional, and although you wanted it to be a strictly professional call (related to her advice and work), you reached out to her as a personal connection, off-duty. \n\nI wonder if what happened is that because of that, she mentioned it off-handed my to the mother (or not offhandedly), thinking that being a personal issue you reached out to her for, that the mother must have known? And was perhaps stunned to find out she was the one spilling the beans? \n\n2. I would guess that in response she may have felt used - as though you called HER in particular knowing that it would come up and that she would tell the mom, so you didn\u2019t need to tell her yourself.\n\n3. She likely further thinks that you are using your previous emergency to acquire sympathy and make it appear that you had no other options but to phone and involve her. However, although you said you made a number of calls, if it was a true emergency, you should have gone in to an emergency centre for support as it sounds like you say very clearly that you needed to be seen by a specialist right away.\n\n4. I do think she has made your next steps a bit easier by the text she sent you; she is setting a very hard boundary not to interact with you. So regardless of why she thinks what she thinks, fair or unfair, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a wise choice to be leaning on someone like that for support if they for some reason have developed this low opinion of you. I am a little stunned myself that she would send such a harsh text, but there is likely more to HER perspective - and I don\u2019t think you should bother trying to find it out because it honestly does not seem fair.\n\n5. Your hormones are going to be wacked out the next little bit. From now on, you are protecting that baby\u2019s stress level as much as your own. Take your prenatals, follow the advice of your own OB or midwife, join a mom group on Facebook or a sub to get support, and focus on cutting out anything and anyone who increases your stress level. \n\nMove on and move forward from this, and keep strong personal vs professional boundaries from now on to protect your privacy AND your sanity! Wishing you all the best of luck OP!!\n\nEDIT: Thanks OP for the award - I genuinely do hope this helped you out!", "It\u2019s absolutely alright for her to not want to be bothered by medical questions on her off-time, and she really should have said she no\u2014that she couldn\u2019t offer advice out of the clinic. \n\nCalling you a \u201csubversive manipulative sociopathic person\u201d and saying that your \u201csweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act was just an act\u201d was absolutely uncalled for, and boy did that come out of left field. \n\nShow your BF the text.

If there were no boundaries communicated to you, there was no way for you to know that you were crossing them. When you called, if she had a problem providing free medical advice, she should have said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t help you the way you need if you are not my patient, you should go to the ER.\u201d If she helped you for free and then later regretted it, or feared that she would be taken advantage of if she continued to provide her services to you for free, she could have communicated that to you and even asked for payment in a kind and professional manner. There was no reason to personally insult you in the way that she did.\n\nIf this was about personal boundaries, and not professional ones, my original point still stands - those boundaries need to be communicated. She can not expect you to read her mind and magically divine everything about her relationship with your boyfriends mom. If there is a reason that talking to her was inappropriate (which I can\u2019t see and don\u2019t understand) there was no way for you to know. \n\nI really think she is projecting something on to you or there is something going on that you don\u2019t know about. A surprising pregnancy when you are at high risk of fatal complications is a medical situation, not \u201cpersonal drama\u201d. It\u2019s actually shocking to me that as a doctor she would reduce it to that.", "YTA - if you're at such high risk for ectopic and life-threatening pregnancies, then it is YOUR responsibility to take proper action to avoid it. Then when you face the consequences of your actions, you inappropriately breach the ER doctors' personal boundaries because you did not want to go to the ER.\n\nAlso what vacation is being mentioned? How else do you rely on others to help you? No one is gonna call you out like this because of this one encounter.", "YTA. You shouldn't have done that and you got told.\n\nShe told you in a weird way, but she told you...", "Sounds like mommy dearest fed her a trough of bullshit.", "A lot of info missing here.

This is a serious problem that most health professionals have to deal with, people they know or even only know of them, calling in on private time asking medical advices even questions on facebook. I see this everywhere, when I go to a hairdresser e.g. I get asked medical questions. This is intolerable behavier, it doesn\u00b4t matter if you are scared, you should have contacted a professional on call not some random woman that you know is MD.", "YTA - a few of your comments are rubbing me the wrong way. \u201cI\u2019ll have to have thick skin to have this baby\u2026 my baby and I will be checking out of that\u201d.

I\u2019m not going to say your demeanor is an \u201cact\u201d as the good doctor implied, but a) a person who is high risk for further ectopic\u2026 were you trying to get pregnant, was their failed contraceptive? After such a traumatic incident, I\u2019m surprised your doctor didn\u2019t impress the importance of careful planning\u2026 b) you are not the only high risk pregnant patient\u2026 that is why the offices can\u2019t suddenly accommodate a brand new patient at the last minute and it is 100% why there are urgent cares and ERs. You do NOT need a specialized ob/gyn (as you stated in a previous comment) to check for an ectopic pregnancy. An internal or external ultrasound done in any environment will be able to see implantation area and the hospitals HAVE ob/gyns that they would have gotten a consult from if you had gone. \nIt appears that the doctor thinks you highly exaggerated your need for an immediate appointment. If the doctor gave a referral on behalf of you, it isn\u2019t against the law for that ob/gyn to have given feedback to the doctor\u2026 perhaps there is a lot missing that would lead the doctor to think you were dramatic and dishonest in your need and she has found that out and doesn\u2019t want to be involved. \n\nI could also be reaching and the ER doctor could be a jerk, but, I\u2019m gonna go with no to that", "Yes. I'm thinking the Dr. talked to the mom or bf, hence the message. OP talks about countless unanswered calls, to the bf? Idk, them being in another country, essentially helpless, and freaking out. I have a feeling OP's calls were much more dramatic then she realizes? & she turned out to be OK, so the Dr. feels like she used her to manipulate this situation to garner attention from bf while on vacation? I have no idea, this is Nancy Drewing it, a lot of context is missing. The BF or Mom are involved in the Dr. sending that text, I suspect.", "I'm wondering if the ER doc got chewed out at work for making the referral.

My partner and his entire family are in healthcare, and any time I have a health question he tells me to ask his mom. Friends have started going to him with medical questions and he is more than happy to help.\n\nSomeone else stated it above, but if you are debating between a potentially life threatening condition or potentially coming across as rude, one is significantly worse than the other.\n\n(just adding all my thoughts into this comment, but re: being told to go to the ER and not going-- the ER has to tell you to go to the ER. They could face liability if they don't. That's why it's helpful to ask a medical friend for a sanity check, since they are more likely to say nah an ER won't be helpful, or yes def go to the ER (or this is outside my expertise, or I don't want to make a reco)).", "I have explained the relationship in some other responses probably buried in here.

DH & I were traveling in our RV, several hours from civilization & about 1500 mi from our Dr, when DH passed out & hit his head hard on the floor. We weren't sure if we should go to the ER & get him checked out, or just watch. Luckily we had cell service, so I called my sis for advice.

I was told if I waited a few more hours, I probably would have had a very different outcome. I still get panicked when I think of that experience.

I hope you've spoken with them and they understand why you did what you did. I just reread that BF may have suggested it, that helps.\n\nI'm going to purely guess at the following part: dr never liked you but until now saw you as a temporary situation, expecting BF to dump you eventually, now you're pregnant she sees you as a threat to the structure of her relationship with the family so she is lashing out at you.", "What a horrible text message to receive. \n\nIf she felt uncomfortable giving advice outside of a professional setting theb she could have politely told you instead of saying all those horrible things.\n\nI'd love to know what your BF and his mum think about the text.

I've read all your comments, and I don't mean this to hurt you but you're an internet stranger and for all I know you ARE manipulative. (Or not, I don't have enough info to say for sure.) But based on what you've told us her response is totally unhinged, nuclear, as youve stated, and she has to realise that since she lives with the mum, SHE has now created an incredible drama that involves them all and has made your in-law's home an unwelcome place for you without the knowledge or permission of the in-law in question. She could have put up boundaries in a way that wasn't throwing hands like that. It reminds me of how i responded, as a TEENAGER, to someone who was indeed manipulative and using (and fucking up my life, because it involved my family and I had no way out, being a teenager,) but she was also a teenager and in retrospect probably had a personality disorder and its not how I'd handle it as an adult. Emphasis on the fact we were teenagers. She is not. So, regardless of if she has some reason to feel the way she does, and she may or may not, there's no excuse for a fully grown woman, a Dr no less, to address her concerns that way. I think she's probably got issues. And it doesn't sound like she really liked you, because the comment about your college isn't something you just randomly say. There's definitely more to this story. Sorry you're dealing with this. I hope things work out for you.", "updateme", "I read that comment though, and it didn't sound like OP demanded anything out of line.

I know you normally are booked/don't see people during this day or time, but is there anything I can manage right now?\"\n\nSometimes they say \"Yes, I can consult or no I cannot, but here's a colleague who can or no, you have to wait.\" But I don't feel that it hurts to ask.", "That would be highly unprofessionell", "Would you\u2026not call your boyfriend if you were unexpectedly pregnant and high risk for a recurrent ectopic?

Or, god forbid, let the morgue call him to tell him? \n\nThat\u2019s better than being \u201cattention-grabby\u201dright?\n\nSeriously, this is why women are so often under-diagnosed or misdiagnosed. Every symptom or concern is just a woman being \u201cdramatic\u201d. I\u2019m a doctor. I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s bullshit. The number of women (and a handful of men) I\u2019ve seen who were so fucking grateful to have a doctor actually listen to their concerns is staggering, even when I don\u2019t have an answer for them. Literally just acknowledging the symptom makes an impact when everyone else has ignored it or called them manipulative for daring to be alarmed.\n\nDid OP overreact? Sure. \n\nWas it an unreasonable overreaction? Given her history, not at all.\n\nThe doctor\u2019s response, though? That was a huge overreaction and frankly, a character assassination. I have had patients I genuinely thought were manipulative sociopaths (including convicted felons) and I would NEVER say that to them, because it is wildly inappropriate and unprofessional.
