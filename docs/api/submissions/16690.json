I recently moved to the area my boyfriend grew up in. I do not have a doctor here yet. My boyfriend and his mom are away visiting family across the country. \n\nI am very close with his mom and have also gotten close with her best friend (F ~45) who is currently living temporarily with her locally and is an ER doctor here. \n\nOn Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls, I was debating going to the ER for testing / ultrasound (not ideal obviously but I needed to see a specialist asap). \n\nFor quick context on why I had to react quickly, I had an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago that resulted in sudden internal bleeding and a near death emergency surgery. I am very high risk for another one.\n\nSo, after discussing with my boyfriend and taking his advice, I called the friend of his mom who was home and off-duty.\n\nI explained my situation very directly and calmly and asked for her direction. \n\nShe told me to not rush to an ER and gave a referral for the next day. I expressed how appreciative I was. She said call if anything came up that evening, and the conversation ended amicably. \n\nFast forward 3 days. I receive a text at 12am from her. Here it is with some redactions for privacy:\n\n\u201cI feel that it is necessary that I make you aware of a few things. I feel that it was wholly inappropriate that you involve me in your personal drama.\n\nX (boyfriend\u2019s mom) is my best friend. I was placed in a no win situation by a person who clearly doesn\u2019t understand boundaries. A person who relies on the fact that people are kind and accommodating even when their personal comfort is compromised. The sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act is just that\u2014 an act. \n\nWhat I see is a subversive manipulative sociopathic person who had to go out of her way to ruin X\u2019s vacation. And you used me to do it. Because you clearly have issues with boundaries I\u2019m going to make this crystal clear. I am not interested in any further interaction with you. The Dr (her last name) free clinic is closed  You have crossed a line and I do not want to be saddled with your issues medical or otherwise. There is no need to respond to this text.\u201d\n\nWhile calling her was a difficult choice and my last resort, the more I\u2019ve sat on the text message, the more I\u2019ve started to think I am the asshole for not considering further the position I was putting her in. I can see how she felt I overstepped given her friendship with X. I spoke with X on my own on Friday, but that\u2019s irrelevant here.\n\nOn the other hand, I can\u2019t shake that - especially as a medical professional - she reduced my health concerns I shared with her over a risky pregnancy to drama in a 12am text. I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone. \n\nAITA for involving someone - who I now very clearly know didn\u2019t want to be involved - in my pregnancy situation?\n\nClarification edit: our phone call was at 5pm, not 12am. 12am was when I received the text message 3 nights later.", "created_utc": 1683533823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bicmc/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_moms_best_friend/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cause there is no world where a doctor would react like that if a high risk patient just asks for a medical advice?", "INFO Based on what's written here, I'm inclined towards N T A. But I can't help but feel something is missing. While a doctor may not like giving out advice while not in duty, that reaction, especially the personal verbal attack, is over the top. Either relevant context is missing  and the doctor did a good job at hiding how she felt over the phone, only expressing herself a few days later, or something happened in the 3 days after related to OP that changes how the doctor  thought.  Without knowing why I'm not comfortable giving judgment.", "I feel like there is a HUGE chunk of information missing here.", "There seems to be some info missing here. I understand that you did a test and found out you were pregnant. And that you know that you\u2019re at high-risk for a second ectopic pregnancy. But I don\u2019t understand who the \u201ccountless unanswered calls\u201d were placed to or why? Or what symptoms you were having that caused you to \u201cneed a specialist asap\u201d? And the level of hostility in the doctor\u2019s message suggests that she believes you to be, at minimum, a manipulative person. \n\nBottom Line: If you were cramping, bleeding, or in pain, then you should have called an ambulance and gone to the ER immediately. \nIf you were not having any symptoms, but were fearful because of your last pregnancy, then you needed to do something to calm down- call your bf, call a friend and talk to them. Neither of these required you to call a doctor you did not know for advice. ESH. \n\nEdits: clarity.", "I\u2019m getting the feeling something else happened. Did you harass the doctor? This is not something someone would send from 1 concerned phone call.", "YTA. you didnt ask for advice, you asked for a referral. Totally different and you're burying the lede. She's right to text you setting a firm boundary, you basically used your relationship with her to get her to work for free because you didnt want to listen to the advice youd already been given by ER", "YTA.\n\n'Emergency department just told me to come into the emergency department. Which I was hoping to avoid by making an appointment for Friday with an Obgyn.\n\nI asked the friend for a big favor/help referring me to an Obgyn that could see me before the weekend.'\n\nYou didn't call her for advice; you called for a favour because you wanted a referral. You didn't want to follow ERs advice. That did put her in an uncomfortable position; to her credit, she helped you, but I can absolutely see why she feels her boundaries were stomped over here. I think her text to you was spot on and you do need to reflect on this behaviour. I wouldn't even phone one of my best friends asking them to do something like this for me.", "ESH, with qualifiers. Medical people work hard enough without being consulted by every acquaintance. I can understand them having firm boundaries, and I can understand people pushing those boundaries in emergencies.\n\nSo I was kinda leaving towards you being slightly socially the A, in an understandable, sometimes-you-gotta-be-the-asshole kind of way. But, unless you've left out a bunch of drama, the message you received is pretty unnecessarily vicious. I guess she was just lashing out because she didn't feel able to say no at the time. I'd shrug your shoulders and just leave it.", "YTA. per the comments, you had already decided not to go to the ER and wanted a referral stat, so decided to pull a 'friend' card to get that. I can understand why you did it in prioritizing yourself and your health, but not sure why you're surprised about the off-duty doctor acquaintance feeling inappropriately used. i mean, maybe its her fault too for not just saying 'sorry, can't help' immediately when you called, since this is def worse for her to follow up with the resentment after the fact. but you did sort of put her on the spot to get what you wanted. are there past interactions that would lead her to see this as a pattern of playing-innocent-but-being-manipulative character? her text definitely seems freighted with more than just this itneraction", "You could have still called your other prior doctor foe advice even if not living around there anymore. If u just found out you were  newly pregnant Thursday, what symptoms were you having that made you feel you need to rule out an ectopic pregnancy in ER on the same wkend? The baby has to be far enough along growing in the tube to be medical emergency when the tube could rupture\u2026 \nSomething is missing in your story OP. Based on the response you got I am guessing this isn\u2019t your first rodeo with overreactions.", ">On Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls\n\nIn the comments, you said you called her once. Who did you call countless times? I feel like there is important pertinent information missing here, and you did put this ER doctor in an awkward situation. If you felt you emergently needed tests, you should have checked yourself into the ER. It sounds like you were nervous due to your medical history, but that burden should not be put on a family friend on her day off just because of her profession, and you should have sought care through the appropriate channels.", "YTA \n\nCome on - you know it was wildly inappropriate to phone an off duty ER doctor with your concerns.   You just do not do that \n\nIt could and it did wait until the next day \n\nHowever the doctor is also an AH.  That was also a wildly inappropriate and over the top message \n\nI can only say she is probably massively over worked saving lives and was on her last nerve getting a call in her down time from you", "YTA. She\u2019s not your doctor, not even an ObGYN so it was not really appropriate to approach her in a work capacity in this way at midnight. Also it may have been that she thought you were trying to involve her in a potential deliberation over an abortion of what would be her best friend\u2019s grandchild", "So you basically told your BF's mom's best friend that he was going to be a father before anyone told his mom.  And because you did that outside of a professional setting, you put her in a really bad position, because even though your request was personal, she was restrained by professional standards from telling his mother or even addressing it with you in the middle of her free consult.\n\nAnd she very well may have gotten grief from her best friend for knowing she was going to have a grandchild and not immediately telling her.\n\nAll that is before the fact that medical professionals frequently deal with people looking for free advice or even examination and it gets very old for them, very fast.\n\nYou were an AH for putting her in that position.  She was an AH for the level of vitriol in her text (and at midnight, too--I have to wonder if alcohol may have been involved).\n\nESH", "YTA", "ESH. Eh, I'm going to go with everybody sucking in various ways.\n\nI think OP acted in a kind of immature and panicky way. It is kind of all over the place... on the one hand, disregarding the ER's recommendation to come in, but still expecting on-demand service from this off-call doctor; getting all angsty about the mere hypothetical possibility of another ectopic pregnancy, when even those don't grow in mere hours; insisting on needing a referral right away, but not willing to go thru normal avenues to get it. Most probably this positive preg test could have probably just been handled in ER, urgent care that night, or Fri morning call to providers .  So honestly, I probably the doctor's resentment is partially born of impatience with the larger factors of age etc. In my experience, people thought my young-woman anxiety was sympathetic until about age 25, and then it all but evaporated oncepregnancy and kids were in the picture... then if I didn't have stuff lined up like my own GP/OBGYN or pediatrician for the kids or was still asking for favors/rides to save money, people were just like 'wut is wrong with you, get your shit together. your disorganization or cost-saving efforts are not my emergency'. it was harsh, but i did need to grow up a bit. it is precisely these kinds of adult things that make you resilient and eventually able to handle stuff calmly. i don't know that that's necessarily what's going on with OP, but the content of the text suggests the doctor-acquaintance at least perceives OP as using little-girl anxiety drama in life or using it to get people's help. Unfortunately, as I have gotten older, especially if a middle-aged or olde woman responsible for kids, I have found the world only gets less and less sympathetic.\n\nAt the same time, this doctor seems to have kind of blown a gasket, or let this interaction get to her head in a weird way too. why didn't she just draw the boundaryto begin with and say, no, i'm not your doctor? and why did she tell the friend/BF's mom if she knew it was going to create drama during her trip? and why was she still stewing on this days later and texting angrily at midnight. so it sounds like she has maturity/boundary issues too. If she doesn't want to offer free services to acquaintances, then she should have shut it down right away, rather than giving the referall and then stewing with resentment over it.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s completely normal to reach out to a doctor friend. I understand the doctor could have felt that she was put in a difficult situation. I\u2019m unsure whether hipaa would actually cover this situation if you reached out as a friend BUT she could always have used it as cover for keeping your medical questions secret. If she spoke to boyfriends mom after the referral to OB then she certainly violated hipaa laws. \nI\u2019m concerned for you what a conversation between boyfriends mom and best friend looked like if that\u2019s the response you got.", "That's really fkn weird and there is absolutely a reason why she reacted in that way. I'm not sure why.. so it's hard to comment on this situation. But if you see no reason why she would react in that way, I don't see how you're in the wrong at all. I think what you did was perfectly fine. If there aren't any issues between you two then maybe she has been taken advantage of a lot in the past so reacted that way because of that.", "I don\u2019t fully understand her issue but her text is incredibly cruel so for that reason, NTA. \u201cThe sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act\u2026\u201d I mean wow. Talk about a lack of empathy. Obviously she\u2019s not obligated to give you medical advice but she\u2019s 45, she should know how to set boundaries. Everyone I know who works in the medical field sets that boundary with friends and family, it\u2019s a necessary skill set.", "I would just reply \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I over stepped your boundaries, it wasn\u2019t deliberate, and it won\u2019t happen again. Thank you for your help.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t do anything to escalate this drama.  \n\nNTA", "NTA, I get that doctors don't want to constantly be asked their medical opinions in their free time, but you were in a difficult situation and just wanted advice how to proceed.\nHer response is a complete overreaction and I don't get it at all. How did you put her in a difficult situation, how did you strain her relationship with X, how did you ruin her vacation? Her calling you manipulative and sociopathic was completely uncalled for.", "NTA. Furthermore, I would never have any interaction with this person again for two reasons: \n1.  She clearly said she wants nothing to do with you. \n2. Your actions in the past (this situation included) have been misconstrued and she has formed an opinion of you without ever asking questions to clarify and/or justify or disarm her thoughts of you. \n\nI would also be very mindful and thoughtful of anything shared with your boyfriend\u2019s mother as well. This misguided image of you is coming from and being embraced somewhere.  \n\nI wish you and your boyfriend the best in your pregnancy. You will have enough to worry about and this should be a joyous occasion and moment in your life. To hell with her and whatever misguided image she has of you.", "[deleted]", "could it be possible that she got in any trouble at her actual job for giving advice \u201coff the clock\u201d? or was told by her higher ups that she needed to remain professional and she was just trying to set a boundary? idk the language from her message was way too formal + aggressive. i also feel like something is missing", "NTA. \n\nThough there seem to be something else going on. Insinuating the news of your pregnancy would ruin BF's mother's vacation and saying your situation was a manipulated drama. That's really insulting and seems to step of from some other repressed issues. \n\nInfo: Did you have any issues prior to this with either of them?", "You asked a medical question and she responded. She doesn't want to treat you due to her relationship with your MIL, thats fine. But no way in hell is she, as a medical professional, allowed to pass your medical information to a third party. Friend or not. Her proffesionality does not change because she knows mil or you. She put herself in a difficult position, not you. If she is not comfortable being part of your medical treatment than she is allowed to state that, but she needs to learn to communicate properly cause this isn't it.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t even make sense- if she was uncomfortable helping you should could have simply told you to go to the emergency room- just as every single on-call nurse tells anyone who calls them for like every problem ever- it\u2019s the standard \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for your health\u201d answer. Calling you manipulative and sociopathic doesn\u2019t add up- so something must have happened to prompt that. I\u2019d want to know more about the interaction she had with your BF\u2019s mom, because things don\u2019t add up.", "NTA. A good doctor will help anyone and everyone and not chastise those in desperate times. This does not seem like a reasonable response from a good doctor for mind. Calling it your \u201cpersonal drama\u201d is wholly unnecessary. She in no way needed to chastise you for having concerns and your reaching out to a friend for advise on how to proceed during a scary and profoundly stressful time. \n\nAs a heath professional, one expects to be approached by friends and family for advice on things like this. And her response was wildly inappropriate.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to politely recommend seeking advice elsewhere in the future, but this was ludicrous in my opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You wanted one.\n\nEven if you had a primary care provider and gyn in the area, they would have likely directed you to urgent care or the ER to be assessed.\n\nBecause you did not have an urgent need and had not bothered to go through the proper channels, you caused your acquaintance to call in a favor to a colleague that was unnecessary.

And doc needs ~~help~~ therapy.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nBased on your comments, it sounds like you gave your BF\u2019s mom\u2019s friend an out, which could have easily been taken at that time, or even on the phone if she\u2019d been uncomfortable with the subject then.\n\nThe only instance where I would consider you TA, is if you frequently asked for medical advice from her.", "YTA.  Call your own doctor, not a friend of a friend.  That person doesn't know you or your history and is not involved in your care.  You did cross a huge boundary, I don't know why you would call her instead of your own physician, it's beyond reason or logic.", "YTA. Go to the hospital or emergency room.  \n\nWhy the hell would you wait and involve a third party? This isn't asking a doctor to look at a mole at a cocktail party. Which is also an AH move.", "NTA, and that text came from your boyfriend's mother, not her friend.", "YTA don't beg for free advice from someone who isn't your doctor. It's useless advice, since they don't have your file anyway. You've put her in a precarious position. If she doesn't help she gets gossip and admonished, if she does help she is liable. Just don't.\n\nEither get a doctor or go to the ER.", "YTA. Im not even a doctor, but even as someone with a PhD in a related field (medical research), I am frequently asked for medical advice. I cant imagine how high that burden is for a doctor who has been in the career for 20 years. \n\nIf you were so extremely worried you needed to go to the ER. If you wanted a specialist's opinion, then why didnt you call your old OB/GYN who know you and has medical records? They wouldnt have been able to get you an appointment, but you absolutely could have asked to talk to your old doctor or at least a nurse who would have so much more information about your situation. They could have given you better insight as to your personal risk level and whether you should go to the ER or not.\n\nHonestly, I can also see how this situation would lead the doctor to those conclusions about your personality. If you know youd be a high-risk pregnancy, then why were you and your boyfriend not using any level of protection unless you were planning for a baby? I have to assume that is not the case since you have no obgyn services established in your new area. At best, if you were trying for a child, youre showing poor judgement and planning by not already having local obgyn care established. \n\nShe likely saw someone in essentially an active mental health crisis. You were exhibiting clear anxiety in your reaction to a home pregnancy test before you even called her (Which also leads me to believe this wasnt expected. Once again, if this was planned, you needed to already have care established due to your risk level). What she sees is someone who wasnt being proactive or careful, then place their burden onto someone else and make their situation an emergency to a stranger for a situation they knew was risky and apparently didnt take sufficient steps to prevent. Add to that you seem only concerned about your well being, rather than worrying about their best friends grandchild's wellbeing. I see some red flags, id definitely warn my best friend about if I was her.\n\nSure the mom's friend could have been nicer about telling you off, but given the lack of common sense respect you showed to her boundaries, Id cut her a little slack in terms of her response. The relationship is supposed to be as a family friend, not your free on call medical professional. Giving her an update on the situation was furthering the unnecessary burden (bpth time and emotionally) that you put on her. Part of why she probably found your behavior problematic was that youre mixing her two roles. She cannot be a family friend and a doctor at the same time. Wearing both of those hats at the same time raises ethical questions. \n\nSo to summarize, you used poor judgement in your day to day life, ended up in a risky but entirely preventable situation. You let your past experienes and anxiety overtake logic, and then expected a complete stranger to do you a huge favor (that also makes her look unprofessional), while puttting her in an ethically questionable place, which you did more than once by updating her. \n\nYou could have simply waited until you spoke to the mom and gave an update through her. Please respect her boundaries from now on. At most, I would, tell the mother you feel terrible and would like to apologize.", "ESH/YTA. The panicked 12 am call was unnecessary. I understand you\u2019re scared, ectopic pregnancies are extremely dangerous. However, if you were bleeding or had any pain, you could have went to the ER. There was zero reason besides impatience and anxiety for you to be contacting to doctor friend in the middle of the night. \n\nThe doctor, could have easily referred you to someone else, told you to go to the ER, or simply not responded until morning. If she didn\u2019t want to be part of your care, she deffo could have just said that. \u2018I am unavailable at this time, you can either contact my clinic during business hours or find another specialist.\u2019 Simple. However, based on their text to you, I genuinely feel like you were being too pushy/demanding when you could have waited till morning since you were so adamant about not going to the ER despite them being able to give you the ultrasound and blood work you wanted.", "NTA. You didn't put her out.  You had reason to trust her and she had no reason to react in that vile way. I'm sorry that happened to you.  She has got to be the most unempathetic, shitty doctor in the world. Sometimes ER physicians are great, but sometimes they are not.", "INFO: did a dog eat the middle chapters to this story? I genuinely do not believe your conversation ended \u201camicably\u201d and then she eviscerated you 3 days later calling you a sociopath.", "YTA go to the ER that\u2019s what they are for.\n\n\u201cOn the other hand, I can\u2019t shake that - especially as a medical professional - she reduced my health concerns I shared with her over a risky pregnancy to drama in a 12am text. I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone.\u201d\n\nWTF. How can you even write this. SHE IS NOT YOUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. CALL YOUR OWN DOCTOR.", "NTA. I\u2019d show the messages to your bfs mom and ask if she knows what\u2019s going on, explain the previous ectopic pregnancy and that your bf told you to call her, and ask her to clarify why her friend is so upset she\u2019s name-calling the mother of her best friends grand baby.\n\nThen please update because I really wanna know!!", "NTA. This woman must have misunderstood something gigantic. As you say, perhaps she thought she had to hide it from her best friend or something. I would not be able to resist answering and would be royally pissed off honestly. You ask friends for help and advice, that's a big part of what friends are for. It wasn't like you called her up to tell her about your toe fungus, she knows the medical system there and you asked for advice. If she for real feels this strongly about the \"I'm not everyone's doctor!\" Then she should have just said \"Sorry, but I cannot comment on it as a doctor. It would probably be best you got to the er officially.\"", "YTA\n\nSo you\u2019re wondering during the call why she was so nice to you. \n\nShe was hearing you panicking on the phone, so likely she did her best to calm you and reassure. Then you followed her plan and did get reassurance. Now knowing all is well, then she sent you the text saying it was inappropriate. That makes sense because she felt burdened to take care of you when you called in the moment. \n\nDoctors are humans too. Your boyfriend making sure she was home with nothing to do (WTF) doesn\u2019t mean she wants to deal with medical issues on her time off. People do this to med folk all the time. \n\nAlso my guess is she already talked to her best friend about this and MIL doesn\u2019t like you and doesn\u2019t like that you used her best friend. It may have been MIL who wanted her to send the text.", "This is a very weird situation, but the \u201cno need to respond to this text\u201d line makes me kind of suspicious that someone else texted from her phone then deleted the message.", "NTA. She clearly shouldn\u2019t be a doctor. Holy shif???", "Info: do you know why the ER Dr friend lives with your boyfriend's mom? She may be in her own world of crisis and by asking for her help, you became something to take her bad feelings out on. \n\nYou did the best with the things you can think of. For future reference, you can call the wmergency dept yourself and talk to a nurse and give them the same info, they could have alleviated your worry and helped you decide. It isn't in their best interest to tell people who are ok to come in when it's unnecessary. They know their limitations. \n\nI understand you were working from a place of pure fear and panic. I would share the message with your boyfriend and ask if he thinks telling his mom is important.\n\nGoing forward, no matter how nice someone seems, work on finding ways to access the information you need on your own.\n\nThat woman, I would never talk to again. Holy. NTA.", " I have found the world only gets less and less sympathetic.", "Yes I have been thinking about this and how I can best go about talking with his mom and making sure I hopefully can make her feel like she can tell me if anything is on her mind bothering her about me or my actions (without throwing her friend under the bus). \n\nBefore this I haven\u2019t ever asked either of them for anything concrete other than his mom watching our dog for two nights when we went away one weekend which she seemed enthusiastic and excited about doing at the time.   \n\nOur relationship is really more like us going over there to all cook together and hang out and have wine and talk over dinner and tv shows. I\u2019ve hung out there two saturdays to watch her kids who were visiting when she got called in and I had no plans. \n\nI\u2019m scrambling to understand why she - and potentially my boyfriends mom ugh \ud83d\ude13- has that image of me. I obviously need to speak to my boyfriend\u2019s mom and really listen to any input or reactions she has before I can get anywhere productive here.", "I would also be very mindful and thoughtful of anything shared with your boyfriend\u2019s mother as well. This misguided image of you is coming from and being embraced somewhere.", "Thanks for your response, I know my reaction was irrational in many senses and while I don\u2019t have a GP/ OB set up here since my move (well now I do) I did carry over my psychiatrist for remote meetings and it\u2019s probably obvious that issues from the last pregnancy experience are a major topic I\u2019m trying to get under control and manage - albeit not well enough. Obviously \ud83d\ude10\n\nYou\u2019re definitely right that it\u2019s on me to grow up and make sure I\u2019m not in situations like this where I\u2019m reaching out in any urgent situation for help if it can be avoided. Anyways, thanks for the thought out response.", "She wanted to use her to get a referral. OP is the AH", "Only other time medical advice came up was her enthusiastically and kind of jokingly telling me in a group conversation that I should go see her friend who does hand physical therapy because my pinky finger kept popping from playing tennis or using my phone.\n\nShe\u2019s very nice usually -at least the times I\u2019ve been around the house- with helping explain stuff when anyone has a general health question or for instance i think my boyfriends mom told her I had a migraine when I first moved here and I specifically remember her asking me if I had medication for it or needed help with recommendations when I went over and first really hung out with her. \n\nNot saying her being friendly like that is grounds for \u201cok I can just bother her every time I need medical help on anything\u201d. But just some additional context for why I\u2019m confused by this harsh of a follow up to the one time I did reach out.", "And when OP indicated that she didn\u2019t want the doc to feel obligated, the doctor could have explained this and declined to grant the favor.

I do Not see how you could have possibly ruined anything. There\u2019s only two options:\n\n1. Your BF and his mom are being duplicitous with you - two faced. Seems unlikely - but please don\u2019t ignore if it\u2019s possible that Mom might have said something she didn\u2019t say to you, to her best friend?\n\n2. Best friend is unhinged. This whole reaction \u201cyou\u2019re a sociopath, lose my number\u201d is a waaayyyy overreaction to seeking someone\u2019s help for a medical issue. \n\nSo please show them the message. I would be curious what they make of it", "I can\u2019t see that you did anything wrong at all. She agreed to answer your initial request for help. Why did she flip out later? It\u2019s not unusual for people to ask for a quick bit of professional advice from a friend. Her follow-up to you seems ridiculously over the top.", "That's super weird. She sounds unstable.", "Did you call her late at night? Is there some other detail here? To me it sounds like her view is that you\u2019re over-dramatising (eg. with a history of ectopic pregnancy you do need to be assessed but if there are no current symptoms it\u2019s not something that needs dealing with this second - especially if your pregnancy is very early as there\u2019s be nothing to see on a scan). I\u2019m not saying you are - this may well be the advice given to you when you had your ectopic and you may be scared out of your mind. It sounds like something within that conversation or the context of it is what\u2019s caused this reaction but it\u2019s so difficult to say what\u2019s happened here. Clearly something has happened but I don\u2019t know which side the issue lies!", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want to deal with it she could\u2019ve just not replied, or said sorry I\u2019m off duty. She sounds nuts and was really horrible to you for no reason.", "Honestly I know this is easier said than done but I would try to care less what these two women think of you. I personally think you're NTA. What are friends and community for but to help each other when we're in need? Maybe you did freak out a little bit and it could have waited until morning or maybe you did ask too much of her in having her reach out to a colleague, but I think she could have communicated that in the moment. Or she could have communicated that without calling you a psychopath.\n\nHer response was nuclear, which leads me to believe she didn't like you much to begin with. I think in that case you should stop trying to be her friend or win her approval. Don't think too deeply on it. There will always be people who don't like you. They won't like you for reasons outside of your control. The only thing you can do is try to recognize when someone is not on your team and reflect on how to not repeat mistakes you do make.", "And a doctor or really any remotely empathetic person should have understood that.

I texted her after he told me she was not working or with patients. \n\nI think I\u2019ve covered every detail I can think of in responses throughout the comments here, but the only thing that would be strange for the her thinking I was overdramatizing angle is that at the time we spoke on Thursday, we had a really straightforward and calm conversation. \n\nI wasn\u2019t crying or upset I just informed her quickly that I had an ectopic x year with x surgery and outcome and I am pregnant now. She asked one or two questions to make sure I wasn\u2019t having symptoms and to know roughly how far along I was and then said definitely don\u2019t go to the er and that I should get in with obgyn tomorrow. \n\nUnless I\u2019ve completely lost my mind, she sounded as normal and positive / direct as ever and ended it by telling me to please call her that night if anything came up as she was on duty (at the one good hospital nearby). \n\nI got no inkling of a sense that she was frustrated, let alone thinking I\u2019m a sociopath etc. I\u2019m probably annoying people by not giving a detail that could help on this side of the situation (the angriness in that text).
