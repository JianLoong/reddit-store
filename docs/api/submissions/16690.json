I recently moved to the area my boyfriend grew up in. I do not have a doctor here yet. My boyfriend and his mom are away visiting family across the country. \n\nI am very close with his mom and have also gotten close with her best friend (F ~45) who is currently living temporarily with her locally and is an ER doctor here. \n\nOn Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls, I was debating going to the ER for testing / ultrasound (not ideal obviously but I needed to see a specialist asap). \n\nFor quick context on why I had to react quickly, I had an ectopic pregnancy a few years ago that resulted in sudden internal bleeding and a near death emergency surgery. I am very high risk for another one.\n\nSo, after discussing with my boyfriend and taking his advice, I called the friend of his mom who was home and off-duty.\n\nI explained my situation very directly and calmly and asked for her direction. \n\nShe told me to not rush to an ER and gave a referral for the next day. I expressed how appreciative I was. She said call if anything came up that evening, and the conversation ended amicably. \n\nFast forward 3 days. I receive a text at 12am from her. Here it is with some redactions for privacy:\n\n\u201cI feel that it is necessary that I make you aware of a few things. I feel that it was wholly inappropriate that you involve me in your personal drama.\n\nX (boyfriend\u2019s mom) is my best friend. I was placed in a no win situation by a person who clearly doesn\u2019t understand boundaries. A person who relies on the fact that people are kind and accommodating even when their personal comfort is compromised. The sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act is just that\u2014 an act. \n\nWhat I see is a subversive manipulative sociopathic person who had to go out of her way to ruin X\u2019s vacation. And you used me to do it. Because you clearly have issues with boundaries I\u2019m going to make this crystal clear. I am not interested in any further interaction with you. The Dr (her last name) free clinic is closed  You have crossed a line and I do not want to be saddled with your issues medical or otherwise. There is no need to respond to this text.\u201d\n\nWhile calling her was a difficult choice and my last resort, the more I\u2019ve sat on the text message, the more I\u2019ve started to think I am the asshole for not considering further the position I was putting her in. I can see how she felt I overstepped given her friendship with X. I spoke with X on my own on Friday, but that\u2019s irrelevant here.\n\nOn the other hand, I can\u2019t shake that - especially as a medical professional - she reduced my health concerns I shared with her over a risky pregnancy to drama in a 12am text. I know I was asking a huge favor, but i thought in the moment it was the best option in a tough situation where I was alone. \n\nAITA for involving someone - who I now very clearly know didn\u2019t want to be involved - in my pregnancy situation?", "created_utc": 1683533823, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bicmc/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriends_moms_best_friend/", "score": 71, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cause there is no world where a doctor would react like that if a high risk patient just asks for a medical advice?", "INFO Based on what's written here, I'm inclined towards N T A. But I can't help but feel something is missing. While a doctor may not like giving out advice while not in duty, that reaction, especially the personal verbal attack, is over the top. Either relevant context is missing  and the doctor did a good job at hiding how she felt over the phone, only expressing herself a few days later, or something happened in the 3 days after related to OP that changes how the doctor  thought.  Without knowing why I'm not comfortable giving judgment.", "I feel like there is a HUGE chunk of information missing here.", "There seems to be some info missing here. I understand that you did a test and found out you were pregnant. And that you know that you\u2019re at high-risk for a second ectopic pregnancy. But I don\u2019t understand who the \u201ccountless unanswered calls\u201d were placed to or why? Or what symptoms you were having that caused you to \u201cneed a specialist asap\u201d? And the level of hostility in the doctor\u2019s message suggests that she believes you to be, at minimum, a manipulative person. \n\nBottom Line: If you were cramping, bleeding, or in pain, then you should have called an ambulance and gone to the ER immediately. \nIf you were not having any symptoms, but were fearful because of your last pregnancy, then you needed to do something to calm down- call your bf, call a friend and talk to them. Neither of these required you to call a doctor you did not know for advice. ESH. \n\nEdits: clarity.", "I\u2019m getting the feeling something else happened. Did you harass the doctor? This is not something someone would send from 1 concerned phone call.", "YTA. you didnt ask for advice, you asked for a referral. Totally different and you're burying the lede. She's right to text you setting a firm boundary, you basically used your relationship with her to get her to work for free because you didnt want to listen to the advice youd already been given by ER", "YTA.\n\n'Emergency department just told me to come into the emergency department. Which I was hoping to avoid by making an appointment for Friday with an Obgyn.\n\nI asked the friend for a big favor/help referring me to an Obgyn that could see me before the weekend.'\n\nYou didn't call her for advice; you called for a favour because you wanted a referral. You didn't want to follow ERs advice. That did put her in an uncomfortable position; to her credit, she helped you, but I can absolutely see why she feels her boundaries were stomped over here. I think her text to you was spot on and you do need to reflect on this behaviour. I wouldn't even phone one of my best friends asking them to do something like this for me.", "ESH, with qualifiers. Medical people work hard enough without being consulted by every acquaintance. I can understand them having firm boundaries, and I can understand people pushing those boundaries in emergencies.\n\nSo I was kinda leaving towards you being slightly socially the A, in an understandable, sometimes-you-gotta-be-the-asshole kind of way. But, unless you've left out a bunch of drama, the message you received is pretty unnecessarily vicious. I guess she was just lashing out because she didn't feel able to say no at the time. I'd shrug your shoulders and just leave it.", "YTA. per the comments, you had already decided not to go to the ER and wanted a referral stat, so decided to pull a 'friend' card to get that. I can understand why you did it in prioritizing yourself and your health, but not sure why you're surprised about the off-duty doctor acquaintance feeling inappropriately used. i mean, maybe its her fault too for not just saying 'sorry, can't help' immediately when you called, since this is def worse for her to follow up with the resentment after the fact. but you did sort of put her on the spot to get what you wanted. are there past interactions that would lead her to see this as a pattern of playing-innocent-but-being-manipulative character? her text definitely seems freighted with more than just this itneraction", "You could have still called your other prior doctor foe advice even if not living around there anymore. If u just found out you were  newly pregnant Thursday, what symptoms were you having that made you feel you need to rule out an ectopic pregnancy in ER on the same wkend? The baby has to be far enough along growing in the tube to be medical emergency when the tube could rupture\u2026 \nSomething is missing in your story OP. Based on the response you got I am guessing this isn\u2019t your first rodeo with overreactions.", ">On Thursday evening, after countless unanswered calls\n\nIn the comments, you said you called her once. Who did you call countless times? I feel like there is important pertinent information missing here, and you did put this ER doctor in an awkward situation. If you felt you emergently needed tests, you should have checked yourself into the ER. It sounds like you were nervous due to your medical history, but that burden should not be put on a family friend on her day off just because of her profession, and you should have sought care through the appropriate channels.", "YTA \n\nCome on - you know it was wildly inappropriate to phone an off duty ER doctor with your concerns.   You just do not do that \n\nIt could and it did wait until the next day \n\nHowever the doctor is also an AH.  That was also a wildly inappropriate and over the top message \n\nI can only say she is probably massively over worked saving lives and was on her last nerve getting a call in her down time from you", "YTA. She\u2019s not your doctor, not even an ObGYN so it was not really appropriate to approach her in a work capacity in this way at midnight. Also it may have been that she thought you were trying to involve her in a potential deliberation over an abortion of what would be her best friend\u2019s grandchild", "So you basically told your BF's mom's best friend that he was going to be a father before anyone told his mom.  And because you did that outside of a professional setting, you put her in a really bad position, because even though your request was personal, she was restrained by professional standards from telling his mother or even addressing it with you in the middle of her free consult.\n\nAnd she very well may have gotten grief from her best friend for knowing she was going to have a grandchild and not immediately telling her.\n\nAll that is before the fact that medical professionals frequently deal with people looking for free advice or even examination and it gets very old for them, very fast.\n\nYou were an AH for putting her in that position.  She was an AH for the level of vitriol in her text (and at midnight, too--I have to wonder if alcohol may have been involved).\n\nESH", "YTA", "ESH. Eh, I'm going to go with everybody sucking in various ways.\n\nI think OP acted in a kind of immature and panicky way. It is kind of all over the place... on the one hand, disregarding the ER's recommendation to come in, but still expecting on-demand service from this off-call doctor; getting all angsty about the mere hypothetical possibility of another ectopic pregnancy, when even those don't grow in mere hours; insisting on needing a referral right away, but not willing to go thru normal avenues to get it. Most probably this positive preg test could have probably just been handled in ER, urgent care that night, or Fri morning call to providers .  So honestly, I probably the doctor's resentment is partially born of impatience with the larger factors of age etc. In my experience, people thought my young-woman anxiety was sympathetic until about age 25, and then it all but evaporated oncepregnancy and kids were in the picture... then if I didn't have stuff lined up like my own GP/OBGYN or pediatrician for the kids or was still asking for favors/rides to save money, people were just like 'wut is wrong with you, get your shit together. your disorganization or cost-saving efforts are not my emergency'. it was harsh, but i did need to grow up a bit. it is precisely these kinds of adult things that make you resilient and eventually able to handle stuff calmly. i don't know that that's necessarily what's going on with OP, but the content of the text suggests the doctor-acquaintance at least perceives OP as using little-girl anxiety drama in life or using it to get people's help. Unfortunately, as I have gotten older, especially if a middle-aged or olde woman responsible for kids, I have found the world only gets less and less sympathetic.\n\nAt the same time, this doctor seems to have kind of blown a gasket, or let this interaction get to her head in a weird way too. why didn't she just draw the boundaryto begin with and say, no, i'm not your doctor? and why did she tell the friend/BF's mom if she knew it was going to create drama during her trip? and why was she still stewing on this days later and texting angrily at midnight. so it sounds like she has maturity/boundary issues too. If she doesn't want to offer free services to acquaintances, then she should have shut it down right away, rather than giving the referall and then stewing with resentment over it.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s completely normal to reach out to a doctor friend. I understand the doctor could have felt that she was put in a difficult situation. I\u2019m unsure whether hipaa would actually cover this situation if you reached out as a friend BUT she could always have used it as cover for keeping your medical questions secret. If she spoke to boyfriends mom after the referral to OB then she certainly violated hipaa laws. \nI\u2019m concerned for you what a conversation between boyfriends mom and best friend looked like if that\u2019s the response you got.", "That's really fkn weird and there is absolutely a reason why she reacted in that way. I'm not sure why.. so it's hard to comment on this situation. But if you see no reason why she would react in that way, I don't see how you're in the wrong at all. I think what you did was perfectly fine. If there aren't any issues between you two then maybe she has been taken advantage of a lot in the past so reacted that way because of that.", "I don\u2019t fully understand her issue but her text is incredibly cruel so for that reason, NTA. \u201cThe sweet unassuming innocuous helpless little girl act\u2026\u201d I mean wow. Talk about a lack of empathy. Obviously she\u2019s not obligated to give you medical advice but she\u2019s 45, she should know how to set boundaries. Everyone I know who works in the medical field sets that boundary with friends and family, it\u2019s a necessary skill set.", "I would just reply \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I over stepped your boundaries, it wasn\u2019t deliberate, and it won\u2019t happen again. Thank you for your help.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t do anything to escalate this drama.  \n\nNTA", "NTA, I get that doctors don't want to constantly be asked their medical opinions in their free time, but you were in a difficult situation and just wanted advice how to proceed.\nHer response is a complete overreaction and I don't get it at all. How did you put her in a difficult situation, how did you strain her relationship with X, how did you ruin her vacation? Her calling you manipulative and sociopathic was completely uncalled for.", "NTA. Furthermore, I would never have any interaction with this person again for two reasons: \n1.  She clearly said she wants nothing to do with you. \n2. Your actions in the past (this situation included) have been misconstrued and she has formed an opinion of you without ever asking questions to clarify and/or justify or disarm her thoughts of you. \n\nI would also be very mindful and thoughtful of anything shared with your boyfriend\u2019s mother as well. This misguided image of you is coming from and being embraced somewhere.  \n\nI wish you and your boyfriend the best in your pregnancy. You will have enough to worry about and this should be a joyous occasion and moment in your life. To hell with her and whatever misguided image she has of you.", "[deleted]", "could it be possible that she got in any trouble at her actual job for giving advice \u201coff the clock\u201d? or was told by her higher ups that she needed to remain professional and she was just trying to set a boundary? idk the language from her message was way too formal + aggressive. i also feel like something is missing", "NTA. \n\nThough there seem to be something else going on. Insinuating the news of your pregnancy would ruin BF's mother's vacation and saying your situation was a manipulated drama. That's really insulting and seems to step of from some other repressed issues. \n\nInfo: Did you have any issues prior to this with either of them?", "You asked a medical question and she responded. She doesn't want to treat you due to her relationship with your MIL, thats fine. But no way in hell is she, as a medical professional, allowed to pass your medical information to a third party. Friend or not. Her proffesionality does not change because she knows mil or you. She put herself in a difficult position, not you. If she is not comfortable being part of your medical treatment than she is allowed to state that, but she needs to learn to communicate properly cause this isn't it.", "NTA. This doesn\u2019t even make sense- if she was uncomfortable helping you should could have simply told you to go to the emergency room- just as every single on-call nurse tells anyone who calls them for like every problem ever- it\u2019s the standard \u201cI don\u2019t want to be responsible for your health\u201d answer. Calling you manipulative and sociopathic doesn\u2019t add up- so something must have happened to prompt that. I\u2019d want to know more about the interaction she had with your BF\u2019s mom, because things don\u2019t add up.", "NTA. A good doctor will help anyone and everyone and not chastise those in desperate times. This does not seem like a reasonable response from a good doctor for mind. Calling it your \u201cpersonal drama\u201d is wholly unnecessary. She in no way needed to chastise you for having concerns and your reaching out to a friend for advise on how to proceed during a scary and profoundly stressful time. \n\nAs a heath professional, one expects to be approached by friends and family for advice on things like this. And her response was wildly inappropriate.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to politely recommend seeking advice elsewhere in the future, but this was ludicrous in my opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The only people who could actually do anything anyways would be the ER doctors, since it\u2019s not like an off-duty doctor of a random specialty could actually do anything for you in the event of an ectopic crisis over the phone.

Interesting and helpful clarification. So it was only THurs and  you actually could have called in the morning on Fri probably, it wasn't yet the weekend. I misudnerstood earlier and thought it was Fri night already.\n\nAnyways, gIven this abrupt shift from her initial willingness to her later angry text,  I can only think that it's something related to the pregnancy-specific nature of all this and the relationship she has with the mom/bf.  After all, she didn't know ahead of time from your text what the medical issue was or how urgent it was/wasn't... so she may have agreed too hastily thinking it was just about you and not realizing how complex and relevant to these other relatinoships the issue actually was.  And then afterwards realized it was probably not appropriate for you two to have talked about it, or got blow-back from the BFs mother for some reason, or began to feel used after realizing it wasn't actually that urgent to involve her. I am not sure how she could have anticipated or forestalled the conversation not knowing the content of what you were going to raise.

You\u2019d already been told by the ER to come in, but had yourself decided to disregard that. So then instead of calling your GP after-hours line or going to an Urgent Care for a referral to OBGYN, it seemed cheaper to call a random off-duty non-specialist for a referral.\n\nAll in all, it seems pretty clear. You were feeling in a pinch and used her because you wanted referral service fast without paying for it.  She gave you the referral you wanted, but resents being put in that position especially because of her personal connections to the family. There is a logic on both sides I guess.", "So you werent asking her for medical advice, you were asking her for a favor?

You called an acquaintance for something that was not an emergency to get them to pull strings for you so you could have special treatment.\n\nThe appropriate action was to go to an urgent care or walk in clinic. They would have run or referred you to have the necessary tests. You did not need an OBGYN for this. You wanted one.\n\nEven if you had a primary care provider and gyn in the area, they would have likely directed you to urgent care or the ER to be assessed.\n\nBecause you did not have an urgent need and had not bothered to go through the proper channels, you caused your acquaintance to call in a favor to a colleague that was unnecessary. This could damage her professional relationships.\n\nYou inconvenienced two doctors for a positive pregnancy test.", "Ahhh ok we're getting closer to the issue then.\n\nSort of. \n\nI do think treating someone like a free doctor isn't ideal, especially when you apparently *did* have other options.\n\nBut that doesn't really explain why she called you sociopathic so I'm still lost.

Was she harsh, yes and calling you sociopathic is frankly weird and seems to say there is some missing info there, but you put her in a really awkward position. \n\nYou had another option and you chose not to pursue it. \n\nWhere I am from doctors are highly frowned on if they treat friends / family- it's considered unethical and can put them under a microscope. \n\nYou also don't know how often she is asked for just a referral, just a diagnosis, just some advice, or dealing with yet another emergency when she is finished work and trying to switch off. It's exhausting, happens constantly and every doctor I know is uncomfortable with it for multiple reasons... What if she gave you the 'wrong' advice? Which is easy when someone doesn't have access to your medical records, hasnt examined you, and you're asking them for medical direction. Relationships would be ruined in all directions.\n\nYou have my sympathy as I know how horrible an ectopic can be and clearly you were alone and panicking, but you handled this poorly.\n\nAll the best for the rest of the pregnancy.", "Well, I understand what your opinion on my situation is and respect it / appreciate the feedback.

I clearly didn\u2019t handle it perfectly and won\u2019t call a doctor who is a friend again regardless of the situation. \n\nMore importantly congrats on the pregnancy, I am sure that is extremely exciting especially after what you\u2019ve been through, and I hope the best for you and your baby.", "Sheesh you said you were done I thought \ud83d\ude33 but hi again. \n\nI do not have a GP here yet, of course I would have called them if I did. \n\nYes, I was in distress over whether to go to the ER that night or not\u2026 it was feeling like the only option before the weekend if I couldn\u2019t see an obgyn. The friend asked me on the phone about symptoms and reassured me that wasn\u2019t necessary and getting in with a good obgyn the next day was the right thing to do. She then gave a referral in the next 10 minutes, which was a huge favor. \n\nWhen you call an emergency department, they don\u2019t give any medical advice.. they say you can come in if you need to and be assessed. I wasn\u2019t trying to say they said \u201cok yeah call 911 come in\u201d. \n\nAnd you keep mentioning urgent care. I felt my odds of getting a Friday last minute appointment  in a niche area on a Thursday night was much more likely going to happen through a doctor who knows me personally and is maybe willing to make a call to another doctor they know.

I\u2019d love to know what the hell prompted that response.", "interesting theory about the drinking or something along those lines", "Yes of course re: the ER being where one goes immediately when an ectopic pregnancy has burst (like my first pregnancy). \n\nI knew I wasn\u2019t dealing with a burst ectopic pregnancy Thursday evening.

It seems like I was definitely the asshole for calling her, which I already assumed was the case, but she was nothing but receptive to my outreach at the time and was the one who offered referring me to a peer near the end of our call. \n\nThat\u2019s why I am baffled by the 12am text three days later that had so much hate in it. Not saying she\u2019s an asshole at all, I guess there\u2019s either something I have really missed from the last three days or she was just bottling that up since my initial text to her Thursday and let it out after the fact.", "You and me both \ud83d\ude13 If there were details that helped explain that text beyond the Thursday interaction, I\u2019d offer them up. Feel like a bad human reading how much hate she obviously feels towards me and stuck since she said \u201cdon\u2019t respond\u201d. I am not going to disrespect that request clearly. \n\nMaybe it is simply that I way overstepped by reaching out and she is stressed and that\u2019s her way of communicating her feelings on the matter. Maybe she has hated me since she met me and never showed signs and this triggered it all to come out. Will update if/ when I am able to get clarity."]}
