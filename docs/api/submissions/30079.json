It was was the first time the boys have been left home alone overnight. They turn 18 in January.\n\nI got back to find the house cleaner than it was when I left and we now have a new toaster. Obviously, something happened.\n\nI got back on my birthday so my brother came round and we had a meal together. I noticed the new toaster and called the boys into the kitchen. I cannot remember exactly what I said down to the word but it was, as best I remember I put my hand on the toaster and said \"We all know you've done something, and whatever happened, you've clearly tried to fix it. Now, if anybody ended up in a police station or a hospital and I find out from someone that isn't either of you, there will be hell to pay. If one or both of you want to tell me what went down, we're good.\" My brother asked what that was all about, so I explained it was all suspiciously clean and the toaster was new.\n\nI'm still not sure what they've done. On a more detailed inspection, the old toaster isn't anywhere to be seen, nothing is missing from the first aid supplies and there isn't anything else amiss. What little alcohol there was is still there. Neither boy has hinted at what happened and I have not really probed.\n\nThey have done whatever they did, then fixed it. In a matter of months they will be adults and although I would like to know, I am not sure I see the justification in punishing them for not telling me. They spent their own money on a new toaster after doing god knows what to the old one, and cleaned the house after their escapade.\n\nMy brother thinks I am the asshole for, in his words, letting them get away with it. As adults, they will be fixing their own problems which is what they have just done so I think letting this one slide is fine.\n\nThey are very aware I know something happened, so they have not totally pulled the wool over my eyes. However, whatever went down over those few days has been sorted by the people who did it, so I think it is problem solved and we can all move on.\n\nMy brother has spoken to his wife and our parents and everyone thinks I am the asshole for refusing to punish the boys for not coming clean about what happened. I have spoken to them again and said if there is anything broken they have tried to fix rather than replace, to tell me so I can make sure it has been fixed in a safe way. They insist the only thing that needed to be sorted was the toaster. I still think it is problem done and dusted, but I am the only one who thinks I am not the asshole here.\n\nAm I the asshole for not punishing the twins for refusing to say what happened, given they fixed it?\n\nEDIT - I do not suspect a party, they are not party lads. I suspect one or both stuck something in there they shouldn't have done. One has a bit of a perfectionist streak so a guilt-clean of some kind does make some sense. I'm not really buying a party though, not for these boys.\n\nSEE UPDATE COMMENT ", "created_utc": 1698805792, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17l25jv/aita_for_refusing_to_punish_my_sons_when_i_know/", "score": 243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I won't punish the boys. After thinking it over for several hours, they have decided to fess up. Fake names used. \n\nAlex spilt soup over the counter. As a liquid, it of course went everywhere and in the de-souping, things were moved around to wipe it all up. Not everything was put back in the right place. The next day, they decide the make pasta for lunch. The toaster had plastic-y sides and was put back really close to the hob. The heat was turned up high to cook the pasta and they leave it unattended as it takes a few minutes to cook. I am not sure there has been full honesty on how long they left it but I'm not pushing it. The side of the toaster was essentially melted. Ben then remembers the fairly common British air freshener adverts about smells being absorbed by soft furnishings. Both decide this means the smell of burnt plastic will \"soak in\" and give the game away. I'm back in that evening. Cue teen panic. \n\nToaster gets flung in the nearest public bin, new one is bought at the nearest shop that sells toasters (the supermarket 20 minutes away) and the cleaning begins. \n\nWhen I was very young, my mother caused a fire by leaving a chip pan unattended and this perhaps had more of an impact on me than I have ever realized. Alex and Ben decided to not tell me they'd left the pasta unattended and melted the toaster, as they thought I'd be so scared they'd almost set the house and / or themselves on fire that I'd never let them cook ever again. \n\nLessons learnt all round. The clear space round the hob is not a stylistic choice, burning plastic smells horrific, the hob perhaps doesn't need to be up quite that high, Nanna and chip pans are a bad combination and I quite possibly need a therapist because it clearly left a much deeper mark than I have ever realized but has rubbed off on the boys.", "NTA and I don\u2019t get your family\u2019s problem. Punishments are to teach consequences right? For example if you throw a party and someone breaks the toaster, you would have to clean up after the party and replace the toaster. Which they did. Of their own accord. Because you raised them right.\n\nHonestly nice one, your sons know how to clean up after themselves and fix their mistakes so you\u2019ve clearly been teaching them something. You did your bit as the parent of young adults by setting a limit (police or injury), doing some checks (first aid, alcohol, rest of house) and checking in again. You\u2019ve given them reasonable responsibility for their age and honestly what punishment can you give them that isn\u2019t just for the sake of punishing them? Stand firm OP!", "NTA  \nWhatever they did, they recognized their screw-up and fixed it, with their own money.\n\nSo long as they're not in legal trouble, not telling you what they did is perfectly fine.\n\nFrom a purely speculative point, I think they tried what I did, putting cheese slices on bread and laying the toaster on its side to make a grilled cheese.\n\nTook forever to get rid of the burning smell.", "NTA. \n\nPunishments teach some responsibility, and whatever needed to be handled they \"punished\" themselves into solving the problem and cleaning up after themselves. Sounds like they handled their own punishment.", "NTA. Everyone survived. They exhibited problem solving and teamwork. Someday they\u2019ll probably admit what happened and you\u2019ll laugh. Everyone else can pound sand.", "NTA, unless the kids had a history of causing problems I dont see why you cant give them the benefit of the doubt.", "I was literally just reading the story where the 16yo trashed the house when OP left to go away and friends caused almost $5k worth of damage and left the place a pigsty.   The kid hadn't even bothered to clean up.\n\nIn stark contrast, your kids cleaned the house and replaced the toaster.  You can always ask them what happened, which most parents would have done.  But to be punish them?  I'm not really sure how you would punish them and on what basis.", "NTA\n\nI would be doing the same thing with my kids (17M and 15F). My kids are pretty honest with my husband and I, they\u2019ve both called me or their dad when they\u2019ve fucked up or are in a situation they aren\u2019t comfortable with and needed help so we trust them the way you seem to trust your boys.\n\nThat said, I\u2019d also be like \u201cOK, I 1000% promise you won\u2019t get in trouble or grounded because you fixed whatever went down and I appreciate that you spent your money to replace what was damaged, but I\u2019m an idiot and can\u2019t work out what happened so please tell me because it is driving me insane!\u201d", "NTA. Other than the toaster, there appears to be no property damage and no one was hurt.

Your brother is the asshole, a massive one. He needs to stay in his lane!! What an interfering control freak trying to shame you into running your house his way!", "NTA. \n\nThey cleaned up their mess and replaced the broken item. They stepped up and fixed whatever it is they did. \n\nAs long as no one was hurt, sounds like they did exactly what we would expect adults to do. Why would you punish them for being responsible (even if a dumb decision was made along the way)?", "At worst, they had a party and cleaned up after. This is something my brother would do. \n\nAt best, they put something in the toaster that they shouldn't, or left it in there longer than they should, broke the toaster, ans replaced it. This is absolutely something I would do, and I'd be embarrassed as hell about it. \n\nYou can't just punish them arbitrarily, because how can you make the punishment fit if you don't know what it was. \nAlso it's absolutely no one's business but yours. Not your brother, not your SIL, and not your parents.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- they did something but cleaned up and replaced the toaster too. Nice kids. The kind you can see turning into good adults who own their actions.  \n\nAsk them again in like 2 years and they'll tell you.", "I remember around that age I would occasionally just buy stuff for the house. I saw an under the counter electric can opener that I just bought and installed without asking or telling anyone. My Mom still uses it.\n\nIf my Mother came at me with the same level of suspicion I'd be deeply hurt.\n\nAnd really punish them for what? You have nothing to punish them for! The house was cleaned, the booze was there and you got a new toaster!\n\nMy personal opinion is that as long as no one was hurt, the house wasn't destroyed, it should be fine. This isn't like that other post where some asshole kid destroyed close to $5,000.00 worth of stuff and left it trashed.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis reminds me of the [video](https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/wqakj6/throwing_a_party/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) of a group of teenagers that threw a party and ended up with a person sized hole in the wall.\n\nKid and all his friends went out and fixed it. Couldn\u2019t even tell it was ever damaged by the time they were done with it.", "NTA. \n\nNothing is wrong, nothing is broken, nobody is hurt. \n\nWhatever they did (to the old toaster), they sorted out by getting a replacement, and all is good. \n\nAt some point you'll have to just laugh and give them kudos for fixing what they fucked up, and at some point they'll laugh and tell you what they did.", "Not the asshole. You\u2019re the parent, not your brother or his wife, not your parents. You get to decide whether to discipline your own children or not, and to what extent.", "NTA. Huzzah to you. You\u2019re a good parent, treating them like adults. Whatever the situation was that happened, they clearly didn\u2019t kill anyone and (assumedly) they fixed their mistake(s). That\u2019s like what a parent is supposed to teach their children. \n\nSo, arriving home to a clean house after your kids undoubtedly threw a party, you couldn\u2019t ask for a better outcome. There\u2019s nothing to punish them for unless you had an emotional attachment to your toaster. Your brother and family are stirring up trouble, don\u2019t let him second guess your instincts.", "How DARE you choose to parent your older teens in such a nonchalant manner. You want them to be COMFORTABLE handling their own business?! Preposterous. NTA. If it was good they'll tell you over a beer when they're older.", "NTA. You have free reign how to parent them. They literally left the house CLEANER than when you left. That\u2019s unheard of from teenagers. Take the win! \n\nThey probably put something they weren\u2019t supposed to in the old toaster and the food in it exploded. \n\nOr they threw a mild party and the toaster fell off the counter. Nothing bad happened clearly: the house isn\u2019t trashed and alcohol isn\u2019t missing per your comment about the wine bottles. Not to mention you haven\u2019t gotten a call and a visit from the cops yet or other parents. \n\nMy money is they put something in the toaster they weren\u2019t supposed to and fried it.", "NTA. They very apparently paid for their mischief by having to replace the toaster.

They probably just did something dumb like put something they shouldn\u2019t have in the toaster and it melted to crap. \n\nNTA. Your house wasn\u2019t burned down and it was clean, and hey new toaster. Seems like a win.", "Maybe they stuck a raw steak in the toaster trying to do something dumb and ended up chucking it out and buying a new one eh. I would wanna know what happens just out of pure curiosity", "NTA, you don\u2019t even know what it is? If they\u2019d not sorted it out, I can see punishing them. I love twins.", "NTA - Parents don't have to follow due process, but there is nothing to punish.

If the only evidence you've found was that they cleaned and bought a toaster, consider yourself lucky.", "They cleaned up their mess, and you got a new toaster. But, I would not forget to tell that they will eventually tell you. Like most kids, they will be talking to others and I\u2019m sure this will be mentioned.

I hope that in the future at some point you and the kids will share a hilarious moment when they feel it could be a funny memory story to share.", "Nta", "NTA seriously that was they\u2019re first night on their own and in only cost a toaster and not the whole house?? They probably tried to make cheese toast in it and it got ruined.", "NTA\n\nThey're probably embarrassed and in 30 years the story will come out. I'd let it go, too.\n\nThey cleaned up, and replaced what was broken. Sounds pretty responsible to me.", "Nta. I had an experience like this when my kids were young. One did something and the other is covering for it. Don't know which one or what. They promised to tell me on my death bed. To give me something to look forward to if I get an incurable disease. Because 20 years later... I'm still curious.", " NTA but is it really common these days to not leave kids for the weekend until they are 17?  I was 12 and  brother 11 when we first spent the weekend alone.  This was years ago but still.", "NTA - Your respecting that 'control' is less important than trust and respect. IF its something truly serious you're increasing the chances of them telling you by being chill about things. \"Grounded because you did *something*\" is uselessly arbitrary.\n\nAnd now this would *not* be a good idea parenting wise, but I want to know what happened with the toaster so i'll suggest you BRIBE them for the truth so we can all know what toaster shenanigans happened.", "Considering your parenting style lead them to clean up their own mistake and pay for damages without being asked or told, I say you are doing a great job already.\n\nNta", "So you should punish them for something they did when you don't know what they did.\n\nI mean how to measure a punishment that is a learning lesson and not just punitive?  How can you KNOW what is an appropriate measure of punishment?\n\nI mean wild party---weeks/months? grounding??\n\nBroke the toaster and paid to fix it--Does that deserve punishment?  I mean the fixed the problem.  Yeah I get that sticking something inappropriate in could be dangerous(ie knife while plugged in). \n\nCan you get some truth serum(/veritaserum?) so that you can get them to tell you when they clearly don't want to?\n\nI really don't see how punishing them when they are 18 in 2ish months is going to be productive.\n\nMind, eventually(in a decade or so) they probably tell you,  Can you keep this account active so you can update us when that happens\\[wink\\]", "Nta.  Something happened and they fixed it, as adults should do.  There's nothing here to punish.", "YWBTA if you punished them.  You've checked the obvious things and nothing is out of place.  The only thing you know for sure is they decided to buy a new toaster.  Unless you get new information nothing else needs to be done.", "Did you make sure they didn\u2019t fill up the alcohol bottles with water? They probably had some sort of party and just provided their own stuff and kept it low key enough where nothing was destroyed (except the toaster) and just cleaned up the house after. Boys will be boys! NTA.", "NTA. This is excellent parenting in my book. You're treating your nearly-adult children like adults, allowing them to clean up their mistakes, and not shaming them for making mistakes that they were willing to clean up.\n\nThey took responsibility for their actions by replacing the toaster, and I worry they would find it cruel if you forced them to tell you something they clearly already feel ashamed about.\n\nKeep being a great Dad!", "INFO: did you ask them to explain why there was a new toaster?", "YWBTA if you punished them, you have absolutely no proof that anything happened other than a toaster potentially got broken and you have a nice new toaster.", "NTA - but I do think adults or not, there should be a degree of honesty in the house. Whatever happened, happened and as the person who owns the house you should be told what occurred within it, especially as you only left them alone because you trusted them. It is dishonest of them to keep the truth from you.", "NTA because it would be really hard to find a fitting punishment for a crime no one will acknowledge and by this time, there is no way the twins haven't come up with a few reasonable cover stories in case you ask again.", "So this could be one of three things that happened.\n\n1. They had a raging party and the toaster got broken while you were gone.  They then hid the evidence because they don\u2019t want to get caught.\n\n2. They accidentally broke the toaster themselves and decided to replace it. Also out of guilt cleaned the house for you.\n\n3. You mention they were alone while you were on a business trip. That seems to indicate you are the only parent.  It could be that the toaster was something that was from the days of when their other parent was around and doesn\u2019t work propely. So out of respect to you they got the toaster and cleaned the house to be nice.  However since they are boys they may feel uncomfortable admitting they did something nice.\n\n\nSince based on information you have and what you provided. NTA you don\u2019t really have any proof of wrongdoing that couldn\u2019t also just be an act of kindness or an accident.", "Lmao, this is the first time your kids have been left home alone and they\u2019re almost adults??", "the sitch is still concerning to me. if it was a minor thing, why won't they just tell you? because they refuse to tell you, you can't even be sure there isn't a lawsuit in your future. if you have offered them a free pass and they still won't tell you i guarantee it's something you need to know. typically that would be accomplished by punishing them with increasing severity until you can get the facts and have them independently confirmed. 17 year old boys get into a lot of stuff and some of it has been known to happen with 13 year old girls. they also get in groups and strut and scratch and sometimes people get hurt and have long term issues from the injury. if you, as a parent, haven't considered these possibilities (it wouldn't even have to be one of your boys that did the thing. maybe one of their friends who was over) along with a myriad of others not mentioned then your intelligence is suspect and you need to take minute to consider before you just call them grown. if you have considered these possibilities and more yet still refuse to punish them until you are clear on what went down you deserve whatever legal or social fallout, financial burden or prison time you get for their actions. you are allowing them to hide from any consequences they may deserve just because you weren't greeted with an active disaster when you got home. do better.", "YTA.\n\nWhat the other posters are missing is that what your sons \"fixed\" is covering up what they did wrong. \n\nAs an extreme example, you don't \"fix\" a murder by shooting the witnesses too.\n\nWhat you're saying is you don't think whatever they did was actually wrong, which seems like a fairly extreme statement since you don't even know if they know what all happened at your house while you were gone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Everything in the fridge was still pushed to the back from where the small beer keg was. 7 years later my younger  sister had a party and they all chipped in and hired actual cleaners.

The reason your question was whether something illegal happened or someone got hurt is because that's ultimately going to be one of the major determinants of if your sons do wrong as adults, because for the most part there isn't going to be somebody spitting down their neck for breaking household rules as the rules will be largely something they or they **and** another determined together. As such, it's pointless to ground them and just stinks of punishing them to punish them.\n\n>My brother has spoken to his wife and our parents and everyone thinks I am the asshole for refusing to punish the boys for not coming clean about what happened.\n\nWhy in the fresh fuck is it your brother, his wife, or your parents business? Why are they even calling you an asshole over this. That's a rather rude way of critiquing a parent for not punishing their kids when no one was personally hurt by their actions.

One or the other thought they'd broken it and they just panicked. Now that would be a funny story for me at least.", "When I was a kid, my older siblings and I were left alone for an afternoon. There was a wrestling match and a hole got knocked out in the wall. Not a big hole, but noticeable. There was a painting on the wall and we moved it over 6 inches to cover the hole. We were waiting for our parents to notice, but they never did and we forgot about it. Fifteen years later they were moving and found the hole\u2026 that was an interesting phone call but my dad thought it was hilarious, after he finished patching the hole for the new owners.", "Though honestly, if that was all they should just admit it and have the laugh now. Obviously OP has a good enough sense of humor that they\u2019d say the stress and cleanup was punishment enough.", "One time as a kid, I was a basketball practice and I overheard a parent talking about how their son puts butter on the bread before putting in the toaster, they could\u2019ve done that.", "My guess is they tried some shit with the sideways toaster like on Tiktok and it went horribly -- as it most likely would given that toasters are not supposed to be used sideways lol", "Tea has been spilt - see update comment. Toaster was moved and left too close to an unattended hob. The plastic side melted.", "I like using the cross thru when I need to make a correction like: ~~reign~~ rein  \n\nThat way readers can see what caused the comments, but you acknowledge the necessary correction.", "The OP is clear that he knows they did something wrong. The only question is the scale.\n\nCovering up crimes isn't a trait you should be rewarding in your kids unless they're actually fixing them, which he can't know without finding out what happened.", "If those are the only problems, the issue is OP's communication with his kids.", "You don't know if a teenage girl was raped in your house. Or if she was fed alcohol there, since they knew they'd be safe, and taken somewhere else.", "OP lists evidence of damage.", "Well not really as he asked them what went down and they are refusing to answer. So they are lying as they know what happened and won\u2019t tell him. \nI think it\u2019s pretty reasonable to punish them for not being truthful. He already told them they won\u2019t be in trouble if no one was hurt and the cops aren\u2019t involved.", "So if your toaster broke you\u2019d replace it and refuse to tell anyone in your household why you replaced it? Lol", "He actually does have proof that something happened. It's the lack of proof that was conspicuous.", "They are not really party lads, I don't suspect a party. They may have tried to toast something that shouldn't have been toasted and broken it, or maybe it started smoking and they panicked. \n\nMy boys and \"quite a few crimes\" do not go together at all thank you very much. They have never been in any legal trouble at all. In fact, one once lost his train ticket and walked the 45 minutes home because he was scared of being caught by the ticket inspector.", "That is a boat load of speculation lol. Without knowledge of a crime you cannot punish someone.", "I have 2 guesses already - a party, or literally just broke the toaster. \n\nHow could they prove they didn't have a party?", "One spilt soup and moved everything around trying to clean it up. It all went horribly wrong from there.", "Something caught fire in the toaster.  It caused a bit of smoke to get on a few things, but not enough to stain them.  They cleaned it all, replaced the toaster in a panic, and called it good enough.\n\nAt least that's my theory from my childhood plus watching my son who is recently 18 grow up as experience in these situations.  Also because the house was left cleaner than before.\n\nEither that or a party and somehow someone fucked up the toaster, which is the most likely cause.", "I can't imagine it would be that innocent or the house wouldn't be abnormally clean.  Plus, saying they broke the toaster/it stopped working wouldn't result in sheer silence.", "If they are afraid of telling you things one way or another then you need to continue to foster an environment where they can when they\u2019re ready. If there was a party and nothing happened you should be able to talk about it without punishment and instead learning experience; toaster or chair joust accident or someone putting tinfoil and blowing it up during beer pong all on table. \n\nOr just cleaning awareness and getting ultra paranoid over some aspect (I got stupidly obsessed with cleaning the house after I started renting from my parents, things they never would let me or contemplated cleaning while they lived in the house) could be a part of this too. \n\nThe mere idea of punishing them only for the suspicion of something severe happening is only going to do them a disservice in the long run. Though the rest of your family might be the reason why they are this way already. \n\nYou\u2019ve laid out the options now, if you hold them to be responsible without being a dictator they\u2019ll come to you eventually.", "It was a huge party the kids had fun then fixed it\n\nWhen I was 16 I did the same thing\n30+person party ended up breaking the oven door when someone sat on it (they burned an ass cheek and went to the hospital) I got lucky and got a new one in about 2 days parents didn\u2019t know till I was 27", "Just remind them that if a piece of bread gets stuck in the toaster, do not try to get it out with a fork or knife because you'll be electrocuted. Unplug the toaster and then work on dealing with any smoking or burning toast in the toaster. You may want to get a fire blanket as I think they are a little easier to use in a panic compared to a home fire extinguisher. It would also be good to have them practice what to do if bread catches fire in the toaster because you want that muscle memory to kick in if there is an emergency.", "Try install security cameras in and outside your house for everyone\u2019s safety please.", "I mean, it's not a question of AITA, or even whether they should be punished. But you need open lines of communication with your kids so they know they can tell you things and that they can ask for help if they are in trouble. Given that it is your house and was your toaster, I would compel them to tell me what happened, but with no threat of punishment. Just a calm and open conversation.", "THIS!  This is 100% what I'm envisioning.  In my mind movie, the twins were making a robot toaster and bad things happened after that.  haha", "\\[doubled over in laughter\\]", "Yeah, I agree. \n\nBut when you're 17 and something happens the FIRST time dad leaves you alone overnight... The stakes feel so high.", "My sibling tried to toast mini pizzas. It went as well as expected, and the toaster did not approve", "I am impressed they got the smell of burned plastic out!   Good for them!", "\ud83d\ude02", "That's even less exciting than what I was thinking. I bet it was a bit scary in the moment though.", "That's exactly it, though. It could be as innocuous as they simply just broke the toaster. What's the solution? Get a new one. That's not a cover up, that's actually fixing the problem.", "Hey man, never know when you are going to need the ability to think on the fly and cover your tracks.", "That is horrific. I am not going to dignify that with a full response. If that is your honest default response to teenage boys, you need help.", "Paranoid fantasies much?", "I can't imagine a scenario where something like that happened and the main piece of evidence in the house is that the toaster was replaced.", "Ah yes because that scenario involves a new toaster.  I don't know what kind of sick ahit you're into bucko..but you need to seek help.", "With what? A toaster?", "Where? A toaster was replaced but it may have been very old and just stopped working for all we know. What other evidence is there?", "I still think that equating staying silent when offered the option to do so, just isn't lying at all. \n\nOp clearly said: \"if someone was arrested or went to police station and I find out from someone else, we have a problem, but if I hear from you we are good.\" \n\nThe implication then is that if no one DID get hurt or arrested, then nothing need be said at all. \n\nAt no point did op demand to be told, and they haven't volunteered the info. \n\n None of that is commensurate to lying for me.", "No one has refused to tell because OP has not asked them to tell.", "OP just has to ask.  And teenagers do get embarrassed by silly mistakes.  If I am asked, I'd tell.", "it's not going to stand up in court of Law and it won't stand up here.\n\nIt is equally possible they made sure the house was kept nice for his return and at some point the toaster broke and they bought a new one.\n\nThere is no proof anything happened", "NTA they\u2019ve been good kids in the past and you don\u2019t have any reason to suspect anything major happened. Your family wants to punish them for something that may or may not have happened and they don\u2019t even know what that potential something might be!? That\u2019s so unreasonable and will just make your kids afraid to be honest with you, if you\u2019ll punish them for nothing what will you do is there\u2019s something?", "The police can't, sure.", "Funny and innocent", "U cannot make cheesy toast !", "Or they could have done what my mother did as a child and try to defrost some frozen burgers in the toaster.", "But then the house would smell of burning, and why would they clean the rest of the house if it was just in the kitchen?", "I didn't tell a goddamned soul when I burned shit in the toaster and the whole house smelled bad so I scrubbed the whole damn place (small 2bd 1ba apt.)\n\nHonestly surprised I didn't catch the cupboards on fire.\n\nGood times.", "Toaster bong, the need of a one-off disposable bong will bring out the engineer in everyone.", "See update comment - they fessed up. They tried to clean up a spillage and moved the toaster too close to the hob and accidentally melted it. Then panic set in, cleaned, then didn't say anything because they though I'd not let them cook again if I knew they'd almost torched the place.", "Installing cameras outside, perfectly fine. Installing cameras inside the home however is a breach of privacy in my opinion. What if people are walking naked to and from the bathroom etc? If the cameras rely on a wifi connection, they can be easily hacked by a third party.", "The didn't tell me at first because they though ***I*** would be scared they'd almost torched the place. Freaked themselves out, but fundamentally no harm done and a lesson in a clear space round the hob and keeping an eye on it.", "Complains about speculation then throws out a shit ton of speculation. That guy is a little over zealous.", "Or projection?   Or maybe I've been on reddit for too long?", "It seems rude to explain things to someone who is putting so much effort into being ignorant.", "Parents are not held to the standard of a court of law and they absolutely shouldn't be.\n\nOP absolutely knows that his kids did something wrong and he thinks that covering it up means they shouldn't be punished. That might make him a good policeman, but it makes him a horrific parent.", "Neither should a parent. You lose trust and respect when you punish unjustly. Without knowing what you are punishing, you can't be just about it.", "Like some TV show. One little thing happened and it all just sort of escalated from there.", "Oh go on. Be rude. Explain it.", "There in lies the problem, he does not know they did anything, he has a suspicion. That suspicion is around a new toaster and a clean house he has no proof anything happened good or bad.", "Saying \"I know something happened, here's what I think happened, unless you give me an alternative, plausible narrative, you're going to be punished for it\" is good parenting.\n\nYou don't let kids off for being good at lying to you. That's bad parenting.", "Also futile, but that's part of the rudeness.", "You said \"there in,\" but you explicitly contradicted what I said. OP knows, beyond any reasonable doubt, that his sons did something wrong.", "There is an extremely plausible explanation though. I broke the toaster so replaced it. Honestly how do you expect OP to punish off of literally no information?", "See, that just makes me thing you have re-read the post and cannot find anything. Probably because there is not anything there. OP does not list evidence of damage. The toaster was replaced but we cannot say for certain the old one was actually damaged, it may have just broken.", "That's a really weird party if all they broke was a toaster, and there was no other evidence of a party.\n\nIt couldn't have been that crazy of a party."]}
