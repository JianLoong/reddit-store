The therapist had a day for me to open up where mom was supposed to just listen and that's what I'm posting about.\n\nFirst I'll explain some of our history.\n\nMy parents marriage was complicated when he died. One day while dad was coming to pick me up from school, he didn't get there, and after a couple of hours my mom came, and she was telling me he was probably stuck in traffic because there had been an accident near where he worked. We got home to the police at our door and then I found out my dad was gone. It broke me. \n\nA month later she was dating again and two months after she started dating she met her husband. He was a widower and she moved him in after six weeks, took over as his son's mom, and then they were married within five months of moving in. She spent more time with the baby than me, and when I wanted her time, if her husband was around she would tell me to spend time with him. I told her a few days after her wedding that I didn't like that she had gotten married so fast and I needed her. She told me life moves on and she had another child now and I needed to share with my \"brother\" and understand that we were back to being a two parent home only now we had two kids in our home. Life then pretty much carried on like my dad hadn't died so suddenly and unexpectedly, that my world hadn't been shattered. And on top of that my relationship with my mom changed monumentally and I was expected to be okay acting as though her husband was my dad and his kid was my brother. He would attempt to bond with me but it wasn't him I needed. He knew that too but I think he figured as long as his son was taken care of, he was fine with that.\n\nMy mom decided we needed therapy after she found a bunch of journals and notebooks locked away in my room. She asked if she could read them and I said no. Then she realized for the first time that I don't spend any time at home, that for years I had not given her anything for Mother's Day, that I did not put up a photo in my room of her son's adoption day, etc.\n\nSo we went to therapy and then the day came where I was open. I told her how I had felt abandoned by her, how I had resentment that she moved on and focused on giving another kid a mom when I had lost my dad and needed my mom. It was when I told her I felt like she failed me as a mom that I saw a reaction in her eyes. She played along during the rest of the session but afterward she was cold, distant, and then a couple of days after that session she told me if she was such a bad mom then why was her son so close to her and why did nobody ever tell her. I told her she had been a great mom to him, but I was talking about me. She told me I had taken my grief out on her and it wasn't fair and she would bring it up in our next session. The therapist didn't agree with her on that but she still feels that way. She's still furious with me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667895375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypfcf4/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_think_she_failed_me_as/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Despite it being in therapy I know what I said is harsh and I knew before I said it that it would get a reaction from her. That wasn't the point for me, it was me being honest. But sometimes we have to sugar coat stuff and I did not do that here. I went totally all in and called my mom a failure and I know she had lost my dad too, and I know she might have coped however she could, so I think I could be an asshole for being so harsh to the point of being unfair.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Continue therapy with your mom but I would also recommend one-on-one sessions for you because you may never get the response you need from your mom.", "NTA. You did in therapy what therapy is for, she is in denial by playing \"my son is OK with me as a parent card\", clearly beating around the bush about you feeling neglected regardless. Sounds to me she thought therapy is going to change you without having to do anything on her part and now she is not pleased with getting an answer she doesn't like.\n\nYou went through the process, you grieved, you respected the therapy. As somebody who has been through a lot of grief, I can pretty much guarantee that she did not. Even if she denies it, she had no time to grieve and with another marriage and child to take care of she repressed all that, seeing that she kind of got \"surprised\" by the fact that you weren't spending much time home, etc. only cements that.", "NTA... You simply told how you felt, and she chose to ignore it and continuously ignores it... The fact she didn't even notice all that stuff for years is beyond me... As a mother, she did fail you. She lost her husband which she seemingly replaced but you lost a father, a father cannot be replaced by any other man. I am sorry you went through this and hope you find peace.", "NTA\nYou are entitled to your own feelings and your mom to hers. Her way of processing grief is different thats why she cannot understand your perspective. I hope you both continue with therapy though.  Hopefully itll help you process your grief and repair your relationship with your mom or maybe just get it to a better place :)", "NTA You telling her how you felt about how she raised you is perfectly legitimate, and she went into therapy expecting to hear something that could be painful. Then she brought up the argument that the other kid appears to be happy, but it's obvious that a parent can be good to one child and bad to another.\n\nWhen people are in denial, they often will say things like, \"Why didn't you tell me before?\" But that's a deflection tactic. First, maybe it's because they didn't ask, or pay enough attention to see what was happening. Second, they're trying to punish you now for telling them important information, which guarantees you're not going to want to tell them important information in the future. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to reason with people who have turned off their brains. In the medium run perhaps you can get through to her, but in the short run you should expect that she's going to double down.", "Whoa huge NTA. Your mom emotionally abandoned you when you were a small child. And you had just lost your dad to boot. This just makes me sad. She replaced you with another kid and moved on and has no remorse for it. If she isn\u2019t going to take responsibility for her abandonment of you, then I think you are basically going to have to cut ties with her as the relationship will be too painful for you to maintain. Do you have other family to support you e.g. paternal grandparents? I hope you get the help and support you need as your mother is a piece of work.", "NTA. Nope, nope, nope. I'm giving your mom the benefit of the doubt that maybe she couldn't face being a single mom, and maybe had regrets over the state of her marriage to your dad that couldn't be resolved when he died, causing her to have this extreme need to remarry so quickly and put the \"happy family\" facade back up. But even with all of that, she did fail you. She failed to take your needs into account and ensure that they were met. That is the standard that any decent parent has to meet, and she failed to do so. I can't tell you where to go from here, but you are NTA. Sending you internet hugs.", "NTA. I'm so proud of you for being honest. It might take your mom some time to adjust to this information. She might never adjust to it. But that doesn't change anything for you. You were honest. That's what matters in therapy. The whole point of therapy is about getting you to be honest with yourself. And the point of group therapy is about getting two people to be honest with each other. And you did that! Whether or not she accepts what you have to say, you did the right thing. And it does sound like she failed you. It sounds like you were honest and you were correct.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Your mother failed you. It seems to me that reason your mother moved on so fast is that she used her new husband and son as a way to distract from her grief. I also think the reason she's so mad is that at some level she's come to realize that you're right. She's using excuses to shield herself from the reality of her actions.", "NTA- i think people forget that parents aren\u2019t ur parents just through blood but by the way they treat you and look after you. your mum didn\u2019t do that. she wasn\u2019t loving to you anymore and never took the time out of her day to spend time with you. she obviously realised she was in the wrong as it was her idea to go to therapy. she is now trying to manipulate the situation by mentioning how she is a good parent to your step brother but doesn\u2019t mention how she is a good mother to you which immediately shows that she knows deep down there are no examples of her being s good mother. people grieve in different ways, your mum may have found it worked for her to get married not long after your fathers death but she shouldn\u2019t have pushed that onto you and make you feel bad because your life hasn\u2019t moved on from a loss which greatly affected your life. i\u2019m so sorry your going through this", "NTA. Your world was shattered. You weren\u2019t allowed to properly express, nor receive help with, your grief. Your mother was shown a mirror and she refuses to look at the reflection. I can\u2019t imagine the spiral you were thrown in. IMO, what your mother did after your dads accident was harmful, selfish, and disrespectful. I don\u2019t know you, but as a mother, if I could hug you right now I would.", "Definitely NTA. Your mom gave you almost no time to grieve the loss of your father!", "NTA, it is OK to move on after your partner death, but when you're parent you have to keep in mind that you're not on your own anymore and any decision you make will affect your child. I think the therapy you're in came too late. It should come for both of you after your dad's unfortunate death.", "NTA.  There are a lot of moderate, well reasoned responses here, which is lucky, because my response is:. Your mother is immature, self centered, callous, and has done that thing of trying to create a blended family by force, which _never_ works and often results in estrangement.\n\nIt sounds like all she wants to hear from you is that she's a great mother, and she just isn't all that interested in anything else.\n\nI suppose if I had to be charitable, I'd say that throwing herself into her new family was part of her way if coping with grief.  But even if it's true that's just a reason, not an excuse.", "NTA - your mom didn't take the time to let you work through your father's passing and heal, instead she jumped right into the next relationship at a record pace.\n\nIt's no wonder you feel the way you do and you are absolutely justified to feel that way. I hope your therapist can make her see that.\n\nIt's not to late for both of you to mend your relationship, but for that to happen your mother needs to acknowledge she made mistakes.", "NTA. Your mom sounds so cold.", "NTA. Wow! Your mom sure is though.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Losing a parent is an incredibly difficult thing to live through. Your mom channeled all her grief into moving on asap while you needed her to comfort you and fill the hole caused by losing your dad. I can't help but feel that your mom went and got her comfort elsewhere while leaving you to fend for yourself.\n\nI think she's mad at you because deep inside she is mad at herself for letting you down and not realising it until you said it. Give her time to come around. Continue with the joint therapy sessions, but also ask your mom and stepdad about getting additional individual sessions for you and also for her, as I feel both of you need them.\n\nAll the best", "NTA. Your mom is hurt that you didn't move on in the same way she did. Your mom is not the jerk either for doing what she did, she went as fast as she could to replace what she had lost, and found meaning doing so. You telling her that she didn't meet your needs while grieving isn't a jerk thing to do, but it hurt her that she took care of herself instead of taking care of you.\n\nI'm really sorry about your dad.", "NTA and honestly *fuck her*", "NTA you're very mature and introspective for your age. Don't know if the therapy did/helped you with that or you did it on your own but you need to keep going with it.\n\nSome parents have this ridiculous attitude like 'Sure I have a kid in jail but my other one is OK so I must be a great parent.' No, no you're not. She is failing you and you're right to say so.", "NTA. Your mom is trying to shift the blame so when you turn 18 and can get out and will probably go LC/NC with her can say the problem is you. She living a fantasy and the simple fact that it took all this time to realize you don't have a relationship it only proves her neglect. I hope you are able to get out a create a real support system that help you thrive.", "Sucks for her? NTA. She tried to weaponize your shared therapy session? Hopefully she stays in therapy long enough to fix her crap?", "NTA - Your mother has behaved appallingly towards you, from practically the moment your father died, she didn't stop to think about you for one moment. Frankly, she should be thanking her lucky stars you haven't acted out on her, many would have. Still, I suspect what's happening here is your mother has been given a pretty shocking reality check and she's not coping well with it. From her perspective, everything in her life was perfect, she simply didn't notice she was losing you. I suspect she's both struggling to accept that, and, most importantly, she's struggling to accept the fact that she's the one who caused this by her actions.  \n\nBringing up how close she is to her son is denial on her part. Being told by one of your children that you've failed them must, I would imagine, be just about the worst thing a parent can hear. And it's the same for being angry at you, she's deflecting.  I also suspect your mother is very pragmatic and simply gets on with things - I understand that attitude as I tend to be that way myself, but I also know that not everyone around me has the same attitude, from the way your mother treated you as a child I suspect she believes everyone should react to things the way she does.\n\nIf I can give a slight positive, your mother clearly understands there is a problem in your relationship, she's just not ready to accept that she's the problem, or at least, she's the one who caused the problem in the first place. This might take time to work through, but, your therapist should be able to help - I see people saying you should have private therapy sessions and while that would be a good idea, perhaps it would also be good for your mother to have a few solo sessions with the therapist too, I suspect you might see some more progress if the therapist can work with your mother specifically for a time.", "NTA - Ask her why she wanted to go to therapy. Did she want to mend your relationship or did she just want to \"fix\" you? Does she see this as *you* are in therapy because *you* are the only one with the problem? Because for the record, I have a fucking problem and so will any sane person with an ounce of compassion. She's treating your father's death like it was a toy that broke. She replaced it with a new similar toy and you're an ungrateful brat for not appreciating it. I am so angry for you, I could spit. \n\nYou're a grieving kid who lost her dad. She needed to provide you with the love and support that you would get from both parents until you felt comfortable enough to start bonding with a stepfather. Then she could start to pull back a bit from being mom and dad emotionally. However she pulled a tiktok \"can we skip to the good part\" and jumped right into a new relationship like it wasn't going to affect you. It actually sounds like she felt so comfortable in the denial stage of grief that she never bothered to go through the rest of the stages. \"If I pretend I'm not grieving I'll never have to process this and I can just live happily ever after. The end.\"\n\nYour mom is emotionally immature and only a good mom to her son because he doesn't require her to be better than she is. She failed you so spectacularly because she did not step up for you like a mom should to help you process your grief. And only noticed because you didn't give her presents or let her read your journals? Seriously?! \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and I hope there are people in your life who can support you aside from the good weirdos of reddit.", "NTA - there could be lots of reasons why your mother is denying this so deeply (her marriage was a prop that she rushed into and she isn\u2019t as happy as she makes out but is scared to admit that; she wasn\u2019t as happy with your dad as she\u2019d like you to believe and thinks you idealise him; she already felt like she was failing you when your dad died - the list goes on). But none of those are your fault, your feelings are reasonable given the situation, and your behaviour more than reasonable, and you were giving your therapist the best and most honest shot at helping you all by being open about this.\n\nIt might take a while for your mother to learn to sit with your feelings and understand things from your perspective, and she may reject them forever. But having the strength to face your own feelings is huge for you and she may just be jealous that you were able to do that and to process your grief where she has not been able to.\n\nEither way, she is now trying to push you into saying that you didn\u2019t really mean it so she can carry on avoiding accountability for her behaviour and for disregarding your feelings (and perhaps her own). Don\u2019t let her call that shot.\n\nOf course you\u2019re taking your grief out on her - half of it is for the mother and the life you feel you lost as well as the father you did lose; and since she didn\u2019t actually die, she probably doesn\u2019t feel strong enough to admit that she made some mistakes and that in moving her own life on, she left yours behind.\n\nGuilt will do strange things. Keep telling your truth and being as honest as you can - and let her digest that information and refuse to let her push the guilty feelings she has back towards you. Eventually she will probably realise that you have a point (especially if your brother is less easy to parent as he gets older) but up until then you can\u2019t even consider whether or not you\u2019re willing to forgive her because there needs to be change from her before your forgiveness even becomes relevant. She clearly wants it (to ease her own guilty conscience - that\u2019s why she\u2019s deflecting by comparing you with your brother) but she needs to earn it.", "NTA \n\nYour mom was so busy running toward her new life, she forgot you were supposed to be part of it. \n\nLove to you, you have been through a horrendous experience and come across as a very well balanced individual.  Keep up the therapy for you and no one else.", "NTA. It will take mom a bit of time to accept what you have said. Give mom time to adjust to what you told her. . She was in never never land  burying her feelings for the passing of your dad and dating allowed her to avoid feeling lonely. More than likely she honestly does not remember the aftermath of your dad's death the same as you so give her time to reflect. Hang in there. I know that regardless of your mom's reasons for her actions back then, you still have unresolved hurt and rightfully so.", "It's something the therapist has suggested I get but I don't think my mom would be too willing to let that happen right now.", "Nta  keep the therapy. See if your step-dad will pay of mom doesn't.", "Yeah wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if they were \u201cdating\u201d before OPs dad passed away with how quickly he moved in and they got married\n\nAlso I\u2019d just go straight up NC OP when you get the chance, potentially when you go to college or after school when you can get a job and move out. As it appears your mother has pushed you aside and replaced her family and will likely never treat you with respect or love again.", "Totally agree with your response.", "There was a lot of stuff she missed. But I guess once I wasn't acting up or making a big deal of it she just didn't see me.", "I think our relationship might be beyond repair now.", "This. Also NTA.", "I often suspected she was done with the marriage more than my dad was. Maybe there was some guilt about that. Maybe there was some relief when he was gone and she didn't have to pretend anymore, if I'm right about her feelings. All I know is she never stopped and took the time to make sure I was okay after everything. That's how I've felt for so long but I hate questioning if I shouldn't have said it. Thanks for the internet hugs.", "Don't let anyone tell you otherwise so NTA. Continue with your therapy as much as you need. You are not a bad person seeking therapy", "Mention to your mum something that makes it sound like the therapist is trying to get you to see it from her side.", "The OP said two months after her dad died, mom MET her husband. She started dating one month after, but not dating the guy she married", "Whatever she did wasn't fair to you. And, you don't have to make a big deal out of something everytime just to be noticed, that is just neglect on her part. \\*Virtual Hug\\*", "Yeah I know that\u2019s what OP got told but I\u2019m saying with how fast things progressed it kinda seems that there may have been something on beforehand, even if they did meet after OPs mom seemed to be already checked out of her previous relationship quickly.", "I think mom was just avoiding grieving by moving on that quickly and OP never said it's what she got told, so I would assume it's what she witnessed.", "Well if she did that along tells you that OPs mom has never really been in a stable state on mind tbh. And by not allowing herself to grieve and move past this, she instead has buried all emotions and feelings for her late husband away which has unfortunately affected the way she sees OP and clearly she would be a constant reminder of him. This would explain why OPs mom avoided her so to say and more or less fixated on the new child instead. \n\nCould also say the same if her mom was having a affair with the stepdad and waited the two months after to make it official just so it seemed less sus. Same thing would apply to OP being a reminder."]}
