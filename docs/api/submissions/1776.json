The therapist had a day for me to open up where mom was supposed to just listen and that's what I'm posting about.\n\nFirst I'll explain some of our history.\n\nMy parents marriage was complicated when he died. One day while dad was coming to pick me up from school, he didn't get there, and after a couple of hours my mom came, and she was telling me he was probably stuck in traffic because there had been an accident near where he worked. We got home to the police at our door and then I found out my dad was gone. It broke me. \n\nA month later she was dating again and two months after she started dating she met her husband. He was a widower and she moved him in after six weeks, took over as his son's mom, and then they were married within five months of moving in. She spent more time with the baby than me, and when I wanted her time, if her husband was around she would tell me to spend time with him. I told her a few days after her wedding that I didn't like that she had gotten married so fast and I needed her. She told me life moves on and she had another child now and I needed to share with my \"brother\" and understand that we were back to being a two parent home only now we had two kids in our home. Life then pretty much carried on like my dad hadn't died so suddenly and unexpectedly, that my world hadn't been shattered. And on top of that my relationship with my mom changed monumentally and I was expected to be okay acting as though her husband was my dad and his kid was my brother. He would attempt to bond with me but it wasn't him I needed. He knew that too but I think he figured as long as his son was taken care of, he was fine with that.\n\nMy mom decided we needed therapy after she found a bunch of journals and notebooks locked away in my room. She asked if she could read them and I said no. Then she realized for the first time that I don't spend any time at home, that for years I had not given her anything for Mother's Day, that I did not put up a photo in my room of her son's adoption day, etc.\n\nSo we went to therapy and then the day came where I was open. I told her how I had felt abandoned by her, how I had resentment that she moved on and focused on giving another kid a mom when I had lost my dad and needed my mom. It was when I told her I felt like she failed me as a mom that I saw a reaction in her eyes. She played along during the rest of the session but afterward she was cold, distant, and then a couple of days after that session she told me if she was such a bad mom then why was her son so close to her and why did nobody ever tell her. I told her she had been a great mom to him, but I was talking about me. She told me I had taken my grief out on her and it wasn't fair and she would bring it up in our next session. The therapist didn't agree with her on that but she still feels that way. She's still furious with me.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667895375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypfcf4/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_think_she_failed_me_as/", "score": 1121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Despite it being in therapy I know what I said is harsh and I knew before I said it that it would get a reaction from her. That wasn't the point for me, it was me being honest. But sometimes we have to sugar coat stuff and I did not do that here. I went totally all in and called my mom a failure and I know she had lost my dad too, and I know she might have coped however she could, so I think I could be an asshole for being so harsh to the point of being unfair.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Continue therapy with your mom but I would also recommend one-on-one sessions for you because you may never get the response you need from your mom.", "NTA. You did in therapy what therapy is for, she is in denial by playing \"my son is OK with me as a parent card\", clearly beating around the bush about you feeling neglected regardless. Sounds to me she thought therapy is going to change you without having to do anything on her part and now she is not pleased with getting an answer she doesn't like.\n\nYou went through the process, you grieved, you respected the therapy. As somebody who has been through a lot of grief, I can pretty much guarantee that she did not. Even if she denies it, she had no time to grieve and with another marriage and child to take care of she repressed all that, seeing that she kind of got \"surprised\" by the fact that you weren't spending much time home, etc. only cements that.", "NTA... You simply told how you felt, and she chose to ignore it and continuously ignores it... The fact she didn't even notice all that stuff for years is beyond me... As a mother, she did fail you. She lost her husband which she seemingly replaced but you lost a father, a father cannot be replaced by any other man. I am sorry you went through this and hope you find peace.", "NTA\nYou are entitled to your own feelings and your mom to hers. Her way of processing grief is different thats why she cannot understand your perspective. I hope you both continue with therapy though.  Hopefully itll help you process your grief and repair your relationship with your mom or maybe just get it to a better place :)", "NTA You telling her how you felt about how she raised you is perfectly legitimate, and she went into therapy expecting to hear something that could be painful. Then she brought up the argument that the other kid appears to be happy, but it's obvious that a parent can be good to one child and bad to another.\n\nWhen people are in denial, they often will say things like, \"Why didn't you tell me before?\" But that's a deflection tactic. First, maybe it's because they didn't ask, or pay enough attention to see what was happening. Second, they're trying to punish you now for telling them important information, which guarantees you're not going to want to tell them important information in the future. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to reason with people who have turned off their brains. In the medium run perhaps you can get through to her, but in the short run you should expect that she's going to double down.", "Whoa huge NTA. Your mom emotionally abandoned you when you were a small child. And you had just lost your dad to boot. This just makes me sad. She replaced you with another kid and moved on and has no remorse for it. If she isn\u2019t going to take responsibility for her abandonment of you, then I think you are basically going to have to cut ties with her as the relationship will be too painful for you to maintain. Do you have other family to support you e.g. paternal grandparents? I hope you get the help and support you need as your mother is a piece of work.", "NTA. Nope, nope, nope. I'm giving your mom the benefit of the doubt that maybe she couldn't face being a single mom, and maybe had regrets over the state of her marriage to your dad that couldn't be resolved when he died, causing her to have this extreme need to remarry so quickly and put the \"happy family\" facade back up. But even with all of that, she did fail you. She failed to take your needs into account and ensure that they were met. That is the standard that any decent parent has to meet, and she failed to do so. I can't tell you where to go from here, but you are NTA. Sending you internet hugs.", "NTA. I'm so proud of you for being honest. It might take your mom some time to adjust to this information. She might never adjust to it. But that doesn't change anything for you. You were honest. That's what matters in therapy. The whole point of therapy is about getting you to be honest with yourself. And the point of group therapy is about getting two people to be honest with each other. And you did that! Whether or not she accepts what you have to say, you did the right thing. And it does sound like she failed you. It sounds like you were honest and you were correct.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Your mother failed you. It seems to me that reason your mother moved on so fast is that she used her new husband and son as a way to distract from her grief. I also think the reason she's so mad is that at some level she's come to realize that you're right. She's using excuses to shield herself from the reality of her actions.", "NTA- i think people forget that parents aren\u2019t ur parents just through blood but by the way they treat you and look after you. your mum didn\u2019t do that. she wasn\u2019t loving to you anymore and never took the time out of her day to spend time with you. she obviously realised she was in the wrong as it was her idea to go to therapy. she is now trying to manipulate the situation by mentioning how she is a good parent to your step brother but doesn\u2019t mention how she is a good mother to you which immediately shows that she knows deep down there are no examples of her being s good mother. people grieve in different ways, your mum may have found it worked for her to get married not long after your fathers death but she shouldn\u2019t have pushed that onto you and make you feel bad because your life hasn\u2019t moved on from a loss which greatly affected your life. i\u2019m so sorry your going through this", "NTA. Your world was shattered. You weren\u2019t allowed to properly express, nor receive help with, your grief. Your mother was shown a mirror and she refuses to look at the reflection. I can\u2019t imagine the spiral you were thrown in. IMO, what your mother did after your dads accident was harmful, selfish, and disrespectful. I don\u2019t know you, but as a mother, if I could hug you right now I would.", "Definitely NTA. Your mom gave you almost no time to grieve the loss of your father!", "NTA, it is OK to move on after your partner death, but when you're parent you have to keep in mind that you're not on your own anymore and any decision you make will affect your child. I think the therapy you're in came too late. It should come for both of you after your dad's unfortunate death.", "NTA.  There are a lot of moderate, well reasoned responses here, which is lucky, because my response is:. Your mother is immature, self centered, callous, and has done that thing of trying to create a blended family by force, which _never_ works and often results in estrangement.\n\nIt sounds like all she wants to hear from you is that she's a great mother, and she just isn't all that interested in anything else.\n\nI suppose if I had to be charitable, I'd say that throwing herself into her new family was part of her way if coping with grief.  But even if it's true that's just a reason, not an excuse.", "NTA - your mom didn't take the time to let you work through your father's passing and heal, instead she jumped right into the next relationship at a record pace.\n\nIt's no wonder you feel the way you do and you are absolutely justified to feel that way. I hope your therapist can make her see that.\n\nIt's not to late for both of you to mend your relationship, but for that to happen your mother needs to acknowledge she made mistakes.", "NTA.

Losing a parent is an incredibly difficult thing to live through. Your mom channeled all her grief into moving on asap while you needed her to comfort you and fill the hole caused by losing your dad. I can't help but feel that your mom went and got her comfort elsewhere while leaving you to fend for yourself.\n\nI think she's mad at you because deep inside she is mad at herself for letting you down and not realising it until you said it. Give her time to come around. Continue with the joint therapy sessions, but also ask your mom and stepdad about getting additional individual sessions for you and also for her, as I feel both of you need them.\n\nAll the best", "NTA. Your mom is hurt that you didn't move on in the same way she did. Your mom is not the jerk either for doing what she did, she went as fast as she could to replace what she had lost, and found meaning doing so. You telling her that she didn't meet your needs while grieving isn't a jerk thing to do, but it hurt her that she took care of herself instead of taking care of you.\n\nI'm really sorry about your dad.", "NTA and honestly *fuck her*", "NTA you're very mature and introspective for your age. Don't know if the therapy did/helped you with that or you did it on your own but you need to keep going with it.\n\nSome parents have this ridiculous attitude like 'Sure I have a kid in jail but my other one is OK so I must be a great parent.' No, no you're not. She is failing you and you're right to say so.", "NTA. Your mom is trying to shift the blame so when you turn 18 and can get out and will probably go LC/NC with her can say the problem is you. She living a fantasy and the simple fact that it took all this time to realize you don't have a relationship it only proves her neglect. I hope you are able to get out a create a real support system that help you thrive.", "Sucks for her? NTA. She tried to weaponize your shared therapy session? Hopefully she stays in therapy long enough to fix her crap?", "NTA - Your mother has behaved appallingly towards you, from practically the moment your father died, she didn't stop to think about you for one moment. Frankly, she should be thanking her lucky stars you haven't acted out on her, many would have. Still, I suspect what's happening here is your mother has been given a pretty shocking reality check and she's not coping well with it. From her perspective, everything in her life was perfect, she simply didn't notice she was losing you. I suspect she's both struggling to accept that, and, most importantly, she's struggling to accept the fact that she's the one who caused this by her actions.  \n\nBringing up how close she is to her son is denial on her part. Being told by one of your children that you've failed them must, I would imagine, be just about the worst thing a parent can hear. And it's the same for being angry at you, she's deflecting.  I also suspect your mother is very pragmatic and simply gets on with things - I understand that attitude as I tend to be that way myself, but I also know that not everyone around me has the same attitude, from the way your mother treated you as a child I suspect she believes everyone should react to things the way she does.\n\nIf I can give a slight positive, your mother clearly understands there is a problem in your relationship, she's just not ready to accept that she's the problem, or at least, she's the one who caused the problem in the first place. This might take time to work through, but, your therapist should be able to help - I see people saying you should have private therapy sessions and while that would be a good idea, perhaps it would also be good for your mother to have a few solo sessions with the therapist too, I suspect you might see some more progress if the therapist can work with your mother specifically for a time.", "NTA - Ask her why she wanted to go to therapy. Did she want to mend your relationship or did she just want to \"fix\" you? Does she see this as *you* are in therapy because *you* are the only one with the problem? Because for the record, I have a fucking problem and so will any sane person with an ounce of compassion. She's treating your father's death like it was a toy that broke. She replaced it with a new similar toy and you're an ungrateful brat for not appreciating it. I am so angry for you, I could spit. \n\nYou're a grieving kid who lost her dad. She needed to provide you with the love and support that you would get from both parents until you felt comfortable enough to start bonding with a stepfather. Then she could start to pull back a bit from being mom and dad emotionally. However she pulled a tiktok \"can we skip to the good part\" and jumped right into a new relationship like it wasn't going to affect you. It actually sounds like she felt so comfortable in the denial stage of grief that she never bothered to go through the rest of the stages. \"If I pretend I'm not grieving I'll never have to process this and I can just live happily ever after. The end.\"\n\nYour mom is emotionally immature and only a good mom to her son because he doesn't require her to be better than she is. She failed you so spectacularly because she did not step up for you like a mom should to help you process your grief. And only noticed because you didn't give her presents or let her read your journals? Seriously?! \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss and I hope there are people in your life who can support you aside from the good weirdos of reddit.", "NTA - there could be lots of reasons why your mother is denying this so deeply (her marriage was a prop that she rushed into and she isn\u2019t as happy as she makes out but is scared to admit that; she wasn\u2019t as happy with your dad as she\u2019d like you to believe and thinks you idealise him; she already felt like she was failing you when your dad died - the list goes on). But none of those are your fault, your feelings are reasonable given the situation, and your behaviour more than reasonable, and you were giving your therapist the best and most honest shot at helping you all by being open about this.\n\nIt might take a while for your mother to learn to sit with your feelings and understand things from your perspective, and she may reject them forever. But having the strength to face your own feelings is huge for you and she may just be jealous that you were able to do that and to process your grief where she has not been able to.\n\nEither way, she is now trying to push you into saying that you didn\u2019t really mean it so she can carry on avoiding accountability for her behaviour and for disregarding your feelings (and perhaps her own). Don\u2019t let her call that shot.\n\nOf course you\u2019re taking your grief out on her - half of it is for the mother and the life you feel you lost as well as the father you did lose; and since she didn\u2019t actually die, she probably doesn\u2019t feel strong enough to admit that she made some mistakes and that in moving her own life on, she left yours behind.\n\nGuilt will do strange things. Keep telling your truth and being as honest as you can - and let her digest that information and refuse to let her push the guilty feelings she has back towards you. Eventually she will probably realise that you have a point (especially if your brother is less easy to parent as he gets older) but up until then you can\u2019t even consider whether or not you\u2019re willing to forgive her because there needs to be change from her before your forgiveness even becomes relevant. She clearly wants it (to ease her own guilty conscience - that\u2019s why she\u2019s deflecting by comparing you with your brother) but she needs to earn it.", "NTA \n\nYour mom was so busy running toward her new life, she forgot you were supposed to be part of it. \n\nLove to you, you have been through a horrendous experience and come across as a very well balanced individual.  Keep up the therapy for you and no one else.", "NTA. It will take mom a bit of time to accept what you have said. Give mom time to adjust to what you told her. . She was in never never land  burying her feelings for the passing of your dad and dating allowed her to avoid feeling lonely. More than likely she honestly does not remember the aftermath of your dad's death the same as you so give her time to reflect. Hang in there.

And by not allowing herself to grieve and move past this, she instead has buried all emotions and feelings for her late husband away which has unfortunately affected the way she sees OP and clearly she would be a constant reminder of him.

I understand that as a mother / wife, it must have been hard on her as well but it seems like she disregarded your feelings and wellbeing altogether.

Just because she was able to move on quickly and take on another child doesn't mean you was. \n\nShe put you on the back burner, and didn't realise for YEARS that your relationship with her was non existent because she was so focused on being a mother to her husbands son, that's why they are so close. Instead of helping you through your grief, the change in your family with new people entering it, she sent you to her husband and ignored you when you was honest with her. \n\nPeople can say she's a good mother to her son, but can they say that about her relationship with you?

She takes it as an insult instead of looking to see if you have a point. She might be angry but she the reason you both are in therapy is to look for what happened, discuss it and heal.

That being said, her reaction reminds me a lot of single mothers I\u2019ve met in my community who resent their \u2018first lives\u2019. They meet a man who, like you\u2019ve experienced, were better men to their daughters than their wives. I don\u2019t mean jealousy. I mean men who neglect, cheat, beat, fight, etc their wives after they birth them a child. Maybe they do just enough that no one thinks they\u2019re credible for wanting to leave. Or they\u2019re taught a wife is meant to be this way and they stay married in resentment. She may also be angry at herself and she\u2019s an avoidant person trying to justify herself. Maybe this man had the means to provide for the whole family and she couldn\u2019t herself. There\u2019s a lot of speculation on moms side that could help your therapy process but ultimately you\u2019re not the AH here", "Granted I am not sure where you reside, but I am pretty sure a 17-year-old can get mental help without a parent. If anything, it's illegal for any therapist to share with your parent the things you discuss in your meetings. IF you are in school, see your guidance counselor to maybe refer you on your own counselor. It could be a diff therapist, but at least you would alone and have a chance to move forward independently.", "If you have to sign up with the therapist online so she doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re going.

Good luck.", "You absolutely should have said it. \n\nNTA\n\nShe is using guilt to make you try and back down and rewrite the narrative. But I think in her heart she knows that she\u2019s wrong which is why she is conflicted, because she\u2019s the one that noticed your relationship has ended and there\u2019s something wrong and initiated therapy. Those are very big things.\n\nThen she punishes you for what you said in therapy, which feels kind of narcissistic. \n\nIf there\u2019s a next session then let her say whatever she wants, the therapist obviously knows did not letting a child grieve, adopting a new child immediately into the home of the mourning child, and then claiming that this child she favored sees her as a good mother \u201cwhy don\u2019t you?\u201d \n\nShe is wrong and she must know the reason for your disconnection and absence in the family is that you feel no love or attention or caring and you are beyond trying. \n\nShe basically tried to delegate the role of parenting to your instant replacement father and he sounds like he was a decent man to some extent, but she didn\u2019t let you mourn, she didn\u2019t mourn a relationship you didn\u2019t realize she was done with, and then she abandoned you and replaced you with a new baby. \n\nAnd why in god\u2019s name would you put a picture up in your room of your brother\u2019s adoption day? To you that\u2019s just represents the formalizing of your abandonment. \n\n\u201cMom you\u2019re the one who noticed that I never spend time at home, that I don\u2019t give you Mother\u2019s Day cards, and I spoke my truth - my reality. You were concerned enough to get us into therapy but you don\u2019t want to hear what I have to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your answer in response is that your son - the only child you care about, the one you replaced me with right after we put my father\u2018s body in the ground - says you\u2019re a good mother? You are a good mother to him but you are not my mother anymore and I doubt we\u2019re going to have a relationship in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you don\u2019t think that\u2019s painful for me both to experience 10 years of the sadness and neglect of your absence in failure to give me any attention, it has broken me as a person. So at this point, having failed to notice any of this, and wanting to read my journals instead of talking to me, and then not wanting to hear the answer: why do you even care?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have your son you have your husband and you made very clear that day that your old family died with your husband, and I was no longer necessary.\u201d\n\nEdit: \nSome links for you that others have found helpful, the apology link is to show you what someone who is truly remorseful would be doing right now. \n\nMaybe you can share that with her and tell her \u201cmom if you really don\u2019t care that\u2019s fine, but if you do care you\u2019re not getting it for free, you need to take responsibility for your actions and how they affected me and you need to apologize otherwise we are not going to have a very good relationship going forward.\u201d \n\nDoes she think she\u2019s going to be at your wedding? Or that you would allow her access to her grandchildren? Is she even thinking about these things? Also is her new husband financially secure, are they planning on sending you to college?

You have all the right to feel resentful but don't let that eat you. If you don't feel happy anymore, remember you have other sources like friends, other relatives, yourself.

Or if she'd looked straight in your face and said she thought you were a failure as a daughter? You'd be permanently changed, wouldn't you? And so would your feelings towards her? Even if you both put all the work in and got to a better place with a great relationship in the future, there would still be moments where you'd look at at her and think \"she thinks __ about me\" and your stomach would turn. Same for her, now.\n\nSaying something in therapy doesn't magically have a \"what happens in Vegas, stats in Vegas\" effect.\n\nSo yeah, she is going to remember what you said, and because she is human, she isn't going to like it and will reject it, and by association, you. Her son thinks she's an awesome mom, so it would be easy enough for her to make it your fault, not hers.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why using \"I\" statements in therapy is so, so, so important, and why they so strongly emphasize talking about the effect on you, rather than placing blame or making accusations on them. Because doing so is not helpful and makes the other party check out and give up. \n\nYou were doing awesome explaining that you felt abandoned and that you'd like more attention...but curb stomped yourself with the \"you're a failure as a mom\" thing. She has latched on to that single statement, and won't be able to see or address anything else you brought up because of it.\n\nI think you're going to have to walk this back and soften it. Say you misspoke, or had been accidentally overly dramatic. Your therapist should have caught your accusation when you made it and then tried to work it back for you into something manageable, but it seems they didn't  The therapist might help you come up with a better way to articulate how you're feeling in a way which doesn't accuse or assign blame, and which makes your mom want to buy in to a relationship with you, rather than write things off as failed from the start and not capable of worth fixing.\n\nYou need mom to get past this statement so she can see everything else.\n\nI'm leaning ESH for \"everything sucks\". You're not truly an asshole, just extremely young, and your mom is human. This is just a crappy situation all around.", "It's hard when you lose your spouse/ child a parents.  You can post and get help, but the bottom line is each person, has to deal with it their way.  Some move on quickly, some years after...  I gave my whole life to my child and never remarried, only dated a little and he only meet one of those men.  You might think this is great, but in the long run- I realize there should have been some middle ground\n\nYour mother did what she thought was best, doesn't make it right, doesn't make it wrong, just makes it hard to move on.  She can be mad at you all she wants.  It's not going to change the fact you thought she did a crappy job", "So there's a few issues here all lumped together.\n\nFirst of all, time it took her to move on.  You say:\n\n> My parents marriage was complicated when he died.\n\nSo I take that to mean that there were issues in their marriage.  Possibly heading towards a divorce.  The way things tend to work in adult relationships that are long term is that people keep trying to keep them going long past when they actually end.  The way this ends up looking is that someone \"moves on\" very quickly.  But the key here is that they started dealing with the end of the relationship many months or even years before it actually ended.  So while she moved on quite quickly after he passed, she may have started moving on from the relationship quite a while before he passed.\n\nI don't think that excuses her actions here, but it helps to explain why she \"moved on\" so quickly, because in her hart, it's not actually that quickly.\n\nSo, while I can totally understand how you didn't \"move on\" that quickly, I don't think you should hold anger towards your mom for how quickly she moved on.\n\nI DO think you should have anger towards your mom for bungling the transition into the blended family so badly. And it's in that transition that she actually failed you as a Mom.  To your credit, often people in your situation take out that anger on the new step-parent, or sibling but it seems like you've correctly placed the blame on her.", "There's two things here they need to resolve.  One is how Mom focused on the baby, and ignored the daughter.\n\nthe other is, possibly, the betrayal of her father's memory implied by how fast Mom moved on.   My point being that finding somebody new so fast isn't something the daughter gets to judge.  Her Mom moving on isn't disrespecting the daughter's grief, but expecting her to move on as quickly, is.", "She didn\u2019t move on, she had just already found a replacement.", "everyone grieves differently.  maybe this is how mom dealt with it --- found a ready made family.  unfortunately the OP pays.", "I think you missed the part where OP's mom neglected OP for a new husband and son. She may not have intentionally abandoned OP, but it sure as hell looks like she didn't intentionally spend time with her grieving child. How blind does one have to be for it to take literal years to notice that your child is in so much pain and actively avoiding you?", "So everyone will agree with you, she failed as a mother to you.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that she doesn\u2019t see it that way. Maybe as you become and adult and go LC/NC with her will recognize, but don\u2019t hold out hope. Your mom is so self-absorbed that she doesn\u2019t recognize the impacts of her actions and probably never will.\n\nContinue therapy, and find ways to heal yourself. Don\u2019t let her make you feel guilty for something she is responsible for. She is a bad mother to you. End of story.", "Your mum knows she failed you, but that doesn't fit in with the narrative she has written in her head so she'll always lash out against it.

They give the parents the chance to do the correct thing, in your case individual counseling. Then they keep an eye in things to make sure your being provided the transportation to get to your appointments. And even if your mother had been the most supportive person in the world, you could still end up needing therapy to deal with your dad\u2019s death. Even adults need it m, especially when it\u2019s before old age. I don\u2019t feel your mom was necessarily wrong for moving on because their marriage being complicated often means problems in the marriage so her moving on isn\u2019t really a bad thing.

They had multiple options, so I went to addictions for alcoholism and then trauma counselling. It was done during school hours (I\u2019d get a spare and she would come to the school for that \u201cclass\u201d to counsel me) it was fully anonymous unless I was at risk of harming myself or another person. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve done the whole bring a parent to counselling. It was so hard. My dad didn\u2019t listen to me, until the Counsellor told him to stop and process what I was actually saying before responding so rash, because it was genuinely hurting me. It took him a couple seconds, but he did end up understanding and we had a very good relationship up until a few weeks ago. \n\nIt can happen.

You aren't blaming your mom for your pain, you are simply stating that when you needed her, she wasn't there.

(((hugz))) Her feelings mattered as well, the issue here isn\u2019t that you feel your feelings should matter more, the issue is that, demonstrably, your mother didn\u2019t take your feelings into account at all. OP please note that this sub overwhelmingly agrees with you. Sometimes it\u2019s easy to focus on the few negative voices, but there\u2019s always going to be ppl like that even though the far vast majority of us aren\u2019t that foolish. Your mom neglected you for years. And only, once again when *her* feelings were bothered, did she seek \u201chelp\u201d for you. Which again, wasn\u2019t really for you per say, what she wanted was a professional to tell you that you are wrong so she can continue to delude herself that she did right by you. Unfortunately, even after reading your journals (which was a violation!), even after you baring your truth in therapy & hearing it from your mouth, and even after a professional has weighed in, your mom refuses to see any fault in her actions. It would be one thing if she f\u2019d up and then realized in pursuing her own needs she neglected you and apologized and tried to make amends. But your mom is the type to never admit fault, and even if she recognizes she could\u2019ve done better, she twists it in her mind in making herself the victim and she expects grace from everyone else. Ask me how I know. Sadly a chunk of us lose at the mother raffle in life. Please, I know this is difficult not to, but don\u2019t internalize this. This is not your fault. Maybe speak to your stepfather about individual therapy, maybe feeling pressure from her husband will have her relent and allow you to have individual therapy. Or if you have other trustworthy family members, they could speak to your mom, your mom is all about appearances of being the best mom. As a last resort you could speak to a guidance counselor or call a anonymous report to CPS that your mother is refusing to provide you individual therapy when recommended by your therapist, an authoritative figure may have to force your mother to do what is right.  I am so sorry you have been neglected. What your mom did is wrong and it\u2019s frustrating b/c she may never recognize it and I know you want that so badly. Regrettably, as a person much older than you I am warning you not to wait for that self realization to happen on your mom\u2019s part, that day may never come. But you will be ok. And me and all these other thousands of ppl have heard you and recognize that your mom was wrong and continues to be. Sometimes in life you have to form what is known as a \u201cchosen\u201d family, family isn\u2019t only based on DNA. You will find a group of ppl in the future who will prove themselves worthy of being in your life by providing love, support and care.
