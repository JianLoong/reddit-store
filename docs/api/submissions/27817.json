NTA.", "NTA, especially if you have dietary restrictions and purchase your own food anyway. If the food that you buy for yourself isn't perishable, start storing in in your room.\n\nAs far as the \"don't use my electricity\" bs, that's covered in the $200 you give your mom.", "No offense, but gluten free products are typically gross.  I say that because if there is a choice, most of the time people will pick gluten if they don't have dietary needs.  Your step dad did that as a total power move to show you who is boss.  You have a couple of choices.  You can put your special foods in your room, you can accept that this is just the first of many of his power moves, or you can move out.  I know your money is tight, but that's the option I'd look at.  NTA, OP.", "NTA but you should discuss with your mom.  The 235 must count towards food and electricity?  Also, who owns the house, mom or stepdad?", "NTA, and what an overblown reaction he had to what you asked of him. My mom is similar- she a narcissistic problem with being told 'no,' and when you do she tries very hard to wrestle control and autonomy out of your hands.", "NTA. You bought a specific product for dietary reasons, which from experience are not cheap, it is not unreasonable to ask that to not be eaten when I doubt they\u2019ll replace it. You pay rent, an agreed upon amount so he has no business telling you that you can\u2019t use food or electricity the rest of the household can use. Have you tried talking to your mom?", "Threatened by asking him to leave gluten free bread alone??? What a contemptible fool.  Tell everyone what he\u2019s doing, record his tirade and share it with everyone- what an ass\u2026", "NTA He was embarrassed and pissed off at being told no because he sees himself as being in a position of authority over you. Some people just can\u2019t handle someone they think they have control of exhibiting some control of their own.\n\nAs an intern, I brought in treats for a coworker\u2019s birthday once which were arranged in a cute box. They were a gift & I wanted her to open it, so when our manager made a beeline for the box, I just asked him to wait because they were for \u201cSuzy\u201d. As soon as Suzy got there and offered the box around, he glared at me while taking one and kept eye contact as he ate it as if to show me who was in charge. He never spoke to me again.", "Does he always blow up on you like this?\n\nHim berating you as you cry is a little emotionally abusive. \n\nMove out as soon as you can, living with him will only deteriorate your mental health. \n\nNta", "As soon as he was challenged he got abusive NTA and speak to your mother about this. If she sides with him it doesn't matter if they pay YOU to stay you need to GTFO.", "NTA - He can eat any bread and you have a limited choice in what you can eat so it's not unreasonable to ask him to refrain from eating it. I would certainly talk to your mother about how he is acting. Is he usually like this?", "NTA\n\nHave you told your mother about his behaviour? It is unacceptable to repeatedly patronise and demean someone else, especially when you can see that your behaviour is upsetting them. You have specific dietary requirements that mean you need your food exclusively. He does not. He's being an AH on purpose.\n\nIt may be that he's tired of you being in his home, but if that's the case, he needs to talk about it without being an AH. His attitude and behaviour here are disgraceful. If your mother is on his side despite him obviously being a bully, then you need to find a way to move out.", "NTA- you pay rent. You have to have special food due to dietary restrictions. It is not unreasonable to ask him to not eat your special food. He reacted like a child", "NTA your step-dad is definitely one though", "If you don't pay for your gluten-free food, it's kind of an AH move to tell someone not to eat 'your' bread. But at the same time, you have dietary restrictions, and if your other family members don't share the same restrictions and have their own bread, they're also acting like AH.\n\nWhat disturbs me most is your stepdad's reaction though. Total dickmove", "NTA he sounds petty AF! I hope you don\u2019t have to stay there too much longer.", "ESH - You don't pay hardly anything towards the house (I'm extremely lucky and blessed, your words) so him eating a couple slice's of bread should not be that big of a deal for you to go off on him like that.  Having said that, he shouldn't have responded back to you just as badly.  And he asked you help out not feed the whole damn house so stop being so dramatic.", "I have to disagree with the other comments here. You nitpicked a couple of slices of bread, when you are eating his food and getting basically free utilities with that super low rent. \n\nYou now have a couple of choices: \n1. Pay your fair share of utilities in addition to rent, and buy all your own food\n2. Apologize and see if you can go back to the previous arrangement \n3. Move out\n\n2 will be the cheapest.", "ESH. OP lives in his house, paying almost nothing, surely eating the household food. He eats a couple pieces of bread from a loaf and there's plenty more. OP then goes and scolds him for it. Huge AH move OP part.\n\nStepdad then over reacts. Though I get his frustration and the awful way OP handled it. But he didn't need to do that. So huge AH move on his side. Both did wrong here.", "I cannot comprehend all of the \u201cNTA\u201d. You LITERALLY created a mess over 2 pieces of fucking bread?  How rude- he is right - you don\u2019t pay for food or bills. They do a lot for you and you get bent over 2 pieces of bread. Keep crying I guess YTA.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nHe can stop eating your food and you can stop eating his.  Fair is fair.\n\nI would love to have seen exactly how you told him to stop eating your food. I have a feeling it was not said nicely.", "so you're getting a place to live for $200 a month (and $35 for your phone)  free utilities and apparently free food-- but had a hissy fit because your step dad (who I assume is the one supporting you ate a couple of pieces of \"your\" bread.  Yeah, YTA here.  You tried to make your stepdad feel bad for eating a couple of pieces of bread-- but shouldn't you feel bad about eating HIS food and using his electricity?", "I'll get down voted for this but I think you're the a-hole here.  He is letting you live in the house at an incredible rate and feeds you. And your reaction was for him not to eat a few slices of bread.\n\nHis reaction was a bit over the top for an adult. But I also understand it.  \n\nIf you don't like it, move out on your own.", "Both of you are assholes. He ate a few pieces of your bread?!!!

There is absolutely nothing unreasonable about that. She has dietary restrictions and doesn't have the luxury to just use whatever bread they have lying around, so it's a major asshole move on the step fathers part to make what is a limit resource for her, even more limited. She has every right to ask that her bread be left for just her.", "But gluten free bread is more expensive and she can't have regular bread because of a dietary restriction. She bought a more expensive product and can't substitute it like he can. He can eat anything in the house, she can't.", "\"Hey please don't eat my gluten free bread, it's the only one I can eat and I paid for it myself\" is scolding someone now?
