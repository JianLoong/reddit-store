My dad died when I was 5, mom met my stepdad when I was 7 and they got married when I was 8. My stepdad had two kids under 2 at the time. Their mom was not in their lives.\n\nI was never \"yay my mom's getting married\" about it. I was also never \"yay a new/another dad\". It was always just something that was happening and I could accept that. But was I *happy* or *excited?* Not really. I don't think my mom and stepdad marrying is the best thing to happen to me and I also don't really care if he has been around longer than my dad has been at this point (I'm 15). It doesn't mean I think of him as my dad or his kids as siblings without the step.\n\nBut they see me as just their sister, not their stepsister. They both say they have two siblings (counting me) and they call me their sister to others. They always say mom and I were the best thing to happen to them because they know mom, while mom to them, is not their bio mom.\n\nMy stepsiblings suggested a few weeks ago that we celebrate mom and stepdad's wedding anniversary as the best day ever and the day our family became a family for real. They were all excited and said it was the perfect way to celebrate the best thing to happen to our family. My mom and stepdad told them it was an awesome idea and hyped them up. I was not hype and I had no enthusiasm for the idea at all. My stepsiblings were upset and asked me if I hated the idea and why wasn't I excited like they all were. My mom glared at me over their heads and my stepdad was staring at me. I told them it wasn't something I really felt like celebrating but would join for them. It didn't help and my stepsiblings were more upset wondering why I wasn't totally into the idea.\n\nMy mom and stepdad told me I could've and should've faked some enthusiasm for my stepsiblings because now they are asking them if I'm unhappy that we became a family. I also heard my stepsister ask mom if I had never wanted to be her and her brother's sister.\n\nThe day after that question got asked I was told yet again how wrong I was.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703010794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m8vpu/aita_for_not_faking_enthusiasm_for_my_stepsiblings/", "score": 328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is all you need to say. You do not need to elaborate.

The AH is your mom (and somewhat your stepdad) for not stepping up as the adults and explaining to the younger kids that it's ok for people to feel differently or to simply not be enthusiastic. \n\nKids are influenced a lot by those close to them, and if your mom and stepdad are acting like there is something wrong with you for simply having your own perspective then the younger kids will follow suit.", "Tell your parents that you can do things like pretend Santa is real *if they give a heads up and everyone understands that you're going along instead of believing.* Their assumption that if course you'll lie is not good for anyone. \n\nNTA", "NTA \u201cThe wedding happened because my Dad died. I am happy to have everyone in my life but the wedding brings up a lot of emotions for me because my Dad had to die for the wedding to happen.\u201d", "NTA, and neither are your stepsiblings. It sounds like your mom and stepdad have failed all of you by not doing a better job of explaining to your stepsiblings that everyone can feel differently about things, and it's ok. That said, there probably were better ways of saying what you did, because that kind of does sound like you think it was a bad thing they got married. Something like \"I'm happy to join you with it, but it's not something I'm excited for like you are.\" But I don't think you were around, and it's hard to figure out how to word things on the spot", "NTA.

Are you unhappy that you all became a family? Do you not want them as your step-siblings? \n\nA step-parent and step-siblings are still immediate family members and still an important relationship. Of course a step-parent is *never a replacement for one's parent; it remains a significant relationship- you dictate the boundaries of, you can be as close or distant as you choose (depending on how good a person the step-parent is to begin with, obviously if they are a jerk, the relationship isn't going to be close). \n\nSame goes for your step-siblings, but they are kids and it's kind of lovely that they view you as a sibling without the \"step.\" With the parent, I can see how that would never change, but with the kids, is there a reason why you don't feel open to forming a bond with them or seeing them as siblings? I'm not saying you are wrong - there's no wrong - it's how you feel and that's legitimate, I'm just asking. Also for both your sake and theirs it might be helpful to know the answer to this and find a non-hurtful way to explain it to them someday.... Maybe... Also maybe not, it's possible nothing good could come from them knowing that you don't see them that way. \n\nI don't think you are wrong for not feeling enthusiastic about the anniversary, but I see how maybe not faking the enthusiasm makes your step-siblings feel hurt. I don't think that makes you an AH, but perhaps try to be sensitive to their feelings too.", "NTA", "NTA. It is better for your mother and step dad to be forced to have a difficult conversation with the kids now about the unique nature of your family than lead them to believe a falsehood and then getting blindsided later after thinking you were close siblings all this time.", "NTA\n\nI think you being forced to perform emotions for other people's comfort would be super unhealthy and unfair to you. As long as you recognize that your siblings have done nothing wrong, and their feelings deserve gentleness and care.", "You could always tell them to \"curb your enthusiasm\".\n\n:-)\n\nI don't know what they expect... you're 15.  15 year olds generally aren't enthusiastic about what their family wants them to be enthusiastic about, and are enthusiastic about things their families wish they weren't.\n\nNTA OP.", "NAH.\n\nYour family is excited about the event, but you are not.

You're also 15; there's going to be a *lot* of celebrations you'll see people do that you won't get the point of or won't be excited about, and for your age that is perfectly normal.\n\nThere is some need for family counselling on this issue, so that communication can be improved and your parents can come to understand that, well, you're just being normal. But at the same time, nothing about this suggests anyone crossed a line into being an AH; this is just normal family conflicts.", "NTA you don't have to enjoy it and you don't have to pretend you enjoy it", "NTA. It sounds like your mother, in her rush to \"move on\", disregarded you and your feelings. \n\nIn your household, are you permitted to remember your father, to talk about him, or to have mementos of him?

You are still a kid yourself. You should not be carrying these burdens.", "NTA.  People truly wonder why the concept of family is in the gutter.  OP\u2019s mom and her husband want OP to fake feelings OP doesn\u2019t have.  \u201cWe\u2019re family, you have to do anything for family\u201d is probably the mindset they\u2019re using but that completely discounts the fact that OP doesn\u2019t view them as family.

You are not an AH for not having the enthusiasm of tweens on a mission. \n\nYou are not wrong. Your feelings are valid and it isn't your responsibility to fake it for your step siblings.  I would turn it around on them and say 'so you are happy your own mother died then?'  \n\nYour parents are AHs for expecting you to whip up positive feelings on this topic IMO.", "NTA\n\nFirst, I am very sorry for you loss. Second, it might help to sit them down without the adults and discuss things. You can care about them you could even love all of them dearly but they only came into your life because you lost your dad. That's a huge loss that will always be with you and shape you. While you can appreciate the love their father brought your mom and care about them your family exists because you had a profound loss so it will always feel a little different to you than to them. That's not bad. That doesn't invalidate whatever connection you have or somehow make them less. It's just different.", "NTA cuz those feelings are valid, but they will hurt your family in the long run. My half sister was in your shoes. She ghosted my dad as soon as she was 18 (he adopted her when my parent got married and she was also 8 with no dad in the picture). Tbh it tore my family apart and my parents ended up divorced. My fondest memories are of my entire family together and to her it was all meaningless and now that will never happen again except *maybe* at my funeral someday. My sister said she would not even go to my wedding if my dad is there so I\u2019ve decided to not have a wedding and just elope (and it hurts everyone in my family except my sister but she doesnt care). I try not to be resentful but in all honesty everytime she asks me to come for her kids celebrations I don\u2019t go because why would I? She doesn\u2019t come to my family shit.", "NTA\n\nYour stepsibilings are like 8 and 9 or thereabouts.  They are little kids who have been groomed by your mom and stepdad to feel the way that they feel.\n\nIt's not wrong and your mom is the only mom they have known.  But they have no right to insist on how you should feel.\n\nI like the suggestion of saying that you can't get too excited about something that reminds you of your dad's death.  The stepsiblings sound like they were too young to remember their mom.. but you weren't too young to remember your dad.  They are just different situations and someone needs to tell them that.. multiple times...", "NTA\n\nYou are entitled to your feelings, as they are to theirs.", "NTA - you are a kid who lost your parent, and sounds like your mom never even considered your feelings when she decided to remarry.", "NTA and them just calling it wrong shows they are AHs. You are fine having your own feelings and they shouldn't be led to think everything is perfect when you LOST YOUR FATHER. As someone whose dad was killed, so happy my mom never forced her boyfriends into a father role or replace him.", "I'm torn between NTA and NAH. I honestly don't think it's really my place to judge, because I've never gone through anything like this in my life.\n\nI will say, your stepsiblings have know you and your mom practically their whole lives. They probably don't really remember life without you or your mom. I get why you wouldn't want to celebrate something like this, but it would be kind of you to extend some kind of olive branch towards your stepsiblings.", "Nta", "NTA.", "NTA.

I mean honestly you could have said \"that sounds nice\" with a smile. How much energy would that have cost you? These kids are about 8-10 so they won't act kindly by pure naivety much longer. What will you do at 18/19, coming back home after having moved out when there are two new teenagers in that house who know you don't see them as family? Good luck I say. Basically, yeah you don't HAVE to care, but in 5 years you'll probably wish you'd given at least the bare minimum. You are a teenager, it is given you can't see the bigger picture but just.....try to try.", "I\u2019m going with a gentle NTA but. You are 15 and I\u2019m sorry to say that as a teenager you want autonomy and do not emphasize with what your younger step siblings feel due to being the eldest and most hormonal right now. There is no bad guy here, you have the right to feel the way you do just remember that everything you do and say now may be held against you when you\u2019re older. your stepdad is probably helping to fund your life, that\u2019s what parents do.", "I can't believe I'm going to say this but YTA.   \nIt's not because you don't want to celebrate the marriage as \"the best thing to ever happen to you\". I get that completely.  \nBut you sound so cold and indifferent to these kids who have been in your life since they were under 2. They only know you as the sister that they grew up with.

You don't need to see your step siblings as sisters but they were under 2 when they met you so won't have any memories where you weren't around.  Also they are under 10 by the sounds of it so are still young children.  \n\nHave a bit of empathy.", "To be honest, I'm between YTA and NAH.\n\nIt's ok if you don't feel super excited about things, about this it's an YNA, but I thought the lack of pretense was kind of stupid... Like, your step brothers are still small children and they truly believe that you are *family.* It wouldn't hurt to be a little excited, even though it's fake. Sometimes, in life, it is necessary to make some \"sacrifice\". \n\nEnjoy your family that is apparently harmonious, believe me when I say that this is rare, the moment your stepfather and step brothers notice your indifference the house can become a truly hell to live in (I go in the direction of \"mood\", it can be a strange and uncomfortable environment).", "YTA - look at how good the young ones are at faking it, be more like them.", "You also have to realize that the wedding did happen, whether you liked it or not. They are married and they are each other\u2019s family, period. If you\u2019re gonna say you aren\u2019t happy they are married then there will probably be consequences to that statement. They are married and it\u2019s their money, I image you\u2019re happy to use their money but when they deny you a car next year bc of how you\u2019re treating your moms family (her husband and I assume financial contributor to the family) know it\u2019s probably bc of how you\u2019re acting now.
