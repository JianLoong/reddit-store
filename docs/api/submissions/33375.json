It was always just something that was happening and I could accept that. But was I *happy* or *excited?* Not really. I don't think my mom and stepdad marrying is the best thing to happen to me and I also don't really care if he has been around longer than my dad has been at this point (I'm 15). It doesn't mean I think of him as my dad or his kids as siblings without the step.\n\nBut they see me as just their sister, not their stepsister. They both say they have two siblings (counting me) and they call me their sister to others. They always say mom and I were the best thing to happen to them because they know mom, while mom to them, is not their bio mom.\n\nMy stepsiblings suggested a few weeks ago that we celebrate mom and stepdad's wedding anniversary as the best day ever and the day our family became a family for real. They were all excited and said it was the perfect way to celebrate the best thing to happen to our family. My mom and stepdad told them it was an awesome idea and hyped them up. I was not hype and I had no enthusiasm for the idea at all. My stepsiblings were upset and asked me if I hated the idea and why wasn't I excited like they all were. My mom glared at me over their heads and my stepdad was staring at me. I told them it wasn't something I really felt like celebrating but would join for them. It didn't help and my stepsiblings were more upset wondering why I wasn't totally into the idea.\n\nMy mom and stepdad told me I could've and should've faked some enthusiasm for my stepsiblings because now they are asking them if I'm unhappy that we became a family. I also heard my stepsister ask mom if I had never wanted to be her and her brother's sister.\n\nThe day after that question got asked I was told yet again how wrong I was.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703010794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m8vpu/aita_for_not_faking_enthusiasm_for_my_stepsiblings/", "score": 598, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, your step brothers are still small children and they truly believe that you are *family.* It wouldn't hurt to be a little excited, even though it's fake. Sometimes, in life, it is necessary to make some \"sacrifice\". \n\nEnjoy your family that is apparently harmonious, believe me when I say that this is rare, the moment your stepfather and step brothers notice your indifference the house can become a truly hell to live in (I go in the direction of \"mood\", it can be a strange and uncomfortable environment).", "YTA - look at how good the young ones are at faking it, be more like them.", "You also have to realize that the wedding did happen, whether you liked it or not. They are married and they are each other\u2019s family, period. If you\u2019re gonna say you aren\u2019t happy they are married then there will probably be consequences to that statement.

When she got married, she should have talked to you about it first, because that decision affected your life too.

The stepsiblings are young enough not to have a full grasp of why that's such a fraught statement for OP, but their mom and stepfather sure as hell know.  The problem is that they don't care how much it affects OP.  For the stepsiblings \"best thing\" to happen, OP had to have their own \"worst thing\" happen.  (Sorry, OP, I'm unclear on your gender or pronouns.)\n\nNow, for all we know, OP's mom and dad had a troubled marriage or were thinking about separating or something, but that does not affect OP's relationship with or memory of their dad.  OP's mom has found happiness again, which is a good thing.  To expect, no to demand, that OP feel it's for the best is rather disgusting.\n\nOP cannot count on their own mom to help or comfort or have their back in any way.  It's as if OP's mom and stepfather have both tried to erase OP's dad from the picture entirely.  The teen years are hard enough with conflicting emotions and trying to find one's place in the world.  Adding the burden of being expected to fake essentially being happy their dad died is a step too far, IMO.\n\nOP is NTA.  The stepsiblings are obviously not AHs either, but both the adults sure are.", "I actually think OP was quite kind here, while also being honest. She said that she doesn\u2019t want to celebrate it (true) but she would for them (supportive). Meanwhile her mum and stepdad are getting mad at her for upsetting the other kids? Maybe they need to get mad at themselves for hyping the kids up without considering how OP was clearly going to feel about it.", "Definitely agree. OP, you deserve the right to feel however you want about your stepsiblings, the marriage, and the entire ordeal. Nonetheless, you've been in their lives forever, and they consider you a blood sibling. That's more than what others could say, and it wouldn't hurt to just say something nice despite actually feeling something different. If you put in an ounce of effort to see your siblings like they see you, I guarantee you wouldn't be as bitter as you seem right now. That's not to say that you aren't in the right, but sometimes compromise leads to better outcomes than being \"right,\" despite what the rest of the comments have to say.", "Thank you. People always say NTA on these scenarios but just because you can be mean doesn't mean you should be. I feel like people on this board lack basic empathy for other people. Those kids have only none you as their sister since they were babies. I don't think it would kill you to show some enthusiasm for them. They don't know any different and that's not their fault.", "\"But then you got Dad as *your* new dad! Why aren't you happy about that? Don't you love Dad?!\"\n\nI've seen way too many teens here post this exact reaction from their step/half-siblings that it's almost exhausting. OP, it's highly likely that you'll be having this argument even into your adulthood. Your step-dad is probably expecting to do every father/daughter milestone with you, upto and including wedding things like walking you down the aisle and a first dance.\n\nBecause we also get dozens of posts from grown adults still having issues with the overbearing expectations from their parent and step-parent, and weddings are when these issues seem to pop up all over again.\n\nI'd say family therapy is something y'all should look into, but too many kids get signed up and browbeaten towards accepting the family blend rather than setting reasonable and healthy boundaries that would be in the kid's best interest.\n\nFrankly, OP, you're likely going to have to grin and bear this until you become financially independent from your family.", "No, she doesn't have to lie, but she does have an obligation to make an effort.", "Lol so you have never had teenage kids then.", "Yeah, I think YTA.\n\nI get it, you didn't want you mother to remarry. What about what your mother wanted? Oh, I get it, she should just wallow in your own misery and not get on with her life, right?\n\nLook, life sucks sometimes and we don't love the hand we are dealt, but FFS, drop the petulant teenager act and get on board. My dad died and it wrecked me. I know it sucks, but your mother didn't kill him, and neither did your step dad.\n\nI think you're entitled and acting like a brat and you should *try* to treat those around you with a little more kindness and respect rather than feeling like you can do your own thing because you never asked for any of this. NO ONE EVER FUCKING ASKS FOR IT!\n\nOh look, you have a loving family who obviously think the world of you - you poor thing!", "Yeah, you don't have to force a relationship, but you should make the effort. OP is refusing to even do that."]}
