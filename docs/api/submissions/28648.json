Tell the delivery room staff that the only person you want in the delivery room other than medical personnel is your husband. They'll keep out the riff raff.", "NTA\n\nYou are the person giving birth. You get to decide whose presence in the birth room you would find supportive and whose presence you would find distracting or inhibiting.\n\nSomeone can be a great friend and an awesome person, but you don't want them present when you're giving birth, because they don't have the calm, supportive manner that you want. And that's OK.\n\nThis is about you, and about the support that you would find helpful. Birth is not a spectator sport.", "NTA at all. The birth is all about you and the baby. Any steps to make you comfortable and stress-free should be taken.", "NTA.  You've said \"no\" and she isn't listening.  Your husband needs to shut her down once and for all.  He should just tell her that her continuing to bring it up is just adding more unneeded stress.", "NTA it should be you and your partner, or your call who is in there. We didn\u2019t want our parents in the room, because it was our moment, and also:blood, fluids, pain. Like, who wants to see their kids all stirrup\u2019d up?", "NTA. The next time she brings it up, ask her \u201chow is this respecting my decision?\u201d", "Of course NTA\n\nYour time delivering your baby will be intense. \n\nIt\u2019s a once in a lifetime experience, so it makes sense that your MIL wants to be there to witness the birth, but it\u2019s also a special ,intimate experience that you can and should be able to experience with just your husband ( and obviously medical personnel) if you wish.", "NTA   \n\n\nNo means no. The act of giving birth is incredibly personal. It's hard thing for a woman to go through. No one should be in the room with you that you don't want there. You will have to find a way to talk to her to shut down the guilt trips so you don't get stressed out as the time comes.   \n\n\nThe last thing you want is your MIL there who already doesn't respect this boundary. What is to stop her from taking pictures/videos of the birth that you may not want?

I hope you and your husband are ready for her trying to boundary stomp all over your post partum period. She has already shown that she doesn't respect you.", "NTA.\n\nFirst, remember that child birth is a medical procedure. Don't feel bad saying \"no\". Besides, given how nosy she is, do you think for one second she would be able to stop herself from looking at your crotch every chance she gets because she wants to see if the baby is crowning?

Grandparents don't have a \"right\" to be there. It's not up to her to \"respect\" your decision. Have medical staff forcibly remove her if she crosses those boundaries (and it sounds like she just might). Childbirth is difficult, scary, potentially dangerous, and for a lot of it you will be exposed. You have a right to feel as comfortable as possible in this situation.

Shut down the repeated requests with \"asked and answered\" then change the subject.  Is your DH backing you up?\n\nNow would be a good time to write up a list of 'rules' for your birth and postpartum time and text or post it on Facebook it to both sides of the family.  Mark my words, if you can finally get it thru her head that she will NOT be in the delivery room, she will start demanding to stay with you after the birth to hlep.\n\nBeing nosy and intrusive cancels out any love, kindness and helpfulness.

From my point of view, I would NEVER ask or demand that I be in the labor and delivery room.  If she wants me there, she can ask.  \n\nI have been present during several births as a support person, and I have six children of my own.  Not that it matters at all with anything my DIL chooses.  \n\nNTA and your MIL needs to stop the crap.", "NTA. She can wait in the waiting room if she\u2019s that desperate to meet her grandchild.\n\nAlso, without giving you tmi, I had fairly quick and easy births. Not all labours are horror story material. Good luck and enjoy your new baby!", "Birth is not a spectator sport. She knows that. Ask her if she tells you gross details if she wants to see you in this position? Why does she want to see your hooha so bad?", "NTA\n\nThe only person you are REQUIRED to allow at the birth is the baby. Anyone else is just extra. (Although I do encourage medical staff being present lol)\n\n\nBut I would like to add that birth is absolutely disgusting.

It can't be said on this forum enough \"Birth is NOT a spectator sport\".  And stop feeling bad for shutting her down.", "NTA but I'm confused. Why didn't the father of your child shut her down the second time she asked? WHy do YOU have to do the work to get overbearing, boundary-stomping MIL to back off and stop harassing you??", "NTA,\n\nYou do not owe her anything because this is the only grandchild.", "If your husband doesn't have the balls to shut her down, then ask the. Doctor to do it. Why do people expect to be in the delivery room without being asked,? This is not a movie, it is a serious procedure. But out!", "NTA.  Your MIL has no rights or entitlement to be in the delivery room.  It\u2019s your birth and your child so it\u2019s under your rules.  It may be time to be completely blunt with MIL about no meaning no and to stop being nosey and pushy.", "NTA - It's the birth of your child.  That's a full stop.  It's going to be a day you remember for the rest of your life, it's going to be both the most wonderful and painful days in your life.  Set up your attack plan and execute it.\n\nIf there is a way to communicate with your MIL about expectations and have an adult conversation with her about what you need from your crew on the day, great.  Maybe there is a way you can add her to the team.\n\nNTA, especially if it feels like she's going to make an already extremely hard challenge even tougher.", "NTA at all. I have never seen anything like what's going on right now with pushy MILs trying to intrude in their grandchild's delivery. Is it a virus? You could not have paid my MIL to be in the room for any of her g'kid's births, and she was very loving, very into newborns. She just didn't need to be up in that mess. I had the honor of being asked to be my youngest daughter's birth coach\u2014her partner couldn't be\u2014we went to classes together and all\u2014but when she went into labor she had a friend come over \u2014my husband and I are a four hour drive away, and she thought, oh I will be in labor for a long time, no need to wake my parents up yet. Wrong. She finally called us, we threw a week's worth of clothes in a suitcase and started driving\u2014I got into the birthing room 15 minutes before g'son was born. Daughter's friend coached her, and she did great, she was like a sport's coach, rooting her through every contraction, and daughter was having a really good birthing experience. Even though I was up on what was going to happen, how they do things \"nowadays,\" I am older, and it was actually probably better that she had her friend there. But IMO, if you are gonna be in that room at all, the mother giving birth needs to have ASKED you to be there!!! You do not ask her, much less push for it. She asks you.", "NTA at all.  You\u2019re the one giving birth, so you\u2019re the patient.", "NTA- Birth isn\u2019t a spectator sport. Are you invited to her old lady bits checkups? Right now, stop the feeling bad. That\u2019s how she gets her way. No is a complete sentence without guilt or strings.", "Giving birth is not a spectator sport.", "This, 100%. NTA.", "Also let the labor and delivery nurses know she is not allowed in no matter what.  They will keep her out", "Exactly this. Nobody fucks with delivery nurses twice. \n\nAs an added thought, discuss with the maternity ward where you plan to deliver how and when visitors will be welcome after delivery."]}
