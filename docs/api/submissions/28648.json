I have never seen anything like what's going on right now with pushy MILs trying to intrude in their grandchild's delivery. Is it a virus? You could not have paid my MIL to be in the room for any of her g'kid's births, and she was very loving, very into newborns. She just didn't need to be up in that mess. I had the honor of being asked to be my youngest daughter's birth coach\u2014her partner couldn't be\u2014we went to classes together and all\u2014but when she went into labor she had a friend come over \u2014my husband and I are a four hour drive away, and she thought, oh I will be in labor for a long time, no need to wake my parents up yet. Wrong. She finally called us, we threw a week's worth of clothes in a suitcase and started driving\u2014I got into the birthing room 15 minutes before g'son was born. Daughter's friend coached her, and she did great, she was like a sport's coach, rooting her through every contraction, and daughter was having a really good birthing experience. Even though I was up on what was going to happen, how they do things \"nowadays,\" I am older, and it was actually probably better that she had her friend there. But IMO, if you are gonna be in that room at all, the mother giving birth needs to have ASKED you to be there!!! You do not ask her, much less push for it. She asks you.", "NTA at all.

You are going through a medical procedure. Its not a spectator sport.", "NTA! \n\nAlso, if you are doing a hospital birth I would 100% use the excuse that the hospital is limiting visitors.", "NTA- I just exploded at my MIL yesterday because she\u2019s the same type. We have an 11 week old now and were on okayish terms before the birth but the intrusiveness just got so intense since the last trimester up to now that I full on exploded.

Make sure you tell all the doctors and nurses that you do not want anyone apart from your husband in the room. This situation is nothing new to them, and they have procedures in place. Also be sure to let them know that your husband cannot change that decision on his own either.

My MIL didn\u2019t once ask to be in the delivery room when I had my child with my husband, nor has she asked to be in it with my current baby that\u2019s due next month.

Please nip this in the bud with your MIL, politely and firmly say thanks for the offer but it\u2019s a NO thank you. \n\nAfter the birth of my daughter, my MIL drove to the hospital and immediately took advantage of the fact that I was asleep. I was exhausted after a long (very difficult) labour. The hospital I was in was a tiny local unit. My MIL somehow managed to convince the hospital staff that I had arranged for her to take my baby out for a walk in the pram. They were told not to wake me up, but let me rest. They actually allowed my MIL to take my baby daughter out of the hospital. She apparently took my daughter to her place of work to show her off to her work colleagues. I woke up alone in my room. Immediate panic ensued, and I managed to alert the staff. They then panicked as they told me what my MIL had done. They told me to wait in my room while they tried to find my MIL. I can\u2019t describe how horrifying those moments were. I didn\u2019t know where my baby was. Then the hospital room door opened, my MIL marched in pushing a pram. She didn\u2019t look at me at all. Instead my baby was screaming and crying. MIL said \u201cfeed your baby she\u2019s upset because she\u2019s starving!\u201d Then turned and angrily walked out. \n\nThat was one incident involving my MIL. There were so many through the years. \n\nSadly some family members are simply toxic. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for protecting yourself, protecting your children, protecting your mental health, protecting your personal boundaries. You chose to have a baby with her son. That doesn\u2019t automatically give her rights to you, your child, or your life. Respect is earned and trust is given after time (not automatically). Be brave and kindly set your own boundaries with your MIL.", "NTA\n\nThe decision is made. It's a medical procedure not a spectator sport.

I said no- I wanted to be with my new family unit, in those precious first moments and she made it about what she wanted.
