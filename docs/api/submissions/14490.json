{"id": 14490, "submission_id": "12hx0md", "title": "AITA for basically telling my brother that I don't blame his GF for leaving him?", "selftext": "My (32f) brother (34) had been dating 32yo \"Jane\" for like 10 or 11 years. In the beginning the whole family absolutely adored her but over time (maybe 3 years ago) Jane became kind of bitchy and distant and none of understood why. She wouldn't answer us when we asked so we, admittedly, kind of just avoided her honestly. She blocked everyone off everything, stopped going to family events, etc. I know I personally started really hating her (for personal reasons, as the only person she ever acknowledged was my husband and she was flirty and it didnt set well with me).\n\nHowever.. my brother shows up here completely tanked last night saying Jane left him. During his visit he started opening up on the \"why\" aspect and informed me that when Jane was like 23 she expressed wanting to get married and wanted to have babies and what not. Something none of us knew (we thought they were child free by choice, as that's what my brother told all of us). He said to me that he told her if she loved him she would wait until he got his shit together. So she apparently waited around for years, just waiting on him, before he finally told her last week that he didn't want kids or to get married and that he was comfortable with the life he has currently. So, she left. He expressed that around the time that she started acting really cunty to the rest of the family was because during that time I was pregnant and she couldn't stand being around me. He also very bluntly said \"she wanted your husband and talked about him all the time because she knew he wanted kids and I was holding out\" and he had apparently been the reason she blocked us all because of her comments about my husband. But looking back now... It makes a lot of sense. \n\nAnyways, at the end of the conversation I said that I can understand why she left. I told him I understand him as well and his reasoning behind not wanting kids or marriage but if it was that important to her, I can totally see why she left. Especially where he made the promise of \"when I get my shit together\", just to tell her years later that he basically lied and never wanted kids or marriage. So she probably feels like he wasted her time. I made a point to tell him I understood both sides but he chalked this up to me agreeing with Jane and said that \"women shouldn't always stick together you know. I'm your fucking family and Jane left the love we had behind over potential kids and a piece of paper\". That wasn't what I was trying to say but regardless my husband did tell me later on that I should have just not said what I said, regardless of how true it was.

Your brother doesn't suck for not wanting those things, but he sucks so hard for leading Jane on and then acting like he is the one with any right to be hurt.

I know he's your brother but telling someone you love an occasional harsh truth is not wrong.", "NTA, your brother is though.  He knew years ago he never wanted to get married or have kids.  Knowing that his gf did he should never have strung her along. I would also doubt what your brother said about her wanting your husband being the reason she acted like that towards your family.  She was most likely jealous of your having a baby but was coming to terms with the fact that the man she loved was never going to allow her a marriage or a baby.  Your brother needs to grow up and your husband needs to stay out of it. If nobody is honest with your brother then he's going to go thru life lying to everyone.

Sometimes people have different wants and relationships don't work out because of that.", "NTA- he wasted her time. You were being honest about it. I pretty much always say to defend family, but his actions caused her to leave.

You, your family and Jane deserved better.", "NTA, OP. This isn't even about you. Your brother is a major asshole. Like, off the charts.

He lied to her for a decade just so that he could keep her to himself when he *knew* that she wouldn\u2019t stay with him otherwise. He stole a decade of her life.

What a jerk.", "wellllll you might've waited a little bit before being so direct, lol.  he was upset, and he's allowed to be upset, and he also needed someone to talk to.  people need that kind of space, especially right after a breakup.  so i don't think what you said was wrong at all, i just think your timing was off.  very, very tiny AH.", "YTA Good for having empathy but she sounds awful for taking her personal issues out on you. It was her choice to stay or not, and that was between her and your brother. He did sound misleading, but I mean, give him a chance to recover before telling him it\u2019s all his fault.", "Well, you telling him right away was a bit like adding salt to the wound. But you are right about the reasons she left him.\n\nYTA, but very minor one. You could've waited at least few days before you drop this kind of bomb on him. But since he lead her on for years and lied to her, I have hard time sympathizing with him, because in my eyes he is the real AH of this story.", "I'm going to go YTA. \n\nLook, I think at 24 many people really aren't sure whether they want kids or not.  He may have thought he would want them when he was more settled in his life, and got there.  And this isn't to defend him, because maybe he know mostly he didn't, but thought things may change (I have many friends in their mid to late 30s, and their opinions on kids have definitely changed, in both directions).  \n\nHowever there are 2 things.  First, the fact that she was a jerk to your entire family because you were pregnant is bad enough, but the fact that she blatantly told your brother that she wanted your husband.  That is wild.  That alone should have made you sympathize with him. \n\nBut, moreso, this is your brother.  He came over to vent and commisserate with someone he thought he could talk to.   I have a feeling that if one of your female friends came over crying because their long term boyfriend dumped them, you wouldn't say \"well, i honestly see both sides\".   Even if you do, that just isn't something you say to someone right away.  In time, when its less raw, you can definitely mention that.  But the fact that he was clearly torn up, and you had to both sides it, makes you seem pretty unsupportive.", "YTA but your right, I wouldn't have said it personally but i would've wanted to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its more likely you'll have to give birth before the due date to avoid complications.\n\nThe risk for the baby also rises after 35.

Many women in the ttc community feel lied to because they were told by society that 1) birth control has no long term side effects, false. Many women find that their cycles take a year to return to normal if they ever do regulate. 2) they can wait until their mid thirties to start trying, they can, and some have success, but many do not.

But my point is that we don\u2019t know the brothers intention. The outcome doesn\u2019t reflect his intent over a 7yr relationship.
