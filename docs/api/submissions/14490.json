In the beginning the whole family absolutely adored her but over time (maybe 3 years ago) Jane became kind of bitchy and distant and none of understood why. She wouldn't answer us when we asked so we, admittedly, kind of just avoided her honestly. She blocked everyone off everything, stopped going to family events, etc. I know I personally started really hating her (for personal reasons, as the only person she ever acknowledged was my husband and she was flirty and it didnt set well with me).\n\nHowever.. my brother shows up here completely tanked last night saying Jane left him. During his visit he started opening up on the \"why\" aspect and informed me that when Jane was like 23 she expressed wanting to get married and wanted to have babies and what not. Something none of us knew (we thought they were child free by choice, as that's what my brother told all of us). He said to me that he told her if she loved him she would wait until he got his shit together. So she apparently waited around for years, just waiting on him, before he finally told her last week that he didn't want kids or to get married and that he was comfortable with the life he has currently. So, she left. He expressed that around the time that she started acting really cunty to the rest of the family was because during that time I was pregnant and she couldn't stand being around me. He also very bluntly said \"she wanted your husband and talked about him all the time because she knew he wanted kids and I was holding out\" and he had apparently been the reason she blocked us all because of her comments about my husband. But looking back now... It makes a lot of sense. \n\nAnyways, at the end of the conversation I said that I can understand why she left. I told him I understand him as well and his reasoning behind not wanting kids or marriage but if it was that important to her, I can totally see why she left. Especially where he made the promise of \"when I get my shit together\", just to tell her years later that he basically lied and never wanted kids or marriage. So she probably feels like he wasted her time. I made a point to tell him I understood both sides but he chalked this up to me agreeing with Jane and said that \"women shouldn't always stick together you know. I'm your fucking family and Jane left the love we had behind over potential kids and a piece of paper\". That wasn't what I was trying to say but regardless my husband did tell me later on that I should have just not said what I said, regardless of how true it was.

Your brother doesn't suck for not wanting those things, but he sucks so hard for leading Jane on and then acting like he is the one with any right to be hurt.

I know he's your brother but telling someone you love an occasional harsh truth is not wrong.", "NTA, your brother is though.  He knew years ago he never wanted to get married or have kids.  Knowing that his gf did he should never have strung her along. I would also doubt what your brother said about her wanting your husband being the reason she acted like that towards your family.  She was most likely jealous of your having a baby but was coming to terms with the fact that the man she loved was never going to allow her a marriage or a baby.  Your brother needs to grow up and your husband needs to stay out of it. If nobody is honest with your brother then he's going to go thru life lying to everyone.

Sometimes people have different wants and relationships don't work out because of that.", "NTA- he wasted her time. You were being honest about it. I pretty much always say to defend family, but his actions caused her to leave.

He lied to her for a decade just so that he could keep her to himself when he *knew* that she wouldn\u2019t stay with him otherwise. He stole a decade of her life.

What a jerk.", "wellllll you might've waited a little bit before being so direct, lol.  he was upset, and he's allowed to be upset, and he also needed someone to talk to.  people need that kind of space, especially right after a breakup.  so i don't think what you said was wrong at all, i just think your timing was off.  very, very tiny AH.", "YTA Good for having empathy but she sounds awful for taking her personal issues out on you. It was her choice to stay or not, and that was between her and your brother. He did sound misleading, but I mean, give him a chance to recover before telling him it\u2019s all his fault.", "Well, you telling him right away was a bit like adding salt to the wound. But you are right about the reasons she left him.\n\nYTA, but very minor one. You could've waited at least few days before you drop this kind of bomb on him. But since he lead her on for years and lied to her, I have hard time sympathizing with him, because in my eyes he is the real AH of this story.", "I'm going to go YTA. \n\nLook, I think at 24 many people really aren't sure whether they want kids or not.  He may have thought he would want them when he was more settled in his life, and got there.  And this isn't to defend him, because maybe he know mostly he didn't, but thought things may change (I have many friends in their mid to late 30s, and their opinions on kids have definitely changed, in both directions).  \n\nHowever there are 2 things.  First, the fact that she was a jerk to your entire family because you were pregnant is bad enough, but the fact that she blatantly told your brother that she wanted your husband.  That is wild.  That alone should have made you sympathize with him. \n\nBut, moreso, this is your brother.  He came over to vent and commisserate with someone he thought he could talk to.   I have a feeling that if one of your female friends came over crying because their long term boyfriend dumped them, you wouldn't say \"well, i honestly see both sides\".   Even if you do, that just isn't something you say to someone right away.  In time, when its less raw, you can definitely mention that.  But the fact that he was clearly torn up, and you had to both sides it, makes you seem pretty unsupportive.", "YTA but your right, I wouldn't have said it personally but i would've wanted to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's not an ethical individual.", "Watch your husband OP /s", "NTA (your brother and his GF both are). you've illustrated why your brother is TA quite well and i agree with you. i only think GF is TA for flirting with your husband, that's not OK regardless of what your brother was up to. OP not TA to be clear", "NTA\n\nYour brother is though. I am child-free by choice. Every partner I've been serious with knows this right at the beginning. No, I'm not changing my mind and yes I'm sure. To string her along like that for years is a horrible thing to do and he deserves to be called out for it.", "Nta, and tbh no one can blame jane either. She was a good person before your stupid brother messed her up. She was trying to make him jealous by using your husband as a bait, girls do that where we know we actually have no chance but it's safe because this person won't flirt back. Your brother wasted her 11 yrs and it will be more years before she actually gets over the damage he has done to her mental health. You were right, you should've been more harsh because he's an AH, who needs to be called out. I wish jane all the best in her life and hope she never takes him.back and he never gets the love he has lost. Nta", "NTA. Poor Jane.", "I wouldn't trust your brothers retelling here that she \"wanted your husband\".\n\nYour brother actively chose to LIE to his partner for close to a decade and waste her best years promising her that she just had to \"wait until he got his shit together\" and he would give her marriage and children. Only to reveal that he is a user and a deceiver. He is not a reliable person to trust. Period. So don't believe his version of events. \n\nNTA for calling him out on wasting her time. Being blood related doesn't mean you can't call him out for actively choosing to destroy someones life and then act the victim over it.", "NTA, just because he\u2019s your brother, doesn\u2019t mean you have to side with him.", "She wanted a marriage and children. She agreed to a time frame for your brother and when he finally got his life together he revealed exactly what he wanted. At best she was misled but to Jane she was lied to for almost a decade. NTA. They had fundamental differences that love can not overcome.", "NTA I'm child free and your brother is an AH. Lying to someone and wasting their time is pure selfish. Tell that AH he crapped all over the love she had for him with a load of lies he doled out over years consistently. She was at least honest. He didn't love her and want her happy. He loves being comfortable and keeping his options open if something better comes along and that is the only thing that matters to him.", "My ex pulled that crap, he\u2019s an an ex too.", "Nta. He didn\u2019t love her, he lied to her and didn\u2019t let her look for what she wanted", "NTA it was pretty clear he disregarded that entire perspective.  Also, acknowledging or understanding why she left is not necessarily the same as taking her side.", "NTA you are absolutely right! Women do have this whole biological clock thing and she wasted 10 years of her child bearing time with somebody who was never going to have kids with her! And she wouldn't have wasted 10 years if he had just told her that in the beginning! He lied to her, he strung her along and now he is upset that she left when she found out the truth? Of course you understand that! EVERYBODY understands that but him!", "NTA. That manipulative asshole just took many of her prime childbearing years away from her because he lied to her.  What a selfish fucking jerk. I would have torn him a new one.", "Your brother is a huge AH. \u201cThrew their love away over some potential kids and a piece of paper\u201d. No marriage and/or esp children is a dealbreaker for lots of people, not just Jane. He should\u2019ve told her this years ago instead of stringing her along for over a decade. He\u2019s a colossal, selfish AHOLE. And \u201cfamily sticking with family\u201d means maybe you don\u2019t see Jane anymore due to the breakup (doesn\u2019t sound like she wants to maintain any ties to your family either); it doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s exempt from any criticism for what he did. He\u2019s utterly wrong in this situation and as his sister you\u2019d be doing him a disservice if you just go along with his pity party.", "NTA\n\nYou were much nicer to your brother than he deserved. He may have ruined that poor girl's life because he is a selfish liar. Treating him like anything he did was acceptable could even reflect poorly on you in the future. He deserves to be punished by your family for doing something so disgraceful.", "Nta", "NTA. Just because you are family doesn\u2019t mean you have to \u201cside\u201d with him (sounds like you weren\u2019t taking any sides). Him getting so defensive tells that he knows he made her waste her time with false promises.", "NTA your brother however is the AH he strung her along ignoring her wants because he was comfy with the life they had and its understandable she became angry and bitter towards others.", "NTA: and your brother is a big jerk, she\u2019s 32 now. Imagine starting relationship all over at this age, and then waiting to get pregnant in that relationship. He wasted her time plain and simple.", "NTA. He wasted years of her life and possibly her fertility window to trick her into staying with him. \n\nYour brother makes my skin crawl.", "NTA. I wonder what else he was lying to her about.", "NTA. You were honestly nicer than I would have been, as I\u2019d be explicitly Team Jane here. What he did to her was absolutely terrible and he needs to hear that.", "NTA\nThe truth hurts", "Men who string women along like throughout their most fertile years are unconscionable arseholes. \n\nThe thing about your husband was a bit weird though. \n\nNTA but your brother is", "Right? He is not the victim here. He isn't wrong for his preference but he is a total manipulative, lying AH for stringing her along like that. Glad she dumped his ass.", "My ex-husband did the same thing, one of many reasons I fell out of love with him. 9 years wasted, and although I'm glad I didn't have a kid with him now, still empathise with Jane. Agree, NTA.\n\nWould like to note that I didn't start flirting with my sister's partner cos he got her pregnant, that is odd behaviour.", "Brother lied to Jane, over and over again for a decade. He is not owning his behavior at all. Not surprising he lashes out when held accountable for his own choices.", "He wasn't wasting HIS life, he was obviously getting something out of the relationship, even though he knew he was lying to her.", "She was flirty to OPs husband though. OP could even see that", "I mean I know it's a typo, but I do like thinking of this guy as the mayor of assholes!", "I wish I could upvote you 1000 times", "Yeah, ESH except for OP.", "Actually, her treatment of OP was pretty inexcusable regardless of her circumstances.", "There are not enough comments acknowledging what an AH Jane was too.", "Had mine at 39!", "If one person wants kids and the other doesn't, they're fundamentally incompatible.", "There's nothing wrong with that as long as no one tries to force that narrative onto everyone else.", "Huh? She\u2019s 32, not 50. She has time to have kids. \n\nBtw I still think bro is a huge AH and wasted her time.", "I absolutely don\u2019t disagree with you but I do also want to offer hope. There is definitely a doom and gloom discouraging narrative when it comes to women over 30 trying to find relationships and have kids, and it doesn\u2019t have to be. There are great people out there, and in a lot of cases, plenty of childbearing years left. Plus these days there are more ways to add a child to your life than ever before, be it single or in a partnership.", "I mean she still has a solid 13 or so years of baby making. Women are having babies later and later. I\u2019m 37 pregnant with my first and my best friend is 42 pregnant with her second. \n\nHe\u2019s absolutely the asshole for leading her on and wasting her time, but she still has time to find the right person.", "Maybe what attracted Jane mostly about OP's husband was that he is provenly \"father material\".", "Thanks!\n\nFeel free to join us over at r/stoprape, too.", "I didn't say it was excusable. I said she resented everyone and was projecting, and that is why it made sense when you look back at her actions. It was unexcusable and ridiculous, yes, and it is good she broke up because she would never be able to repair the relationships after so long.", "Nice", "Right.  Like the whole point I was trying to make is, he clearly wasn't in the right state of mind to really hear what OP was saying.  Because he was drunk and also emotional. I never said she was wrong for saying it, I agree with her.  I just thought her timing was off, that's all \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I can't stand men who waste women's time like that.", "True. Exactly why it so critical he told her earlier.", "It truly is THE irreconcilable difference. OP\u2019s brother is such a monumental AH for wasting her time like that.", "She does, but she has 8ish years to have kids before the time most women have difficulty getting/staying pregnant. That's not a lot of time to find someone you love enough to have children with. Especially if she wants more than 1. He wasted the time she could have spent trying to find someone compatible.", "Look, whether people want to acknowledge it or not, 30 is typically the beginning of the downhill curve for women\u2019s fertility. If you\u2019re single at 32 and you want to have kids naturally, you **don\u2019t** have a ton of time left, especially if marriage is an important first step for you.  \n\nLet\u2019s say she takes ~6 months to get over her decade long relationship and another ~6 months to find someone she likes. Add 1-2 years of committed dating while praying that it works out. That puts her around 35. While some people can get pregnant naturally after their mid-30s (I\u2019m personally the product of an older pregnancy), it statistically becomes much harder to do so with each passing year. I don\u2019t want kids but I think it\u2019s evil for people to knowingly waste a woman\u2019s time like OP\u2019s brother did.", "Technically getting pregnant age 35 or later classifies you as \"advanced maternal age\" (formerly \"geriatric pregnancy\"). The risks to mother and baby start going up at that age.", "I went thru menopause at 38 with no warning. Not everyone has a long span to have kids", "Good for you but you don\u2019t know how many childbearing years another woman has, if any. Many women begin perimenopause in their early 30s and fertility decreases substantially when before that.", ">I\u2019m 37 pregnant with my first and my best friend is 42 pregnant with her second.\n\nThis is when the 1st vs 2nd pregnancy matter. Your best friend is pregnant at 42 and, hopefully, everything is going ok with her. But if she hadn't have her first child by 40 and started trying to have one, things would potentially be very complicated for her.\n\nHey, a good friend of mine got pregnant at 45. The difference? It was her 4th.", "As a general rule, yes, but for a woman who wants to have children, it's a whole different ball game. For such a woman, her 20s are, indisputably, the \"golden years\" for the likelihood of conceiving without (very expensive) medical intervention and the lower likelihood of complications (whether maternal or fetal) and genetic anomalies. And since *this* woman wanted children, he wasted those years for her.", "For women that WANT children, those ARE her golden years. By 35, you only have like 10% of your eggs left. \n\nWe don't know how old Jane is, but unless she was a barely legal 18 when they met, her prime baby years are basically over. If she was around brothers age, she is 32-34 now. The odds of finding someone else, getting married and having kids are lower because women DO have a clock on this stuff. Trust me, I am 36 with no kids. I hear it loud and clear.", "Agreed.", "Agreed, he wasted her time and that isn\u2019t okay at all.", "I think it\u2019s wrong to assume that her brother knew the entire time they were together that they\u2019d never get married/have kids together. But I agree that he should have made more effort to figure it out sooner.", "I did a fertility test for shits and giggles at 38 and my levels were so low, even for a 38 yr old, that I had to take it 3 times in case of error. No error. I had basically 0 eggs left. For me, cool beans, I hadn\u2019t had kids earlier for a reason, but I actually got the results in my honeymoon and was like, well that could have REALLY sucked if I wanted a different answer. If figured 38 would have been hard, but I didn\u2019t think it would have been impossible without buying eggs.", "With modern medicine, the 30s can be just as golden, and the parents are usually more financially established at that point.", "If she has a condition like PCOS, then any age after 30 makes fertility difficult. Take this from someone who knows.", "Fertility declines begining mid-30s. You don't have an even chance of getting pregnant, then BAM, Menopause at 50. It doesn't work that way.", "NTA. the older you are when you have your first pregnancy, the more likely you will have complications. After 35 the pelvic bones are not flexible anymore, making a c-section highly likely. Your hormones are dropping so it could take longer to get pregnant. Gestational diabetes and high blood pressure is more likely and these conditions can become chronic.  Its more likely you'll have to give birth before the due date to avoid complications.\n\nThe risk for the baby also rises after 35. You only have so many eggs, and the quality and quantity decreases substantially. Chromosomal and other birth defects are far more likely, As is premature birth, miscarriage and stillbirth.\n\nSo he did waste her best childbearing years and decreased her chance of having a child and of that child being healthy. He's a total asshole for not being honest with her from the start and stringing her along for over a decade.\n\nEarly onset menopause is also on the increase.", "I'm aware that she us. Losing a decade at any time sucks, and I'd argue early 30s is just as bounce-backable. \n\nAny age is a great time to leave a shite relationship", ">that the child won't be healthy or will have problems. Also, the women who will bear that embryo will also take health risk from that.\n\nExactly. So men don't see it as running out of time because they won't be affected by it. So long as they have a child, no problem for them.", "Thank you for pointing this out. I'm really sick of this FAKE narrative that men have all the time in the world to reproduce", "Modern medicine is fucking expensive. $40-$50k up front with no guarantee of a baby isn\u2019t realistic for most people.", "And it can also be a lot harder to get pregnant, and more risky. I know someone who got pregnant later and no joke, delivery almost killed her. IVF is expensive, and you have fewer eggs the older you get. \n\nBut to tell someone who has known from a young age and always wanted kids, who wasted 10 years with a man who did not want them and lied, that everything is fine, is a lie. She might not have kids as a result. Or maybe she wants a big family and now only gets 1. \n\nBottom line, he wasted 10 years of get life and may have cost her her dream.", "You may be more financially established as you get older, but fertility treatments are incredibly expensive. In my area, a single round of egg retrieval can cost up to 20 grand, with no guarantee of a single viable egg (and many insurance plans don\u2019t cover it).  I found out I had fertility problems in my early 30s, and I really wish people had been more honest about the actual timelines when I was younger.", "It's tough. Modern medicine can't replicate the vigour of youth. Fertility rates drop after 30, and rates of complications for mother and baby rise. IVF can be super costly, and isn't guaranteed. It's also emotionally really hard on people who are struggling and want a baby so badly", "As someone who is ttc, this is just simply untrue. You can have kids in your thirties. But for most women, especially after 35, that is only possible if you have a lot of money to throw towards IVF and even then the hormones you have to inject into your body are hell to go through and you may not even end up with a child afterwards. \nSociety has moved towards families starting later in life but biology hasn't changed. Many women in the ttc community feel lied to because they were told by society that 1) birth control has no long term side effects, false. Many women find that their cycles take a year to return to normal if they ever do regulate. 2) they can wait until their mid thirties to start trying, they can, and some have success, but many do not. And they feel they have wasted years waiting under a false impression. \nThis doesn't even touch on the likelihood of pregnancy loss. Which feels so much more painful when you know you're running out of time and healthy eggs.", "Do you want to go to your kids graduation when you're over 60? Do you want to be too tired to play with your kids as they're growing up because you didn't have them until you were middle-aged? There's more to having kids than just money! Youth and energy are pretty important when you're chasing around kids.", "Woman with PCOS here! I can confirm that with PCOS, it is extremely difficult. I've not had a normal period cycle since I was 19. It's been 3 years since I've had a period at all. It really sucks.", "Yes but she wants marriage and kids. Which is much safer and better done in her 20s to early 30s. Since that is what she wants he screwed her majorly", "Well, they do typically have significantly more time than women/AFAB. It is a privilege and one that some men abuse.", "I mean it\u2019s mostly true. Fertility, sperm quality and count is lower obviously, and the kid has a good chance of being born disabled, but for the most part men do have a huge window a time here.", "People tend to think IVF guarantees you a baby until they go through it.\n\nIt's expensive and there's zero guarantees that it will even work.", "Yes to all of this but just to drive the point home at 35 pregnancy is referred to as \"geriatric pregnancy.\"", "It does suck. I do get periods but they are incredibly painful and heavy to the point that I use incontinence pads and codeine and nothing helps. My ex did a similar thing to OP's brother by stringing me along and I ended the relationship as a result. If men know their women have PCOS and want babies... they need to make a decision quickly before wasting our time.", "IVF has such a low chance of success that it feels like a scam.", "They're using 'advanced maternal age' now.", "That\u2019s a super outdated term. If your doctor/practice uses it walk away and find a more up to date one. I just had a baby a few months ago (at 43) and when I made a joke about the term my amazing and usually light hearted OB was like \u201cabsolutely no one here or in any decent practice is going to use that term, medicine has moved past that kind of thinking. If anyone in a medical capacity uses that term or says your age makes this a high risk pregnancy leave the room, or ask them to leave the room and call me.\u201d", "Okay then \"advanced maternal age\" kicks in at 35.  Honestly, though, this is exactly the sort of thing all of these comments are speaking to - there are hard truths about fertility that get glossed over many times that give some women a rosier than honest viewpoint regarding fertility generally and their own in specific.  Terms like geriatric pregnancy or advanced maternal age reflect the real truth that at 35 pregnancy is notably higher risk than it was previously even if they are ugly terms that no one wants to hear.  Feelings shouldn't trump facts", "Feelings shouldn\u2019t trump facts, but adding stress to an already fraught process isn\u2019t helpful either. We can determine so much more with a simple blood test now than a decade or two ago. It makes sense to update our terminology and thinking to reflect that."]}
