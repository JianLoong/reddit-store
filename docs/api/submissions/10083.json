It's a long commute, about an hour, so I had my earbuds in and was playing my Switch. I'm sitting in the window seat, just behind the front section of the bus.\n\nFairly late into the commute, an elderly woman comes on the bus. The guy sitting next to me, in the aisle seat, announces that this woman needs a seat, and someone should give up their seat for her. Before giving anyone a chance to respond, he starts shouting, berating people for wearing headphones and using screens, ignoring those in need.\n\nAt this point, I just say to him, \"feel free to give up your own seat, dude.\"\n\nThen he starts yelling at me, telling me that I'm gonna go blind from staring at a screen, and that the earbuds are gonna give me a brain aneurysm. I wanted to say, 'at least I have a brain,' but I decided not to go that route, I knew it was not the right approach.\n\nThen he gets up, and says, \"there, you happy?\"\n\nTo which I replied, \"I am happy, I don't have to sit next to an asshole.\"\n\nThen he goes on a rant about how people are isolating themselves, and how we should be more united. I get where he's coming from, but his approach is all wrong. I tell him that it's hard to be united when people are yelling at strangers in public.\n\nThis guy then sits down in one of the seats in the front, where someone else got up after this guy was shouting at them. I can hear him chatting with someone, trying to sound friendly, but he's talking about how everyone here seems so depressed.\n\nI pipe up again, saying that it's no wonder people are so depressed, when being screamed at just for existing. He turns to me and shouts, \"I'm not talking to you!\" This is the point where I think that maybe I'm being the asshole, since I kept egging this guy on. I'm not normally like this, I usually keep to myself and avoid conflict.\n\nAt the end of the ride, I apologized to the driver for how heated things got.\n\nSo, what do you guys think? Am I the asshole for trying to put this loudmouth in his place? Or should I have just kept my mouth shut and left it alone?", "created_utc": 1676494676, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1138cj3/aita_for_telling_a_guy_on_the_bus_to_give_up_his/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could've had invisible disabilities and needed a seat, and felt his only way to help others would be to ask on their behalf. Also, once he had moved away from your section of the bus, there was no need to continue to antagonise him. At that point, it was none of your business.\n\nHim, because of his inappropriate behaviour on the bus and making others feel uncomfortable and potentially unsafe.

He has no right to harass others who are going about their days.\n\nJust a word of caution- people who behave like him may have severe mental health issues or be on drugs and may potentially be dangerous (and could be carrying a weapon). As tempting as it is to put him in his place, yours and other passengers' safety is paramount so in future just ignore this type of behaviour and keep your head down.", "YTA.
