Everyone tells me they recover in 2-3 days, but I get sick for 2-3 months. I feel like I cannot breathe whenever I get sick and start wheezing.

She suddenly facetimed me and then hung up after I answered. She messaged me \"it looks like a little cold. Suck it up, get over it and come to my wedding lol\". We argued back and forth where I said that I think it's better if I rest in bed but she thought it was impolite of me to miss her big day esp when her wedding costs $200/person so thousands of dollars.\n\nIn the end, she said it's up to me whether I decide on being a good friend or not and if I don't go, I can just paypal her wedding gift to her.\n\nI feel bad for missing her wedding and upsetting her before her big day but I also will feel miserable if I attended and would need to bring a tissue box because (tmi) I would be coughing up a lot of mucus. AITA?\n\nEdit: After reading some comments, it may not be a cold after all. I  thought it was because it happens during cold/flu season and I basically get all the symptoms (but a worse version). It could be some kind of pneumonia I'm getting every year? It's been like this since I was a kid and I honestly thought everyone's cold was like this until a few years ago because everyone told me I was being immature/a baby.\n\nEdit 2: In the past, I have gone to walk in clinics when I couldn't see my family doctor and they prescribed more or less the same things and called it a cold so that's also why I didn't really question it.\n\nEdit 3: the wedding is going on right now and some friends texted me asking where I am.

I never used to but its been that way for the past three years. No idea why. But my immune system seems to have taken a huge dip in that time. I wouldnt go to it either like that.

Everyone respected this. I had 150 guests. My rabbi said that my wedding was the only wedding he attended that entire year (out of like 30-40) where not a single person caught covid or any other contagious condition (cold, flu, etc). \n\nYou did the right thing, for both yourself and others.

Before the  bachelorette weekend where we'd all be in close quarters, another bridesmaid was saying that she was feeling ill and the bride kept insisting she come and \"just wear a mask\". I pointed out that even if it wasn't COVID, I stay sick from colds for almost two weeks and didn't want to catch anything and I was constantly disregarded. Turns out it was COVID after I bluntly told her to get a test. I wouldn't have gone if sick bridesmaid joined. I don't care the event, if you are sick or under the weather, DO NOT FUCKING GO. I don't know who had COVID at their wedding the next month, but me and the best man caught it there. Bet they had the bride attitude of \"can't miss this event, don't care if I'm sick!!\"", "Even if it is \"just a cold\", it is likely to make others sick.

A simple cold for people like us can be fatal, and some of the other guests at the wedding could also have poor immune systems. \n\nIf you go to this wedding, every single person sitting at your table will hate you. Chances are good that each one of them will get sick. \n\nTell the bride that you are being a good friend and staying home. \n\nI would probably not paypal a gift to her. The pettiness in me thinks it would be fun to show up for the ceremony and congratulate her with a great big hug and a kiss for both her and the groom, Time would tell if she still thinks you are a bad friend for staying home. LOL", "NTA but it sounds like bronchitis or pneumonia. I got bronchitis every year as a kid so I\u2019m prone to it. Now if I start coughing up anything that is not clear I go straight to urgent care. My body just doesn\u2019t fight off the infection quickly once it settles in my chest. \n\nIt could also be COVID. Next time get tested and find out. The medicine for COVID made my COVID stay at just a bad cold level.

Seriously, I have been sick for 6 weeks. Not covid but X-rays revealed long term damage to my lungs probably due to whooping cough some years back.  Good on you for not going.

I have multiple serious health issues and I am immunocompromised. I've actually cut people out of my life for not telling me if they had a cold, and still going ahead to meet me. I would still do the same to friends if they did that to other people, even healthy people, because it's about the principle and a healthy friend could easily be caring for a sick family member.\n\nBottom line is- regardless of the event... nobody should expose others to their contagions. It's assault.", "I'm not sure what else to call it because it usually happens during the cold/flu season and I always have all the symptoms of a cold along with my other symptoms: runny/stuffy nose, headache, body aches, post-nasal drip coughing.", "That's what I thought because I get worried about being infected when I'm sick but no one around me seems to really care about getting sick? They usually get upset over the fact that I got myself sick instead when there are plans.", "I can try asking my doctor about that. But getting sick like this is normal for me and happens around once a year (sometimes more). My doctor usually gives me antibiotics but it still ends up lasting months.", "I mean my doctor always prescribes me a bunch of medicine when it happens so I guess that's keeping me alive?", "I really don\u2019t think OP sucks. I have graves disease and hyperthyroid. What seems like a \u201ccold\u201d to others can be deadly to me. I got a common virus over Christmas and it nearly ended me. Everyone can react differently to illness, and no party is worth risking your health. \n\nThe friend isn\u2019t a doctor. Looking at someone isn\u2019t enough to decide if they are fine or not. especially not over FaceTime. What sort of friend puts their happiness over their friends health? If my friend got sick the week of my wedding, I would totally understand. she should think about the consequences of a sick person, especially post pandemic, attending her wedding. She could get the bride or groom sick before their honeymoon, or potentially endanger older guests. It\u2019s not worth it. Sick people should stay home.", "Am I immature for wanting to stay home when I'm sick instead of going out with people? To me it never feels like a little cold and I always feel like I cannot breathe. It's like someone is stomping on my lungs and I just want to stay in bed and sleep because at least I don't feel pain when asleep.", "I have, my family doctor prescribes me medicine whenever it happens but he never outright said what it was? In the past I've gone to walk-in clinics when I couldn't see my family doctor and they called it a cold so I always thought I just had a bad case of a cold?", "Everyone\u2019s health, no less!", "I've had people not tell me they had a cold before meeting me too and I always ended up getting infected and ending up where I am now. It upsets me a lot because I try my best to avoid getting sick. I try to warn people ahead of time and stay home because that's how I want to be treated but they always prefer that I go out. I'm glad they like me enough to see me but I would prefer to recover at home.", "OP, have you gotten tested for Pneumonia?? That sounds like pneumonia or Covid but I\u2019ve assumed you got tested for that already \nEspecially since it\u2019s lasted so long.

I'd suggest it.", "You may have asthma that only flares up when you have the cold or flu which makes it 10x worse. You should see a doctor and see if you\u2019re able to get steroids(they open up the bronchial tubes) to make breathing easier so you\u2019re not miserable and coughing up your soul. Either way NTA for not wanting to expose others to your illness thats just common decency. Please see someone about your health though to make sure their isnt an underlying cause to a cold last 2-3 months thats not ok.", "I don't think I've gotten tested for pneumonia before but is pneumonia a reoccurring illness? This happens to me like once or twice every year so I guess it's normal for me (but it doesn't mean I don't suffer a lot every time). I did test myself for covid just in case but it was negative.", ">You should see a doctor and see if you\u2019re able to get steroids(they open up the bronchial tubes)\n\nIs that an inhaler? My doctor prescribes me the blue L shaped inhaler when I get sick (along with antibiotics and 2 cough syrups). It does feel easier to breathe for a bit after using it but then the feeling goes away so I wasn't sure if it was helping.", "I had a late friend who used to get pneumonia every year, religiously.  There\u2019s different types and all that and I think she said hers was \u2018walking pneumonia.\u2019 \nI\u2019m not a doctor but maybe it\u2019s something to ask they check next time it happens?", "If you have one bad case (which it sounds like you had, undiagnosed), it's super easy to get again. If I get even the slightest hint of lung crud, it'll blossom into pneumonia within a week.\n\nBTW, some doctors don't diagnose it because if you get it regularly, you might be missing a key symptom: Fever. I always have to tell doctors that I get asymptomatic pneumonia, and to keep that in mind. These days, I use a clinic that has an X-Ray on-site so they can confirm right away. \n\nGetting the right meds makes a HUGE difference in how fast you recover.", "Sometimes it can be in an inhaler yes I need to know the actual brand to know if it has steroids in it though like Qvar has steroids in it but Proventil doesnt its just albuterol. I get a 7 day course of steroids in pill form and then a seperate albuterol or levibuterol inhaler. The steroids should open you up good after a couple days and you would feel much relief in the breathing department. \n\nI see from your comments your doctor isnt even giving you an actual diagnosis just pumping you with the same meds all the time. You probably need to see an allergy and asthma specialist to get proper test done and proper medicine. You may very well need to take a daily controller inhaler to keep your lungs in order so when you do get sick its not this bad. You really need to seek another medical professional because being sick for 4-6 months out of every year is crazy talk especially without an actual cause.", "You need to have a talk with your doctor about what exactly is going on with your body. You may even want to get a second opinion.\n\nNothing you\u2019ve described sounds like a cold. Doctors rarely prescribe inhalers for colds. Doctors rarely prescribe *medicine* for colds. A cold that repeats that often for that long that needs that amount of medication isn\u2019t a cold. \n\nDoes your doctor call this a cold? Or does he assume you already know it\u2019s something else?\n\nYou are absolutely right to miss the wedding when you will spend it miserable and coughing on others. However, your attitude towards your condition sounds very lackadaisical.", "Oh wow the description is literally how I feel whenever I get sick. I don't think I saw the second part of your message above but I always get prescribed antibiotics when I'm sick so maybe this is it? My doctor never told me what it was because it's been like this since I can remember and at this point we're both just like \"yeah the usual sickness\" and he just does his check up and prescribes me medicine. I'll try asking him the name of it.  \nEdit: sometimes I had to get a second round of antibiotics", "I've always called it a cold or tell my doctor I'm sick and he never corrected me so I didn't really think it was something else. Sorry, I don't mean to be careless about my illness. I just thought I experience colds differently than everyone else because it's always been this way to me.I think I will end up getting a different family doctor because I do find it's hard to communicate with him and I want to know what is happening more clearly.\n\nEdit: Oh I will add I have gone to walk in clinics in the past when I couldn't travel to go to my doctor and they also prescribe me more or less the same things and they called it a cold.", "This also could be asthma. Some people only glare when they get respiratory illnesses. Please talk to a doctor about this. NTA.", "If it is pneumonia, I only had it once and like I said it lasted so long. I could barely keep my eyes open during a hair appointment I was so tired. It was so terrible lol I wouldn\u2019t blame you for not going anywhere.\nHopefully you get a name for mystery illness soon!", "You need to go to a different doctor.", "If you're being prescribed antibiotics, then it's not a cold (or your doctor is being very irresponsible). Colds are viral and are not affected by antibiotics.", "Yta for making such a ruckus when she\u2019s got a lot going on prewedding. If you\u2019re cancelling post-rsvp, you should send gift of your place plus a little (so $220). It\u2019s more polite to send as a card. If you rsvped no this would\u2019ve been avoided. You\u2019re here now so deal with it. You\u2019re not a h for being sick and not going, but you can\u2019t have your plate and mucus too (to the tune of having cake and eating it too)", "NTA. EVERY time I get sick, I\u2019m down the for the count for a full week, with the cough and sniffles lasting one to three weeks after that. But 2-3 months is too much. If you\u2019re not better after 14 days, it\u2019s doctor time. I had a BAAAADDDD cold two ears ago. Wasn\u2019t covid, but I\u2019ve never been sicker in all my life.

If you do see a doctor, let them know about your extended symptoms and ask for pulmonary function tests to assess. Also, if you don't have a job that is shift work (so you work during the day) but you find that you're not sleeping well and wake up between 3-5 am due to difficulty breathing/coughing (or for unknown reasons because there was nothing obvious to wake you), let your doctor know about this symptom - pulmonary function dips between 3-5 am, so waking up from respiratory symptoms is something tracked as a marker of control/efficacy for drugs to treat asthma", "That\u2019s one wedding gift that should be kept by the giver.
