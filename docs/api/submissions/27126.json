Your method seems to be working.  Anna found that she thrives under your style and not her mom's heavy handed approach.  Most kids probably would.", "NTA. You graciously cared for your niece for a month, and treated her exactly like your own children. Homes don't have to be perfectly clean and organized and efficient, just good enough for you and your family. When she gets over being mad, maybe Rose will talk to you about how you manage your household.", "ESH. She didn\u2019t get \u201cI hate you. I wish OP was my mom\u201d by herself.", "NTA- you showed your niece was a healthy, functional family looks like. Of course shes upset having to go back to her mom with strict rules and tons of chores. Sounds like her mom doesn't help with schoolwork at all and instead expects her to help with more housework and things a partner would usually do. Having chores is fine, but clearly she's expecting too much of Anna since it's affecting her ability to keep her grades up. You didn't do anything wrong, your sister is mad that Anna has now had her eyes opened and realized she's not being treated well, when before she probably didn't know anything different and assumed it was normal, so she wasn't complaining to her mom.", "NTA your sil is an abuser. Kids need to focus on school and learning. Not doing chores from morning til night", "NTA, your priorities were different and aligned well with her child. This happens. My family was very focused on competition in a way that was detrimental to me and when I was in environments that didn't, I made those comparisons on my own and realized my family's style was just very different from my own needs. Kids can recognize these things.", "NTA. You didn't undermine her you treated Anna like one of your own. Instead of blaming you, rose should be listening to how you parent as you are clearly doing a much better job.", "NTA. It sounds like you have realistic standards a for your home and children. Their job is to be kids, be cooperative family members, but not servants. \n\nRose\u2019s daughter can know *how* to do all the chores, but it\u2019s not appropriate for her to do them *all* each week. She is a kid. It is taking a toll on Anna\u2019s schoolwork.", "NAH. You treated her like your kids, which is to be expected. And it obviously helped Anna, as it had a positive effect on her. However, your SIL is dealing with a lot, especially as a single parent. Her lashing out isn't fair to you, but I think it's understandable given everything. Perhaps you can offer to meet her for coffee and talk more about this, and see if you can support her more, or find ways she can implement your parenting techniques while still maintaining order in a single-parent household. \nRose needs her support system during this time, and so try not to withdraw, if possible", "NTA", "NTA. It's the price she paid for a month of free childcare.", "Having the same rules for all the children in your house isn\u2019t undermining your sisters parenting. Different houses have different rules. I assume SIL lashed out in insecurity because having to fill the role of mom and dad, housekeeper and breadwinner can\u2019t be easy to anyone. But still NTA! \n\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know you all live close to one another and if you\u2019re open to it, but maybe you can tell your sil and Anna that you\u2019re still willing to help her with her homework at your house. It clearly helped while Anna was at your home and it seems like she liked being at yours. You can frame it to SIL that this is one taks off her plate as a parent and that you\u2019re happy to help because that\u2019s what family is for. But only if you\u2019re open to it obviously!", "Uh. You didn't undermine her parenting, because she didn't give you any specifics on exactly how to parent Rose; in fact, you treated Rose exactly the way you treat your own kids, which is exactly the way it should be. Rose felt at home.    \nNTA", "NTA But also an asshole for thinking using phones is inherently 'goofing off', but reading isn't. You can read goofy useless shit, and you can do goofy useless shit on a phone. 80% of what I do online(which could be done on a phone) is at least as useful as reading, and that's not speculation, I actually love reading too. arguably its better than a lot of reading if its just fiction too but lets not get judgy.\n\nas long as you know what they are doing on the phone they should be allowed. Scrolling on instagram and twitter = essentially useless(unless they have a specific hobby they only can find content there) but if they are doing stuff like watching youtube tutorials for their hobbies, they are actually learning things.", "NTA. You took your niece in for a month. If her mom didn't tell her that other people's families have different rules and expectations, that's on her. Also, sounds like her daughter doesn't get as much support at home, so it's understandable (though not your fault), that your niece likes being in a more stable and child centric environment.", "NAH. You might not expect your kids to pitch in with chores but Rose does. Rose also expects her daughter to have a bedtime. Those are not unreasonable. You're fortunate that you're able to turn your kids loose and they study on their own and put thier own dishes in the dishwasher and put clothes away. That's not the reality for Rose. Maybe Anna would prefer less cleaning and no bedtime but that doesn't mean Rose is wrong for her parenting (as many folks are suggesting). She might be able to adjust somewhat but as a single mother she likely doesn't have as much flexibility as you have. You may not have undermined her parenting, but the difference in expectations is causing her daughter to lash out. You might consider offering her support. You're not an AH, but honestly I don\u2019t think Anna's an ah either.", "NTA how does Rose not see the improvements in Anna\u2019s grade as a good thing and a sign to change?", "NTA\n\nIt's sadly clear that Rose is treating her daughter like a partner instead of her child. Because her reliance of the child to help with all chores equally as if they were equals instead of helping her child and letting her focus on school is sad.", "NTA. Her daughter\u2019s school results should come first.", "NTA", "NTA sounds like you didn't really outwardly do anything to make her daughter hate her. I do get where she's coming from that she doesn't have a partner so she can't keep a clean house or whatever. But it sounds like she's expecting her daughter to take the place of a partner and help her keep the house up and so on. Not that I don't think kids should have chores, they should. But not to the extent of an adult partner. Kids primary focus should be school, and secondary to that should be some chores for structure and learning life skills. Sounds like SIL is expecting her daughter to take on enough chores to basically replace a partner and it gets in the way of her schooling.", "> blamed me for putting ideas into her daughter's head\n\nDamn, she sounds like some religious fundamentalist. Her daughter increased performance on school should be a wake up call\n\nNTA", "I have to go with NTA.\n\nShe's putting too much responsibility on your niece and not fostering her education.\n\nOffer to help your sister with guidance on adjusting things on her end to help Anna succeed.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA.  That said I hope you have found it in your heart to show Rose some compassion. Sounds to me like she reacted (albeit poorly) to a situation where she clearly feels inadequate.   Rose is probably doing the best she can.", "NTA, but don\u2019t bash your SIL. she just lost her mother, she\u2019s been away from her child for a month and is clearly struggling. maybe take some time and show your SIL your routine and help her fit certain things into their life.", "nta, it's not your fault that you prioritized her wellbeing and education and your SIL has some fucking nerve yelling at you when you took care of her kid for A MONTH, and that kid clearly flourished in your care in a way she didnt under her mom. \n\nmaybe when things cool down, if your SIL is usually the reasonable type and shes strapped for childcare, *and youre willing to do it,* you could watch your niece a bit more often, to help her keep her grades up?", "NTA it\u2019s not you fault if your SIL is insecure", "NTA, you were asked to take her daughter in. she should therefore have expected her daughter to be treated just as your own kids are.\n\nShe needs to look closer to home for the problem rather than blaming you", "NTA, but definitely sit down with them both, and Rose individually, and mend things. It must have been horrible for Rose to hear that from her daughter after being gone for so long and probably dearly missing her. She likely sacrifices a LOT to provide for her daughter, which can already be a thankless endeavor, and then to hear the worst thing back that could have possibly been said? Ouch is an understatement.\n\nBut what Rose needs to understand, and will hopefully gain clarity on, is that you did something different that helped her daughter in one important area of life. Maybe Rose can approach it with her daughter as an opportunity to make a few changes in their family that will make them both happier. It\u2019s not your fault that Rose\u2019s daughter feels this way. And you did her an amazingly kind service by taking in her daughter for an entire month. \n\nGive Rose some grace as she likely has no emotional support in navigating this. Rose needs to give you a LOT of grace and gratitude because she is just using you as a scapegoat for her pain over her daughter\u2019s comment.\n\nGood luck, you sound like an awesome aunt and mom. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nParents who use kids as free housekeepers suck.  You watched her kid, that was a kind thing to do but to expect anyone to change their own house around to keep rules they don't follow because they are watching your kid is delusional. \n\nHer daughter was going to hate her eventually during the teen years, you just opened her eyes a bit early.", "NTA", "NAH. It sounds like you are an intentional mom who has clear priorities and uses those priorities to provide just the amount of structure your children need. They sound like they are thriving. \n\nIt also sounds like your sister-in-law is rearing a child with thought and effort. She is working, and when she needed to be out of town, she asked a safe person to take care of her. You don\u2019t mention your niece being miserable to have around, so it sounds like your SIL is working hard to rear a good human. She expects the child to do some basic chores, and enforces a set bedtime. She isn\u2019t going to have the summer off to spend more time during life skills during summer break. She\u2019s going to be managing child care without school structure. She knows her child needs to be more independent because there isn\u2019t another adult living at the house. For example, if Rose is sick in bed for a day with a stomach virus, Anna needs to be able to make  herself supper. There isn\u2019t a second adult there to do it. She doesn\u2019t have a spouse/partner, and her main support person (her mother) died 3 years ago. \n\n*Of course* things were a little easier for your niece at your house. There are two functioning adults.  Two adults sharing the paid work and house work responsibilities. Two adults giving the other the piece of mind that they are not solely responsible. Two adults who can tag team to let the other breathe and restore themselves. *Assuming the marriage is a healthy and happy one,* having two adults sharing the physical, relational, and emotional burdens reduces the ambient stress in the house. And it can mean each adult has more bandwidth. \n\nAnna also spent a month with her two cool cousins who know the routine and set positive norms /examples for Anna to follow. It has to be fun to have your children as siblings for a month. And it is easier to follow the expectations when the children around you are. She was probably also less lonely. Also, there was probably a good bit of novelty in living in someone else\u2019s life for a week. \n\nSo many parents wish they could do more for their children. Sometimes they feel limited by money. Sometimes they feel limited by their own emotional capacity. Sometimes they feel limited by the amount of responsibility per adult and wish there  there were two (or four!) adults so that there was more free time in the system. There are benefits (and downsides) to models where generations of a family system live together and share responsibilities and resources. But even then, parents might still wish they could do for their children what other families are able to do for their children. It is human nature. \n\nI think your parenting sounds fantastic. And I could see many reasons why Anna would enjoy being with you all. I think it is wonderful that you parent so intentionally, and that you took Anna in for a month and raised her as your own. What a gift!\n\nI also can see why your Rose might already feel painfully aware of what she wishes she could do if she didn\u2019t have to work so much to support their family, and so seeing *how much* Anna enjoyed it probably really hurts. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t cool that she treated you as she did. Better that she get angry with you than with Anna, but still not cool. I get it, though. It would be tough to be in her shoes. It sounds like Anna would benefit from some conversation about how different family structures allow for the adults to have more bandwidth to relate differently. It isn\u2019t that her mother is mean or a terrible parent. \n\nAND, it might be, that if Rose is able to cool down and process her hurt and disappointment, she can move through to a place where she talks with curiosity with you about the things you did that helped Anna in school. She might find that some things are not possible for her to incorporate given her constraints, but some other things might totally be possible. \n\nWay to go being a great aunt. I hope that you and your SIL are able to find a way through where your gifts and generosity can be an ongoing support to Anna and not experienced as threatening to Rose.", "it is not your nieces job to fill the role of her mother's missing partner. she's the mom, she needs to figure her shit out.

You sound like a great mom.  I hope SIL gets over being mad/jealous and takes some lessons from you.", "Why should the daughter slave away doing household chores? Even if SIL had a partner she likely wouldn\u2019t have help with housework. They are two people, as long as they clean up after themselves this 11 year old girl should have time to do her homework. You are NTA but your SIL is, the audacity to get mad that you not only took her kid in for a whole ass month, but she was happy and thriving in that environment? She\u2019s definitely the asshole.

You did not undermine Rose at all. It\u2019s likely true that Anna needs to help with more chores in her home since Rose is single and works full-time; however, it\u2019s possible that Rose is a bit extreme in her expectations of her 11yo daughter.", "She wants Anna to be her friend and not her daughter.

If that was such an  issue then she should have made alternate arrangements for that  month she was gone.  \n\n I personally don't think having small daily chores is a terrible burden for a child, but the chores should not last hours.  30 minutes a day can get a lot done.  Pick up room, make your bed. Vacuum once a week. Load, run, unload dishwasher.  We did all the time consuming chores on weekends.   At 11 I am surprised she has more to do than keep her room clean and maybe run the dishwasher or vacuum cleaner.  Those are easy tasks that don't take a lot of time.  Sounds like your SIL has high cleanliness standards and maybe needs to look at what is truly appropriate for a child of 11.  Some schools send a lot of homework home and the older Anna gets the more homework she is going to have.  \n\nAs for that perfect house crack, you mentioned your house allows for a little mess so i don't know what she's going on about.
