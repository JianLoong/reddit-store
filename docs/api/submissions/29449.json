My sister (26)  had a birthday trip celebration and didn\u2019t invite me or my other sister(31) but invited our brother(25), his girlfriend (21) and one of our cousins (27) . We (sisters) video chat every other week and she mentioned to us her plans for her birthday but it always sounded like it was only her and her boyfriend going on the trip not with our brother and cousin. This made me feel hurt that she thought of who to invite, thought sisters and then passed on inviting us. On the day of her celebration, she instagrammed that they were all there to celebrate her birthday, I say \u201ctfti\u201d (thanks for the invite) and she commented \u201c come over\u201d\u2026 like I would have if I was invited. \n\nLittle back story, older sister and I don\u2019t really like our brothers girlfriend for many reasons but our younger sister always wants to be around her because she\u2019s young and parties a lot. \n\nLater that night she FaceTimes my sister and I crying that she misses us but also having fun and doing karaoke saying she wished we could have been there but helloooo how can we go when you never even invited us.\n\nAITA for wanting to confront her later today about not inviting us and how messed up I think it was for her to FaceTime us day of showing by how much fun she\u2019s having and saying how she misses us? \n\n\n\ud83d\uded1\ud83d\uded1 UPDATE: I understand that it\u2019s not about me. I\u2019m just hurt at the fact that whenever we FaceTimes it sounded like a couple celebrations with her boyfriend and then to come to find out that it was a group celebration hurt me. There was no reason to hide that it was a group celebration especially when we FaceTime so often. Also, her FaceTiming me showing how much fun she is having and saying how she misses us just rubbed me the wrong way and made me upset.  \n\n\nUPDATE 2: am i really not right to feel the way I feel ? I see she posted a story on Instagram because we follow each other and get side blinded that it was a group celebration with other FAMILY members - not friends. Again , she only mentioned it was her and her boyfriend celebrating. My relationship with my sister is not rocky or anything which is why I\u2019m hurt about this. You all would be okay with it if you were in my shoes? \n\n\nUPDATE 3: my poor choice of words. I don\u2019t mean confront her aggressively, I mean just talk to her and see why it happened that way and why hide it?", "created_utc": 1697979264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dsmkj/aita_for_confronting_my_sister_about_not_inviting/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's from your post alone, but I would hazard a guess that you aren't shy about your dislike for the girlfriend so your sister had to choose who to bring. Given your childish reactions to every comment on your post, we now know why you didn't get invited, because you can't control yourself. \n\nYour sister had likely been drinking when facetiming you, and is expressing that she DID want you there. She isn't rubbing it in, she was a little emotional, likely because she felt she had to choose who in her family could celebrate with her, not a position most of us want to be in. \n\nNow you want to \"confront her\" when you know why you weren't invited. She didn't need to tell you her plans in advance, and her facetiming you is maybe an AH move, but given you had DM'ed her and already started a fight- anyone with family knows your DM was meant to start shit- and she likely would prefer you all to be together if you could act like an adult.", "OP, you should talk it out, calmly", "So...

It was her birthday, you even said brother\u2019s gf likes to party, that\u2019s probably why they were invited instead.

Sorry but your snarky comment on her birthday post was petty. Not everybody gets invited to everything. You give very little details as to how far away the thing was, what the thing was, etc., so maybe she figured you wouldn't be interested. Or maybe her brother invited her for a birthday thing. I don't suppose it matters really, because the point is you decided to make her birthday about you and put a public comment that made it clear you were hurt, ruining her plans.", "YTA.\n\nYou don't like your brother's girlfriend and your sister does.  She decided she'd rather hang out with the brother and girlfriend - because they enjoying partying - during her birthday party.  You were snarky about not being invited, she invited you to spare your feelings, then you refused and came here to complain about her to a big group of strangers.  On top of that, you're now arguing with everyone about how you're not actually the AH.  You're not helping your case any.", "YTA I have a sister just like you. \"People are having fun and they did not invite me, whoa is me\". This celebration is not about you, it is her birthday party. \n\nIt sounds like you have a close relationship with her but not your brother's girlfriend.

Is she not allowed to have fun that does not center around you?", "YTA if you confront her or even start a conversation about this.

DM after seeing her instagram post pointing out that you weren't invited and then planning to confront her about this. Just don't do it!\n\n  \nHave a friend with sisters like this. Ask yourself if you want a sibling relationship like this. Having a mother/daughter getaway? Sisters will want to be invited. Going on vacation with a different relative? Can't post pictures because a sister's feelings will be hurt because she didn't get to go.  Sister with a bucket list trip? Can't go because have to wait for other sisters to retire so they don't feel left out, but then it's too late the bucket list sister passed away. \n\n  \nMy advice is to delete this post and tell your sister you are glad she had a great birthday. No good will come from a confrontation when she did nothing wrong.", "ESH Drop your passive aggressiveness. Don't say anything and accept that you were not wanted at this event. Be honest with how you feel instead, and communicate it after her birthday.

Perhaps after some fun partying and some drinking she was feeling a little emotional and wanted to reach out to her sisters \n\nThere is definitely a breakdown of communication here between all parties. Your sister absolutely could have spoken with you about this beforehand and expressed why you were not invited. But I think you are being way too aggressive and bitter with your sister here. Maybe just take a few days to cool down, give this ordeal some thought and processing, think about where your sister was coming from and why she may have done as she did, and then schedule a call or FaceTime to talk it out and listen to what she has to say.", "Thats why I said I dont know now. She was excluded from the trip then was called during trip and the sister was then caught of guard at the situation.  Put off as she wasn't invited after knowing about it.  All along not basically stating why the fuck aren't I invited.  In which the response would be not everything is about you. Checkmate .", "Rubs the wrong way because you are a very self centered ahole.  Other people's lives do not revolve around you.  Even after all the comments you just don't understand that. Grow up.", "Agreed.  I would be also to tell you the truth as it seems that she didn't inform you of the plans and reason why you didn't get invited unless I missed that. Since you do have a talking relationship I think you may need to ask. Probably come to find out your sister didn't invite you thinking you had something else to do.  Idk.idk.idk.", "Is there a big age gap between everyone? I noticed you didn't put ages in the post, are you a minor and they are.21 plus?", "They can invite who they want. Why would it hurt?  They are allowed to do things together that doesn\u2019t include you and the other sister.  People have different interests, etc\u2026. And quite frankly you sound exhausting and seem to have a huge case of FOMO.\n\nPlus if the older sister doesn\u2019t like the girlfriend, then why in the hell would they invite her?  If older sister was not invited and you were, then what would you do?  Would you stay with your sister or leave her alone?", "Sometimes family can also be friends. It sounds like she may be friends with the brother and girlfriend and you just have a sister relationship with them, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Let the young people party.", "So that's a yes.", "It goes way back but basically she\u2019s one of those girls who think everything is about her and talks down on people who aren\u2019t equipped to her lifestyle like traveling and partying. Lately I haven\u2019t been liking her because she acts like everything she has and all the traveling she\u2019s done is because of her and her part time job when my brother is working 6 days out of the week to keep up with her princess lifestyle.\n\nI have made it known to family that I don\u2019t like her but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m hostile with her at parties or get togethers. I say hi bye and that\u2019s it.", "She didn\u2019t send an invite. Like I said, we do weekly FaceTimes and she mentioned she was going with her boyfriend but never said it was a group thing. Found out though her posts that it was a group celebration . Just annoyed at the fact that she didn\u2019t invite me and later FaceTimes me having fun and crying how she wished I was there.", "Whenever she would talk about it she would say her and her boyfriend are planning xyz  . Obviously I\u2019m responding in a way because I\u2019m hurt but I\u2019ve never or would ever make her party not enjoyable when it\u2019s celebrating her", "It was a lot of hours after and it\u2019s not like I told her to FaceTime me.", "I know but if it comes up, should I not express how it made me feel?", "My thing is, why FaceTime the person you didn\u2019t invite while you are having fun and say you miss them when you didn\u2019t invite them in the first place. It\u2019s rubbing it in at that point", "I understand that it\u2019s not about me. I\u2019m just hurt at the fact that whenever we FaceTimes it sounded like a couple celebrations with her boyfriend and then to come to find out that it was a group celebration hurt me. There was no reason to hide that it was a group celebration especially when we FaceTime so often. Also, her FaceTiming me showing how much fun she is having and saying how she misses us just rubbed me the wrong way and made me upset.", "She did let us know of her plans during our FaceTime catch ups but always mentioned her boyfriend going so we thought it was a couple celebration big group with brother and cousin with theiR SOs", "Seems likely.", "Updated post", "Worse, OP is the oldest one in the group and the rest are in their 20s.\n\nOP doesn\u2019t get along with the girlfriend and she and the other 30+ sister have been hostile to her in the past.\n\nSo it sounds like sis rightfully thought, \u201cWho am I going to have fun with  on my birthday?\u201d and invited them.\n\nPetty Mayonaise called her out with a \u201cTFTI\u201d while stalking insta, and can\u2019t possibly fathom that this kind of shit is why she wasn\u2019t invited in the first place.", "Yea. I just think I have FOMO and feel upset that my siblings don\u2019t want to include me. They\u2019ve always seen me as their \u201csecond mom\u201d because of how our dynamic was growing up and now I feel like they will never see me as a sister and only their \u201csecond mom\u201d who can not have fun around with.", "That\u2019s a no", "\u201cShe\u2019s one of those people who think everything is about her\u2026\u201d the irony is thick here. \ud83e\udd23", "If the best behavior you could\u2019ve mustered was \u201cnot hostile\u201d then I understand why she chose the brother and girlfriend over you. How do you not get that?", "Probably cause you messaged her about not inviting her. She felt guilty", "Again, guilted her into it.", "I get it x", "If she has invited you, would you have had fun? At a karaoke with your brother's girlfriend you hate so much? You would have genuinely contributed to the party instead of souring the mood?", "It is a YOU issue, it\u2019s it what YOU thought, what YOU inferred from conversations, and what YOU feel.  The reality is probably somewhere in between. It seems like you are blowing all of this out of proportion. If you take offense at the smallest perceived slight, people are going to distance themselves from you.  \n\nPlus YTA, because you say \u201cyou understand that it\u2019s not all about me\u201d. No, you don\u2019t understand, you are totally making this all about you.", "Hmmmm. I might get a little \"tight\" with a few wines and ask bluntly.  You may not like the answer but it may solve a thing or 2. I'm sure you are confused as I am.", "Updated post", "Where does it say I\u2019m hostile with my brothers girlfriend? You guys don\u2019t even know the history .", "Ugh that's just gross, yeah would hate to have an event with friends I enjoy to have someone be hostile the whole time. Guess op has main character syndrome.", "I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so wrong with that? You\u2019re older than they are and they\u2019ll never be able to see you as an equal the way they do each other. It doesn\u2019t mean they love you any less. My partner\u2019s sister is 13 years older than he is. She\u2019s a year older than my stepmom. He is very close to her and loves her dearly but she\u2019s a different generation and they were never kids together. They\u2019re never going to interact the same way he does with someone of his own generation. And they never had a strained relationship, it\u2019s just a product of their age gap. Your siblings being close like that does not mean your relationship with them is less, it\u2019s just different.", "Please get checked out.  You need help.", "RIGHT?! I laughed so loud!", "That\u2019s about our brothers girlfriend, not my sister which I have a good relationship with.", "I\u2019m only saying \u201cnot hostile\u201d because that is what everyone is assuming is going on with my brother girlfriend and us. I say hi and bye and don\u2019t say much to her at family functions because she has also shown she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with us. She\u2019s always been very short when we would try to talk to her so we got the hint and kept our distance .", "Maybe so..", "Yes I would have had fun and not rained on her party because it is celebrating my sister. Also I never said I hate her, that\u2019s a strong word. I just tolerate her for the sake of my relationship with my brother. \n\nLike I\u2019ve been saying, it\u2019s not that she invited my brother and his girlfriend and cousins. It\u2019s the fact that she never once mentioned that it was a group celebration. she made it out to be it was a couple getaway with her boyfriend. Now we are cutting a cake for her at our parents later and it\u2019ll come up that she FaceTimed me having fun. I think it\u2019s just messed up to FaceTime someone when they weren\u2019t invited, what\u2019s the point? I obviously wasn\u2019t going to call her out, she was having fun and I was happy for her. Just sucks that she thought she couldn\u2019t have fun with her sisters is all .", "Thank you for the feedback. So do you agree that it was right to not invite someone and later FaceTime them you having fun and say you miss them?", "Not stalking, I have my family on social media so yea I see she posted a story on Instagram because we follow each other and get side blinded that it was a group celebration with other FAMILY members - not friends.", "Yes...we all understood that.\n\nYou, however, still don't get it.", "They meant you.", "So is your sister never allowed to hang out with her and not invite you?", "oh my god GROW UP", "Yep, it has happened to me before when I was a kid and in my 20s.  It\u2019s like when I was a kid I would get a postcard from a friend on a family vacation,  it would always say having a blast wish you were here.  It is just something people say and I was never invited on the trip. This is before social media, FaceTime, cell phones.  But the mentality still remains, at least for me.  \n\nMy brother is on vacation right now and FaceTimed me because he was so excited. A guy who has a very popular history podcast and YouTube channel,  was in the town (think American  Civil War) he was vacationing in.  He interviewed him because my brother goes there several times a year for almost as long as I can remember. . Anyway he said that he was having the time of his life and wished I was there. He has never invited me on his vacation and I wouldn\u2019t dream of inviting or imposing myself on him during his vacation.  We are really close too.  Instead I was so happy for him and ask questions and listened to him, glad that he was having fun and was relaxed.", "She was probably tipsy, due to the horrible influence of the partying girlfriend you and your other sister dislike so much. She'd reached the I Luv You Man stage of cocktails.\n\nUntil you learn how to better hide your contempt for the girlfriend, you'll continue to not be included in events your sister holds when she wants to have fun.\n\nInstead of making her birthday party all about you, examine your behavior to see what you have done that contributed to your sister not wanting you at her birthday party.", "So now because I don\u2019t get along with my brothers girlfriend, I can never hang out with my siblings? Same goes vice versa, brothers girlfriend doesn\u2019t like us either, do they exclude her when we go out? No.", "I never once said that.", "Right now I\u2019m upset at the situation. I\u2019ll grow up \nsoon but am I really that wrong to be upset that she FaceTimed me having fun and wishing I was there? Very contradicting and rubbing it in.", "That\u2019s your brother doing his own thing not with other family members", "But you are mad at her for hanging out with them without you. You don\u2019t have to say it, you\u2019re doing it.", "Yes you are wrong. You made a passive aggressive comment on her post which guilted her into calling you and then you were pissy about that too. No wonder she didn\u2019t invite you! You would have ruined her birthday with your \u201call about me\u201d attitude.", "You don't like the person your sister wanted to hang out with so she didn't include you. Then you guilted her into calling you. Now you're finding ways to make yourself out to be the victim. This is absolutely ridiculous. You're 30 years old. Get a hobby. Find something else to do. This is embarrassing behaviour and yes you are wrong. YTA.", "She wasn\u2019t rubbing your face it in,  that is your interpretation because you want to take it personally.", "I think you\u2019re misinterpreting \u201cwish you were here.\u201d You think it means \u201cI wish you were physically here even though I didn\u2019t invite you,\u201d but it really means, \u201cI wish you got along with everyone and weren\u2019t so up your own ass that I could\u2019ve invited you.\u201d", "Talk to your sister AFTER the trip & more importantly AFTER you've calmed down.", "Not the case. I\u2019m made about how it went. Making it seem like it was a couple celebration of just her and her boyfriend when it was a celebration with other family members", "This, ten thousand times over. OP is being ridiculous to not recognize what her sister was communicating. The idea that the FaceTime was \"rubbing it in\" and not a means of extending some love and inclusion despite her sister's beef with her friend is so self-centered."]}
