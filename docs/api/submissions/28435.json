For a daily shower, 5 minutes should be enough.", "Yeah if OP has like a family of 4 or 5 all in the same house (and thats just a typical nuclear family, not even a large one) that gotta be a lot of water. The economy has been tough on a lot of people (worldwide not just USA), so I imagine their mom has a point in that it'll save them some money if OP doesn't shower daily. Showering daily is honestly weird to me. Part of me feels like OP just wanted to brag about the supposed WAP. Invest in an antiperspirant, figure it out.

Bc simply having an organ that let's out a lot of discharge during the day is, normal and is handled by not doubling up on undies, and wearing the right kind of undies. Swamp ass however, requires a shower to fix and can be prevented various ways. Showering daily because of discharge is odd, just switch underwear, but showering daily because of swamp ass makes sense. OP should probably look into other ways of mitigating the butt sweat though, because all that water adds up.
