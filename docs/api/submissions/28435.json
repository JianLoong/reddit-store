I shower once a day. These showers are not excessive, and generally last 10-15 minutes. \n\nThe reasons I shower every day include:\n\n* hygiene, obviously. it's nice to be clean.\n* it's been really hot all summer, so I sweat more\n* the hot water is nice on my muscles (I have a chronic joint pain condition)\n* we are a large family with multiple pets in a very small house, and it's a small respite of actual privacy\n* I honestly have a WAP and showering regularly keeps things from getting excessively swampy\n\nThe reasons my mother offers for her displeasure are:\n\n* No one needs to shower every day, and that every other day is fine\n* That I didn't used to shower every day when I was younger. Which is true, but then I grew up into an adult who sweats more.\n* That I use too many towels and the laundry is excessive. I also do a lot of laundry, but it's the abstract use of extra water/energy to run the machines that she insists bothers her, not the labor of who's loading the washer. I have offered to hang my towels up and re-use them but she won't let me because she claims it \"stinks.\"\n\nShe's gone as far as angrily banning me from showering. \n\nI think the frequency and methods by which one bathes is going to vary widely by person, location, weather, job, and personal sweat profile. There's nothing bad about showering every other day, but I don't think it's weird or excessive to shower every day either! Again, they're like ten minutes. There's no concern about hot water use.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696695091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/172a022/aita_for_showering_every_day/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may want to communicate something to draw a line.. like I\u2019m showering every day.. every single day I can for life.. it\u2019s not changing don\u2019t comment on my hygiene again. People who have to go to work or school typically shower every single day. If you stay home it\u2019s easy to skip a day.. but for everyone else it\u2019s a problem if you don\u2019t shower every day so don\u2019t let your moms poor hygiene or the fact the she doesn\u2019t HAVE TO affect your decisions. Be clean, feel good, it\u2019s none of her business", "NTA and it's very odd that she hasn't noticed that you have passed the age of puberty.  Or resents your having passed the age of puberty.  Or whatever--it's just odd.\n\nGenerally when somebody has a bee in their bonnet about This One Thing, it's not This One Thing.  Is she capable of having a calm discussion with you, as adult to adult (or adult to adult-in-training depending on your age)?  Is she capable of going over the household expenses with you (edit: with actual documentation from employers and vendors how much money comes in and how much goes out)?\n\nOr is it perhaps something else, that you can't mend because it's a matter of her anxiety over getting older or whatever?", "NTA, I'd ask her if she's having trouble laying the water bill.

In that case I'd say she has the right to decide as she is also the one to deal with the financial consequences.\n\nBut apart from that I would say it's pretty normal to shower once a day. I always start my day by  showering in the morning and most people I know also do it that way", "NTA\n\nI'm confused \ud83d\ude15. She says you should only shower every other day but also doesn't want you to resuse your towels because they stink... so if the fresh towels you use after showering every day stink to her shouldn't that be proof that you do indeed need to shower every day...\n..", "What's a WAP?", "NTA.", "NTA.

Every other day is normal too but there's no reason to get in you about your preference.", "NTA\n\nGood hygiene is normal.", "NTA. Showering daily is basic hygiene!

I have been in and out with the same song playing on my stereo.", "NTA\n\nI can tell which people at work don't shower daily. I don't was towels after 1 use either.", "NTA. I often shower twice a day (after exercise), but you could cut down the time for some of them. 5 min. should be enough for a quick shower. \n\nHot showers consume *a lot* of energy, washing towels often adds to that. Washing them after one use if far excessive though. You can make them last longer/\"stink\" less by swiping off water in the shower before drying, and hanging the towel where it dries quickly.", "NTA for wanting to shower every day and grab a clean towel.

You know your body and hygiene best, 10-15 is a good short shower (I had a housemate who was always at least half an hour in there) and it's unlikely to be causing that much more laundry (caveat being how often you change towels)", "NTA. If you are a guy, like my hairy husband, you do get your towel wet, but if hung, it should dry, but not if you fold it over.", "NTA\n\nI have no idea why people think they can lay down the law over basic rights.

Five is totally doable, seven if it\u2019s a hair wash day (I have long hair). \n\nWashing a towel after one use seems excessive too.

My showers last the same length as yours, unless I'm sick, then they go longer.  I use two towels per week just to allow time for them to fully dry between uses (I have pretty long hair so it hold a lot of water despite sceunching as much out as I can).  I also have quite the WAP, so I get that.  Cotton undies are are best friend for that, it allows more air flow.  No, not normally as cute or sexy as the stretchy or silky ones, but you are far less likely to get yeast infections.  Vag health > cute panties.", "Soft NTA.\n\nMy wife showers once every three days on average. I shower once or twice daily. Different people require different hygiene routines.

My partner showers twice a day on work days. Sometimes it might be considered a lot, but he comes home after doing physical work all day.

It's an increasing obsession of theirs but I don't think it's all that related to the problem at hand of me not being allowed to shower.", "On the contrary, I think the two are very related.  \n\nThey are frightened about something they can't name to themselves--typically this is getting old, or realizing that the so-called American Dream has passed them by, or the first signs of dementia, or some other bewildering and scary chronic problem they don't want to think about--and so they are trying to comfort themselves by planning for an identifiable problem even if it doesn't exist, and also lashing out at you because it's easier to bitch at you than it is to sit with their fear.\n\nBasically, if they are so far into their thought- and emotion-tangle that they can scream at you about money problems but they can't talk calmly to you about actual money figures...double up on your job search."]}
