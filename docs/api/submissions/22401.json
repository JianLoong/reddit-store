Not in a censorship way but because it\u2019s one of those words people tend to focus on instead of the situation that motivated its use in the first place.\n\nYour story is a great example, family is focusing more on the word you used than on the very real and concerning situation of your sister leaving 3 small children with someone who isn\u2019t prepared to watch them.  She certainly needs some coaching on making better parenting decisions and possibly needs more experienced family members to step up but that message has been totally overlooked because you used THE WORD.  If/when you\u2019re up to it acknowledge that you may have made a poor word choice in your frustration (as every human on the planet has) but that doesn\u2019t address the real issue at hand which is an unreasonable expectation that you are on hand as free childcare.", "NTA,\n\nShe crossed the line.

The name-calling was probably uncalled for, though, especially if it's such an ugly word in your social context (which is presumably why you went for it).

That said, you are a minor in your parents house, so you are going to have to put up with the kids around until you move out. You need boundaries- asking for notice before the kids are left with you for a start. Making it clear you are not a 24/7 available babysitter and will not do it when you have other plans. Communicate clearly that if you say no and the kids are left anyway, you are willing to call for child abandonment- however, be aware this will not go over well with your parents and start saving to leave if you do go this route. If your sister plans to leave to go to the store when you are planning to, walk out the door first.\n\nThere's also the last resort of just making yourself less available until you can move out- wake up in the morning, make a breakfast, and go enjoy it outside in the park on nice days. Chill in the library. Go for runs and walks. If you have a lock on your door, keep it locked and do not answer when you are studying. Spend more time with friends.

It's selfish and irresponsible", "Both, her for taking advantage despite you being busy with college stuff but you for calling your older sibling terrible words, you could have had a conversation with her about how you felt instead of being disrespectful (I would get chewed out/maybe get my ass beat if i talked to my older sibling like that, even if they deserved it in my culture). I suggest you apologize and tell her that you cant keep babysitting because you have priorities like college to focus on. Also why is everyone so quick to call CPS????? Calm down", "Done! Vote back pls", "I get it. I had to raise my oldest nephew for years while my older sister went out and partied. My dad was out with his girlfriend. One brother didn\u2019t live at home, and the other had his own life, so it was just hoisted on me because I was the one home most often. It sucks. I maybe got $10 once or twice a year for the rare occasion she felt bad making me raise her kid for her almost every day. Sometimes I\u2019m still bitter, even 15 years later, as I wish I had stood up for myself more.\n\nNTA, but please discuss this with your family. You\u2019re past the breaking point so I get why you exploded. Your nerves are understandably shot (3 kids?! Wtf) and no one seems to care because they don\u2019t have to deal with it. \n\nTell them that you are no longer a babysitter, paid or not. Warn them if they try to be sneaky and just dump them on you anyway and leave, you will be forced to report them as abandoned. Just be aware the authorities may treat it as a civil matter. In any case, it sucks, but also maybe make yourself unavailable - tell them you\u2019re leaving, you can\u2019t watch the kids, then leave. In the meantime, save up and see if you can move out.

Now, yes, parents (especially primary parents) deserve breaks but I would never disrupt someone's life to watch my kid.\n\nMaybe I'm bitter because all my family lives back in my home state 13 hours away, and I'm literally alone 95% of the time as my fiance works out of town. \n\nNTA.", "Ok, real talk. I get why you were mad. I would have been furious.My sister would have heard swear words and bitter nanes thT i invented as i was going. But i would never call a woman that. Not even my evil ex-wife.

She didn't respect your boundaries when you told her no, you're not going to watch her kids.  She dumped them on you and took off.  That's totally unfair and wrong.

I think she didn't mind every now and then (she liked kids), but my brother would never provide enough diapers (so she would go buy some with her own money) and the child always had severe diaper rash (because they didn't change the baby frequently enough) and they never paid her. \n\nFamily members are not free babysitters. People need to take car of their own damn children.", "NTA. Your sister, with your parents approval it seems, is taking advantage of you for free babysitting. College is stressful enough, add onto the stress of having kids dumped with you to babysit? No wonder you lashed out. Could you have not called her that? Maybe.

They might even tell them if eh calls again in such a scenario they will charge **HIM** with making a False Report.\n\nParticularly since the sitter in this case is a minor and they would tell him do what his parents/guardian says.", "I understand being pissed and tired though, and sometimes words don't come out the best when we are in that state of mind.", "Except it worked. Everyone is saying to call CPS, when a well-placed flagrant word that won't ruin the kids' life and the parent's life did the trick.

Plus it would be a huge dick move to threaten to separate the kids from their mom over a babysitting dispute.", "Seriously. I'm a therapist and calls like this that are legit often don't result in anything. Comments advocating for for CPS calls for petty disputes are uninformed at best and are encouraging use of law enforcement for petty revenge. So thoughtless. It's also thoughtless and selfish to advocate for exposing the children to law enforcement and legal threats targeting their caregivers, just because you can't manage a personal situation effectively. Pisses me off.", "Seriously!! Child welfare agencies are seriously understaffed.

Every few minutes text a new photo of you farther away from home, do this every single time.
