Tell her next time she leaves them with you that you\u2019ll call and report them as abandoned children", "NTA they arent your kids or your problem. Next time call CPS for child abandonment", "NTA, leaving kids without permission is something you can call the cops over. I'd let her know that's what's gonna happen next time. If she does it, text her and say \"CPS is on the way to get these kids so you better beat them here\" and I bet she never pulls this again.", "NTA. And your parents have thoroughly failed you and failed as parents by taking her side on this. Her kids are her responsibility. Your sister and your parents are seriously willing to throw away your youth and your future so you can take on the consequences of her decisions and mistakes. This is a hill to die on. If you do not put your foot down now, they'll continue to exploit you.\n\nIf this is a dynamic that has gone on for some time now, seriously consider moving out and adjusting contact with your parents and sister once you have the means.", "NTA. Your sister was rude, disrespectful, and deserved to be called out harshly. Not cool at all to just drive off and leave the kids when you already said that you could not babysit.", "NTA. But consider the effect using an incendiary word has on any communication: the issue becomes your vernacular instead of the real issue, that you are being forced to do something you've clearly and repeatedly stated you don't want to do. The real issue gets dismissed and never addressed because *OMG you used THE WORD*!", "NTA\n\nHer kids, her responsibility.", "NTA\n\nCall it how you see it. I absolutely despise how most family assumes they can choose to take on a responsibility like children and then dump them off on people. \n\nYou should start leaving the house as soon as you see her or her kids or think they're gonna try and pull this stunt again.\n\nMy Sister found out my Mother and I had a week off last year and was all like, \"Wanna take the kids for a week?\"\n\nAs soon as she said that I grabbed my Moms phone and told her we would be happy to for $750. She got pissed off and I pointed out we pay for all their needs when they're at the house, she never provides any food or anything and that constant, 24/7 child care for a week would probably cost more if she hired someone.", "NTA\n\nYou got your point across.  \n\nReally TRY to make yourself less available.  Ghost her when she is heading over if you can.\n\nForcing you to babysit is unreasonable.", "NTA for feeling frustrated, you\u2019re a 17 year old kid who is not a parent and isn\u2019t responsible for these children.  However, that particular word is definitely one of the big no-nos (at least in the US) and as a not-your-mom-but-a-mom I\u2019d advise you to remove it from your vocabulary.  Not in a censorship way but because it\u2019s one of those words people tend to focus on instead of the situation that motivated its use in the first place.\n\nYour story is a great example, family is focusing more on the word you used than on the very real and concerning situation of your sister leaving 3 small children with someone who isn\u2019t prepared to watch them.  She certainly needs some coaching on making better parenting decisions and possibly needs more experienced family members to step up but that message has been totally overlooked because you used THE WORD.  If/when you\u2019re up to it acknowledge that you may have made a poor word choice in your frustration (as every human on the planet has) but that doesn\u2019t address the real issue at hand which is an unreasonable expectation that you are on hand as free childcare.", "NTA,\n\nShe crossed the line. Time for c**tmuffin to be a mom.", "NTA. You don\u2019t want to continue to be taken advantage of and forced into providing your sister with childcare services against your will. No one is hearing you calmly express how you feel, so you used words that would finally get their attention. You\u2019re human and want to be heard. Seems like you accomplished that and instead of taking responsibilities for their actions, they\u2019re trying to use the fact you called her the \u201cc word\u201d to twist the narrative and play victim. It\u2019s just a word.", "NTA. She is one for doing that.", "Id say i apologize for calling you that wordmwhen you were trying to take advantage and parentize me and that will be 250 dollars for babysitting ahead of time", "Esh.\n\nI absolutely hate that word and think it is a disgusting thing to call a woman - especially one you supposedly love like your sister.\n\nHowever I agree that it is ridiculous to force you to babysit when you don't want to. Next time just walk out the door.", "ESH, with a caveat\n\nYou were right to be pissed, given that you've had your boundaries pushed on the issue of babysitting, and were completely ignored by everyone when trying to assert them.\n\nTo be honest, you tried being calm and reasonable first, and eventually bursting out is what worked. The name-calling was probably uncalled for, though, especially if it's such an ugly word in your social context (which is presumably why you went for it). I can still understand your murderous rage, though. Understandable, but not justified. You could apologize to your sister, admitting you were out of line and you don't stand by that behavior, while still letting her know you were really angry and it was a big deal to you and that you won't be taken for granted as an always-available babysitter.", "Teach the kids plenty of fun words next time.", "NTA, you called it like you saw it. Your not the parent to her children so therefore you shouldn't have to worry about having the responsibility of parenting her children. Good luck in your studies and I hope you get fair away from being forced into babysitting", "NTA - family sucks but unless you are an Australian then you shouldn't call anyone that.  Apologize and let her know from now on you'll just calmly call CPS next time she abandons her children.", "Apologize, but warn her the next time she does this, you will leave the house and call CPS", "NTA, feed them sugar every time she leaves them with you.", "While i don't condone 5 of that word, it certainly got her attention. Tell her you apologize for using that word and that you will no longer be babysitting for her. When she comes over with the kids, say you need to run an errand and get out for an hour.", "NTA - I'd use this as an opportunity to agree with them. Agree it was absolutely a nuclear word and that's why you chose it so she could finally understand how serious you were. \n\nThank them for appreciating the gravity of your word choice. \n\nOffer to continue making this extreme word choice every time the same scenario occurs moving forward.", "Who cares what you called her? it got results.\n\nNTA.

It sounds like you live rent free, you\u2019re 17 and that makes sense. Helping out the family is part of it. You need to set boundaries with your needs around helping them.

Their friends will love that.", "ESH\n\nThere was zero need for the insults, and you undermined your point by using them. Now your family gets to focus on your word choice vs the actual issue you have, so you didn't help yourself \n\nYour sister is an AH for leaving kids with you when you are telling her not to. That said, you are a minor in your parents house, so you are going to have to put up with the kids around until you move out. You need boundaries- asking for notice before the kids are left with you for a start. Making it clear you are not a 24/7 available babysitter and will not do it when you have other plans. Communicate clearly that if you say no and the kids are left anyway, you are willing to call for child abandonment- however, be aware this will not go over well with your parents and start saving to leave if you do go this route. If your sister plans to leave to go to the store when you are planning to, walk out the door first.\n\nThere's also the last resort of just making yourself less available until you can move out- wake up in the morning, make a breakfast, and go enjoy it outside in the park on nice days. Chill in the library. Go for runs and walks. If you have a lock on your door, keep it locked and do not answer when you are studying. Spend more time with friends. Do not return home if asked to to babysit while you are out. This is the passive aggressive way of dealing with it, but the best way if it gets hostile", "INFO.
