Usually, that is more nonsense, worthless stuff like seeds, though.", "This is a common tactic of unethical Amazon sellers.  They purchase the item under an assumed name and different address and then leave themselves a 5-star review that will show up as \"verified purchaser.\"  This is one reason to take all Amazon reviews with a grain of salt.

Frankly this sounds like the scam where retailers/sellers send random shit out to random addresses and leave ratings for themselves. My friend had the same thing happen to him. Amazon packages all addressed to his address, shit he never ordered and he kept everything (though most of it was random garbage lol).", "How would anyone know where it's supposed to go? you cant be", "YTA.

A couple years back, my husband received a huge toy truck with Elvis all over it.\n\nSometimes you get random shit from Amazon from a strawman account so they can get rid of inventory and bump up their reviews.", "It\u2019s part of a scam for positive reviews. Google it. They\u2019ll stop in time and you can enjoy your free stuff and strawmen can give positive reviews. If you didn\u2019t order it and it came to you, you don\u2019t owe anything to anyone.

But just contact Amazon. Sometimes it's actually because of overseas sellers using your address instead of their own (they could have just used a random address they found online). I saw a couple on Tiktok last year that were sent hundreds of different flags because of this.", "NTA. You can't refuse them & you can't send them back unless you are the original buyer. They will just sit in the hallway or in front of your home. I literally had a package being sent to the wrong address and I reached out to Amazon 10 mins after I bought it and realized it was wrong. They wouldn't allow me to cancel it, wouldn't allow me to change the address and wouldn't allow the driver to return it. So someone at that address either got a free Echo Show or threw it in the trash.", "It seems like you\u2019re not doing anything legally wrong, but I personally think you\u2019re kind of an a-hole because you could have fixed this problem and you haven\u2019t and it\u2019s inconveniencing someone else.", "Because it\u2019s difficult to differentiate; an actual order is going through the system, being shipped to a real person\u2019s house.", "Incorrect, it is as long as they don't have somebody else's name on it.", "No. It's illegal to open mail that is not addressed to you.

However, opening a parcel clearly not intended to be delivered to you (for example if the UPS guy drops off a parcel that is not for your house by mistake, or if it has the correct address but clearly somebody else\u2019s name) then taking the contents would fall under state/local laws regarding theft of property.", "Who exactly do you think would press charges in this situation?", "Did I say it was illegal? No. Is this sub called \u201cr/dididoacrime? Also no. The person I responded to pointed to FTC guidance respecting receiving unsolicited items you / being charged for items you didn\u2019t order and asserted that this guidance means OP is legally entitled to keep the items and this is 100% false - such guidance is irrelevant to this situation.

Take the L", "No\u2026. It\u2019s obviously addressed to whoever the resident is.", "Yta. You haven't spent money on Amazon. You spent money on products from Amazon. And you got what you paid for.

It\u2019s a well known ploy and is on the news frequently.  Keep it, send it back, doesn\u2019t matter.  You might check and see if feedback is being posted under your name, though.", "YTA morally. You know it and your husband knows it. Stop excusing how much you spent on Amazon, its not relevant. All the legal arguments about mail delivery still doesn't expunge the fact that you know these items are not yours and have been purchased by someone else.", "Amazon probably won't care if you keep the packages and you might want to check if you're legally safe to keep the items too. \nBut I agree with the others saying contact Amazon at least just so they *know* about it happening. \n\nI don't think I can really make a judgement. Like NTA if it's indeed scammers as some people here are suggesting might be, because then they are TA. But if it's just weird it's NAH. I doubt Amazon can prevent this.\n\nEdit: in my opinion, you should always contact the seller if you receive a package that you didn't order and isn't picked up by someone. Just to make sure they know about the wrong delivery.", "NTA. You tried your best on trying.", "NTA, but honestly it's just really wasteful if you have no use for the items. Which it doesn't sound like you do.", "This happened to me a few years ago. I was getting random stuff from Amazon. It was really random stuff, prices were never really expensive, ranging from a couple of quid to \u00a315. \n\nI mentioned it on Facebook, and someone told me to check my \u2018hidden\u2019 purchases. They were all in there and I\u2019d been charged for them, I\u2019d just not noticed the charges coming out of my bank as they were so small and for some reason I wasn\u2019t getting the notification or email of sale. I  think it came to about \u00a390. I had stuff still on the way, Amazon told me to refuse it. \n\nTook me ages to sort my Amazon account out and make it secure again and I\u2019m still paranoid. I did get my money back. \n\nSomeone else suggested that sellers send out random shit out to inflate their sales. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019d suggest you check your hidden purchases and your bank to make sure you\u2019re not paying for it all. \n\nNTA cos I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve got any malicious intent. Just be careful you\u2019re not getting conned. It\u2019s funny until it isn\u2019t.", "As I replied to someone here. There\u2019s no way this is real. You\u2019re already TA.

Likely in the end you aren\u2019t taking money from Amazon, but from the company they make replace or refund the item.", "Is the Loft in your building a separate tenancy?", "Anything left at my door is mine. That's an immutable law of my universe.", "NTA. If you return it Amazon's not going to resend it to the right person. For most of those small things,  it's actually cheaper for them to send a replacement, while they ship your return off to a landfill in China somewhere. I would notify them because I don't like the amount of waste all that shipping generates (to you + to the original buyer when they report it) but if that's not an issue to you, then milk it. But for what you already have, a return isn't benefiting anyone worth it.", "Yes, it happened to us as well.  We received a few boxes addressed to our house that we never ordered.  Imagine my surprise when the first box arrived \u2014\u2014 and I kid you not \u2014\u2014 it was a vibrator and a therapeutic wrist guard/ support.  I thought it was a friend playing a gag on us.

Amazon isn\u2019t making this mistake more than twice.", "If it's addressed to him, yeah it's illegal here too", "Omfg who cares if it\u2019s legal.

Good grief.", "Yeah we had a rug delivered to us accidentally. Had the dudes name on it. Spoke to our landlord and he said he would try and get into contact with the old tenant. He did say that he probably won\u2019t reply though since he owed them a ton of money.\n\nWe held on to it for a month. Then called Amazon who told us to just keep it. We probably could have called them way earlier but we didn\u2019t want the guy to randomly show up snd demand his rug that was now on out living room floor.", "so random junk mail, which is not addressed to me, I am such a criminal.", "Only illegal if it's US Mail, everything else is good to go!", "That's a good use for it lol", "You said the person who said it was legal was 100% wrong, so yeah, you said it was illegal. \n\nSo, in your opinion, is it legal or not?\n\nI know this sub is not about legally, but that's what this thread is about.", "You told the person who said it is legal that they are wrong\u2026 that\u2019s the same as saying it\u2019s illegal.
