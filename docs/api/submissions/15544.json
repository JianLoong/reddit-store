I spend enough of my time going down random customer service holes for legitimate reasons, I\u2019m not doing it for someone else. \n\nSeems pretty simple. Order something? Put the right address in. You fucked up? Good luck with Amazon. Amazon fucked up? Suuuuuper don\u2019t care.", "But if it comes from an Amazon driver and not usps then it is not considered mail.  It doesn't fall under that law, if in US.", "LAWYERED! I hope this is true.", "Redditors really do pretend to be helpless, huh? How about the tracking number? Lmao\u2026", "The only thing we get that's adressed to the adress without a name is commercial flyers haha. So it's really nothing that happens here", "\"Google School of Law credentials\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I literally had this happened a month ago. I received an Amazon package with my address but not with my name on it. It was clearly meant for someone but they put the wrong address on it (I\u2019m guessing mixed up the numbers or Street name or forgot to change their address in Amazon before moving). Posted in local groups asking if anyone was missing a package they ordered and waited a few weeks. When I heard nothing, I contacted Amazon to let them know. They took care of it on their end and said I could do whatever I wanted with the package I received.", "Amazon will just tell them to keep it anyway, unless it's something really expensive. I've had this situation happen before.", "But it's only going to the wrong place because whoever ordered it hasn't bothered to correct the address after what has to be several missed packages. It's not on OP to contact Amazon,  who won't care anyway. OP is NTA.", "Ok so I still get packages and letters to my flat but addressed to the old tenant. Are you saying legally I can open and keep them? I\u2019ve been writing \u201cRTS - wrong address\u201d on them and putting them back in the postbox but honestly after 2 years of living here and she still hasn\u2019t changed her address for anything, I\u2019m getting sick of it lol. Cba to go to the postbox every week for someone I\u2019ve never met who seems too lazy to update her details. So can I just keep it legally?", "They could just give them back to the delivery driver.", "Please don't write \"wrong address\" on them. If they come back into the mail stream and a sub is covering when they do, it's just going to throw them off.\n\nIf the address is correct, but the name is not, write \"wrong name\" or \"no longer lives here\".\n\nIf you really want to go above and beyond, just throw out anything that doesn't say \"first class\" or \"service requested\". I'd hazard s guess that most of what you're getting is third class junk mail, and you're just giving that back to the mail carrier to throw out when they get back to the office.\n\nEdit: I just realized you referred to it as a \"flat\", so you're probably not in the US and my advice probably doesn't apply. I'm leaving this up for anyone scrolling by who is in the US and gives their junk mail back to their carrier, though.", "AFAIK it\u2019s only illegal to open mail that is not addressed to you. We\u2019ve started throwing away the old tenants post because it has also been 2 years for us and they no longer even live in the country", "you clearly aren't understanding the logistics of that. the delivery service IS amazon right? the packages have his address and no real name. if he tells amazon not to deliver then how will they distinguish his packages from the fake ones when he DOES order? the driver isnt going to look into what account made the purchase or something, just \"this package goes to this address\". so he can't stop these without stopping all packages to his house, which why would he want to?   \n\n\nit's been THREE weeks and someone hasnt gotten a single package and..they keep coming? obviously this isnt just a case of someone putting the wrong address, there have been instances of people being sent random items that were purchased for fake reviews", "? Amazon has a while section of their site devoted to returned and slightly imperfect items for sale at a discount.", "IF they even are there when the driver delivers, you forget people have lives and jobs  \n\n\nalso if they were given back, the itemw ould end up in a land fill somewhere because amazon would rather toss the item than do a full return and restock", "I actually write \u201cRTS - no longer at this address\u201d\n\nMy thumbs were just achey and I paraphrased instead of typing the full thing out my bad\n\nAlso I live in UK so I don\u2019t think \u201cservice requested\u201d is a thing here as I\u2019ve never seen it on a letter. But I did call the water company for her since she was still getting bills, that\u2019s the only emergency thing I\u2019ve seen. She\u2019s also had a bunch of nhs letters but when I rang the docs they said I couldn\u2019t change her details without being her lol. So that one\u2019s entirely on her.\n\n\nEdit: you\u2019re right I\u2019m not American, although your bigger clue should have been me going to the postbox every week and it being an effort - aren\u2019t American postboxes in your own garden? Haha", "There\u2019s nothing on here that says Amazon is the delivery service. But if it is, that\u2019s easy too. Just take a couple of seconds to fill out the unwanted package form online. That doesn\u2019t stop your orders. None of this is unreasonable.", "I've had this happen and called Amazon, they just told me to keep it.", "Not mine. The US Postal service doesn't deliver to my house. That's how far off the beaten track I live. In order to receive mail, I have to maintain a postal box in the nearest town.", "It depends on the development. Some are right on the house, some have a slot on the front door, some are curbside at the front of the property, some have a row of boxes at the end of the street, and some are centralized units with slots and keys for each apartment or house. \n\nThe USPS is pushing to make all new developments get those centralized units because they can pay city carriers for less time, and they only count as half as much value towards a rural carrier's salary as an individual box would.", "I live in the UK too, lived in this house for 3 years, and we still get DVLA tax letters for the previous owners. We only recently stopped getting doctors letters and still get his voting card. Its ridiculous. We assume his wife did all of that stuff and that's why he hasn't bothered to get it changed. They divorced and she moved out before he did. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">For the past 3 weeks we have been getting ***Amazon*** deliveries to our house\n\n ***an ungodly amount of money with Amazon.***\n\n***t\u2019s on Amazon to realize they\u2019re sending***  \n***So, AITA? I could let Amazon know***", "Was gonna say the same thing - we've had so many deliveries from multiple companies, including Amazon, that were either broken, wrong or not for us, and each and every time, the company has told us to keep it. Cheaper for them to claim on insurance than it is to collect it apparently.", "That sounds like chaos. I\u2019ll take my 5 minute-walk-away postbox over that \ud83d\ude02", "Amazon ships with lots of different carriers, including local delivery services, USPS, UPS, FedEx, DHL, and their contract carriers.\n\nIf you identify a shipment, they can track what the shipment is, what the order number is, what account it was sent from etc.  That is what is on that barcode, which is how they track packages and notify you.\n\nIt is likely someone simply typo-ed their address or it is scam sellers writing reviews.", "Sorry, still not clear who's the one delivering....", "It's usually pretty consistent within any neighborhood. A street, development, or town will be designated for any one of those delivery methods, and that's just what it stays as in perpetuity. We're not walking up to one house's door, driving to their neighbor's front yard for a curbside box, then going to a centralized unit for the next three houses. It'll be pretty uniform on any given area (for the most part, anyway)."]}
