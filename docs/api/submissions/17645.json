Consulting a mental health professional may be in order as breaking out of these deeply-ingrained rituals and obsessions can be extremely difficult and might require medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, if that is indeed the cause.", "Kind of believe this to be bullshit, but if it isn't your husband has issues.

You are not an asshole for telling him to go to the award ceremony, but you should also think about the bigger picture here\u2026 like figuring out why he is so obsessed with this online debate rather then real life  and then getting him some psychological help. That is not healthy behavior\u2026 if he can\u2019t take a few hours out of his day with arguing people on social media to support his son than it sounds like he is addicted and it is negatively effecting his relationships and life.

You\u2019ve already made your stance very clear, no need to nag or drag him to the ceremony kicking and screaming. Let him waste his time however he wants and make his own choices, and eventually your son will really start to see where his father\u2019s priorities lie.", "I'm struggling to understand how someone could spend 14 years in a feud over a Wikipedia article. \n\nBy this logic, he shouldn't have time for work, sleep, or anything else because that dastardly Jimbo Wales can say that unicorns are faster than goblins at any time. \n\nNTA btw", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s more committed to wikipedia than your marriage and your child so I\u2019d honestly not bother with marriage to someone like that anymore", "See here's the thing. \n\nYou can't force him to have different priorities. Yes I agree that it's completely unhealthy and wrong for him to prioritise this internet dispute over his son's award ceremony. However, he clearly doesn't think so. Evidently he isn't going to change his mind, so all you are doing is talking to a brick wall. \n\nYou can't really give him no choice but to go because he's an adult and he can do what he wants with his life. If you want things to change, (which I definitely would) then your best bet is to try and stage an intervention, involving therapy for sure or if that doesn't work/you can't try that option then your only other choice is for you and your son to remove him from your life. \n\nAlso, have you thought logically about forcing him? How far are you willing to force? Are you going to pick him up and shove him in the car on the day of this awards ceremony? Because if not, then like I say, the only way to get past this is for him to get the help he urgently needs and realise that he needs to change his life by himself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9", "I can't believe this is real.
