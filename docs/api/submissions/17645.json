I can\u2019t bring myself to call someone TA when the symptoms of their seemingly undiagnosed/untreated mental health issue are interfering with normal daily functioning unless they are actually refusing to get or comply with mental health care.", "NTA but this is bananas. Does your husband go to work, eat, do chores, hobbies, visit family? Does he do nothing else but have internet fights with people?", "NTA. My father skipped my high school graduation for similar reasons and to this day I have never forgotten that.

I understand it\u2019s important to him but if this has been going on for 14 years (almost as long as your kid has been alive!) then there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019ll ever really be over in the foreseeable future. Where will he be when the kid gets his license? Graduates high school? Et cetera\u2026 the longer he\u2019s allowed to put this first the deeper he\u2019ll get into it and the less he\u2019ll care about even the really major life milestones.\n\nEDIT to add - as someone with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, this sounds like it could be a case. Consulting a mental health professional may be in order as breaking out of these deeply-ingrained rituals and obsessions can be extremely difficult and might require medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, if that is indeed the cause.", "Kind of believe this to be bullshit, but if it isn't your husband has issues. NTA.", "NTA. Congrats to your son! It sounds like your husband has a mental health issue. Hopefully, you can get him the help he needs.", "This can't be a real story. It just can't", "NTA at all. Your husband is putting priority on his ego over your son. And you have every right to put your foot down and put a stop to it.", "YTA for writing this.  Is there a full moon today?  AITA posts are weird in bulk today.", "NTA. Your husband is an addict. He needs to put down the device and come back to reality. W", "Um...\n\nWell you're NTA for sure but OP, I think you have way bigger issues than this awards ceremony. Your husband has been obsessing over an online feud for **14 freaking years**? And he thinks that's a perfectly valid reason for skipping major events in the life of his son?\n\nYou need couple's therapy and some SERIOUS conversations about your husband's hyper-fixation on this, STAT", "NTA- honestly it sounds like your husband needs to talk to a therapist about the level of obsession this has reached since it\u2019s interfering with his real life", "NTA.      \n\n\n\nYou should get divorced.", "Invite Jimbo Wales to the ceremony. Problem solved.", "I don\u2019t believe this is real. How can someone invest so much time in a silly debate with a virtual stranger?\n\n\nBut if it is you and your husband have much bigger issues than an award ceremony. You are not an asshole for telling him to go to the award ceremony, but you should also think about the bigger picture here\u2026 like figuring out why he is so obsessed with this online debate rather then real life  and then getting him some psychological help. That is not healthy behavior\u2026 if he can\u2019t take a few hours out of his day with arguing people on social media to support his son than it sounds like he is addicted and it is negatively effecting his relationships and life. If someone had that type of relationship with alcohol or drugs it would be time for rehab, in his case maybe it is time for tough  love and hard choices - either he seeks help and starts living in the real world with his family or he moves out and you move on.\n\nNo judgment, not saying you should leave", "NTA.\n\nTell him get off the damn computer and get into real life or this whole debate he's dealing with will end up with a debate in court over the divorce he'll be dealing with.", "Your husband has had an ongoing online dispute for 14 yrs but it\u2019s just now become an issue?

He has been enjoying this dispute for 14 years? What a total and utter waste of life.  \n\nWhen he reaches a point that he wants to skip his own son's award to continue an online dispute of 14 years then it's long past time to issue an ultimatum.
