Or the traumatized survivors of their abuse?", "I don't know if it's possible to be a practicing Christian of any type and not be hypocritical.  At the very least you have to accept a seriously high level of cognitive dissonance.  \n\nIt's certainly not possible to be evangelical Christian these days without being severely hypocritical, unless you actively disagree with your church and political views of most of the church membership.  But if that's the case, why would you even identify with the group?", "Lol.\n\nI just imagined a stork getting a text \"new location of delivery *GPS link*\" and doing a U turn.", " \u201cI was kinda surprised how long it took for my dad to notice our suitcases. It was like watching them to have me, but at least we didn\u2019t have to wait 9 months.\u201d\n\nI am confused about what that means? Suitcases for what?", "> The correct response to someone revealing they were traumatized by [\u00d7] should never be, \"but not all of \u00d7 are bad!\"\n\nIt is when they're using their trauma to say, based on literally nothing, that someone they've never met and heard about only in the vaguest terms is dealing with identical trauma.\n\nLiterally, this escalated from \"he asks us to pray for him\" straight to \"he's dealing with abuse from his evil fundie parents.\"", "The correct response to a sweeping application of a biased stereotype is to correct it.\n\nAre you saying I can say all women are abusive, simply because I was physically and sexually abused by a couple of different women?", "But, evangelical Christians are a small subset of a belief system composed of a large number of different denominations.\n\nChristian covers everything from Roman Catholic to Monophysites to Anglicans to Westboro types.\n\nMight was well say it's impossible to be human and not be a hypocrite, bud.", "I was joking about my family\u2019s summer vacation. Our stuff went around the carousel at the airport twice before my dad noticed.", "So literally all the responses to me are just going to be people playing, \"la la la, I can't hear you\" to the millions of victims of religious abuse and religiously endorsed child abuse? OK then.", "Exceptionally poor choice of analogy. \n\nIf our culture had a long history of women being allowed and even encouraged to abuse men, \"for their own good\" (which is absolutely the case with Christians and disobedient/non-Christians. Google \"residential schools\" and \"Magdalen laundries,\" for a taste) then, yes, you would be absolutely justified in commenting something like, \"there is no more cruel abuse like the 'loving correction' of a woman.\" And anyone who ignored the centuries of women viciously beating and killing non-compliant men to say, \"not *all* women!,\" would absolutely be in the wrong.", ">Might was well say it's impossible to be human and not be a hypocrite, bud.\n\nIt's probably not possible.   Even the Buddha was plenty hypocritical.", "So no counterargument to the point that it's not healthy behavior to make assumptions about people and situations you know nothing about based on the most absolutely superficial of similarities.\n\nThat's what I thought.", "No, they wouldn't be wrong, because not all women are abusive.\n\nWhich makes it a perfectly apt analogy.\n\nHistory is full of abusive women, but it also contains women who weren't.\n\nSame with Christianity.", "Le sigh. Some of us have jobs, fam. We can't spend all day hand-holding you into understanding why you should put your energy into listening to victims and educating yourself on the centuries of abuse perpetrated by their abusers, instead of defending said abusers. That's a \"you\" job. \n\nBut since you insist... you know that saying, \"extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\"? \n\nIn a country with millions of people coming forward to talk about the religious, sexual, emotional, physical abuse, abandonment, shunning and familial disruption they've suffered because of religious leaders and their teachings. Which is next door to a country who's spent the last few years grappling with the horror of finding the corpses of more than *TWELVE THOUSAND* abused, raped, neglected-to-death-or-outright-murdered children  buried in the yards of the religious organizations that kidnapped them. I shouldn't *need* to explain that \"religious abuse\" is a reasonable hypothesis to float when observing maladaptive behavior like dealing with a real-life problem by asking your friends to talk to their imaginary friend about it. \n\nBut again, you've clearly decided your energy is best spent scoffing at the people who are skeptical that individuals raised in a culture that taught them to revere *rapers and killers of children* might be motivated by less than healthy though patterns. You do you, fam. I'm staying on the right side of history and standing up, unilaterally and without reservation, against the killers and with the dead and their families.", "Oooooo-kay. So your reading comprehension is so low you don't understand the distinction between \"being wrong\" in the factual sense, and being \"in the wrong\" in the ethical sense. That explains a lot.", "You are fine. Carter pushed a button and you pushed back. It sounds like he has serious doubts about being wanted by his parents and you didn't know that beforehand.\n\nIt might help both of you to get together over a couple of beers and talk that out. Let him know you didn't mean anything by it and give him the chance to explain what his childhood was like.", "Nta", "NTA.  He took a shot at you, and couldn't take one in return.  And your joke was a pretty darn mild one, too!", "Lol NTA. It\u2019s a fair and funny comeback and it\u2019s on him if he\u2019s choosing to take it so seriously.", "NTA. Does he think adopted children just spawn into existence? & it\u2019s not like your type of adoption is rare at all. He\u2019s just an idiot that embarrassed himself but didn\u2019t want to own it.", "\u201cI was kind of surprised how long it took me for my dad to notice our suitcases.\u201d\n\nWhat am I missing here?  I don\u2019t get this statement at all.", "YTA Your joke was more tasteless than the original joker.", "NTA\n\nI'm betting Carter was an oops baby and knows it.", "NTA. If he can't take it, he shouldn't dish it.", "Yep! He could dish it out, but couldn't take it.", "> I get the distinct impression that Carter feels unwanted.\n\nFeenish heem!", "I was talking about a family vacation this summer, which Carter responded to with his comment about my adoption.", "Legit my question. Adopted or not, they all spent around 9 months in somebody's body and they all wouldn't know what it was like to wait for them. So what does he mean?? I can only see this making sense as a \"What would you know, you're an only child\" since older siblings know, but well, not what he said.", "On one hand, I am glad this word became such a popular buzzword because it forced a lot of people to re-examine toxic behaviors amongst their friends and families.  On the other hand, you have so many people who met someone who was vaguely rude to them who are now under the impression that they are somehow a victim of being gaslit", "Ethics doesn't come into it, beyond not stereotyping a billion diverse people.\n\nYou're just splitting hairs, which is ironic seeing as you like to support blurring things together."]}
