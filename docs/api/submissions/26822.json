What this means - at least in my case - was that I was put up for adoption before I was born. My birth-mother chose my parents several months in advance, and when I left the hospital, I went home with them. My parents (69F and 56M) are the only parents I\u2019ve ever known, but I\u2019ve known that I was adopted since the age of 3. I\u2019m open to talking about it but it\u2019s never been something that I\u2019ve considered a bad or negative part of my personal history. I know my parents love me and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever needed to know. \n\nI guess the situation in question came from my confidence in my adoption? I don\u2019t really know what else to call it. \n\nMy friends and I are all 18-20 and all sophomores in college. We joke around a lot, and while this does include some darker topics, we\u2019re all pretty close so it\u2019s never been an issue until now. A few nights ago, we were joking about our parents and our respective family vacations at dinner and I said something like: \u201cI was kinda surprised how long it took for my dad to notice our suitcases.

You\u2019re adopted!\u201d I just said, \u201cat least I know my parents wanted me.\u201d I then reached for my water and everyone else laughed again, but Carter rolled his eyes and stayed silent until he left.

Does he think you weren\u2019t born after 9 months in the womb because you were adopted or that your parents didn\u2019t have to wait that long\u2026 don\u2019t adoptions usually take longer!!", "Nah fam, you ain't the asshole. Even if they weren't your biological parents, they still raised you like their own and that's what matters most. Sometimes people don't realize how much power words have- so try not to take it too serious.", "NTA, he tried to weaponize your adoption against you and you turned it back on him. Tell him he's just mad that you did it better. \n\nAlso tell him to stop using pseudo-therapy speak to get his way.", "The only reasonable interpretation I have for Carter's behavior is that he has a pretty bad relationship with his parents. And if you knew that then this was an uncalled for low blow.\n\nBut it sounds like everybody was joking around in a light-hearted way. \n\nIf you mostly like him as a friend, I'd apologize for accidentally hurting his feelings. Be sure that you don't say that you said anything wrong, because you didn't. You're aiming for something like: \"Carter, I didn't mean to upset you with my joke. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings... but I also wonder if everything is all right?\"\n\nOn the other hand, if he's mostly a bit overdramatic, I wouldn't bother.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. The \"my parents wanted me\" response is the tried and true response to anyone rude enough to comment on someone's adoptive status. You didn't weaponise anything. Carter was rude, you shut it down. If he feels attacked he shouldn't have gone for you first.\n\nDon't dish it if you can't take it.", "NTA\n\nCarter can dish it out, but he can't take it.", "I know Carter and his family are pretty close, though he butts heads with his mom a lot. But he\u2019s always asked us to pray for guidance for them whenever that happens, so I don\u2019t know.", "Carter is the one person in the group that I don\u2019t see (or connect with) often, as he\u2019s busy being an RA. He\u2019s never been like this around me before, but the other guys know him way better than I do", "I don\u2019t really know how Carter and his family are relationship-wise, aside from that they\u2019re pretty close, though he butts heads with his mom a lot. But he\u2019s always asked us to pray for guidance for them whenever that happens, so I don\u2019t know. The guys are closer with him than me, but they don\u2019t know why he acted like that either.", "NTA Its a legitamite move under the \"they started it\" rule.", "Nta. Sounds like he was intentionally trying to make you uncomfortable. That is not ok. Adoption is a beautiful thing. Esp when its not held as a secret. I don't see anything wrong with what you said but def sounds like hes resentful or trying to upset you.  Saying that at least you know you were wanted isnt weaponizing adoption. Its a beautiful way to look at it.", "Carter said something pretty nasty to you.  You responded less nastily.  You didn't weaponize your adoption, you offered a nasty \"friend\" a winning retort and he couldn't take it.  \n\nCarter is the A here.  You have nothing to feel bad about.\n\nNTA", "well you burned him with his fire. NTA", "Sigh\u2026 just say he started it - and his comment didn\u2019t even make any sense. \n\nHe\u2019s trying or make that bad feeling go away by blaming you. Just don\u2019t take it in.", "NTA. He started it and you finished it.", "NTA You are absolutely correct \" you were CHOSEN\". Your parents chose you to be their child, and your birth mother made sure she chose the right parents for you. Being an orphan is sad and not fun, but then you get chosen, and you are the light of your parents' eyes that is awesome. It seems like Carter is jealous!", "Don't dish it out if you can't take it, Carter. \n\nIf this is a sensitive topic for him, then he was making himself feel better by denigrating you. He's a bully. The only person weaponising anything here is him. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIf i would playfully insult someone like that, i would be ready to tke the comeback.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE was the AH, and got called out for it.", "NTA. I have had my eldest grandson since his birth, he is now 16. While my youngest birth son is now 25. Grandson took to calling us mom and dad, even though he knows his biological situation. They fought alot growing up as the baby was no longer the baby; and sibling rivalry.  One day I heard them fighting over me. He yelled at least my mom wanted me and only has you because she had to...I jumped in at that point and told them that though I wanted him, I kept him because I gave birth to him, but that I chose the grandson. Was that cruel of me? Yes, very. But he got a dose of his own medicine and now considers him his brother. (they were 19 and 10 at the time)", "NTA\n\nHe's acting childish.", "That\u2019s such an odd reaction from Carter \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYour quip is almost like one of those \u201cyou\u2019re so ugly your Mamma had to sling shot feed you\u201d type jokes etc - it\u2019s just silly!! \n\nNTA", "NTA it was a funny joke", "umm what? NTA also what he said does not even make sense, I am not adopted and I have no idea what it means to wait 9 months for a baby... because I do not have one.", "Oooo. Guessing you caught a bit close to truth. He is an ass for trying to use your adoption and you\u2019re nta because most babies are accidents.", "NTA - He tried to be clever and insult you and you tunred it around on him\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood for you", "NTA. He is jut annoyed with your comeback lol", "NTA, the jokes were at the same level, so if he took it that bad, he should not be giving punches he can't stand receiving. If he has family issues, then it makes sense he is hurt, but it isn't your fault in any way", "nta I feel like weaponizing is gonna be the new word thrown around for a while", "Nta", "NTA. Your supposed friend can dish it out but can't take it. His behavior is not okay.", "NTA. His comment makes absolutely no sense.", "NTA. Your response was perfect. He is an AH and he is the one who \u201c weaponized \u201c your adoption.", "Yeah I think he was frustrated that his attempt to look clever/funny fell flat. The thing is it\u2019s not that serious.", "Right? I don't even get what he's saying. Shouldn't Carter's \"joke\" be directed at OP's parents? Why would OP and any of the friend group know what it's like waiting to have a baby unless they are already parents? Why does he get to comment on OP's adoption but OP can't use it back?\n\nI'd stay clear of this guy. He sounds stupid and mean.", "Exactly", "I think Carter has an issue with his birth story that OP doesn't know.   \nIt's not anyone fault and Carter should just brush it off as fair play but him being vexed is understandable.", "Amazing. I'm adopted too and have often used this! NTA at all. \n\nI've said a few times before, my parents had to bend over backwards to get me me, whereas others just had to bend over. You get enough stick for being adopted. Might aswell use it to fight back", "If he's asking for prayers, then it's likely he's Christian. \n\nAnd as someone who was raised in the Christian church, I can honestly say that there is no hatred more vile than Christian \"love\".", "I\u2019m betting carter either A. Has a crush on you or B. His small little man ego got hurt bc a girl matched his energy when joking and he can\u2019t take it", "Why do people give you crap about being adopted. You know you were wanted, you just didn't happen!", "That is a *glorious* turn of phrase! Damn!"]}
