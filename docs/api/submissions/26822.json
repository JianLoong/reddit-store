I know my parents love me and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever needed to know. \n\nI guess the situation in question came from my confidence in my adoption?

Be sure that you don't say that you said anything wrong, because you didn't. You're aiming for something like: \"Carter, I didn't mean to upset you with my joke.
