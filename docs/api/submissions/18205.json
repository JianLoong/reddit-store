As for his daughter she says she is a toddler and one day she barely eats and the next asks for more and that is normal.\n\nTo that I argued that I always had a specific amount of food for everyone and that went well, she then had the audacity to say maybe that is why my son eats so fast as if the food is running away and then she started with that crap that her food is always healthy and that it is wrong to control what other people eat, and that my granddaughter and my son are actually both at healthy weight but that is not really my point. She should not let my granddaughter grow up to be greedy with food.\n\nAnyway now she is mad and saying that if I cannot keep my comments in my brain (her words) I will not be welcome to their home and managed to turn my son and my husband against me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo AITA here?

This is because children learn to feel that they aren't going to be fed enough and this leads to \"problematic eating patterns\" like the \"insurance hypothesis\"--where you eat even when you aren't hungry because you worry that you may not be able to eat when you *are* hungry.

It\u2019s one thing to set limits on the amount of high calorie, low nutrition snacks/ meals a kid eats, make mostly healthy foods, and generally encourage healthy eating habits (which it seems likely your DIL does), and another to monitor and control every calorie that passes their lips, and even when resources are available to prevent them from leaving a meal still hungry/being hungry soon after, denying them further sustenance than what you\u2019ve decided (I\u2019m assuming without any education in dietetics or metabolic data too) they deserve.

Did you get yourself the same amount every time or had you days where you feels you earned more, because you worked hard? Is your life that boring, that you need to micromanage other people's food choices? The worst that will happen is that your granddaughter learns a healthy relationship with food and knows when she is full and to get herself the right amount of food every time an learns to say no, because there is no artificial shortage of food", "YTA you need to mind your business.\n\nFirst off your son is a grown ass man. He doesn\u2019t need someone policing his food. If his mommy has to look out for him the way you are your dil needs to rethink her marriage.\n\nAs for your grand daughter. You are not her parent. Your DIL is her mom. Keep this up and you will not be allowed to be around your grandchild. The DIL doesn\u2019t need a backseat parent telling her how to raise HER CHILD! You need to learn to stay in your lane and mind your own business. It doesn\u2019t mater what you did at your house this is her house and she can run HER HOME AND FAMILY the way she see fit!\n\nSecond your DIL really needs to limit your contact with her child. Stop telling her how to raise her child. If your son needs mommy looking over his shoulder now that he is a grown ass man then obviously you failed at parenting and shouldn\u2019t be giving anyone else advise.\n\nIn a few months when the DIL is tired of your meddling in things that do not concern you and frankly none of your damn business and decides. It have you around HER CHILD let me save you the time and energy on wonder why! Because you can\u2019t mind your damn business!", "Huge YTA \n1 IT IS NOT YOUR HOUSE!!! YOU HAVE NO SAY!!!\n2. Have you not heard of leftovers???? Are you that delusional???\n3. Sounds like you controlled how your family ate to the point of being an almond mom. You would probably make a salad with just lettuce and say that\u2019s the meal. \n4. YOU HAVE NO SAY", "This is hilarious! Thanks for the laughs OP. Your DIL sounds amazing and YTA.", "YTA.  It\u2019s not your household and she is clearly making enough food so that everybody will be satisfied, and is purposefully making enough for leftovers.  She is feeding her daughter what she thinks is the right amount of food in a way that she thinks is best for her development.  Your son is an adult who can decide for himself how to control (or not control) his own portions. \n\nGiven the way that you think that your way is more important even in her house, you should give a thought as to whether what she said is true - somebody so pushy and entitled like you may want to think about your unhealthy view of food and people having access to food.  But either way, you ran your household as you wanted, and she is running hers as she wants.  Your problem is not only that you made this comment - it is that you made the comment with the expectation that she would start doing things exactly as you want it.  She is correct to say that you should keep these comments to yourself. It is not your place and quite frankly, it is an unhealthy view to have.\n\nAlso, your granddaughter is not just \u201chis daughter\u201d - it is her daughter, too. You know, their daughter together.", "YTA are paying their bills? Are you buying their food? No? Than this does not concern you in the slightest. You are trying to be controlling with people that don\u2019t even live with you. Mind your own business", "> my son is a grown man and if he wishes to eat less, he can do that without her having to \"mom\" him around\n\nShe's right.\n\n> maybe that is why my son eats so fast as if the food is running away\n\nShe may have a point, have you ever thought about this?\n\n> She should not let my granddaughter grow up to be greedy with food.\n\nWhy would she grow up greedy if she doesn't have to stress around food, like your son had to?\n\nYTA. Get a grip, and be happy your son found a woman with a brain.", "YTA How does it \"not make sense\" that leftovers are used for a meal the next day? If you want to restrict someone's food, restrict your own.", "You are a control freak.  You need to butt out or you will vist your son his marriage.", "No, just eating disorders \ud83d\ude0f", "Leftovers are the best part. I cook for 1 90% of the time and I always cook enough for 3-4 extra portions. A: so I can have leftovers the next day and B: so I can have some food in the freezer for days I really cant be arsed.\n\nYTA OP its non of your bloody business how your DIL cooks. You son is a grown ass man, he doesn't need mommy monitoring his eating habits. And if he isn't happy about the way his wife cooks then he should be the one doing all cooking.\n\nEdit to add; your DIL didn't turn your son and husband against you. Your actions alone did that", "yo I love her DIL too...like didn't take any shit from the first sentence. shut it down hard and clear.\n\nif anything it sounds like mom gave son some serious issues with food as well and now he's livin the dream\n\nYTA mama...let DIL steer this ship she's got it tight and right", "I wonder if they are living together.  I got the impression they all might be in a country where multi-generational households are common.  Regardless, OP trying to control how her DIL feeds DIL's family is YTA behavior.", "She wouldn\u2019t be watching my child either. I don\u2019t want someone to give my child insecurity or cause them a eating disorder because they limited thier access to food.
