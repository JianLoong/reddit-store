As for his daughter she says she is a toddler and one day she barely eats and the next asks for more and that is normal.\n\nTo that I argued that I always had a specific amount of food for everyone and that went well, she then had the audacity to say maybe that is why my son eats so fast as if the food is running away and then she started with that crap that her food is always healthy and that it is wrong to control what other people eat, and that my granddaughter and my son are actually both at healthy weight but that is not really my point. She should not let my granddaughter grow up to be greedy with food.\n\nAnyway now she is mad and saying that if I cannot keep my comments in my brain (her words) I will not be welcome to their home and managed to turn my son and my husband against me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo AITA here?

This is because children learn to feel that they aren't going to be fed enough and this leads to \"problematic eating patterns\" like the \"insurance hypothesis\"--where you eat even when you aren't hungry because you worry that you may not be able to eat when you *are* hungry.

But my husband and I might have to work 3 jobs each to keep him fed as a teenager.", "Eh, if we weren\u2019t talking about restrictive portions, then allowing everyone to eat until full without controlled portions wouldn\u2019t be an issue to you. \n\nOP\u2019s (unhealthy) concerns raised are 100% about restricting eating.", "Replying again to your edit: Helping kids grow with good nutrition and a healthy relationship with food is hard. Maybe talk with your child\u2019s pediatrician or a registered dietician. They can brainstorm with you about healthy ways to foster this, help you understand what is normal, and help you understand the risks of certain parenting practices. \n\nFWIW, I\u2019m a healthcare professional with some specialized education in an adjacent area, and also a mom.", "Ok, then please see the references listed in comments to you. This is considered abuse and neglect whether or not you don\u2019t like it or are ignorant of the harm.", "If portioning food is abuse, why are serving sizes and recommended daily calorie intake measurements still used by nutrition experts everywhere? If portioning food is abusive, do ya'll just eat straight from the same pot on the stove? Or do you give yourself a smaller **portion** of the food you prepared and divide the rest among the others eating at your table? Does one serving of ice cream give the same nutition benefits as a serving of broccoli?\n\nMy 7 year olds body tells him he needs ice cream every single day. And I should allow that? Seriously?\n\nThis thread is unhinged.", "He would absolutely report every parent who was portioning their child's food in such a way that they were not being provided enough food on a daily basis, which is very clearly what is being discussed in this thread.\n\nHe would not report parents for taking their children out to a restaurant. Most restaurant portions in America are so big that they're enough for like one full meal, plus another full meal of leftovers, so taking your child to a restaurant would not be considered a failure to provide adequate food. \n\nAlso, as someone lucky enough to not have to deal with parents who restricted our food intake, if I ever got to the end of a restaurant meal and I was still hungry, they'd give me leftover food from their plates, or we'd order more food, or I could grab a sandwich from home! Because I had really lovely non-neglectful parents who would never have wanted us or anyone else to go to bed hungry.", "What edit? My son is super healthy and eats healthy portions of a variety of foods. His doctors are very pleased with his health factors, and portioning food is recommended for everyone by doctors:\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/diet/ss/slideshow-serving-sizes", "Well if you call it abuse or neglect then she has to think about what she's doing to her own kids. Easier to argue with everyone on the internet.", "The book \u201cRunning on Empty\u201d by Dr. Jonice Webb helped me a lot. It might be interesting for you to look at. \n\nA lot of parents unintentionally do things that really mess up their kids. Because it was unintentional doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t harmful.", "That\u2019s a very uneducated stance. I work in early child development and mental health. No one said you should let your child eat ice cream all day. That\u2019s obtuse and disingenuous. Best practice is to feed children on a schedule. The parent decides what foods are offered, the child decides which of those foods to eat and how much. Portioning and restricting foods leads to eating disorders, and disordered relationships with foods. I have suffered with an ED my whole life due to the way my parents fed me as a child. Both of my children have learned to listen to their bodies. Even when offered unlimited ice cream they will only eat a small amount and stop when they are full. They almost never finish when we go to an ice cream place. Just the fact that you admit your 7 year old has an obsession with ice cream and wants it all the time shows how your food restriction is affecting them. Get some therapy before your issues hurt your children.", "My kids - even my bottomless pit son - have never finished a meal at a restaurant.", "Lol, you added the bit on about your child. \n\nTalk with your child\u2019s doctor more. You are confused about what portioning for a child means.\n\nETA: what is considered best practice is for the parent to decide what is offered and available. The child decides what and how much of it they eat. Kids need both growth and nutrition AND a healthy relationship with food. Being overly controlled risks harm.", "Seems accurate.", "Lol fuck right off. Portioning simply means making sure he's not taking 4 servings of meat and grains to a fraction of a serving of vegetables. Portioning keeps serving sizes appropriate for a healthy diet. Portioning is recommended by doctors. Portioning is why we have \"serving size\" listed on all foods. It's how healthy people eat. Unless you just eat straight from the pots and pans on the stove, *you also portion your meals.*\n\nThe hive mind of Reddit sees \"portioning\" and their teeny tiny brains must think \"rationing.\" These are not the same."]}
