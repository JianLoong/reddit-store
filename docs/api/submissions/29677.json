As we grew up my mom basically left us with my grandparents (her parents) and my dad would have us on weekends. As the years went on they became more civil, they both ended up getting remarried. In the past say 20 years since the grandchildren started they have been friendly to one another for the Grand kids, nothing more than that.Fast Forward now to October of last year we lost my father and he left a decent sized inheritance, nothing that I can quit my job over, but enought that I can finally fix up my house and have a college fund for all my kids so they never have to deal with the stuff most kids nowadays have to deal with.Things were fine for awhile or so I thought, but eventually my mom asked us both for \"a little money\" in which we begrudginly gave her some each. That settled everything down for a few weeks until last month she came to my house spouting off about how we should have given her more money and how she deserves 10K from EACH of us. I told her that was absolutley not going to happen as not only was the money needed for MY KIDS futures, but to be completley honest I think my father would be rolling in his grave if he knew we gave her the initial little amount let alone $10 THOUSAND DOLLARS.So Reddit AITA?\n\nUpdate\n\nWow this got a lot of attention after posting in the middle of the night while ranting... Thank you to each and every person that commented, You have made me realize myself and my brother are doing the right thing by doing what the will states. I havent talked to her since it came out that she wants the money and I have no intention of talking to her anymore so that wont be an issue. My brother on the other hand IDK what his plan is, as thats not my decision.\n\nEdit 1. Fast Forward now to October of last year we lost my Grandfather.

Not how it works. \n\nWhy did she not make use of the time she didn\u2019t have to take care of you to try and save some money and build a career?\n\nHer stupidity is not your responsibility.

If it was, he would have written this detail in his will: End of discussion.\n\nCan she be upset and say mean things? Yes but don't let it sway you. Remain firm on your decision.  You have been given a gift so be a good steward and meet the meaningful goals you mentioned. Sorry you are experiencing this but honestly, she's acting like an ahole.", "NTA. A Will is called is called \u2018the last testament and will\u2019 of someone\u2019s wishes for where they want their belongings and/or money to go, after their death.

If you choose to **give** her money, then good for you. But honestly, for me personally, I would only consider *giving* someone money if they asked politely. If they tried to guilt me into it, somehow, then my potential beneficence would turn into a hard no.", "NTA. Though confused who left you the $. You say your grandfather then later referred to your dad dad rolling over in his grave that you gave her anything. You also talk about her relationship with your dad in the post, and being raised by her parents, your grandparents. \n\nEither way,  If it was your grandfather (her father) that left you the $, if your grandfather felt as his daughter \u201cshe deserved\u201d 20k of his money he would have left it for her, he didn\u2019t, end of story. If it was your father or your grandfather on his side, she got what \u201cshe deserved\u201d from being married to your dad in the divorce settlement. So she is owed nothing there as well.\n\nJust in general no one is automatically owed an inheritance from anyone unless that person dies without a will, then state laws dictate who is owed the inheritance. Otherwise, who gets, a inheritance of anyone who passes is the person/persons named in the will, period. Be that their SO, children, parents, charity, or even the family dog.", "NTA. Your mother doesn't have any right to that money and should be thankful for what you gave her already. She's entitled for coming to you and *demanding* more.", "NTA\n\nIt seems your grandfather knew that you and your brother deserved the inheritance more than your deadbeat mother.  Honor his decision by saying no to your mom.", "Ya I thought the same thing. Reread it a few times loI.\nI think it\u2019s just a mess up tho. Based on the mother wanting money and talking about the divorce, I\u2019m gonna say it was the father that left the money.", "May your memories of your grandfather be a blessing.\n\nIf her dad wanted her to have the money, he would have left it to her.   He didn\u2019t.   Use the money how you wish, and those seem like good ways.  No.  It is a complete sentence.

It\u2019s obvious your grandparents were disappointed in her.", "If your father had intended it for your mother, he would have left her some.  This is about your mom feeling entitled to some.\n\nReminds me of my own mother when my father died. They'd been divorced for over 25 years and she would not even speak to him or be in the same town as him yet felt she was entitled to some money from his estate.  She told me I should be helping her financially, this bearing in mind that she owns her own home, has holidayed overseas and recently updated her car for another new one.  I suggested since my brothers were her favorite growing up that she should trying asking them!", "NTA, except for writing a confusing post. Who left you the money? You say it was your grandfather but then say your dad would spin in his grave. So, I'm guessing it wasn't your mother's father.

Why she expects money from his estate NOW makes no sense.  It is just her being selfish.", "Not the asshole that was your inheritance from your father They were divorced for many years she is deserving of nothing.", "Nta. Give her nothing.", "NTA.  Cut all contact with the beggar.", "If your grandfather had wanted her to have an inheritance from him, he would have left it to her in his will. He didn't, deliberately.  Don't do it.

You take that money and set yourself up.", "NTA\n\nShe isn't entitled to anything he didn't leave her. I'm guessing this is the grandfather that raised you for her, and she might have gotten something if she'd actually, you know, raised her own children. Your grandfather has always taken care of you, OP, don't let your mother guilt you into giving her anything more.\n\nEdit: based on the edit, she STILL isn't entitled to anything because they were no longer married. She gets no spousal benefits, and still isn't entitled to anything she wasn't left in the will.", "NTA at all. If he wanted to give her money, he would have. Demanding $20k from her children after already receiving a monetary gift is ridiculous. If she is experiencing financial problems, this is not the way to handle it.", "INTA I'm guessing your mother never contributed  financially and left the job of bringing you up to her parents. She probably owed them money. In any case, if they had wanted to leave her a part of the inheritance, they would have. Don't give her a cent, and share the post and comments with your brother.\nEdit. I got confused regarding father vs grandfather. If it was inheritance from your father, her expectation of money is even more ridiculous.", "NTA Tell her you considered it, but then subtracted the $10 K from the child support she should have been paying for you over the years. Then ask her for the remaining sum.", "NTA\n\nSo...why does a parent who ditched her kids with their grandparents deserve 10k per child? Sounds like she was running around unburdened by children long enough to make a substantial nestegg for herself...", "NTA. If your grandpa her DAD want d her to have more money or any money (you didn\u2019t say if she was even in the will) he would have left her more. She isn\u2019t entitled to shit. I\u2019d tell stop demanding money form me and if she continues that I would cut her out of my life and my kids life. Nobody has time for a greedy selfish asshole.", "NTA- she would\u2019ve been left money if the deceased wanted her to have it, simple as that", "NTA. If father wanted mother to have the funds, that would have been stated in the will. \"...doing what the will states.\" is the right thing to do, for your future, for your kids' future.", "NTA - If your Father wanted her to have money, he would've left some to her.

Crazy that you guys didn\u2019t think of her when your father died. Terrible kids", "NTA. My parents were married 25 years but had been separated about 10 years and both remarried when my dad died. My dad had a good life insurance policy but when he began his employment he was still married to my mom so that\u2019s who was on the beneficiary. My 3 siblings and I, plus step mom couldn\u2019t get any money unless my mom signed off on it. She did so without asking for money and my step mom got $60k. I gave her some money bc she didn\u2019t have to do that, but she wanted to for her kids. Your mom sounds entitled and she didn\u2019t seem to care when someone else was raising you. I would\u2019ve probably given her a little bit so she\u2019d leave it alone but I wouldn\u2019t give her any more. \n\nWe don\u2019t always have to feel obligated to help. My bf has a different circumstance, he is making a lot more money now and he said he wasn\u2019t going to give his mom any money.  she was always mean to him growing up and never worked.
