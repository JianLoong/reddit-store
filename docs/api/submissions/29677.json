If it was, he would have written this detail in his will: End of discussion.\n\nCan she be upset and say mean things? Yes but don't let it sway you. Remain firm on your decision.

A Will is called is called \u2018the last testament and will\u2019 of someone\u2019s wishes for where they want their belongings and/or money to go, after their death.

Saying her chances of $10k are higher with the lottery than from you.", "NTA.\n\nYou do not **owe** your mom any money, and she's an asshole for implying that you do. If you choose to **give** her money, then good for you. But honestly, for me personally, I would only consider *giving* someone money if they asked politely. If they tried to guilt me into it, somehow, then my potential beneficence would turn into a hard no.", "NTA. Though confused who left you the $. You say your grandfather then later referred to your dad dad rolling over in his grave that you gave her anything. You also talk about her relationship with your dad in the post, and being raised by her parents, your grandparents. \n\nEither way,  If it was your grandfather (her father) that left you the $, if your grandfather felt as his daughter \u201cshe deserved\u201d 20k of his money he would have left it for her, he didn\u2019t, end of story. If it was your father or your grandfather on his side, she got what \u201cshe deserved\u201d from being married to your dad in the divorce settlement. So she is owed nothing there as well.\n\nJust in general no one is automatically owed an inheritance from anyone unless that person dies without a will, then state laws dictate who is owed the inheritance. Otherwise, who gets, a inheritance of anyone who passes is the person/persons named in the will, period. Be that their SO, children, parents, charity, or even the family dog.", "NTA. Your mother doesn't have any right to that money and should be thankful for what you gave her already. She's entitled for coming to you and *demanding* more.", "NTA\n\nIt seems your grandfather knew that you and your brother deserved the inheritance more than your deadbeat mother.  Honor his decision by saying no to your mom.", "Ya I thought the same thing. Reread it a few times loI.\nI think it\u2019s just a mess up tho. Based on the mother wanting money and talking about the divorce, I\u2019m gonna say it was the father that left the money."]}
