If your dad wanted her to have that money he would have given her that money. It's yours so keep it. Maybe it's time to revisit your relationship with your mother.", "NTA. \n\nShe pounds you off to her parents to raise you, divorces your dad and now wants MORE money than what you gave her?! Not how it works. \n\nWhy did she not make use of the time she didn\u2019t have to take care of you to try and save some money and build a career?\n\nHer stupidity is not your responsibility. She\u2019s pulling a grift on you. Don\u2019t budge.", "NTA! She\u2019s being greedy. If he wanted to leave her any money he would of have. It\u2019s yours to do as you please. Don\u2019t let her manipulate or guilt trip you. Stand your ground.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIf your grandfather wanted her to have that money, he would have left it to her.", "NTA - it's your money you can do whatever you want with it. Strange that she feels she has any claim on that money after 35 years..", "NTA - She feels entitled to something that is not hers. If it was, he would have written this detail in his will: End of discussion.\n\nCan she be upset and say mean things? Yes but don't let it sway you. Remain firm on your decision.  You have been given a gift so be a good steward and meet the meaningful goals you mentioned. Sorry you are experiencing this but honestly, she's acting like an ahole.", "NTA. A Will is called is called \u2018the last testament and will\u2019 of someone\u2019s wishes for where they want their belongings and/or money to go, after their death. Clearly, your grandfather made his decisions. Giver $5 and tell her to buy some lottery tickets. Saying her chances of $10k are higher with the lottery than from you.", "NTA.\n\nYou do not **owe** your mom any money, and she's an asshole for implying that you do. If you choose to **give** her money, then good for you. But honestly, for me personally, I would only consider *giving* someone money if they asked politely. If they tried to guilt me into it, somehow, then my potential beneficence would turn into a hard no.", "NTA. Though confused who left you the $. You say your grandfather then later referred to your dad dad rolling over in his grave that you gave her anything. You also talk about her relationship with your dad in the post, and being raised by her parents, your grandparents. \n\nEither way,  If it was your grandfather (her father) that left you the $, if your grandfather felt as his daughter \u201cshe deserved\u201d 20k of his money he would have left it for her, he didn\u2019t, end of story. If it was your father or your grandfather on his side, she got what \u201cshe deserved\u201d from being married to your dad in the divorce settlement. So she is owed nothing there as well.\n\nJust in general no one is automatically owed an inheritance from anyone unless that person dies without a will, then state laws dictate who is owed the inheritance. Otherwise, who gets, a inheritance of anyone who passes is the person/persons named in the will, period. Be that their SO, children, parents, charity, or even the family dog.", "NTA. Your mother doesn't have any right to that money and should be thankful for what you gave her already. She's entitled for coming to you and *demanding* more.", "NTA\n\nIt seems your grandfather knew that you and your brother deserved the inheritance more than your deadbeat mother.  Honor his decision by saying no to your mom.", "Ya I thought the same thing. Reread it a few times loI.\nI think it\u2019s just a mess up tho. Based on the mother wanting money and talking about the divorce, I\u2019m gonna say it was the father that left the money.", "May your memories of your grandfather be a blessing.\n\nIf her dad wanted her to have the money, he would have left it to her.   He didn\u2019t.   Use the money how you wish, and those seem like good ways.  No.  It is a complete sentence.   In this case I would also add, after a pause, \u201cgetting louder and yelling will not change my answer\u201d", "NTA\n\nYour mother abandoned you to her parents and if your grandparents wanted her to have the money, they would have left her some. It\u2019s obvious your grandparents were disappointed in her.", "If your father had intended it for your mother, he would have left her some.  This is about your mom feeling entitled to some.\n\nReminds me of my own mother when my father died. They'd been divorced for over 25 years and she would not even speak to him or be in the same town as him yet felt she was entitled to some money from his estate.  She told me I should be helping her financially, this bearing in mind that she owns her own home, has holidayed overseas and recently updated her car for another new one.  I suggested since my brothers were her favorite growing up that she should trying asking them!", "NTA, except for writing a confusing post. Who left you the money? You say it was your grandfather but then say your dad would spin in his grave. So, I'm guessing it wasn't your mother's father. Was it your dad or his father?", "This can't be real.", "NTA, she needs to stop being greedy.", "NTA. She was purposely left out of the inheritance.", "NTA\nIn fact why don't you ask for her to return the initial \"loan\" and then you'd consider it...\nBloody cheek of the woman.", "NTA", "NTA! \n\nHe made his choice, you are honouring it - end of story", "NTA", "NTA so NTA i would ask for the initial cash back  um good luck", "NTA your mom sounds evil.

Would you do that to your kids? Would you want your parents to do that to you?", "And if he caved and gave her the $10,000, she\u2019d probably come back in another month begging for more. OP is NTA and well within his right to not give anymore money as it is, but the absentee parenting of his mother post-divorce is especially not worthy of financial compensation.", "Ask her which grandchild should skip college for her to have this money.", "Your mother doesn't have any right to that money and should be thankful for what you gave her already. She's entitled for coming to you and demanding more."]}
