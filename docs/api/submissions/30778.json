We live in a very small village and have had a guest explosion in the past.  We have never turned anyone away.  I think paying fees that the parents with extra kids should pay those fees.  We also plan on parents staying.  Being in a rural area some people drive an hour or so to come to the party so they get to stay.  The last party was from 2 to 4..they were still there after 4.  But we may be in a totally different boat with the ability to stretch resources to add more and there is always the local grocery with sheet cakes.

Plus with 28 kids in this situation, that\u2019s already an enormous group to handle.

I\u2019m an experienced kid birthday party thrower and goer. It\u2019s okay to write on the invitation that siblings are not invited in whatever wording you choose. Don\u2019t feel guilty. Of that means some kids can\u2019t come, then that\u2019s what that means. It\u2019s a part of life and you can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm.

An extra box of cake mix costs a dollar...", ">If you're inviting your friends to your birthday party, are they coming with their cousins, brothers and aunts in tow?\n\nI mean this example just proves my point - if someone I invited to a party said \"Hey, my brother is in town staying with me, would you mind if they tag along?\" I would not consider that question to be rude. I might say no, or yes, but I wouldn't think it rude to ask... Seems like a weird thing to get sensitive about.", "Sounds like you\u2019re from guess culture. In ask culture: Asking is not rude or assuming. It\u2019s asking.", "You literally need to include that in your original post then.\n\nLike I said, there's a difference between the parents asking to include other siblings at the PARTY and the parents asking if they can use the BUSINESS simultaneously if it's open to the public.\n\nSo if you rented the venue and it's therefore closed to the public, include that detail in your post for us to clarify it.\n\nAs I also said before, NTA for not including kids that aren't invited. But I also don't see the harm in the parents asking if their other kids can come; there shouldn't be harm in asking, especially as evident in the comments the expectations are vastly different family to family. Plus the parents may not have known that you'd rented out the whole establishment for the party, so again, no harm in asking. The issue comes when they don't take no for an answer.\n\nI, personally, wouldn't have seen their asking as rude or insulting, because you don't know until you ask, but the one parent that pushed back was definitely rude.", "I've been looking through my old photo albums with my toddler and I can tell you that the other parents never stayed. Not when we were five and not when we were older either. Most kids start attending school at four, do five would be the first birthday for a kids party with invites etc. \n\nWe had small parties though. With 2 friends each (I'm part of a twin set).

Older siblings usually are the ones who complain about having to bring their younger ones along, but I was brought along for her benefit!", "Maybe for you but some people scrimp and save for months ahead of time to even afford the bare bones party.

Extra cake, food, drinks, goodie bags/favors.. it\u2019s not \u201cjust a box of cake mix\u201d. And not to mention, typically venues plan space for a specific amount of kids per group. It would be like reserving a table for 6 at a restaurant then showing up with 20 and still expecting to be accommodated. AND sometimes parents drop their kids off and pick them up after the party which leaves OP responsible for them. Which is fine if it\u2019s a handful of kids, but lots of extras are a lot of extra responsibility and work.
