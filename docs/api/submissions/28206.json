My SIL always criticized my son because of how his long hair makes him look like a girl. She decided to cut his hair while he was sleeping and he was devastated. When I got home he told me what happened then I told her she had a week to leave before I called the police. She told my that wasn\u2019t fair since she did him a favor. She said people would make fun of him for having long hair even though it never happened in the 3 years he\u2019s been in high school. I told my brother he could stay if he wanted to because he had nothing to do with it.  Everyone but my mother and SIL agrees with me but they are calling me an asshole because I unfairly kicked out my SIL.

Whether cutting someone's hair while they are sleeping can be considered assault with a deadly weapon causing bodily harm would likely depend on the specific circumstances, the jurisdiction, and the interpretation of the law.\r  \n\r  \nIn general, assault with a deadly weapon typically involves the use of a weapon or object capable of causing serious physical harm or death. Cutting someone's hair without their consent may not typically be considered a deadly weapon. However, if the act resulted in bodily harm or if the victim experienced significant emotional distress or trauma, it might be possible to pursue charges related to assault, battery, or other offenses depending on the laws in your jurisdiction.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance specific to your situation and the applicable laws in your area. Laws and definitions can vary significantly from one place to another, and legal outcomes can depend on many factors, including the intent of the person involved and the extent of harm caused\".", "NTA.
