If she\u2019s a nanny there is a good chance her training makes her better at handling an emergency than many parents and probably had a background check done on her. So it\u2019s probably safer to leave him with her than the parents that you trust.", "\u201cHer only connection to the children or incentive to care for them is money.\u201d    \n     \n\nWoah, woah, hold up, you\u2019re telling me that this woman is out here treating her job like it\u2019s a JOB?! And that she expects to be PAID for her job?! Good heavens, what a horrible thing! You\u2019re right to distrust such a morally reprehensible person! /s    \nThis is the dumbest shit I\u2019ve read all day. YTA.", "YTA. Saying her only connection to the child or incentive to care for them is money is grossly misinformed and frankly offensive. I have been a nanny for 20 years. You clearly have no idea how much some nannies put up with from the parents out of love and attachment for our children. It is excruciating to leave our children when they no longer need us. And it\u2019s not all about the money- my first family had 5 kids and paid me $8/hour in a very HCOL city. Even 20 years ago that was far below the going rate.", "YTA, and to be clear you\u2019re not discriminating against a kid. You\u2019re discriminating against the nanny.\n\nNot saying there is necessarily anything malicious or corrupt, but (young or not) the nanny is a professional. And while the \u201conly incentive\u201d may appear to be money, many nannies can become part of a family in many senses of the word. They may vacation with the family and care for the children in a way that is plenty responsible.", "It is, in fact, possible to have good intentions for your kid and still qualify for an YTA.\n\nCut back on that before you become a helicopter parent.", "YTA. You're judging this girl for her job and making up scenarios in your head about her being a kidnapper?", "YTA. These people have entrusted their child to this person\u2019s care. But you can\u2019t for what reason again?", "YTA. Do you vet the personal lives of the other parents? You know them through school, how trust worthy are they? How trustworthy are all of the other people your child encounters throughout the day. Surely you have read the headlines, there are not good people in every area of life.\n\nAnd yes, you have killed that friendship for your son. I wonder how many more there will be that don't meet your strict criteria.", "YTA. As a professional nanny she is probably more qualified to watch children than most of the parents you know. She\u2019s less likely to have strangers or random family members around being that it\u2019s not her home.  She\u2019s probably undertaken a criminal record check, and been trained in childhood first aid and CPR.", "YTA. Why do you need to know her personal life? Do you delve into the personal lives of the parents of your son\u2019s friends? Teachers? What does her personal life have to do with anything? \n\nAnd of course money is her number one concern. This will come as a shock to you, but it\u2019s the number one concern of people in any profession. Imagine that.", "YTA. Apart from the general inanity that I hope other commenters will point out: How common do you think random kidnapping is?", "YTA. Any random person that has sex can have a child; a nanny is a childcare professional with safety and care certifications. I'm sure you don't know every parent you're close with as well as you think you do - and regardless, this is indeed excessive.", "You really have to ask with that title? **Discriminating against a kid**. For having a different family and childcare situation. Anyone of any age can be responsible or irresponsible, so to assume the nanny can't be competent because she happens to be younger is pretty rude, yes. She's paid to know how to do what she's doing, and paid to know more about emergencies than parents typically do. YTA.", "YTA\n\nThis is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve read (at least today). Do you trust your son\u2019s teacher? Because he\u2019s with that person all day and presumably fine. Most of people do jobs because they need income, and this nanny\u2014because you say nanny and not babysitter\u2014most likely has some kind of knowledge of children. I\u2019m sure the other child\u2019s parents did a background check. \n\nAnd do you realize that people who work need money? Or is that below you somehow?", "YTA\n\nI read the post and some of your comments, you come off as very creepy and overbearing. If I was the nanny, I wouldn't want to talk with you either.\n\n You and your child is not the only people in the world, and while it's ok to worry for your son's safety, the nanny needs to feel safe as well. And the parents that hired the nanny feels it's safe to leave their child with her, so if you just don't trust the nanny because she's young and have no children of her own, you should trust the parents that hired her.", "YTA.\n\nYou did imply the other parents were less than by saying you would not leave your kid with the nanny they always leave their kids with. You're saying you don't respect their judgement.\n\nNothing prevents you from interviewing the nanny to get the same facts you must have about the neighbors except your judgement about nannies, in general.", "YTA. You don't seem to have put in any effort to know the nanny, who the parents have deemed responsible enough to help raise their child. A lot of nannies also take more first aid and child development classes than a parent ever will. I've known lots of education majors who nanny through school to pay their way to become teachers.", "YTA. I mean, it\u2019s your kid and your decision, but in my opinion it\u2019s an unreasonable one. You could have a chat with the nanny and get to know her a bit. Get to know her full name and where she\u2019s from, who to contact about her if your kid goes missing. Anything else you could know about another kid\u2019s parent really. \n\nA lot of young people\u2019s first job is some kind of childcare, it\u2019s really not that unusual. Nannies, daycare workers, camp counselors, etc., are often (but not always) young. It is doing your child a disservice socially for this to be the reason he can\u2019t keep this friend. This isn\u2019t that huge of a deal and he\u2019s young, but if you continue to be this overprotective and shelter him this much in other areas of his life as he grows up too, he will eventually resent you.", "YTA - Land the helicopter mom!  \n\nShe is trained enough that the parents trust her with their child.  For you to need to know her background and such does ASSUME and SUGGEST that they are negligent.", "YTA. I get the dad's response 100%. You don't have to have children to care for a child. I feel sorry for your kid growing up. You will cause your child to be isolated because his dad acts crazy. You say a school and teachers are okay because it's a controlled environment? Teachers can also do unspeakable things. Risk is a part of life.", "Gently, **YTA**\n\nI really wanted to say N-A-H, and that you have a right to not leave your child with anyone if they make you uncomfortable, but the truth is that the reasons you've given really don't stand up. And the fact that the other child's dad brought up racism (and a difference in your race and what seems to be either the nanny's or the other child's family's is something you somehow conveniently neglect to even mention despite this being the ONLY place you somehow don't feel \"comfortable\" leaving your child without you supervising) makes me super squidgy about the entire situation. \n\nMostly, though, your arguments just come across as thin and really questionable:\n\n>She is only nineteen, and I am not confident in her ability to appropriately respond to an emergency. \n\nI'm sorry, this has me really confused. At 19 a person can literally join the military and fight for their country, vote in an election, has been able to drive for several years (including to the hospital if necessary). This is university aged. It's certainly more than old enough to assess the vast majority of household injuries or minor illnesses, put a bandaid on something, stop minor bleeding . . . and if it were anything more serious than that then, given that she is a hired caregiver, her job would literally be to CALL YOU, HER EMPLOYERS, AND/OR AN AMBULANCE. Exactly how old do you think a person needs to be to do those things, if not nearly-20 years old? Furthermore, I've never met a professional nanny who didn't have up-to-date First Aid and child CPR certificates, which is actually MORE than most parents of young children that I know.\n\n>I don't know anything about her personal life, and don't feel it is appropriate to ask. Her only connection to the children or incentive to care for them is money.\n\nI mean, the same is literally true of your child's schoolteacher, but you leave him with her all day, every day. And you're right, it's not appropriate to ask about her personal life, because it's not only none of your business, it's irrelevant. Taking care of children and keeping them safe is this nanny's job. What she does outside of work hours doesn't really matter as long as it doesn't affect what she does DURING work hours. \n\nBut here's the thing: odds are you also don't know the finer details of the personal lives and habits behind closed doors of most of the parents of children your son has playdates with, who are supervising him when you're not there, except for the few who might be close friends of yours.So I have to wonder why the double standard?  Because frankly, I'd trust the woman who is PAID to keep my kid safe along with her usual charge a lot more than some parents who have no real vested interest other than social expectation, LOL.\n\nIn the end, you don't HAVE to leave your kid anywhere, but this isn't \"Do I Have Do?\" it's \"Am I The Asshole?\" And based on your reasoning here . . . yeah, YTA.", "YTA.\n\nLike, the teachers are also being paid, but you probably let your kid go to school without you supervising all day.", "YTA for blanket discrimination. She's a professional nanny. For all you know, you missed out on the most qualified person to keep an eye on your kid outside of school. She's most likely CPR certified and could have early childhood classes under her belt while going to school to be a teacher. You never took the time to ask anything about her. If you were so concerned about her qualifications, you should have asked. Obviously the parents who hired her did and felt like she was the best option to provide care for their child.", "apparently this sub things discrimination is okay   but not me YTA", "YTA majorly. I am a nanny and I LOVE the children I care for, it\u2019s not just about the money. Also, lots of nanny\u2019s have degrees (I have a CDA and elementary education degrees). Does this make me incompetent to watch a child simply because I\u2019m not a parent? Newsflash, all you have to do to he a parents is have sex and pop a kid out, and not every parent can be trusted with other people\u2019s children or even their own.", "YTA - ummm pretty sure the nanny has had some child care training and got a background check done.", "YTA. Apparently the nanny is not white. That seems to be the problem you have", "After reading the post and your comments you sound overbearing and nosy.  Ultimately it\u2019s your kid so do what you want, but you\u2019ll have to be ok with the fact your kid may lose friends or eventually resent you for being this way.", "Gonna go YTA. Unlike others, I think it\u2019s actually fair if you don\u2019t want your son to be left with a 19 year old. If you want to make a rule that your son can only have a play date if parents are home, that\u2019s fine. \n\nHowever, the correct response is to host your son and his friend at your home or coordinate with his friend\u2019s parents rather than try to pry into the details of the nanny.", "YTA.  \n\nI didn't leave my kid with others until I was confident of the others as well.  But I didn't discriminate between kids being with dad, mom or nanny.  If I didn't have an obvious interaction opportunity with the nanny I talked to the parents about the nanny in a casual, get to know them kind of way.  Not an intrusive how qualified are they way or are they a kid thief way.", "NTA, as your child's safety is your concern and you shouldn't leave them with anyone you don't trust.\n\nBut I think you're being unfair on the nanny assuming that her only motivation is financial. You should get to know her the same way you would with a parent and make a decision on that basis. \n\nAside: your comment on race threw me a bit and use of the word 'discriminating' in the title. What's that about?", "You lost me at knowing where the other people are from. I\u2019m thinking dad was onto something when he called you a racist.", "I guess its your kid and your rules.  But they seem odd.  You can ask the nanny her name, and try and get to know her (you know, treat her like a person).  I'm going with NAH.  Dad throwing out \"racist\" raises some flags for me....that's not typically something thrown in out of nowhere.\n\nAlso:  \"I know where they are from and the names of their siblings. If they snatched my kid I could say \"try looking in X town, contact these people.\" - you don't think someone snatching a kid might use fake names?  or give a fake backstory?", "YTA: I was a paid nanny and the parents turned out to be shthds and I ended up quitting and I still will answer the kid if they message me. We care about the kids just as much as the money if not, obviously more. Some are bag eggs. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for wanting to know the person you\u2019re leaving your kids with, but are the asshole assuming she doesn\u2019t care about the kids, that the parents haven\u2019t vetted her properly, and \u201cdiscriminating against a kid\u201d who has no say or\nAnything", "YTA - I started babysitting at 14 and became a paid live-in nanny when I was 19. Just because she is 19 doesn't make her irresponsible. Do you need to call CPS on these parents for endangering their child? I get wanting to get to know the nanny, even wanting to hang for a visit once just to keep an eye. Anything else is overprotective and weird.\n\nOh FFS, I didn't realize you are the dad not the mom.

It's up to you who you trust your children with.\n2. Your desire to know home towns and sibling names for your kid's friends' parents is very strange. My kids have had a number of close friends, and had lots of sleepovers with them. I don't think I know the names of any of their parents' siblings.\n3.

It\u2019s an appropriate work-related question.\n\nIf you want to know personal information such as where she lives, how long she has lived there, if she has a boyfriend then it\u2019s invasive and creepy and will probably put her on high alert that you may be a predator.", "No matter how many times you explain yourself it is clear to every person who reads this thread that you could've handled this better by just reaching out to the parents originally. Instead, you decided to just hang out unwanted for however many playdates while this nanny was trying to do her job. \n\nSay you just got concerned for your kid, which there is nothing wrong with, and ask for the name of the agency or something to get some peace of mind.", "He's in the first grade. He has one teacher.\n\nI'm not going to be fine with a stranger. I don't trust her.", "What's your logic exactly? You can't know anyone completely, so just leave your kid with anyone? Really?", "Knowing people is creepy?", "OP is definitely a narcissist who thinking anything he does and say is the gospel and throws a tanutrum when they dont agree with him or do things \"his way\". Like this is a subreddit about wondering if youre the asshole... and hes mad that people are calling him an asshole. Its not even worth the headache with this one hes a loss cause.", "What is your problem? Why are you so rude? My son is six years old. We spend every holiday together, obviously.", "His kid, his call. Parents have to trust their judgement and gut feelings. Maybe he trusts the parents enough to supervise his kid themselves - presumably he knows they have an established life in the same town, they probably have shared friends or acquaintances, it feels safe. But he might not trust their judgement on who they employ to care for their child.", "But he wasn't a southeast Asian, and everyone believed he was, which was the point. And we absolutely are less than 1%. There was a, as some might say, great conflagration. You assume much. There are many different types of people in the world besides the ones you know about.", "Need isn't the word. I don't need to know anything about her. She is a stranger. But I'm not leaving my kid with a stranger. If I knew more about her, she wouldn't be a stranger, but that isn't a need. I don't need to leave my kid with her."]}
