My husband (23M) stays home with our 3 year old son and also does an online school. \nA rundown of my day. I got up at 6:30am to get ready, son woke up at 7, so I got him his cup of milk and he stayed with me for a bit while I got ready. I then set him up with a show and woke his dad up at 8:30 when I left for work. I worked from 9am-12, attended a zoom class until 1:30pm. Worked until 4:30pm and got home at 5. My husband had a final exam to take, so I immediately left the house with my son. We went to my mom\u2019s, where I worked a second job from home. \nWhile my mom was watching my son, he still often comes to me to talk, get help with things, sit on my lap, etc. So it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m fully disconnected from him.  \nMy husband had 4 hours for his exam. Before I left I asked him to put pjs in the diaper bag and to wash the carseat when the neighbor brought it back. (He lent our $600 car seat to a neighbor we barely know. I don\u2019t agree with that choice for several reasons) He didn\u2019t put the pjs in the diaper bag. \nAfter we left I asked him to text me when he finished so we could come home. He didn\u2019t text me until 10:30pm that he was done. So we didn\u2019t get home until 11:30pm, well after our son\u2019s bed time. \nAs I pulled in the garage, the car seat I asked my husband to wash was just sitting there. I pointed to it and he flipped me off. I asked him to be nice as I was exhausted from work and school, to which his response was \u201cpussy\u201d. That I\u2019m not even in full time school and it\u2019s not that hard. (He has worked in the past but never full time work and school. The one time he did a full time summer internship he moved out of the state and left my son and me here. So his only responsibility was work) \nI lost it. I yelled and cried. Only to find out that he really finished his exam at 8:30 and said he didn\u2019t see my text, but then also said he was on the phone with his sister. (So he definitely saw the message) He also let me know that he signed us up to watch her kids tomorrow. \nI finally got the baby to bed, it\u2019s after midnight and I just finished cleaning up the house (because he doesn\u2019t pick up toys, do the dishes or any type of cleaning during the day because \u201cit\u2019s too hard to watch the baby and do other things\u201d) \nHe\u2019s saying I\u2019m the ass and I need to apologize or he\u2019s leaving. \n\nIt\u2019s not an issue of when the car seat is going to be clean, the issue is that I had to ask more than once. Same with the PJs, I asked multiple times and it still didn\u2019t happen.\n\nEdit: seems I should\u2019ve made it more clear. I worked my first job from 9-4:30. I had to take an hour off in the middle for a zoom class but resumed working right after. I will go in early tomorrow and stay late to hit my 40 hours this week. \nI worked my second job from 5:30pm-11pm.", "created_utc": 1695968114, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16v3tde/aita_for_losing_it_when_my_husband_called_me_a/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
