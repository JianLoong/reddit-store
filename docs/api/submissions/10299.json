Essentially it's tacked on or stuck with double-sided tape aligned with grids of painters tape rather than wallpaper paste. Might be a good compromise. \nAnother one is to enforce that if he wants that, he will be responsible for the painting both to black and from black when he moves out/ you move house (whichever is first). The effort of application might be enough to deter him or might teach him a new skill and might reduce the likelihood of picking it off (after all, he's the one who did all that work on it)\n\nA fun thing a friend did when I was in HS was use chalkboard paint rather than regular black. She got to be artsy, got to change up her decor etc, and ultimately it didn't end up being dark and sad like her family was concerned it would be by going full black. Is this an option?", "NTA. Because he didn't respect it last time. Maybe you can make a deal that he has to paint it over when you leave. I wanted black walls at that age. My Mum said no. To this day, I still regret it.

But that assumes your child is willing to compromise at all. In the end it's your house and since you're planning to move soonish I can totally see why you don't want to have to paint 2x. I also get your kids point of view. It's their space and they have every right to want it a certain way but this doesn't sound like a logical choice considering the circumstances.", "NTA.

A bit of N T A if they're being difficult about it but they're 14, being difficult is part and parcel of being a teenager. \n\nWhat my parents did when I was your kid's age, was paint my walls a dark red for me when I requested it because it was the first time I wanted it painted. In a few years when I regretted the dark red and asked for the room to be repainted, I was told I could do it myself with my own money (gift money or get a job where I could) and all my parents would contribute was moving the heavy furniture out of the way. My parents wouldn't have to put in the money and work, and I would get my room colour... I picked to stick with the red. But that's an offer to consider extending to your kid, maybe.", "NTA. This is a case of \"my house, my rules\" being a reasonable response to black walls .  I doubt your kid really grasps how difficult covering black paint will be.  This is even wothout considering the prior history of damaging the walls.  I would telll the kid you will consider allowing it under certain conditions. One, they restore the exisiting walls to saleable condition on their dime and labor, or reimburse you for the costs and labor incurred in restoring them if you have already restored the walls, and they give you  a deposit equal the cost of having the walls restored from black prior to painting them black. Take tehm around to a few companies that do that type of work so they can learn the consequences of painting the walls black.", "NAH. I went through that stage as a teen. My dad let me do 2 walls in black and used wallpaper instead of paint, so it would be easier to get rid of. Maybe something like that as a compromise?", "Give them one black wall only.

I was also that child, and my parents and I reached a compromise. I had a sort of bright blue walls with all black accents. Black curtains, bedsheets, throw rug, ect. It honestly looked way cooler to 15 year old me than black walls would have. You can work with your kid to find a compromise that suits their (currently) dark soul, too. It may even work better and be fun\n\nMy younger sister ended up picking the same color, of course, but her room looked a ton brighter with mostly lighter colored accents. You actually couldn't tell the rooms were exactly the same color. It gave some flexibility as we grew older to tailor it to changing personalities.", "Black is very difficult to paint over.

The walls would be black, but it might prevent him from picking at the walls if he can draw on them instead.", "If you use a really good primer and good paint you can usually cover up the darker colors of paint on your walls.

I can't imagine doing black.", "I just looked a Flavor Paper and OMG he would love the smoked cedar! I sent him a link, thank you!", "Yes, there is a lot going on with the kid. LOL Therapy has been tried, we have appointments with Children's Hospital, we keep open communication with teachers, we're supportive parents. Being a teenager in 2023 is a nightmare for some.", "But honestly, if it were my kid, I think I would sit him down and talk about the cost of the black paint + the cost of covering it up and the labor it will take. Maybe ask him to pay for the black paint AND a deposit for painters to cover it a few years from now if he really wants black walls that badly. It\u2019s the same idea as wanting a very expensive toy or piece of technology. The things we really want in life can cost a lot of money, and might not be the things we want a few years from now. It\u2019s a great life lesson for his age.", "Painting over black walls is a nightmare.", "I tried when I was 14. I did one wall and it looked bad LOL", "No, we have yet to discuss alternatives.

I picked navy blue but it had to have a lighter color faux finish over it, which ended up being silver.

My parents said okay. I had black walls for 4-5 years and loved loved loved them, thought they were so cool, etc. My friends liked them and thought my parents were so cool for allowing it. \n\nI look back and it\u2019s just one more way my mom and dad showed me they cared about me. Pictures of my room from that time make me really happy because my dad helping me paint the walls of my room black was essentially him telling me he loved me. \n\nThe rule was I had to help paint it black, I had to help paint it back, and the outside of the door had to stay completely normal so they could shut the door and have the house still look the way they preferred it to look. \n\nMy dad had been dreading repainting it. He got high quality, good coverage paint and it took one coat of paint to repaint it. It is now a light, light, light blue with white trim.

Peelable wallpaper sounds like a genius solution if you can afford it.", "Oh, well, in that case.  No.  No special wall colors, no extra privileges.  Nothing in life is free.

A good primer is all you need to cover dark paint. Also, make your son do the painting. Both times. Unless you think he's too incompetent. But it's not that hard. I think painting the walls is a pretty harmless thing to let a kid do. It sounds like you have a lot of anxiety around this for some reason. Because painting a room is really not a big deal and your reasons for not wanting to do it are pretty thin. If you simply don't want to do the labor or pay for it, that's totally fair. I helped my mom paint my room when I was 10 years old. If your son does the work himself or at least helps, maybe he'll respect it more.
