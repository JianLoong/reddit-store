And of course the bride and her family is upset, it happens all the time when people don't want to go to weddings. Nobody else cares, especially, in this case, the groom.\n\n>And just because everyone else is skipping doesn't mean it's ok for him too. \n\nDoesn't mean it's not okay either.\n\n>Skipping out on commitments he's made, I'm talking about football practice here, is a huge pet peeve of mine. Shows a lot about his character. I remember starting a rugby team and having 20+ kids on the roster but only 13 showing up to games when we needed 15 to play. That fucking sucked. Him skipping out on practice is a slap in the face to his teammates.\n\nYeah skipping practice is a terrible habit, I said that. He made a commitment to his mom's wedding with the condition that his boyfriend could come. Welp mom said no boyfriend so that's commitment is void.", "So you think it\u2019s not a black tie event and the son will be the only person in a tuxedo?", "I haven't said any of that anywhere.  I have said nothing about kids expressing emotion. I have said nothing about kids not being happy or grateful. I said nothing about kids obeying every command. You are just making things up.\n\nI said sometimes kids need to do things they don't want to do. This doesn't mean that you control every aspect of their life. \n\nI wanted my daughter to play a sport. She didn't want to, ok fine.live your Iife I won't push it.\n\nI wanted my daughter to go the dentist and that was fight everytime. On that I stood my ground and a quick threat of no phone was all it took. That was a command that she needed to 'bow down or else'.\n\nYou live in some sort hyperbowl world where that means kids need to be robots. But hey, this is reddit, no room for nuance.\n\nThe mom's wedding is 'put your foot down' moment", "No it was not necessary. Reported.", "His boyfriend isn't coming because of his actions. He made a deal with his mom and didn't hold up his end. \n\nHe threw a tantrum and got everything he wanted. This kid is fucked.\n\nThe entire post is him getting rewarded for bad behavior.", "it\u2019s literally a wedding. don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been to one but i\u2019m sure he won\u2019t be the only person in a tuxedo. but it could definitely be a mixture of business casual and black tie. (most weddings i\u2019ve been too was a mixture, people wore what they wanted) still doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a black tie event."]}
