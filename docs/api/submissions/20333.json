You didn't restrict him from going, you merely let him decide and respected his decision.

NTA and maybe if she was marrying someone that he actually liked he'd have been more inclined to go.", "NTA:  The kid is 16. What did she expect you to physically drag him there and force him to go.", "NTA.  You didn't forbid him from going, you simply didn't make him do something he clearly didn't want to.\n\nAlso, I think that Derek looking for a child-free wedding that *excludes his bride-to-be's son* to be a huge red flag.  I'm guessing the dislike between Joshua and Derek is mutual.\n\nI think you did the right thing by backing your son on this, and not forcing him to attend.  16 is old enough for him to make that call on his own.  If your ex was so concerned about having Joshua there, she should have treated him better.  Essentially, she's just whining about having to face the consequences of her own actions.", "NTA. Your Son is old enough to decide if he wanted to go, or not. You did right thing by not forcing him to go and supporting him, especially if it could result in him acting out.", "NTA\n\nYour ex is the one who made y'alls son uncomfortable. You aren't liable for her actions, and to an extent, you aren't liable for her relationship with your son. Supporting your son is the right move.", "NTA how would you even make a 16 yo go? If she wanted him there she prolly should have taken his feelings and needs into account and taken his bf", "NTA - your son is surely old enough to have some say in where he goes in his free time. He doesn't want to go to an event, he's vocal about not wanting to go. I imagine that \"forcing\" him to go would only have resulted in him acting out further and thereby causing your ex and her hew bloke to complain about his behaviour.\n\nI can appreciate how your ex feels, because obviously she was hoping that he would be there and was disappointed that the reality didn't match whatever picture she had in her mind about how the day would go, but I'm guessing this would really be the better of two scenarios, the alternate being him sulking about having to be somewhere he didn't want to be / potential confrontational issues between him and \"Derek\" so really she should focus on what she has rather than mourning a lost fantasy.\n\nI think you honestly did the right thing buy not forcing the issue and just respecting your son to make his own decision", "NTA\n\nSure perhaps if they get a better relationship down the road he might regret it but seriously, he\u2019s 16 and his mom is not okay with him bringing his boyfriend ? If someone\u2019s the AH she is.", "NTA\n\nSounds like your ex is trying to play the victim by lying to her family and telling them that you actively prevented Joshua from going to the wedding.  She knows that if she tells the truth and admits that Joshua didn't want to be there, they'd want to know why and judge her for prioritizing her and Derek's happiness over her son's.", "Nta. He\u2019s 16 and didn\u2019t want to go. Don\u2019t blame him at all. \nI\u2019ll never understand why so many adults expect kids to just get over all the trauma they\u2019ve caused their kids to endure because of their own unwise decisions and now they want a new future for themselves and the kids just magically need to get on board happily like performing robots, as if the kids don\u2019t have a right to feel the way they feel and heal at their own pace. If she was a good mom she\u2019d get it wasn\u2019t about her needs even for her wedding (who demands this from a minor child still reeling and in pain from a relatively fresh divorce?) . Her wants don\u2019t come before her minor child\u2019s needs. I\u2019m glad your son has one understanding parent.", "NTA - You didn't force him to not go , you respect what he wants , he is old enough to decide that \nThe mom and the others sucks", "So your ex married a man who wants nothing to do with your son and didn't want him at the wedding, so in the end he got what he wanted. You're ex in-laws can mind their own business. Good for you for protecting your son. NTA", "NTA. You sound like a really good parent. If Joshua is up to it, see if you can get him into therapy. It\u2019ll be easier for him to address his feelings about his mom now. \n\nYour ex and her family care about the aesthetic of the event more than how he feels.", "NTA and for the following reasons:\n-Your son is dealing with emotions from coming out and being and teen and your ex is trying to push him to his limits.\n-Your son is old enough to say no which is a very short full sentence used world wide.\n-There is a reason why your son hates your wife which either we as well as op missed or he did not clarify.", "NTA. The simple fact that she's marrying someone who thought about making the wedding childfree even for the bride's kid says it all. Your business is not about accomplishing your ex wife but about protecting your son. This may cause some rift in the mother-son relationship, but can also be the kind of alert for her to start behaving if she doesn't want to lose her son", "ESH\n\nDerek for insisting on having a child-free wedding when he's marrying *a mother.*\n\nEx for agreeing to have a mostly-child-free wedding, saying Joshua could bring his bf and then banning him as a punishment, and insisting Joshua comes when he very obviously doesn't want to.\n\nEx-in-laws for calling you because what you do is no longer their business at all.\n\nJoshua for acting about 10 years younger than he is (its a wedding, of course he's supposed to wear a tux/suit. Tf did he expect?).\n\nYou for not even trying to communicate to ex that you're not going to force Joshua to go in the week leading up to the wedding and seemingly not trying to get to the bottom of *why* he doesn't want to go.\n\nLike yeah Joshua didn't want to go to the wedding because him and Derek clearly hate each other, but as a parent I'd want to know exactly how their interactions actually play out. Do they just not click, or is Derek mistreating him somehow? It's a big red flag for your new spouse-to-be to not get along with your child in my opinion, and the fact that no one seems all that concerned about it is worrying.", "Co parenting is difficult. In this situation it feels like all the adults are the AH. It seems like you give him a lot of outs based on your comments about his clothing and ignoring his mom. It also sounds like you may have some bitterness towards your ex based on the comment about how quickly she moved on. She should have been more understanding of the tux situation and you should have been more supportive of her getting married. Based on what you've said, I get the impression you are both using your child in ways that are emotionally inappropriate. Look outside yourself. There may come a day that he regrets not going to his mother's wedding, he's still a child after all and acts out emotionally like we all do at some point, especially in our teens.", "ESH you all are acting immature.", "NTA, you are a good dad.", "INFO: did she come get him?", "sounds like it was your gay son that ruined his moms wedding, you didn't stop him from attending he threw a tantrum and refused to go, thats between his mom and him dont let people blame you, its not your place to force him to go to a wedding he doesnt want to be at, could you imagine what would happen if he did go, he would throw a bigger tamtrum and really ruin the wedding - but in your exes mind somehow that would be your fault too for forcing him to go", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
