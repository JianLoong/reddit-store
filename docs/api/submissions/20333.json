Different families have different agreements. In some families the step parent is expected to quite literally step up as a secondary or even replacement parent to the original ones. But in others they're quite simply the parent's new partner and are expected to have no hand in parenting or raising the child. \n\nYou can't assume what the agreement is. It's entirely possible (and actually likely considering Joshua's dislike for Derek) that Derek has been asked to be nothing more than the ex's partner and so Joshua is jot his priority and Joshua's issues are not Derek's to get involved in. \n\n>If things were that bad, I\u2019d say let\u2019s put this wedding on hold and see what we can do to help the kid who is PLAINLY STRUGGLING.

This is actually OP and the ex's problem to figure out, not Derek's. The best Derek can do is say \"Aren't you guys going to do something about this?\" and if OP and the ex say no then there's nothing Derek can do about it. His parents obviously aren't getting Joshua help. So the best Derek can do is say no kids and no Joshua unless he can behave, since Derek did relent to Joshua being invited in the end. \n\nHis only other option is to wait until Joshua hits 18 and his parents can no longer force him to get help and then carry on because he'll truly have 0 obligations or need to take Joshua into consideration.\n\nI don't know why you're blaming Derek when it's the parents that dropped the ball. Joshua isn't Derek's problem. \n\nHe's not Derek's kid, Derek doesn't have any parental relationship or responsibilities, Derek wasn't keen on Joshua coming but relented (considering the mother invited Joshua and Joshua's bf if he could behave).\n\nThere's literally nothing more Derek can do besides calling off the wedding indefinitely or straight up leaving, and that's not Derek's job to sacrifice his own stuff for Joshua's sake.", "Depends on the couple and their reasoning.

Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019ve made it exceedingly clear that you don\u2019t give a sh*t about how they feel or what they need, yet demand that they bow down to you.

That is ridiculous.  \n\nKeep in mind, again, that Derek isn\u2019t just passing through.  As mom\u2019s new husband, he\u2019s possibly going to be around for a while.

I mean how often does mom (and or her bf) steamroll the kid? And what did she think would happen. The only reason the kid was willing to go is because his bf would go. Who would want to go to a wedding they don't approve of without a date regardless of age?", "I'm was the child of divorced parents with a step father of my own. I was the child that had to navigate his parents' divorce. I used to have a strained relationship with both him and my mum before we patched things up. You don't know me, so don't assume. \n\nIf I was acting out since my step dad met me until the day they got married, I wouldn't expect him to be too fond of me either. \n\n>it\u2019s the parent who is intent on moving full-steam ahead into a marriage with a partner who did not want her own child at the wedding. That is ridiculous. \n\nIt's not like Derek didn't have a reason to be uncomfortable with Joshua coming. This is not some gender swapped cinderalla story with an evil stepfather.

This isn't a simple thing like Joshua not being as close to Derek as Derek and the mum had hoped. This is a big problem where the kid has issues and they're not getting sorted out. And as a stepparent it is not Derek's place to get involved, as he has no legal right or permission from the parents to get involved. Derek shouldn't have to pause his life until Joshua gets sorted out or he passes some arbitrary age at which you decide he's responsible for his issues. \n\nDerek is likely a long term or even permanent part of the family, but that doesn't mean he should have his wedding ruined by a Joshua that decides that not only does he dislike the dress code but he dislikes the food as well.", "In what world do you show up to a wedding in sweatpants as a guest?

There are plainly issues here, perhaps in multiple directions, and they should be resolved in a compassionate way. \n\nPut simply, I do not think it\u2019s a reasonable state of affairs to basically say, \u201cWell, Joshua has been acting out so he\u2019s a problem and of course he shouldn\u2019t go to his own parent\u2019s wedding.\u201d  Kids act out when they need help.

What Derek apparently wants\u2014a marriage to the mother\u2014seems to be at odds with what may be in Joshua\u2019s best interests right now.

It looks like he's struggling with his parents' divorce and with his mother moving on. It doesn't seem to be an objection to Derek personally but to the fact that his mum is marrying anyone other than his dad.\n\nIt's been 2 years since the divorce, Joshua is 16 and has a romantic life of his own.

But for a situation like this where he's upset mum and dad aren't together, I don't think acting out it is acceptable.

And Joshua is at the age where he can start learning that how he treats others and how he behaves will affect his relationships and how involved he's able to he in other people's big life events. He only has himself to blame if he later regrets not going or not being able to go as a result of his own actions.\n\nIn the end Derek even relented to inviting Joshua andit was Joshua that chose not to go.

Ignore her. \n\nNTA", "NTA\nThe kid clearly isn't ready for her to get remarried\nIt's a big adjustment. but it's not your fault he didn't want to go", "NTA, he's 16, he can choose. \n\nThat being said, you need to nip this whole refusing to wear a suit thing in the bud. Kid can't wear sweats forever.", "You're doing a good job being a calm and stable influence in Joshua's life.\n\nKeep up the good work!\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Tell your ex in-laws to shush. It was your sons decision. Would it be upsetting to be in her position, yeah, but if this has been going on for roughly two years and he doesn\u2019t get on with her husband, she\u2019s had ample time to try and work on their relationship and find out how to help Joshua. \n\nNot to mention that knowing his mum had to argue to be able to invite him must be an awful feeling. I don\u2019t understand how she could marry someone that tried to stop her son from being invited to her own wedding. It\u2019s not surprising he doesn\u2019t want to be at his Mums house or her wedding. Her choices have consequences.", "NTA- In the HUGEST way. What your son needs is someone who is unequivocally on his side, right now more than ever. You showed him what a real adult looks like, listening, understanding, being strong enough to stand up for people who deserve it.", "NTA. If you have texts, emails, or voice mails of your ex's and her fianc\u00e9's behavior, I encourage you to share then with your ex inlaws to show that there is a very understandably and logical reason why your son did not attend - he did not want to as he knew he would not be welcome.", "NTA, your son and his mother need family therapy. Your son is blessed he has you in his corner.", "NTA\n\nI really feel bad for your son.", "NTA. \"Not letting her have her son there\", like he's some trophy she gets to trot out for display whenever she likes rather than his own person with his own feelings who deserves the final say in whether he goes or not. Good on you for standing up for your son.", "NTA if he was throwing a tantrum while tux shopping and crying and screaming not to go the day of, what did they actually and realistically think he was gonna do at the wedding?", "I know i\u2019m late to the party here but I just wanted to piggyback off your comment and add that OP seems like a really good dad for listening to his son and not forcing him to do something he didn\u2019t want to do. I would look into getting full custody if that\u2019s something Joshua would be interested in.", "Everyone does share some of the blame, but it's certainly not equal. \n\nMom and Derek flat out suck.\n\nDad and Josh are just immature.", "How are we so sure that there are no consequences for Joshua at all? It\u2019s irrelevant to the story. You read \u201ccutting classes\u201d and became all judgmental on OP\u2019s parenting style altogether (\u201cyou need to be a parent and not just a friend\u201d is a bold statement and pure speculation) even though 1) that was far from the AITA topic, and 2) you have no idea on whether he actually did anything. He might have, he just didn\u2019t think forcing the boy to go to his mom\u2019s wedding without his boyfriend is the way to go. Get off your \u201cformer school board\u201d high horse and stay within the topic.", "Who TF would invite their son to their wedding *as a guest???* They're assholes for that alone.\n\nNot to mention Derek not even wanting to invite his soon-to-be-stepson to begin with.", "That's fine, but refusing to communicate with his ex or even let her know of her son's decision for a week before her wedding was not necessary to protect Josh and is just a total dick move.\n\nIt's great that OP supports his son. It's not necessary to join in with him pissing off his mum; OP's job as a parent is also to help Josh navigate that relationship and model reasonable behaviour. He's doing great at the biggest part but failing elsewhere.", "He could have gone to support his mom!! He doesn't have to care about the idiot husband. ESH who marries someone who doesn't want your kid at their wedding and who allows a teenager to just make a decision like that! Did he even ask him or talk to him about why he didn't want to go it was just an ok and since she screamed at me. OP allowed that out of spite", "When you marry someone with a kid you also sign up as a step parent, if you don't want them at your wedding that's a good sign there shouldn't be a wedding in the first place.", "\u201cJosh wasn\u2019t an asshole deliberately\u201d.\n\nI guess that\u2019s my point.  You can be justified in your actions but still an A H.  \n\nI used to be on an elementary school board and skipping school - even a day - has such negative correlations with academic achievement.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure about \u201cmost teenagers\u201d.  I\u2019ve got 3 of them and maybe we are lucky but I don\u2019t know any of them or their extended friendship groups that has cut class.  Granted I live in a area of relative socioeconomic advantage and their schools reflect that.", "\u201cAllow a teenager to just make a decision like that\u201d? I dunno, someone who respects their nearly adult son\u2019s autonomy?", "Why? she doesn\u2019t support him. She\u2019s pissed because of how it looked to other people that her son wasn\u2019t there.", "I should have been more clear. Josh wasn't an asshole he was suffering and did not know how to express it. It's part of growing. A two year old is not an asshole because he is biting people, he is biting people because nobody has figured out he's teething yet and needs help.  Josh's dad worked it out with him.\n\nIt's nice that your kids grew up happy and healthy. I'm guessing you'd say they were still perfectly behaved even if they had a mom like op's ex? I find that hard to believe, but maybe a miracle can happen some times. Be happy for your kids. show sympathy for other kids that are not that lucky.", "NTA\n\nYou defended your child and stood by him. Maybe he should have worn a tux this one time but from the fact that his mom made his +1 conditional, it sounds like she was making it difficult for him leading up to this.", "Let's see if I understood, Joshua is behaving like all adolescents, being dramatic and something of an idiot and mom does not handle it well and I exaggerate in her reaction, what does that have to do with OP? NTA because this has nothing to do with you", "NTA. \n\nYou're being a good dad, at least someone is listening to your son.", "\u2026yes? I mean, that\u2019s a perfectly healthy and natural reaction to somebody going against something you want, no? /s", "Nice well said.   i like your outrage .", "I mean, if that's the dress code, that's the dress code. Or maybe it's the dress code for the close family who's included in the wedding party and head table. Just because you haven't been to a tux wedding doesn't mean they don't exist. \n\nI haven't either, but I've got an invite to one this year where my husband will have to rent a tux. (I'm staying home with the dog, as it's in a different country and his family so he'll have to represent us both. So I won't have to find a ball gown, thankfully. If I had been able to go though, it would have been fun dressing up and being all fancy for a night.)", "NTA your ex ruined her own wedding by being such a hard case and not taking her son\u2019s thoughts, opinions, or feelings into account at any point.  Your former in-laws raised a real winner, the type who can\u2019t see past her own nose.", "NTA", "nta", "INFO : which counselling joshua received since the divorce ?", "Mom is making amazing life choices throughout.\n\nThat poor boy. We're glad OP that you have his back.\n\nNTA.", "You sound like a dork", "You\u2019re not fooling anyone Derek.", "I'm not sure he did.  The kid would probably been happy to wear neat casual in a comfortable style.\n\nI got the sense he was just clarifying that the kid generally just wears the most comfortable clothes to highlight the difference between the extremely formal tux and his ordinary clothes.\n\nKid was just a guest.  He wasn't part of the wedding party.  No where was it mentioned it was a black tie affair."]}
