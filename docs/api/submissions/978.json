When my partner and I told my brother we were dating he was happy. He was happy that his best friend and his favourite sibling were together. But when we told him we got engaged, things changed. He became sour and didn\u2019t even congratulate us. Throughout the entire wedding planning process, he made negative comments about everything and kept making 'jokes' about what a terrible wife I\u2019ll be and that my partner should run while he can. My family and my partner all acted as if he was just joking. \n\nWhen we were three weeks out from my wedding, my brother asked me to come over to his place by myself. When I got there he told me I needed to cancel the wedding. He kept saying he can't tell me why I just need to cancel it. I was getting worried, maybe he knew something about my fianc\u00e9, maybe he was protecting me. But he denied it, he said my fianc\u00e9 is great but I need to cancel it. As a joke, I said it sounds like you're in love with him and admitted that he is. I was taken aback and didn't know what to say. So I told him he was uninvited from the wedding and left. \n\nWhen my family and my fianc\u00e9s family found out I uninvited him he told them it was because he insulted me. So everyone thought I was just being dramatic and I'll get over it. It\u2019s now a week away from the wedding and my fianc\u00e9 keeps telling me to call my brother and sort it out. He says it\u2019s now getting ridiculous and he needs his best man. My family is calling me immature and keeps telling me to get over it. Even though they don\u2019t know the full story. I\u2019m so conflicted. I would never get with someone my siblings have romantic feelings for but now it\u2019s too late. I love my fianc\u00e9, we have a life together and we are planning our future. I can't just cancel it all. I\u2019m also not going to out my brother to everyone, I\u2019m not a horrible person.

But you need to have a sit-down with your brother to work this out, and hopefully for him to attend this occasion.

Tell him you're sorry but you're engaged and it's too late to just undo everything, and remind him that his romantic interest does not share his feelings. I also think he should be coming clean to your fiance, because that should give him some closure. And I do think your husband-to-be needs to know what is really happening.\n\nI would suggest allowing him to go to the wedding. It's your fiance's best man, and it means a lot to him. If you clear the air and he's on his best behavior, great. And if he tries to pull anything, what is he going to do? He's not going to out himself in front of the entire family just to try to stop the wedding. And at that point, if he does try or say anything, then it's just going to reflect poorly on him. If he tries anything drastic to prevent the wedding after you try to reason with him, then that's when you should be taking drastic measures. \n\nAlso, try to avoid direct contact with your brother, give him some space (after one last attempt to resolve this). He's the asshole for how he has treated you and attempting to get you to end the wedding. This will also prevent him from pestering you behind closed doors, and surely your family is going to be far more understanding if he does/says anything in front of them.", "NTA because your brother has created an impossible situation for you. I also don't think you're an AH for uninviting him. If he's adamant that you cancel the wedding, how do you know he'll behave during the wedding and not try and sabotage it in some way.\n\nYour brother has forced your hand to make you need to maybe tell someone. I wholeheartedly agree that no-one should out anyone, but your brother hasn't been reasonable here - this isn't a normal situation. At the very least, start by telling your OH that your brother insisted that you cancel the wedding. That he went on and on about it. That might be enough to make your OH wonder if your brother should really be there. He might even reach out to your brother and insist on a reason. That could get your brother to back down and you won't have outed him. However, if your OH doesn't think there's any concern in your brother insisting you cancel the wedding, then you should tell your OH but swear him to secrecy. At least you will have one person on your side who understands why you did what you did, even if he ultimately says that your brother should be invited again. He could then confirm to your family that you had a good reason for uninviting him and that they should back off a bit. \n\nIf you don't do anything here, your family is going to think you're crazy or really unreasonable and that will be a terrible start to your future.\n\n*edited for typos.", "NTA \n\nAlthough, like others have said, you should tell your fianc\u00e9 that there was more to it than an insult and your brother is adamant about you not getting married.

It\u2019s truly a special day for both of you- you don\u2019t want to start it angry. He needs to know why his best friend isn\u2019t going to be there. \n\nCan your brother talk to him? Maybe calling your brother from fianc\u00e9\u2019s phone since he blocked you everywhere? Or at the very least facilitate or start a conversation with them face to face? \n\nI understand not outing your brother, but you need think about your marriage as well. So, you need to decide what you are going to do about the wedding? Postpone? Cancel (exactly what your brother wants?) \n\nAt the very least you need to tell your fianc\u00e9 and family that your brother wants you to cancel the wedding, and that they will have to check in with your brother as to why he wants this since he blocked you everywhere else (this is if you can\u2019t facilitate a conversation with your fianc\u00e9 and him beforehand). \n\nThis is tough OP! I\u2019m sorry you are going through this and that your brother put you in this situation. He had months to speak to your fianc\u00e9 and to you prior. He could have saved everyone the heartache- instead he wants you to cancel your life for a \u201cwhat if\u201d. Your fianc\u00e9 clearly doesn\u2019t reciprocate his feelings. \n\nAt the end of the day, you don\u2019t want to start your marriage on the wrong foot with your husband. The day is meant to celebrate your union. Your husband won\u2019t be able to help thinking \u201cmy best friend is missing my wedding\u201d, so it\u2019s a tough call, but I hope you and your brother can chat beforehand so that things can be resolved. \n\nGood luck Op!", ">Should I just let him come and be miserable at the wedding or should I continue to be the asshole to the rest of our family and keep him away?\n\ncan you handle him ruining your wedding? cos the possibility of him doing that is quite high. I won't even be surprise he gets drunk and turn his speech into a confession like in a romcom movie, which seems to me that sitting him down with at least your fianc\u00e9 to force him out of the closet to his best friend before the wedding is a must.\n\nSounds like you're damn if you do, damn if you don't.

I do agree with all the comments advising you should tell your fiance what happened.  And talk with your brother--his feelings are just that--his.  Unless he has a valid reason to think they are reciprocated (or every could be) then he just needs to deal with them in his own way and not ruin the lives of his best friend and favorite sibling by demanding you give up on each other.  If his friend isn't gay or bi, then nothing is accomplished except that 3 people are miserable instead of only 1.", "You need to be honest with your future spouse about the real reason why you uninvited your brother.

Please try to work it out with your brother and invite him to the wedding. You may regret it and it may harm your relationships with your family if you don't.

There is a possibility that he would out himself, mic drop, and the rest of the wedding is awkward af. Or, he could throw in some more of those jokes that he has been making and you'll be uncomfortable.\n\nAs a compromise, your brother can be allowed to attend as a guest only?\n\nAnother option is to continue to take all the crap your family AND fiance is giving you about why there is a rift with your brother and why he is uninvited.\n\nOr you let your fiance know that at the very least your brother seriously sat you down and tried to get you to cancel the wedding and is not supportive of the marriage and hope that is enough to get your fiance to completely back you up against all the attacks about you uninviting your brother.\n\nFinally, you tell your fiance the full truth and agree to keep it between the two of you and not out your brother to the rest of the family.\n\nAt some point, the truth will come out, maybe months or maybe years, but you need to make sure that you don't end up in a situation where your brother is saying \"OP stole him from me!

You clarified several times that it wasn't a joke. Eventually brother told you the reason for the request. You are upset at brother not only for the request but also for divulging his reason because it's not something you can ethically repeat. If fianc\u00e9 starts making guesses remain calm and say it is important to your values and you won't engage in any conversation about it.

You can't break your engagement and cancel the wedding because your feelings are reciprocated.

If he still insists on you cancelling... it's nice that you don't want to out him and are willing to take the blame, but your fianc\u00e9 deserves the truth.

You don't think your fianc\u00e9 deserves to know his best man tried to cancel his wedding and told you to dump him? Your fianc\u00e9 trusts someone who betrayed him and is trying to control him in an inappropriate possessive way, and you're hiding it showing no respect for your fianc\u00e9e either. Also, your fianc\u00e9 should get to decide how comfortable he still is doing things like getting dressed in front of your brother. \n\nI feel terrible for your fianc\u00e9. Neither his best friend or soon to be wife treat him with respect or are trustworthy. \n\nAs for the rest of your family, you stopped owing your brother silence once he lied to make you look bad.
