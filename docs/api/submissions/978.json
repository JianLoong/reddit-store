I was getting worried, maybe he knew something about my fianc\u00e9, maybe he was protecting me. But he denied it, he said my fianc\u00e9 is great but I need to cancel it.

If you clear the air and he's on his best behavior, great. And if he tries to pull anything, what is he going to do? He's not going to out himself in front of the entire family just to try to stop the wedding. And at that point, if he does try or say anything, then it's just going to reflect poorly on him. If he tries anything drastic to prevent the wedding after you try to reason with him, then that's when you should be taking drastic measures. \n\nAlso, try to avoid direct contact with your brother, give him some space (after one last attempt to resolve this).

I wholeheartedly agree that no-one should out anyone, but your brother hasn't been reasonable here - this isn't a normal situation. At the very least, start by telling your OH that your brother insisted that you cancel the wedding. That he went on and on about it. That might be enough to make your OH wonder if your brother should really be there. He might even reach out to your brother and insist on a reason. That could get your brother to back down and you won't have outed him. However, if your OH doesn't think there's any concern in your brother insisting you cancel the wedding, then you should tell your OH but swear him to secrecy. At least you will have one person on your side you understands why you did what you did, even if he ultimately says that your brother should be invited again.

I\u2019m sorry you are going through this and that your brother put you in this situation. He had months to speak to your fianc\u00e9 and to you prior.

I do agree with all the comments advising you should tell your fiance what happened.  And talk with your brother--his feelings are just that--his.  Unless he has a valid reason to think they are reciprocated (or every could be) then he just needs to deal with them in his own way and not ruin the lives of his best friend and favorite sibling by demanding you give up on each other.

Please try to work it out with your brother and invite him to the wedding. You may regret it and it may harm your relationships with your family if you don't.

Good luck.", "NTA \nBut you need to come clean to your fianc\u00e9 and asks how he feels, hopefully he doesn\u2019t have feelings for your brother too\nYou might need to tell your parents as well, they need to know you are not being petty, but instead that he is upset about the wedding himself, just let your brother know that you need to let them know.", "TELL THE TRUTH TO YOUR FIANCE!!!", "NTA. Tell your fiance. If he confronts your brother let them work out how it's going to play. Who knows maybe you'll get an art studio and a lifetime of yogurt.", "NTA but you NEED to tell your fianc\u00e9 what happened.", "Question. Did you think by uninviting him he would fall out of love with your fianc\u00e9?  What possible difference does it make if he goes?  clearly he\u2019s keeping everything a secret so there probably won\u2019t be a scene.  Just let the man come keep everything normal and that\u2019s much less stress. I\u2019ve been in love with many of my siblings, significant others he\u2019ll get over it", "NTA. Inform your fianc\u00e9 though, at the very least.", "You need to tell your fiancee.", "NTA but you need to out your brother to your fiancee. Don't you think he's going to end up last minute confessing to him to try and stop the wedding.", "NTA but these are legit issues you run into when you date your siblings best friend, like out of all the people in the world, why him? Obviously it's too late now but I don't know why people date they're siblings best friend knowing it will cause issues somewhere down the line", "You're NTA. It sounds like you're handling this with more grace than most people should have. You and your fianc\u00e9 need to talk to your brother together. You shouldn't out him to the whole family, but your fianc\u00e9 has a right to know. You don't wanna start this marriage with a secret like this.", "NTA\n\nPiggy ridding top comment.\n\nYou DO NOT need to out him, but YOU NEED to Tello your fianc\u00e9 that your brother told you to cancel the wedding because you should be marrying him.", "Of course!", "Came here to say exactly this. Your partner is your number 1 and you should be able to share the burden of knowledge with each other", "100% you guys need to be on the same page here BEFORE you get married", "No, it\u2019s not her place to do that. It\u2019s her brothers", "Disagree on the last part. She is in no position to out her brother, it's not a good idea. \nShe *should* talk to her brother and try to convince him to tell the fiance himself.", "Exactly what I said", "This is what I keep wondering. Something seems off.", "No no no. Marriage is not about blind trust it is about open communication. This is not the time for some relationship test. This is the time to have the difficult conversation.", "He gave up the right to that when he decided to be a dick. Just cuz he's being shitty from inside the closet (?) doesn't mean he gets a pass. OP should have told her fiance asap but shd also tell the rest of the family otherwise she looks like a jerk for no reason.", "I think he\u2019s trying to pressure you into calling it off because he knows you won\u2019t want to put him. Tell your fianc\u00e9", "Well, that\u2019s your ticket out.  You didn\u2019t uninvite your brother, he uninvited himself by telling you that he refuses to accept that you are moving ahead with the wedding AND proceeding to block you because he doesn\u2019t want to talk to you. This is NOT on you, it\u2019s on HIM. You don\u2019t have to out him to stick to the truth.  But also, screw what everyone else thinks. You\u2019re the one getting married, so the only people required to be there are you and your husband.", "He\u2019s about the be your husband. He outranks your brother.", "Your fianc\u00e9 comes first and he has a right to know why your brother is behaving this way. This isn\u2019t fair to your fianc\u00e9. How can you call yourself his partner when you don\u2019t trust him enough or care for him enough to tell him the truth? \n\nI would honestly be disgusted with my partner if I found out they kept something like that hidden from me because it effects your partner personally. If it was just \u201cmy brother is gay\u201d my opinion would be different but he has feelings for your partner and is actively trying to sabotage your partner\u2019s relationship because of it. How do you know your brother won\u2019t make up lies about you to his best friend? Your partner needs to be aware of the situation. \n\nDon\u2019t even bother getting married if you can\u2019t be bothered to put your spouse first here.", "It\u2019s not just you anymore it\u2019s you and fianc\u00e9. If you ever want to have an open (communication) relationship with your fianc\u00e9 you can\u2019t keep this a secret. This affects him and it wasn\u2019t fair of your brother to put you in this position. Maybe it\u2019s his way of telling his best friend without having to tell him.", "There are no secrets between spouses. But even more, this is a huge betrayal if you don\u2019t tell him.", "If you can't talk to your fiance about important matters, like this, then you should rethink the wedding. Hard conversations are hard, but they're necessary. Tell him you want to tell him something between just the 2 of you, and explain what happened. This involves him whether you like it or not and he deserves to know, your brother is his best friend so this is definitely not going away and you don't want to start your marriage on secrets that *will* come out eventually", "Because he doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on \n\nI can understand your apprehension but now you look like the crazy fianc\u00e9 who uninvited her own brother and his best man because of some silly little insult. \n\nThis man is about to spend the rest of his life with you. He should know.", "I get that outing someone is shitty and that\u2019s legitimate. But treating you the way he is and the lying to literally everyone about your conversation is just as shitty. He put you in a no win situation and will drive a wedge between you and everyone you care about and isn\u2019t blinking an eye. Why does protecting him mean you have to suffer? Why does protecting him mean your future husband doesn\u2019t have a right to know what happened and how to manage the situation as a team? A team is what you\u2019re supposed to be but you\u2019ve decided to go solo and it\u2019s going to continue to damage the foundation of your relationship and marriage. \n\nAsk yourself what your brother is trying to accomplish? He loves your fianc\u00e9 so much he wants him to be miserable for the rest of his life and not marry someone he loves? Your fianc\u00e9 will find solace in him and miraculously decide to spend his life with your brother? \n\nThe reality is, the two of you are getting married and will have a life together. This situation is bigger than a wedding and is in fact about the future of your marriage and your relationship with your family.", "You really need to reevaluate your thought process here. It\u2019s not about \u201couting\u201d your brother. You will be building your marriage on a huge secret and it won\u2019t go well. Your brother is also suffering with his secret to the extent that he thought it was reasonable to ask you to cancel the wedding. He needs to be able to work through these emotions and enabling him to keep pushing them down in the name of \u201ckeeping a secret,\u201d it\u2019s not helpful.", "Your allegiance to your brother is admirable but doesn\u2019t trump allegiance to husband. Don\u2019t start marriage with a lie.", "This is the person you\u2019re building a life with he has a right to know. He will resent you for his best friend not being there. Is this how you want to start your life with him?", "Ok then. Your options are invite him back and let everyone believe you were the problem. Or don\u2019t invite him back and let everyone believe you are the problem. He isn\u2019t going to set the record straight. You are the villain in his story. He isn\u2019t thinking about you or your happiness. You have to find a way to get your happy outcome but it won\u2019t happen so long as you stay as you are.", "I understand that it's not OK to out people, but your brother is causing you real harm here. You are caught between a rock and a hard place after uninviting him and you are the one catching all the flak because you can't tell people why. That is incredibly unfair of him. If you re-invite him, do you think he might cause a scene at the wedding? But then if he doesn't want to out himself he'll just have to put up with it.\n\nIf you don't want to re-invite him, at the very least you need to tell your fiance that this is not what really happened. You could tell him that your brother asked you to break up with him and he needs to ask your brother what the reasons for that are.\n\nI also like how your brother told you to break up with your fiance because of his own feelings. So your fiance's feelings for you count for nothing, right? He obviously doesn't care about his friend's happiness at all! What an asshole he is!\n\nNTA - but you do need to sort this out one way or another. Good luck!", "So you\u2019re going to start your marriage with lies. Very mature of you.", "Be prepared to lose your partner then. You're starting your marriage on a lie... a lie your brother forced but still a lie. This will not end well.", "Hope you\u2019re willing to lose your relationship over it. You are lying to your fianc\u00e9 right this second by not telling him the real reason you uninvited your brother. Are you sure you\u2019re not scared he likes your brother back? Cause I can\u2019t think of any other reason you would hide something like this from the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.", "Will your fianc\u00e9 resent you for not inviting his best friend to the wedding?", "Why can\u2019t you tell your brother to talk to your fianc\u00e9 about why he wants you to cancel the wedding? You don\u2019t have to out your brother, you can ask your brother to explain his position to his best friend, so you don\u2019t have to.", "He probably didn\u2019t block your fianc\u00e9", "All of this, otherwise, your brother will make an art studio for him", "This right here. You obviously feel very strongly about not outing your brother and that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s your decision to make. Tell your fianc\u00e9 as much of the truth as you can. And let him know that your brother has a good reason but he (fianc\u00e9) needs to ask his best friend. That puts the responsibility on your brother. It\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t do the same with the rest of your family. I wish I had some advice there.", " Bump", "I agree with most of what you said but if she's not comfortable outing her brother she should have her partner ask her brother why.  She can tell her partner is not her story to tell and he needs to get it from her brother.", "This", "It actually isn't even a difficult call the more I think about it.\n\nBeing outed is terrible. I'm glad I didn't have to ever really go through that myself. You genuinely shouldn't even consider it in almost any circumstance. \n\nYet... you actually do lose the right to some privacy re your sexuality when you're trying to torpedo your siblings wedding. Like we've almost all seen or are aware of the trope of being in love with your straight friend. But letting it get so bad that you're setting your sister's wedding on fire? Nah that's too much the fiance needs to be aware of what's going on.", "Nah, if I had to sit through months of barbs and AH comments about me as a person and a future wife from someone who knows me better than most and is supposed to love me unconditionally, I\u2019m not ready to put my nice face on and continue catering to them.", "This is the fourth time in two days I\u2019ve seen the art studio mentioned LOL", "Don't forget the yogurt.", "But her brother is lying about it already. What makes you think he'll suddenly confess and stop laying the blame on OP?", "It\u2019s time to put your shiny spine on and not let your brother walk all over you. He is relying on your compassion to turn everyone against you. You need to at the very least tell your fianc\u00e9, otherwise you will be building this marriage on lies and then you might as well cancel it if you\u2019re going to lie by omission to your future husband. Who needs a partner that won\u2019t be honest with them?", "As a bi person, you need to tell your fiance *and only your fianc\u00e9.* your brother decided to involve *both of you*. You don't think your fiance deserves to know that his best friend is trying to sabotage your relationship and why? What happens when your brother whispers lies in his ear to make him break up with you? He won't know there's a reason and can believe the lies. You owe it to both your partner and to yourself to be honest in this situation.", "Good grief, you need to tell your fianc\u00e9 yourself!\n\nLeaving it to your brother is too risky. He's already omitted and lied to everyone about you. You're still willing to let him twist and lie about the facts even more to your fianc\u00e9 and permanently damaging the start of your marriage? Like someone said, you're burning yourself to keep someone else warm. This won't go well for you.\n\nIf you can't be honest with your life partner from the get go then you aren't ready for this union. Your fianc\u00e9 should be your priority and that includes telling your future husband the truth. You're being really silly about this and making it way more complicated than it has to be.\n\nYou don't need to out your brother to the rest of the family, just tell them that what he said is not the truth, that he isn't supportive of your marriage (he really is not) and they can ask him themselves the real reason why as it's not your place to say.\n\nN T A - there's no guarantee he won't do something to ruin the wedding even if after all this, he sounds vindictive and right now his emotions are pretty high. You'll be putting it all at risk if you hadn't uninvited him.\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm changing my verdict to YTA after reading your replies.\n\n1) You feel so strongly not outing your brother who is actually messing with your wedding and marriage, who is not supportive. He's manipulated his problems onto you and you're unwilling to do anything go actually defend yourself.\n\n2) You're supposed to be an adult about to get married but haven't grown a spine in all that time.\n\n3) You're shirking out of doing the difficult but necessary conversations and actions.\n\n4) Biggest: You're TA because you're willing to start your marriage based on lies.", "I agree with you on not outing your brother even to your fianc\u00e9. I get where everyone is coming from. He deserves the truth, but it\u2019s not your truth to share. I\u2019m really surprised your fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t talked to him 1 on 1 about this since it happened especially since he\u2019s best man/friend. I would tell him my brother told me a personal thing about why he literally doesn\u2019t want the marriage to happen that even though I love you very much isn\u2019t my business to share so take it up with him. He may make assumptions that may be accurate. Don\u2019t confirm or deny. It could be an inadvertent outing, but it\u2019s better than saying he\u2019s in love with you. IMHO. You are between a rock and hard place. Good luck. I do appreciate he\u2019s at least said he\u2019s insulted you bc yeah it\u2019s forgivable, but he did put the blame on himself.", "You need to sit down with both of them and encourage your brother to tell the truth because you look like a liar to your fianc\u00e9 because of him. I respect you for not wanting to out him. He could call you a liar anyway so it could be moot if your fianc\u00e9 doesn't know who to believe. You can even tell your fianc\u00e9 that in order to respect your brother you are lying even if you don't wish to be, but that it's up to your brother for the truth to come to light.", "As a bi person, you need to tell your fiance *and only your fianc\u00e9.* your brother decided to involve *both of you*.

But it is starting to affect your relationship with your fianc\u00e9. If I were you I would make it clear to your brother that you love him, but the wedding is going ahead. He can choose to attend or not. You\u2019ve taken yourself out of the equation and now it\u2019s for your brother to deal with or not, as the case may be. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019d implore him to at least explain the situation to your fianc\u00e9. Unrequited love can fester and can sour; having his heart gently broken may be the only medicine for that. Otherwise it could be a life time of \u201cwhat ifs\u201d for him, no matter how unrealistic.", "This. In the clear light of day my heart would break for my brother on two fronts\u2014not being able to be himself publicly and to have had to watch his sibling be with the man he loves. And I\u2019d reach back out to him with love and support. \n\nBut that does not give him a free pass to treat his sister the way he has been and does not mitigate the shock she would have felt in the moment either. Disinviting him was the wrong thing to do, no doubt. But him waiting until the wedding cake has been baked and frosted is eons too late to have brought this up. Two things can be true at once.", "This is the fourth time in the last few hours for me.", "The Iranian yogurt is not the issue here!"]}
