I was getting worried, maybe he knew something about my fianc\u00e9, maybe he was protecting me. But he denied it, he said my fianc\u00e9 is great but I need to cancel it.

If you clear the air and he's on his best behavior, great. And if he tries to pull anything, what is he going to do? He's not going to out himself in front of the entire family just to try to stop the wedding. And at that point, if he does try or say anything, then it's just going to reflect poorly on him. If he tries anything drastic to prevent the wedding after you try to reason with him, then that's when you should be taking drastic measures. \n\nAlso, try to avoid direct contact with your brother, give him some space (after one last attempt to resolve this).

I wholeheartedly agree that no-one should out anyone, but your brother hasn't been reasonable here - this isn't a normal situation. At the very least, start by telling your OH that your brother insisted that you cancel the wedding. That he went on and on about it. That might be enough to make your OH wonder if your brother should really be there. He might even reach out to your brother and insist on a reason. That could get your brother to back down and you won't have outed him. However, if your OH doesn't think there's any concern in your brother insisting you cancel the wedding, then you should tell your OH but swear him to secrecy. At least you will have one person on your side you understands why you did what you did, even if he ultimately says that your brother should be invited again.

I\u2019m sorry you are going through this and that your brother put you in this situation. He had months to speak to your fianc\u00e9 and to you prior.

Your fiance deserves to know.\n\nNTA", "I would never out my brother. How could I even tell my partner?", "He\u2019s blocked me on everything", "No, I know my partner loves me.

I would never out anyone", "I mean\u2026he tried to get OP to cancel the wedding entirely, I don\u2019t blame them for being worried, especially since they said their brother was supportive until the engagement when he became bitter. \n\nPlus, I also don\u2019t blame OP for not wanting someone who\u2019s in love with their fianc\u00e9 to be not only at their wedding but in the wedding party itself. There is a TON of risk with the brother being the best man and not just a regular guest\u2014he\u2019s way more involved, will be in a very prominent place, and will likely have the opportunity to give a speech.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter if he isn\u2019t going to express those exact feelings, he has been explicitly sharing his negative feelings about the wedding and \u201cjoking\u201d about how terrible a wife she\u2019ll be. He hasn\u2019t held his tongue even if they don\u2019t know why.", "I\u2019m sorry how was I supposed to respond to that?? I was caught off guard and now he\u2019s blocked me on everything", "Talk pit admitting to being in love with her fianc\u00e9? What exactly does resolution look like there in the moment??", "\u201cSomething so huge\u201d as being in love with his sister\u2019s future husband? Nah. The time for bro to bring this up has come and gone. He dropped a bomb on her.", "Absolutely. You're about to be married and this affects both of you. Your fiance needs to know what's going on.", "You could tell your partner that your brother told you he does not support the two of you getting married and wants you to cancel the wedding, and that it has nothing to do with anything you or your partner have done. You uninvited him because you were afraid he would sabotage the day. Tell him he needs to talk to your brother himself.\n\nYour partner has to learn the truth somehow, or if not the truth then at least he needs to believe and accept that there is a good reason but that it's not yours to share.\n\nIf you move forward with a lie, or without your partner accepting you're doing this for a very good reason, it will end terribly.", "Your fianc\u00e9 wants you to sort it out with your brother.  Tell him you can't sort it out until he knows the full extent of why you uninvited your brother.  Let your fianc\u00e9 know that your brother's comments weren't jokes and is adamant about you two not getting married.  Then tell him why.", "No offense but it\u2019s going sour your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 if you don\u2019t tell him.\n\nAnd in the end you will have ruined relationship with your soon-to-be ex fianc\u00e9 and family because of a lie your brother came up with.\n\nHe choose to put you in a tough spot. I agree it\u2019s not your right to out him, but you are giving up basically a stable future with your fianc\u00e9 and family for him. Cause believe it or not your fianc\u00e9 will end up resenting you for not having his best friend at the wedding.", "If you can't tell your fianc\u00e9, tell them you only want people who support this marriage at our wedding.  Your brother was very serious with his comments about not getting married.  You just can't have people present at the wedding who do not support your marriage and want to celebrate it.", "As a gay person this is one instance where I would say it is ok to tell your fianc\u00e9 this isn\u2019t him being gay dosnt effect anything type scenario now if you outed him to everyone in your family then ywbta your fianc\u00e9 needs to know and you need to tell him before you get married", "One: sorry but your fianc\u00e9 has a right to know what is happening. You are lighting yourself on fire to keep your brother warm and your relationship with your fianc\u00e9 *will* go up in flames.\n\nTwo: for everyone else, you don\u2019t have to out him. But you are allowed to say \u201cHe lied to you, that\u2019s not what happened, it\u2019s not my place to say, but if you want the truth, ask him.\u201d\n\nYour brother can choose to confess, or drop it and say he wants to keep it private, or continue lying but, whatever the option he takes, you\u2019re at least not being his doormat, copping all the flak for something that isn\u2019t your fault.", "Are you concerned for your brothers safety if he was outed? Is the place you live/your family homophobic? Would your fianc\u00e9 react negatively/aggressively if told? Do you think he would tell other people even if you asked him not to?\n\nIs any part of you afraid your fianc\u00e9 might be in love with him too?\n\nI think you owe your fianc\u00e9 the truth. You would want him to tell you the truth. I would hope you feel like you can trust your partner to keep your confidence and not tell anyone. I would also hope that you wouldn\u2019t be engaged to someone who is homophobic/potentially dangerous. But I\u2019m not gonna pretend that outing someone can be life threatening. \n\nI guess the answer depends on what kind of man your fianc\u00e9 is. But assuming he is a good man and you don\u2019t live in a place or situation where being gay is dangerous I think you should tell him. And I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to marry someone you won\u2019t be honest with.", "You must! If he finds out you knew and kept it from him there will be big problems. As you are getting married your priority should be your soon to be husband, not your brother. But you are NTA.", "I get you don\u2019t want to out your brother but what if your fianc\u00e9 gives you and ultimatum? I mean they were friends before you and him got together. Reinvite your brother or the wedding is off? Than what? Your brother comes to the wedding and ruins your special day? you should really talk with your fianc\u00e9 about this at less. Just ask him \u201chave you noticed how my brother has been acting lately\u201d like really make hints if you don\u2019t want to out your brother. Maybe your fianc\u00e9 will pick up on it.", "He\u2019s your partner! You need to share this with him. As a queer person I support sharing this with him. Your brother has forced your hand. You don\u2019t need to tell everyone, but your partner needs to know so you can decide how to move forward TOGETHER", "Your partner likely already knows his best friend is gay but may not know he's in love with him.. how can you keep this from your partner??", "Bumping someone else\u2019s suggestion to tell your partner that your sibling is adamantly against the wedding and asked you to cancel it and this is why you disinvited. The reasons why? \u201cThat\u2019s for your best friend to tell you\u201d", "Oh OP. This must be incredibly stressful. I\u2019m certain your brother is terrified and confused - I can\u2019t think of an more awful position to find yourself in - but you are navigating a minefield here without help. \n\nI respect that you don\u2019t want to out your brother to the whole family - a well worded response might help here, \u201cmy brother and I have had a disagreement. It\u2019s private in nature, thank you for respecting our privacy on this issue. \u201c\n\nBut your fianc\u00e9\u2026 that\u2019s a tough one.

YTA.", "I hear you but are you willing to let your relationship suffer with your fianc\u00e9 by beginning your married life with a lie. Can you tell your brother to come clean to your fianc\u00e9 or you will? If this comes our later I don\u2019t think your fianc\u00e9 will appreciate the lie. ESH except your fianc\u00e9, you because lying and your bro for starting crap right before your wedding.", "As a queer person, usually I would say that you should never out someone, but your brother is forcing your hand. He refuses to unblock you or get in contact with you again, and he made HIS feelings and HIS sexuality your problem when he confessed his feelings for your fianc\u00e9 + tried to sabotage your relationship with negativity and pressure. \n\nPlus, it directly involves your fianc\u00e9 too, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019d want to know what\u2019s happening with his best friend, and he should be allowed to make an informed decision about what to do. The fact that he\u2019s in love with your fianc\u00e9 is a completely different context to your brother insulting you or not supporting the marriage for other reasons: it permanently changes the dynamic between the three of you and the perspective you\u2019ll have towards each other", "I don't think you have a choice really.  Your fiance is never going to accept you not inviting your brother his best friend without a good excuse.  So if you can't tell him then you need reinvite him.  But at some point you three will have to have a talk about this subject.", "If you don't tell him, you should not marry him.   You don't keep secrets from your mate if you give a shit about the relationship.", "I understand not wanting to out your brother, but you need to tell your fianc\u00e9. \n\nYour brother has put all three of you in a terrible situation that has immediate consequences (the wedding) and long-term consequences (how are you and your husband going to family events in the future). Eventually, this will come out and you will be burned because you are lying by omission to your financ\u00e9.", "YTA if you do not tell your fianc\u00e9. How to proceed is a decision you need to make together. If you can\u2019t handle that then you\u2019re already failing at your first test of marriage. Congrats. Now you\u2019ve just lost a husband and a brother because they fly off to Buenos Aries and leave you to take care of the baby all alone.", "Dunno, I have a brother and I probably would have responded with something like, \u201cHoly shit, I wasn\u2019t expecting that. This must be really hard for you, but you\u2019ve got to know that we love each other and can\u2019t call off the wedding. But, I love you, too, and I know that Fianc\u00e9 really cares for you. Do you need space from this, or can we all have an open conversation and see if we can find a way to talk through it to the point that you can come?\u201d", "Has he blocked you from going to his front door to talk to him?", "I doubt there\u2019d be resolution in the moment, but yelling, \u201cYou can\u2019t come!\u201d and running away is 100% not leading in that direction.", "No I\u2019m not concerned about his safety. I know my family and my partner wouldn\u2019t care if he was gay or not. It\u2019s just not my place to out anyone. But I understand what a lot of people are saying. Idk why people are so pissed at me for not wanting to out him. But to those saying I could tell my fianc\u00e9 what happened but tell him that he\u2019ll have to ask my brother himself what was the reason. And no, I\u2019m not worried that my partner is in love with him too.", "Hope OP sees this", "..coincidentally neither is trying to sabotage the wedding of two people I love for my own selfish reasons. Both can be wrong. Her brother however is the extra wrong here for lying after the situation. He\u2019s not operating in good faith. He\u2019s being an AH and a liar.", "I feel this is a good plan when dealing with a reasonable person. He has made you the issue. He is fine with that. Giving your fianc\u00e9 the opportunity to hear him without you saying something gives him the opportunity to lie further. He doesn\u2019t care about your feelings or the toll it\u2019s taking on you, because he\u2019s made no effort to be honest. You\u2019re being a good sister and ally by not wanting to out him, however keeping it from your fianc\u00e9 is very risky when you simply cannot count on your brother to do the right thing."]}
