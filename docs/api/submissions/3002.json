She and her husband (now my step dad) got married in a courtroom, and a few months later he and his children moved in to our house, and almost one year ago we all moved in to another house. I saw my sd a few times before the marriage, but never meet his son and daughter until they moved in. \n\nI will call the older one Mike, he is 17, and the younger Lisa, she is 12.\n\nWhen we were at our previous home, I spent most of the time at my room, and we spoke very few times a week, and they left me alone most of the time.\n\nBut our new house, besides being bigger and having more rooms, feels like a downgrade, and very few rooms has locks, only the front, back, and our parents' room has locks.\n\nSince we moved in, my step siblings has been bothering me, entering my room. Lisa likes to have sleep-overs with her friends. I was out of the house one saturday, and when I came back, found out that Lisa and her friends took everything from my closet, they tried every single cloth and outfit I had, and damaged some of them. We said many nasty things to each others, but my mom and sd said that they were just playing, and shouldn't be hard on them.\n\nAfter letting her go scold free, Lisa started taking my cloths more often without my permission, and also stole cash from me. Mike also has been entering my room, once he filmed a tiktok going through my hygiene products, and people at my school saw it. Mom and sd made him delete the video, but I still get bullied for it.\n\nOne night I caught him peeking through a gap in the door, while I was doing homework in underwear, and told my mom about it, but she defended him, and said that I shouldn't be in underwear around boys.\n\n2 days ago while I was out, Mike wanted to use my laptop to play some game (he doesn't have a computer), but couldn't guess my password, so he formatted my drive and installed a pirated version of Windows and installed the game he wanted. All of my things, homeworks, photos, movies, art, were gone.\n\nI cried for hours, and begged my mom to buy locks for my bedroom, because I can't take it anymore.\n\nShe said that didn't rise me to be so entitled, to stop throwing tantrums, that I don't know the real value of things, locks are expensive, and that maybe I should try to build a good relationship with my step siblings.\n\nSo I told everything to my grandma, and she said that I'm welcomed in her home, but my mom found out, and said that if I go to my grandma's, I better not come back.\n\nIm so tired, and I dont know if im being entitled or unreasonable.", "created_utc": 1669165253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2awdr/aita_for_throwing_a_tantrum_demanding_that_my_mom/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom has shown that she is not going to stand up for you when it comes to her new family.

You're not the asshole. You're not entitled. You're not unreasonable. The one who are throwing tantrums are not you. Your mom does not know the real value of things.

If necessary ask your friends parents to help you transport all your things and feel free to tell anyone who asks why you don\u2019t feel safe in your own home unless you think that would make your mother feel like she has to force you to stay in order to save face. \n\nIt might be worth mentioning anyways in case Mike is also watching Lisa undressed.", "Oh gosh, your parents are completely ignoring you.  Can you install a lock on your own door?  It's not very hard to replace a standard door handle with one that locks.
