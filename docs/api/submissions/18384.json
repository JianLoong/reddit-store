{"id": 18384, "submission_id": "13u3ys6", "title": "AITA for telling my sister that I don't care about how her wedding turns out?", "selftext": "My (29M) sister (26F) has always been incredibly spoiled. It\u2019s always her way or the highway, so I knew that when she got engaged she would be a handful. Her wedding is coming up in about a year and she has already started planning. She sat us all down (my mother, father, and my other sister) and told us what they had decided for the theme. Now personally, I think it\u2019s a little tacky to put a theme on the wedding, but it\u2019s not my wedding, so I held my tongue. Her theme was nature, and this was applied to everything. She wanted a \u201cfloral lace dress\u201d, succulents as favors, and for the ceremony to take place in a greenhouse. Again, tacky, but not my wedding, so I didn\u2019t say anything. The issue arose when it came time to talk about the reception venue. She said that she wanted it to be outdoors in one of those huge event tents with windows so that we could be in nature. My whole family hated this idea. An outdoor reception just seems very cheap and not at all classy. We suggested that she go with something a little more classic, like an event venue, but she had her mind set.\n\n  \nI got really upset because the entire family was telling her that they would prefer one thing and she was insisting she do another when she was literally the only person who wanted it. At first, I tried to go easy on her by telling her that themed weddings are just a fad and if she commits to her theme so heavily, she\u2019ll look back on it in 20 years and cringe, and that it\u2019s better to choose something timeless, like a simpler dress and a hotel ballroom. I said that she could definitely incorporate flowers into the centerpieces and decorations if she wanted, but to have the whole wedding centered around plants and flowers just seemed like too much. Never one to take advice, my sister just said that she\u2019s sorry we feel that way but her and her fianc\u00e9 have wanted this for their wedding for years and they spent a lot of time coming up with the details together, and they wanted their wedding to \u201creflect their personalities and who they are as a couple\u201d, and she didn\u2019t think my timeless suggestions would be able to do that. Here\u2019s where I might be the asshole: I kind of let my frustration get the better of me and said \u201cFine, I don\u2019t care if your wedding turns out to be tacky. I knew you were going to be an inflexible bridezilla anyway\u201d. I do think that she was being too rigid and just thinking about what she would like instead of what her family and guests would prefer, but my parents say that it\u2019s my sister\u2019s wedding and that it wasn\u2019t cool to say that I didn\u2019t care.
