{"id": 18384, "submission_id": "13u3ys6", "title": "AITA for telling my sister that I don't care about how her wedding turns out?", "selftext": "My (29M) sister (26F) has always been incredibly spoiled. It\u2019s always her way or the highway, so I knew that when she got engaged she would be a handful. Her wedding is coming up in about a year and she has already started planning. She sat us all down (my mother, father, and my other sister) and told us what they had decided for the theme. Now personally, I think it\u2019s a little tacky to put a theme on the wedding, but it\u2019s not my wedding, so I held my tongue. Her theme was nature, and this was applied to everything. She wanted a \u201cfloral lace dress\u201d, succulents as favors, and for the ceremony to take place in a greenhouse. Again, tacky, but not my wedding, so I didn\u2019t say anything. The issue arose when it came time to talk about the reception venue. She said that she wanted it to be outdoors in one of those huge event tents with windows so that we could be in nature. My whole family hated this idea. An outdoor reception just seems very cheap and not at all classy. We suggested that she go with something a little more classic, like an event venue, but she had her mind set.\n\n  \nI got really upset because the entire family was telling her that they would prefer one thing and she was insisting she do another when she was literally the only person who wanted it. At first, I tried to go easy on her by telling her that themed weddings are just a fad and if she commits to her theme so heavily, she\u2019ll look back on it in 20 years and cringe, and that it\u2019s better to choose something timeless, like a simpler dress and a hotel ballroom. I said that she could definitely incorporate flowers into the centerpieces and decorations if she wanted, but to have the whole wedding centered around plants and flowers just seemed like too much. Never one to take advice, my sister just said that she\u2019s sorry we feel that way but her and her fianc\u00e9 have wanted this for their wedding for years and they spent a lot of time coming up with the details together, and they wanted their wedding to \u201creflect their personalities and who they are as a couple\u201d, and she didn\u2019t think my timeless suggestions would be able to do that. Here\u2019s where I might be the asshole: I kind of let my frustration get the better of me and said \u201cFine, I don\u2019t care if your wedding turns out to be tacky. I knew you were going to be an inflexible bridezilla anyway\u201d. I do think that she was being too rigid and just thinking about what she would like instead of what her family and guests would prefer, but my parents say that it\u2019s my sister\u2019s wedding and that it wasn\u2019t cool to say that I didn\u2019t care.

It isn\u2019t my wedding anyway\u201d.\n\nCorrect. So, why are you upset? You got me at the \u201cI got really upset and tried to explain xyz to her\u201d like who even cares? Why are YOU angry? It seems that she isn\u2019t the spoiled one, but rather that you\u2019re extremely controlling. \n\nStop trying to control your sister. She wants a themed wedding, whatever. Just be glad you\u2019re invited at all. I\u2019d keep your mouth shut before she wises up and never speaks to you again.", "YTA. For all it really matters most of the time, couples (or, sure, other arrangements) absolutely should be able to decide what kind of wedding they have, themed or otherwise. Assuming costs can be met, and so on.", "Yta, what a way to ruin your sister's excitement.\nShe was sharing her ideas to HER wedding with you guys (her family) and instead of supporting her \nYou all felt that HER WEDDING needs to be cater around what you wants??\n\n\nDon't blame her if she decides that she won't shared nothing of the wedding planning with you \n\n\nYou sound like the spoiled one, you want her wedding, to be want you want.. are you even reading yourself?\n\n\nAnd not only that but when she declined your ideas for HER WEDDING you get mad?? About what exactly?? \n\n\nRead it again HER WEDDING, HER PARTY, HER ONCE IN A LIFETIME MOMENT \n\n\nIt has nothing to do with you... a**hole", "YTA, big time. Why do you care? Are you paying for the wedding?  Weddings are stressful enough without some asshole telling you what you should do.  In this case you have two assholes, one being your mouth, so shut your asshole, somehow make it smile and don\u2019t be the asshole again on the day of her wedding telling your table \u201cwhat she should have done\u201d.  If you can\u2019t do that and be happy for her, don\u2019t go.  You suck.", "YTA. Her wedding, her design choices. Others keep their opinions to themselves.", "YTA but it\u2019s your sister that is the issue. Sure\u2026\u2026. Your basic bitc\u2026. Suggestions aren\u2019t anything but a run of the mill boring ass wedding. Outdoor weddings can be extravagant and super classy. Something different than church and local horseshit ballroom. It\u2019s not your wedding.", "YTA. It's her wedding, not yours. You don't get to dictate her choices.", "You keep using the word tacky. I do not think it means what you think it means.", "YTA. You and the rest of her family sound insufferable.", "ESH. Why is the family telling her what to do with her wedding anyway? I mean if they're paying.... Maybe. But what's so terrible about an outdoor venue? Is it August? Please the bride and groom. Is it money? What's the big deal?", "ESH. She sat you down like you were supposed to care, and like you were supposed to support her wedding choices. And yet she didn't listen to anyone. That's about equally as shitty as you crapping all over her ceremonial choices.", "NTA - what your sister is describing is an Instagrammable wedding. In twenty years, the Instagram esthetic is going to look tragically dated. \n\nI\u2019m with you, I hate everything about bride culture and the wedding industrial complex. Can you just opt out of the whole ridiculously wasteful, tacky thing?", "I can't care enough to declare the AH here. All I can think is \"Thank God I'm not the groom\" it's her wedding, not theirs, groom is just going w it to keep pease. She will get what she wants no matter who goes down in the effort. Let her have what she wants. The groom is taking a bullet for the rest of us and getting her out of circulation. \nThe only thing for anyone to worry about (except Daddy paying for it) is after the divorce, and she is once again unleashed on an unsuspecting dating pool.", "I cannot fathom why he even cares.", "It's not just that it would likely be cheaper, it's that that's one of the things he's *criticizing* her for.  \n\nI also wouldn't take his word for her being spoiled at all.  These stories should always be read assuming a bit of an unreliable narrator, but calling her spoiled as a lead in to a story where her parents are apparently telling her not to have the wedding she wants, to have a more expensive one, is a pretty glaring example.", "This\n\nYou are my spirit animal <3", "Yeah he has some nerve calling her spoiled when he's in here whining about how she won't tailor her own wedding according to HIS wishes.", "I\u2019ve never heard \u201cnature\u201d dismissed as cringey before. \n\nFloral decor of various types is pretty mainstream and traditional? \n\nIf she were planning to intertwine dirt-covered tree roots in her hair or something, I would understand OP\u2019s reaction a little bit better, but still, if someone else\u2019s choices aren\u2019t actually doing anyone any  harm, it\u2019s always better to keep your mouth shut about them rather than be insulting.", "Yeah, I was waiting to hear the tacky theme, and was \u201coh.\u201d", "OP, why do you think you get a vote on how your sister plans her wedding?\n\nIt's HER wedding, not yours.  Keep your opinions to yourself.\n\nYTA", "Exactly this !!  OP is extremely judgemental and rude \u2026 No room for different aesthetics in OPs life I guess \n\n \u201c\u2026but not my wedding\u201d   REMEMBER this!!  And keep your tacky opinions to yourself.      It\u2019s not about YOU     \n\nYTA", "Absolutely!! And by the time you arrange for them to be decorated, lights strung up, furniture etc they aren\u2019t usually the \u2018cheap\u2019 choice either!", "I also went to a greenhouse wedding and it was really beautiful. I don\u2019t really think of this as a tacky theme. Outdoor receptions can be very nice, especially at night with gorgeous lighting. You should consider going into Pinterest and checking some out before criticizing your Sister. She isn\u2019t asking for a Disney wedding, but you were pretty judgmental. YTA", "I'm wondering if she really is spoiled or if she is just the different one in her family of self centered AHs", "OP really does sound insufferable", "Right?! I was expecting him to say they wanted everyone to dress as a furry or something."]}
