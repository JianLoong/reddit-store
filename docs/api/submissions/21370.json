He couldve severely hurt your cat. wtf", "Your brother is a moron and so are your parents for siding with him.\n\nI\u2019d have wanted 100% of the cost to be quite honest.\n\nHe would also not be going anywhere near my pets again after this.\n\nNTA", "NTA, especially as\n\n>He asked if he could try giving her some chocolate, and I told him \u201cNo, that\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d\n\nHe should be fronting the entire bill and kept away from pets.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re mother is right, everyone makes mistake. But theres no reason why you should have to pay for the mistakes", "NTA. You trusted him with your cat and told him that the cat can't have chocolate but he did it anyway. No regard for your cat or you. I'm glad the kitty is okay. Your brother on the other hand, a fucking asshole. He won't pay even though he should. Never let him see your cat again.", "Half? He should be paying for all treatment. He poisoned your cat. I'd be doing everything possible to ensure he pays.", "YTA. Cats don't understand money! But seriously, communication is key. Talk it out. Meow-tual agreement needed!", "NTA. My question is who the fuck thinks its ok to feed a cat chocolate? You have to hate cats not to know that. You even told him. If someone did that to my animals I'd beat them senseless.", "NTA. Funnily enough, my 14 year old instantly saw the problem. Some adults are a worry. To start with, he asked, he was therefore aware it was bad and did it anyway! He should be paying 100% of the bill. The cat wouldnt have needed a vet if he didnt give it chocolate. So glad kitty is ok. I have 2 cats and would be FURIOUS", "NTA.\n\nNope.\n\nMistakes happen, but when you are told there could be consequences you need to own up to it.\n\n\nWe had cats growing up, one was a super picky eater and anything could cause her stomach to turn. \nThe other, a stomach of iron. \nShe once ate a full cadbury chocolate bar. \nI was convinced she was going to die, the vet was shocked that she didn\u2019t even so much as pass gas.\n\nEither way chocolate is not good for pets, same with certain fruits, veg and house plants.\n\nYou specifically told your bother no.\nExplained it could harm the cat and how dangerous it was.\nHe ignored you.\nTherefore he should have paid the entire amount.\n\nYour parents are fools and ignorant to the fact that your beloved cat could have died from your brothers stupid mistake.\n\nTake care of your cat, don\u2019t leave any of your family members alone with it.", "NTA\n\nYou told him not to and he did it anyway. Your cat could have died. I'd make him pay the full bill.", "NTA - \"everyone makes mistakes\" BS! It would have eben a mistake to leave a piece of chocolate on the coffeetable unattended and going to the bathroom while the unsupervised cat gets to it. It is NOT a mistake to do the opposite of what you are told and risk someones pet's life. That is dumb in a best case scenario. Your brother should have footed the entire bill, dumbass", "You are so much NTA!                    \n\n\nThat brain dead idiot could have killed your cat! Sorry, I know he\u2019s family but I am so mad on your behalf. And your cat\u2019s. Never let him cat sit again.\n\n\nHe should have paid the whole bill.", "That's not a mistake, it's a crime.\n\nYou should have asked to pay the full amount.", "NTA. He should pay all of it.", "NTA, paying just half is too kind. Also, he didn\u2019t make a mistake. He asked, you told him not to do it, he did it anyway. Ignore your parents, they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.", "Uh NTA. WTF. You told him no and he still did it.", "NTA! The only thing that you potentially were wrong in in this is that you didn\u2019t have your brother pay the entire vet bill, as he definitely should! This wasn\u2019t an innocent mistake on his part!\n\nYour brother is the one at fault here, this is on him entirely (as should the vet bill), he asked you beforehand if he could give your cat chocolate and you told him no and also that it was dangerous to do so, and he decided to do it anyway! This wasn\u2019t a mistake made unknowingly, he went against your very clear instructions and now he (and of course unfortunately the cat, and you) will have to face the consequences and pay for his actions. \n\nNTA, sooo not T A, however your brother and your parents are though! I hope that he pays it all and that he and your parents come to their senses and realises that they\u2019re wrong and that they\u2019re acting like A H\u2019s.", "\ud83d\udcaf!", "Right, I'm so glad someone pointed this out. It was NOT a mistake.

OP never said their gender. For all we know, they're a man.\n\nI've seen plenty of posts here where women got preferential treatment, and also posts where men got preferential treatment.

No big deal. You did it and your dog lived to be 19. There are dogs that don't react to chocolate. But the only way to know is to risk giving it to them and making them super sick. So don't give dogs chocolate. And don't brag about all the chocolate you gave your dog and how long they lived. You are putting other animals at risk.", "The brother was told. Completely different situation.", "I\u2019m mostly downvoting you because your formatting is an eye sore. \n\n\n\n\n\nAlso because you are defending shitty actions through ignorance. You don\u2019t sound regretful at all. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nALSO because I\u2019m not sure how your story is truthful about it not harming the dog. My uncle left half a mars bar on the counter once and their Labrador ate it. There was shit *up the walls* in every room of the house within 30 minutes. The dog had full on explosive poos from even that small amount of chocolate.", "It's a dosage issue. And that's based on body weight. Usually between 15 to 30mg/kg.

I split half a brick of bakers chocolate with my Doberman when I was 5/6 (thank god he lived) but I was a small child! \n\nI think it\u2019s pretty common knowledge by the time your old enough to be getting dumped and making enough money needed for a vet bill.", "I\u2019ve got to say I have never seen a cat willingly take chocolate. Unlike dogs, cats have a greater awareness of what they shouldn\u2019t eat. \n\nMy cats are very good curious they feel the god given right to investigate all my food, this has included chocolate which they turn their nose up at. Regardless of knowing their response, I always supervise them around food- if their bodies could handle our food, we wouldn\u2019t need cat specific food.\n\nUnless you\u2019re aware your cat is prone to trying things it shouldn\u2019t, I hate to be the person to point out that your brother had a very intentional and nasty want to harm your cat. \n\nI would tell your parents to mind their business and that if your brother hadn\u2019t expressly chosen to go against your wishes for your cats safety then he wouldn\u2019t have had to pay anything.\n\nPeople have a bad habit of making others and other things feel worse than themselves when in pain, the fact that most people regret doing that afterward is another thing entirely.\n\nYou\u2019re correct in not trusting him around your cat again.", "Yes, he can find another place to stay.

Men are often coddled by their mothers and not expected to 'know' certain obvious things. Women conversely are often coddled by non-relatives while judged more harshly by their parents, and they aren't expected to 'control their feelings' Then there's confounding factors such as parenthood, where being a mother for example is either raising you to deity level or it's making you a villain, depending on what POV is writing the tale!", "Very lucky.          \nI loved that dog.         \nIf I had known it was even slightly dangerous I would not have given it her.           \nShe did live until she was 19", "Also the animal may not necessarily die but could have problems with vomiting and diarrhea....I wonder if this commenter grew up with a dog that constantly had the shits and never put 2 and 2 together...", "I too question the validity of the story - people have a tendency to add on extra years to their pet's age as time goes on.

My cat will eat all kinds of human food (not because we give it to her, but she is very talented at getting into soft wrappings like tin foil or crinkly plastic cake boxes).

We had a cat years ago who was an absolute sweet tooth, would attempt to steal pancakes and apple tea cakes and any other spongy cake like thing he could macgyver his way into, he\u2019d never touch chocolate though, would go to great pains to nibble around chocolate to get cake. \nHe was always fit as a fiddle.\nCats know very very well what they should and shouldn\u2019t eat!", "Hahah I had a cat like this, he got the wrapping off a pack of 12 muffins and ate the very top off each single muffin over night!"]}
