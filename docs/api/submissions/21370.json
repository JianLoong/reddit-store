Honestly he should have paid all of it.  Your brother and your parents are the assholes in this situation.", "NTA, your brother is a double-dingus - #1, you directly told him not to feed your cat chocolate. All he had to do was listen to you. #2, almost everyone knows that chocolate is bad for dogs and cats. It\u2019s easily the most commonly known food allergy for pets. \n\nI would have him foot the entire bill, if you were so inclined. You\u2019d easily be justified in doing so.", "NTA.  It wasn't a mistake, it was a choice", "NTA he should have paid all of it! He went against your express wishes.\n\neta: your parents are also ridiculous here. Everyone makes mistakes....and should also own up and face the consequences.", "Depending on his age, he got off lucky with the bill, considering the damage that could have been done.  There seems to be deeper psychological issues here if someone could be so callous about defenceless animals", "NTA. And I would have asked him to pay the entire bill.", "NTA. He should pay the full bill. YWBTA if you left him alone with your cat ever again. This sounds intentional.", "NTA.  \n\nIt was nice of you to only charge him half the bill.  I don\u2019t know how old everyone is.  But it sounds like he\u2019s old enough to have known better.", "NTA He didn\u2019t make a mistake. He deliberately fed the cat chocolate just to see what would happen even after you told him it was extremely dangerous to cats. That\u2019s not a mistake, Mom. That\u2019s deliberate disregard.", "He should be paying the full bill as he basically tried to poison your cat.\n\nNTA", "Yes you where wrong to ask him to pay half he should of paid the whole bill. Most people with at least half a brain knows you don't give chocolate to a cat.  I'm not sure so nobody come down in me but knowing that you shouldn't give a cat chocolate and then giving the cat chocolate couldn't that be animal cruelty?", "NTA - if I were in your position I would actually be in jail. \ud83d\ude21 You're being nice only asking for half the bill. I would demand all of it and my bother would never get within ten feet of my cat again. At the end of the day though, at least your baby is going to be ok.", "NTA\n\nAfter specifically told not to give the cat chocolate he went ahead and did it! WTF!?!?!? He should pay the entire bill. It was NOT an accident. He was already told not to do it.\n\nDo not let him near your cat again!", "NTA - he should be paying for the entire treatment.  Unless he is a child there is no way this was not an intentional act.   This gave me the ick in a  huge way.  It feels malicious, and I would be seriously reassessing the relationship.", "NTA", "Only half? Parents defending him, they should pay the other half.", "NTA. Holy heck. You told him that feeding her chocolate was dangerous and he did it anyway! I would have sent him the whole bill.", "NTA. Chocolate is **poisonous** to both cats & dogs. Your brother was a grade A Ass Hole for giving your cat chocolate even after you told him it was dangerous. I'm not sure whether it would have mattered if you had told him, it was poisonous. He seems like a dumb ass.\n\nYour cat would have died if you hadn't gotten her to the vet. And it would have been his fault.", "NTA. Yes, everyone makes mistakes. But everyone also has to pay for the consequences of those mistakes.\n\nHonestly, he should pay for the entire bill! This wasn\u2019t really a mistake, but a conscious choice he made after you told him it was dangerous and would hurt the cat. And also, WHY the fuck did he make a conscious choice to do something that would hurt the cat?! There may be something going on with him and he should absolutely not be around your cat or any other animal alone again.", "YTA, likely, but need more info. Your brother sounds like a total and complete moron, or perhaps autistic/disabled, so I question your judgment in letting him hang out around your cat. I mean really? Everyone knows cats and dogs don\u2019t eat chocolate, cats are carnivores\u2026 I\u2019m shocked the cat even ate chocolate. Your brother must be either under the age of 12 or we\u2019re missing some other info.\n\nPlease provide more background so I may revise my assessment.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Chocolate seems to be common knowledge so for him to ask specifically about that and then give the cat chocolate?
