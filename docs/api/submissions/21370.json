All he had to do was listen to you. #2, almost everyone knows that chocolate is bad for dogs and cats. It\u2019s easily the most commonly known food allergy for pets. \n\nI would have him foot the entire bill, if you were so inclined. You\u2019d easily be justified in doing so.", "NTA.

There seems to be deeper psychological issues here if someone could be so callous about defenceless animals", "NTA. And I would have asked him to pay the entire bill.", "NTA. He should pay the full bill. YWBTA if you left him alone with your cat ever again. This sounds intentional.", "NTA.  \n\nIt was nice of you to only charge him half the bill.  I don\u2019t know how old everyone is.  But it sounds like he\u2019s old enough to have known better.", "NTA He didn\u2019t make a mistake.

That\u2019s deliberate disregard.", "He should be paying the full bill as he basically tried to poison your cat.\n\nNTA", "Yes you where wrong to ask him to pay half he should of paid the whole bill. Most people with at least half a brain knows you don't give chocolate to a cat.  I'm not sure so nobody come down in me but knowing that you shouldn't give a cat chocolate and then giving the cat chocolate couldn't that be animal cruelty?", "NTA - if I were in your position I would actually be in jail. \ud83d\ude21 You're being nice only asking for half the bill.

You told him that feeding her chocolate was dangerous and he did it anyway! I would have sent him the whole bill.", "NTA. Chocolate is **poisonous** to both cats & dogs. Your brother was a grade A Ass Hole for giving your cat chocolate even after you told him it was dangerous. I'm not sure whether it would have mattered if you had told him, it was poisonous.

But everyone also has to pay for the consequences of those mistakes.\n\nHonestly, he should pay for the entire bill! This wasn\u2019t really a mistake, but a conscious choice he made after you told him it was dangerous and would hurt the cat. And also, WHY the fuck did he make a conscious choice to do something that would hurt the cat?! There may be something going on with him and he should absolutely not be around your cat or any other animal alone again.", "YTA, likely, but need more info. Your brother sounds like a total and complete moron, or perhaps autistic/disabled, so I question your judgment in letting him hang out around your cat. I mean really? Everyone knows cats and dogs don\u2019t eat chocolate, cats are carnivores\u2026 I\u2019m shocked the cat even ate chocolate.

Chocolate seems to be common knowledge so for him to ask specifically about that and then give the cat chocolate?

Asking if he could do it was testing the waters--if he truly thought it was harmless, he probably would've done it without asking. It just doesn't follow that he'd be thoughtful enough to ask for permission for something \"harmless\" and then go deliberately against your wishes. Plus, it's pretty common knowledge that chocolate is toxic to pets, and even if it wasn't, he heard you say that it was toxic and decided to feed her a little bit of poison anyway. What kind of person does that? Gross. Your parents are either really clueless about how the world works or just as bad as him for excusing that behavior. NTA obviously"]}
