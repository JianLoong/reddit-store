Grandpa may be wrong about that anyway.  If you really want to know, you could do DNA testing on a site like ancestry dot com and see who you are related to.", "It was very kind of your grandfather to let you know about a possible genetic link.  \n\nAs to telling your mom, I'm going with it's not your news to share, not much good would come of it anyway.\n\nNTA if you don't tell her.  If one day she has a DNA test done and finds out, I would act very surprised.  In this case, telling her the truth would only cause her pain.", "NTA- your grandpa did you wrong by telling you and putting this on you. That\u2019s a lot to carry and process. \nTake your time, if you were your mother, would you want your daughter to tell you that news? Ultimately your mother should know. It\u2019s a crap situation your grandparents didn\u2019t tell her. It shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility. \nMaybe you can bring your mother to your grandpa and ask him to tell her while you\u2019re there together. \nHe really put you in a shit situation.", "The DNA results too could point her to her genetic predispositions and possibly help her understand her illness.", "I asked him if he would tell her when we were all together, but he didn't want to break her heart (and potentially take the blame for a situation he didn't create). He wants me to engage with my grandmother and mother to get it out into the open. Unfortunately, I don't see my grandmother cooperating very well in this situation or how to explain how I know.", "IMO, that type of commercial genetic testing available to the public isn't hugely useful for genetic predispositions.  We actually had that type of testing done.  It said we all had a very high genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.  Not one person in my family or extended family has that.  It failed to identify a genetic disorder that almost everybody in my family has.  So that was actually pretty funny.  The point is that they have a long way to go on that type of research.  She could see a genetic counselor, and they would point her to some testing with a higher reliability rate.", "I found the one I had done was pretty insightful, I ran it through Rhonda Patrick's site.  Though you're right, a genetic counselor would be the way to go with such a long standing illness.", "Sounds interesting, I will look her up.", "Definitely will look into a genetic counselor. Years ago, I had gone to one but now with this recent development, things might change. Thanks for the ideas and input both of you!"]}
