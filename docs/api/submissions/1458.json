I am not close (at all) with my grandmother. My grandmother is also not close to my mother. My grandmother also has one other child that is my grandfather's child and who my mom thinks is her full sibling. They have always been very different from each other so the news is not overly surprising (at least to me) because I always thought it was odd how different my mother and her sibling were. He did encourage my mother to talk to my grandmother, but she doesn't understand what he is hinting at.

Grandpa may be wrong about that anyway.  If you really want to know, you could do DNA testing on a site like ancestry dot com and see who you are related to.", "It was very kind of your grandfather to let you know about a possible genetic link.  \n\nAs to telling your mom, I'm going with it's not your news to share, not much good would come of it anyway.\n\nNTA if you don't tell her.  If one day she has a DNA test done and finds out, I would act very surprised.  In this case, telling her the truth would only cause her pain.", "NTA- your grandpa did you wrong by telling you and putting this on you. That\u2019s a lot to carry and process. \nTake your time, if you were your mother, would you want your daughter to tell you that news? Ultimately your mother should know. It\u2019s a crap situation your grandparents didn\u2019t tell her. It shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility. \nMaybe you can bring your mother to your grandpa and ask him to tell her while you\u2019re there together. \nHe really put you in a shit situation.", "The DNA results too could point her to her genetic predispositions and possibly help her understand her illness.", "I asked him if he would tell her when we were all together, but he didn't want to break her heart (and potentially take the blame for a situation he didn't create). He wants me to engage with my grandmother and mother to get it out into the open. Unfortunately, I don't see my grandmother cooperating very well in this situation or how to explain how I know.", "IMO, that type of commercial genetic testing available to the public isn't hugely useful for genetic predispositions.  We actually had that type of testing done.  It said we all had a very high genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.  Not one person in my family or extended family has that.  It failed to identify a genetic disorder that almost everybody in my family has.  So that was actually pretty funny.  The point is that they have a long way to go on that type of research.  She could see a genetic counselor, and they would point her to some testing with a higher reliability rate.", "I found the one I had done was pretty insightful, I ran it through Rhonda Patrick's site.  Though you're right, a genetic counselor would be the way to go with such a long standing illness.", "Sounds interesting, I will look her up.", "Definitely will look into a genetic counselor. Years ago, I had gone to one but now with this recent development, things might change. Thanks for the ideas and input both of you!", "What a hot mess. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, and don't tell your mom unless it becomes absolutely necessary due to medical issues. There's no benefit to telling her and lots of potential hurt. \n\nI'm sorry your grandfather dumped this on you because now you have this earthshaking information and nobody to talk to about it. Someone might say, \"But at least he ket her know there could be a genetic component!\" but without more info, that does her little good. i had genetic testing done when I developed breast cancer. it's pricey: $14,000 four years ago. ! I was lucky that a grant covered the costs. \n\nOP, hoping you find the answers you need and deserve .", "This is the answer. If I had an award to give you Sizzleteeen, I would.", "I'm hoping everything is going well with your diagnosis. Thank you for sharing your insight! Much appreciated!", "You might do some research on \u201clate discovery adoptees \u201c LDA, consider taking this question to the r/adoption sub and talk to some LDAs about it. It\u2019s particularly traumatizing to find out late in life that you\u2019ve been lied to your entire life by the people who you trust most. About something so fundamental,  your identity. You\u2019ll come away more informed on what your mom may feel when you tell her. Because you are going to tell her - you aren\u2019t going to be another loved one who lies to her by omission. Let the lies stop with you. And I\u2019m so very sorry your grandfather did this - he very much is the AH."]}
