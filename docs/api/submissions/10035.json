As stated, you know your financial situation the best; you get to decide these things.", "NTA, having disposable income is a luxury and spending it on the well-being of your dog is a great way to spend it", "NTA 12 hours is too long unless it\u2019s an emergency. Taking care of your dog is your responsibility feeding your girlfriend is not your responsibility. If she wants to go out for lunch, it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to treat you every once in a while.

They're not like cats, someone has to let them out to use the bathroom. And if it was habitual, they'd certainly be pretty lonely. At the very very least someone would have to check on the dog once or twice a day.\n\nThe exact amount you pay your friend is separate. Someone else pointed out that 60 over 12 hours is $5/hour, which sounds totally reasonable. You probably could find someone to do it cheaper if you really wanted to. But if you value this person specifically doing it and this is the amount you've agreed on, that's your business.", "NTA\n\n12 hours is too long for adult dogs and a younger dog needs more breaks. You could meet the GF for lunch or dinner at eachother's places instead of out. If you never go out to eat that would be a problem. You could consider a smaller timeframe for the dog sitting to pay a little less too.", "NTA. It's true that dogs can stand to be used to being on their own so if such a need arises, they're not distressed. But 12 hours is definitely too long to be alone unless it's a one-off, and even then you'd need to walk the dog a lot beforehand to make sure they're not bored and full of pent-up energy. Sounds like your girlfriend just wants you to spend less money.", "NTA your gf is controlling and borderline abusive", "NTA - but I'll say you're way overpaying your friend.  Doggy daycare on average is like $20-$30/day.  I'd either reduce the amount you pay the friend or find an alternative solution like an official doggy daycare.  Or even someone to come let the pup out a couple times a day.\n\nYour GF doesn't sound so great though, she's jealous you're spending more on the pup than you are on her.", "NTA\n\nGirlfriend is jealous of your dog. I wonder if she can hold her pee for 12 hours? Funny she feels neglected and wants the dog to feel that way instead. Maybe less lunches will help her mature?\n\nIn seriousness though, just find some less expensive or free things to do instead. Have a picnic.", "NTA re your GF, but you are an asshole for getting a dog in the first place when you're not able to give it the care it needs.", "NTA This gf may not be compatible with your life. It happens.", "If it's not temporary that's a problem though. It's not feasible long term for someone else to doing most of the care for your pet.", "NTA - you are being a responsible pet owner.", "NTA -  Keep puppy, ditch girlfriend.", "Twelve hour is too long for a puppy. Once the dog gets past 2 years or so it may be able to handle that long of a time, but it's something is built up to slowly, not sprung on the dog all at once.\n\nYou're a good pet parent; keep it up!", "NTA, but I will say most dog sitters in my area charge about $20 a day, so you may want to look into more cost effective options!", "NTA", "Most animal watchers in my area charge $25, so you are very generous, but it is your money to spend how you want. NTA", "YTA (was an ESH but i changed it after re-reading the actual questions of am I an AH for how I\u2019m raising my dog) honestly you shouldn\u2019t have gotten a pet you couldn\u2019t properly care for. Your dog spends more time with your friend than they do you their actual owner. And at one point before this was stuck home alone 12 hours a day. I\u2019m sorry for your loss but dogs are living breathing creatures not emotional support accessories. I\u2019m still wondering how a student working their way through college can afford 1200$ a month in doggy daycare.", "NTA. Dogs shouldn't be left alone that long without being let out to potty, especially puppies. Average doggie daycare where I live is $35/dog for a full day. It's so nice of your friend to help you out, but you're overpaying her. Your GF needs to mind her own business, and mark my words, she's going to turn on the dog later because it takes up to much of your time and money.", "I agree NTA. I think for their situation $60 seems fair to me because she has other dogs to take care of + a puppy now and pups are usually high energy at that age. My friend used to dog sit and that was her price for like 8 hrs .. $60 for 12 hrs is essentially $5 an hr so very reasonable to me!", "Agreed. There are many options to spend quality time with your girlfriend that are free. She sounds selfish and controlling.", "I would not trust GF to watch the puppy if she really thinks it\u2019s best to leave the puppy alone for 12 hours. Hope she never gets a dog. NTA.", "Eh, it is for some dogs and not for others.  My dog can EASILY hold her urine for 14-16 hours (she will NOT pee outside if it's raining); and when we were housebreaking her stubborn self went for 28 hours without excreting anything.", "How is OP not caring for the dog appropriately? They\u2019re putting their dog in daycare, same as you would put a child in daycare if you worked 12+ hours. The actual assholes are folks that just regularly leave their dogs for 12+ hours.", "We might assume it's \"easy\" because she isn't peeing on your floor but that doesn't mean it's actually easy, or comfortable, or sustainable. Dogs are masters at hiding pain and discomfort as both pack animals and domesticated companions.\n\nThat said, no judge: We've all had days where something happened and we didn't get home...but as a matter of practice, relying on a 12+ hour bladder just because they \"can\", that's not a pleasant day for most dogs...not to mention a virtual guarantee of early incontinence and a good number of UTIs along the way.", "Same, If it rains I cannot drag My dog out without serious effort. She really hates rain. Essy 12 hours, but she is adult. And she has company. \n\n12 hours alone for puppy? Way too much.", "I need to learn how to do this \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "What if this person is unavailable to watch him?\n\nI just think someone who is not home most of the day should not get a dog.\n\nI wanted a dog, but I live home and am out 8-9 hours a day. Even though fmy siblings are perfectly willing to stop by and walk the dog, play with it, etc, still not good enough. So I didn't get a dog.", "Not to mention it isn't sustainable. There's no way that sort of control will persist as a dog ages."]}
