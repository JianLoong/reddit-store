It\u2019s your money, you get to decide how to budget it, and there are other ways to spend time with someone other than going out to lunch.\n\nI will say, a dog shouldn\u2019t be alone for that period of time without at least being let out for a bathroom break. $60 could be generous depending on what your friend is doing - but there are also many situations where that amount is fair. As stated, you know your financial situation the best; you get to decide these things.", "NTA, having disposable income is a luxury and spending it on the well-being of your dog is a great way to spend it", "NTA 12 hours is too long unless it\u2019s an emergency. Taking care of your dog is your responsibility feeding your girlfriend is not your responsibility. If she wants to go out for lunch, it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to treat you every once in a while. You sound like a great pet parent keep it up.", "NTA $60 seems a bit high to me but it\u2019s your money.

You can not and must not leave your dog alone for 12 hours a day (or anywhere close to that time) and therefore you have managed to find a good solution for your dogs care.\n\nYou are responsible for that dog's welfare and you have seen to it that he is looked after and cared for.\n\nUnfortunately that has potentially compromised your relationship and whilst it's fine for her to want to see you more,  her expectation for you to always have money to spend on lunch is a bit of a red flag. Is your GF someone that expects you to spend money on her a lot or is it just in regards to being able to meet for lunch?", "NTA- 12 hours is too long, and I assume this is only temporary?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They're not like cats, someone has to let them out to use the bathroom. And if it was habitual, they'd certainly be pretty lonely. At the very very least someone would have to check on the dog once or twice a day.\n\nThe exact amount you pay your friend is separate. Someone else pointed out that 60 over 12 hours is $5/hour, which sounds totally reasonable. You probably could find someone to do it cheaper if you really wanted to. But if you value this person specifically doing it and this is the amount you've agreed on, that's your business.", "NTA\n\n12 hours is too long for adult dogs and a younger dog needs more breaks. You could meet the GF for lunch or dinner at eachother's places instead of out. If you never go out to eat that would be a problem. You could consider a smaller timeframe for the dog sitting to pay a little less too.", "NTA. It's true that dogs can stand to be used to being on their own so if such a need arises, they're not distressed. But 12 hours is definitely too long to be alone unless it's a one-off, and even then you'd need to walk the dog a lot beforehand to make sure they're not bored and full of pent-up energy. Sounds like your girlfriend just wants you to spend less money.", "NTA your gf is controlling and borderline abusive", "NTA - but I'll say you're way overpaying your friend.  Doggy daycare on average is like $20-$30/day.  I'd either reduce the amount you pay the friend or find an alternative solution like an official doggy daycare.  Or even someone to come let the pup out a couple times a day.\n\nYour GF doesn't sound so great though, she's jealous you're spending more on the pup than you are on her.", "NTA\n\nGirlfriend is jealous of your dog. I wonder if she can hold her pee for 12 hours? Funny she feels neglected and wants the dog to feel that way instead. Maybe less lunches will help her mature?\n\nIn seriousness though, just find some less expensive or free things to do instead. Have a picnic.", "NTA re your GF, but you are an asshole for getting a dog in the first place when you're not able to give it the care it needs.", "NTA This gf may not be compatible with your life. It happens.", "If it's not temporary that's a problem though. It's not feasible long term for someone else to doing most of the care for your pet."]}
