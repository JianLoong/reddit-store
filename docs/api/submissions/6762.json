I have a brother33 who lives near by who has 2 kids ages 6 and 9. We have a sister 26f who lives out of state. She has no children, and has came to our city to visit us. Every year she visits for the past 4 years, we always go out to eat the first night, my siblings and our children and spouses. \n\nWe always let her pick the restaurant but this time it was a crazy expensive restaurant, unreasonable prices, very fancy. My brother and I were concerned about our children coming to a place like this and asked if she was expecting us to bring the children, she said yes immediately and wants badly to see the nieces and nephews. \n\nMy brother and I looked up the restaurant some more together, and it\u2019s very pricy. There are tons of nice restaurants in the area that are reasonable prices. We are all expected to pay for our share, and including our children we would be spending at least over $240-300 (maybe even more if we didn\u2019t watch cautiously what we picked to eat) for my husband, my son and I. Which will be even more expensive for my brother and his children and wife. We don\u2019t have that kind of money to blow in a night out to eat. Plus It\u2019s a fine dining restaurant and ridiculously fancy for children. \n\nWe suggested to our sister maybe keeping the children home and then we can plan something for her and the kids to do together. She said no, she wanted them to come. So then I requested if we could do it at a cheaper restaurant and explained we can\u2019t afford to blow money on one night out. She got upset and called me an AH and said that we all work good paying jobs so we were practically rich and could afford to go out and celebrate her visiting.\n\nI am a dental hygienist and my husband works with construction, so we make a decent amount of money. My brother has an office job and his wife is a school teacher. In todays world, we are not close to being \u201crich.\u201d There are bills that need to be paid, and children that need to be fed.

This is not an unreasonable request at all. \n\nPlus I'm sorry, when you tell someone you can't afford something, it's shitty when they turn it around and get mad at you for it, throwing things in your face that isn't even true.", "NTA. \n\nIt's a reasonable request. What's unreasonable is your sister. It doesn't matter if you have good jobs- No one should dictate how your money should be spent, especially in today's economy and with children to care for... all for a single meal that is the cost of a week's worth of groceries.", "NTA. If you can't afford it, you can't afford it. Your sister can be upset all she wants, but that doesn't suddenly make you able to spend $240-300 on a single night.", "NTA.  She is.  If she wants them to come to an expensive place, she can pay", "Most definitely NTA\n\n>So then I requested if we could do it at a cheaper restaurant and explained we can\u2019t afford to blow money on one night out. She got upset and called me an AH and.....\n\nYou need to learn how to respond to thinks like this.\n\n\"Uh, uh, wow, well if that's how you feel, enjoy your dinner alone. Take care\" and you hang up.", "NTA. There are certain financial realities. I can't fault her for suggesting it, but she shouldn't be so demanding.", "NTA. Your sister is being a brat.\n\nDon\u2019t ask her if you can leave the kids at home. TELL her you will either leave the kids at home, or you guys can all compromise on a less expensive restaurant.\n\nAnd where does she get off pretending to know your finances? Sounds like she\u2019s either clueless or envious. I wouldn\u2019t accommodate that kind of comment if you don\u2019t want her to make similarly selfish demands in the future.", "NTA. I'd stand your ground on this one.", "NTA. You've explained to your sister your situation and provided a reasonable alternative, and she still called you an AH.", "NTA - your sister is being unreasonable. If she is not willing to bend on the restaurant choice all you can do is either NOT go out to dinner with her at all or leave your kid at home. She will be mad either way but you would've maintained your boundary.", "NTA. It\u2019s not fun for you if you\u2019re stressed the cost and I\u2019m sure your kids would have fun at a much less expensive restaurant.", "NTA a perfectly reasonable request, I\u2019d go as far as to pick another restaurant and book the table their outright whilst making a fuss that her neices and nephews are so happy to see her at the new restaurant. Maybe she just needs a reminder that it\u2019s more about the people who are going and not what you\u2019re eating \ud83d\udc96", "NTA. It sounds like you and your brother go out of your way to make her visits special. If she doesn\u2019t want to make accommodations for you guys, then she can pay for the kids.", "NTA your sister should be a bit more accommodating to the fact you both have kids and that's not a suitable place for you all to eat", "NTA - especially since the restaurant wouldn\u2019t work out for everyone and isn\u2019t great for kids. For that kind of money everyone involved better be having a ridiculous amount of fun.", "NTA. You would think that if you said you couldn't afford it, your sister would have chipped in the majority of the costs. That is, if she was reasonable.", "NTA, it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask for a change of venue and bringing young kids to a fine dining restaurant isn\u2019t usually the best idea. Maybe suggest a few other restaurants in your area that are nice but affordable and offer to go there instead.", "NTA. She can choose a different restaurant or do an adults dinner at the fancy place - those are two VERY reasonable alternatives.", "NTA - She's sending conflicting messages claiming her priority is to visit you both and the kids thus eating at a restaurant with a lower priced menu should be fine. Her emphasis is on her, \"...you're practically rich and could afford to go out and celebrate her visiting.\" Best to you.", "NTA. Does she realize how bored those kids will be in a place that expensive? \n\nShe's being one but you're not.", "NTA - money might be made from trees, but it damn sure doesn't grow on them. At last, this again, people with no children can be so scattered in the brain sometimes. Stand your ground sis, she'll get over it. Better yet, tell her to pay for the children's food.", "NTA if someone else is paying (you), it\u2019s polite to choose something cheaper. Doesn\u2019t matter how \u2018made\u2019 the host is. \n\nYour sister sounds like a peach.", "NTA And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she accidentally forgets to bring her wallet. You pick a restaurant, tell her when you\u2019ll be there and she\u2019s welcome to join you. She doesn\u2019t like it, tough. Ask her what\u2019s more important, food or family?", "Nta- no one goes to fine dining with a table full of kids and has a good time. It\u2019s a stupid idea that only a childless person would suggest. How about the exact opposite, go to a restaurant the KIDS will like?", "NTA: going out to dinner together with a group of people should be an occasion that suits everyone and makes everyone comfortable. not self-serving to one person. If she loves an expensive restaurant that much, she should understand what she's asking of others and do more to make it happen herself if that's what SHE wants. \n\ntell her to pound sand. (so to speak) \n\norganize something with everyone and make it happen, then invite her along if she wants to join, making it clear that everyone is paying for themselves.", "NTA. You and the brother come up with a suggested list of alternate restaurants that are more \"family friendly\", and let your sister choose. \n\nIf she's not willing to choose a restaurant that works for the extended family, then she doesn't want to see the extended family.", "NTA\nBut your sister kind of is", "NTA, NTA. NTA\nIt's your money. Even if you could technically spend that money, it's still a ridiculous amount. Your sister is unreasonable in expecting you to just suck it up.", "NTA. \n\nIt is unreasonable to expect you and your brother to be able to fork out such a significant amount for a meal that your kids likely won't even enjoy. \n\nIf going to that restaurant means so much to her then she should have gone for your very reasonable suggestion that you went without the kids and did something separately with them.", "NTA!\n\nWhat in the effing F?? Your 26-yo sister is definitely a controlling person (ergo, the AH here).\n\nWhy are you even being this nice to her? I mean, if you guys are scratching this place off the list, you simply let her know and end of discussion. She doesn't get to decide for everyone; this should be something to be agreed on by everyone, not be imposed by a single person.", "Tell her pick another restaurant or offer to cook dinner at home. NTA", "NTA - Just tell her while you and your brother make decent money, raising a family is extremely expensive.   You can't afford the place she picked, so she needs to pick another one.   Maybe offer her some suggestions for reasonable places so she's not left guessing.   \n\nMake it clear though if she doesn't pick somewhere affordable, you'll have to cancel.", "NTA. Your sister doesn't seem to factor in that children cost an insane amount of money and so does everything else right now. Not to mention, there are plenty of people at those kinds of restaurants that go for a quiet intimate experience and wouldn't want kids around. Your sister sounds like the AH and she needs to think about others instead of just herself.", "NTA. She's being imposing, and the money is certainly an issue. Although I could spend $100/person on a meal, I refuse to dine anywhere that charges more than $40/person for an entree, because it's just unreasonable. People have different comfort levels around spending money on luxuries, and your sister should have asked before assuming you'd all be comfortable at an especially high-priced restaurant.", "Nta  fancy restaurants suck. \nMy husband and I went to an expensive one we were both curious about for our anniversary. We were both so disappointed and still hungry after", "INFO:\n\nIs it expensive for your sister to come visit you every year?", "NTA regardless of what your incomes are, she isn't accounting for your expenditures of being a parent. Kids are expensive & for her to state because you make $$ that you can afford to splurge THAT much is insulting. If she were treating the lot, it'd be one thing but she doesn't get to dictate how much each family has for discretionary spending; hell, $240-300 is a grocery budget for some people.", "NTA. If she really wants to go to that specific restaurant she can go with only adults. If she insists the kids go, she picks a cheaper restaurant. \n\nI would let her know $300+ for something that isn't an emergency isn't in my budget this month and we won't be attending at all.", "I've always gotten annoyed when a childless person claims to know what a couple with kids can afford. You're NTA. Besides the cost of the check for the evening, whether you take kids to an expensive restaurant or pay a babysitter, the other issue is whether the evening is going to be pleasant for the kids. My kids were well behaved but I certainly wouldn't put us through the stress of taking them to a really nice place that means a quiet atmosphere and a long experience. Your sister needs to learn that wanting a group outing means being understanding of the needs and cost for the entire group.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
