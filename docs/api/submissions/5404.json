He speaks okay, but is more comfortable in Spanish. I\u2019ll explain the relevance. \nNow Jose is what you would describe as a papi chulo. He\u2019s very handsome, funny and most girls like him. We have a lil flirting between us but nothing serious. He\u2019s very flirtatious.\nRecently, a new girl started, she keeps to herself mostly but she caught his attention. This usually happens and than he loses interest but the past few months he\u2019s been stuck on her. Constantly, she\u2019s pretty, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s smart, this and that. Doesn\u2019t flirt or go after girls anymore. He swears he likes her a lot.\nThey went on a date and he said they\u2019re talking and he thinks it can be serious. The thing is she is Puerto Rican but her Spanish is very limited, not fluent. And his English is very limited, not fluent. So I told him he can\u2019t be with a girl who can\u2019t even really speak to him or his family if it got serious. She sat with us once or twice and she just smiled and laughed, spoke a few words of broken Spanish, she just couldn\u2019t keep up with us. \nHe said they have good chemistry and they\u2019re trying to teach each other. But I said why not have a relationship where it\u2019s easier and more natural with a similar culture. There\u2019s plenty of beautiful Dominican women we work with. Now he says I\u2019m unsupportive and negative and hasn\u2019t spoken to me and no longer sits with our friend group. He just sits with that girl. Our friends are divided, some say they don\u2019t understand their relationship either but others say she\u2019s a nice girl and we should help her with her Spanish if he likes her.

Either way, you don't have an opinion there because it is not your relationship. Unless you see any real red flag somewhere, your intervention isn't necessary or valued.

He's not erasing his identity or threatening your culture by flirting with another girl, just admit you're jealous and get some therapy.", "You\u2019re making his life harder not minding your business.", "Why is his life hard now?", "You think being fluent in english would make his life harder??", "So you don\u2019t see any positives in him improving his English language skills? Or know if he has the interest to do so? \n\nAnd you can\u2019t imagine his crush wanting to improve her Spanish? And that\u2019s impossible for her to improve to the point where she can communicate with everyone \u201cin his life\u201d.\n\nYTA. Because both parties can improve their respective language skills as they get to know each other.", "By picking and choosing who his girlfriends are, you\u2019re making his life harder.", "Sorry..  who are you again? This is not your life. Scram.", "About 50% of my family speaks only Spanish. I've never even considered that I would only date men who speak Spanish. My boyfriend doesn't speak a lick of Spanish. My grandfather doesn't speak any English. They love each other lol.", "You\u2019re actively making his life harder though by being difficult for no reason", "Same. I speak zero Spanish and totally understood the above with ease. It\u2019s not about the language. It\u2019s about jealousy and racism.", "You have admitted that you have this fantasy in your head that he\u2019s going to marry a Dominican woman.  You have decided FOR him that he won\u2019t marry anyone else but the kind of woman that YOU want him to.  I mean, technically, Dominican ISN\u2019T a race, but for all intents and purposes, that is a racist attitude.  And controlling, as well.", "And ignorant too", "hispanic is not a race.", "Lmao actually caring about people does make people change their ways. They stop flirting with random ass people who don\u2019t mean shit to them when they find somebody they want to be with. Just because he didn\u2019t change for you or some other woman he flirted with doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t for this woman. You\u2019re a shitty ass friend and a shitty ass person. It\u2019s fucking pathetic \ud83d\ude02", "Sounds like you\u2019re upset she did what you couldn\u2019t do and that\u2019s keep his attention. Get over yourself", "Dang such low faith in your ex-friend", "Petty as hell", "Wow you really wanna die on this hill and not save this friendship don\u2019t you?", "I\u2019m only 28 and I look great for my age, he had fun flirting and than she showed up. Like I said he is that way and I guess she\u2019ll figure it out when the next gringa comes to take him.", "If she never learned to speak Spanish that\u2019s on her parents. My mom is from PR & my dad is Italian (he speaks both Italian & Spanish).  My sister & I never learned Spanish or Italian at home. What I did learn was from my PR Abuela and my Italian Nonna & Nonno, who could understand English but not speak it. Is it sad? Maybe. But it is what it is. It doesn\u2019t make me less than because I can\u2019t converse in Spanish or Italian just like it doesn\u2019t make her less than for the same reason.", "Its so ugly when people still try to continue that stupid Dominican vs Puerto Rican thing. Both places were colonized and brutalized. Have some Hispanic solidarity instead of talking down on fellow Caribbean Latinos", "Yep Love knows no language other than love.", "Especially when she\u2019s already making the effort to get better at it!", "I felt this", "She thinks he\u2019s fucking around with American girls for fun but he\u2019ll settle down with a Dominican wife", "I mean learning it will be hard. I can already see he is struggling.", "I know someone that is Columbian and she absolutely hates her neighbor because she's Dominican, that's literally the only she hates her neighbor. So OP is definitely being racist/prejudice.", "Jealousy isn\u2019t a good look", "Lol make up your mind you call this girl a gringa and American in some comments but then insist you can\u2018t be racist against her bc you\u2018re both hispanic in others", "I\u2019ve been reading these comments from you, OP and it\u2019s super embarrassing. \u201cI\u2019m not racist\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not jealous\u201d \u201cI look good for my age\u201d\u2026 who are you trying to convince? You asked for an answer and the thread gave it to you: you\u2019re a massive, jealous AH.", "How is she a gringa if she\u2019s Puerto Rican?", "You had fun flirting and then she showed up**", "Lol you\u2019re deluded", "Yikes girl", "How are you not embarrassed by your pathetic attempt to ruin a relationship? This is seriously embarrassing behavior by a grown woman who can't  control her jealousy and bigotry. The solution here would be *grow up*. YTA", "So just because something is hard, that means he should give up or not even try?", "INFO: do y\u2019all live in America? If you do, your advice is absolute crap, and you\u2019ve got crabs in a bucket mentality. If he doesn\u2019t get a good grasp of English, his earning potential **will** be limited. And here, income is directly related to health, education, opportunity, wealth attainment, etc. \n\nI came from Latin America and the notion of not even learning English fluently wouldn\u2019t even cross my mind.", "He wants to keep learning and developing himself as a person. It's admirable that he's willing to learn and putting himself in uncomfortable situations. \n\nHe could stick with what he knows, but it seems like he's found something else which makes him happy. And that is what actually matters here - his happiness.", "It\u2019s so much easier if you\u2019re immersed in it though, so learning English will actually come fairly easily as compared to trying to just study it, just like learning Spanish will for the girl he\u2019s seeing.\n\nSorry he didn\u2019t choose you like you clearly wanted, but for the love of all that is guacamole can you stop pretending like your opinion matters AT ALL? You\u2019re not family, he\u2019s distancing you as a friend, and you\u2019re a xenophobic AH. His life, his choice, end of f*cking story. I\u2019m Brazilian, my bf is Guatemalan, and you know what his family and friends did? *Accept me with open arms and help me learn Spanish because they\u2019re nice people.* Try being one someday; it\u2019s a lot less exhausting. YTA", "It can also mean any foreigner"]}
