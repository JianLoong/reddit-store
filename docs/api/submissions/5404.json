He speaks okay, but is more comfortable in Spanish. I\u2019ll explain the relevance. \nNow Jose is what you would describe as a papi chulo. He\u2019s very handsome, funny and most girls like him. We have a lil flirting between us but nothing serious. He\u2019s very flirtatious.\nRecently, a new girl started, she keeps to herself mostly but she caught his attention. This usually happens and than he loses interest but the past few months he\u2019s been stuck on her. Constantly, she\u2019s pretty, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s smart, this and that. Doesn\u2019t flirt or go after girls anymore. He swears he likes her a lot.\nThey went on a date and he said they\u2019re talking and he thinks it can be serious. The thing is she is Puerto Rican but her Spanish is very limited, not fluent. And his English is very limited, not fluent. So I told him he can\u2019t be with a girl who can\u2019t even really speak to him or his family if it got serious. She sat with us once or twice and she just smiled and laughed, spoke a few words of broken Spanish, she just couldn\u2019t keep up with us. \nHe said they have good chemistry and they\u2019re trying to teach each other. But I said why not have a relationship where it\u2019s easier and more natural with a similar culture. There\u2019s plenty of beautiful Dominican women we work with. Now he says I\u2019m unsupportive and negative and hasn\u2019t spoken to me and no longer sits with our friend group. He just sits with that girl. Our friends are divided, some say they don\u2019t understand their relationship either but others say she\u2019s a nice girl and we should help her with her Spanish if he likes her.

Either way, you don't have an opinion there because it is not your relationship. Unless you see any real red flag somewhere, your intervention isn't necessary or valued.
