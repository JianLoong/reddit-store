(I\u2019m 28, we are like a cross between sisters and a mother-daughter type relationship.) My older sister (I\u2019ll call her Anna) is honestly a very emotionally distant mom, she doesn\u2019t act warm or loving to my niece (although she has not been neglectful or abusive at all). She is very invested in her career and didn\u2019t want children from when we were young, Ella was an accidental pregnancy. \n\nThe other day, Ella was feeling sad because she\u2019s been fighting with her friends, and she called me to talk. She said that she\u2019d tried to talk to her mom but Anna told her that she was busy and didn\u2019t have time to listen to her whine. And Ella asked me why her mom didn\u2019t seem to want her. This caught me by surprise and I just answered without thinking, I said that Anna didn\u2019t actually want children. \n\nElla wasn\u2019t even surprised though. She just said \u201cokay\u201d, like I just confirmed what she thought all along. But then my sister called me and was really angry that I said that. She said I was trying to screw up her relationship with her daughter and that she was a good mom, so I didn\u2019t have a right to say such things. But it\u2019s true. Anyways, AITA? What I said probably hurt my niece, but she knows I didn\u2019t say it unkindly and that I was just telling the truth. The only person really upset with me is my sister. So am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: My niece has actually asked this before, and I gave an evasive answer that she saw through in a second. So I guess I felt like she deserved some honesty, because she\u2019s been beating herself up about not being good enough to be loved- and it\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s her mom\u2019s, so I said so. I think word for word I said something like \u201cyour mom never really wanted to have children when we were younger\u2026 so she does love you, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever be the best at the emotional support, and the things moms are supposed to do.\u201d", "created_utc": 1691595244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mimz0/aita_for_telling_my_niece_that_her_mom_didnt_want/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

True or not.", "Massive YTA.", "NTA\n\nI'm sure it was difficult for Ella to hear. \n\nHere's the thing that many people are missing about why you did her a huge solid; Ella can stop blaming herself for her mother's inadequacies. Kids need to be told when shit their parents do or don't do isn't their fault. \n\nContinue being a loving support system for Ella. It's possible that when Ella is an adult, Anna will be able to relate to her better.

She's not meeting her emotional needs.", "YTA, regardless of how bad their relationship is and how much you thought you might be helping, it is NOT YOUR PLACE to share information like this.  What good do you think it will do?\n\nYou need to profusely apologize to both of them asap.", "Yta that\u2019s a terrible thing to tell a teenager.", "YTA. You don\u2019t tell children that their parents didn\u2019t want them. Maybe it makes you feel better because you think you are right, but it just makes you an asshole.", "YTA. What's the benefit of telling her? You think she'll feel better about her mother being standoffish and unemotional with the knowledge she didn't want children in the first place?\n\nThe answer is this: \"Your mom loves you. She's not great at showing it, and I know that hurts. It's not fair to you at all. But there's nothing about *you* that makes her that way, and *I* love you very much.", "NTA. My mom informed me she had never wanted kids, and only had me at the request of her dying mother, at the ripe old age of 5 years old. She would brag about this fact to me. Its better for your neice to know so she won't think there is something wrong with her. You gave her the tools she needed to make an informed decision on how to interact with her mother. She now knows her mother will not support her emotionally, and now she can seek that elsewhere (probably from you).", "Hurts a lot less than her realizing it herself one day, or worse, her mother eventually telling her.\n\nSauce; I was told by my mom that the only reason I exist is because my dad wanted kids, and how she's happy she has a way to hurt him by withholding contact. She was stone cold sober btw.", "YTA don't say this to a kid. Ugh. It should be \"talk to your mom about your feelings\". It may have been the truth as you see it, but it isn't your truth to tell. Maybe your sister did never want children, but she kept her daughter, meaning--regardless of what she told you, she wanted her daughter. Maybe your sister isn't able to express emotions in a typical way, it doesn't mean she doesn't want her kid. Yeesh. You've done some damage to people you love. I totally believe it was accidental but dang...you should apologize to your sister.", "YTA.\n\nSounds to me like you like being the cool aunt. Maybe instead of patting yourself on the back about how awesome you are, you can put some of that energy into supporting your nieces relationship with her mom.\n\nNo matter how good of an aunt you are, your niece is going to benefit the most from a strong relationship with her mother.\n\nSounds like you sister isn\u2019t the kind of mother that you think she should be, but not all mothers are the same.", "YTA. That\u2019s life-changing, trauma-inducing news right there. You\u2019re supposedly the adult here. You can\u2019t take back what you said, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can rationalize that she didn\u2019t seem surprised, so what you said had no effect.", "When I was about 15 or so, my aunt told me I wasn't wanted and my mom wanted to actually have an abortion but my grandma (dad's mom) convinced her not to go through with it. It explained a lot of things regarding my relationship with my mom but it also created a lot of my own issues and I have definitely developed a complex.", "Wtf man, you don't even know if Anna loves her. Some parents used to think they didn't want kids until they had a baby, and now Ella is gonna think she's unloved. YTA, and saying without thinking isn't an excuse.", "YTA. It's scary that you thought it was acceptable to say this to a teenager. You are going to cause actual psychological harm by saying shit like this. Also: if your sister truly 100% didn't want to become a mother, she could have had an abortion. She didn't. She chose to become a parent.\n\nYou're also full of shit. Originally you wrote that you said it without thinking, then edit to say she'd asked before and thought she deserved honesty. You did this purposefully, either because you actually didn't realize how awful this was to say out loud, or wanted to hurt your sister's relationship with her daughter even more.", "YTA. There are ZERO circumstances that would ever make telling your niece that your sister didn\u2019t want her appropriate. Zero. Automatically makes you a bad aunt. Your niece might not seem upset to you but she\u2019s most likely heartbroken permanently. Because of you. What a sad person you must be that you did that and still think you\u2019re in the right.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou acted without thinking - regardless if Ella had brought this up before, she's still only a child and you need to consider the ramifications of what you're telling her. It's great that you're there for your niece and filling in the emotional support her own mother can't handle but what you said isn't going to help. \n\nWhat upsets me the most though is Anna calling you, after she said she was too busy to listen to Ella's whining, to whine to you about this. Truthfully, if Anna was more present in her own daughter's life this entire situation wouldn't have happened. Anna needs to step up here and be a Mom, I cannot imagine what Ella must be feeling and thinking to even want to ask you this question in the first place. I'd be calling her back to tear her a new one.", "YTA, big time you crossed the line. Have no business to interfere with that relationship.  You have caused and created a big damage in several relationships.", "YTA. Just because you believe it to be the truth doesn't make it the truth. In reality, you have no idea how Anna really feels about Ella or being a mother. She might have said some unguarded things at some point, but you're wrong to use that as evidence of anything. What you did was really bad. Ella did not need to hear anything like that and you have no business interfering in the relationship between a parent and child based on what you reckon.\n\nYou're 28 years old. I'd expect more sensitivity and diplomacy from my eight year old.", "Just because it's true and you didn't say it in a mean tone doesn't mean it wasn't incredibly hurtful. You crushed any ounce of hope that child had that her mother loves and cares about her. \n\nYou need to think before you speak. \n\nYTA", "YTA I don't think you should have said that.  \n\nYou should have said something vague and turned the conversation back to listening to your niece.  \n\nShe needs someone to listen.  She does not need to hear that her mother didn't want her.", "You should have maybe ended it with something along the lines of \"I'll always be here for you or I got your back\" type of thing even though it would have made her mother look worse.  When you go this route and admit to something like this, you definitely need to reaffirm an unwavering support.", "NTA: I hope you said it in an incredibly kind way. At 14 she needed to know that it isn't her fault, but rather that your sister is the one at fault. I'll never understand why women have children that they can't love properly.", "NTA\u2026HOWEVER, you will need to help revisit this with your niece over time. I know you will get dinged by others here, but what is true is true. Better ways to tell it both in substance and timing? Sure. But your niece and sister are not strangers and sooner or later this will come out. The compensation, if there is any, is that now the three of you will have time to get this right. So, again NTA, but you have lots of work to do. I wish you well.", "NTA. Anna shouldn\u2019t have dismissed her child when she was going through something like that. We\u2019re all busy - I know. But seems like Ella\u2019s mother has done this enough to strain their relationship. Her response of \u201cokay\u201d shows she wasn\u2019t thinking anything differently anyhow. As a young adult now, would\u2019ve wanted to know something like that as a teen in order to have a better understanding of my relationship with her and take that information to make it grow. Otherwise, she\u2019d probably just keep questioning herself.", "YTA\n\nYou don't tell a kid that kind of info especially \"without thinking\". I will say that it looks like the mom should be more caring toward her daughter. However you are in no right to give that kind of info to your niece. You could've found a way to avoid the question. Your actions could have definitely affected their mother-daughter relationship", "YTA\n\nYou had other options. \n\n\n\nYou could have said you didn't know what was happening and you would have a conversation with your sister.  And then have an open conversation, tell your concerns for your nieces mental health, that she feels rejected, and so on. \n\nYou could have suggested therapy. Family therapy. Counseling for your niece. Whatever. You yourself could have talked to a professional  before putting such a burden on a teenager to carry the rest of her life. \n\nYou had no right to tell your niece this, because it wasn't your story to tell. It does not make anything better, it doesn't help, it only benefits yourself and I think you know that. You get to be the \"truthful, best friend aunt\" even though you just hurt her and your sister. \n\nIf you truly wanted to help, you would have given your sister the benefit of the doubt and help her see her mistakes, so that she could have a better relationship with her daughter.", "Probably YTA. No one needs to hear their moms didn\u2019t want them. I grew up knowing my mom never actually wanted kids (she told us- not in a mean way but in a matter of fact way) and she always used to follow it up with but my kids ended up being the joy of my life, I\u2019m happy I did, bla bla bla I mean. She looks back with rose tinted glasses. She didn\u2019t want kids. She was frustrated all the time, we were work for her. Was depressed and had to sleep most of the time. And now In our 30s we are all pretty well cut off from her and she resents us again. \n\nI don\u2019t want kids. But if I happened to have a kid and they asked I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say I had never wanted kids or I wasn\u2019t the type of have kids or that it had never been a calling. I think id choose to tell them I struggle with balancing all the pulls of life. Finding time for my own care, my career and how much time I want to give them. I\u2019d say in my perfect world I\u2019d give them every minute and be everything I possibly could and would be happy and we\u2019d have an easy life. And I\u2019d say it frustrates me too that it\u2019s never perfect. Id assure them that I love them. And that we can try to make a plan to have more one on one. What I\u2019m saying is \u2026.. if I had kids, I\u2019d be the mom who never wanted them. But over my dead body would I ever tell them that. I\u2019d want to shape it the best I could. And I\u2019d be beyond angry if someone else interfered with that narrative. \n\nYou\u2019re sister needs to do better.

The fact that her mom was too busy to answer may or may not have anything to do with her not wanting kids at one time. Not wanting and then ending up with kids doesn't mean you do not love your children. There are plenty of parents who have always wanted kids but fail to show up at different moments. You asserting that this is the answer is truly problematic because it assumes that the mother not being present is connected with at one time not having kids. Maybe? But that's an unfair to say to your niece about your sister. Think of the difference of these statements \"your mom never wanted kids\" or \"your mom is sort of obtuse. It might be a good idea and go talk to her.\" \n\nInstead of potentially helping facilitate a conversation that could bring them closer you shit on your sister and confirmed a deep fear of your nieces.", "YTA and it's not even a debate. First of all, you left her with that answer and didn't continue on with a discussion with her about it. You dropped a bomb and walked away without making sure she could handle it. It may have been something she needed to hear, as others have said, but leaving her with that disheartening response of \"Okay\" and not trying to help her explore how she felt and how to process the revelation is a dick move.\n\n\nAlso there's probably nuance to what's actually going on which your answer didn't entirely convey, and so it's justifiable why your sister is mad at you for putting the thought in your niece's head that she is \"unwanted\" when, even by your own admission, your sister is not abusive or neglectful, just busy with work, which is a means of providing for her family and potentially a source of great stress for her. There's not enough detail to really dig into what's actually going on, but I can see how being someone who is swamped with work and not good with emotion in general can lead to her seeming emotionally distant. That doesn't mean that she doesn't love or want her daughter, just that she's too busy and not equipped to be the \"ideal mom\", which frankly many mothers aren't. That doesn't mean that they don't love their children, they just have human shortcomings, as we all do, and so while your sister should make an effort now and then to reassure her daughter that she's loved and cared for, she needs to be clear that she has those failings and won't always be prepared or available to live up to a TV show's interpretation of what a mother should be.\n\n\nPersonally I think you owe your sister and niece an apology and should explain that you answered the question on the basis of information you had about your sister 14+ years ago. Not wanting children doesn't disqualify someone from still loving their kids once they're born, and not being an \"ideal mother\" doesn't mean that they don't love their children. She may suck at expressing those feelings and living up to a standard of mothering that wasn't designed for people like her, but to reach the conclusion that she doesn't love her daughter from those shortcomings is horseshit, especially if you've never had a one-on-one candid discussion with your sister about how she really feels and are just interpreting things from your own limited perspective.", "Yes, YTA.

She also learned a bit to trust her instincts and trust experience when dealing with relationships rather than searching for ways to get approval.", "Exactly. Sometimes the truth hurts, that's life. Ultimately she's better off knowing the truth than blaming herself.", "Saying \"she's not good at emotional support\" is not at all like the thing you said. It's not invalidating her feelings, it's telling her \"your reasons for feeling this way are real, your mom is doing a bad job of showing love, it's her fault not yours\".\n\nThrowing in \"your mom does love you though\" doesn't invalidate the rest of her feelings, a kid doesn't need to be told they're unwanted.", "You are doing wonderfully. Don't worry. You're okay my love.", "You tell your sister her kid is asking these questions and push for them to go to therapy.  You don\u2019t confirm the worst possible interpretation of a situation to a vulnerable 14 year old when you have no idea if that is true.\n\nMother daughter relationships in mid to late teens are difficult to navigate in the best of situations.", "I see your point, but not adding on more doubt and pain on top of it might be a good start ?", "Often people ask questions in the hopes of being proven wrong about a suspicion. Also, just because the mother has poor emotional attunement, it doesn't mean that she doesn't currently want or love her daughter. Based on the lack of emotional attunement from OP to her niece I am guessing it is a family dynamic.", "Telling an already emotional 14-year-old girl that her mother didn't want her is the opposite of what you should do if you're an adult. Maybe she didn't want children before she got pregnant, but that doesn't mean she doesn't want the child she has. What this girl heard was, \"Your mom never wanted you, and she doesn't like you now because you ruined her life.\"", "Doesn\u2019t have to be either of the two extremes", "No. But you approach it with more empathy and encourage communication. You tell her how much you love her, and that no mom is perfect. You talk with your sister about how your niece is feeling. \n\nOther thing to note: the daughter was a)upset enough to go to her mother, b) sought comfort for her mother, and c) the idea that someone was telling her daughter that Anna didn't want her made her angry enough to call her sister. This dynamic isn't simple, and OP boiled it down to the detriment of everyone.", "It messes a child up when their mother doesn't want them. Mothers are supposed to be this unwaivering center of stability & love, & when a kid doesn't get that they blame themselves. \"If my own mother, who is biologically programmed to love me, can't, then no one can\". I know that because I said it to myself plenty of times.", "It\u2019s not helpful when it\u2019s not the proper therapy dynamic to help the minor. You\u2019re not the only one with mom problems.", "Having it conformed that your mother never wanted you even still doesn't is devastating Aunty just damaged nice more then mom would have if aunts had kept her mouth shut.", "yeah but that's still for the mom to say and for the mom to fix. If the aunt is worried, she should bring it up with her sister, not say something that could be permanently damaging. What if the mom loves her immensely now but has never been good at expressing it or being a role model mom. Moms are human too you know. It's not like she's being abusive, maybe she just needs an honest conversation with her daughter.", "Believe me, she'd rather not have the confirmation.", "You don't stop wanting something or trying for something like that because someone tells you that you can't have it. It's not a switch you can flip. So she just gets to carry more hurt.", "Isn't this exactly what OP did? Your mom never wanted kids, but she had you, so now she hates you. Totally better.", "We have no idea if this is true based on OP\u2019s original statement.  We get OP\u2019s general impressions and inferences, not what the niece\u2019s mother actually thinks.", "It was a relief to finally hear it confirmed by my family that I was the least favorite of all my Grandma's grandchildren. (Hyperactive and a bit gender non-conforming especially when I was little and I think that was the part that annoyed her most tbh.) I already knew but my mother's reassured me I was just in my head and she didn't treat me different. Basically she gas lit me. At Grandma's funeral I mentioned it to my cousins (there's a lot of us, big Latino family) they all confirmed it, we laughed, we cried and more than anything I learned not to trust my mom's words. I still love my Grandma. I miss her. She was funny. She put a lot of work to keeping the family together which I appreciated. She just didn't like me and I wasn't an easy child.", "I would say the response is age appropriate and understanding of both parties!!!!!!!!", "[removed]", "I literally had the exact same thought at that point, just instantly what relationship? Good luck op nta. She deserved to know and mom needed to be called out this is absolutely emotional neglect. Your niece will likely need your support now.", "> As a kid who everyone in my family told me \"your mother should have never had kids\" even if I agreed, I found it absolutely whack they said things like that to me.\n\nSounds like you weren't asking for their opinion. That's a very different situation.", "She hasn't been stressed with work for fourteen years, though. I don't think there's any good excuse that covers that amount of time being emotionally neglected. Now OP's niece knows there's someone in her life she can trust to give her the truth. I imagine she'll go to OP about more things in the future since there is that trust now. And good - it sounds like her mother doesn't deserve her trust.", "Something like this was already set in stone. Better to acknowledge the stone and learn the best ways to move past it than to unknowingly run into it headfirst over and over again, always getting hurt but not fully understanding why.", "Or perhaps it could be a wakeup call for OP's sister is repeatedly seeing behavior in her and getting responses from her that have her asking trusted relatives if she's unwanted and unloved, and the stone elephant finally acknowleged.", "and that's a bad thing because? I'd rather have confirmation that something is true than go around wondering about it for the rest of my life", "And? So it\u2019s \u2018set in stone\u2019. How is that inherently an issue?", "Something like this that the niece was already not surprised by the answer and has asked this question more than once, seems like it is already in stone.\n\nSometimes living in a state of perpetual unease and agony because you aren't 100% sure and you think you might just be going crazy is 100% worse than living with a hurtful truth.", "OP edited and I would say the response is age appropriate and understanding of both parties.", "I can agree depending on the age. At 14 I wouldn't have taken it as offensive but everybody is different", "She also learned that while she knew she had a safe adult in her corner who wanted to protect her feelings (Kid had asked before and OP had hedged), she has someone also capable of being honest with her. An adult like that can be immeasurably affirming, especially for a kid of 14 who isn't finding that at home.", "And not growing up distrusting her instincts about people.", "But we don't know if it is the truth! That's the sick part. It sounds like both OP and her sister struggle with emotional attunement.", "As an unwanted kid, I can tell you that they know anyways and it is incredibly validating to have another adult know what your parent is like.", "And it is always more complex than that! The mom's behavior is the mom's. \"she never wanted to have kids\" puts it on the niece. It's an underdeveloped- brain quick skip to \"I am unlovable.\"", "Literally not what OP said. Stop projecting.", ">What this girl heard was, \"Your mom never wanted you, and she doesn't like you now because you ruined her life.\"\n\nSays who?", "No, but telling a not quite true version of reality will be just as damaging to the kid.", "Noo, I\u2019m not messed up anymore!        I did therapy, and worked on it.    I found the proper love and support like their niece.    I had an adult who provided love and support when I needed it. \nI own a successful business, and it\u2019s another reason my mother resents me\u2026. \n\nYou are also not messed up.   Some people don\u2019t have the capability to love, have feelings or be emotional supportive. (Antisocial disorder)\nI am sorry you think you are unlovable. You very much so are.  And you deserve to be happy and loved. \nYour mother has issues of her own that do not define you, they do not stop you from being you or who you are.  \nNo one is biologically programmed to love. I know a couple mothers who outright say \u201c I do not feel the connection, but I love her \u201c", "But we don't know that the mother doesn't love or want the daughter. We know at one time she didn't want kids. There are plenty of people who are not emotionally attuned to their kids but still love them deeply.", "There\u2019s no way I wanted to hear that from a therapist. \nWhen I was told I was in therapy\u2026.. you don\u2019t know anyone\u2019s situation.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be.    It was at the time. And sometimes it stings, but I healed. No choice but to just like their niece.     \n\n\nI talked with someone and they fixed the issue.  My mother did NOT.     I was sat down by a cousin and explained that sometimes, mothers just can\u2019t. Especially when there\u2019s other factors. Career, addiction or mental health.", "My mother screamed it at me. And likes to remind me. \nNot all mothers can. \nWhy does everyone thing being a mom is a super power?! \nTHEY ARE HUMAN TOO.", "Yes! It could be such a great moment that could bring them closer. Clearly the daughter was upset. She went to her mother, and my guess is that the mother was upset because of the pain her daughter felt because...SHE IMPERFECTLY LOVES HER KID", "That's exactly what op did !", "i agree a phone call was not and is never the best option, but sometimes its inevitable that information will slip out\u2026 and if it comes out in a form of consolation to Ella, then in my very honest opinion\u2026 no harm no foul. the harm was already there when Ella asked OP why her mom didnt want her due what i assume is constant dismissal bc i highly doubt a one-off wouldve caused uncertainty in a child that their mother doesnt want them. OP answered truthfully bc she didnt want to be another adult that lies Ella.", "She called her aunt because her mom told her she was \"too busy to listen to her whine.\" \n\nSpeaking facts is not manipulation. And OP was right, her niece was was expressing that it was her own short comings that were preventing her from being loved by her mom and she reassured her niece there was nothing wrong with her, her mom is the problem. OP didn't create those feelings in her niece, the niece had already been sharing these feelings with OP for a while, and OPs niece is plenty old enough to be presented with hard truths. OPs sister never wanted kids, and from the post it seems that the niece is the sisters only child, and *IF* that's the case, OPs sister probably lowkey harbors some resentment towards her daughter for deciding to keep her in the first place, which would not allow her to connect with her daughter emotionally.", "She\u2019s 14.", "She\u2019s 14. She\u2019s not an adult.", "Not in the least. That was a really ungentle way of telling a kid that their own parent didn\u2019t want them.", "Do you have an emotionally absent mother", "This is also a very good point. When everyone dodges and/or dismisses your questions and concerns you wonder if you can even trust yourself. \n\n\"Are my senses off? This guy seems creepy, it's probably just me though, I'm not a good judge of character.\" \n\n\"Is my partner lying to me? Probably not, I'm can never tell when someone is telling the truth or not. My mom acts like this all the time and she says she loves me, I guess this is just normal behavior.\"", "Not projecting. I was a 14 year old girl once, though. OP said she was emotional and crying. Telling her that her mother never wanted her only makes it worse, whether you like it or not.", "Psychology", "As someone else stated, Psychology. Also, I was a 14 year old girl once myself. I know how we think and can take things that are said to us.", "Absolutely nowhere did op blame niece for being born. She clarified mum didn't want kids. There is a world of difference and the leap you made there would be impressive to a kangaroo", "She's not a baby anymore either. She can tell that her mother isn't interested in her. What good is another adult telling her otherwise do when she can tell somethings wrong?", "So isn't it a good thing to know it's not her fault somehow that her mom doesn't live her or at least can't show it in certain ways? Because the alternative would be letting her go on wondering about the reason for the somewhat estranged/cold relationship at best, and blaming herself at worst which would be hell on her self esteem.", "Exactly why it\u2019s important for her to know that her mothers treatment of her is not her fault (because that\u2019s how kids think). Now she can understand why her mother isn\u2019t there for her. It might hurt like hell, but at least she won\u2019t grow up believing she\u2019s unlovable. \n\nI wish I had known that my mom was mentally unwell when I was a kid. Instead I tried like hell to get her to accept me and love me, while internalizing all the emotional and physical abuse she doled out. I\u2019ve been working through its effect on my self concept for years.", "Exactly, and she seems to be well aware about how her mom doesn't like her. All OP did here is 1) confirm that indeed, that is the case, and 2) this is NOT the kid's fault, which is probably what she was thinking, but rather it's the mom's.", "She may be 14 but she doesn't sound like an idiot.  Everyone goes around saying \"when someone shows you who they are, believe them\".  She just wanted confirmation about something she already knows.", "And per the update, she thought that there was something wrong with her.  I'd say it's better to have the truth that there is nothing wrong with her.\n\nI don't think I'd have said something like that, but I'm not in her aunt's shoes.  I don't think we have enough info to say whether it was right or wrong.", "Pray do tell how it should\u2019ve gone. This way shows the the child is not at fault and that mom has some areas that she isn\u2019t the best in.", "I dont know if absent is the right word, but stable isn't the right word either. As I said everyone is different. I'm just saying that as a 14 year old, I would have been able to understand the difference between the 2 statements. But that's me and my experience. Not saying it's anyone else's", "EXACTLY!", "I agree, but (sorry of the reddit but) we don't know that she is telling her the truth. We don't know the mother doesn't want her. OP doesn't know that. She threw out an answer instead of validating the nieces feelings and exploring how to open up some communication between the daughter and mother. \n\nThere are so many more options than saying this hurtful thing and not saying anything at all!", "So you are glossing over the rest of the post to make your decision instead?", "\"Every single girl in the world thinks exactly like me\" - Psychology", "It's better for her to have confirmation than constantly beating herself up and wonder what she's doing wrong.  That, I think, would be way more cruel and damaging to a 14 year old.", "Well they could have made it perfectly clear that the kid is definitely loved and wanted by the rest of the family.  You can be honest and soften the blow at the same time.", "Please, show me where OP said she actually helped her niece.", "Nah. You're just assuming now. It's actually very basic Psychology that, if you tell a child that their parent never wanted them, that they'll think their parent doesn't like or want them. Kids are very basic in that way."]}
