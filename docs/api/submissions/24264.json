(I\u2019m 28, we are like a cross between sisters and a mother-daughter type relationship.) My older sister (I\u2019ll call her Anna) is honestly a very emotionally distant mom, she doesn\u2019t act warm or loving to my niece (although she has not been neglectful or abusive at all). She is very invested in her career and didn\u2019t want children from when we were young, Ella was an accidental pregnancy. \n\nThe other day, Ella was feeling sad because she\u2019s been fighting with her friends, and she called me to talk. She said that she\u2019d tried to talk to her mom but Anna told her that she was busy and didn\u2019t have time to listen to her whine. And Ella asked me why her mom didn\u2019t seem to want her. This caught me by surprise and I just answered without thinking, I said that Anna didn\u2019t actually want children. \n\nElla wasn\u2019t even surprised though. She just said \u201cokay\u201d, like I just confirmed what she thought all along. But then my sister called me and was really angry that I said that. She said I was trying to screw up her relationship with her daughter and that she was a good mom, so I didn\u2019t have a right to say such things. But it\u2019s true. Anyways, AITA? What I said probably hurt my niece, but she knows I didn\u2019t say it unkindly and that I was just telling the truth. The only person really upset with me is my sister. So am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: My niece has actually asked this before, and I gave an evasive answer that she saw through in a second. So I guess I felt like she deserved some honesty, because she\u2019s been beating herself up about not being good enough to be loved- and it\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s her mom\u2019s, so I said so. I think word for word I said something like \u201cyour mom never really wanted to have children when we were younger\u2026 so she does love you, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll ever be the best at the emotional support, and the things moms are supposed to do.\u201d", "created_utc": 1691595244, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mimz0/aita_for_telling_my_niece_that_her_mom_didnt_want/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

True or not.", "Massive YTA.", "NTA\n\nI'm sure it was difficult for Ella to hear. \n\nHere's the thing that many people are missing about why you did her a huge solid; Ella can stop blaming herself for her mother's inadequacies. Kids need to be told when shit their parents do or don't do isn't their fault. \n\nContinue being a loving support system for Ella. It's possible that when Ella is an adult, Anna will be able to relate to her better.

She's not meeting her emotional needs.", "YTA, regardless of how bad their relationship is and how much you thought you might be helping, it is NOT YOUR PLACE to share information like this.  What good do you think it will do?\n\nYou need to profusely apologize to both of them asap.", "Yta that\u2019s a terrible thing to tell a teenager.", "YTA. You don\u2019t tell children that their parents didn\u2019t want them. Maybe it makes you feel better because you think you are right, but it just makes you an asshole.", "YTA. What's the benefit of telling her? You think she'll feel better about her mother being standoffish and unemotional with the knowledge she didn't want children in the first place?\n\nThe answer is this: \"Your mom loves you. She's not great at showing it, and I know that hurts. It's not fair to you at all. But there's nothing about *you* that makes her that way, and *I* love you very much.", "NTA. My mom informed me she had never wanted kids, and only had me at the request of her dying mother, at the ripe old age of 5 years old. She would brag about this fact to me. Its better for your neice to know so she won't think there is something wrong with her. You gave her the tools she needed to make an informed decision on how to interact with her mother. She now knows her mother will not support her emotionally, and now she can seek that elsewhere (probably from you).", "Hurts a lot less than her realizing it herself one day, or worse, her mother eventually telling her.\n\nSauce; I was told by my mom that the only reason I exist is because my dad wanted kids, and how she's happy she has a way to hurt him by withholding contact. She was stone cold sober btw.", "YTA don't say this to a kid. Ugh. It should be \"talk to your mom about your feelings\". It may have been the truth as you see it, but it isn't your truth to tell. Maybe your sister did never want children, but she kept her daughter, meaning--regardless of what she told you, she wanted her daughter. Maybe your sister isn't able to express emotions in a typical way, it doesn't mean she doesn't want her kid. Yeesh. You've done some damage to people you love. I totally believe it was accidental but dang...you should apologize to your sister.", "YTA.\n\nSounds to me like you like being the cool aunt. Maybe instead of patting yourself on the back about how awesome you are, you can put some of that energy into supporting your nieces relationship with her mom.\n\nNo matter how good of an aunt you are, your niece is going to benefit the most from a strong relationship with her mother.\n\nSounds like you sister isn\u2019t the kind of mother that you think she should be, but not all mothers are the same.", "YTA. That\u2019s life-changing, trauma-inducing news right there. You\u2019re supposedly the adult here. You can\u2019t take back what you said, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can rationalize that she didn\u2019t seem surprised, so what you said had no effect.", "When I was about 15 or so, my aunt told me I wasn't wanted and my mom wanted to actually have an abortion but my grandma (dad's mom) convinced her not to go through with it. It explained a lot of things regarding my relationship with my mom but it also created a lot of my own issues and I have definitely developed a complex.", "Wtf man, you don't even know if Anna loves her. Some parents used to think they didn't want kids until they had a baby, and now Ella is gonna think she's unloved. YTA, and saying without thinking isn't an excuse.", "YTA. It's scary that you thought it was acceptable to say this to a teenager. You are going to cause actual psychological harm by saying shit like this. Also: if your sister truly 100% didn't want to become a mother, she could have had an abortion. She didn't. She chose to become a parent.\n\nYou're also full of shit. Originally you wrote that you said it without thinking, then edit to say she'd asked before and thought she deserved honesty. You did this purposefully, either because you actually didn't realize how awful this was to say out loud, or wanted to hurt your sister's relationship with her daughter even more.", "YTA. There are ZERO circumstances that would ever make telling your niece that your sister didn\u2019t want her appropriate. Zero. Automatically makes you a bad aunt. Your niece might not seem upset to you but she\u2019s most likely heartbroken permanently. Because of you. What a sad person you must be that you did that and still think you\u2019re in the right.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou acted without thinking - regardless if Ella had brought this up before, she's still only a child and you need to consider the ramifications of what you're telling her. It's great that you're there for your niece and filling in the emotional support her own mother can't handle but what you said isn't going to help. \n\nWhat upsets me the most though is Anna calling you, after she said she was too busy to listen to Ella's whining, to whine to you about this. Truthfully, if Anna was more present in her own daughter's life this entire situation wouldn't have happened. Anna needs to step up here and be a Mom, I cannot imagine what Ella must be feeling and thinking to even want to ask you this question in the first place. I'd be calling her back to tear her a new one.", "YTA, big time you crossed the line. Have no business to interfere with that relationship.  You have caused and created a big damage in several relationships.", "YTA. Just because you believe it to be the truth doesn't make it the truth. In reality, you have no idea how Anna really feels about Ella or being a mother. She might have said some unguarded things at some point, but you're wrong to use that as evidence of anything. What you did was really bad. Ella did not need to hear anything like that and you have no business interfering in the relationship between a parent and child based on what you reckon.\n\nYou're 28 years old. I'd expect more sensitivity and diplomacy from my eight year old.", "Just because it's true and you didn't say it in a mean tone doesn't mean it wasn't incredibly hurtful. You crushed any ounce of hope that child had that her mother loves and cares about her. \n\nYou need to think before you speak. \n\nYTA", "YTA I don't think you should have said that.  \n\nYou should have said something vague and turned the conversation back to listening to your niece.  \n\nShe needs someone to listen.  She does not need to hear that her mother didn't want her.", "You should have maybe ended it with something along the lines of \"I'll always be here for you or I got your back\" type of thing even though it would have made her mother look worse.  When you go this route and admit to something like this, you definitely need to reaffirm an unwavering support.", "NTA: I hope you said it in an incredibly kind way. At 14 she needed to know that it isn't her fault, but rather that your sister is the one at fault. I'll never understand why women have children that they can't love properly.", "NTA\u2026HOWEVER, you will need to help revisit this with your niece over time. I know you will get dinged by others here, but what is true is true. Better ways to tell it both in substance and timing? Sure. But your niece and sister are not strangers and sooner or later this will come out. The compensation, if there is any, is that now the three of you will have time to get this right. So, again NTA, but you have lots of work to do. I wish you well.", "NTA. Anna shouldn\u2019t have dismissed her child when she was going through something like that. We\u2019re all busy - I know. But seems like Ella\u2019s mother has done this enough to strain their relationship. Her response of \u201cokay\u201d shows she wasn\u2019t thinking anything differently anyhow. As a young adult now, would\u2019ve wanted to know something like that as a teen in order to have a better understanding of my relationship with her and take that information to make it grow. Otherwise, she\u2019d probably just keep questioning herself.", "YTA\n\nYou don't tell a kid that kind of info especially \"without thinking\". I will say that it looks like the mom should be more caring toward her daughter. However you are in no right to give that kind of info to your niece. You could've found a way to avoid the question. Your actions could have definitely affected their mother-daughter relationship", "YTA\n\nYou had other options. \n\n\n\nYou could have said you didn't know what was happening and you would have a conversation with your sister.  And then have an open conversation, tell your concerns for your nieces mental health, that she feels rejected, and so on. \n\nYou could have suggested therapy. Family therapy. Counseling for your niece. Whatever. You yourself could have talked to a professional  before putting such a burden on a teenager to carry the rest of her life. \n\nYou had no right to tell your niece this, because it wasn't your story to tell. It does not make anything better, it doesn't help, it only benefits yourself and I think you know that. You get to be the \"truthful, best friend aunt\" even though you just hurt her and your sister. \n\nIf you truly wanted to help, you would have given your sister the benefit of the doubt and help her see her mistakes, so that she could have a better relationship with her daughter.", "Probably YTA. No one needs to hear their moms didn\u2019t want them. I grew up knowing my mom never actually wanted kids (she told us- not in a mean way but in a matter of fact way) and she always used to follow it up with but my kids ended up being the joy of my life, I\u2019m happy I did, bla bla bla I mean. She looks back with rose tinted glasses. She didn\u2019t want kids. She was frustrated all the time, we were work for her. Was depressed and had to sleep most of the time. And now In our 30s we are all pretty well cut off from her and she resents us again. \n\nI don\u2019t want kids. But if I happened to have a kid and they asked I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say I had never wanted kids or I wasn\u2019t the type of have kids or that it had never been a calling. I think id choose to tell them I struggle with balancing all the pulls of life. Finding time for my own care, my career and how much time I want to give them. I\u2019d say in my perfect world I\u2019d give them every minute and be everything I possibly could and would be happy and we\u2019d have an easy life. And I\u2019d say it frustrates me too that it\u2019s never perfect. Id assure them that I love them. And that we can try to make a plan to have more one on one. What I\u2019m saying is \u2026.. if I had kids, I\u2019d be the mom who never wanted them. But over my dead body would I ever tell them that. I\u2019d want to shape it the best I could. And I\u2019d be beyond angry if someone else interfered with that narrative. \n\nYou\u2019re sister needs to do better.

The solution wasn\u2019t to tell her that she wasn\u2019t wanted and so her mum will probably never be that great at this, and just giving her something horrible to think about for the rest of her life.", "Yta,  not your place, and so many other options to handle it", "YTA. Your mouth caused more harm than good. You shouldn't have uttered the words into existence.  You should have talked to your sister privately about how Ella was feeling and encouraged her to talk to her daughter.", "YTA.  Your niece is at a delicate age and having that information is going to do her more harm than good.  You have probably confirmed her fear.  You also seem to realize it was a mistake because you claim it was a knee jerk reaction, not a well thought out decision to tell her, and that you evaded it previously likely because you knew it wasnt good for her to know.  At some point truth may be the best for her, but at 14 I would not agree.  Now try to seek some help for her (therapy or being there for her), because she is probably spiraling now that her fear was confirmed.", "Definitely work on that! How does one answer \u201cwithout thinking\u201d in this situation? Think a better excuse would be I wasn\u2019t listening or paying attention & honestly just didn\u2019t care....", "Agree. It's not black and white. The teen went to their aunt, who they have a close relationship to, for some emotional support because she isn't getting what she needs from the parent. The teen thinks it's her fault. It is not. I applaud the aunt for getting in front of it now, rather than when the teen becomes an adult and is more messed up from it, and it is more difficult to repair.\n\nYes, she is still young, but her needs are not getting fulfilled, and no one is going to be honest with her about the why? That is what is more damaging to a child. \n\nNTA.", "Agree. \nMy mum didn\u2019t want children. I was an accident baby. And tbh,   It actually was healing and allowed me to grow and adopt the love and support I needed.      But it also has a dark side.  We don\u2019t speak anymore because of it\u2026\n*edit correction* there\u2019s also a thousand other reasons. But all stems from the not wanting kids.", "I hope their SO says they were never wanted", "It's so true. People don't become ultimately capable of meeting all the needs of everyone once they become parents, but sometimes choosing to withhold that ability because they're terrible people who can't be bothered. Most parents are doing their best with the limited human capacity we all have.", "Who tells a child they aren\u2019t wanted or loved. And what kind of AH finds justification? Op purposely caused damage that was not necessary. Someone in her corner to support her?  She put a wedge between mother and daughter so she can slide in and be the aunt \u201cwho cares about her\u201d\u2014- if OP cared about her she would have protected her from the \u201ctruth\u201d. If it was true Op\u2019s sister didn\u2019t want her daughter then she wouldn\u2019t have gone through with the pregnancy.", ">You don\u2019t tell children that their parents didn\u2019t want them.\n\nYeah, you let the kid think it's her fault that mummy doesn't love her, that's what a good person would do.", "From someone raised by a cold, not maternal mother, I would say her niece has probably known or at least felt unwanted prior to it being confirmed by aunt. Should aunt have said it? No, but she's NTA. The shitty mom is.\n\nNiece is going to have some anger issues as an adult. I speak from experience.", "Completely disagree.\n\nConstantly being lied to your face that you are loved, only to be rejected over and over, and not understanding as to why it is that you are feeling the way you do, is a surefire way to raise an emotionally damaged child.\n\nThere is absolutely no value in lying to her.\n\nIf she knows the truth, she can stop thinking that something is wrong with her, which she most definitely was thinking.\n\nYou can't tell somebody that their mom loves them, if they really don't. It's not gonna fix anything, it's gonna make matters worse.", "I did. I say this to her almost every day. She is really struggling because being a teenager sucks, and it\u2019s even worse without a loving family. Other than her mom, my parents (her grandparents) and I are her only family\u2026 so I do my best.", "At no time in history has telling people they were simply unwanted ever solved a problem.", "nah, a 14 year old deserves to finally hear their suspicions are true - mom doesnt care because she never wanted kids, so it makes sense that mom would rather be deep in her work than be emotionally invested in their child. if that \u2018tough spot\u2019 in life is just this girls entire childhood, then fuck no OP shouldnt lie. mom shoudve been more present, yet this little girl nonchalantly accepted that her mother will just never be there for her. my own mother is like this. from personal experience and 28 years later, am i supposed to excuse everything my she-parent did (or rather DIDNT do) and just go \u2018oh, she is just in a tough spot\u2019? the damage of trying to continuously prove yourself to someone else who will never genuinely care about your well being nor accomplishments (who are supposed to) can never compare to the hurt of disconnecting from parents and simply proving you can do things for YOURSELF (proudly, at that).", "She didn't say her niece was unwanted or unloved. She said her sister never wanted kids in general and that her mom does love her but has a hard time being their for her emotionally. Which isn't wrong or cruel or trying to sabotage the relationship with her niece and sister.", "The person who actually cares does that.\n\nWhat's it gonna do if you keep telling the niece that her mom loves her, if her mom simply doesn't?\n\nIt's gonna give the niece a false interpretation of what love is, and so she will settle with some guy who mistreats her (similar to her mom), but won't be able to tell that it's not okay to be treated that way.\n\nIf she has no reference point to compare things to, then she won't know what actual love is, making her suspectible.", "So why do you care if what you said was right or wrong? If your niece is your only concern .... then you should be talking to her.", "You do well. You weren\u2019t wrong for wanting to be honest with Ella that it isn\u2019t her fault her mother treats her this way, but there are gentler ways to go about that discussion. It\u2019s better for kids to understand that their parents have faults so they don\u2019t have to internalize everything negative their parent does as something they the children are responsible for. But they words we use have a significant impact. I think this discussion was one that should have been done in person over a cup of tea, not over the phone in a few short words.", "And at no time has living in a broken relationship ever been the solution to anything. Learning how to tell the truth is important, true, but familial silence simply breeds abuse.", "I can see where you're coming from but can you rightly say that having this conversation with a potentially depressed and vulnerable young lady over a phone call is the right thing to do?  \nAnd is OP even the right person to be telling Ella this in the first place and I say this because, OP could hear the tone of voice but she couldn't see the body or facial language, I can agree that Ella is old enough to have worked the truth out for herself, she already knows the truth but you don't call someone and ask this question when you're in a good place emotionally, there are many reasons behind why Ella would have reached out in this manner and a great many of them would be better handled and gauged one on one.", "Semantics. That\u2019s exactly what it implies. \n\n\u201cSo I guess I felt like she deserved some honesty because she\u2019s been beating herself up about not being good enough to be loved\u2014 and it\u2019s not her fault, it\u2019s her mom\u2019s so I said so\u201d\n\nShe took that and ran with it.  She knew exactly what she was doing. She played on a child\u2019s emotions. That\u2019s not looking out for said child. In fact she even went as far as to say her mom won\u2019t be there for \u201cemotional support\u201d or the \u201cthings moms are supposed to do\u201d. Who TF does OP think she is? None of that is ok to do or say. How does she know? As I said if Mom didn\u2019t want her she would never have had her. People\u2019s opinions on wanting children do change. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s place to say such a thing. What once was does not always mean what is. \n\nIn fact that\u2019s emotional manipulation. Just because her mom was busy at the moment doesn\u2019t mean her mom wouldnt* be there for her later. OP is an AH and an opportunist.", "You can easily assign blame without blaming niece for being born.", "This isn\u2019t about blaming. Lots of parents have a child that they might not otherwise have had. There\u2019s no guilt or shame in that. Letting people know that, and then at some later date blowing up because it has become known is blameworthy.", "Telling anyone they were unwanted as a child is not okay. May not be planned but doesn\u2019t mean unwanted.\n\nAnna has \u201cnot been neglectful or abusive\u201d. People who are not warm & fuzzy \u201cchoose\u201d to have children. \n\n\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t my mother want me\u201d .... that\u2019s a real holy shit moment. One does not react to that \u201cwithout thinking\u201d. The only person that matters here is this kid. OP did not do anything to help her. What exactly should niece do with this information? \n\neta"]}
