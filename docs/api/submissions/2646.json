For 2 years now, we\u2019ve fostered children. Our families have been supportive. Last Christmas, we had a long term placement \u201cWhitney\u201d (they were with us 6 months at the time). My husband\u2019s family made sure to get her gifts if they were buying some for our bio children. Mine did the same, all except for my mother. She got my kids really nice gifts, but for Whitney she got nothing. Whitney was a toddler so she didn\u2019t notice, but it did rub me the wrong way. I talked with my mom and she said she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d matter as Whitney would be going home soon. I told her in the future, of course gifts for our own kids aren\u2019t expected, but if she buys for one, she has to buy for everyone.\n\nWhitney was reunited with her parents 2 months later. Shortly after we got our next placement \u201cSamantha\u201d. She\u2019s 8 years old.

She then said \u201cBut she\u2019s going home soon\u201d.

My mom kept arguing and finally I said I won\u2019t accept gifts for Danny and Clarissa. If she shows up with just gifts for them, then they\u2019ll be sent back.

And a book is a friend you can carry through life, even if you are separated from your first copy just pick up another and you're back with your friend again.\n\nA PSA for anyone who has children who you encounter in your life who are in the system: many are moved at short notice and with no proper luggage, often packing their belongings into plastic or even trash bags. Imagine how it feels to be moved around with no control and subconsciously feeling that you and your belongings have the same value as trash. A roomy backpack or holdall is a great gift.
