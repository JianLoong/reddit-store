For 2 years now, we\u2019ve fostered children. Our families have been supportive. Last Christmas, we had a long term placement \u201cWhitney\u201d (they were with us 6 months at the time). My husband\u2019s family made sure to get her gifts if they were buying some for our bio children. Mine did the same, all except for my mother. She got my kids really nice gifts, but for Whitney she got nothing. Whitney was a toddler so she didn\u2019t notice, but it did rub me the wrong way. I talked with my mom and she said she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d matter as Whitney would be going home soon. I told her in the future, of course gifts for our own kids aren\u2019t expected, but if she buys for one, she has to buy for everyone.\n\nWhitney was reunited with her parents 2 months later. Shortly after we got our next placement \u201cSamantha\u201d. She\u2019s 8 years old. We don\u2019t know how much longer she\u2019ll be with us but it does seem like reunification is on the horizon (exciting for Samantha!).\n\nMy mom recently called me asking what \u201cthe kids wanted for Christmas\u201d. She worded it just like that, not \u201cwhat do Danny and Clarissa\u201d, just \u201cthe kids\u201d. I mentioned an idea for each child, including Samantha. She then said \u201cBut she\u2019s going home soon\u201d. I replied yes but she will be with us through the holidays at minimum and she\u2019s old enough to understand that the other kids are receiving gifts and she\u2019s not. My mom kept arguing and finally I said I won\u2019t accept gifts for Danny and Clarissa. If she shows up with just gifts for them, then they\u2019ll be sent back. My mom told me I\u2019m being spiteful. I said I can\u2019t control her buying gifts for Samantha, but she won\u2019t exclude her.\n\nMy kids are not the type to expect gifts. They wouldn\u2019t notice if grandma didn\u2019t get them anything. Another relative who usually goes all out was having a hard time last year and didn\u2019t get them anything, they didn\u2019t say a word. So I know they won\u2019t even be fazed by this. This also isn\u2019t an issue of money on my mom\u2019s end. She admits she could afford to buy Samantha something. \n\nMy husband is backing me up but some of my relatives aren\u2019t.

That suggests to me that her connection with her own family is still strong. She not only doesn\u2019t need your parents to step into a familial role but also likely would be uncomfortable if they did so. This is currently viewed as temporary for everyone, including Samantha. Treating her the same way as if she\u2019s going to stay forever may not be what she wants.\n\nThat being said, they should buy her something if they are giving other gifts to children.

Especially if you consistently have one foster child in your care (which is sounds like) then the mom can learn to expect to get 3 childrens gift for your family each year or none at all. Good on you for sticking up for the foster children and raising your children to not expect gifts. \n\nIt\u2019s already alienating to be a foster child amongst \u201cbio\u201d family, and I imagine Christmas is very difficult, emotional, and overstimulating for them.
