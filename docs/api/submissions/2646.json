For 2 years now, we\u2019ve fostered children. Our families have been supportive. Last Christmas, we had a long term placement \u201cWhitney\u201d (they were with us 6 months at the time). My husband\u2019s family made sure to get her gifts if they were buying some for our bio children. Mine did the same, all except for my mother. She got my kids really nice gifts, but for Whitney she got nothing. Whitney was a toddler so she didn\u2019t notice, but it did rub me the wrong way. I talked with my mom and she said she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d matter as Whitney would be going home soon. I told her in the future, of course gifts for our own kids aren\u2019t expected, but if she buys for one, she has to buy for everyone.\n\nWhitney was reunited with her parents 2 months later. Shortly after we got our next placement \u201cSamantha\u201d. She\u2019s 8 years old.

She then said \u201cBut she\u2019s going home soon\u201d. I replied yes but she will be with us through the holidays at minimum and she\u2019s old enough to understand that the other kids are receiving gifts and she\u2019s not. My mom kept arguing and finally I said I won\u2019t accept gifts for Danny and Clarissa. If she shows up with just gifts for them, then they\u2019ll be sent back. My mom told me I\u2019m being spiteful. I said I can\u2019t control her buying gifts for Samantha, but she won\u2019t exclude her.\n\nMy kids are not the type to expect gifts.

She can then budget accordingly and buy all the kids something less expensive, or just not give gifts. \n\nAnd yes, no one should expect presents or demand that presents should be bought for them or their children. However, as adults we can also appreciate that kids have complicated feelings and need to be treated equally no matter their formal relationship. You are doing incredible work fostering kids, and you aren't asking your mother to spend more money, just to help make sure the foster kids feel included by buying for everyone OR not buying at all. It's really not that hard, and it also makes sense to anyone with even half a heart. The kids are you are fostering are going through what may be the toughest time of their life, and they need to feel valued and included.", "NTA. Thank you for fostering. I know it isn't easy. We work with foster children all the time. Please remind your mother that these children's lives are in chaos and providing a loving, caring, nurturing, and inclusive environment is exactly what they need.", "NTA\n\nYou are right, your mom and relatives are wrong.", "NTA. One of the best things about celebrating Christmas with kids is watching their reactions to gifts and the fun they have, whether they\u2019re related to you or not. Exclusion is not cool and is definitely not in the spirit of the holiday.", "NTA foster kids goes through enough hardships as it is, being left out on christmas hurts. You\u2019re a good person for doing what you do OP :-)", "Thank you for being a supportive foster parent.  We need more like you!", "NTA, foster care is hard enough for children without family members making it harder. Good on you for standing up for your foster kids!", "NTA\n\nPrepare a present that your mom can give Samantha. She doesn't have to buy anything, and you make sure Samantha feels welcome.", "NTA - kids in foster care are already having a hard enough time without someone refusing to buy them gifts for the holidays because it's not their \"real\" home. Thank you for being so protective of the kids you care for, you sound like a genuinely kind and thoughtful person.", "NTA, how hard is it to buy a Barbie or stuffed animal? They aren\u2019t expensive", "NTA.  Foster parent here.  What the hell is your mom thinking?  These poor kids are already so vulnerable, traumatized, and a lot of times victimized.  It is our charge to make sure these kids feel like they are as much a part of the family as everyone else.", "Nope NTA. So what if she is going home soon? Right now she is HERE and is a child. Give her something she can take home with her. Why would that be a bad thing? She's being stubborn and petty", "Wow that is cold blooded. NTA but your mom is a huge one.", "NTA. And as a former foster child I appreciate how much you care about Samantha and her feelings! Even more so how excited you are for her to be reunited with her family! She has a great foster family with you and your husband! Thank you for fostering!", "NTA\n\nGood for you standing up for your foster daughter.  Too often, foster children are seen and treated as \"less than\" by families.  I could not imagine anyone being so obvious as they hurt a child, but apparently your mother thinks nothing of how that child will feel seeing the obvious exclusion.\n\nBeing a foster parent is a difficult role to navigate.  By being so supportive and ensuring the children in your care are feeling safe, included and fully supporting their reunification process, you are doing an incredible service to them.  Thank you.", "NTA and I commend you for your thoughtfulness. You are a hero for fostering children.", "NTA. You may not be able to just get Samantha another gift and give it to her separately, but could you maybe buy it and give it to your mother to give to her or us she too stubborn even for that??", "NTA.  You have a simple ask, she can comply or deal with it.  So what if they're going home soon?  They're here NOW.  And those memories.... will go with them.  Why would she want to give a child bad memories of Christmas?", "NTA. The world needs more foster parents like you. Thank you for standing up to your mom snd standing your ground on this. Seriously, these kids have already been through so much. Your mom is being a total Scrooge if she can't see that.", "NTA\n\nWhen I was a kid my cousin, who was in and out of foster care and passed through family members (unfortunate complicated situation) was plopped on our doorstep Christmas Eve with no warning. My mom sat me and my brother down, explained the situation, and we proceeded to divvy up some presents. Sure, I was bummed my Pikachu stuffy was given to my cousin but I also knew I wouldn\u2019t want to be the only kid in the house who didn\u2019t get to open presents on Christmas morning, so why would we do that to her?\n\nYour bio kids are gonna notice and honestly, if they are as generous as you, getting a gift while their foster sibling doesn\u2019t is just going to ruin the excitement of a gift anyway. It\u2019s an incredibly unkind hill for your mother to die on.", "NTA at all. If I was your mother, I would assume I would most likely be buying a gift for a third child at every holiday, and if that child had a birthday while under your care, they would get a gift then as well. I can imagine putting up some boundaries so I did not get too attached, but her view on this is just wrong. It should be her pleasure to provide a gift she can afford for children who have endured hardship in one form or another.", "NTA and it is so heart warming to hear how you are supporting, advocating for and protecting these kids. Frankly, I cannot understand how your mother can justify not giving a child a gift. \nA. Child. \nI\u2019d encourage you to take it one step further and inform her that there really isn\u2019t any place in your holiday celebrations for her insensitivity \u2013 and if you have the gumption to say this, cold hearted behavior. Tell her that if she isn\u2019t holding three gifts with three different names on the cards, she won\u2019t be let in the house.", "Just tell your mother she is not welcome on Christmas this year\n\nproblem solved\n\nNTA", "NTA and thank you for what you are doing", "NTA. You always buy for ALL the kids or none of them.", "When I was growing up my mom had a friend who was a really shitty foster parent. She broke up families on purpose, and she would apply to have her foster kids go stay elsewhere over the holidays so she wouldn't have to buy them gifts and would just spend time with her own kids. She was selfish and never had their best interest at heart. \n\nThank you for not being like that, I admire people who foster so so much. Stick to your guns. You are so NTA.", "Where is your mom's charitable spirit for these kids? Especially at the holidays? Who cares if they leave soon. What's that got to do with anything? Is 20 bucks spent on a gift going to break the bank? NTA", "NTA\n\nThank-you for what you are doing, and for trying to give those kids a great experience.\n\nI, myself, spent time in the foster system.  Mind you, birth to 6 months, so I remember nothing of the foster family.  But I know they took care of me well, and I'm glad to see you doing the same for your kids.", "NTA Thank you for showing basic human decency. Your mother is deeply in the wrong. Somehow she raised you to be a better person than she is, I guess.", "NTA", "FFS She's 8. They should just buy her a damn present.", "Seriously, what a hag. You can't be bothered to make a child you don't know feel special at Christmas? Particularly one that's likely working through grief and/or trauma? Yuck.", "THIS.  If you can't teat foster children the same as your own when it comes to holiday gifts, then I agree with OP, no gifts at all. These kids have been traumatized enough and don't need to feel more exclusion in their lives.  NTA", "NTA, can hear the sound of singeing from here\u2026", "100% agreed.  People who don't think this way probably shouldn't be fostering kids. OP is 100% NTA.", "Exactly, not to mention OPs mom is missing the meaning of Christmas. It's about family, love and support. Mom isn't being loving, supportive or acting like family at all. She is being cruel to children. What a monster. \n\nNTA OP, great job making sure all of your kids feel loved.", "I'd also add,\n\n\"Mom, no one is asking you to say that Samantha is your grandchild. But she is a child in need, that has been through too much at her age. Why are you being stubborn, and cruel, to a child that needs to be shown a kindness? Frankly, even more than the other kids?\"", "The lack of humanity is stunning.", "She's even admitted that she can afford it!!!! She just...prefers to discriminate against an eight year old for the crime of not being blood related?!?! And in a way that rubs it in the child's face!!!!\n\n\nFoster and adopted family is big in my family. We have a lot of \"non blood relations,\" and we are all treated SO equally, that my entire generation was completely unaware that we weren't all blood related until our *twenties!* And when my one cousin called me to tell me, I accused her of lying for attention!!! Which was something she did often do, to be fair, lol!\n\n\nI'd be telling dear ol' ma that she can spend Christmas alone to think about what's really important to her!!!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She likes the stability and has said often she does feel like our family.\n\nMy mom doesn\u2019t have to view her as such, but I\u2019m not going to stop how I treat my foster kids, who want to feel included. Please do some research on trauma based care.", "Such an awful way to think. Per OP the 8 year old WILL be there through the holidays. What a horrible way to make a kid feel. My gosh", "Hey - all the kids are of equal value. Idk what point you\u2019re trying to make here except that one is somehow less than the others? Pretty gross to be on the \u201cfuck that kid - Christmas is for our special bloodline only\u201d train.\n\nLol.", "My children will survive one Christmas without presents from one relative. It won\u2019t traumatize them. It\u2019d be one thing if I denied any presents, ever, from anyone.\n\nThis \u201crandom foster kid\u201d who has experienced neglect, rejection and a lot of other problems won\u2019t be traumatized by the lack of gift, but the message it sends. She is not worthy enough. It may seem silly over a gift, but holidays are already stressful and traumatic for kids in care. When you have been through trauma, even small things can act as a trigger. \n\nYes, she\u2019ll go home. But I rather she goes home with good memories of her time here.", "Yeah you sound about as much of an AH as OPs mom.  My Mom goes out and buys small presents for my cousin\u2019s children as well as her own grandkids.  They usually don\u2019t cost much but it\u2019s a small thing.  My oldest cousin was married for a time to a man who had a child and my Mom bought her a gift as well. She hadn\u2019t even met the kid but she still got her something so she wouldn\u2019t feel excluded.", "100% I just can't even think why someone would think it's ok to do this to  an already horribly disadvantaged child potentially making them feel more alone or excluded.

It\u2019s a hard life, and the world needs more foster parents like you.", "That sounds more than fair.", "To add to my previous comment: If she's not willing to even hand her one that you bought and pretend, then maybe she can't participate and you should stress that to your mom. Is this really THE HILL she feels is worth dying on for the holidays? In your own house? \nAgain, you're NTA, but I'd put have to put my foot down on this one because no way would I allow anyone to hurt my kids in my house. You're a much better Mom than your Mom is. \nShe is TA. Go Mama Bear!", "OP, you are a saint. Protect those kids.", "I agree. And seriously, how hard is it to buy a small gift for a child? It\u2019s not like your mom is paying for college or buying cars. It doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. Just something so the child doesn\u2019t feel left out. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine how hard it is for those kids to be shuffled around, especially if they\u2019re old enough to care about the holidays. I\u2019m with OP. Get a small, inexpensive gift so the child doesn\u2019t feel even more abandoned on Christmas, or don\u2019t get anyone gifts.", "And what **might** happen down the road shouldn't even be a consideration for something like this. It's a gift being given to a child.\n\nIf anything, that they might go home soon just means they'll be able to go home with more positive memories and some tangible signs that they were loved and well cared for.

Your mom is terrible.", "Tell your mother that you will pay for the gift. If she still refuses you know how she really feels.", "Maybe encourage your bio kids to ask salient questions? Your oldest is old enough to understand how being excluded hurts. \"Hey grandma, where's Samantha's gift?\" hits differently from the mouth of a child.", "The vibe I get is that it's not about the money or the trouble for Grandma.  She WANTS to show preference for her grandkids over this \"temporary occupant.\"", "Right, but I think OP is right to say all or none. She\u2019s taking in vulnerable children to try to give them a little love and attention, at least temporarily. Allowing her mother to make them feel \u201cless than\u201d during Christmas is the opposite of what she\u2019s trying to accomplish."]}
