For 2 years now, we\u2019ve fostered children. Our families have been supportive. Last Christmas, we had a long term placement \u201cWhitney\u201d (they were with us 6 months at the time). My husband\u2019s family made sure to get her gifts if they were buying some for our bio children. Mine did the same, all except for my mother. She got my kids really nice gifts, but for Whitney she got nothing. Whitney was a toddler so she didn\u2019t notice, but it did rub me the wrong way. I talked with my mom and she said she didn\u2019t think it\u2019d matter as Whitney would be going home soon. I told her in the future, of course gifts for our own kids aren\u2019t expected, but if she buys for one, she has to buy for everyone.\n\nWhitney was reunited with her parents 2 months later. Shortly after we got our next placement \u201cSamantha\u201d. She\u2019s 8 years old.

She then said \u201cBut she\u2019s going home soon\u201d. I replied yes but she will be with us through the holidays at minimum and she\u2019s old enough to understand that the other kids are receiving gifts and she\u2019s not. My mom kept arguing and finally I said I won\u2019t accept gifts for Danny and Clarissa. If she shows up with just gifts for them, then they\u2019ll be sent back. My mom told me I\u2019m being spiteful. I said I can\u2019t control her buying gifts for Samantha, but she won\u2019t exclude her.\n\nMy kids are not the type to expect gifts.

She didn't choose to foster her daughter dud. Yeah it'd be great if she would, but she shouldn't be made to. It's not her decision that her daughter chose to have these children their lives.", "Exactly, I would understand if it was about whether she could afford it ... but OP has said her kids have been understanding in the past of getting fewer gifts or less expensive gifts (so grandma could redistribute the funds and instead of $30 gifts for 2 kids she could get $20 gifts for 3). This is an issue of not wanting to put the effort in, which is terrible.", "It's punishing her kids, for a situation they didn't sign up for.  It goes beyond a boundary, at that point, and just becomes petty.  Especially, when there are other options, that don't negatively affect the kids.", "You... didn't read what I said, did you?", "Would your mom accept a compromise of you giving her the gift to hand over to your foster child? So she doesn't have to buy anything but the atmosphere of everyone being included is maintained? \n\nIf she won't even accept that compromise then she is very toxic. \n\n(I threw a joint birthday party of sorts for my sons 1st birthday and a friend's older kid while they stayed with me during a tough time. And I set aside a bunch of cards and small gifts since everyone coming was coming for my 1 yo. So they could pick something and hand it over to the older kid too so he wouldn't feel left out since their birthdays were a day apart but no one was obligated to buy an extra gift for a child they didnt have any connection to)", "Can you give her money to pick up something in case it\u2019s a budget thing and she\u2019s too embarrassed to say so or if you\u2019re near her, buy a gift and drop it off for her to bring with your kids gifts?", "Do you think it's because it's a temporary placement? I suspect she may not want to get attached to a child who will be reunited (hopefully) with her family & won't see your mom again. Not everyone is cut out for fostering children.", " You foster regularly. You can\u2019t just keep refusing things for them because there isn\u2019t something for the foster children. Just fill the gap yourself.", "Exactly. What kind of black heart can see a child in these circumstances and purposefully choose to hurt that child further? It\u2019s sickening.", "OP\u2019s mom also didn\u2019t choose to have grandkids, yet she buys presents for them. \n\nIf OP would have an adopted child and a bio child, would the adopted child be excluded too! Would you defend that as well?", "Thats true. But her daughter is the mom of those kids. And she has a right to accept or decline gifts for all of them especially if she would think one of her kids would be hurt.", "Listen, I get what you\u2019re saying, but this is about good manners. Not getting the foster children gifts, and giving your grandchildren gifts in front of them is rude af.\n\nAnd let me say, I have two daughters, 18 and 22. I\u2019ve told them they don\u2019t need to have kids on my account\u2014I\u2019m not dying to be a grandmother at all. I\u2019ve been a single mom for several years (and frankly while I was married to their father, too, as he did so little) and I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m ready to be empty nest and enjoying myself. Even if they have kids, they know I won\u2019t be much of a \u201ctraditional\u201d grandmother, even though I\u2019ll love the kids to death. But there\u2019s kind of an unspoken law, in my opinion, that if you are a \u201cgrandma\u201d you grandma the heck out of any kids your children bring into your circle. Foster, adopted, friend-of-a-friend, pets\u2014whatever. ESPECIALLY for the holidays. Barring any bizarre situation or circumstances, it\u2019s your JOB.", "This has nothing to do with the fostering and everything to do with basic human decency. No one who has 1/2 a brain and 1/8 of a heart would show up for gifts for all the kids but one. That is some deliberate, nasty shit. Especially for a child who likely already feels tossed away and 'less than'. \n\nIf you really think Grandma is justified in leaving the foster kid out, you have a very serious character defect.", "It also wasn't her decision for her daughter to have biological children.", "Yep I've been trying to articulate this, Op made the choice not grandma, so it's hard to call her an ah even though she sounds horrible, but at the same time, Op is a Saint to foster and being fair seems the appropriate way to handle this.  Maybe they should go to the husband's family for Xmas where all children get gifts and be unavailable for the awkward drop-off.", "I was only in the system for about 5ish months when I was a teenager, and I'm almost three times the age now, I still have exacting memories of my time. I remember names, how I was treated, how my bedroom was set up compared to others.", "How is it petty to keep things fair?", "Why don't you stop with the what ifs? Those things aren't at all relevant so there's no need to speculate.", "So you're punishing children for your own selfish interests? Ok got it. When you have to tell your bio kids why grandma doesn't get them presents or sees them anymore that's not going to foster any kind of resentment at all. OP is very entitled, in my opinion, to her mother's money. I feel for the foster kids, I really do, it's terrible what they're going through and OP is great for doing what she's doing not everyone can buy punishing your kids for your choices isn't helping anything. No one is entitled to presents and I'm sure the foster kids are still getting some, but grandma has chosen to buy just for her bio kids and that should be respected.", "So you're forcing your beliefs onto others. You think that your view of the world is correct and no other way can be right? Sounds very judgemental to me. Kinda like how religious people push their view onto others and no other way is ok. Very telling.", "And you're an entitled ass if you think you should get to dictate how someone else spends their money.", "And she choose to honor that. Choose. Her choice. Her money. Her time. Stop trying to spend things that aren't yours to spend.", "This may be the reason your foster child will notice. It\u2019s also likely the reason Danny and Clarissa will notice there are no gifts from grandma.", "Could you buy it, wrap it, take it to her house and ask her to bring it with her and hand it out along with her own gifts? Surely, anyone with a heart and a brain would agree to that.", "Not receiving a gift is hardly a punishment. I mean, you didn\u2019t get me a Christmas gift, are you punishing me? \n\nThe kids won\u2019t even know they were going to get gifts. OP already said that.", "I\u2019m not going to let it get that far. It\u2019ll only further humiliate and traumatize Samantha. My mom getting her just desserts is not worth hurting a child. Besides, my children are not pawns.", "I think we\u2019ve established grandma has no heart", "Not realize they're not getting gifts, at Christmas, from grandma? Are you fucking kidding me? That's the stupidest thing I've ever read on this sub. You all seem so eager to spend someone else's money here, very entitled. OP has a chosen family, and that's very noble, her mom does not. Yet it's ok to force that family onto her. Ridiculous.", "You sound very Mama Bear; I like you!", "Serious question, what the actual fuck is wrong with you?? You do realize **no one** sees this the way you do because deliberately leaving one child out is cruel as fuck. And a disadvantaged kid at that.  You are truly awful to be championing someone for doing that.", "Yeah I don't believe that for a second. And even if it were true, so what? The toddler didn't expect gifts and OP was still upset on her behalf. Why is it okay to use her own kids as leverage to influence her mother?", "But how hard is it to buy a pretty $10 dress and maybe a craft kit for another $5 for an 8 year old child\u2026 OP isn\u2019t asking for exxy gifts, just for her mother to be more thoughtful", "[removed]", "It doesn't surprise me that someone would get on here saying something similar to this, I'm just surprised how cruel they are being to the other commenters.", "**ITS NOT HER FUCKING CHILD. ITS NOT HER RESPONSIBILITY. ALL OF YOU ARE VERY ENTITLED WITH OTHER PEOPLES MONEY. OP CHOSE THIS FOSTER CHILD NOT HER MOTHER. IF SHE WERE TO GET HER A PRESENT, THATS GREAT, IF NOT THAT SHOULD BE HER CHOICE. YOU ALL SEEM TO WANT TO SPEND MONEY AND TIME AND EFFORT THATS NOT YOURS TO SPEND. EVERYONE THAT SAID GRANDMA IS THE AH SHOULD SEND ALL THREE PRESENTS SO ITS FAIR. GO AHEAD IM WAITING FOR YOU ALL TO STEP UP WITH YOUR MONEY.** \n\nJFC the entitlement to someone else's money is flabbergasting. You all are AH to want to foist responsibility on OPs poor mom it's so frustrating.", "How hard is it to respect your mom? Obviously pretty hard. \n\nLet me say this, I wish OP's mom would buy the gift, I think it is the right thing to do given the situation. The issue I have is with OP punishing her children for not doing it. It's her choice to buy or not and saying no gifts for your grandkids is beyond ludicrous. There are other solutions besides doing that.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
