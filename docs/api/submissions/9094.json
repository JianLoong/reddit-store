From one 40-something lesbian to another: you screwed up.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to gatekeep what being gay means. You don\u2019t get to define your daughter\u2019s sexuality for her.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how open you are at home, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are right. It doesn\u2019t matter if your parents were homophobic assholes who threw you out and you made sure this kid could feel love and accepted every day. It doesn\u2019t matter if she is experimenting. **It is HER journey.**\n\nImagine if you were experimenting and claiming a label that felt safe- and your mom said to you: but you aren\u2019t really straight!\n\nAlso: she may in fact be gay. She may not. She\u2019s 18- she may just be starting to sort out romantic and sexual attraction. \n\nAnd while we are at it- Justin Bieber looks like half the lesbians I banged in college- so- his picture in her locker is proof of nothing.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, it is entirely possible for LGBT people to be homophobic (and as the B in LGBT, let me tell you now that 95% of the shit I have recevied from fellow LGBT people is from the \"L\" section, so there are plenty of lesbian bigots out there).\n\nThat aside, what you are being here is a massive asshole. She might be a lesbian, or she might not. She might be bi, questioning, anything. None of that matters. If you have a problem with someone giving her what you percieve to be bad advice about her college choices, that's what you should talk about. The \"stop saying that you're not even gay\" comment was totally uncalled for and incredibly rude. Also, looking Nala up on facebook and texting her is waaaaay out of line. I'm not surprised she's not talking to you.\n\nI understand why you'd be worried about her dropping soccer if that's where her scholarship comes from. As her Mum, it's also totally fair to worry about your kid getting too serious too fast in your opinion. But you've really handled this all very poorly and now you're just digging the hole deeper. Where is your wife in this?", "I'm sorry, but WHAT!?!?! Massively, YTA. Your daughter could be Bi or Demi. So what!? The issue wasn't even about her choice of partner, it was about you invalidating her mental health. YOU made it about her sexual orientation.", ">\u201cstop saying that your not even gay!\u201d   \n   \n>  \n>she can love who she wants to love, I want her happy\n\n  \nThe cognitive dissonance here is staggering.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your daughter could be bi or pan. Or asexual but not aromantic. Or lesbian and not like kissing. Or, sure, potentially straight but exploring her sexuality and relationships as a young adult which is absolutely her right to do.\n\nYou have seem to have some weird resentment about this or some calcified idea of what being gay is that Bree's actions clash with. You had a disagreement/argument with your daughter about college and it turned into an accusation against her sexuality that, whether permanent or transient, was not the issue.\n\nYou say you \"never meant to put your input in\" but this is certainly something you've been mulling over for some time and when you thought you had an opportunity to play that card in an unrelated argument you couldn't wait to slap it down on the table.\n\nFigure out your thoughts and feelings on this out because running back to her with \"I'm sorry I didn't mean it\" when you **did** mean it is only going to lead to this happening again the next time you feel resentful.", "It sounds like you handled a conflict (how to handle the sports-academics tradeoff) by escalating to something irrelevant. Bree\u2019s sexuality is irrelevant to the validity of Nala\u2019s plan. By dismissing it as \u201cthe plan of someone you\u2019re not sexually attracted to\u201d, you resorted to poor reasoning and weird name-calling. That tells me that you were unwilling or unable to discuss the plans on their merits, which is concerning, and makes you an AH here. Reaching out to Nala is also a strange move. What would you say to your mom if she had tried to call your girlfriend after telling you you\u2019re not gay?  \n\nYour homosexuality is irrelevant here. Your policing your daughter\u2019s sexuality, or claiming to know it better than her, is. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \"I was losing an argument so I dredged up something unrelated and hurtful to my own child, AITA?!\" \n\nYou don't get to tell anyone what their preferences are. \n\nWhat did you expect to happen? It'll probably be a long while before she cools off enough to contact you. Don't bother her in the meantime. \n\nAlso, her mental health comment makes me feel like soccer is just not what she wants anymore. It may be where her scholarship is coming from, but do you really want her miserable?", "My daughter is gay. I didn\u2019t have a flipping clue. She liked boys too. But when she came out as a high school sophomore, I believed her. It was never an issue with my husband or me. I can\u2019t believe I have to advise a gay a parent to  except their daughters choices. YTA.", "YTA- whether she is gay or not, only SHE knows. One lesbian isn't an expert on ALL lesbians Right or wrong on your assumptions, you've just completely disregarded and invalidated your daughters feelings instead of being the soft place to fall if this relationship goes south, which lets face it, at 18 years old is very possible. Don't be surprised if she shuts you out and doesn't come to you if her feelings change for fear of \"I told you so\". You also run the risk of her staying in an unhealthy relationship because she doesn't want you to be right.", "Wow. Yeah. YTA. A gay parent should know better. There's literally no excuse for this, and from your own words it sounds like your daughter is right and you don't care about her mental health. What kind of backward internalized homophobia led you to this?\n\nPlenty of women don't figure out they are lesbians until middle age or later. The fact that she behaved as most of her peer group expected while still literally a child doesn't invalidate her now.\n\nOh, and I'm seconding what the other woman said about Bieber.", "YTA. How is this seriously a question. Whether she's still a lesbian 20 years from now, or whether she's realized she's bisexual or straight or asexual, it is HER identity. You don't get to dictate it to her. You don't get to tell her she can't feel how she feels, explore, figure things out. No parent should ever do that do to their child, and it's so much worse considering you're also queer.\n\nYou really want to shut your daughter down from exploring her feelings and figuring out her identity? You really want to make her uncomfortable, both with her own feelings and with EVER discussing them with you again!?\n\nAnd what is up with your weird stereotypes. \"Lesbians don't like boy bands!!\" LMAO you couldn't even begin to guess how many lesbians I know that are obsessed with kpop boy bands. Contrary to the ugly stereotype, lesbians don't actually typically hate all men. Weird that you don't know that.", "YTA, you don\u2019t get to tell people what their sexualities are, it\u2019s not your place. That is for her and her only to sort out. YTA also for messaging Nala for basically a favor when it sounds like you were aggressive to her too.", "YTA . Ever heard of bisexuality or compulsory heterosexuality ?? Seriously , you should know better . You can be homophobic and gay , trust me . I see it happening alllll the time and you're a prime example !", "YTA. This is not your business, and was certainly not your business to comment on. Let your daughter figure things out for herself.", "Woah. The internet sees a new form of bigotry every day.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to have to explain why, but I will briefly spell it out for you:\n\n- you\u2019re LGBTQ+ yourself\n\n- your daughter, AT THE VERY LEAST as part of growing up, is experimenting with her own sexual identity and coming to terms with it as a newly minted adult. Wherever she may end up, she deserves your full support. (And I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s not gay at all. But you should have been there for supportive, open, and honest communication while she works to explore her own sexual identity as a teen and young adult.)\n\n- you still say she\u2019s not gay!\n\nYTA, you of all people should have been in her corner actively supporting her through what I thought you would have known is a difficult time for your own daughter, as I\u2019m sure you yourself remember the fear of people not understanding/not being accepted for who YOU really are.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m not sure if you can fix your relationship with your daughter at this point. You drove it 6 feet under, and fast.\n\nEdit: minor clarity.", "Yah YTA. Everyone\u2019s journey is different. And a lot of people are born with a not so clear cut \u201csingle sexual interest \u201c meaning: we don\u2019t all ALWAYS know. Exploring is key. \n\nAlso sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to play soccer anymore. Let her figure out her own consequences. You\u2019ve said the important reminder but now it\u2019s time to leave it alone", "YTA\n\nGay people can be homophobic the same way women can be misogynists.\n\nMainly by gatekeeping and saying there is a \"right way to be gay\" which is exactly what you did. So yes, your daughter's comment about you being homophobic could well be true.\n\nMaybe she's bisexual.\n\nMaybe she, like many other baby lesbians, fixated on non threatening, cute, soft male celebrities before realising their orientation. Pretty common so I hear.\n\nEither way you owe her a huge apology and good luck getting her to listen to you about her scholarship now after that level of damage.", "My sister is very gay and when she was a kid her walls were covered in boy band posters, she obsessed over them. You'd swear she was the most straight.", "YTA. It doesn't matter whether she's gay or not, it's not something you had a right to say. If she feels like she is gay right now, that is her reality and you have no say in it. She may also be demi- or asexual which does not take away from her being in a relationship with this girl.\n\nYou are denying her her own reality.

My wife and I both agreed that this was just college experimenting. I know this is a new world, but I also know my daughter.\n\nYou can't based that on her sexuality from the past. She's finding who she is. \n\n>I know this is a new world, but I also know my daughter.\n\nNo, you don't. Because if you do, you let her identify herself.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nAlso, bi-erasure. Her having crushes on boy bands does not exclude the possibility of her being attracted to women. And as a bi woman, it took a while for me to get comfortable being physically intimate with women, not because I wasn\u2019t attracted to them but just because it was different. So I don\u2019t find her comments to her brother all that damning either. She\u2019s exploring her sexuality and it\u2019s really not your place to tell her what she is and isn\u2019t, you should know that. \n\nGay people can have internalized homophobia and there is a MASSIVE problem in the community with biphobia and bi-erasure. So.", "Lol yeah, YTA. \n\nI came out as gay when I was 14. Within 6 months my mum was introducing us to her new partner, who was a woman. I was a bit put out because being gay was *my* thing, how dare my mum steal it from me? However I quickly realised how silly that was, and I never voiced it to anyone at the time, let alone my mum.\n\nYou sound like 14 year old me, trying to gatekeep who is \"allowed\" to identify as what. You're an adult, be better.", "Yta \n\n\n>Her whole childhood was her obsessing over Justin Bieber or One direction, her whole room was filled with posters of them.\n\nAs a 22 year old lesbian, my childhood was also being obsessed with one direction and my whole room was filled with posters of them\n\nYou don't get to decide if she's gay or not\n\n>She got upset and called me a \u201cmega AH\u201d and accused me of being \u201chomophobic\u201d (even tho I\u2019m gay)\n\nYou can be gay and homophobic. My best friends aunt is a lesbian, who thinks it's wrong for gay people to get married, and thinks other gay people are disgusting", "It sounds like you\u2019re gatekeeping being gay (I wrote this before reading other comments and seems I\u2019ve hit the nail on the head here) which is a bit weird. She\u2019s experimenting which isn\u2019t unusual, and you should be careful because the next accusation will be \u201cI\u2019m confused as I was brought up by lesbians, and you\u2019ve impacted on my sexual development\u201d as you\u2019ve involved yourself in her sexuality she\u2019d have a point, as you are gatekeeping what it means to be gay, and she\u2019s been exposed to homosexuality all her life, she could argue either point fairly and YOU opened the door to that. Be concerned about her education choices, fine, but her sexuality, and how she works through it is none of your business.", "Even growing up with two queer parents, heteronormativity is a thing and while I\u2019m very out, it still feels weird or like I\u2019m doing something wrong by kissing a girl. YTA. \n\nOh, and I was obsessed with a male celeb in high school. I also no longer date men. \n\nMaybe also look into dealing with your internalized homophobia? Kinda seems like you have some if your daughter is calling you homophobic", "YTA - stop gatekeeping your kid. Also don't message her girlfriend. It's fucking weird.", "I\u2019m a very straight woman in my late 40s, and sometimes I find kissing my (lovely, gorgeous, male) partner \u201cweird\u201d. (Most of the time it\u2019s lovely - when I don\u2019t over-think it.)\n\nIt\u2019s an odd thing to do - mash mouths together & wiggle tongues around. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s my adhd brain hyperfocusing on the wrong thing in the moment?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s the adhd sensory issues making it more weird than non-adhd people find it. \n\nBut if you think about it too much (probably best if you don\u2019t!) it is a very, very strange thing to do. If I was 18 I\u2019d probably be talking about how weird I find it.", "YTA. You messaged her partner?? What? I get you were concerned but congratulations you have really damaged the relationship. \n\nShe called you for support and instead of talking through her labs for soccer - it sounds like you got jealous of the her partner has on her and went off. Are you struggling with letting go? ( I get it as a mother I really do). Or are you so so angry over the \u201cfake\u201d lesbianism? It was not a good response", "YTA. \n\nI get that you\u2018re worried about your daughters scholarship. But nothing in this conversation was about her being gay or not. You say she can love whoever she wants to so let her find out what she wants. You could\u2019ve told her you\u2018re worried about her wanting to quit soccer, or that you\u2019re worried about Nala might having a bad influence on her. I have no idea why you thought bringing up the fact that she might not be gay might make her think twice.", "**YTA.** Have you thought about the possibility of her liking woman but being asexual, for example? I am more than sure that I only like woman but I am also sure that I wouldn't feel that comfortable with sleeping with anyone. That doesn't make me less of a lesbian.", "YTA. damn old people are such a nuisance", "You know YTA for the not even gay comment. \n\nI will address the other thing.  Athletic  scholarships  do fund college  and are awesome.  \n\nThat said, as a former  college athlete  in a non money making sport, you get all the burden of travel, practice, etc. (At least in season) and not the same level of academic support as football or men's basketball...so for a challenging  major (like physics or engineering) maintaining grades as well can be VERY difficult and stressful. \n\nBalancing scholarship money and performance/major is a big and important  discussion.   \n\nLetting it devolve like you did....I  think you need to try to apologize and reopen the dialog.  Try to get her to talk to an academic advisor in the school.", "YTA\n\nMaybe she is gay, maybe she isnt, maybe she is bi - who cares! She needs to be allowed to figure out who she is. \n\nThe discussion over the scholarship for uni is a complicated thing if it's harming her mental health then maybe she needs to look in to alternatives for funding her course.", "YTA\n\nHave you forgotten that bisexuality is a thing?", "YTA, you can\u2019t just say she is not gay and at the same time say you just want her happy. Also, bisexual people exist yk. People also sometimes discover their sexuality later in life.", "Wow.", "Lol YTA.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "YTA. Also homosexual people can still be homophobic, much like women can still be misogynists, black people can still be racist to black people etc.", "What in the bi erasure is this? Bree never said she was gay. YTA", "YTA. Maybe she\u2019s gay but doesn\u2019t like kissing. Maybe she loves Nala but isn\u2019t interested in physical intimacy. You can\u2019t determine what her sexuality is for her just because you\u2019re part of the LGBTQ+ community.", "I have the fattest crush on Norman Reedus (Daryl from TWD) but I am a BIG FAT LESBIAN. It really is her journey to go through and sometimes you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re gay until way way way later in life, and SOMETIMES it really is just one person of the same sex you\u2019re attracted too; and not others. Sexuality can be very fluid and it was wrong of you to essentially dismiss her journey and tell her what she is and what she isn\u2019t. Imagine someone doing that to you if they haven\u2019t already, and if they have, you can only imagine how she feels. YTA my guy, sorry.", "YTA. Apart from the obvious gatekeeping of her possible queerness, it sounds like you need to talk to her about how things are going at school.  Sounds like maybe she\u2019s stressed and seeking help, you should provide that support instead of making judgements on her identity.", "YTA. Also you do know bisexuals exist right?", "How do you get from \"you don't care about my mental health\" to \"you're not even gay\"? \n\nAlso, are you sure you're in your 40s, not 14? \n\nYTA", "Yes! As a pansexual in the closet, all my favourite celebrities had the floppy 90s haircut and were very lesbian lite. It\u2019s not a coincidence that my first IRL crush that made me come to terms with my queerness was a very butch lesbian.", "And using an out of context comment her daughter made to someone else to justify it. Maybe Nala is a weird kisser, maybe your daughter doesn\u2019t like the way Nala kisses, maybe anything is this infinite universe of sexuality and feelings. Stop trying to box your daughter in and dismissing her agency OP.  \n\nYTA.", "Huge YTA op. Seeing as you seem otherwise supportive, you gotta know how messed up that was. How could you say something like that to her? Thinking it is one thing, but damn girl, that was a messed up thing to say to your daughter. You need to apologize asap!\n\nAnd what is Nala\u2019s plan? You said \u201cof course she has a plan\u201d and got angry but never told us what it is. Why does your daughter want to drop her extra curriculars? Is she having mental health issues. That\u2019s serious stuff! You need to take your daughters well being and choices more seriously. You\u2019re at great risk of alienating her permanently.", "Or she could be ace and trying to figure out having romantic feelings for someone while feeling weird about physical affection. Honestly it sound's like OP is more fixated on gatekeeping lesbians and diminishing the relationship by saying it's not real than the part where her daughter is saying her mental health is in a bad place.", "This, also maybe she's bi, pan, queer or any other sexuality, her interest in men doesn't at all invalidate her attraction to women", "All of this and many gay people, esp as teens, sometimes fall victim to acting under compulsive heterosexuality where they feel the need to act overtly straight, such as obsessing over boybands if they're a girl.", "Also, lots of straight teenagers end up realising as adults that they weren't just \"shipping\" a celebrity/fictional couple, they were into both members of the relationship.", "Gotta love those butches. They are doing the lords work.", "Yeah, I once dated a guy who kissed by putting his tongue in your mouth and just like, leaving it there. If thinking kissing him was weird made me not straight, then I\u2019ve had a lot of ex boyfriends since then that I need to apologize to.", "Technically at 18 it\u2019s not her business. As a mother myself I do think it\u2019s still our job to guide, influence and at times even push young adults in the right direction. But going off accomplished none of that.", "It's also possible that she likes girls but not this specific girl", "I don't like like kissing either.  I used to identify as bisexual because I had the exact save feelings toward men and women,  romantically and sexually. Turns out at the age of 39 I realized I'm asexual but not aromantic. I just didn't have the language to express that idea when I was younger. \n\nNot saying that the same applies to OP's daughter but glomming on to illustrate they're is a whole range of identities she could be exploring right now.", "This, I'm Autistic and find kissing to be a sensory nightmare, I do it because it makes my partner happy but I could happily go without", "Pedro is \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc \nOh no, do I get my queer card revoked now op?", "I agree with the failure to accomplish that. And after you say technically, I think you basically agreed with what my sentiment was with your following sentiment. \n\nIn this situation, her daughter called her and said her gf was telling her to quit. That opens the door for mom to be in her business in my opinion. The way it's written, it can be interpreted as her daughter was seeking advice or her opinion. \n\nEither way, OP never allowed it to be a productive conversation by going instantly nuclear.", "Right?!? I remember thinking \u201cmaybe I don\u2019t really like girls\u201d because my local dating pool was just not my style,", "Yes daughter was reaching out and perhaps suggesting it\u2019s too overwhelming too. Which is a concern. 18 is hard. Being away from home is hard too. Hopefully mother comes to her senses and fixes this", "Agreed."]}
