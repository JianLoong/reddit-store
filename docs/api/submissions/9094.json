I reminded her that without soccer she has no scholarship, and how she expected to pay for it. Well of course Nala has this idea on how to handle it. We got into a pretty heated argument over it.

From one 40-something lesbian to another: you screwed up.\n\nYou don\u2019t get to gatekeep what being gay means. You don\u2019t get to define your daughter\u2019s sexuality for her.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how open you are at home, it doesn\u2019t matter if you are right. It doesn\u2019t matter if your parents were homophobic assholes who threw you out and you made sure this kid could feel love and accepted every day. It doesn\u2019t matter if she is experimenting. **It is HER journey.**\n\nImagine if you were experimenting and claiming a label that felt safe- and your mom said to you: but you aren\u2019t really straight!\n\nAlso: she may in fact be gay. She may not. She\u2019s 18- she may just be starting to sort out romantic and sexual attraction. \n\nAnd while we are at it- Justin Bieber looks like half the lesbians I banged in college- so- his picture in her locker is proof of nothing.", "YTA\n\nFirst of all, it is entirely possible for LGBT people to be homophobic (and as the B in LGBT, let me tell you now that 95% of the shit I have recevied from fellow LGBT people is from the \"L\" section, so there are plenty of lesbian bigots out there).\n\nThat aside, what you are being here is a massive asshole. She might be a lesbian, or she might not. She might be bi, questioning, anything. None of that matters. If you have a problem with someone giving her what you percieve to be bad advice about her college choices, that's what you should talk about. The \"stop saying that you're not even gay\" comment was totally uncalled for and incredibly rude. Also, looking Nala up on facebook and texting her is waaaaay out of line. I'm not surprised she's not talking to you.\n\nI understand why you'd be worried about her dropping soccer if that's where her scholarship comes from. As her Mum, it's also totally fair to worry about your kid getting too serious too fast in your opinion. But you've really handled this all very poorly and now you're just digging the hole deeper. Where is your wife in this?", "I'm sorry, but WHAT!?!?! Massively, YTA. Your daughter could be Bi or Demi. So what!? The issue wasn't even about her choice of partner, it was about you invalidating her mental health. YOU made it about her sexual orientation.", ">\u201cstop saying that your not even gay!\u201d   \n   \n>  \n>she can love who she wants to love, I want her happy\n\n  \nThe cognitive dissonance here is staggering.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Your daughter could be bi or pan. Or asexual but not aromantic. Or lesbian and not like kissing. Or, sure, potentially straight but exploring her sexuality and relationships as a young adult which is absolutely her right to do.\n\nYou have seem to have some weird resentment about this or some calcified idea of what being gay is that Bree's actions clash with. You had a disagreement/argument with your daughter about college and it turned into an accusation against her sexuality that, whether permanent or transient, was not the issue.\n\nYou say you \"never meant to put your input in\" but this is certainly something you've been mulling over for some time and when you thought you had an opportunity to play that card in an unrelated argument you couldn't wait to slap it down on the table.\n\nFigure out your thoughts and feelings on this out because running back to her with \"I'm sorry I didn't mean it\" when you **did** mean it is only going to lead to this happening again the next time you feel resentful.", "It sounds like you handled a conflict (how to handle the sports-academics tradeoff) by escalating to something irrelevant. Bree\u2019s sexuality is irrelevant to the validity of Nala\u2019s plan. By dismissing it as \u201cthe plan of someone you\u2019re not sexually attracted to\u201d, you resorted to poor reasoning and weird name-calling. That tells me that you were unwilling or unable to discuss the plans on their merits, which is concerning, and makes you an AH here. Reaching out to Nala is also a strange move. What would you say to your mom if she had tried to call your girlfriend after telling you you\u2019re not gay?  \n\nYour homosexuality is irrelevant here. Your policing your daughter\u2019s sexuality, or claiming to know it better than her, is. \n\nYTA", "YTA. \"I was losing an argument so I dredged up something unrelated and hurtful to my own child, AITA?!\" \n\nYou don't get to tell anyone what their preferences are. \n\nWhat did you expect to happen? It'll probably be a long while before she cools off enough to contact you. Don't bother her in the meantime. \n\nAlso, her mental health comment makes me feel like soccer is just not what she wants anymore. It may be where her scholarship is coming from, but do you really want her miserable?", "My daughter is gay. I didn\u2019t have a flipping clue. She liked boys too. But when she came out as a high school sophomore, I believed her. It was never an issue with my husband or me. I can\u2019t believe I have to advise a gay a parent to  except their daughters choices. YTA.", "YTA- whether she is gay or not, only SHE knows. One lesbian isn't an expert on ALL lesbians Right or wrong on your assumptions, you've just completely disregarded and invalidated your daughters feelings instead of being the soft place to fall if this relationship goes south, which lets face it, at 18 years old is very possible. Don't be surprised if she shuts you out and doesn't come to you if her feelings change for fear of \"I told you so\". You also run the risk of her staying in an unhealthy relationship because she doesn't want you to be right.", "Wow. Yeah. YTA. A gay parent should know better. There's literally no excuse for this, and from your own words it sounds like your daughter is right and you don't care about her mental health. What kind of backward internalized homophobia led you to this?\n\nPlenty of women don't figure out they are lesbians until middle age or later. The fact that she behaved as most of her peer group expected while still literally a child doesn't invalidate her now.\n\nOh, and I'm seconding what the other woman said about Bieber.", "YTA. How is this seriously a question. Whether she's still a lesbian 20 years from now, or whether she's realized she's bisexual or straight or asexual, it is HER identity. You don't get to dictate it to her. You don't get to tell her she can't feel how she feels, explore, figure things out. No parent should ever do that do to their child, and it's so much worse considering you're also queer.\n\nYou really want to shut your daughter down from exploring her feelings and figuring out her identity? You really want to make her uncomfortable, both with her own feelings and with EVER discussing them with you again!?\n\nAnd what is up with your weird stereotypes. \"Lesbians don't like boy bands!!\" LMAO you couldn't even begin to guess how many lesbians I know that are obsessed with kpop boy bands. Contrary to the ugly stereotype, lesbians don't actually typically hate all men. Weird that you don't know that.", "YTA, you don\u2019t get to tell people what their sexualities are, it\u2019s not your place. That is for her and her only to sort out. YTA also for messaging Nala for basically a favor when it sounds like you were aggressive to her too.", "YTA . Ever heard of bisexuality or compulsory heterosexuality ?? Seriously , you should know better . You can be homophobic and gay , trust me . I see it happening alllll the time and you're a prime example !", "YTA. This is not your business, and was certainly not your business to comment on. Let your daughter figure things out for herself.", "Woah. The internet sees a new form of bigotry every day.\n\nI really don\u2019t want to have to explain why, but I will briefly spell it out for you:\n\n- you\u2019re LGBTQ+ yourself\n\n- your daughter, AT THE VERY LEAST as part of growing up, is experimenting with her own sexual identity and coming to terms with it as a newly minted adult. Wherever she may end up, she deserves your full support. (And I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s not gay at all. But you should have been there for supportive, open, and honest communication while she works to explore her own sexual identity as a teen and young adult.)\n\n- you still say she\u2019s not gay!\n\nYTA, you of all people should have been in her corner actively supporting her through what I thought you would have known is a difficult time for your own daughter, as I\u2019m sure you yourself remember the fear of people not understanding/not being accepted for who YOU really are.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m not sure if you can fix your relationship with your daughter at this point. You drove it 6 feet under, and fast.\n\nEdit: minor clarity.", "Yah YTA. Everyone\u2019s journey is different. And a lot of people are born with a not so clear cut \u201csingle sexual interest \u201c meaning: we don\u2019t all ALWAYS know. Exploring is key. \n\nAlso sounds like she doesn\u2019t want to play soccer anymore. Let her figure out her own consequences. You\u2019ve said the important reminder but now it\u2019s time to leave it alone", "YTA\n\nGay people can be homophobic the same way women can be misogynists.\n\nMainly by gatekeeping and saying there is a \"right way to be gay\" which is exactly what you did. So yes, your daughter's comment about you being homophobic could well be true.\n\nMaybe she's bisexual.\n\nMaybe she, like many other baby lesbians, fixated on non threatening, cute, soft male celebrities before realising their orientation. Pretty common so I hear.\n\nEither way you owe her a huge apology and good luck getting her to listen to you about her scholarship now after that level of damage.", "My sister is very gay and when she was a kid her walls were covered in boy band posters, she obsessed over them. You'd swear she was the most straight.", "YTA. It doesn't matter whether she's gay or not, it's not something you had a right to say. If she feels like she is gay right now, that is her reality and you have no say in it. She may also be demi- or asexual which does not take away from her being in a relationship with this girl.\n\nYou are denying her her own reality.
