English is my first language but I just suck at it haha.)\n\nSo as I was growing up, I would go to church every week and it was in another language I did not understand fully. I hating it and was always bored. \nSo I grew up having no interest in religion or church. My mother grew up religious (not crazy religious or anything) and would always sign me up for readings and making me come with her whenever she would go to church, about twice a month. \n\nShe said I can make my decision if I choose to believe or not when I am 18. Okay, fine.\n\n\nWhen I was 18, I chose not to believe and she said that I was still too immature and still had to come.\n\n\nI am now 23 and I still am forced to come with her and sit through it with no interest. My hearing is also declining (severe to profound in my left and right ears, so I can't even catch everything what they're saying)\n\nToday, on the way home from the cemetery (My father is dead and we visit the grave often), she told me we are going next Sunday because she is carrying the candles. I said I didn't want to go and that she knows I don't believe in religion. She said I didn't \"have a say\" and that \"Its one little thing out of your day\" and that \"I should do it for me\"\n\nI told her that I would rather lick the inside of a NYC dumpster than go to Church.\n\nShe of course got really upset, but eventually said \"fine, be like that then.\"\n\nSo, AITA for saying that? I feel kinda bad but at the same time, I feel I should have the choice to go and what to believe in and that shows how much I do not want to go.\n\nEdit: Ive talked to her again, more calmly this time. I said that the only reason I said that was to get my point across that I want to be an adult and make decisions on my own.\nEven my aunt has said to let me be independent multiple times to her.\nShe was annoyed, but she said it is my decision and she will stop bugging me to come with her for church and everything else. \n\nHopefully that gets her to open her eyes that I want to do things on my own without feeling guilty.", "created_utc": 1681144263, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12hnzef/aita_for_telling_my_mom_id_rather_lick_a_dumpster/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you still live at home, which can certainly make sticking to boundaries a bit more difficult, but she went back on her word when you were 18 and now at 23 she really has no more claim over you.

NTA because you're an adult and can do what you want and if she doesn't understand that then that's her problem, not yours.", "NTA- You're an adult with autonomy, and she can't dictate your life to fit her fantasy. I'm surprised you even willingly got in the car the first time after your 18th birthday, and beyond that if she thinks she can control this aspect of your life, what's next? \"I forbid you from seeing this girl because she's Jewish,\" or \"I forbid you from hanging out with friends because they are a bad influence!\" You're 23 and you need to stand up to your mother more. Next Sunday, if you're still feeling like crap you could see if if their zooming the mass, that way you can watch her with the candles from home, and at least it's a compromise that might make you feel less of an AH, but again you're not the AH.", "NTA. She asked, you declined. She escalated so you had to make your point clear; a dumpster is preferable \n\n\"Fine, Be like that then\" applies to her. She was \"being like that\" and didn't like the consequence of her actions.", "NTA but maybe this is her way of bonding with you? You did mention your father has passed and you visit his grave often. If is the religion she wants to shove down your throat, don\u2019t be mean about it, but make your stance known firmly every single time like an adult with no further confrontation. Don\u2019t entertain religious debate.

That's meaningless.\n\nHolding someone against their will is not a good way to inspire faith. It's cult behavior. She's trying Clockwork Orange you. Religious people like this don't seem to have a concept of real faith and good works if they think simply going to a building once a week will keep you from going to hell, or whatever it is you believe in. That can't be forced.\n\nPersonally, despite growing up in a church, I'm an atheist. I don't think believing in a god is something you can decide to do or not to do. It's can't be forced either way. But if someone has faith of some sort, either...\n\n1. They should know better by their own experience it can't be forced.\n2. If they don't, it probably means they were raised in a church from a young age and never actually considered their faith in any real capacity and have just gone through life brainwashed without actually feeling it. That's really the only explanation for such behavior.", "NTA. Clearly she was not respecting your decision, that you are more than old enough to make for yourself. Sometimes you need to phrase things in a more direct and abrupt way to get them to understand that others have different beliefs and can make their own decisions.", "NTA... you cannot force someone to a certain religion.  You cannot force people to liking church.

They ask me why, and I told them that they need grounding in one religion in order to better understand all religions and we often have long discussions about religion, belief, and philosophy.  They enjoy their classes, but it's when we get into the nitty gritty at home that we really have fun.", "Info: why are you still going to church? In what way are you forced at 23?", "NTA-as an adult you should be able to make all your own decisions and your mom needs to accept that. You shouldn't feel bad at all.", "NTA for not wanting to go\n\nBut you need to have a much more mature conversation with your mom about religion and why you no longer want to feel guilted into going", "NTA. Organized religions are all scams", "Info: how long your father died?", "NTA. Next Sunday be out of the house before church and don't return until after church. Repeat as needed.", "> She said I didn't \"have a say\" and that \"Its one little thing out of your day\" and that \"I should do it for me\"\n\nOK, then she can sit down with you and watch three episodes of *Broad City* every Saturday.  NTA", "NTA. She can't force you to go, it's entirely your choice. She should have stuck to her agreement to give you a choice at 18. \n\nFrankly, I've never understood why it's ok to force children to follow the religious beliefs of their parents. Political, philosophical and ethical beliefs should always be a personal choice - at any age.", "You are NTA. Your mother is the AH for bullying you into doing anything you don't want to do.  You're an adult and set personal boundaries; she is a major AH for not respecting those boundaries.", ">I still am forced to come with her\n\nShe puts a gun to your head and marches you into church? No, you're choosing to go and just complain endlessly about it.\n\nYTA for your childish comment. Grow up and own your decisions.", "YTA. You are an adult so your choosing to go is your choosing to go. Essentially, you insulted your mom just to insult her cause she responded as one should: fine.", "I would say that this is a \"give-and-take\" sort of thing. While you're correct that you're an adult and should be able to choose your religious beliefs and/or the commitment you want to give; I feel that this situation is something that you might want to reflect on and think about if you can make time to attend occasionally to help your Mom cope with the loss of her husband/your dad and just simply to make her happy and give her company. Truthfully, I have been in a similar situation, as I lost my faith in the religion I was brought up with; however, to date I still will attend for important events if only to bring my Mom a little bit of comfort and company, I remind myself that it is an hour or two out of my time every 2 to 3 weeks, and the woman who raised me for 18 years deserves that in my eyes.
