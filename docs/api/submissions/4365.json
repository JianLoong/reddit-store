Celiac has a genetic component as it is an autoimmune disease.  As the notes state the child is not to have gluten, more than likely they live with a gluten-free kitchen which means it\u2019s safe to assume the child has grown up never eating gluten.  Because they have not had gluten introduced to the diet, they are more likely to not be able to tolerate it AND they are more likely to have undiagnosed celiac disease because you can\u2019t diagnose celiac without having gluten in your diet consistently for a minimum of 2 weeks.

The mother of the child also needs to be informed so they can take appropriate precautions. \n\nAlso, as someone who has celiac disease, I would be LIVID if my child had been given gluten without my permission.  I have been accidentally \u201cglutened\u201d before and it is a horrible experience.  My husband has made me sick from kissing me and I\u2019ve gotten sick just from bread TOUCHING my food.  It\u2019s incredibly painful and I was extremely malnourished prior to being diagnosed because eating made me miserable.  For people who aren\u2019t aware, when you have celiac, eating gluten triggers your immune system to destroy the villi in your intestines which prevents you from absorbing nutrients in food.  Many children prior to being diagnosed can have their growth stunted as a result.", ">Ate McDonalds once for dinner after not having touched it for a year (a long time for me) and it felt noticeably uncomfortable.\n\nOMG, this was me today.

She does not get to make a decision like that. What if is could be life threatening to the mother?  What if it\u2019s not?  Either way. It\u2019s not her decision.

So even if the kid doesn't show symptoms yet, there is a chance she also has it. Celiac is an auto immune disease that worsens over time and with repeated exposure to gluten. It literally kills sections of intestine until the body is unable to absorb enough nutrients from food being eaten, at which point the more obvious symptoms start showing. So the damage might not be showing yet but still might be happening. Might be worth it to point this out to supervisors and your coworkers, and to keep in mind for future children.
