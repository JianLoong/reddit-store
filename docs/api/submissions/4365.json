I am going to tell ppl I can't eat steak, wine and I am allergic to money.", "NTA.  Your coworker was in the wrong.  You tried talking to her in the moment, and she brushed you off.  So reporting it makes sense as the next step.", "NTA!! \n\nGuess what... even if she's not allergic, it's not anyone's right to feed the child something that the mother has instructed them not to. \n\nIf she doesn't usually consume gluten, it CAN cause her some gastric disturbance.", "NTA.

The parent thinks the kid is not getting any gluten in their diet so if the kid starts to become sick mom will have no idea why", "Maybe not to the child - but to the mother via proxy who WILL react.

Tell the mother what happened. What she does with that info is up to her, but she has a right to know she is at risk of a flare-up.", "Actually it CAN pose health risks to the child.  Celiac has a genetic component as it is an autoimmune disease.  As the notes state the child is not to have gluten, more than likely they live with a gluten-free kitchen which means it\u2019s safe to assume the child has grown up never eating gluten.  Because they have not had gluten introduced to the diet, they are more likely to not be able to tolerate it AND they are more likely to have undiagnosed celiac disease because you can\u2019t diagnose celiac without having gluten in your diet consistently for a minimum of 2 weeks.  It\u2019s entirely possible that your coworker did harm to this child and completely deserved to be reported.  The mother of the child also needs to be informed so they can take appropriate precautions. \n\nAlso, as someone who has celiac disease, I would be LIVID if my child had been given gluten without my permission.  I have been accidentally \u201cglutened\u201d before and it is a horrible experience.  My husband has made me sick from kissing me and I\u2019ve gotten sick just from bread TOUCHING my food.  It\u2019s incredibly painful and I was extremely malnourished prior to being diagnosed because eating made me miserable.  For people who aren\u2019t aware, when you have celiac, eating gluten triggers your immune system to destroy the villi in your intestines which prevents you from absorbing nutrients in food.  Many children prior to being diagnosed can have their growth stunted as a result.", ">Ate McDonalds once for dinner after not having touched it for a year (a long time for me) and it felt noticeably uncomfortable.\n\nOMG, this was me today.  I haven't had Chinese food in 3 years and I Grubhubbed an order today.  Let me say, the results wasn't pretty."]}
