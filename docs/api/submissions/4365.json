Celiac has a genetic component as it is an autoimmune disease.  As the notes state the child is not to have gluten, more than likely they live with a gluten-free kitchen which means it\u2019s safe to assume the child has grown up never eating gluten.  Because they have not had gluten introduced to the diet, they are more likely to not be able to tolerate it AND they are more likely to have undiagnosed celiac disease because you can\u2019t diagnose celiac without having gluten in your diet consistently for a minimum of 2 weeks.

I have been accidentally \u201cglutened\u201d before and it is a horrible experience.  My husband has made me sick from kissing me and I\u2019ve gotten sick just from bread TOUCHING my food.  It\u2019s incredibly painful and I was extremely malnourished prior to being diagnosed because eating made me miserable.  For people who aren\u2019t aware, when you have celiac, eating gluten triggers your immune system to destroy the villi in your intestines which prevents you from absorbing nutrients in food.  Many children prior to being diagnosed can have their growth stunted as a result.", ">Ate McDonalds once for dinner after not having touched it for a year (a long time for me) and it felt noticeably uncomfortable.\n\nOMG, this was me today.

She does not get to make a decision like that. What if is could be life threatening to the mother?  What if it\u2019s not?  Either way. It\u2019s not her decision.

So even if the kid doesn't show symptoms yet, there is a chance she also has it. Celiac is an auto immune disease that worsens over time and with repeated exposure to gluten. It literally kills sections of intestine until the body is unable to absorb enough nutrients from food being eaten, at which point the more obvious symptoms start showing. So the damage might not be showing yet but still might be happening. Might be worth it to point this out to supervisors and your coworkers, and to keep in mind for future children.

I've always hated that just because the symptoms may be delayed that it's \"not as bad.\"", "I had undiagnosed celiac until i was 11. prior to this, my whole diet consisted of gluten because i was which i was sick with extreme stomachaches, diarrhea, any other intestinal problem most of the time. i am 15 now and still pretty short for my age (4' 9) and after i started a gluten free diet i have noticeably not been sick. and frankly, me and youngest sibling both have it. we have no idea who we got it from because both my parents do not have celiac and my middle sibling is also safe. while there is a possibility that the child may not have celiac, there is also a bigger possibilty that the child has it because her mother has it. add on to the fact that the girl hasn't had gluten in her diet her whole life (im assuming here because if i were to have a child id do the same). OP was totally right to report the worker, if the worker did this once, then the worker would do this again. NTA", "I was gluten free for years and went back on it to test for celiac and while I don't know yet whether I have celiac, I do know that gluten made me feel very much unwell for the first couple days back on it, even though once my body had adjusted I felt no ill effects. I would not have wanted to do that as a little kid outside of controlled circumstances.", "What works for your family doesn\u2019t work for everyone.  I understand and appreciate that you\u2019re able to do separate meals but I know that if I had children, they would have to eat gluten free because I eat gluten free.  I physically cannot keep up with making multiple meals, having multiple sets of dishes, and the constant cleanup to keep myself from getting sick.  As long as they have a well-balanced diet and receive all the necessary nutrients they need, there\u2019s no reason that the entire family can\u2019t eat gluten-free if that is their choice.  It\u2019s when you become dependent on the easy, pre-made stuff that it truly becomes an issue which would still be an issue even if they were eating gluten.\n\nWe don\u2019t know the dynamic of the family and who all may or may not need to be gluten free so it isn\u2019t really fair to judge the mother for the choices that their family has made.  And besides, gluten-free diets aren\u2019t just recommended for people with celiac or a gluten intolerance.  Many doctors suggest removing gluten and/or dairy from the diet in cases of inflammatory diseases because those foods can contribute to inflammation. \n\nI also don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to say that gluten-free is \u201cnot as yummy.\u201d  Yes, some gluten free food out there just plain sucks.  But there is so much more variety available now today than there was 10 years ago and I\u2019ve honestly found tons of food that tastes really good.", "Thanks and I\u2019m sorry to hear about your chronic Lyme - I deal with chronic migratory arthritis due to untreated Lyme.  My doctor believes that that is what triggered my Lupus to start which set off the chain of events leading to Celiac.  Autoimmune diseases suck.", "NTA People don't understand since gluten free is a fad. But who would gamble with a real case of Celiac disease. \n\nGrowing up I had a friend, if you put bread in the wrong toaster you had to throw it away. Traces of gluten would be a week in the hospital.", "NTA it\u2019s not for her to decide. The school better get their act together, if a child dies because of something like this there will be a lawsuit.", "NTA celiac disease is genetic, and often isn't diagnosed until after the child turns 6 years old.\nThe parent should be able to trust that their child is being cared for, according to their directions.\nYou did the right thing, and your coworkers shouldn't be working with children, if they can't be trusted.", "I had a bf who was vegetarian for about a year. He said he had a burger or some steak one day and it *destroyed* him", "Go to the director and report both.  It's  unprofessional  and dangerous  what your  colleague did and the assistant director  is unprofessional  af . They are endangering  the child  by not respecting  the restrictions.  I would  also warn the mother  so she ca remove the child  before  serious  damage  is done.  Nta  at all", "My daughter inherited celiac disease from her biological mother, who would always call it a gluten allergy. We had so many allergy tests done on that poor little girl, until they finally ran a full panel blood screen.\nIt took months to clear her system and get her healthy.", "That is good the the ah colleague  doesn't  know  for sure the child  doesn't  have it", "Thank you so much for sharing this information! I have celiac disease and lactose intolerance (both diagnosed when I was a baby). I have done quite a bit of research on the disease over the years, and what people were saying just didn't add up for me in terms of keeping a non-diagnosed child gluten-free. Both of my children began eating gluten after they were successful with other solid foods, and both have tested negative via the celiac blood test when they were about 5. I've wondered if my 13yo son should be tested again, as he is very underweight, but I wasn't sure if the blood results would change over time. For context, he is a picky eater and takes medicines that dampen his appetite, which alone could explain his low weight.", "This isn't my personal opinion, but my take from having a gluten allergic girlfriend, not celiac, mind you.\n\nLots of people don't eat gluten because of pseudoscience Bs and fad diets so most people think that you are lying or that its 'not that bad'. \n\nThe amount of times people denied the food had any gluten in restaurants is enormous, even though sauces are thickened with wheat flour (the most common example of 'hidden gluten' in our experience).", "\"The mother prophylactically removing gluten from a child's diet\" has to be the most hilarious typo I have read in a very long time! \ud83e\udd23", "I try to avoid red meat because since I hit my late 20s, my body just... rejects red meat about half of the time I eat it. I take conscious and calculated risks when I decide to eat it. Because I really do love it. I'd be pissed I'd someone snuck me red meat because my \"intolerance isn't real.\" \n\nAnd what I'll never understand about this post... why the fuck do you care??? Why does it bother you so much that this person doesn't want to eat something?", "Oh yeah. I can get somewhat frustrated by the gluten free diet fad, as, when a restaurant advertises gluten free food, 99% of the time there\u2019s a risk of cross contamination or, as you mentioned, add gluten to things that don\u2019t necessarily need them. And yes. Many people assume that having \u201cone bite\u201d wouldn\u2019t do any harm, but it does", "Here you go https://www.askamanager.org/2015/01/hostile-workplace-its-not-what-you-think.html"]}
