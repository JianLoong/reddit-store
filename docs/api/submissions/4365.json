The parent thinks the kid is not getting any gluten in their diet so if the kid starts to become sick mom will have no idea why", "Maybe not to the child - but to the mother via proxy who WILL react. Celiac flare-ups can be downright awful, totally understand why the mother doesn\u2019t want the child to have gluten.\n\nWhat if the mum has a nut allergy that triggers anaphylaxis? \n\nNTA. Tell the mother what happened. What she does with that info is up to her, but she has a right to know she is at risk of a flare-up.", "Actually it CAN pose health risks to the child.  Celiac has a genetic component as it is an autoimmune disease.  As the notes state the child is not to have gluten, more than likely they live with a gluten-free kitchen which means it\u2019s safe to assume the child has grown up never eating gluten.  Because they have not had gluten introduced to the diet, they are more likely to not be able to tolerate it AND they are more likely to have undiagnosed celiac disease because you can\u2019t diagnose celiac without having gluten in your diet consistently for a minimum of 2 weeks.  It\u2019s entirely possible that your coworker did harm to this child and completely deserved to be reported.  The mother of the child also needs to be informed so they can take appropriate precautions. \n\nAlso, as someone who has celiac disease, I would be LIVID if my child had been given gluten without my permission.  I have been accidentally \u201cglutened\u201d before and it is a horrible experience.  My husband has made me sick from kissing me and I\u2019ve gotten sick just from bread TOUCHING my food.  It\u2019s incredibly painful and I was extremely malnourished prior to being diagnosed because eating made me miserable.  For people who aren\u2019t aware, when you have celiac, eating gluten triggers your immune system to destroy the villi in your intestines which prevents you from absorbing nutrients in food.  Many children prior to being diagnosed can have their growth stunted as a result.", ">Ate McDonalds once for dinner after not having touched it for a year (a long time for me) and it felt noticeably uncomfortable.\n\nOMG, this was me today.  I haven't had Chinese food in 3 years and I Grubhubbed an order today.

The lack of education your co worker has is shocking she is not in authority to make these decisons. Not only is cross contamination an issue but coeliac is hereditary so whilst the child might not show signs just yet they could much like i did i was fine for 12 years and boom i cant even use products i.e shampoos , conditoners , or creams literally instantly burn my skin. You did the right thing reporting them stand you did nothing wrong only a parent can make these decisions shes not a professional or the parent.", "NTA. If DSS got wind of that, it would be on the centers' public record for 5 years. (So I've been told for where I work.)", "NTA- your coworker\u2019s actions opened the child care up to a lawsuit. What happens if the mother had a reaction as a result of her daughter eating it. It doesn\u2019t matter if she is allergic; if it is personal choice; or for religious reasons- the parent has every right to expect that the dietary restrictions of her child are being respected by the caregivers she is paying!!!", "NTA. Celiacs disease is considered hereditary.  Also allergic reactions don't present the same in each individual.  Just because she doesn't stop breathing or have hives doesn't mean  another reaction internally isn't happening.", "My children don\u2019t have celiac like me because I DONT give them gluten which will trigger the disease!\n\nThey do get some symptoms when they are accidentally contaminated.\n\nYour co worker is ignorantly triggering a deadly disease in a child who can\u2019t protect themselves.\n\nThis hurts my heart.\n\nReport her. Please.\n\nCeliac is a gateway disease to so many others!", "NTA. It\u2019s not up to her. She does not have a medical degree. Even if she did, the parent nor the child are patients of hers. She does not get to make a decision like that. What if is could be life threatening to the mother?  What if it\u2019s not?  Either way. It\u2019s not her decision. She is there to follow direction from the parent. She is jeopardizing your facility by making assumptions. You did the right thing.  Food allergies of any kind are nothing to mess around with.", "The mom could have a reaction\n I know people who react to the parts per billion. That kid gives mom a kiss and bam mom's intestinal villi die off. If she's had enough exposures it could cause bits of her intestine to die off requiring surgery. At the least she's in for profound discomfort. \n\nSince she actively knows and confirmed she knows that this child has a restricted diet and intentionally gave her gluten to farfet fhe mom she doesnt like, one could argue a case for assault.", "NTA and just want to poikt out that it is really hard to get a confirmed diagnosis for celiac, and it can be genetic. So even if the kid doesn't show symptoms yet, there is a chance she also has it. Celiac is an auto immune disease that worsens over time and with repeated exposure to gluten. It literally kills sections of intestine until the body is unable to absorb enough nutrients from food being eaten, at which point the more obvious symptoms start showing. So the damage might not be showing yet but still might be happening. Might be worth it to point this out to supervisors and your coworkers, and to keep in mind for future children. You handled this perfectly though, and as someone who has had people purposely feed me gluten, I would go scorched earth on that center if I was her Mom and found out. You might have saved yourself, the center, and the smarter coworkers jobs.", "If you scroll down from the top of any aita post, at the top is the post itself, (then maybe an ad) and underneath that is the judgement bot.

I also have celiac disease and people just don\u2019t seem to understand how serious it is.  It\u2019s not an intolerance, it\u2019s an auto immune disease with far reaching consequences, not just the immediate, obvious ones.  It is entirely possible that the child also has CD but is not showing symptoms, a \u2018silent\u2019 celiac, but the damage being done to her gut by the ingestion of gluten could still be happening.  If I were the mother of this child I\u2019d be inclined to consider this potential abuse/assault, it\u2019s deliberately poisoning a child with no comprehension of the possible consequences.  Your colleague should be disciplined and also given food allergy training.", "One way to rule out celiac (but not gluten intolerance) is a blood test, which is the ONLY way to confirm it according to my gastro.
