She's an AH for asking that.\n\nFinally, an invitation is not a summons.  If you feel that you cannot attend, then don't.  But expect backlash.", "YTA. She gave you a year's notice. You can stay with family. This isn't some random wedding,  it's his sister. \n\nMaybe you just don't attend but he still does? Tbh not attending a sibling's wedding is messed up.

Calling HIS parents to ask if you can stay there? Ask for a small loan from family? \n\nExtremely tight on money? As in you aren\u2019t doing anything extra (going to restaurants, movies, vacations) and necessities only?? \n\nConsidering that you had the financial means to move and buy a house (in this economy with the crazy interests) - I\u2019m kinda not buying that you couldn\u2019t save enough money for a 3 day trip that you knew about a year in advance? \n\nNot sure what kind of fancy hotel you\u2019re looking at but $260 can\u2019t be the cheapest option-especially when you can stay with the in-laws. \n\nSeems like gas is your only major expense. \nHow far is the venue - 300 miles?

Am I missing something ?", "YTA. \n\nWhy the heck did you decide to take it on yourself to tell his sister? It\u2019s his sister - it\u2019s his responsibility to discuss with her, it\u2019s his responsibility to decide if numbers can work, how to make it work, etc. \n\nAs a couple, you were given plenty of notice, it\u2019s his sisters wedding. He finds a way to go to his sisters wedding, and/or he discusses it with her.", "YTA. She\u2019s correct. This is immediate family and there was a years notice. That is plenty of time.

A sacrifice for family here and there for an important event is worth it.", "YTA. Her response was AHy but I get it; you're had ample notice that this was coming up and even now you still have time to save. Your bf should be talking to his parents for financial help if need be; you shouldn't be speaking to the sister in the hopes that she'd talk to family for you. Burdening her with your problem was wrong.", "You had no place in being the one to contact her about this. Your boyfriend should have had that conversation with his sister. YTA for that alone.", "\"Therefore I decided\".\n\nYTA - You should not have decided.   You are just his girlfriend.

I'm curious as to how you are budgeting for all the new expenses you're about to take on with homeownership...because there is ALWAYS something to fix.\n\nIf you had put away $2-5 a week in a jar you could have had enough for gas and a decent hotel for 2 nights..", "I\u2019m sorry, but ESH. You overstepped by going straight to the sister over your boyfriend\u2019s head. It\u2019s his sister, so he should be the one to handle talking to her, not you. You\u2019ve just created unnecessary drama by inserting yourself here. \n\nHer response kinda sucks and she sounds a bit entitled, but I can also understand where she\u2019s coming from with some of it. You knew about this for months and should have been a bit better prepared. I absolutely get not being able to afford to go to a wedding due to life changes and moving expenses. I had to skip a close friend\u2019s wedding last year due to somewhat similar reasons, though going to that wedding would also have required taking time off, plus airfare, hotel, ground transportation, food, and all other misc. costs, which I really couldn\u2019t afford at the time and felt extremely bad about. In your case, this is a few hours drive plus a hotel, which is significantly less expensive to do. \n\nThis is also your boyfriend\u2019s sister, not a friend or something. I honestly don\u2019t really blame her for getting annoyed with you, as it seems like you don\u2019t want to make any effort to be a part of the family and have no interest in coming to one of the most significant events of her life. Why are you stirring the pot here and potentially creating a bunch of drama between you, your boyfriend, and his family? Seems counterintuitive to me.", "YTA.  If you can\u2019t afford a couple of day driving trip you had many months advance notice for, then you bought way too expensive of a house and won\u2019t be able to afford any of the surprises that homeownership throws at you.", "YTA... it's his sister. Theoretically the wedding is once In a lifetime and you had plenty of notice. Use a credit card or cut out other unnecessary expenditures even fast food like items. If there's a will there's a way but it seems like you just don't want to go. This isn't one of those.. I don't want to go in to debt kind of things. I would use that excuse for a not so close friend.", "YTA. It\u2019s his sister\u2019s wedding ffs.", "YTA/ESH. \n\nIf you don't have the money, you don't have the money. YTA because you went behind your BF's back to tell his sister what the deal was. Sister probably thought that you were asking her for money - and you say in your post that you wanted her to ask someone else in his family for help, so she's not entirely wrong. \n\nI said ESH because sister didn't need to be quite so abrasive in her reply, and because pulling money from a 401K for a wedding is BS.", "YTA\n\nIt's a once a lifetime event for your husband's sibling. You had months' notice to make gas money and hotel stays work. \n\nI also have an issue with OP calling the bride to let her know the situation. That is not a SIL responsibility. That message has to be massaged in and really, he should have been the one to communicate with everyone in the family. Bride's responses were clearly more about I need my brother there, I gave you time, make it happen. \n\nStatement that your husband is a bit prideful and that's why you reached out doesn't sit with me. My guess is you and your husband are on different pages and this is going to play out in a way you don't enjoy.", "ESH what the bride said wasn\u2019t okay, but it was absolutely not your place to go behind your boyfriend\u2019s back.", "ESH.\n\nYou suck because it absolutely was not your place to make this his sister's problem.  The bride has enough on her plate, so if you want to stay with family... ask the family!  Or, because your boyfriend is a grown man who presumably wants to go to his sister's wedding, put the problem where it really belongs, which is in his lap.\n\nHe sucks because his sister gave a year's notice to avoid this exact situation.  He also sucks if he would rather miss his sister's wedding than ask for help from his family.  He sucks because he didn't handle this himself.\n\nSIL sucks because suggestions 1 and 3 are beyond the pale.  But she is absolutely correct to be pissed that her brother couldn't bother to save up a little here and there along the way when he had a full year's notice.", "ESH. You have had a year to save and plan. It\u2019s his SISTER. Her response was a bit rude, but why isn\u2019t he handling things? Why hasn\u2019t he called his own parents to ask if he can stay?", "YTA, I get it money is tight, you just bought a house, etc. that is his sister tho, and family should be important. You were given a years notice, if it was actually important that you attend you would have put a little money aside. I am on the other side of this currently being a bride and having problems with FH brother saying he can\u2019t afford to come. He has had more than a years notice and we dropped everything with a 3 month notice for his wedding. We went to his wedding even tho we couldn\u2019t afford it, it just meant one less project or can\u2019t eat out or whatever. We had to cut back for a couple months to recover but I could not imagine missing a siblings wedding (especially when you had plenty of notice)", "YTA - you only need to have one less (latte, fast food, order of onion rings) a week to have enough money to buy gas and a couple of meals.\n\nIt's his sister, maybe you could stay home? (but that only reduces costs by half the meals)", "I enjoyed the emphasis that you bought a house AND moved...you mean you didn't just buy a house and stay where you were?  \n\nAlso, YTA", "After reading a lot of responses you are most definitely TA. Just admit you don't care she's getting married and are using any excuse to justify not going. You could literally drive and sleep in your car for a night if you were too proud to ask to couch surf. You could pack a cooler full of food, since you claim you wouldn't even be able to afford to eat.", "YTA! Who misses their siblings wedding? And why are you deciding this? You aren\u2019t even married to this man. He needs to at least go. They prob don\u2019t care if you do. For the love do the right thing? Also how many times did you two go out to eat this year? How many times did you get Starbucks? Bam! That could be the savings.", "YTA. You had notice and time to save.", "YTA - My bio dad pulled the whole 'I just can't afford to travel to your wedding even though I had a year in advance invite.'\n\nIt sucked and yeah, made me feel shitty so I get where his sister would think you guys suck. Also, if his GF had been the one to tell me that he wasn't coming instead of him.... you overstepped.\ud83d\ude2c", "YTA you should have been putting away money, also I\u2019m sure you can stay home and he can go to save money, he can just drive and take the time off work so he can drive it all and then he can crash on a couch or cot.", "ESH. you for going behind your boyfriend\u2019s back (not too much because eventually someone would\u2019ve needed to communicate the problem to her) and she\u2019s an AH for basically still demanding you to go to the wedding even after you explained the situation.", "I'm going to go with YTA because this should be your bf's decision. You decided to go behind his back to burden the bride with finding accommodations for you or hoping she'd just take it as roundabout way of RSVPing no. Obviously she overreacted and it's ridiculous to expect someone to get a new job or a loan to attend a wedding. But this conversation shouldn't have been with you in the first place. This is your boyfriend's family, he needs to decide what sacrifices he's willing or unwilling to make to attend this wedding. You're an asshole for butting in and causing unnecessary strife.", "YTA \n\nWith a year notice you can save some money for gas to see her wedding. It is family.", "NTA.

It was in a different country on a bank holiday, meaning flights were both very awkward, involving multiple nights stay and very expensive. We did everything we could to put money aside planning to go and then realised that while we technically had the money,, it was money we very much needed to cover bills, baby expenses and our house renovation fund. Luckily, my BIL and his now wife completely understood, and we will do something to celebrate together another time.\n\nYou do however kind of suck for going behind your partners back to the bride.

The reality is if you can\u2019t afford 2 nights in a hotel and some gas, you shouldn\u2019t be buying a house. \n\nWhat you\u2019re saying is that family doesn\u2019t matter to you and all you care about is your own home ownership.", "I was thinking this same thing. Maybe food (the bigger expense besides gas) would be cheaper that way.", "I'm wondering if the bride was being a bit sarcastic with the options. If I gave someone a years notice and then they called me to say that during that time I wasn't important enough to my brother to put $10 a week away for gas and a cheap hotel I'd be a bit sarcastic. This is hardly a financial crisis, we are talking about gas and a night or 2 accommodation that they had a year to save.\n\nUltimately, I think OP is an AH because this wasn't her discussion to have it was her bfs. It's his family, and he was the one who should have put the tiny bit of money needed away.

She\u2019s only invited because she\u2019s with him, my husbands only invited to my family things because he\u2019s with me. So there is a primary guest in these situations and it\u2019s the person related \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I just stayed in a hotel and it was $130 a night and it was not even a nice hotel. Guess anecdotal evidence isn't the silver bullet you think it is", "Thank you. I'm genuinely in almost the exact same situation as OP and I have enough savings (or could budget enough in 6mo) to make this happen. My partner and I aren't married (not a priority), bought a house in August, moved, helped his mom move across the country back to us (road trip with our 100lb dog), and I could spare $500 for a wedding for my family in that time. We also have 10 animals and not the highest paying jobs, plus live in a high COL area.", "It sounds to me like his balls are in a jar and she decided that the money should be better spent elsewhere or else?", "You can tell who has a lot of vacation time and doesn't have to worry about not working = not getting paid.", "Even if that's the case, what can they do about it now? Call the people they bought it from and ask for takesie-backsies?", "Maybe they just can\u2019t afford to travel to a wedding", "He should go alone, so it's easier to accommodate! Also, it would cut expenses in half. \n\nAlso, why did YOU talk to her? Not him? \n\nHer suggestions are unreasonable, but I can understand being upset cause your brother won't attend your wedding!", "I'm also curious where this is, I've traveled and stayed at cheaper hotels across the US and there's generally an affordable option within an hour or less of your destination.", "No, but you still have some , LOL.  Though you're kind of proving my point that they could stay in a hotel for under 260 dollars so thanks.", "OP says it would be one night, doesn't mention vacation time. So that's how I can tell it's not relevant here.", "She's too good for a budget motel, calls them methtels.", "A couple years ago I was looking at staying at the outer banks around memorial day weekend. A holiday inn express was over $300 a night. We didn't go because I refuse to pay that much for a holiday inn express. It's a summer wedding. You never know how much prices go up for the summer.", "But what OP doesn\u2019t realize is money doesn\u2019t necessarily equal standards. I know someone who got bed bugs from the nicest $500 a night hotel in the city. I\u2019ve stayed at some rinky small B&Bs that were cheap and clean. If they were willing to actually put in an effort they could make the wedding affordable to attend. Her BF seems expensive on paper but not actually worth much \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "According to the Social Security Administration website \"In 2023, a person must have less than $934 a month in unearned income to receive SSI. A couple can get SSI if they have unearned income of less than $1,391 a month in 2023.  \nBecause a larger portion of earned income isn\u2019t counted,   \na person who gets SSI can earn up to $1,913 a month   \n($2,827 for a couple) and still get SSI.  \nAlthough we encourage people who already receive SSI   \nto work, people who work while applying for SSI based   \non a qualifying disability can\u2019t make as much in earned   \nincome. That\u2019s because their ability to work affects our   \ndisability decision. In 2023, a person applying for SSI   \ndisability payments who isn\u2019t blind, and who works and   \nearns more than $1,470 a month, probably won\u2019t be able   \nto get SSI.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni would love to hear how you think this constitutes a high threshold in the US.", "Travel can be pretty cheap. Grab a bus ticket and stay with family. You\u2019re just petty."]}
