She's an AH for asking that.\n\nFinally, an invitation is not a summons.  If you feel that you cannot attend, then don't.  But expect backlash.", "YTA. She gave you a year's notice. You can stay with family. This isn't some random wedding,  it's his sister. \n\nMaybe you just don't attend but he still does? Tbh not attending a sibling's wedding is messed up.

Calling HIS parents to ask if you can stay there? Ask for a small loan from family? \n\nExtremely tight on money? As in you aren\u2019t doing anything extra (going to restaurants, movies, vacations) and necessities only?? \n\nConsidering that you had the financial means to move and buy a house (in this economy with the crazy interests) - I\u2019m kinda not buying that you couldn\u2019t save enough money for a 3 day trip that you knew about a year in advance? \n\nNot sure what kind of fancy hotel you\u2019re looking at but $260 can\u2019t be the cheapest option-especially when you can stay with the in-laws. \n\nSeems like gas is your only major expense. \nHow far is the venue - 300 miles?

Am I missing something ?", "YTA. \n\nWhy the heck did you decide to take it on yourself to tell his sister? It\u2019s his sister - it\u2019s his responsibility to discuss with her, it\u2019s his responsibility to decide if numbers can work, how to make it work, etc. \n\nAs a couple, you were given plenty of notice, it\u2019s his sisters wedding. He finds a way to go to his sisters wedding, and/or he discusses it with her.", "YTA. She\u2019s correct. This is immediate family and there was a years notice. That is plenty of time.

A sacrifice for family here and there for an important event is worth it.", "YTA. Her response was AHy but I get it; you're had ample notice that this was coming up and even now you still have time to save. Your bf should be talking to his parents for financial help if need be; you shouldn't be speaking to the sister in the hopes that she'd talk to family for you. Burdening her with your problem was wrong.", "You had no place in being the one to contact her about this. Your boyfriend should have had that conversation with his sister. YTA for that alone.", "\"Therefore I decided\".\n\nYTA - You should not have decided.   You are just his girlfriend.

I'm curious as to how you are budgeting for all the new expenses you're about to take on with homeownership...because there is ALWAYS something to fix.\n\nIf you had put away $2-5 a week in a jar you could have had enough for gas and a decent hotel for 2 nights..", "I\u2019m sorry, but ESH. You overstepped by going straight to the sister over your boyfriend\u2019s head. It\u2019s his sister, so he should be the one to handle talking to her, not you. You\u2019ve just created unnecessary drama by inserting yourself here. \n\nHer response kinda sucks and she sounds a bit entitled, but I can also understand where she\u2019s coming from with some of it. You knew about this for months and should have been a bit better prepared. I absolutely get not being able to afford to go to a wedding due to life changes and moving expenses. I had to skip a close friend\u2019s wedding last year due to somewhat similar reasons, though going to that wedding would also have required taking time off, plus airfare, hotel, ground transportation, food, and all other misc. costs, which I really couldn\u2019t afford at the time and felt extremely bad about. In your case, this is a few hours drive plus a hotel, which is significantly less expensive to do. \n\nThis is also your boyfriend\u2019s sister, not a friend or something. I honestly don\u2019t really blame her for getting annoyed with you, as it seems like you don\u2019t want to make any effort to be a part of the family and have no interest in coming to one of the most significant events of her life. Why are you stirring the pot here and potentially creating a bunch of drama between you, your boyfriend, and his family? Seems counterintuitive to me.", "YTA.  If you can\u2019t afford a couple of day driving trip you had many months advance notice for, then you bought way too expensive of a house and won\u2019t be able to afford any of the surprises that homeownership throws at you.", "YTA... it's his sister. Theoretically the wedding is once In a lifetime and you had plenty of notice. Use a credit card or cut out other unnecessary expenditures even fast food like items. If there's a will there's a way but it seems like you just don't want to go. This isn't one of those.. I don't want to go in to debt kind of things. I would use that excuse for a not so close friend.", "YTA. It\u2019s his sister\u2019s wedding ffs.", "YTA/ESH. \n\nIf you don't have the money, you don't have the money. YTA because you went behind your BF's back to tell his sister what the deal was. Sister probably thought that you were asking her for money - and you say in your post that you wanted her to ask someone else in his family for help, so she's not entirely wrong. \n\nI said ESH because sister didn't need to be quite so abrasive in her reply, and because pulling money from a 401K for a wedding is BS.", "YTA\n\nIt's a once a lifetime event for your husband's sibling. You had months' notice to make gas money and hotel stays work. \n\nI also have an issue with OP calling the bride to let her know the situation. That is not a SIL responsibility. That message has to be massaged in and really, he should have been the one to communicate with everyone in the family. Bride's responses were clearly more about I need my brother there, I gave you time, make it happen. \n\nStatement that your husband is a bit prideful and that's why you reached out doesn't sit with me. My guess is you and your husband are on different pages and this is going to play out in a way you don't enjoy.", "ESH what the bride said wasn\u2019t okay, but it was absolutely not your place to go behind your boyfriend\u2019s back.", "ESH.\n\nYou suck because it absolutely was not your place to make this his sister's problem.  The bride has enough on her plate, so if you want to stay with family... ask the family!  Or, because your boyfriend is a grown man who presumably wants to go to his sister's wedding, put the problem where it really belongs, which is in his lap.\n\nHe sucks because his sister gave a year's notice to avoid this exact situation.  He also sucks if he would rather miss his sister's wedding than ask for help from his family.  He sucks because he didn't handle this himself.\n\nSIL sucks because suggestions 1 and 3 are beyond the pale.  But she is absolutely correct to be pissed that her brother couldn't bother to save up a little here and there along the way when he had a full year's notice.", "ESH. You have had a year to save and plan. It\u2019s his SISTER. Her response was a bit rude, but why isn\u2019t he handling things? Why hasn\u2019t he called his own parents to ask if he can stay?", "YTA, I get it money is tight, you just bought a house, etc. that is his sister tho, and family should be important. You were given a years notice, if it was actually important that you attend you would have put a little money aside. I am on the other side of this currently being a bride and having problems with FH brother saying he can\u2019t afford to come. He has had more than a years notice and we dropped everything with a 3 month notice for his wedding. We went to his wedding even tho we couldn\u2019t afford it, it just meant one less project or can\u2019t eat out or whatever. We had to cut back for a couple months to recover but I could not imagine missing a siblings wedding (especially when you had plenty of notice)", "YTA - you only need to have one less (latte, fast food, order of onion rings) a week to have enough money to buy gas and a couple of meals.\n\nIt's his sister, maybe you could stay home? (but that only reduces costs by half the meals)", "I enjoyed the emphasis that you bought a house AND moved...you mean you didn't just buy a house and stay where you were?  \n\nAlso, YTA", "After reading a lot of responses you are most definitely TA. Just admit you don't care she's getting married and are using any excuse to justify not going. You could literally drive and sleep in your car for a night if you were too proud to ask to couch surf. You could pack a cooler full of food, since you claim you wouldn't even be able to afford to eat.", "YTA! Who misses their siblings wedding? And why are you deciding this? You aren\u2019t even married to this man. He needs to at least go. They prob don\u2019t care if you do. For the love do the right thing? Also how many times did you two go out to eat this year? How many times did you get Starbucks? Bam! That could be the savings.", "YTA. You had notice and time to save.", "YTA - My bio dad pulled the whole 'I just can't afford to travel to your wedding even though I had a year in advance invite.'\n\nIt sucked and yeah, made me feel shitty so I get where his sister would think you guys suck. Also, if his GF had been the one to tell me that he wasn't coming instead of him.... you overstepped.\ud83d\ude2c", "YTA you should have been putting away money, also I\u2019m sure you can stay home and he can go to save money, he can just drive and take the time off work so he can drive it all and then he can crash on a couch or cot.", "ESH. you for going behind your boyfriend\u2019s back (not too much because eventually someone would\u2019ve needed to communicate the problem to her) and she\u2019s an AH for basically still demanding you to go to the wedding even after you explained the situation.", "I'm going to go with YTA because this should be your bf's decision. You decided to go behind his back to burden the bride with finding accommodations for you or hoping she'd just take it as roundabout way of RSVPing no. Obviously she overreacted and it's ridiculous to expect someone to get a new job or a loan to attend a wedding. But this conversation shouldn't have been with you in the first place. This is your boyfriend's family, he needs to decide what sacrifices he's willing or unwilling to make to attend this wedding. You're an asshole for butting in and causing unnecessary strife.", "YTA \n\nWith a year notice you can save some money for gas to see her wedding. It is family.", "NTA.

It was in a different country on a bank holiday, meaning flights were both very awkward, involving multiple nights stay and very expensive. We did everything we could to put money aside planning to go and then realised that while we technically had the money,, it was money we very much needed to cover bills, baby expenses and our house renovation fund. Luckily, my BIL and his now wife completely understood, and we will do something to celebrate together another time.\n\nYou do however kind of suck for going behind your partners back to the bride.

If I gave someone a years notice and then they called me to say that during that time I wasn't important enough to my brother to put $10 a week away for gas and a cheap hotel I'd be a bit sarcastic. This is hardly a financial crisis, we are talking about gas and a night or 2 accommodation that they had a year to save.\n\nUltimately, I think OP is an AH because this wasn't her discussion to have it was her bfs. It's his family, and he was the one who should have put the tiny bit of money needed away.

Idk what all OP has going on, but some of y\u2019all have never had to pay for chronic health problems and it shows. I would *love* a year where I don\u2019t meet, come close to meeting, or just fully blow past my out-pocket max. And I have had the privilege of some *very* good health insurance plans. Aaannnd some not so good plans. Some years are harder than others.\n\nEdited to add NTA because I keep forgetting to actually say that. But obviously, OP, you\u2019re not TA.", "Are you having to pay for your meal at the wedding?", "Yeah, I think there is probably room to assume this conversation would have gone differently if OPs brother had initiated it and that the ridiculous suggestions were not real suggestions, but lashing out at OP specifically. Especially given sister ended the conversation by saying she would talk to OPs boyfriend. She knows there is a real conversation to be had, she just doesn\u2019t want to have it with OP.\n\nI also notice OP doesn\u2019t mention how boyfriend feels about ANY of this. Does he agree there\u2019s no money to go? Was he still trying to find a way there? Does he like that OP started this conversation without him?", "ESH\n\nIt's not even a big trip. You should have been able to budget for this amidst a move. Not doing so is basically saying \"I don't care about you and your life events\" to the couple getting married.", "In the middle of a move for a year?", "I hate when people say \u201cwe did our best\u201d. It\u2019s such a cop out and I have a feeling you know that. Doing your best would be not leaving it until last minute, taking it upon yourself to decline on behalf of both of you, and half ass throwing a plan together so it looks like you tried. Again I think you know all of this and I truly don\u2019t think you care either way.", "I'm glad we aren't the only ones. As much as we \"save\", it seems to be used. House repairs, car repairs and maintenance, doctor bills...\nI guess tax brackets have been clarified here \ud83d\ude02", "The YTA and ESH comments are so wild. Do I want people to attend my wedding if I invite them? Absolutely! 100%! Does that mean that I have the right to tell them that they need to get extra jobs or otherwise move heaven and earth to accommodate the financials if it turns out to not work out for whatever reason? *Hell no.* Life happens! At the end of the day, a wedding is basically a giant party to celebrate your love, and brides shouldn't want people to force themselves to stretch thin to be there.", "Exactly! You can safe all that you want but life happens! Sometimes there are unavoidable and unexpected expenses. But this should have been handled by the bf, not OP.", "So, scamming for benefits but can buy a house but can\u2019t go to a family wedding with a year\u2019s notice YTA", "How does your bf feel about this fight between you and his sister?", "So let\u2019s say for example if any of his family feel a vacation is more important to them than any future kids you have births, graduation, big life events, etc you\u2019re totally cool with that right? Because it\u2019s more important to them to relax or even do nothing than drop everything to travel to you?", "Am I to guess, that you have kids with a different man, get government assistance and he works?", "You said he has family who lives near the venue you can stay with. If you can\u2019t save up gas money for a road trip with nearly a year\u2019s notice what on earth are you doing buying a house? YTA for 1) going behind your bf\u2019s back to talk to his sister and 2) your bs idea that his family should pay for your travel.", "Doesn't need to be a fancy hotel... Are there no motels in the city where the venue is located?", "We just spent two nights at a resort hotel and it was $89 a night with breakfast included. If you wanted to go there are plenty of ways to make it work.", "how much is a shitty motel then?", "They bought a house.  They had money.  They literally only need gas money.", "But OP and her bf never asked for help, she just put bride in front of decision.\nHer bf should have reached family and ask if he thinks he needs it.", "It's completely ridiculous and this is why there are so many narcissistic people in the world. You're doing nothing wrong.", "Your situation sounds literally nothing like OPs situation. They had a year notice, and they bought a house. Evidently they're too good for motel 6. OP is an ahole. And so is her bf (pretty stupid to buy a house with just a boyfriend anyways looool)", "There\u2019s a certain kind of people who love to scream \u201cbut FaMiLy!\u201d at every corner like it\u2019s the most important thing in the world, but have no concept of what it actually entails. And that\u2019s sympathy, understanding, and actual help. Not the guilting and shaming crap, but actual collaborative help. The bride is clearly one of those people.", "No. Just for the nights staying there and the long trip up there.", "Correct. We moved. Then rented. Then bought.", "But it\u2019s also not just any old person, it\u2019s the bride\u2019s brother! I\u2019d be upset if my brother made zero effort to come to my wedding. \n\nAlso, presumably they\u2019ve already RSVP\u2019d in which case it is an asshole move to pull out. \n\nI 100% agree that suggesting someone get an extra job just to come to a wedding is madness and assholey, but it\u2019s also an asshole move to text your boyfriend\u2019s sister like \u201chey do you wanna pay for us to come to your do?\u201d. How jammy is that!", "The difference for YTA for me is OP reached out to the bride so the bride could ask the family for money instead of having her SO put his big boy pants on and handle it himself.", "There was no fight. Nonetheless, he is mad at his sisters suggestions. But overall, seems unphased by the entire situation.", "Neither of us have children. Both work fulltime jobs. I get assistance for Healthcare and on some other bills. He doesn't. Together, neither of us would.", "There is one. And 260 will cover a night there.", "We don't have an all-inclusive resort package option haha.", "Not worth bed bugs and blood stained meth beds lol. That's wild.", "The bf is refusing to ask for help. It\u2019s not on Op to ask for help on HIS behalf from HIS family, so *she* is NTA. \n\nShe took a tentative step towards this anyway, by reaching out to the bride outlining the situation, and got an earful she didn\u2019t deserve. \n\nFrankly she\u2019s NTA even if she didn\u2019t; it\u2019s not on her to regulate her bf\u2019s family dynamics.", "But if you\u2019ve been offered to stay at his parents house, then it won\u2019t cost you anything apart from travel money. I see her point. You\u2019ve had a years notice for this. Even sticking away a very little amount every month for it and you could go. It\u2019s awful if her brother can\u2019t attend her wedding. I\u2019d be gutted if mine couldn\u2019t. She\u2019s allowed to be upset by it.", "You would have to feed yourself anyway. Just buy groceries, don\u2019t eat at restaurants.", "A cooler with drinks & snacks & sandwiches.", "If you couldn't afford gas for a wedding, you shouldn't have bought a house.  You can't afford upkeep.\n\nAnd why are you the one communicating?   He should handle his family if you want them to like you. He handles his, you handle yours.  You don't decide on his sister's wedding.  YTA.", "Should definitely add the info that you bought a home", "Considering OP was expecting \"That's okay, I get it\" as a possible answer, it seems like the text was more along the lines of \"our finances aren't going to allow this\" than \"please pay for us\"", "I hope no one goes to any of your events.", "That is understandable.   I know someone here in my city who is doing that now (actually growing up a new a few, but those were barely hanging on) but this particular couple is not so good, he makes 6 figures and she collects assistance for her 2 from the first BF, don't know how it's going to go because I think the kids dad reported them for welfare fraud.   But it's California, I don't know if they do anything about it anymore other than cut off the assistance.", "If. That was the hope with talking to her. She would reach out to family so we could stay somewhere. I'm not close enough to them to ask. I was being shy I guess.", "Ohhh I actually misread the initial post as \u201cthat\u2019s okay, I got it\u201d ie pay for it.\n\nFair, she wasn\u2019t expecting the sister to pay for it. I do think it\u2019s off to expect the sister to ask around for them, when they could just do that themselves. I mean really the biggest asshole so far is the boyfriend who  seems useless", "He didn't want to ask his family for financial help, so you emailed his sister - who is probably in a frenzy of wedding planning right now - to get her to ask their family for help. I can see why she was upset.", "Why wouldn't your bf call his own damn parents? Finding wedding accommodation is the guests responsibility, it's incredibly rude to put that on the bride's shoulders a few months before her wedding. She shouldn't have to call around because your bfs too proud or too lazy", "You were actually hoping that by declining your boyfriend's invitation, she would read your mind and offer you assistance by talking to her family for you guys to have a place to stay? This means that the only thing stopping your boyfriend from attending is a couple nights stay at the Motel 6? \n\nHave you told your boyfriend what you did?", "He\u2019ll regret missing his sister getting married. If there\u2019s an option to stay with his parents, it\u2019s only going to cost you gas money.", "and your bf is \"too prideful\" to ask to stay with relatives?", "That\u2019s not her responsibility. Your bf should talk to his own family to see if they would be willing to help him out.", "It is not the bride\u2019s job to ask other family to pay for you to attend their wedding. I can\u2019t believe instead of your SO doing it himself you went to the bride.", "yeah, wouldn't it have made more sense to reach out to one of the other sisters? \n\nlike i get not reaching out to the parents. that's sticky. but why not reach out to whatever sibling he's closest to?", "Yeah. I agree with all that. It was a last resort considering the wedding is coming up soon. I got desperate to find a way to make it happen with clearly...little help from him. But that isn't the point here lol.", "Didn't decline any invitation. Yes I told him. Money is stopping it because he isn't going to stay at a methtel 6. Gas food. Travel is NOT cheap.", "Yep.", "I think it is the point tbh. Regardless of who is the overall asshole here, you shouldn't have had to get involved in this at all. This is your boyfriend's family, and his sisters wedding. If he wanted to go then he should be calling his family or finding cheap hotel rooms. If he can't afford to go, or can't find a relative to let him stay, or hell if he just doesn't want to go at all then it's his responsibility to communicate that with his sister and RSVP no. You're doing too much here in an attempt to pick up his slack, but it's just going to make the situation worse. Because now if he doesn't make it to the wedding, guess who everyone is going to blame? You.", "Hey look, I think his sister was out of order saying you should get an extra job just for her wedding, BUT\n\nCan\u2019t you (or rather your boyfriend) ask a family member if they have space for you? Then it\u2019s only gas and food - they\u2019ll probably feed you if they\u2019re putting you up - so that means just food for the journey, in which case you could just make whatever you normally eat and take it with you in a cool box for the journey up, and take plenty of long life snacks etc for the journey back so you don\u2019t need to buy a tonne of extra food.\n\nIf your bf isn\u2019t willing to ask his family for somewhere to stay, and you\u2019ve not done anything about this or said anything about the affordability of this wedding till just now, then YTA.", "Why didn\u2019t you book back when she invited you?!", "What is wrong with a motel 6?", "oi he needs to grow up.. hes the real AH in all of this. all he needed to do is ask to stay with family and that will alleviate most of your issues", "They would of blamed me either way. But you're right."]}
