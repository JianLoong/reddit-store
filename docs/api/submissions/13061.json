I may be extending too much Grace but I read it as possible OPs husband enjoys surprises, whereas OP doesn\u2019t care. OP wanted to get brownie points for attempting to throw a surprise party but did very little to actively hide the surprise. This left OPs husband in the position to have to pretend to be excited about a surprise he knew was coming as well as having to hide his disappointment in having a spouse that doesn\u2019t care about his feelings(from his perspective).

Also, he's an adult who knew his wife was planning a surprise for him so in hindsight, my analogy of kid and parent isn't quite fair. \n\nIt is reasonable to assume a kid would try to spoil their own surprise because kids don't understand the consequences of that.
