He very intentionally searched for information.", "So he monitors your online browsing and your movements when you want to shop, and is all \\*shocked Pikachu face\\* that he doesn't get any surprises?\n\nNTA.

Not only for snooping but for also being so hateful.\n\nI had someone I love working to surprise me one time and I accidentally figured it out (it was definitely an accident!! I love surprises!!) I would have never wanted him to know I figured it out. He was so excited to surprise me and had worked so hard to try to be super thoughtful about it - just like you are for your husband. I played the part of super surprised and my happiness was real because he was thrilled that he had planned a fun birthday for me and that made me as happy as the actual gift/dinner location. Isn't that what people who love each other do? \n\nYou are so sweet to try to make sure your surprise would be something he really likes! He's the AH for his treatment of you!", "He broke the secret to start off with by snooping over your shoulder to start off with. NTA", "NTA \n\nCancel the plans.

Cancel reservations, send back the gifts and spend his birthday somewhere fun without him.", "NTA - My husband and I are both terrible at keeping secrets but we\u2019ve still enjoyed celebrating with each other even if we figure out the plan early. Your husband is 40, if he wants a surprise party then he needs to put in the effort to not look when you are on the computer or out shopping.

You are not TA he ruined his own surprise. He did it on his own accord.", "NTA and you really are a sweetheart to put so much effort into this.

Cancel the birthday plans.", "NTA he sounds unappreciative.... he was all in your business while  online and going to the store.... geesh", "NTA. Cancel everything including the gift.

He doesn't deserve anything for his birthday if he's going to act that childish and mean towards you.", "NTA\n\nPlease cancel the celebration", "NTA. I hope he is a nice partner otherwise and it was the first time he called you dumb?

At this point I\u2019d just take someone else to the restaurant and give him something boring like a box of chocolate for his birthday and a frozen pizza that he can enjoy on his own.", "Yep, he sounds like a little boy snooping around for Christmas presents then whining that Santa isn\u2019t real when he finds them.", "That could be his surprise. \u201eMy gift to you: your freedom to plan  your future  - including future surprises - without me, mean control freak.\u201c", "Agree.

Your fancy dinner with gift will be solo - I'm celebrating somewhere away from you!\"", "That would definitely be a surprise lol"]}
