No spouse should be worried about getting \"on the bad side\" of their other half.  \n\nSweetheart, your body is working very hard at the moment keeping two people alive.  That is plenty to be getting on with.  If you do manage to make breakfast in the morning, fab.  If not then that's OK.  If your husband doesn't see it as OK then you need to talk to him about it.  Or talk to your family about it.  Do you have any family around?\n\nIf you ever need to, tell your husband that the baby isn't moving normally and you need to go to the hospital.

Honey, he is isolating you and making you dependent on him. It is NOT too \"stressful and competitive\" to find a job while pregnant. You're pregnant, not disabled.

My husband has never been so stressed that he needs to yell or get angry with me because I didn't have a warm breakfast for him.

Methods used can include intimidation, shaming or demeaning you, isolating you from friends and family, and preventing you from making your own decisions.*  \n>  \n>**Do abusers hide in plain sight?**  \n>  \n>*Abusers can hide in plain sight. Between periods of abuse, they can be pleasant and charming. To those outside their abusive relationship, abusers are often seen as \"nice\" people.*", "Oh Hon...You are wrong. He is definitely abusing you psychologically. I really hope it doesn't escalate for the sake of you and your baby. \n\nSAHM duties are supposed to be focused on the kids.

It doesn't mean your husband gets hot meals on demand and taking his stress out on you.\n\nNTA unless you stay, but you will become the AH the second that child is born.

He marries her, impregnates her, and ensures that she utterly financially dependent on him. Then he starts pitching fits because, at 8 months pregnant, she has made him a breakfast he has to heat up.
