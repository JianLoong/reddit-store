This girl makes no sense. It shows her as racist and xenophobic, the very least, ignorant most likely.

That's just how high school is, I am sorry.", "NTA", "Why do you think you\u2019re TA? What did you say in response to her? It sounds like you were verbally attacked and should report her for harassment. Am I missing something?", "NTA.  You got yelled at by someone who likely has issue of their own.  Doesn't sound like you instigated anything, and are trying to make yourself a better version day to day.  Do you thing.", "Victims of racism are not assholes. Just because someone is not white does not make them capable of racism too.\nCan't exactly understand how someone who's half black/half Chinese is white-washed either. You're not white lol.\nTheir argument is moronic. And I'd have reported them.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with you being your authentic self. You don't owe it to anyone to act in a manner based on how they perceive you should be because of your race. Your classmate is a hater, fuck them.", "NTA\n\nRacists often don't make sense in my experience, so don't read too much about the random insults thrown your way. \n\nIt's possible the others didn't stick up for you because of your past behaviour, though there is an air of anti Asian sentiment from what you've described, so can't call you an asshole for that.", "Info:  in what ways did your internalized racism manifest?

What did you do when you got there? Have you done anything to apologize or repair your actions? If you just expected people to forget because you have changed internally that is not how life works.", "NTA, the problem lies with her, not you. Racial slurs are unacceptable in any context. I commend you for owning your past mistakes and trying to be better.", "NTA.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and you are not whitewashed just because you don't use slang. The person who called you all those racial slurs is prejudiced against Asian people for reasons I don't know. I hate the fact that racial slurs against Asians is still somewhat accepted.", "NTA I'm glad you are working on yourself and acknowledging that you have been wrong to think/act how you have in the past. School is, unfortunately, like the most toxic social environment you could be in, it is for most people, but I see how for you it's more difficult than most. You can't go back and remake first impressions, so there will be people who never change their opinions of you even if you change. Or maybe she is just angry because how you dress/look/act goes against her set idea of how someone who looks like you should be. But that's not your fault and nobody has to adhere to other people's expectations. Just continue to work on yourself, and keep in mind that every person around you is a product of their circumstances and their minds are shaped by all the experiences that they have had. And everyone's experiences are different.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds similar to many comments that President Obama got when he was running for office. People (of many races) said he \"didn't sound black enough.\"\n\nWell, given that he was raised in Honolulu, where nearly half the population is native islander, I'm surprised he doesn't say \"Howzit!\" when he walks into a room.\n\nPeople have a lot of judgements and thoughts about how people should talk and act based on how they look. And that is not your problem.\n\nYou are dealing with your internalized racism. It's time that she deals with her externalized racism. But while you're waiting for her to be better, report her comments to the counselor and the principle (and your parents).", "ESH for being racist to the rest of your school, and for your classmate apparently being racist right back at you. I also can\u2019t say for them but you might be able to make some friends if you openly apologize to everyone for the way you\u2019d been acting. You can\u2019t just pretend that everything is water under the bridge, because clearly they either don\u2019t forgive you, or still think you\u2019re the same person.", ">(1) I was extremely colorist an racist towards myself and my peers. (2) I go to a mostly black school, and i understand why they would not want to associate with me.\n\nOP has a history of being racist, so we probably need more information on the argument she got into and what she\u2019s said to this specific girl in the past.\n\nedit: that doesn\u2019t excuse the current blatant racism from the other student obviously, but it\u2019s probably the distinction between ESH and NTA.", "this entire situation sucks. You were racist and in turn nobody likes you but now they\u2019re turning what you did to them back onto you .", "A bigot called you a bigot. NTA", "On the positive side, high school is relatively a short amount of your life and better things await you - although it absolutely seems to go on forever while there.\n\nAre there any extracurricular activities you are interested in? Yearbook, drama club (they always need people in the back if you don't want to be in front of an audience), language clubs, school newspaper, math club, chess club, I dunno - there are lots of ways to build relationships with other students.\n\nSometimes the local library has book clubs, art classes at local art associations, internships or PT work, volunteering, church youth groups (I live in New England and they were fine places to meet people, but some areas are crazy religious and I would expect such groups to be crazy as well, so YMMV) - there are other places to meet people and build friendships.", "NTA. That girl is rachet and ghetto. Who cares about her ignorant and racist opinions.", "Nta that\u2019s sad I would say something to your guidance counselor cause that\u2019s not okay at all you don\u2019t deserve that treatment. I can relate I grew up very much like you and the school system takes a hit on you.", "You can put your ego on the back burner and ask to speak to the class.  Open up about your racist start. Explain that those views were a defense you built up from a family relationship that was hostile to you (if that was the problem) and you didn\u2019t realize how wrong you were.  \n\nThen explain that various people at the school seemed to understand and helped you drop that insulting and racist perspective.  Further explain that you know first impressions count and are hard to overcome.  You are talking to the class about this to let everyone know you came to understand what a jerk you were being but have figured its too far gone an impression to fix.  So you decided you just want to be by yourself and not continue offending people with that ugly first impression. You want them to know you\u2019ve changed but you don\u2019t expect them to elect you student council president either. \n\nBias and tribalism are common to all human races and groups.  It helps to research the history of your issues and possibly present what you find to the class.  \n\nChinese labor built the railroads in this country and they were really abused.  Enslaved black people built the economy in the south and they were horribly abused.  Looking into the history of some African countries will be enlightening when it shows sophisticated civilizations along with simple societies.  The same holds true in China.  The same is also true of indigenous people in the US. \n\nWe are do conditioned to believe that many people experienced racism because they had no advanced qualities but this is very, very untrue.", "ESH.  This girl sucks, and you kind of burned your bridges by being racist first, which is unfortunate.  Has your growth been internal, or have you taken positive steps to apologize to those who you harmed?  It's not clear here if you have and the people you harmed don't believe you, or if you're just hoping to sweep all that previous racism under the rug since you feel you've changed.  \n\nIt's sad, and I'm glad you've worked through some/many of your issues.  Honestly you may just need to power through High School and start anew in college with people who don't have a history with you.", "NTA. Sorry you have to put up with this crap. I hope you find a place where people are more accepting.", "Unfortunately, since the other girl is black, everyone will jump on the \"Black people can't be racist\" card. (FYI anyone can be a bigot, not just those in power!!-I get downvoted for this, a *lot*). \n\nSo, while OP is most definitely NTA, and the girl was making very expected, ignorant, bigoted comments, there's nothing she can do except be careful and get through it as best she can and start a clean slate in college.", "This. I need more info.", "How do you know the other girl is black?", "I\u2019m with you. Something is missing. I\u2019m glad OP is better but what happened before.
