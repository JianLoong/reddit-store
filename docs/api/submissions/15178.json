Since then I've tried to make friends  with some of the girls at school but they all either ignore or make fun of me. Anyways yesterday, I was in English class and I had gotten into an argument with this one girl. She has never liked me, I understand why but, I just want to be left alone.  she had told me that I think im better than everyone else because im half chinese and  she called me some racial slurs (some that dont even apply to Asian people), told me to go back to japan (my last name is literally Chen) and never come back because nobody wants me here, called me whitewashed and nobody did anything.

This girl makes no sense. It shows her as racist and xenophobic, the very least, ignorant most likely.

That's just how high school is, I am sorry.", "NTA", "Why do you think you\u2019re TA? What did you say in response to her? It sounds like you were verbally attacked and should report her for harassment. Am I missing something?", "NTA.  You got yelled at by someone who likely has issue of their own.  Doesn't sound like you instigated anything, and are trying to make yourself a better version day to day.  Do you thing.", "Victims of racism are not assholes. Just because someone is not white does not make them capable of racism too.\nCan't exactly understand how someone who's half black/half Chinese is white-washed either. You're not white lol.\nTheir argument is moronic. And I'd have reported them.", "NTA. There is nothing wrong with you being your authentic self. You don't owe it to anyone to act in a manner based on how they perceive you should be because of your race. Your classmate is a hater, fuck them.", "NTA\n\nRacists often don't make sense in my experience, so don't read too much about the random insults thrown your way. \n\nIt's possible the others didn't stick up for you because of your past behaviour, though there is an air of anti Asian sentiment from what you've described, so can't call you an asshole for that.", "Info:  in what ways did your internalized racism manifest?

School is, unfortunately, like the most toxic social environment you could be in, it is for most people, but I see how for you it's more difficult than most. You can't go back and remake first impressions, so there will be people who never change their opinions of you even if you change. Or maybe she is just angry because how you dress/look/act goes against her set idea of how someone who looks like you should be. But that's not your fault and nobody has to adhere to other people's expectations. Just continue to work on yourself, and keep in mind that every person around you is a product of their circumstances and their minds are shaped by all the experiences that they have had. And everyone's experiences are different.", "NTA\n\nThis sounds similar to many comments that President Obama got when he was running for office. People (of many races) said he \"didn't sound black enough.\"\n\nWell, given that he was raised in Honolulu, where nearly half the population is native islander, I'm surprised he doesn't say \"Howzit!\" when he walks into a room.\n\nPeople have a lot of judgements and thoughts about how people should talk and act based on how they look. And that is not your problem.\n\nYou are dealing with your internalized racism. It's time that she deals with her externalized racism.

I also can\u2019t say for them but you might be able to make some friends if you openly apologize to everyone for the way you\u2019d been acting. You can\u2019t just pretend that everything is water under the bridge, because clearly they either don\u2019t forgive you, or still think you\u2019re the same person.", ">(1) I was extremely colorist an racist towards myself and my peers. (2) I go to a mostly black school, and i understand why they would not want to associate with me.\n\nOP has a history of being racist, so we probably need more information on the argument she got into and what she\u2019s said to this specific girl in the past.\n\nedit: that doesn\u2019t excuse the current blatant racism from the other student obviously, but it\u2019s probably the distinction between ESH and NTA."]}
