When I initially bought the property the back fence was rotting, allowing me to see into the backyard of my back door neighbor. I wanted to put in a new fence because the fence that was on the neighbors side was a 4ft chain link fence and I no longer wanted to see them due to prior incidents. The incidents: I own three dogs, they are all big (80-90lbs) and one of them can leap really high. I was afraid that any one of them could jump over to the neighbors yard and harm one of their dogs (they have two, one big one and a little terrier one). There is also the fact that all the dogs are extremely reactive to each other (barking, growling, high-tails), a behavior I do not want to enforce but the neighbor thinks is \"cute\". I have had four separate incidents with this neighbor because of the dogs. so I decided to put up a new fence. The one i chose was metal so neither myself or the dogs could see the neighbor. The problem started when I put down the posts - the neighbor claimed I was building on her property and started a scene. After reviewing with the contractor, it turned out she was right.

The dogs are suffering. Perhaps having the alley between them would be a good buffer zone to set them at ease.\n\nYour neighbor has helped themselves to a public area that they knew was not theirs. They told you it is an alleyway. Their choice to do the wrong thing with full knowledge that it is is wrong makes them responsible for dealing with the consequences.\n\nA best-case situation would be if someone else made the complaint. Do you know anyone who works for a public entity who would be willing to complain on your behalf like an emergency services or utility services agency who could report that they saw their access had been cut off? That way they can't as easily blame you for reporting it. \n\nRegardless of who is on record as reporting it, you are not obliged to allow them to take advantage of you just to keep the peace.", "If the alleyway is public then definitely report her to the county or city.

And if it is, are there any rules against her using your fence posts? \n\nNTA, just curious how much of an AH neighbor is ;)", "NTA, and did you check to see if the alleyway was vacated?

I had to take him to the emergency vet and I was covered in blood. That was at 8am this morning. Its 7pm now and I look like a warewolf. \n\nthat's 3k vs the 550 she had to pay. \n\nIf anything she needs to pay me.\n\nThis isn't the first time i've had trouble because of her and her dogs, and not the first time i've had to take my dogs to the vet", "That's the problem. The posts are on My property line, the other side of the fence there is an alley way so servicemen can walk in between the houses and work on the powerline posts stationed there.
