I told Lisa during that argument that she was a shitty friend and I wish she had been erased from her kids the way she erased her own best friend from us.

Dad and Lisa were distraught because one of their children together is sick and they were using that money to help themselves stay afloat. \n\nThey were enraged when they found out what I did and said I could have at least waited until my (half) sister was better.

They also kept the truth about you mom from you and tried to erase her very existence from your mind. The money sent should have went to you and your sister not to them unless they were going to use it on you and your sisters care", "NTA\n\nThey took money, cards and actually your relationship with your grandparents away, that's terrible parenting.", "This is a monster of dad and Lisa\u2019s creation. They lied. They deceived your grandparents and they were taking advantage. All you did was tell the truth. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your parents have been stealing money all their lives and are now incensed that it will stop. This theft never should have started, and they've profited from it far more over the years than they're losing by the flow stopping.", "I have sympathy for your half sister - she deserves none of the shit currently on her, I'm sure. \n\nThing is, you and your sister didn't and don't deserve what your father has done to you over these many years. Reprehensible behaviour; in my area it wouldn't be theft (because guardians took the money gifts) but legal isn't ethical. Your father sucks, and IMO he's the biggest asshole here. \n\nNTA for telling the truth. Your father should be ashamed.", "NTA. Lisa stole from you and deceived you and your sister for your entire lives. This is a breach of trust that she may never be able to earn back, and she had to know that was a risk she ran when she and your father decided to lie to you and pretend she was your mother.", "NTA\n\nThat money wasn't for your half sister it was for you. Your grandparents deserved to know and now maybe they can help you learn about your mom", "NTA. Yes Liza raised you and was a good mom to you. But that does not give them the right to erase your biological mom. Your dad and Liza were close to your mom and they could\u2019ve done and amazing job at keeping your moms memories alive. Instead they chose to take you and your sister and cut ties with your grandparents they\u2019re the assholes.", "NTA What your dad and Lisa is truly awful. You had every right to tell your grandparents.", "NtA. Live your truth. Things are the way they are supposed to be now. It\u2019s their child their problem.", "NTA. They lied about your mom, lied about and hid your grandparents from you, and stole your money. Frankly, if I were you or your grandparents, I would quite possibly demand they hand over every cent of the previously misappropriated funds and threaten to sue if they don't. Their other child being sick is not your fault, nor you or your grandparents' financial responsibility. It is disgusting that they are trying to guilt you over this. They have absolutely no right to be angry at you when they are the ones at fault. They are just pissed they got caught. \n\nI'm glad you are in touch with your grandparents, I hope you continue to have a long and happy relationship with them. I hope your Dad and Lisa learn from this mistake, apologise, and spend the rest of their lives trying to make amends. \n\nGood luck to you for your future OP!", "NTA. They are horrible people. They just use your mom as a way to get money while they don\u2019t give a shit about her. Your grandparents should 100% allowed to decide what they want to do with their money and that\u2019s apparently not giving it to them.", "NTA. If your father and Lisa had been honest, none of this would have happened. They are meeting the consequences of their own behaviour; they've got some nerve blaming you.", "It is very sad that you grew up not knowing one of your three parents.
