Dad ought to be ashamed, but usually people like that don't have any shame to begin so I wouldn't hold my breath. \n\nI'd imagine there is WAY more than a DUI for cousin to be outright banned from Canada.

Welcome to Canada. If you need attendees to fill seats and eat meals you've already paid for, I can probably come.

Hence why I separated the paragraphs lmao \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nI will say though I hate destination weddings because many don\u2019t have the extra finances to book travel and accommodations so they miss seeing their loved ones married.

So she had plenty of time to hire a Canadian lawyer and figure out a solution. Your family only lives 5 hours from the border, and not attending a wedding is not the worst consequence she will be facing in her life as a result of being banned at the border.

Plain and simple and everybody should know that. She's one person and people cancel or can't make it to a wedding all the damn time. Plus, if you canceled you would lose a lot of money. Unless you're so well off that you can shrug that cost off, they know this and are STILL pushing you to cancel.\n\nAll of this sounds like there's some kind of panic amongst them about you having this wedding in Canada... or perhaps at the scheduled time. In any case, this much scrambling, entitlement, and vitriol is completely out of proportion to one younger cousin not being able to go because she fucked up. \n\nI'm very intentionally stirring the pot here. Something stinks in Denmark. Are there any other big events that you know of that your dad and Uncle would want to go to during your wedding?

For Canada, for what may be a driving offence in the USA, the equivalent to that is Operations while impaired.
