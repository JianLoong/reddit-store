I guess cousin won\u2019t be attending.  Doesn\u2019t seem to hinder anyone else from attending.  Sacrifice the one for the many.  She did it to herself.  If she\u2019ll be in serious legal trouble then there\u2019s more to the story than just a DUI.  She probably has fines that are unpaid.", "You should send a text to your cousin \u201cHey, since we\u2019re asking for impossible things, can you just go back in time and make better life choices? It would make it easier to not have this pointless drama leading up to my wedding! Thanks!\u201d NTA.", "NTA as long as you're okay with them not coming.", "Obviously NTA. Just as a thought, for my sister's transnational wedding she had a secondary 'wedding' in our home country for the people who couldn't come out for the main one in my BILs country. \n\nI mean it sounds like your family aren't worth accommodating that much even, but could be worth suggesting.", "Totally Y T A, everyone knows you\u2019re suppose to move your wedding to help out an idiot cousin who you didn\u2019t know got in trouble in Canada. You are the worst cousin ever. Sarcasm clearly, your NTA.", "Your cousin did something stupid and is dealing with the consequences.  It is NOT  your problem.\n\nYou are not selfish.\n\nThe family are selfish for even making the request..

It's just a wedding.\n\nSource:  am Canadian.", "NTA\n\nRelish in the fact that you are a *responsible* adult who has no concerns about crossing the border to have the Canadian wedding of your dreams, and gets to call all the shots since you paid for it. Your cousin and aunt are immature, and if they didn\u2019t want to come anyway, why are they putting up such a fuss? Those hypocrites are better left where they are\u2026.at home", "Your cousin's problems are not your problems.

I'd be so embarrassed about the DUI I would do anything to avoid bringing attention to it.", "NTA.\n\nYour family is insanely selfish and out of pocket for even suggesting this. Enjoy Canada, sounds like you'll have less and less reason to return after your move.", "NTA. You already booked and paid for everything! Are they going to give you all that money and time back? \n\nIf they were being nice, I\u2019d say maybe have a little party with them after the wedding, but they kind of just sound like jerks.", "Just seeing the apology makes me think you are Canadian haha", "Yup.

Haha", "Even if OP had known that their cousin couldn\u2019t go to Canada *before* everything was booked\u2026they still wouldn\u2019t be TA.

Former CBSA officer.", "Yeah it's interesting OP said they'd be in \"serious legal trouble\" if the cousin went back.

I once hired a subcontractor (that I worked with frequently) to do an installation job for me in Canada. He was turned away at the border for having had a DUI. Really screwed up the job schedule.

For sure there are warrants.", "Im in London/Uk so most people in Canada actually live south of me (London is about  Newfoundland) but Canada is always 'north' in my head", "It was humour I'm sure.
