Sadly, on this occasion, you've missed the opportunity.\n\nThat said, I can also see why , in the heat of the moment, you lashed out.\n\nShe's your friend. You both screwed up. Time to put it right.\n\nESH", "ESH - Yeahhh everyone sucks here to be honest.\n\nInstead of being supportive of you and your new happiness your friend chose to look at your new person as if she were assessing him for herself (gross) and not only that, she also seemed to do it in a way that implies that your judgement isn't sound? Dick move.\n\nMmm and then (while I understand your being hurt by her take on things) you didn't exactly improve the situation by clapping back at her, did you? She was being a judgemental B for sure but why throw it back at her and lower yourself to her level? You'd have been better off outwardly calling her on her shit, and then setting better boundaries for the future / possibly re-evaluating the relationship.\n\nAlso, that's my advice to you now - take a moment to think about things, decide how you feel and how you'd like to proceed and then talk to your friend about what happened. Let her know that she hurt your feelings a little bit, and if you decide you want to stay friends (which honestly I would, unless this is a straw breaking moment along with other issues you've got) anyway if you want to stay friends discuss how it was hurtful, how you'd have preferred her to react, and apologise for lashing out in retaliation too.\n\nThese little things happen in the moment between friends all the time, but the important thing is what you do with it and how you both learn and grow from it together. Best of luck to you OP!", "Your friend was always an arsehole - she just wasn't confident enough to be an arsehole when she was fatter. I've been thin, overweight, thin again...never changed my personality.", "ESH because her comments were wrong and you followed it up with an insult instead of just cutting it dead and telling her to pack it in.", "You both are somewhat being assholes. She started it by body shaming your new man (which was wrong), but then you did something you didn\u2019t like having been done! You could point out her behavior and tell her that these comments are really not ok, rather than stoop to her level. She\u2019s immature over all but you can\u2019t be proud of how you handled this.", "both of you are assholes", "NTA.  \n\n\nThis is classic case of \"She can dish it out but she can't take it\". If she doesn't like hearing about her weight then she shouldn't be judging people for their weight.  \n\n\nSome people just have troubles putting on body weight for various reasons and calling them \"too twiggy\" is just as rude as calling other people \"too fat\". Even skinny people struggle with their body image and calling them out for being too skinny and that they should put on weight can hurt them and damage their self confidence.", "Yeah, you totally stooped to her level on this one.\n\nESH.", "ESH your friend is TA for shaming others like it\u2019s gonna keep the pounds off and you are for body shaming even though she needed a wake up call. Are you guys teenagers? Be kind.", "NTA. Your other friend is right; if this friend goes around calling others fat despite her own stature, she had it coming - and she probably needs someone to help her get back in touch with reality.", "NTA you humbled your friend. Sometimes people need that to check their ego. What does make YTA is thinking fatphobia is a real thing. We should not be romanticizing the idea that it's ok to be grossly unhealthy.", "NTA. It\u2019s good she gained confidence but confidence doesn\u2019t come with rudeness. Maybe talk to her some more about her behaviour because there\u2019s a lot of calls coming from inside the house and she may be overdoing her personality to escape the person she was pre-workout.", "ESH \n\nShe drove you to a mean insult with her bad attitude.
