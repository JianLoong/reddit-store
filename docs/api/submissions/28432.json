On the face of it, you couldn't have predicted today's particular chain of events, but she's obviously sick of you flaking out on her for what she probably sees as less legit reasons previously.

You need something with an alcohol/acid to effectively clean it.", "YTA - it appears this lateness was the proverbial straw in a long list of bailing that broke your girlfriend. While you have a reasonable excuse for this instance, you are cumulatively the asshole. She isn't crying because you were an hour late today.

In the future, call to communicate with the person waiting on you, THEN finish your assessment of the car. Communication with your loved ones comes first.", "I do get it. That's why I think he should have allotted himself more time, allowing him to take care of the issue with minimal impact to his loved one. I'm also aware tree sap is sticky and hard to deal with; that, combined with having a brain in my head, is why I don't park under pine trees for days on end. Perhaps OP should exercise this strategy in the future.", "Not really. Why call before you have an assessment of the situation?", "Op is not the asshole for making sure he wants a safe car to drive. Not all trees always leak sap. It's just a bad timing situation and everyone is making OP feel bad since he added a totally irrelevant p.s about how he flakes a party. If that single statement isn't included, everyone would be on OP's side about wanting to safely operate his vehicle.", "Because you're going to be late. Apologize and say you found some weird stuff on your car, but we'll figure out what's going on and get over as soon as possible. Simple, not hard.", "No one said he was in the asshole for making sure he wants a safe car to drive. That's a straw man argument, and you know it.

Canceling on a steady girlfriend tends to make them jumpy, since you're not good at keeping commitments. \n\nIf you're not social and have no desire to be otherwise, find a girl who does that, instead of a girl who wants to go to parties and picnics.

You called her to let her know the situation and that you were going to be late. So why was she crying?\n\nHowever, you are an asshole in general if you cancel often. Don't make plans you don't intend to keep. That's an asshole move.", "ESH. You should've already tried harder and done better, enough for her to see it; she should recognize THIS instance truly wasn't your fault, and in future stop accepting behavior she finds unacceptable. In her place, I'd be canceling plans or starting them on time with someone more respectful and reliable.", "Unpopular but ESH- you sound like a nightmare to plan for/with, it\u2019s also annoying that you waited until there was 10 minutes left for a 10 minute drive. Nothing technically wrong with it per se but it just shows that you don\u2019t care enough to be prepared. If it weren\u2019t for that then you wouldn\u2019t be an AH. \n\nBut your gf also kinda needs to grow up, it\u2019s not like you cancelled last minute, you just had to clean your car for safety reasons and you told her that, yes an hour is a LONG time to wait, but you did tell her the plans would still go ahead.", "NTA. Unforseen circumstances. It's doesn't matter what you did on other occasions.", "NTA, for the obvious reason you mentioned. The issue wasn't known till you were at your car. Fragile little creature she seems to be. Handle with care moving forward.", "On behalf of all men\u2026 we thank you for your service", "I do wonder if you might have ADHD, simply because I know I really struggle with time prediction - like, figuring how long things will take.  ADHD isn't an *excuse*, it's just something to be aware of so you can try to figure out ways to still make life work. The logic of \"it takes 10 minutes to get there so I'll leave at 1:50\" *seems* sensible until you stop and think about the other factors that can take up time: walking to and from your car, finding your keys, putting on your shoes, hitting a red light, slow truck in front of you, waiting at a crosswalk, waiting for the elevator, etc. All of that adds time, even though we don't think of it.  Not to mention bizarre events like a rude pine tree!\n\nSo I really recommend starting to add \"just in case\"/incidental time to your estimates. If it takes 10 minutes to get there, leave at 1:45.  Give that 5 minutes for Stuff That Happens.  And if nothing happens? Well, it's way better to be a few minutes early than late, especially if you're trying to show your loved ones and friends that you respect and value them.   You CAN'T forsee what's going to happen, but you can *assume* something might, and leave early, to show that you care about her. \n\nI echo what a lot of people have said: you couldn't predict the pine tree needing cleaned, but it's apparent that your girlfriend isn't specifically upset about *this* incident, but about all of the other times she feels that you haven't bothered to make an error to be on time, or to spend time with her (e.g. the cancelling plans). She probably feels really disrespected and unimportant to you. \n\nYou couldn't help the pine sap, but I would recommend, one from person with time issues to another, from one introvert to another, taking a serious look at whether you're unfairly hurting your girlfriend, and try to figure out ways to have both of you happy.", "Had a quick look at his comment history.

That's basic politeness.", "Yep, this exactly. Now, if op was normally timely and this was a one off because of an unexpected situation, then I'd think the gf was unreasonable for being so upset -- but I also bet she wouldn't be so upset if this were a one off.

So your scenario actually never happened, and isn't relevant at all.", "Yeah but he took the time to try and scope it out. Guess it's two different approaches.
