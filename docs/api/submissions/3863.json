Logically think this through. He's disrespecting you over this little thing and isn't open to fixing it. Imagine what the future will hold. This is plenty of reason to move on, even though it sounds minor on the surface.", "NTA. I don't understand people in relationships who treat their partner like the live in maid. If you want a maid, pay for one. If you want to be parented, move back home. If you want a partner, understand you *both* live in the home and are equally responsible for all bills and chores. It isn't 1 person's job to do it all. Fuck.", "NTA. But you're getting a preview of what life will always be like with this guy. He will always be \"too busy\" to pull his weight, and you will always be the one doing everything, no matter how busy YOU are. I would put an end date on this relationship and make plans to move out.", "NTA I don't blame you one bit. Why should you cook enough to do the dishes and he benefits from when you cook. He's a grown man not a child. So start cooking for yourself. Clean the dishes when you cook. If you ask where his food is say he's a grown man and he could cook for himself. Or just order out. However you want to do it stop doing it he'll learn. And if not it saves you have to do any dishes.", "No one is too busy to do dishes. What's it like 10 minutes max if you do then daily?

Chores in relationships should be divided. It is the 21st century, you're not a housewife.\n\nIt all comes down to respect.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nHe is a grown man and being \"busy\" has nothing to do with this, it's called being lazy. He knows that if he won't do the dishes you eventually will. \r  \n\r  \nAs this sounds like a minor issue, imagine the rest of your life with this. Already I see resentment in you over this, and I bet it's not just the dishes he gets lazy about. You can't change someone, when they show you who they are, believe them.", "NTA\n\nHowever, is he cleaning up after he makes food for himself or do those dishes just sit in the sink too?", "NTA\n\nI clean as I cook though so all that\u2019s left when dinner is over are our plates, utensils, and a serving dish. Takes a couple of minutes. We definitely do the \u201cyou cook I clean\u201d thing.", "NTA!\n\nMe and my husband have a rule that if one cooks, the other does dishes which works really well. It's just down to mutual respect! Your partner needs to realise, you aren't his mother, you're his PARTNER. You should work as a team. If he doesn't want to pull his weight, I agree with what you said about just making food for you, getting you own food and he will have to sort him self out. Be true to yourself \ud83d\udc8c", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a boyfriend - you have a teenager. He needs to grow up and learn not only responsibility, but to respect you. Either that or he needs to live by himself.", "Nta. Good strategy.

This sounds suspiciously like the beginning of the end OP.", "NTA. He needs to grow up and do his fair share. He\u2019s 26. He has no excuse to not be helping do the dishes.", "NTA. You have things at hand too and yet make time for one little chore.", "NTA. I had roommates like this and eventually had to cook everything in the microwave on paper plates. I also had one clean fork I would wash separately. That way I never had to touch a single dirty dish that others left behind.", "[removed]", "NTA - at all!  As BF and GF you're supposed to be  team.  It is NOT supposed to be you caring and cleaning for him at all time.\n\nI was once married to someone with whom I split the household chores (thank God, no kids).  The list was posted on the fridge with room for checkmarks.  I prefer to do some chores everyday, and ex-husband wanted to do all of his on Saturday.\n\nI remember him coming into the living room and saying \"Hey, let's go clean!\" My reply was always, I have done my chores.  Check the chart on the fridge.  YUP we were divorced 7 years later.\n\nOnce I went on a 3 week business trip.  I came home to find an empty house with every dish and glass dirty, all littered all over the house.  I gathered them up, put them on his side of the bed, covered them with bedcover/quilt.  Then I went to sleep in the guest room.\n\nHe came home hours later, he had to be drunk bc he laid right down on top of the cover and all the dirty dishes.  He pitched a fit.  I told him to clean his CRXP up!  I don't know where he slept that night.\n\nI suppose I am saying what he's doing now, he will prolly do forever.

Girl you cook AND have work and school. if you cook for you both, then clearly he should at LEAST do the dishes. it\u2019s the least he can do since you cook the meals. It\u2019s all in fairness and that\u2019s not being fair to you. just don\u2019t cook for him. cook for yourself and clean after YOURSELF. your not his maid. he is a big boy and should clean up after himself.", "NTA but I will share my married viewpoint. The best thing I ever did for myself as a partner was look at issues like these as \u201cIs this really a him problem or a me problem?\u201d If it bothers me so much\u2026 it\u2019s probably a me problem. I adapted to our team needs, and no longer do things like dishes or unfolded laundry bother me - my boundary is I have to have a dishwasher and a nice washer/dryer. I need the tools to make the job easier for me, I have a little schedule I keep up with, and it doesn\u2019t even bother me anymore. For all the dishes and laundry he doesn\u2019t do, he is sure up in the morning with the kids if I need rest, mowing that lawn every weekend, or grilling which is not my forte. We each bring something to the relationship and figuring out how to best support each other is really best practice.", "I understand people like this perfectly. They definitely still want to get parented, but they can't go back home for that because there's one thing they can't get from their parents...a romantic relationship. People who do this are definitely trying to stay the young child they were at home when they didn't have to do as many chores, but still want the adult benefit of sexy times. People like op's bf need to shape up with this type of behavior or get booted out from an adult relationship.", "Don\u2019t move back home, give your mom a break!", "I've been in such a relationship and I would do everything in the house plus work very heavy shifts until the middle of the night. I once asked him to wash and hang the clothes because I really needed my uniforms to be dry until next morning. Which would be easy if he had gotten em out at 8pm when he finished his home office work. I get home at 3 am and my clothes are still in the washing machine. He's playing WoW TBC. And I'm the one overreacting. When I say once, I've never asked him to do anything for 3 years. And I explained several times why it was really important.", "And go a step farther if he cooks for himself.   Hide most everything.   Keep out two sets of silverware, cups, plates, bowls, and a single mixing bowl, pot and pan.    At least then if you do need to wash sometimes, it is not a huge amount, and he will need to wash if he wants to cook.", "It's vice versa actually :) \nBut 100% agree with this, NTA!", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
