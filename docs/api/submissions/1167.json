Our mother passed away from complications during the birth of my brother. I don\u2019t have any memories of mom. When she passed away, she left her estate to us, her children. The house were currently living belonged to my mother and technically belongs to my brothers and I. My father had an affair child(15). No one knew about her until a year ago. Her mother apparently went to a prison, none of her known relatives could or wanted to take her in. She ended here at our house. My dad took her in and she been living with us since.\n\nI hate her. She\u2019s nice to us when my dad is present, other wise, she\u2019s a fucking bitch. I didn\u2019t say anything about her behavior at first, because my dad has been treating her extra special. She can get away with anything. She acts like she owns this house, she\u2019s always in our rooms, wearing my clothes without asking and worst of all touching the items that belonged to my mother. I used to not say anything to her, just ignore her and stay away from her, but recently she\u2019s been so bold with her antics. I can\u2019t help but get mad at her and yell at her to stay away from me. My brothers just ignored her at first, but now are telling her to leave them alone, because how crazy she\u2019s acting. She constantly following us around, being mean and disrespectful for no reason. It\u2019s frustrating. My father is the only one not seeing that she\u2019s abnormal.\n\nWe had a family meeting, about how we\u2019re treating her unfairly and making her feel excluded. I told my father that she\u2019s disrespecting our boundaries and is going into our rooms without our permission. Which she argued that we go into each other\u2019s room without asking all the time. My brother(18) told her that we are siblings and our relationship is different, in comparison to her. My dad raised his voice for the first time at our brother, telling him he\u2019s outta line for saying that and that\u2019s she also our sister. I disagreed, I don\u2019t consider her my sister, she\u2019s a stranger to us. She\u2019s stranger living in our house for the past year, disrespecting us, it\u2019s not okay and she needs to go. It\u2019s unfair that we can\u2019t live comfortably in our mother\u2019s house, because of his kid. We don\u2019t want to be around her, because she\u2019s weird and a psycho.\n\nMy dad was furious and told us we are being unfair and ganging up on her. He left the room mad. She left crying, probably to get sympathy from my dad. My dad is still mad it\u2019s been like a week and he\u2019s not listening to us. She\u2019s the crazy one. No one was mean to her, she was the one being disrespectful and we retaliated, all of a sudden now we\u2019re the bad ones when we don\u2019t want to be around her. We never yelled at her for no reason, we haven\u2019t said or done anything disrespectful to her. I\u2019m not understanding why we are being punished when she was the one who was disrespectful. We stayed away out of her way, and every time she was getting more disrespectful.

She is living with a family she doesn't really know and doesn't seem to want to even get to know her. Her mother is incarcerated which is a huge trauma to a child. And she is being actively punished for the affair your (collective) father had. \n\nYou are not wrong for wanting boundaries. You are not wrong for not having a sibling bond with this girl. You're not even wrong for not wanting one if you don't want one. But I think everyone can take a step back and realize how messy this is and try and figure out a way to live in harmony, because she's not going anywhere. \n\nWhile you and your siblings own the home, its your dad who is paying for the mortgage (if there is one still) and the maintenance and running of the household.", "NTA. HUGE NTA.

He abandoned her, but kept being a parent to you 3. She's probably seeing your house, wondering why you guys deserve a nice house, stable parent, stable home, etc. When she was likely living with an unstable mother (assuming such since she DID go to prison long enough for custody to be transferred) and absent father. \nShe's probably wondering why her dad stuck around and raised you 3, but left her with her mother in a likely inferior and unstable living arrangement. \n\n\nIf your dad didn't already get her a counselor or therapist to help her adjust to this sudden lifestyle change, he should. And then ideally some sort of family oriented therapist to at least try and see if things can be made amicable. \n\n\nThat being said, it is YOUR house. While you could try to kick her out, it would likely mean your dad and 15yo brother would have to leave as well. Since your father is still their legal guardian. I'm not a lawyer, but I can see it being very difficult to force her to legally leave. \nBut it should give you enough grounds, to sit down and have a calm conversation with her... explain how the house is legally yours (not your fathers). And potentially get her to change her attitude. \n\n\nDefinitely try and get some locks for your bedrooms though. Buy some new doorhandles with keys on amazon or at home depot. They're pretty cheap and you can even get a set of 3 in the same pack so that each of you siblings have the same key. However, you'd have to be careful to not leave your keys around where she can get it. \n\nAnd/or get a locked cabinet and store precious items from your mother in there.", "Just start recording her when she's being awful.  Because your dad doesn't see her being awful.  He sees her being sweet and nice and you being standoffish and cold.  Then she complains that you aren't being nice to her, and he tries to make up the difference to her, which makes you jealous and angry.  And then she's rude to you as soon as he's out of the room.\n\nRecording could show him your side of the story.  Assuming that's legal in your state.", "NTA.

If your Dad has to stay there to take care of minors,he could be hard to get rid of. This is the issue. I think you are in pain( as you should be) to find out your Dad betrayed your mother. His behavior is disgusting. He obviously cheated on your mom, with the age of this girl.His other child ( while not her fault for being born), is HIS issue, not yours or your brothers.

I'll go ESH here.\n\nSince her mom went to prison, I assume that she didn't have an easy childhood and probably doesn't know boundaries.

You call her disrespectful, but then again you are being rude and disrespectful by calling her abnormal and a psycho. And this makes you an AH as well.", "NTA Assuming you mean that the house is legally yours and not your father's in any way, it sounds like you and your brothers need to remove the \"technically\" from your vocabulary and remind your father whose house he and his daughter are living in.
