Basically last semester my brother and his friends pulled a really mean prank and basically the principle told him that if he got in trouble one more time he was going to get suspended or expelled. Basically my brother set out on a mission to get with as many girls as he could before he graduates so he\u2019s basically asked out four girls since winter break or basically one girl a week. To me this is so gross and degrading to women in general.\n\nI told him I was basically going to tell on him if he did it again and he basically dared me to. So on Sunday he asked out a girl from church and I was like you\u2019re so done so I went to the principle and basically told him what was going on. The principle said that he would start giving my brother \u201csevere scrutiny\u201d but he can\u2019t expel him for \u201ctrying to get dates.\u201d I said what can I say to get him suspended. The principle said that I needed to mind my own business and then I got a call home.\n\nMy mom and step dad are so mad at ME for basically highlighting my brother when they KNOW he is basically just trying to graduate. I said asking out five girls in five weeks is not trying to graduate it\u2019s being a severe perv.

That\u2019s all you can do. \n\nThey can decide for themselves if they give him a shot, but right now you have this attitude of being a savior to the girls at your school/church when really you\u2019re just trying to snitch on your brother to the authorities.", "I\u2019m from Texas too, born and raised. How is he a creep for accepting rejection and asking other girls out? I would agree with you if he wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer or harassing them, but OP hasn\u2019t said that anywhere", "Being homophobic is being an AH, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily make you \u2018unsafe\u2019. You still haven\u2019t said how he is unsafe, yet you claim to have \u2018many\u2019 examples. \n\nIf you brother is a player, the girls at school don\u2019t need you to tell them. It\u2019s a high school for gosh sake. Gossip gets around! They already know.", "Well if he acts homophobic at school report him.", "Are you gay? Is that why you feel uncomfortable?\n\nYTA btw", "It sounds like it makes you uncomfortable, not unsafe. You're actively trying to harm his education and job prospects but keep claiming to be the victim. He didn't do anything to you (at least in this instance). I understand he represents the jock high school culture you hate, but that's just high school. It doesn't mean people should be expelled because we don't like them. He's allowed to exist even if he sucks.", "Not a single thing you have said makes sense. How is it unsafe for people who don\u2019t fit the mold? What\u2019s wrong with your brother moving on after a girl rejects him? Why does it matter if they\u2019re good looking? You need to move on with your life and stop obsessing about your brother. It\u2019s not good for your health or future.", "Why are you comparing the people he's asking out and you. Like are you jealous he wouldn't ask you, or people like you out?", "This comment here people like OP that \u201cdon\u2019t fit the mold\u201d\u2018explains a lot. So brother is a jock type popular kid and OP isn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t fit with those kids in high school either but I had my own friend group and didn\u2019t go out of my way to get them suspended. Tbh I didn\u2019t think about them much at all. Also this is your brother so I\u2019m really baffled why you did this. Just ignore him if you don\u2019t agree it\u2019s not your business.", "How does it make them unsafe?", "Like, what specifically? You can't just say he's unsafe and not say how? What exactly is it that he does that you deem so unsafe?", "What does asking girls out on dates have to do with January 6th?\n\nAre you high?", "Get some fucking help. You sound stupid.", "What does your brother asking out multiple young women have to do with January 6th? You\u2019ve lost me. Are you saying your brother was there, broke the law, but didn\u2019t get arrested; therefore, you\u2019ll find a way for justice to be done? That\u2019s the only thing I can assume for any of this to make sense.", "Please stop. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself. You may not agree with what your brother is doing. But you\u2019ve already went to the principal and he said there was nothing else to do.", "What on Earth are you talking about? What does him asking girls out have to do with Jan 6?", "LOL. He\u2019s just asking out girls and trying to get laid! Women do this too (god knows I have). Mind. Your. Business. There is NOTHING wrong with enjoying sex and trying to have more of it.", "I\u2019m sorry what? Mind your own damn business or you\u2019re going to absolute destroy any relationship with him. That\u2019s the best way to break up your family. YTA. Who gives a shit about how many people your brothers fucking or dating? Does he have an STD  that he\u2019s not treating or not telling women about and he\u2019s infecting every girl? If no then back off.", "It sounds like he's a typical player everyone knows about.\n\nRegardless, I'm not sure what that has to do with his education. Expulsions are usually reserved for violent encounters that actually threaten people's safety while they are at school.", "If he's asked out four girls in four weeks, they know.", "With the maturity level of a 10 year old", "Yes, you're an example of how women can be just as sexist and misogynistic as men.", "[removed]", "Sooooooo basic lol", "I did last year and they said they can\u2019t expel him for an opinion which is such crap they can they just want the clout of my brother going to college to be a pitcher", "Because they do things that make unsafe for people like me because they create a standard especially in Texas.  How do you think those girls feel about just being next or whatever. Because it means they are only being praised for the lions", "Did OP delete the \"he wouldn't date a trans person if he were forced to\" comment? As quickly as I saw it, I can't find it now. But that was gold and sums up the whole reason OP is upset.", "Its kinda incredibly sad just how jealous OP is of their brother for essentially being everything they want to be but cannot be/isn't", "I was just about to ask the same thing.  I get that he may be homo/transphobic, but he is also still a kid.  He may mature out of it.  Equating that with violently trying to overthrow a government is as I say to my cat oooooh biiig stretch. You are coming off as insufferable and self righteous OP.", "I was going to say unhinged.", "Yeah this is more something she should be telling mom and dad about, the principle can't really do anything", "Man, don't do 10 year Olds dirty like that. 6 at most.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Move on. It\u2019s not healthy for you.", "Do you go to the same school??\nYTA", "Go see a psychiatrist. You have some very serious undiagnosed mental health problems.", "Did you ever think that they need more proof than his little sister saying he\u2019s homophobic? Do you have videos of him calling someone a slur? Making fun of a gay student, harassing a gay student? Also, why would you think the school would care about him asking a girl out from Church? Two completely separate places, even if she goes to the same school.", "Maybe they want a high body count too?  Women get sexual urges as well.  Not all of us want romance.  Sometimes we just need to get laid", "Moving on after asking out someone is the nature of dating. He\u2019s not going to pine over someone that rejects him. That would be creepy. And who is this \u201cthey\u201d you keep talking about? every person in Texas isn\u2019t trying to hunt you down.", "So, if your brother was asking out non \u201cgood looking\u201d (your words in a previous comment) young women, would that be ok?\n\nListen, your brother sounds like he\u2019s probably a jerk who thinks a lot of himself. However, according to your own comments, he accepts when the young women say \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nYou don\u2019t like him, and he probably really doesn\u2019t like you. Stay in your lane, and wave goodbye to him when he moves out next summer.", "Are you gay or trans? I\u2019m still trying to figure out what you mean by \u201cpeople like me\u201d and about Texas.", "Like what specifically? What does he actually do?", "Yeah, it is still visible on OP profile. And explain everything.", "Yeah, \"my brother would never fuck me\" is a weird thing to get mad about", "She should be telling her brother's potential targets.", "Please stop internet diagnosing AHs with mental illness", "Also, so long as they're not discriminating against LGBT people, it is not the school's place to punish him for being anti-lgbt. Schools are not the thought police."]}
