Especially so horribly, it shows a lot about your true character? What, to respect the dead and their family instead of participating in a PR stunt?\n\nAdmitting bias, my school also had a classmate die, unfortunately. They publicised how close they were to the classmates and how they'll always be missed in the school. Then turn around like Yzma \"he ain't getting any deader\", even removed the plaque they had made because it was bad morale to remind everyone what happened. I've also had a lot of close deaths happen.\n\nYou didn't know her to remember and celebrate who she was. In my opinion, it would be more disrespectful to pretend to know the girl than to refuse participation.", "NTA not only are you not obligated to participate but it's not disrespectful to not want to try to pretend to have known about her. I actually think it's going to disrespectful that the class or school would try to forced students to participate.", "NTA. What you're doing is better because you remain truthful to yourself and are not becoming a part of the moment that those close to her need.", "NTA \n\nEven if you guys were close, maybe you wouldn\u2019t feel up to being apart of whatever they are organising. Everyone grieves different. \n\nYour not close: doesn\u2019t see disrespectful to me", "Nta, can't show fake love. God bless the family -nba yb", "NTA - It would be disingenuous to write a memorial letter for someone who you hardly knew, and a gesture like that shouldn't be forced on anyone. It's always sad when a young life is lost. Everyone is expected to grieve in a way, but to put the expectation on you to write a memorial letter is unfair. \n\nI suppose if it's really pushed on you, you could write a letter about how sad it is for someone so young to have passed without going into detail about the girl herself. But honestly, you shouldn't even have to do that.", "Good lord, you barely knew the girl and they're trying to make you participate in compulsory grieving? How about letting everyone process what happened in their own way?\n\nOf course it's sad when a young person dies but acting like someone's \"character\" is off because they don't want to grieve with the correct intensity, at the right time or in the prescribed way is just whacky and offensive.\n\nIf you wanna do something to make peace, glue some bird feathers into a card and hand it in, you don't have to write anything. Or don't do any of that, you're your own person ffs\n\nNTA\n\nETA: The ffs isn't directed at you, it's directed at the school", "NTA No one can force you to do something you don't want to, even if it is for a memorial. \n\nBut why not just write a letter and be honest in it. Keep it short and respectful. You didn't know her well but you had a sweet interaction during a project where she opened up to you about her hobby of collecting bird feathers.\n\nEverybody wins", "NTA. People grieve differently. Whether you knew her really well or barely at all, *how* you remember her and *what* you remember about her is a deeply private thing and it's not reasonable for others to demand that you perform grief in a particular way.\n\nIt might be worth finding out what happens with these memories. If they're being collated for her family or being burnt unread at some point. That may also inform what you're willing to do.\n\nI've been to a number of funerals where young people have died and attendees are often requested to write a few words that they remember about they individual, precisely because there is a younger family never who will never get to know their lost family member, and the shared memories from others are the only way they have of learning more about their lost family member.\n\nIf you are somehow convinced to write it, don't write that you were friends etc. Don't lie. Just tell one short story. Here's an example, with some placeholders and examples..\n\n----\nI didn't know NAME. I didn't even reliably remember her name. But I do know she loved collecting bird feathers. I found this out when we worked together on PROJECT with CLASS and TEACHER in YEAR. One day NAME showed me her box of bird feathers. EXPLAIN WHY, FOR EXAMPLE: We used to meet at her locker after lunch and then walk to the class together. She'd just found a DESCRIPTION feather during lunch, so she was putting it away when I turned up and she showed me. DESCRIPTION/STORY, FOR EXAMPLE: It was an old shoe box, I think. It was nearly full of feathers of all sizes from downy pigeon feathers to some that only fit diagonally. She said her most valuable dearest was this brown one that looked like a feather duster and she said it came from a Kiwi. Then she carefully laid it on top of the others. \n\nMORE STORY, FOR EXAMPLE: She said that she had always wanted to fly and then told me the story about Icarus' wings as she put the box away and we walked to class.\n\n----\n\nYou might be the only person to tell the people grieving her about her love of feathers. Maybe it will bring them some comfort.\n\nIt is unreasonable for them to insist you participate, but if you do, hopefully the above will be helpful.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t really know her. They should not have asked the entire class to write a letter, but rather a few people who actually knew her. Out of respect you should still attend the service, unless they give you more crap. In that case unfortunately you\u2019re going to be seen as TA but just know that you\u2019re not.", "NTA. The school should have invited \"anyone who wanted to\" to write a note or say something at a memorial. That kind of thing should never be mandatory.", "INFO - Are you, individually, being asked to prepare a letter? Or the the whole class being asked to write a letter, as the whole class, and you are being asked to participate in that group letter?", "nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nASKING you was fine, but you are ok to refuse. Nothing wrong with that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" and that it shows a lot about my true character.\" .. At least what you show about your character with that is completely fine (no info about anything else): You refusing to join into a meaningless gesture just for virtue signalling.", "Was this a larger class or a smaller group that tended to be more tight-knit? That may be factoring into their desire for you to say something.     \n    \nEdit: based on the answer, I'm going to go against the grain a bit here and say NAH. It makes sense that they asked, given the small class size, but you also don't sound comfortable with the idea and it's totally okay to say no. I suspect the only reason you're being singled out is because emotions are high after the (presumably unexpected) death of a fairly young person. ~~I would stick to offering condolences to her parents at the service by saying that you didn't know her very well but you're sorry for their loss, and leave it at that.~~ Saw you already offered your condolences, so I think you're good here.", "The memorial is to comfort those who knew her. Nobody cares about how much you know about her.\n\nYou can be honest and say that although you didn\u2019t know her, she did talk about her love of collecting bird feathers while working on a project.\n\nSomething a little nice done to comfort those who are grieving, won\u2019t hurt you. That\u2019s a human life gone.\n\nSo I go with YTA.", "it\u2019s a complicated situation so I don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re entirely in the wrong nor is anyone else. It\u2019s up to you.", "YTA\n\nThere are 11 of you. That you couldn't remember her name is ... Pretty brutal. \n\nInclude a poem about birds and mention how she loved them and their feathers.", "They're right.\n\nThese things typically require a short message. You can just communicate that you're sorry to hear of their passing and that you didn't get to know them more.\n\nWhen people dig their heels in about these things, 9 times out of 10 it is always about them and their petulance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
