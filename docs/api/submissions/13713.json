They publicised how close they were to the classmates and how they'll always be missed in the school.

It's always sad when a young life is lost. Everyone is expected to grieve in a way, but to put the expectation on you to write a memorial letter is unfair. \n\nI suppose if it's really pushed on you, you could write a letter about how sad it is for someone so young to have passed without going into detail about the girl herself. But honestly, you shouldn't even have to do that.", "Good lord, you barely knew the girl and they're trying to make you participate in compulsory grieving? How about letting everyone process what happened in their own way?\n\nOf course it's sad when a young person dies but acting like someone's \"character\" is off because they don't want to grieve with the correct intensity, at the right time or in the prescribed way is just whacky and offensive.\n\nIf you wanna do something to make peace, glue some bird feathers into a card and hand it in, you don't have to write anything.

Whether you knew her really well or barely at all, *how* you remember her and *what* you remember about her is a deeply private thing and it's not reasonable for others to demand that you perform grief in a particular way.\n\nIt might be worth finding out what happens with these memories.

That may also inform what you're willing to do.\n\nI've been to a number of funerals where young people have died and attendees are often requested to write a few words that they remember about they individual, precisely because there is a younger family never who will never get to know their lost family member, and the shared memories from others are the only way they have of learning more about their lost family member.\n\nIf you are somehow convinced to write it, don't write that you were friends etc. Don't lie. Just tell one short story. Here's an example, with some placeholders and examples..\n\n...\n\nI didn't know NAME. I didn't even reliably remember her name. But I do know she loved collecting bird feathers. I found this out when we worked together on PROJECT with CLASS and TEACHER in YEAR. One day NAME showed me her box of bird feathers. EXPLAIN WHY, FOR EXAMPLE: We used to meet at her locker after lunch and then walk to the class together. She'd just found a DESCRIPTION feather during lunch, so she was putting it away when I turned up and she showed me her collection. DESCRIPTION/STORY, FOR EXAMPLE: It was an old shoe box, I think. It was nearly full of feathers of all sizes from downy pigeon feathers to some that only fit diagonally. She said her most valuable feather was this brown one that looked like a feather duster and she said it came from a Kiwi. Then she carefully laid it on top of the others. \n\nMORE STORY, FOR EXAMPLE: She said that she had always wanted to fly and then told me the story about Icarus' wings as she put the box away and we walked to class.\n\n...\n\nYou might be the only person to tell the people grieving her about her love of feathers. Maybe it will bring them some comfort.\n\nIt is unreasonable for them to insist you participate, but if you do, hopefully the above will be helpful.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t really know her.

It makes sense that they asked, given the small class size, but you also don't sound comfortable with the idea and it's totally okay to say no.

Your feelings are not their business. Their approach to force you to open up shows a lot more about their true character.", "NTA. This school seems to be forgetting some things. \n\n1) If the only time two people are interacting is class and doing work for that class, they don't really get to know one another. There is no rule of social etiquette, in college, that requires people get to know their classmates. If one person doesn't actually know another, on a personal level, they cannot be expected to have much to say about them other than empty platitudes. \n\n2)The school has no idea what your interactions with the young lady were like, for you. Her fellow students could have found her to be a bully, self-centered, lazy, or any other kind of bad. For all they know, going into planning this, her classmates may not have one nice thing to say about her. I'm not speaking ill of this young woman, in particular; I'm just pointing out that people who suck also die. \n\n3) Everyone processes grief in their own way, and expresses grief in their own way. It's commonly accepted that there is no right or wrong way to grieve, therefore, your refusal to participate in their memorial activities cannot be attributed to your character in any honest way. The school cannot force people to express grief in a certain way, and it can be unhealthy for those being strong-armed to have to deal with their pressure. \n\n4) If a comment, letter, statement or whatever is only given because of pressure, then it would be necessarily disingenuous. \n\n5) Not everyone is comfortable discussing/reading/writing/thinking about death. Many people find find just the concept of death to be incredibly distressing, so they avoid it. In the wake of someone's passing, asking a person to do something that makes them uncomfortable compounds the stress caused by the death itself.\n\n6) People learn how to treat those who are grieving from the environment in which they developed. Your actions are what you believe to be appropriate, based on the social norms of your family and community. You have already done what you feel is appropriate, based on the culture of your community. So, assuming that you have informed your school of that fact, they aren't just insulting you, they're insulting your family and your community. \n\n7) In attempting to pressure and manipulate students into participating in the school's memorial activities, they are cheapening the gesture. It risks the activity being less of a memorial to show solidarity with and comfort those who cared about her, and more of a grief spectacle to create the illusion of caring, as a means of elevating their public image. \n\n\nI really hope that the attitude of the person you spoke to is theirs alone, rather than the attitude of the school administration, as a whole. Honestly, in your situation, I would reach out to whatever office handles student and school relations, and I would ask to whom I could make a complaint about that member of staff, because their comments about your character are nowhere near professional behavior- it was entirely inappropriate. Feel free to use the above points to tear the person a new asshole in your complaint. \n\nIf you believe that participating in this activity would be dishonest, distasteful, or disrespectful, the school should have the wisdom to honor that belief.

It's the people I knew during primary school, some of them all 12-13 years, who I remember.  Some of the ones I went through the whole journey with (or close to it) were among the first people to send me friend requests when I joined Facebook, a few of which I was surprised I had enough of an impact on that they would want to keep up with how I'm doing.\n\nThere's something about going through childhood together that's different.  Those people stay in your mind for life, just because of the period where your lives crossed paths, even if they weren't your BFFs.", "Did you not have a nickname that your remember her by? You're not expected to memorize all your friends middle names, no, but you probably called her something other than \"Hey You\". Write that.\n\nLiterally, all you need to write is \"Hey, <nickname> I'm going to miss you. You had a great eye for color and you loved bird feathers.\"\n\nNo, the school shouldn't force you to participate, but you're clearly an asshole.  Memorials are for the living - But not just you. Your teachers and friends would like your empathy. ESH.", "NTA\n\nYou barely know her.  You were respectful to her parents.\n\nI dont the the school (assuming US public school) can require such an act by it students.", "NTA, and whoever is organizing this \"tribute\" is clueless!", "I did have a nickname I called her. But it feels weird to reiterate what I said to her parents but less personal and to way more people", "NTA. In my opinion it\u2019s very disrespectful to pretend to know her when you really don\u2019t. You gave her parents condolences. That\u2019s all you truly should do. That\u2019s something a completely random person can do and be completely genuine. Good for you for having principles and sticking to them!", "NTA for your reasoning, but YTA if you put it as bluntly as \"absolutely not.\"  A better approach would have been \"I'm sorry, but I'm uncomfortable about speaking publicly about someone I really didn't know all that well.  I feel the eulogies are best left to those with special memories of \\[classmate's name\\].\"", "NTA but like just write about the bird feathers. \n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know her well but she did share her feathers\u201d\n\nDone and honest, I am sure someone in her inner circle will appreciate that her life did effect others.\n\nA girl at my college died and no one made a big deal out of it. I bet someone would like to know she gave away melted glass drips from the glaze on her pottery. It is a small detail but if someone asked I would give it. \n\nParents often treasure these details even if they don\u2019t seem important to you.", "NTA if the school punishes you for this, sue them."]}
