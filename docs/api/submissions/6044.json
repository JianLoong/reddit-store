Growing up i was a daddy's girl, I was his password, wallpaper and profile picture child. I was his tail as a child and went with him everywhere, people knew me as the apple of his eye. Unbeknownst to me for most of my parent's married life, they had issues and finally divorced when I was 12. My life (in my childish head) was crushed. I idolised and adored my father to the point whereby I resented my mother. \n\nAs I grew up and matured, I started to see things a lot clearer and struggled with feelings of disillusionment. To cut a long story short, I realised quite quickly in my older teen years (17) that my dad manipulated and gaslit me throughout my childhood and my mother was never the villain. Throughout my life he was forcing me to take sides in wars I should've never been involved in but at 19 I finally refused to take a side. He was abusive in every way but was a master manipulator.\n\nThis enraged him and our relationship never recovered. We had multiple meetings and conversations to mend our relationship where he'd shed crocodile tears but we'd always end up having a blowout argument where he would say awful things and we wouldn't speak for months. Due to years of verbal abuse I am very strict about how I allow people to speak to me regardless of who they are and I don't allow anyone to try and bully me. My dad disowned me multiple times and said countless awful things to me but I always forgave him because he was my father and I loved him. \n\nFast forward to my graduation. We haven't spoken in months at this point which was quite standard but I invited him to attend. My mom's husband who he despises for no good reason but has helped heal so many of my scars and has been more of a father figure will also be in attendance. This enraged him, we once again had a blowout argument and he called me his greatest disappointment. I have never been a cryer but I've shed more tears because of my dad than laughs with him. I finally gave up and told him that I will not continue to be subjected to his abuse and he's no longer welcome in my life. \n\nMy family thinks I am the asshole because of how harshly I spoke to him, that i chose stepdad over him and that I broke his heart. His entire family has disowned me and they're all blocked on my phone after sending me awful messages. He has had some health complications straight after and I feel like they blame me for this as well. My siblings have disowned me and speak badly about me and the situation. I don't think I am the asshole because I suffered years of his abuse and don't feel I deserve to be spoken to like that.\n\nEdit: my siblings still live under his roof and I feel like this is why they have cut me off. We have all experienced his verbal abuse but currently I am the only one financially independent enough to be on my own.", "created_utc": 1672429685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz9ma9/aita_for_uninviting_my_dad_from_my_graduation_and/", "score": 402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sometimes that is worth the peace of mind, and sometimes it isn't.", "NTA This is so much an echo of my own life. Honey, you are merely the first to cut him off, so you will suffer for it from family who will see you as the wrong doer and try to get you back into his clutches, but gradually others will also become disillusioned and see your example and also cut him off and things will get better. When you cut off toxic people, it makes room for better people in your life.", "You're siblings are just pissed because now they'll be targeted.

Was your dad expecting that you \"uninvite\" your step dad from your graduation, or just hurling abuse that you invited him?\n3. What type of relationship does your dad have with your siblings?  This is curious that your siblings are not on your side . . . I would presume that they had a similar experience with him.  \n4. What does your mom think of all of this?\n5. Are you at peace with the no contact and okay with never seeing your dad again?  And if so, would that change if he were to get seriously ill or worse? \n\nThe last question is to judge whether you will have latent feelings of guilt should you not attempt to reconcile with your dad, and then not have the opportunity later to do so.  Sometimes, even when we are justified in going no contact, we can later regret it, and then the whole argument for it in the first place feels less important and we focus on what we can never have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA, and im sorry, also FUCK YOUR DAD, as your post says \" he was abusive in everyway, but a master manipulater.\"", "NTA\nSorry, you do NOT deserve to be treated like this.", "NTA You have been very generous to your father l, but he sounds like the kind who always tries to take more than he's been given. \nKeep a lifeline out for your siblings, if they ever choose to break free of his gravity, but harbor no regrets for those family members who keeps themselves in his orbit.", "NTA. Good riddance.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this OP. It might be beneficial for you to also post this in r/raisedbynarcissists and do some research (if you haven't already) on narcissistic parents. I think the best thing you could do for yourself is to go no-contact with your father. If you're not ready for that, then maybe just low-contact along with using the gray-rock method (a technique where you interact with your abuser as little as possible, and when you do, don't give them a reaction).", "NTA, in my opinion you're getting a pretty good deal, cutting one toxic member of your family out and a few enablers are going with them. As for the siblings that still live with him... I'd be on the lookout for a tearful reunion with them once they have their own 'cutout moment' with dad...", "YTA for not elaborating on the family drama. It\u2019s so vague it\u2019s impossible to tell who is right or wrong.", "He is abusive how he is right? I mean you didn't even tried", "This is what it\u2019s like to be part of a narcissist\u2019s world. Get out or get on board. Of course you\u2019re NTA. Stop trying to make him love you.", "NTA \n\nFrom one person who\u2019s been through this to another, thank you for having the courage to step back and stop the cycle.", "Nta", "I almost never respond to posts, but I went through almost this exact situation with my father and sympathize with you heavily. The only difference is, I was about 13 when I was forced to realize my father was a terrible, manipulative man. \n You are NTA for sure. He was supposed to be the adult who loved and protected you, instead he manipulated and gaslight you in some of the most pivotal years of your life (so far). I, unfortunately, made the mistake of giving in and inviting my father to my graduation. Almost 4 years later and I still wish I didn't. \nGraduation day is about you, your hard work and all you've accomplished. Don't let his presence tarnish a day that is meant to celebrate how amazing and strong you are. Congratulations on graduating, OP. You are strong.", "Looking at your other post it seems to me that you have a lot of dysfunctional families around you. Learning good boundaries and keeping them is key. Therapy can help too. \n\nMy own family has a long history of addiction. It's helped me to learn how many families with addicts change to fit the addiction. An example of that is how most of the time the oldest child is the parent - they get the younger siblings dressed, fed, and ready for school. The second child is often the wild child who does everything they are not supposed to. Often time these kids grow up and explain that they behaved \u201cbadly\u201d to get attention diverted from abuse of other people in the home. Something like \u201cif I brake this plate then dad will beat me and not mom\u201d Understanding these types of issues helped me see the patterns in my family an step pit of these roles.", "NTA... you teach people how to treat you. Well done for standing up for yourself. Family that take his side are welcome to him. \n\nYou may someday be able to have a semblance of a relationship with him... I tried again after my dad had a stroke... after his first attempt at his old ways, I immediately shut him down. He treats me with respect now. It's not fixed but he is back in my life.", "NTA. Good for you.", "Had this experience. Just stop.  Don\u2019t acknowledge any opinions suggesting you need to fix it.", "NTA. Hugs, OP. Your dad sounds a lot like my mom, actually. It\u2019s important for you to do what\u2019s best for YOU. There\u2019s nothing wrong with going no contact. But if his health problems progress, you might also regret never speaking to him again if he passes away. There\u2019s really no correct answer to this dilemma and any choice you make will be hard on you. I would highly recommend speaking to a therapist if you do not already do so.", "NTA. \nI relate and sympathize with OP having a similar situation growing up except earlier realization (14/15) with my own father. \nThe hurt and shame I still feel remembering the messages sent to me by his family before they disowned me wrack me with guilt but it\u2019s easily shut down when I think of how much happier and healthier I am not having to walk on eggshells for those I love. My stepdad is my go to when I need something, he\u2019s my biggest cheerleader and he was there for me all the times my bio-dad wasn\u2019t. \nI\u2019m not trying to hijack OP\u2019s post, but I want OP to know that the heartbreak does end and from the sounds of it, they have a good supportive mom and step dad they can lean on. \nIn the coming times (holidays, birthdays and any other special time) be prepared for messages asking for forgiveness, or insisting he has changed. He hasn\u2019t. Don\u2019t break your boundaries, you deserve better. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this with your father OP, it\u2019s awful. \nCongratulations on your graduation!\n\nEdit: OP is is possible to have your siblings stay with you periodically/after school ? They could be feeling upset and like they\u2019ve been left to fend for themselves. Depending on their ages they might not have the capacity to understand WHY you had to place your boundaries, if they know they\u2019re not being treated right do they know they can do something about it/can they state they want to live with their mother if it\u2019s an option? If they live with him it\u2019s possible he\u2019s told them some version that makes you look like the bad guy. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to add that the kids are probably in a survival mindset since they\u2019re still living in an actively traumatic household. They might want to reach out to OP but fear the consequences of doing so?", "NTA. He's an abuser, his family and your siblings are enablers and you are better off without any of them (though I might suggest that your siblings might still be close enough to have his potential abuse of them 'normalised' and thus unable to sympathise because 'it's not happening to them'. I don't know the situation in this instance so that might not be the case but in my experience if he's abused one he's abused them all). It might hurt to cut some of them off, but since they've taken his side, do what you have to do to help your healing process.\n\nMay I suggest you look up r/raisedbynarcissists ?", "I don\u2019t mean to be a dick but it is your, not you\u2019re. You\u2019re means you are, ex: you\u2019re making a grammatical error. I swear COVID made this worse. It\u2019s something taught in like 1st or 2nd grade", "\"What type of relationship does your dad have with your siblings? This is curious that your siblings are not on your side . . . I would presume that they had a similar experience with him.\"\n\nNot OP, but I've experienced something very similar. The dad is a master manipulator, and the siblings likely haven't realized they're being abused yet. \n\nUnfortunately when you live with something for so long, it becomes your normal. I remember when someone first suggested I was being emotionally abused, I thought they were being ridiculous. It took quite a bit of analyzing past incidents and months of research into the topic before it really sank in for me.\n\nTo the siblings, though, it looks like dad hasn't done anything wrong. OP may or may not have been explicit about why, but she is changing the way she treats their father. This is shaking the boat and deviating from the status quo, and OP is an easy scapegoat for blame because if she just didn't treat him like that, everything would be \"fine\".\n\nNot going to assume too much for OP's case, but in my case, the unwillingness to acknowledge the abuse just caused my siblings to peg me as ungrateful. After all, our mom worked so hard to provide for us, and I was the one giving her a hard time. They likely thought my claims of abuse were unfounded at best and malicious at worst. It's been five years since I realized what was going on, and only one sibling has come to the same conclusion since then.", "NTA !!!\nMan- I have been through the same exact thing with my mom for the last 6 or 7 years, these back & forths that just go on & on & on. Proud of you for standing your ground & understanding there are boundaries to be laid for how our parents speak to us.", "Thank you! It also irritates me when people get there, their and they're mixed up, along with to, too and two!", "That was a very dickish comment and uncalled for. It could have just been a typo.  Phones are stupid.", "I checked their comment history, it isn\u2019t isolated.", "NTA", "Yta\n\nSounds like you're struggling to figure things out but calling people master manipulators doesn't tend to pan out as true.   \n\nIs your mom just gaslighting you back now?  \n\nWhy did your siblings choose to live with him?", "NTA you set clear boundaries and they were broken time and again"]}
