{"id": 6044, "submission_id": "zz9ma9", "title": "AITA for uninviting my dad from my graduation and telling him I never want to see him again?", "selftext": "\n\nI, 22f, and my dad have had a tumultuous relationship for the last 5 years. Growing up i was a daddy's girl, I was his password, wallpaper and profile picture child. I was his tail as a child and went with him everywhere, people knew me as the apple of his eye. Unbeknownst to me for most of my parent's married life, they had issues and finally divorced when I was 12. My life (in my childish head) was crushed. I idolised and adored my father to the point whereby I resented my mother. \n\nAs I grew up and matured, I started to see things a lot clearer and struggled with feelings of disillusionment. To cut a long story short, I realised quite quickly in my older teen years (17) that my dad manipulated and gaslit me throughout my childhood and my mother was never the villain. Throughout my life he was forcing me to take sides in wars I should've never been involved in but at 19 I finally refused to take a side. He was abusive in every way but was a master manipulator.\n\nThis enraged him and our relationship never recovered. We had multiple meetings and conversations to mend our relationship where he'd shed crocodile tears but we'd always end up having a blowout argument where he would say awful things and we wouldn't speak for months. Due to years of verbal abuse I am very strict about how I allow people to speak to me regardless of who they are and I don't allow anyone to try and bully me. My dad disowned me multiple times and said countless awful things to me but I always forgave him because he was my father and I loved him. \n\nFast forward to my graduation. We haven't spoken in months at this point which was quite standard but I invited him to attend. My mom's husband who he despises for no good reason but has helped heal so many of my scars and has been more of a father figure will also be in attendance. This enraged him, we once again had a blowout argument and he called me his greatest disappointment. I have never been a cryer but I've shed more tears because of my dad than laughs with him. I finally gave up and told him that I will not continue to be subjected to his abuse and he's no longer welcome in my life. \n\nMy family thinks I am the asshole because of how harshly I spoke to him, that i chose stepdad over him and that I broke his heart. His entire family has disowned me and they're all blocked on my phone after sending me awful messages. He has had some health complications straight after and I feel like they blame me for this as well. My siblings have disowned me and speak badly about me and the situation. I don't think I am the asshole because I suffered years of his abuse and don't feel I deserve to be spoken to like that.\n\nEdit: my siblings still live under his roof and I feel like this is why they have cut me off. We have all experienced his verbal abuse but currently I am the only one financially independent enough to be on my own.", "created_utc": 1672429685, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz9ma9/aita_for_uninviting_my_dad_from_my_graduation_and/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he can't respect you/your boundaries he can see himself out.", "NTA. you're acting like a responsible adult, he's acting like a spoiled child. He should know better.", "NTA\n\nYou have a right to remove your father from your life for what he's done. He sabotaged your relationship with your mother and hurt you in the process. But by cutting him out you're relationship with the other family members may have to change as well. Sometimes that is worth the peace of mind, and sometimes it isn't.", "NTA This is so much an echo of my own life. Honey, you are merely the first to cut him off, so you will suffer for it from family who will see you as the wrong doer and try to get you back into his clutches, but gradually others will also become disillusioned and see your example and also cut him off and things will get better. When you cut off toxic people, it makes room for better people in your life.", "You're siblings are just pissed because now they'll be targeted.

You\u2019re taking the right decision and should be glad that you\u2019re mature and sensible enough to realise all this.\nBlood relations don\u2019t necessarily need to be your family.", "NTA\nSeems like your procreator is good at manipulating more people than just you.", "I have some questions:\n\n1. Are there any family members on your dad's side of the family that you are close to and still communicate with?  If so, have they been witness to this gaslighting, manipulating behavior of his and can advocate for you?\n2. Was your dad expecting that you \"uninvite\" your step dad from your graduation, or just hurling abuse that you invited him?\n3. What type of relationship does your dad have with your siblings?  This is curious that your siblings are not on your side . . . I would presume that they had a similar experience with him.  \n4. What does your mom think of all of this?\n5. Are you at peace with the no contact and okay with never seeing your dad again?  And if so, would that change if he were to get seriously ill or worse? \n\nThe last question is to judge whether you will have latent feelings of guilt should you not attempt to reconcile with your dad, and then not have the opportunity later to do so.  Sometimes, even when we are justified in going no contact, we can later regret it, and then the whole argument for it in the first place feels less important and we focus on what we can never have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
