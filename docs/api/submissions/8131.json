I had to move in with my dad for a whole school year while my mom and ex stepdad were getting a divorce. I had a childhood friend there and we were pretty tight as kids. The summer before we hung out and everything was fine, but once school started she began excluding me from the friend group on purpose and getting her friends to gaslight me and contradict everything I said. One of her friends would poke me in the arm at lunch until it was red and stinging while she and the others sat there and said nothing, even though they could clearly see it. My friend would always tell me shed appreciate it if I just \"stopped following her around\" and called me 'annoying' all the time. She and her friends would host parties and would invite everyone in our class except me. And then they'd brag about how much fun they had in front of me. I had never felt so ostracized.\n\nJust recently, I get a Facebook message from this girl. She briefly apologized for 'being mean' and wanted to know when Id be back so we could catch up. I at first didn't respond, but after she sent me a few more messages asking me how ive been, I responded: \"Its nice that you've finally acknowledged you did me wrong, but apologizing years later doesn't fix anything. I do not want to be friends with you, so you should just leave me alone. Have a nice life!\"\n\nShe didnt respond, but also never contacted me again.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1674534708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jx5m3/aita_for_not_accepting_an_exfriends_apology/", "score": 270, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have every right to cut her out of your life, and you don't owe an explanation to her or anyone else. Sounds like a prick - I'm sorry that happened to you.", "NTA. Sounds like she was sooo much worse than just \u201cbeing mean.\u201d She was intentionally abusive to you and encouraged others to abuse you. I\u2019m impressed you were so direct with her, good for you.", "NTA. You let her off easy. And you're under no obligation to accept an apology. If she was truly apologetic, then she'd need to recognize and own up to what she did exactly beyond \"being mean\". Like i tell my kids, it's not enough to say you're sorry, you need to admit to what you did and why it was wrong.", "NTA. Your life, you choose who gets to be in it, and when it comes to someone who used to bully you, I can understand why they would be excluded. I hope she did change but that potential change doesn't absolve her of the harm she caused or allow her a space back in your life.", "NTA - those of us abused in HS or Junior high who were contacted by those in our classes who might not have been the best to us have to really wonder - what the heck did they experience in those interactions?   \nDid they forget the bullying?\nDid they rewrite it in their tiny little evil minds?   \n  \nIDK.   \n\nI have to admit only the ones who were at least somewhat nice get to see anything I ever post and I question my mental health when I let them in. lol  \n\n\nI absolutely feel with the level of bullying you experienced that you made the right call.", "NTA. This could be an altruistic gesture. Perhaps something recently reminded her about that time, and she's feeling bad. She's made an effort, you refused, and now you are both off the hook. It's also possible that she hasn't changed at all and believes you have something she wants or wants you to do. Either way, you are better off where you left it.", "NTA - you don't owe her anything, even after her apology.", "NTA - you gave a healthy response and protected your boundaries. Bravo!", "NTA - good for you for putting up boundaries and cutting her out of your life.", "NTA - there's a reason why we say we offer an apology, because we can we refuse an offer.", "NTA! Her apology can\u2019t undo the damage and there\u2019s no telling if she\u2019s changed.", "NTA \n\nGrowing up doesn\u2019t mean that those experiences no longer affect you. She may have grown up, maybe changed and apologised to you, but that doesn\u2019t make you obligated to accept her apology and act like those experiences are forgotten.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s your choice who you associate with and whether you give that second chance or not. I think this was very healthy for you to do. You were honest and respected yourself.", "NTA that's a reasonable position to take and a reasonable way to articulate it.", "NTA. She royally wronged you and you deserve to keep that toxicity out of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was nice of her to apologize and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s realized how toxic she was, but you are not obligated to rekindle a friendship from middle school from a place you lived at for a year. I\u2019m sure she understands and probably didn\u2019t give it too much more thought beyond that, so I wouldn\u2019t invest much thought or emotional energy into it either. The past is the past. Kids can be caught up in weird toxic bandwagon moblike behavior and that\u2019s probably what happened, and as she matured she probably realized it and wants to atone for it, but you\u2019re response was sufficient and civil considering what she did.", "NTA but consider forgiving your ex-friend for your own sake. You don't have to be friends with them but holding onto past trauma doesn't help you.", "NTA.  It was your choice whether to forgive her or not.", "NTA whatsoever. You put evil in its place on the back burner on high where it belongs. GOOD FOR YOU.", "[removed]", "some things you cant walk back", "NTA. Your response was fine and clearly worked. Well done.", "Maybe I'm jaded and spend too much time on r/antiMLM, but this smacks a little bit of a pyramid scam pitch. It feels like if she'd managed to keep the conversation going a touch longer, she was planning to drop an emoji-laden copypasted sales pitch for her clumpy spider leg mascaras or her dildo parties.\n\nNTA regardless, though.", "i've had people that treated me like shit apologize half assedly many years later just like she did with you, OP, so i get it.. you are NTA for reacting the way you did. don't need that toxicity in your life.", "The op act like a normal person here. Apology is not an order and doesn't have to be accepted. Furthermore, you are exceptionally cruel and evil. I'll just let the mod handle this.", "Nta. I had something similar happen to me. When the dude messaged me to apologize, I went through the trouble of planning for us to hangout. I blocked him and didn't show up.", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nI had a similar situation growing up. She apologized when we were in middle school and like an idiot I forgave her and continued to be \u201cfriends\u201d. It screwed with my self confidence for years. Fortunately I switched high schools before my sophomore year and discovered what real friendship was. \n\nGood for you not giving her a pass. I am sure your life has only improved since you got away from that toxicity. \n\nDose of Karma: the girl got heavy into drugs and ended up running away from home. She graduated 6 months pregnant.", "I had the same thought", "know exactly how you feel. been in the same situation multiple different times and it is not a good feeling. so i understand not wanting to forgive your ex-friend, after all that she did and didn't do and i know how it can really effect someone. but even when they do end up apologising, you remember what they did and what they've put you through. while it might have come off as mean to her, it was well deserved. final thought? NTA.", "NTA at all. Chances are those friends cut her out and now she doesn't have anyone to hang out with so she was reaching out trying to get a friend back. You did things exactly right.", "NTA. Your life your choice to accept or refuse her apology. Move on don't waste time thinking AITA."]}
