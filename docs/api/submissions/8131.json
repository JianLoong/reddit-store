I had to move in with my dad for a whole school year while my mom and ex stepdad were getting a divorce. I had a childhood friend there and we were pretty tight as kids. The summer before we hung out and everything was fine, but once school started she began excluding me from the friend group on purpose and getting her friends to gaslight me and contradict everything I said. One of her friends would poke me in the arm at lunch until it was red and stinging while she and the others sat there and said nothing, even though they could clearly see it. My friend would always tell me shed appreciate it if I just \"stopped following her around\" and called me 'annoying' all the time. She and her friends would host parties and would invite everyone in our class except me. And then they'd brag about how much fun they had in front of me. I had never felt so ostracized.\n\nJust recently, I get a Facebook message from this girl. She briefly apologized for 'being mean' and wanted to know when Id be back so we could catch up. I at first didn't respond, but after she sent me a few more messages asking me how ive been, I responded: \"Its nice that you've finally acknowledged you did me wrong, but apologizing years later doesn't fix anything. I do not want to be friends with you, so you should just leave me alone. Have a nice life!\"\n\nShe didnt respond, but also never contacted me again.\n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1674534708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jx5m3/aita_for_not_accepting_an_exfriends_apology/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have every right to cut her out of your life, and you don't owe an explanation to her or anyone else. Sounds like a prick - I'm sorry that happened to you.", "NTA. Sounds like she was sooo much worse than just \u201cbeing mean.\u201d She was intentionally abusive to you and encouraged others to abuse you. I\u2019m impressed you were so direct with her, good for you.", "NTA. You let her off easy. And you're under no obligation to accept an apology. If she was truly apologetic, then she'd need to recognize and own up to what she did exactly beyond \"being mean\". Like i tell my kids, it's not enough to say you're sorry, you need to admit to what you did and why it was wrong.", "NTA. Your life, you choose who gets to be in it, and when it comes to someone who used to bully you, I can understand why they would be excluded. I hope she did change but that potential change doesn't absolve her of the harm she caused or allow her a space back in your life.", "NTA - those of us abused in HS or Junior high who were contacted by those in our classes who might not have been the best to us have to really wonder - what the heck did they experience in those interactions?   \nDid they forget the bullying?\nDid they rewrite it in their tiny little evil minds?   \n  \nIDK.   \n\nI have to admit only the ones who were at least somewhat nice get to see anything I ever post and I question my mental health when I let them in. lol  \n\n\nI absolutely feel with the level of bullying you experienced that you made the right call.", "NTA. This could be an altruistic gesture. Perhaps something recently reminded her about that time, and she's feeling bad. She's made an effort, you refused, and now you are both off the hook. It's also possible that she hasn't changed at all and believes you have something she wants or wants you to do. Either way, you are better off where you left it.", "NTA - you don't owe her anything, even after her apology.", "NTA - you gave a healthy response and protected your boundaries. Bravo!", "NTA - good for you for putting up boundaries and cutting her out of your life.", "NTA - there's a reason why we say we offer an apology, because we can we refuse an offer.", "NTA! Her apology can\u2019t undo the damage and there\u2019s no telling if she\u2019s changed.", "NTA \n\nGrowing up doesn\u2019t mean that those experiences no longer affect you. She may have grown up, maybe changed and apologised to you, but that doesn\u2019t make you obligated to accept her apology and act like those experiences are forgotten.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s your choice who you associate with and whether you give that second chance or not. I think this was very healthy for you to do. You were honest and respected yourself.", "NTA that's a reasonable position to take and a reasonable way to articulate it.", "NTA. She royally wronged you and you deserve to keep that toxicity out of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was nice of her to apologize and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s realized how toxic she was, but you are not obligated to rekindle a friendship from middle school from a place you lived at for a year. I\u2019m sure she understands and probably didn\u2019t give it too much more thought beyond that, so I wouldn\u2019t invest much thought or emotional energy into it either. The past is the past. Kids can be caught up in weird toxic bandwagon moblike behavior and that\u2019s probably what happened, and as she matured she probably realized it and wants to atone for it, but you\u2019re response was sufficient and civil considering what she did.", "NTA but consider forgiving your ex-friend for your own sake. You don't have to be friends with them but holding onto past trauma doesn't help you.", "NTA.  It was your choice whether to forgive her or not.", "NTA whatsoever. You put evil in its place on the back burner on high where it belongs. GOOD FOR YOU.", "YTA. You don\u2019t need to be friends, but you\u2019re acting like a child and holding on to grudges from the way children behaved.\n\nIf I, God Almighty, acted like you, I\u2019d be flooding the planet again, we all act shitty as kids but we grow up.
