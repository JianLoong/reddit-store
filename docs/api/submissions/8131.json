I had to move in with my dad for a whole school year while my mom and ex stepdad were getting a divorce. I had a childhood friend there and we were pretty tight as kids. The summer before we hung out and everything was fine, but once school started she began excluding me from the friend group on purpose and getting her friends to gaslight me and contradict everything I said. One of her friends would poke me in the arm at lunch until it was red and stinging while she and the others sat there and said nothing, even though they could clearly see it. My friend would always tell me shed appreciate it if I just \"stopped following her around\" and called me 'annoying' all the time. She and her friends would host parties and would invite everyone in our class except me. And then they'd brag about how much fun they had in front of me. I had never felt so ostracized.\n\nJust recently, I get a Facebook message from this girl. She briefly apologized for 'being mean' and wanted to know when Id be back so we could catch up. I at first didn't respond, but after she sent me a few more messages asking me how ive been, I responded: \"Its nice that you've finally acknowledged you did me wrong, but apologizing years later doesn't fix anything. I do not want to be friends with you, so you should just leave me alone.

You have every right to cut her out of your life, and you don't owe an explanation to her or anyone else. Sounds like a prick - I'm sorry that happened to you.", "NTA. Sounds like she was sooo much worse than just \u201cbeing mean.\u201d She was intentionally abusive to you and encouraged others to abuse you. I\u2019m impressed you were so direct with her, good for you.", "NTA. You let her off easy. And you're under no obligation to accept an apology. If she was truly apologetic, then she'd need to recognize and own up to what she did exactly beyond \"being mean\". Like i tell my kids, it's not enough to say you're sorry, you need to admit to what you did and why it was wrong.", "NTA. Your life, you choose who gets to be in it, and when it comes to someone who used to bully you, I can understand why they would be excluded. I hope she did change but that potential change doesn't absolve her of the harm she caused or allow her a space back in your life.", "NTA - those of us abused in HS or Junior high who were contacted by those in our classes who might not have been the best to us have to really wonder - what the heck did they experience in those interactions?   \nDid they forget the bullying?\nDid they rewrite it in their tiny little evil minds?   \n  \nIDK.   \n\nI have to admit only the ones who were at least somewhat nice get to see anything I ever post and I question my mental health when I let them in. lol  \n\n\nI absolutely feel with the level of bullying you experienced that you made the right call.", "NTA. This could be an altruistic gesture. Perhaps something recently reminded her about that time, and she's feeling bad. She's made an effort, you refused, and now you are both off the hook. It's also possible that she hasn't changed at all and believes you have something she wants or wants you to do. Either way, you are better off where you left it.", "NTA - you don't owe her anything, even after her apology.", "NTA - you gave a healthy response and protected your boundaries. Bravo!", "NTA - good for you for putting up boundaries and cutting her out of your life.", "NTA - there's a reason why we say we offer an apology, because we can we refuse an offer.", "NTA! Her apology can\u2019t undo the damage and there\u2019s no telling if she\u2019s changed.", "NTA \n\nGrowing up doesn\u2019t mean that those experiences no longer affect you. She may have grown up, maybe changed and apologised to you, but that doesn\u2019t make you obligated to accept her apology and act like those experiences are forgotten.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s your choice who you associate with and whether you give that second chance or not. I think this was very healthy for you to do. You were honest and respected yourself.", "NTA that's a reasonable position to take and a reasonable way to articulate it.", "NTA. She royally wronged you and you deserve to keep that toxicity out of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was nice of her to apologize and I\u2019m glad she\u2019s realized how toxic she was, but you are not obligated to rekindle a friendship from middle school from a place you lived at for a year. I\u2019m sure she understands and probably didn\u2019t give it too much more thought beyond that, so I wouldn\u2019t invest much thought or emotional energy into it either. The past is the past. Kids can be caught up in weird toxic bandwagon moblike behavior and that\u2019s probably what happened, and as she matured she probably realized it and wants to atone for it, but you\u2019re response was sufficient and civil considering what she did.", "NTA but consider forgiving your ex-friend for your own sake. You don't have to be friends with them but holding onto past trauma doesn't help you.", "NTA.  It was your choice whether to forgive her or not.", "NTA whatsoever. You put evil in its place on the back burner on high where it belongs. GOOD FOR YOU.", "[removed]", "some things you cant walk back", "NTA. Your response was fine and clearly worked. Well done.", "Maybe I'm jaded and spend too much time on r/antiMLM, but this smacks a little bit of a pyramid scam pitch. It feels like if she'd managed to keep the conversation going a touch longer, she was planning to drop an emoji-laden copypasted sales pitch for her clumpy spider leg mascaras or her dildo parties.\n\nNTA regardless, though.", "i've had people that treated me like shit apologize half assedly many years later just like she did with you, OP, so i get it.. you are NTA for reacting the way you did. don't need that toxicity in your life.", "The op act like a normal person here. Apology is not an order and doesn't have to be accepted. Furthermore, you are exceptionally cruel and evil. I'll just let the mod handle this.", "Nta. I had something similar happen to me. When the dude messaged me to apologize, I went through the trouble of planning for us to hangout. I blocked him and didn't show up.", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nI had a similar situation growing up. She apologized when we were in middle school and like an idiot I forgave her and continued to be \u201cfriends\u201d. It screwed with my self confidence for years. Fortunately I switched high schools before my sophomore year and discovered what real friendship was. \n\nGood for you not giving her a pass. I am sure your life has only improved since you got away from that toxicity. \n\nDose of Karma: the girl got heavy into drugs and ended up running away from home. She graduated 6 months pregnant.", "I had the same thought", "know exactly how you feel. been in the same situation multiple different times and it is not a good feeling. so i understand not wanting to forgive your ex-friend, after all that she did and didn't do and i know how it can really effect someone. but even when they do end up apologising, you remember what they did and what they've put you through. while it might have come off as mean to her, it was well deserved. final thought? NTA.", "NTA at all. Chances are those friends cut her out and now she doesn't have anyone to hang out with so she was reaching out trying to get a friend back. You did things exactly right.", "NTA. Your life your choice to accept or refuse her apology. Move on don't waste time thinking AITA.", "NTA\n\nI was also bullied. I've had a few bullies or, worse, those who stood by and watched try the old 'one line apology' thing. I just smile politely and say 'I do not forgive you' (meanwhile my brain is mentally going all [Edward Woodward](https://youtu.be/AhIz6wpFPrA?t=28) on them.)", "NTA When people do this I always ask myself, \"What are they wanting out of this interaction, and do I gain anything from it?\" They want closure, they want a friend back who treated them better than they deserved, they realize they overreacted, they understand what a jerk they were and are hoping to fix it all, want me to join their MLM....\n\nThe answer to the second question is almost always...nothing.  I mean it's nice to know they feel bad about it I guess?  For my own peace of mind I like to try to forgive (not excuse) people.  Which often just means finding a way to let go of the bad feelings, wish them well far far away from me, and hope they're better people.  But rekindling thos friendships brings me absolutely no benefits because...I don't want them as a friend.  I'll never trust them again, and  I'm doing just fine.\n\nI've had ex boyfriends, ex roommates, ex friends all reach out wanting some kind of... something.  But no, I don't want to start a long distance book club with you, run a 5k, rehash your toxic behavior so you can feel like people like you again. Just because I'm not letting those negative feelings fester, doesn't mean I'm missing you in my life.", "NTA.  probably she has kids now and is fishing around for free babysitting", "NTA\n\nYou don't _have_ to accept an apology, especially one that you feel isn't sincere or reflects appropriately on how you were made to feel.\n\nGoes without saying that friends don't let friends bear the brunt of jokes and be turned into a laughing stock or be bullied just to fit in or be popular themselves - which is what it seems is what happened.\n\nYou're perfectly in your rights and entitled to say what you did and not be in touch ever again.", " It was a pretty weak apology for what she put you through. Bravo for telling her what's up. \n\nNTA", "NTA A late apology means nothing. Makes me wonder what she wants since I really dont feel like she has any real guilty feeling.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.  It's called consequences.", "NTA. This person treated you horribly and encouraged others to do the same.\n\nWho knows why they've reached out years later, but you have no obligation to accept their apology. You responded in a very mature manner, personally I would have just blocked them and gotten on with life but if anything I think your way was better than that.", "NTA.  You handled that great.  You don't need people like that in your life.", ">She didnt respond, but also never contacted me again.\n\nWhy does this surprise you. She is respecting your response. NTA but it seems like what you said and what you wanted contradict.", "NTA. She is gaslighting you now. NC is the way.", "Nope. You don't need toxic people in your life.", "> she was planning to drop an emoji-laden copypasted sales pitch for her clumpy spider leg mascaras or her dildo parties.\n\nThank you for the much needed laugh! That was the best thing I\u2019ve read today!", "True, but some people really are sorry about the bad things they've done.  I do feel like this person was working up to asking for something.", "NTA you are never obligated to forgive a bully, and if you do, it's for you, not for her.  It's good she at least took that small step, but you don't her anything, and she needs to accept that.", "NTA sounds like she is apologising to make herself feel better not you i wouldve throw some extremely hurtful profanity in there or just block her immediate but you handle that very maturely", "Nope NTA at all. She wants to feel let off the hook for her behavior and you don\u2019t owe her that. I\u2019ve got a friendship that went bad, not this bad, but the girl will still send me requests on social media. I delete it and move on. We don\u2019t owe them explanations, communication, or anything else!", "NTA\n\nJust because she apologised doesn't mean you have to accept it.\n\nYou have moved in your life, and dont need the toxicity of looking back.\n\n**She didnt respond, but also never contacted me again.**\n\nThat said it seems to me that you may want her to try harder or maybe so you can carry on throwing it back in her face.\n\nI can understand both emotions, bu I would try and wash your hands of both. These things always come back to haunt/hurt you in the end.\n\nJust focus on yourself and making yourself happy", "NTA contrary to what some may think apologizing really doesn\u2019t mean as much as some seem to think it does. Keep your peace of mind and keep this kind of bs as far away from you as you can. And needless to say no you are not being petty,you have moved on with your life and stepping back to people and things from your past isn\u2019t always conductive to making your future as drama free as it could be.", "NTA. What a random timing to apologize! I wonder why now? \n\nAnyway, you have no obligation to accept her apologies. And she left you alone after that, that's a good thing!", "NTA.  You owe her nothing after how she behaved and treated you.  Hopefully, she's grown up and maybe learned from her past actions, but that doesn't mean she gets to use the youth card to get forgiveness.", "    She didnt respond, but also never contacted me again.\n\nUmm, ok.  Mission accomplished!  It's great that you're willing to consider her feelings after all these years (and how you were treated).  But, honestly, you were civil in your response, and I wouldn't waste any more time or brain space thinking about this.  To use your words...have a nice life :)  NTA", "She contacted you with an agenda.  Your response let her know two things:  you aren\u2019t over it, you no longer want or need her friendship.  She may have assumed you are today as you were then?\n\nYou handled that beautifully.  Short and to the point.", "NTA - This is a karma slam dunk OP. Do not allow yourself to feel guilty about how you handled it, you did everything right. You should walk away with pride for successfully asserting your boundaries."]}
