I also have two mother in laws, the bio mom of my husband (Macy) and the step mom (Sara). But after the passing of my mom, both MILs had different reactions. \n\nMacy never liked my mom, and was quick to try and replace her, saying things like \u201cnow I\u2019m your only motherly figure\u201d or referring to herself as \u201cmommy\u201d. I\u2019ve never called Macy mom nor mommy, and I\u2019ve only called her by her name.  This felt very off putting to me, and i had to ask her over a dozen times to please not say things like that, or to not address herself as my mom. Before this, our relationship was very soso. We didn\u2019t have a problem with each other,  but we weren\u2019t extremely close either. But our relationship quickly deteriorated after my moms passing\n\nSara was super supportive to me throughout the grieving process. She didn\u2019t know my mom super well, but she wasn\u2019t pushing to be a replacement.

Our relationship grew a lot after that. We are pretty close now.\n\nNow onto the actual story. It came time to plan the baby shower. So I picked some of the most important women in my life (that live in the area and are willing to help/ host the shower). I chose my aunt, my moms best friend, who is like my second mom, and Sara. We all went out to a cafe and got the plans made for the shower. Well, the invites arrived today, so me and my husband hand delivered one to Macy, And she FLIPPED out.

Furthermore, since she can't respect your wishes to not make inappropriate comments and references to herself in light of your mother's death, you don't owe her anything at all in terms of letting her plan the baby shower. Honestly, she should be happy you're even inviting her because I don't know if I would.\n\nAlso, I'm really glad your husband is supportive of you and thinks you made the right decision. You deserve to be around people who support and uplift you when you need it, not people who like to bolster themselves at the cost of disrespecting a recently deceased family member. \n\nI hope things get better between you and her eventually, but you're definitely NTA.", "NTA, what a horrible entitled woman. How's the pregnancy? When are you due? We're starting a family too", "NTA. Sara sounds like a wonderful woman, plus you trust and respect her. It's totally reasonable to me that you have a better relationship to Sara over Macy. Macy has been overbearing. Worst of all, Macy doesn't and won't respect your boundaries after being told many times. Good luck and wishing you all the best!", "NTA. Your baby shower, your rules. And her reaction justified what you did.", "NTA. Baby showers are a gift to you. She\u2019s more than welcome to throw you an additional party. I must have had 6 bridal showers. This is about you. Not her.", "NTA. Tell MIL and the people siding with her that their reaction is exactly why you are distancing yourself from her. All of this is your business, not theirs. How you deal with your mother passing, your relationships with other people, and your baby shower are all yours to define.\n\nRelationships are mutually consensual, but MIL is forcing her way into your life, and trying to replace your mother. That\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s offensive; there\u2019s even a certain violence to it.", "Fake Grandma?  \nYeah, the one with the real tears, as opposed to the \"real\" grandma\" with the fake ones.\n\nNTA", "Nta, but what caused her to flip out? Did y'all tell her that step mil helped plan?", "nta, mil super out of line. you're doing great and congrats!", "NTA\n\nMacy has some serious control issues and things aren't panning out like she wants them too.\n\nWhat's your partners take on his mother?  She sounds very controlling and you may have some difficult behaviour to put up with as you move further in your pregnancy and after the baby is born.\n\nYou're going to have to set some boundaries and stick them.  If she's not careful she's not going to have a relationship with her grandchild.  And she is not owed a relationship with any of your children regardless of the fact she birthed their father.\n\nYour next issue is going to be her wanting to be there when the child is born.. and then wanting to stay with you to 'help' when you come home.   \n\nLook up narcissism and see if her behaviour matches.  Keep her on an information diet as the less she knows the less she has to get upset about.", "NTA\n\nThis was purely you and husband's choice. His baby, too, right? \n\nBut do recognize she's probably embarrassed because it may be evident to others now that she's at arm's length. And naturally her family feels loyal to her. Make sure everyone knows this was a joint decision. Husband cannot get away with being privately supportive while letting you take all the hit publicly.\n\nAlso, it would have been thoughtful of your husband to tell his mom privately, before you both \"presented\" her with the invitation. You had to know she might feel left out. He could have handled the initial reaction privately, sparing you some of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What a horrible way to speak about someone! Listen to the words she's saying right now OP, she's going to use those hurtful words with your children too. Start putting up those boundaries now to protect your future children OP.", "NTA. You are due in Sept 3 - in three months. If Macy wanted to plan your shower, she should have been planning you a shower. It sounds like she had zero intentions to throw you a shower, but is now trying to save face because Sara is involved. Either that or she is the worst planner in the world who seriously thought she still had time to plan and throw a shower this late in your pregnancy.\n\nETA: My condolences on the loss of your mother. I\u2019m glad you have an ally and a real grandma in Sara.", "NTA", "We are due sep 3rd and it feels like it\u2019s almost coming too fast! I had a lot of issues with bleeding during the first trimester, but thankfully it went away and baby is doing good! When are you due?", "At first it was the fact that it was planned in general without her, but then she pointed out that the shower is being held at Saras house. Which she knows The address of.", "DM me?", "A reaction like that makes me think she has jealousy/insecurities due to Sara. Does she hate Sarah? If so, is it a valid reason? If not, I would distance myself because she will eventually turn on you as well. If it\u2019s a valid reason, depending on the reason, I would try to find middle ground and include her sometimes as well. But it\u2019s completely up to you.", "From what I\u2019ve gathered, she isn\u2019t a huge fan of Sara because she had a successful marriage with macys ex husband through the 17 years they have been married. Macy and ex husband were only married for a year and a half when he decided he wasn\u2019t in love", "Or perhaps Macy's behaviour is the reason the marriage lasted only 18 months.\n\nDid Macy marry again?  Or has she been able to have a healthy long term relationship since?  Does she have any other kids other than your partner?", "NTA\n\nIt is your shower, not hers. It is yours to plan with those with whom you feel closest to.   \n\n\nShe wants to dictate the terms of your relationship. She wants to be liked. When neither one is not becoming a reality, she is lashing out and blaming you.", "NTA, you can choose whoever you prefer as the host, just because she's the blood relative to your husband  doesn't make her entitled to the baby shower", "i\u2019m not even gonna read it bc i don\u2019t need to. but it\u2019s your baby shower. not hers. you get to choose who is involved and who\u2019s not. it\u2019s your day. your baby. you\u2019re carrying, you get to choose. it\u2019s your day.", "Absolutely NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with backlash from Macy, especially after those disgusting comments about being your only mom now. Like who in their right mind says something like that to someone who has just lost their mother? \nI lost my own mother a few years ago very suddenly as well, and would have absolutely raged out on anyone who said something like that to me, so I commend you for keeping your cool in this situation, I do not think I would have been able to. \nI definitely agree with some other commenters that it would have been nice of your husband to have informed Macy himself, sparing you the brunt of the backlash, but hindsight is 20/20 and all that. Even though she\u2019s been weird, it doesn\u2019t sound like you guys expected her to fly off the handle about this. \n\nTo the main point though, again, NTA. This is your and your husbands child. You two get to decide who gets to help you and with what. No one else is entitled to any kind of involvement with either you or your child. The fact that her family is backing her on this is baffling to me, I don\u2019t understand how they can\u2019t see she\u2019s being unreasonable. It\u2019s also not like she can\u2019t throw another shower if she wanted to do it so badly. And to reiterate another comment I read, you\u2019re only 3 mos out from due date, and she has yet to being planning anything? It doesn\u2019t sound like she had actually planned on throwing you a shower herself, but is instead throwing a temper tantrum over not getting to be in the spotlight. \n\nHopefully she gets over herself, but if not just continue to move forward with your head held high, and continue to only allow people who truly have your and your family\u2019s best interests at heart in your inner circle. \nI wish you and your baby nothing but luck and health on your upcoming delivery. Congratulations \ud83d\udda4", "NTA. It's your baby shower, pregnancy, and baby; you should be able to make your own decisions. It's not your responsibility to internalise any emotions your MIL might be feeling over not being allowed to micromanage you over this. She can just get over it anyway, there's a lot more to come on this journey that you've started on.", "Exactly this!!! Very very well said. Another person thinks they\u2019re entitled!! Congratulations on the pregnancy and I truly wish you happy and healthy baby", "in dont understand the downvotes not everyone wants to talk about their baby stuff so openly on the internet.\n\nBut the due date you could habe shared. ;) its not like it is some serious information.", "I chew gum for 8 hours", "[removed]", "NTA, but the plural form of mother in law is mothers in law.", "NTA you can ask anyone you want for help and are not required to include anyone. Your life, your baby, your choice.", "NTA, and you probably need to take a long hard look at how she's with her grandbaby to decide if she has a place in their life. She has some signs of a granny who'll use the baby to get to you, it happens all too often and is very traumatic for children.", "Nta macy sounds like an entitled shit-bag-on-the-move and sarah is a caring step mil who comforts those in need, the reason you did not let her help plan was because she was quick to replace your mother after her death and didn\u2019t give you a chance to think of it before she just addressed herself as your mom which is, well idiotic would be an understatement", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSorry for my question, but what exactly is a baby shower?
