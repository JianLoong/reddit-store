I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with backlash from Macy, especially after those disgusting comments about being your only mom now.

Even though she\u2019s been weird, it doesn\u2019t sound like you guys expected her to fly off the handle about this. \n\nTo the main point though, again, NTA. This is your and your husbands child. You two get to decide who gets to help you and with what. No one else is entitled to any kind of involvement with either you or your child. The fact that her family is backing her on this is baffling to me, I don\u2019t understand how they can\u2019t see she\u2019s being unreasonable. It\u2019s also not like she can\u2019t throw another shower if she wanted to do it so badly. And to reiterate another comment I read, you\u2019re only 3 mos out from due date, and she has yet to being planning anything? It doesn\u2019t sound like she had actually planned on throwing you a shower herself, but is instead throwing a temper tantrum over not getting to be in the spotlight. \n\nHopefully she gets over herself, but if not just continue to move forward with your head held high, and continue to only allow people who truly have your and your family\u2019s best interests at heart in your inner circle. \nI wish you and your baby nothing but luck and health on your upcoming delivery.

My father passed away unexpectedly recently, and my sisters and I often talk about all the \u201cgrief vultures\u201d or \u201cgrief goblins\u201d that show their true selves and make this horrible experience all about them. It\u2019s beyond inappropriate. It\u2019s disrespectful and so hurtful. Your MIL is one for sure.  Trying to spin this tragedy into her benefit? Replacing your mom? Is she serious?  If anyone stepped in and tried to act like they were my new dad after what happened, I\u2019d be distancing myself at the very least, and possibly going no contact. It\u2019s such an insensitive, emotionally immature reaction. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that. You don\u2019t owe her anything, and you\u2019re entitled to have better relationships with people who treat you respectfully. She\u2019s lucky she was invited.", "NTA. \u201cFake grandma\u201d?? Sounds like Macy has a lot of Sara issues and is trying to insert herself as top dog. You keep doing what you\u2019re doing. My (former) MIL pulled that crap right after my mother died as well and is STILL mad I asked then told her to knock it off.", "NTA do not doubt yourself. It is easy to see what the grandparenting will be like from these two MILs, you just got a sneak preview. Congratulations on the baby!", "NTA she sounds like she is high on the narcissism scale and it may be wise to maintain and hold very strong boundaries from here on out. You asked her time and again to not make derogatory comments about your mom, nor to insert herself as YOUR mom. She didn't listen. This is her fault. If you aren't already, get on the same page as your husband and ask him to deal with any and all communication with his mother from here on out. Tell him that this is no longer negotiable.  Treat her with basic respect, but I would personally maintain a good distance from here on out, especially with a baby on the way.  If you both don't, I promise she will become a whole new level of PITA when she decides she is entitled to be the only \"grandma\" in your child's life.", "Um...\n\nThe hell? NTA! You can invite/not invite or recruit/not recruit who you want. This event is about YOU, YOUR HUSBAND, AND YOUR BABY! Not your mother-in-law. Her \"mommy\" behavior and the lack of boundaries that followed after you repeatedly asked her not to do it aside, she's not entitled to a role in planning anything. It's not up to her.   \n\n\nYou can ask and not ask whoever you choose. It's YOUR time, your life event. And based on her behavior you've mentioned,  it may be necessary to uninvite her or remove her at the time of the event, if she refuses to be respectful and accepting of the circumstances. So, just be prepared haha. Congrats, by the way!!!", "NTA- it sounds like your bio MIL sounds a little like mine, wants to be involved in all the things and to make herself the center of all things. Shocked her own family hasn\u2019t seen it yet, they will eventually. I wish you well for the remainder of your pregnancy. \n\nI will give a little piece of advice since she is not respecting your wishes around referring her as \u2018your new mom or mother figure\u2019. SET BOUNDARIES  with the baby, since you know she will be trashing step grandma to the child. It\u2019s hard but it seems you have an awesome supportive husband.", "No absolutely not. This is YOUR baby. YOUR baby shower. Fuck what everyone else wants. Are they going to be in the hospital bed pushing a watermelon through their pinhole? NO. That\u2019s all you. This is all about YOU and what YOU say goes. YOU are pregnant. YOU are going through it. And anyone who does not understand can\u2019t fuck right off a cliff. Edit: I\u2019ve had 4 kids. Been there done that, now I have the T-shirt lol.", "nta", "NTA.  OP, I ask you to consider something important: you and your husband need to think about what boundaries you will set with Macy and the baby. I do think that you should consider all the sides; her position as husband\u2019s mom, if you want her to know her grandchild, was Macy acting out of jealousy or some primal hurt because Sara succeeded in a relationship where she had not, all that. Once you both have thought about the relationship and established boundaries, do Macy a kindness and let her know the boundaries firmly but politely. Be in a private place, and don\u2019t feel the need to stay if she becomes abusive or in any way inappropriate. \n\nThe woman is obviously in pain and desperately wants to be a mother figure. Sadly, she is TOTALLY wrong in how she goes about achieving her goal and she hurt you terribly. Establish those expectations *soon,* so Macy doesn\u2019t have more chances to try for Motherhood 2.0!", "NAT but I'm afraid this is just the beginning.

Ms Macy seems like she needs to step off her soap box and ease off the main character syndrome. She doesn\u2019t seem to respect you as it is, why would she think you\u2019d want her input on the baby shower other than her seemingly thinking it\u2019s her right?

I hope it gets sorted with an outcome you\u2019re happy with.", "No offense but if MIL can't properly behave you and your husband need to put distance and go LC or NC with her until she calm down, because she's making a hostile environment for you (the new mom) and surely for the baby. \n\n\nWhat has been doing your partner? Stop her? Told her she's out of line? Limiting contact? Talking to her and make her understand she has been unappropriated since your mom passed? That's a husband problem OP, not a MIL problem, and is something you need to resolve a while ago. You both are too young to constantly live around a hostile toxic MIL, you're too young to stay where you don't feel comfortable with a toxic MIL disrespecting your boundaries.\nPlease before the baby born be sure you have a strong support system (outside your partner) and some emergency savings, don't be afraid to ask for help. And if the situation is too ugly RUN. Get out of there.", "Why does Ms.Macy give me \u201cEntitled MIL\u201d wants to always be included in things where no one asked for her opinion or input.Her son is GROWN and MARRIED to YOU so therefore she feels as if you\u2019re a threat,so she tries to attach herself to YOU due to the fact that she doesn\u2019t want to lose her son BUT not only will she lose him she loses you and the baby in the process as well.And the audacity of her trying to \u201creplace\u201d your mother !!!!!!! I like Sara and I don\u2019t even know her !!! You did the right thing by not including Macy because everything was going to be about HER and what looked good for HER.You can tell ALOT about a person just off energy alone..be pregnant and happy don\u2019t worry about petty mess \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "Nta!", "NTA!  Your husband\u2019s mom sounds like a real piece of work!  I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to include her in your happy plans.  And kudos to the step MIL for the way she supported you through your mom\u2019s death.  Sorry for such sadness at your young age.  Anyway, you are not required to include the PIA MIL, but you might want to consider being a wee bit more diplomatic as you are now stuck with this woman for the rest of her life, and she is going to be grandma to your baby.

Much like weddings, birthdays, holiday parties, etc., baby showers and those who are involved in them is entirely up to the most important person at the party: you.\n\nMIL has unresolved issues from her marriage and divorce from FIL, the most glaring of which is feeling replaced by \"the other woman\".  Let me shout this for you and all the other young women out there faced with one of these people:  HER ISSUES ARE NOT AND SHOULD NEVER BE YOUR ISSUES.\n\nHow to respond, though?  If it were me, my response would be a flat, \"I've made my choice.  You're welcome to attend as a guest or not at all, but should you come, I expect you to treat the other guests with the same amount of respect you feel you are entitled to.\"\n\nThe rest of Macy's family can go suck an egg.

I'm disappointed to hear that your MIL used it as an opportunity to try and cheapen your mother's memory by making her seem replaceable.", "NTA", "Good luck! NTA Macy is a huge Ahole", "NTA. But you are 20. Is this the relationship you want with Macy in 20 years? She is a mom here, too, even though she is acting like an ass right now. My point is, nothing should be settled here, about who you like more or who is nicer. Things change a lot over the years, and this woman who was so callous about your mom (geez that's terrible), may be there for you in ways you couldn't have imagined in 5 years. And Sara will disappoint you, because we all disappoint each other. \n\nYour baby will have a lot of people to love them, and family that will always be there.

You aren't going to get your way when you act out and and remind them exactly why they didn't involve you in the first place. \nIf you want to keep her somewhat happy, Tell her if she would like to throw you a small get together of her friends and family, that would be great. But you prefer to keep it small, like an intimate tea party.", "NTA times 1000! \n\nMacy disrespected and violated boundaries with regards to her trying to push to be your mommy.

Like wtf, and she is definitely an AH for actively ignoring what you\u2019ve asked of her. I get that she wants to be involved in your life but there are better, healthier ways to go about that than what she did, like there is absolutely zero concern for what you were feeling and it\u2019s gross. \nAt least Sara was there to be the support you needed through your grieving process and allowed you the environment you needed to heal. \n\nYou had every right not to include Macy for disrespecting your wishes. This is your baby shower and you get to decide who is involved in it. \nMacy seems to only be focused on her role in your life and what she wants from you, not what you need.

You did nothing wrong and should hold your ground. The comment of \u201cnow I am your only mom figure\u201d would\u2019ve sent me through the roof. I think this is a normal tactic when in-laws are trying to persuade a couple to have bias towards them therefore taking precedence over the other in laws. Mine do the same with the \u201cI\u2019m your parent too now\u201d stuff. Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing and hold the line. Create boundaries and consequences.

I certainly wouldn't want to put her in a planning position or some other role where she's given control, since she's unable to listen to you when it comes to things as serious as not wanting to address her as mommy.\n\nAnd calling someone \"fake grandma?\" Jeez. \n\nShe's invited, not an outsider.

Set her straight with boundaries now because you can bet this will be the first of many many things she will try to commandeer.

Because she wanted the recognition of my graduation for herself, she never once called me or texted me to tell me congratulations. \n\nThese milestone celebrations whatever they maybe are to celebrate you and your family. You have the right to involve and/or invite whenever you wish. If your MIL continues to act in this manner I would tell her that her invitation is revoked.

I wouldn\u2019t blame you or your husband if you started to decrease contact or go no contact.", "NTA. Sounds like it's time to go low to NC with Macy and her side of the family.

My sister is helping me with the baby shower she\u2019s been my support since she was adopted truly my best friend.

I left it alone hoping she would grieve her own pain and want to be part of our lives. Fast forward to 7 months and she\u2019s throwing a fit because we won\u2019t have the shower the weekend she wants and don\u2019t need anymore help as we have already planned things.
