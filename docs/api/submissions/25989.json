However, saying that your own grandfather who has had no relationship to him prior suddenly \u201cowes him\u201d is a very entitled and just wrong way to go about asking for some live and attention. I do feel bad that he had so suffer, and saw that the only one around him that could maybe make him as happy as you would be your grandfather, so he craved that, but trying to force it and acting in such a way isn\u2019t the way to go about it. Unfortunately considering the general idea of his parents, I\u2019m sure he never really had a proper parental figure to teach him how to handle his emotions. \n\nBut still, no excuse, especially *years later* to be complaining about what you decide to name your child.

That fucks with you. \n\nIt was similar with my brother but he was always friendly and he confused me a lot. He had children and eventually he (mostly via his wife) ended up reaching out.

It was a little crappy of the grandfather to just refuse to let the poor kid hang out with them, but it\u2019s also not his responsibility anyways, and I\u2019m sure the grandfather enjoyed quality time alone with his biological grandson.

His loneliness caused him to make rash decisions and choose some bad words. No one taught him how to understand his jealousy or how to not act entitled due to it, even at 15 if he grew up such a way of course there\u2019s going to be mistakes and issues. I want to be understanding of OP and his grandfather, because it\u2019s true that they didn\u2019t have any responsibility over him, but it would have been nice if they could provide him with at least some care or support, even though they don\u2019t have to. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the half brother is still in this entitled stage of thinking, and he\u2019s in the wrong for trying to make this situation of baby naming all about him and his feelings, and not let OP just have good memories of his grandfather.

He was not owed anything however he might have wished for a stable adult in his life.\n\nYou and your husband gave your son a name to honour someone very close to you.", "Measuring every little bit of kindness or aid you offer other people by whether or not they are genetic extensions of yourself seems kind of assholey to me, honestly.", "Exactly.  Why isn't anyone dumping on mom's family for abandoning both kids?", "Lol, you must be the half brother. Mom's side abandoned both kids in a terrible situation, but y'all are blaming a non related adult.", "I mean, step brother was a young kid being rejected by everyone who was supposed to care for him. Yes he was 15 but he had been raised in a terrible home and likely had no one to help guide him through his emotions, and frankly even adults struggle with that shit. I don\u2019t think it was on him to better articulate his feelings, it\u2019s on the adults to recognize the situation for what it is. While I don\u2019t think the grandfather is TA for not wanting responsibility for another kid he shouldn\u2019t have to be a father to, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on the kid to better navigate his emotions that adults even struggle to navigate and articulate.", "Something not being wrong doesn\u2019t exactly make it right, either. I feel for half-brother.", "OP asked if he's the asshole for dismissing his brother's feelings, not for naming his son in this way.", "Good for you", "Only if the half brother has ovaries.\n\nAs someone who has half-siblings, though I never think of them as half anything, I can't imagine being this cruel to any of them. \n\nWe all share the same mother but have different fathers (just two fathers, mine and theirs). They've always called my bio father \"uncle\" and my paternal grandparents \"gran and gramps.\" They were as loved by my paternal family as I was.

Empathy is a hell of a thing, you don't actually need to believe the person is an angel who is justified in their actions to be empathetic to how they got there. OP's half-brother had a terrible, shitty childhood, and tried to attach himself to love and stability where he saw it. None of us should turn our noses up at that. Now he's a broken adult and he needs therapy and he has trouble expressing his emotions. I don't necessarily agree with him that it's a slap in the face to him, I think it's totally great that OP named his son after his grandpa, but just understand that it is hard for the half-brother due to his shitty childhood. Have some empathy.", "There\u2019s something very weird and off about posting an opinion on a public discussion forum and being a freak about responses lmao", "It\u2019s not \u201cidealism\u201d, it\u2019s humanity. Grandfather has raised children, he understands how vulnerable they are. He\u2019s makes himself he\u2019s a refuge from his grandson\u2019s volatile home life but he won\u2019t extend that compassion to the little brother he knows is also suffering? He sees a small child in this chaos and doesn\u2019t even ask about him?\n\nAnd probably controversial on this sub but I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to have love for someone so connected to the people you already care so much about.", "You're funny, I'll give you that.", "Living in a volatile household with a little brother a decade younger than you and refusing him the only refuge you have does. And doing zero reflection on that as an adult with your own child, stability and the ability to reflect on this with some clarity most definitely does.", "Yeah, that's how hurt, emotionally vulnerable teenagers often operate.", "And that why they struggle to get help. \n\nDoesn't change the fact he demanded from someone who owed him nothing, and left with nothing.", ">My half brother said grandpa owed him. Grandpa told him he was not his grandson and he did not owe him anything and told him to go back home.

Hopefully your step brother can find some real family, with people that do want to be around him and dont treat him like shit.", "NTA \nHowever your grandpa is.

Christmas time and children I had never seen before were brought as a family member was dating someone with children.  Each child has presents under the tree and they were treated like family.\n\nThey didn't have to do it.  They were well within their rights to not interact with children not related to them, but I will always love them because they responded out of love.  \nthey went to church on Sunday then lived the principles every day.\n\nYour grandfather did not have to do anything for your half brother.  But he could have.  He could have had a great impact on a child's life, but he choose not to.  \n\nIt is fine to name your son whatever makes you happy, but please understand your brother and show compassion.

So then what\u2026. Idk some people have to learn. It\u2019s not like everyone went through life easy", "Being told no isn\u2019t hard and it isn\u2019t cruel. there are people who are raised with audacity and ask the most outrageous things out of people because they never learned no. People need to learn shame, rejection, and embarrassment in order to learn boundaries and socialization. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I asked my neighbors to take my to Disneyland Bc they were going themselves. Was it audacious: yes. Did they say no: yes. Did I learn what not to ask: yes.", "If the kid already had these sky high expectations they just would have gotten bigger if the grandfather entertained them, though. We also don't know why the relationship with his son and OP's mom was 'on and off again', maybe that's a factor.", "Notice how there\u2019s a buffer between the half brother and grandpa. The buffer is literally OP. There\u2019s literally no direct connection between half brother and grandpa", "People build relationships through choice and blood relations. Is the half brother blood related: no. Did grandpa choose to take care of him: no. Therefore, grandpa doesn\u2019t need to do anything with him", "You are completely missing the point, the grandfather was a dick to a child begging for attention with crap parents and could have been empathized with the child. This is solely about OP who witnessed everything first hand and lacks an ounce of empathy just like their grandfather", "If my daughter wanted to sleep over at your house, eat your food, go on trips with your family, sleep at your house and you say no, does that make you cruel? If you want to take care of my kid, I can provide you a Venmo", "It *is* perfectly reasonable to turn away a completely random kid that has no relation to you whatshowever. At most he could have called cps, but he has no obligation to do that either.", "No, it's still right.  Not kind, maybe.\n\nI feel bad for the kid, too, to be honest.", "Agreed. Gramps didn\u2019t have a 15 yr old suddenly thrust upon him. He had a kid begging for a way out for years. Op knew how damnably unhealthy the house was and just left him there and told him he didn\u2019t care that he was suffering alone. \n\nThat says a lot about a person", "The truth is, most people don't give a single, solitary damn about anyone outside of their friends and blood family, so sadly I don't think that your statement that it's humanity is accurate at all. \n\nThe grandfather probably never expected to be in the scenario where he'd be playing father to his grandson, right? And that we don't know what happened between his son and OP's mom and how that might affect things? You'll notice that OP says that her own family got tired of her actions. \n\nThe grandfather getting involved could have opened a can of worms with the mother, the mother's family and the dad and his family, too. I don't blame him at all for staying out of it. It's sad for the kid but it's not grandpa's fault or responsibility.", "OP did not refuse his brother his grandfather as a refuge. The grandfather refused him, because it wasn't his grandson. OP had no control over it. You want him to feel guilty over an adult's decisions made when he was a child?", "A valid viewpoint, I suppose. I disagree that the brother didn't do anything wrong - you don't get to demand relationships from people because you share a person in common.", "He gets a free pass I believe because he was a child at the time.  A child who'd seen his sister receive love and attention and who'd asked to tag along for a long time before that final rejection.   Can't really say a child was wrong to want that.  \n\nI imagine the grandfather,  being older and wiser,  and how he could've rejected the boy so casually for so long.   OK he wasn't his blood grandchild but the kid looked up to him.  The grandfather will have known the difference he could've chosen to make in a young boys life.\n\nAnd OP isn't responsible for all those times of rejection.  It's just that now she's an adult herself and with a young lad.  Yet she still can't see or regret the pain caused by her own actions. \n\nI just feel so sad for the child that brother was and the anger and pain that'll be hurting his likelihood for happiness as an adult.", "Indeed.", "I see this very tragic Hallwark channel story you've got playing in your head, but it doesn't match the reality presented.\n\nHe was fifteen and OP (who is a brother, not a sister) hadn't lived there for seven years - so he hadn't seen OP receive love or ask to tag along for close to a decade, just shy of half his life. As far as the grandfather, who is dead and whose actions do not fall on OP at all, if you expect people to live up to your imagination, you're going to be very disappointed very often.\n\nWhy should OP regret things he had no control over?", "I try to be reasonable. Not always successful lol. But I do try and I appreciate it from others, so thank you, as well. :)", "It is tragic!  Like... I'm painting the house and I wait for the ant trail to pass before I paint around them. LOL.  True!\n\nI think it's clear that OPs brother had a tough childhood.  It shouldn't be a step too far then for OP to at least empathise with that. \n\nI can hear someone's difficult story and genuinely be able to say I'm sorry they've been through a rough time.  I'm able to offer appropriate help to a stranger in need.  So while this story resides in my imagination,  it's more often I'm disappointed in others that don't share my ethics of not walking past a person in need. \n\nThat's my problem. And I can hear you thinking already that I can't put my morals on others.   But I'd rather have high moral expectations of myself and others and make my corner of the world a better place if I can. So I'll keep trying.  \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA but I feel bad for your half brother because he really needed stability in his life and to him, that was your grandfather.

Your half brother needs therapy ASAP.\n\nIt seems your grandfather did not exercise empathy when you both were growing up. If it were me, I would let him join occasionally.

Your bro needs intensive therapy.", "From an emotional point of view, I think he is. He's been let down by pretty much everyone in his family, blood or otherwise, and comes across as emotionally stunted and needy, but only because he is desperate to have someone to relate to.

Is he personally responsible for financially providing for the child? No. But is it callous to shew away a child in desperation? Yes. It would have cost very little to provide emotional support, allow him to stay there, contact a school, or any other number of things an adult can do to connect neglected/abused children to resources. Turning him away the way he did definitely communicated, \"this child isn't your brother,\" to OP. OP's brother deserves a more supportive community than those he has.", "Yeah, I don't get why everyone is giving the half brother the \"if you give a mouse a cookie\" treatment. sure, OP and the grandfather didn't have official obligations, but man, grandpa especially, did his heart not feel for the brother?", "I\u2019m not just talking about when brother was 15. I\u2019m talking about his entire life where OP was happy to look the other way.\n\nSure he was young too. But now as an adult with a child of his own, one would hope he might have gained some perspective.", "NTA\n\nBut your brother is alive, and your grandfather is dead. Your brother seemed to have a good heart and wanted a warm family like you had. Maybe you could see if he would want to have a relationship (provided you stay out of red hot issues). You could have a relationship that is beneficial for your child. Because as your child gets older, he or she will be a brat or will be angry at you, and it's nice to have a younger aunt or uncle that can provide a different perspective to your child about why you do the things you do.", "It is impressive, but you have to remember that the grandfather hasn't thought about these people for years. And years later, he's working or relaxing, and a teenager appears at his door. And he suddenly starts demanding that the grandfather take care of him.

Who is a child, that someone doesn't want, tell an adult their obligations?", "It's clear that the grandfather chose to ignore a clear cry for help because the 15 year old didn't word it right. He was asking to be included because he had no one else and was seeing his brother be loved and cared about and wanted the same.", "No. You have a kid and you accept whatever that may come for you. He clearly was an example for his grandson. There is no expectation for him to include the half brother, but I\u2019d do anything I could for a 15 year old asking me to love him, regardless of relations. If my grandfather did this I would very much question his character.", "Your high expectations for people you don't know will do nothing to make any part of the world a better place. Especially if you're expecting things of them retroactively and even more especially if they are dead.\n\nThat being said, it's great to have high expectations of yourself. It's even fine to have high expectations for others, as long as you don't try to inappropriately impose them on those others. But you know that and, apparently, think doing it anyway is somehow a service to the world. Which explains alot.\n\nHave a decent evening.", "Poor half brother, literally everyone around him sucks ass.", "Nah. But I feel really bad for your half brother.
