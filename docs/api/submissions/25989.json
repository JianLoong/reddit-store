There were issues when he was a kid and he wanted to spend time with my grandfather and tag along when I saw him. So he was telling me that he felt like I should have considered his feelings when naming my son. He told me that it hurt him to see me honor and idealize someone who rejected him on multiple occasions and wouldn't even include him as a small part of the family. He said he always felt like my grandfather was the reason I see him as my half brother instead of my brother. I told him what I named my son had nothing to do with him and saying all that was pointless to me.\n\nNow for background: My dad died when I was 7. He and my mom were in a very unstable relationship. Always on and off again. My grandpa, who was dad's dad, was a rock for me. He was the first person I came out to and supported me during that. He supported me during dad's death.

It's clear that your grandfather played a significant role in your life, providing support and stability during challenging times. You chose to honor his memory by naming your son after him, which is a personal and meaningful decision.\n\nYour half brother's feelings of hurt and exclusion are also valid, given his desire to be a part of the family and his perception of your grandfather's actions. It's understandable that he feels a sense of rejection and abandonment.\n\nIn this situation, it's not about determining who is right or wrong but rather about finding a way to communicate and understand each other's emotions and perspectives. Consider having a heartfelt conversation with your half brother, expressing your reasons for naming your son after your grandfather and acknowledging his feelings of hurt. Encourage an open dialogue to bridge the gap and potentially find a way to rebuild your relationship. It may take time and effort, but it's essential to strive for understanding and reconciliation.", "NTA.\nYour brother needs to see a therapist.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
