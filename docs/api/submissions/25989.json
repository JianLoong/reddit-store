I\u2019m sure being so young he was young and jealous and craved the love and support you got. It makes sense that any kid would want that too, and he does *deserve* to be loved. However, saying that your own grandfather who has had no relationship to him prior suddenly \u201cowes him\u201d is a very entitled and just wrong way to go about asking for some live and attention. I do feel bad that he had so suffer, and saw that the only one around him that could maybe make him as happy as you would be your grandfather, so he craved that, but trying to force it and acting in such a way isn\u2019t the way to go about it. Unfortunately considering the general idea of his parents, I\u2019m sure he never really had a proper parental figure to teach him how to handle his emotions. \n\nBut still, no excuse, especially *years later* to be complaining about what you decide to name your child. Your grandfather was important to you, and even if he denied your half brother, none of that is on you or your child at all.

My half sister wanted NOTHING to do with me and it seriously fucked me up. Our circumstances are obviously different from yours\u2026 but the impact she had on me is lifelong. I\u2019m 38 and the damage she caused to me still affects me a lot, even though I can explain a lot of it logically. When I was little I didn\u2019t understand (still don\u2019t really) why someone who was supposed to love me didn\u2019t. That fucks with you. \n\nIt was similar with my brother but he was always friendly and he confused me a lot. He had children and eventually he (mostly via his wife) ended up reaching out. I have a great relationship with him now, and we understand a lot more about the things we went through and didn\u2019t have control over. I have strong bonds with my niblings. I am so glad to have them in my life. The pain and hurt is still there, it will never really go away. But there\u2019s also love and acceptance there now. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if deep down your brother really wants to be a good uncle to your child. I know when my nieces were born\u2026 I wanted to be there for them SO BAD. I didn\u2019t want them to ever feel rejected and unloved like I did growing up. And it caused me a LOT of pain when I didn\u2019t think I could be there for them, and that they might feel this rejection even though I loved them so much. But it turned out my brother actually did want me around in his life, and I\u2019ve been able to give my niblings love and support their whole lives.

You aren't in the wrong.\n\nYour half-brother was clearly feeling left out by his biological family and was hoping to be included in yours.

That he just wants to be included a little bit. To have someone to rely on every now and then. To feel included and loved like OP was, maybe the grandfather would have been more open. It was a little crappy of the grandfather to just refuse to let the poor kid hang out with them, but it\u2019s also not his responsibility anyways, and I\u2019m sure the grandfather enjoyed quality time alone with his biological grandson. But to just show up unannounced and demand the same treatment because he \u201cowes him\u201d and he should do it because he\u2019s a good grandfather to OP is entitled and probably ruined any chance he had of being accepted and seen in a positive light. However, at 15, he\u2019s old enough to be aware of his actions and think for himself, but the true AHs here are the parents who make such a terrible living situation and neglect their child, causing him to grow up alone and without the proper care and education to fully understand and appropriately act on his emotions", "This is where OP could put on his older mature big brother hat and give some compassionate mentorship to a struggling young man dealing with his feelings.

Understanding how hard it must have been for a poor neglected kid, having to be home alone either by himself or with his toxic parents and their volatile relationship, while his half brother got to go out and get love from a family member. His loneliness caused him to make rash decisions and choose some bad words. No one taught him how to understand his jealousy or how to not act entitled due to it, even at 15 if he grew up such a way of course there\u2019s going to be mistakes and issues. I want to be understanding of OP and his grandfather, because it\u2019s true that they didn\u2019t have any responsibility over him, but it would have been nice if they could provide him with at least some care or support, even though they don\u2019t have to. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the half brother is still in this entitled stage of thinking, and he\u2019s in the wrong for trying to make this situation of baby naming all about him and his feelings, and not let OP just have good memories of his grandfather. But when you have no one by your side in the first place and end up with toxic behavior because of neglectful parents, it\u2019s hard to find anyone to put up with you and help you learn how to undo that trauma. While adults *should* be able to think for themselves and learn from actions, when it starts at such a young age its hard to get out of that hole yourself, and it just gets worse as you get older.
