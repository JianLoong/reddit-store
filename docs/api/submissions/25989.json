I mean at 15? He's literally just asking to be part of a family for a little bit. That hurt my heart. \n\nYou're NTA for naming your kids what you want. But I am going to go against the grain and say YTA for not sticking up for him when you were kids.", "NTA for the baby name. \n\nBut Jesus Christ, you didn't need to rub salt in your brother's childhood wounds. Your grandfather was a cruel asshole to one of his grandchildren, rejected a child who was begging for someone to love him, and you just affirmed that sense of loneliness by telling him that his feelings don't matter to you.", "NTA but it seems to me like your half brother quite literally has nobody to go to and no family to fall back on\u2026it\u2019s not your responsibility to nurture and take care of him because he\u2019s an adult now but i think you at least owe him some sympathy and understanding\u2026at the end of the day we all seek out family, love, and support, just like you OP did when you were coming out, he deserves that kind of care as well \n\nyou\u2019re NTA though, I think you were both brought up in kind of difficult situations and it\u2019s not your job as his brother to deal with what he\u2019s going through in his life, he also has no right to make demands about your future child because that is YOUR child and just because he had a bad relationship with your grandfather doesn\u2019t mean that your relationship with your grandfather is somehow \u201cinvalidated\u201d now\u2026", ">I told him ... saying all that was pointless to me.\n\nYTA for this response. Obviously what you name your child is up to you, but it's a shame you couldn't be bothered to extend a shred of empathy to your brother when he shared his feelings, just as your grandfather did for you when you came out to him.\n\nI feel bad for him. He didn't get the support he deserved as a kid. While he's technically an adult, he's still young and is obviously having a hard time processing the shit he went through as a result of your family's complicated dynamic.", "It shows you have no empathy for ur brother because you dont even see him as your own blood. All my siblings are half siblings but never has there been a day i called them my half sis or half bro they are my brothers and my sisters. You allowed someone to drive a wedge between you and ur brother something that makes you think ur brother is different and doesnt deserve the same upbringing as you because you guys havw different dads and you arent accepting of him. Basically you and ur grandpa only ever saw him as a bastard child and now he has grown to adulthood without over coming these core issues from his childhood... probably unpopular opinion.\n\n YTA not for naming ur kid after gpa but for alienating your own brother. Truth is neither of you asked to come into this world form ur parents so you should have always seen it as you and ur brother are in it together but you let someone convince you probably ur grandpa that hes not really ur brother", "NTA. Honestly neither is your half brother. I felt for him so badly :(", "This story is so sad and I\u2019m surprised at the comments. Why is it so hard to muster up any empathy for your brother? Your grandpa doesn\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d him anything and sure he came in a demanding way but he was still a broken child looking for an escape. Your grandfather didnt have to financially support him he could have just let him visit often. That boy is still the brother of his grandson. When he was 15 you were ALREADY an adult. Why didn\u2019t you spend time with him and let him have an outlet with you(excluding your grandpa). I\u2019m sorry but this post just angered me. Sure he has no right to tell you what to name your child but after sternly putting that boundary up why not just talk things out with him? No family and Destructive parents and the one person who can understand him shuns him.", "YTA I think it was fine naming your son after your grandfather. I think you've been terrible to your brother and showed no sympathy. You've basically said how terrible your mother is and your grandfather was the only stability in your life, but are clueless to why your brother wanted that. He can't help who is parents are no more than you can help who your mother is. Show him some love.", "NAH\n\nYour naming choices are yours and your husband's decision and tour grandfather was someone who was very important in your life. But my heart breaks for your brother who at 15 pretty much begged for even a drop of love and concern and I do think your grandfather could've been more compassionate and I understand why he feels rejected. He is  not within his rights to demand that you should've taken his feelings into consideration when naming your child, especially since you 2 are not even close, but he's only 21 and still learning. Right now he's just hurting.", "Your entire story is irrelevant. Your grandpa could have shit on your half-brother's forehead, and then skull humped him for all I care. It's your kid, name him what you want. And your half-bro isn't an assho either because he can be upset if he likes as long as he eventually drops it. He has a right to feel hurt if he chooses.\nNAH", "I agree. I do not think the brother should have demanded anything, but a 15 year old kid having the guts to ask an adult for support is impressive. Spending some time with a struggling kid doesn\u2019t cost anything. If there is any asshole, it might be your grandfather. I have a half sister and have never considered her anything other than just my sister and I\u2019d do anything for her just like my full brother. Her grandmother has always treated me nicely (or yelled at me) just like she does her bio grandchildren. He was the kid and your grandfather was the adult. He should have acted like one.", "No, i agree with this. It\u2019s easier to be like this when you\u2019re not in those shoes but of course would OP want his son to go through the same treatment? He has ever right to the name but their attitudes to me is what is bad.", "Yeah, admittedly the brother came on strong when asking/demanding a relationship with the grandpa, but he was also 15. Grandpa could have at least been a little kinder about it. The brother doesn't really have much of a leg to stand on at this point. Maybe if they had kept in contact throughout the years, but it sounds like the brother contacted OP out of the blue about it. This is a close one between NAH and NTA, but I'd have to go NTA in the end.", "But, Grandpa doesn't want a bonus grandson, and there is nothing wrong with that.", "This, the sheer number of people supporting this cruelty is beyond me, yeah the bro wasn't very nice, but what do you expect from someone in that situation? OP might have found a drastic improvement in their relationship if he was there for him when he needed him.", "How in the world can you say OP\u2019s half brother is some random kid?", "BEGONE, BOT", "Your grandpa didn\u2019t owe him anything,", "Nta. You had a close relationship with him so why not name your child in honor.", "Your parents did their best to fuck him up, there\u2019s no point in you picking up the tradition - you\u2019ve got a kid now, set a good example.", "This. I just can't imaging turning away a kid asking to be loved. No matter how I was related to them, if at all.", "I agree NAH: I can\u2019t imagine turning away a child wanting to be loved were i in the grandfather\u2019s position. The brother has been let down by all the adults in his life.", "this so much.  people are acting here like every adult should treasure and supply love and affection to every single kid.", "Yeah I think it is. It's too...alien.", "Because that's what he is to his grandfather...", "Of course they wouldn\u2019t. Talk is real cheap on this site.", "by doing what?  They don't have a relationship, they don't even talk most of the time.  What is a good example?  Maybe he should show his newborn son(I think hard to tell) what a good person he is by changing his(son's) name because it upset some kid of some guy his mom married.  \n\nBeing nice and support is one thing, but I think some of you are bringing up past trauma of your own.  It is insane for anyone but your partner to think they can tell you what to name your child.  Sure grandpa is a poopy person for being mean to a kid.  this post is not about grandpa.  it's about a new child that definitely doesn't need to be embroiled in family drama before he's even started in life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP NTA.  you don't owe your step-brother just cause you lived in the same house.  would you even listen to your \"full\" sibling if they said you can't name your kid that because it makes me upset?", "Yeah, there's no \"I\" in it. Even with well thought out responses, there's usually some amount of personality or reference to themselves, (I think, I feel, I know etc.) It's not a bad response, but definitely sounds more like something you would read in a textbook or something.", "The grandfather was a cruel asshole to the half brother. He objectively WAS half brother's grandfather but rejected a kid who was begging for someone to love him.", "I didn't realize begging someone to love you automatically means you're entitled to that love. OP'S  half brother showed up at grandpa's house and demanded equal treatment despite the fact that there is zero relation between them. Should my sister's in laws treat me the same as her because we're sisters? OP's mom is the one at fault here for destroying her son's chance at a family.", "How is someone who was not one of the half brother's parents' parents \"objectively\" the half brother's grandfather?"]}
