After a few times they took the dog elsewhere to poop.  But since you have a big dog which means bigger poops take your dog to their lawn and have it poop there and don't pick it up. Wave to them as you leave. If they complain which they will just respond with I thought that's what we were doing letting each other dogs poop in the lawn. No?

So many neighbors were so angry with her. Finally I had enough of it happening in my yard.  I went inside and got a plastic storage bag, wrote the words this belongs to you on the bag, and went out picked up the poop in the bag.

Heck, what if your dog got a little too excited and bouncy, and accidentally hurt the little dog? Or tried to play with it and hurt it?
