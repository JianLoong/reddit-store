As long as Stella is friendly and well trained, no issues from me!", "NTA for messing with your neighbours. They are rude and letting their dog shit all over your lawn without picking it up. \n\nBut YTA to your dog. Everyone thinks their dog would never fight or bite someone/somedog. But it\u2019s a dog, they don\u2019t speak our language and are never 100% predictable. If the tiny dog got spooked and bit yours and your dog got mad about that and hurt the tiny dog you could be on the hook for vet bills and/or dealing with your dog killed your neighbours dog. Depending on the laws where you are - your dog may have been taken away and/or put to sleep. \n\nUse your words next time instead of sending your dog in to do your dirty work, and if that doesn\u2019t work - check your local bylaws and report it to them. If you want to be passive aggressive start letting your dog shit on their lawn and don\u2019t pick it up. lol but don\u2019t put your dog at risk to make a point.", "NTA\n\nBut don't use your dog to scare off theirs. It only takes one time for their dog to get injured (even if it was an accident and not a physical action of your dog, eg theirs tripped or got stuck in something) and suddenly your dog is declared the aggressor.\n\nHowever, I'd say get a security camera and record their dog taking it's dump on your lawn. Send them a written notice to pick up after their dog. If they don't start, I'd start flinging their dog's turds back on their lawn with a shovel, make sure they scatter and splat.", "YTA, but also justified. \n\nOther comments have pointed out that you could have put your dog in danger. That's that. \n\nI would advise getting a security camera so that you have proof if this ever escalates, whether it's the between the humans or the dogs. \n\nPersonally, I'd gather the shit and kindly return it to their mailbox. . .
