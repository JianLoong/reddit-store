As long as Stella is friendly and well trained, no issues from me!", "NTA for messing with your neighbours. They are rude and letting their dog shit all over your lawn without picking it up. \n\nBut YTA to your dog. Everyone thinks their dog would never fight or bite someone/somedog. But it\u2019s a dog, they don\u2019t speak our language and are never 100% predictable. If the tiny dog got spooked and bit yours and your dog got mad about that and hurt the tiny dog you could be on the hook for vet bills and/or dealing with your dog killed your neighbours dog. Depending on the laws where you are - your dog may have been taken away and/or put to sleep. \n\nUse your words next time instead of sending your dog in to do your dirty work, and if that doesn\u2019t work - check your local bylaws and report it to them. If you want to be passive aggressive start letting your dog shit on their lawn and don\u2019t pick it up. lol but don\u2019t put your dog at risk to make a point.", "NTA\n\nBut don't use your dog to scare off theirs. It only takes one time for their dog to get injured (even if it was an accident and not a physical action of your dog, eg theirs tripped or got stuck in something) and suddenly your dog is declared the aggressor.\n\nHowever, I'd say get a security camera and record their dog taking it's dump on your lawn. Send them a written notice to pick up after their dog. If they don't start, I'd start flinging their dog's turds back on their lawn with a shovel, make sure they scatter and splat.", "YTA, but also justified. \n\nOther comments have pointed out that you could have put your dog in danger. That's that. \n\nI would advise getting a security camera so that you have proof if this ever escalates, whether it's the between the humans or the dogs. \n\nPersonally, I'd gather the shit and kindly return it to their mailbox. . .

Just to prove a point? To be funny? Dogs behave unpredictably sometimes, even if you're \"100%\" certain of what you *think* they're going to do. What if Stella had unexpectedly hurt the other dog? What if the other dog had hurt Stella (yes, small dogs can still hurt big ones)? What if a car had sped up the street unexpectedly?\n\nYou and your neighbour both need to keep your dogs on leashes when they're not in a fenced yard on private property or at an off-leash area.

After the first week and a civil but firm conversation, I can see my husband bagging their dog\u2019s poop, storming across the street and hand delivering it with some spicy words.

Assert dominance over your territory, OP!", "My neighbor  used to let his doberman shit in my yard. I shoveled it up and started throwing in his boat. Problem solved.  When a neighbor rudely violates your space it's fair to retaliate. They bring it on themselves.  Dogs I have no problem with, owners...  Going through something similar again. Told the owner no more. He lets his small dog loose in my yard \"so it won't tangle with my big dogs lead. But then allows it to crap in my yard repeatedly and scrub it's ass on a deck carpet.

He acts like it's no big deal, WTF?", "Exactly. You don't want to get your dog labeled a nuisance, even if you could counter argue that the little one is as well.

She can still scare them away, but she doesn\u2019t need to be crossing the street.", "I\u2019m sure if you continue to let your dog out in your yard - not across the street- whenever you see them nearby, they will quickly stop letting their dog into your yard.", "I do actually hang out out there quite a bit but she\u2019s always tied up. I get that a lot of people are afraid of big dogs."]}
