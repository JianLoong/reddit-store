{"id": 20792, "submission_id": "14ku8um", "title": "AITA for kicking my maid of honour/wedding planner out of my wedding because she had hay fever?", "selftext": "I (25F) have always wanted to have a traditional dream wedding. I spoke about this with my two best friends (both 25F) all the time. One of my best friends is a police officer but she took time off work to help me prepare. I told her I didn\u2019t have enough money to pay for a wedding planner, plus everything else I already had to do. She has a gift when it comes to organising things so she offered to plan it for me for free; I was so incredibly grateful that I allowed her to be my maid of honour as well. \n\nShe did everything perfectly and the wedding turned out fine, but at the same time, the wedding took place in summer and it was outdoors. My best friend started sneezing constantly, during the speeches and otherwise. She had taken medication for it to try to get it under control but the sneezing just didn\u2019t stop.\nMy husband (25M) isn\u2019t the biggest fan of her and they\u2019ve never gotten along, so when he came up to me and asked me to make her leave, as she was not only disrupting the service but making the other guests uncomfortable, I had no choice but to listen. I let her do her speech as maid of honour but afterwards, I told her that due to the hay fever, my husband and I think it\u2019s best if you go home. She wasn\u2019t allowed to come to the after party either, even though it was inside. I wanted her there but my husband didn\u2019t (they have been enemies since high school). She was furious as not only was she the reason that wedding happened, considering she did it for free but she was also the maid of honour. \n\nThe wedding was about 10 days ago and I\u2019ve tried to call her to apologise and explain the situation but she has been ignoring me ever since. \n\nAm I The A**hole?\n\n\nEdit: if you have seen her side of the story which she posted. She got permanently banned from the sub for violating rule 11 so it\u2019s been taken down. I will post her version in the comments since she can\u2019t.  \n\nEdit 2 : I\u2019m done answering on this topic and all others. I\u2019ve got my feedback, thank you. Some will believe, some won\u2019t. Either way, I know my truth and there\u2019s more than meets the eye with this story.", "created_utc": 1687911340, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ku8um/aita_for_kicking_my_maid_of_honourwedding_planner/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're no friend. I'd block your number.", "YTA.  And so is your husband.  You two deserve each other.", "YTA. This looks like you just used her as a wedding planner and ditched her once it was convenient.

I can understand asking her to step aside during the ceremony if she was disruptive, but to uninvite her to the party was such an asshole move.

She's better off without a freeloading friend like you.", "YTA - You bullied and excluded your friend after she helped you", "YTA. Sneezes happen. The common sense thing to do would have been to invite her to wait inside until her sneezing cleared so she would feel better or to just join the party later, which was inside.

You could have asked her if she was okay when she was sneezing up a storm and if she wanted to wait somewhere away from allergens until the indoor part. You could have invited her back to the indoor part. You even waited until AFTER her speech to kick her out. You managed to squeeze every use you wanted from her then kicked her to the curb. Wow. Your husband is a real AH too. I guess the only way (maybe) that you both aren't total AHs is if they are enemies because of something terrible she did in the past that he can't forgive her for. Barring that, you both are huge HUGE AHs. This wasn't even about the hay fever. Your husband just didn't want her there period and you went along with it. Did you even have this conversation with him before the wedding to see how he felt with having his mortal enemy at the wedding and letting her help plan the whole thing? I guess he was fine with THAT.", "Absolutely 100% YTA and a really shitty friend on top of it.\n\nWhat an astoundingly awful thing to do. Wow!  Your husband is just as bad too.", "YTA. I don\u2019t blame her for not speaking to you.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re calling it hay fever to make yourself feel better. It\u2019s just allergies.

You watched him continue to abuse her as you all grew into adulthood and you continued to date him. You hid facts about your relationship with her & her involvement in your wedding because he\u2019d become come abusive to both of you. You allowed him to kick her out of the wedding she planned & banned from any involvement because you didn\u2019t want to anger him because you knew you\u2019d be subjected to his abuse and anger.

You had a choice, defend the person who helped organize everything.\nI hope she realizes now that you are not a real friend to her. First, you married her bully, and then you kick her out.", "AITA for reducing involvement with a close friend after she let her manipulative husband kick me out of a wedding I planned?\n\nHER SIDE OF THE STORY | SHES BANNED SO SHE CANT POST OR COMMENT \n\n\nY'all have probably seen the first one that she made and since she wants to make one about me, I figured that it's only fitting that I give my side of the story. \n\nI have been in a trio since high school. Me and my two best friends. We met when we were 15. We are now 25 turning 26. We all work in law enforcement.\nI'm a cop and my two best friends are firefighters.\n\nOne of my best friends recently got married. Now, I don't like her husband and I haven't from the time we were kids but I can't make her choose between us as she knew him first. He and his group of boys didn't like me in high school as they said \"I wasn't pretty enough to be liked.\" I expressed my feelings to my feelings to her in a nice way because that was still her bf and I wanted to be respectful. The two of them got into countless of arguments because of it. We learned to be civil for her sake. I've always hated the way he treats her. He's manipulative, narcissistic and the biggest gaslighter I've ever seen. He's been showing these signs since high school. I've told her about it multiple times but she's blinded by love. She told me that she was trying to find a wedding planner, but she was struggling as that would cost her way too much. Because of this, I told her that I would plan the whole thing for her for free.\n\nShe was very grateful for it and told me to be her maid of honour. It was always between me and our other best friend, and I guess she was trying to figure out who deserved it more, and I guess that pushed her towards me.\n\nFast forward to the wedding, I was definitely sneezing a lot. I went into the main hall where the afterparty would've been taken place to try and calm down, but the guests were uncomfortable because they didn't know that I had hayfever, and they thought I was sick. I get why she did not want me there for the remainder of the reception. My sneezing has stopped for a bit and I did my speech and then I saw her talking to her husband for a while and then she came up to me and told me that I had to leave and due to her husband being uncomfortable with the fact that I am sneezing, he doesn't want me at the after party either. She said that if it was up to her she would've 100% allowed me to be there but she didn't want to go against him, because she knew how he was.\n\nI was livid, not only because I took unpaid leave off work to help her plan this for free, but I was also her maid of honour and her supposed \"best friend\", and once again she was letting her vindictive husband tell her what to do. It's been 10 to 11 days since the wedding now and I am not speaking to her at the moment. She has left me countless of messages. However I have texted her after seeing her post on Reddit and we are going to meet up tomorrow to discuss this properly.", "I have a feeling that you're upset you're getting mostly Y T A votes and are desperately trying to turn this around so you made another post making your husband out to be an abusive monster and that's why you kicked out your friend.

It's an allergy.  She wasn't sneezing AT you.  Yes, YTA.", "YTA and I'm pretty sure you lost a friend. Honestly I'm surprised she put up with you marrying her \"enemy\" let alone volunteer to plan the whole thing for free! Your husband sounds like a controlling dick and you suck as a friend", "I don\u2019t have to read this to know YTA", " YTA\n\nFirst thing to call out: You massively insulted your maid of honor. If anyone ask you just tell them she\u2019s got allergies. If they don\u2019t like it they can figure out a solution for themselves. \n\nSecond thing: I just read the post you did from her perspective and she\u2019s clearly seeing some red flags you aren\u2019t. She\u2019s looking out for you and you dropped her so quick because your husband doesn\u2019t like her. Come on, Mary. If your husband is any kind of upstanding adult he would NEVER ask his brand new wife to kick out her maid of honor. I\u2019d be wary of him. \n\nHonestly, this whole thing is a major dick move. Again, you\u2019re the asshole, big time.", "YTA, and if I were her I would have made the biggest scene and done anything in my power to absolutely destroy the rest of the wedding for you.

I hope you don't have any other parties to plan since you burned that bridge.", "OP will be posting on r/divorce at some point. Hopefully it's before all of his bullying and abuse directed at her fully breaks down her self esteem and she finds herself alienated from all of her friends and family. She already doesn't want to give him reasons to \"flip out,\" meaning she's already afraid of his anger. The fact that she just gave in to his demand and threw her lifelong best friend out like yesterday's wet newspaper without so much as a whisper of disagreement tells me all I need to know.\n\nOP, you are in an abusive relationship and this is only the beginning of what he's going to put you through.

You uninvited the person who helped you the most from the part of the wedding that she would have been fine at. You had no choice but to listen to your husband?

You and your husband are awful", "Yta how exactly do you think you can explain it? Actions speak louder than words.", "OP is definitely the A H. Kicking hetout was just low and almost nasty. Then again,  but why would she have a moh that her husband hates. Why would he be ok with her do wedding planning if he hates her.

I hope you got a lot of good photos because I doubt that you'll have much else to show for your marriage within a few years.", "You were always going to invite her, you were always going to let her do all the work, but it didn't take much convincing to kick her out. \n\n *I shouldn\u2019t have to pick between my best friend and my husband that\u2019s not fair.* \n\nShe wasn't the one making you pick.", "Thank you for the extra info. Reading that, it makes me feel your husband is the real AH for making you choose between a rock and a hard place on your wedding night. You're right - starting a marriage with a fight on the wedding night would definitely suck so I don't envy you for having to deal with that. What you both did was still an AH move, and you partly caused this by hiding that she planned the whole thing. I think you know what you did was super not cool so all you can do now is repent and hope that your friend will hear you out. I wouldn't blame her though because wedding planning is HARD and she could have charged you a hefty sum for her services but she did it all for free. I would guess she now feels like you've chosen sides and your friendship will probably disappear now that you're married to someone that hates her guts. \n\nDo you know why he hates her so much? Is this just petty high school drama that has gone on too long or is this something that could be justifiable for kicking his bride's MOH out of the wedding for? I feel if he agreed to let her be MOH, he just should have bit the bullet and stomached it for you.", "No this is her pov - respond to her not me. She can\u2019t post it as she was banned. She\u2019s made a new account will respond once she has Karma.", "Her pov - this post is about whether you think she\u2019s the a hole. She can\u2019t comment or post as she\u2019s banned. I posted it for her as she can\u2019t.", "100% wrote this herself to make her look less of an AH. Didn't work, you're the AH.\n\nSering as you work in law enforcement (wouldn't call firefighters law enforcement but emergency responders) you would.know there are resources and support for those in abusive situations. Why didn't you ask your former beat friend \"ride or die\" for help, she's a cop, she's know the law, domestic abuse is bread and butter for the police? She doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.", "Why would I write it? Surely this makes me look just as bad. She texted me saying that she got banned but she wanted to say her side. I told her I would post it under mine so at least people would see it. I haven\u2019t altered anything she said at all. Like I said, when she has enough karma, she will comment for herself but she obviously has to wait otherwise it will get taken down.", "Yep", "how about instead of playing word games jsut be upfront that you want out of the situation. \n\nYou chose to marry this person no one put a gun to your head and made you", "A workaround?  You can't get out of?  You married this cretin.", "Work around? You married him. Your an ah to yourself.", "If you married an abusive man, please get help. But you\u2019re also the asshole for how you behaved. You can be a victim AND also a toxic friend, especially when you\u2019re now using said situation for justification and when you got pressed about it, immediately threw your husband under the bus. Your friend deserved better. Your husband deserves someone who loves him (basic human decency). YTA.", "Why tf did you marry him then? You are lucky if she still wants to be your friend. I certainly would not. You take advantage of your friends and kick them to the curb, when you are done. Shame on you. You are a terrible friend", "And MARRYING your abuser would........make it better?", "Hey OP I\u2019ve just read this post. It sounds like you\u2019ve been with him for all your adult life and then some more. Is there family you can talk to? \n\nYou know you were the YTA in this situation but perhaps let this incident be the straw which broke the camels back. It\u2019s easy for people to say \u201cbreak up\u201d but if there\u2019s domestic abuse involved then you need to get your exit plan sorted. Reach out and reach out some more. Keep safe OP.", "Hun you need to get out of this relationship. Get your ducks in a row. At the very least if you won\u2019t do it for yourself, your kids don\u2019t deserve a childhood of fear and abuse. It\u2019s never too late to get out.", "This is on you. Why were you marrying him a s digging yourself deeper into this hole?", "There's a point before being engaged that one person in the relationship asks if you want to get married. At that point you can find any excuse to delay this happening or get out of the relationship. \n\nYour best friend is cop. Ask for her help to get out if you are so scared of him. There are so many ways for someone to get out of a toxic relationship now. We are not in the 50s anymore.", "Have you talked to her about this? Shared your fear of him? I know it\u2019s easier said than done to leave but I think you can start by documenting his toxicity and talking honestly with your maid of honor.", "The wording you're looking for is \"I asked her to be my maid of honour\".", "Oh I missed that bit.

What the hell is she thinking?", "I was dating him before she transferred to my school. I didn\u2019t even know her when we started dating in freshman year and she transferred in SOPHOMORE.", "Maybe OP wanted to use the anger and rage people feel against trigger happy cops and hate the lovely MOH from the get go? \n\nWhen you know you're the AH in the story, you'd try to paint the other party in a bad way. I think it's OP's way of doing that.", "I assume it\u2019s to show she is not a professional wedding or event planner", "No she got a bad reaction to her post so now she\u2019s claiming to be the victim.", "> The dating pool breathes a collective sigh of relief\n\nMind if I borrow this.? Normally I wouldn't give two fucks, and straight up steal it, but I'm feeling generous today.", "Ride or die, as in Best friends pays for the bike and then she can just die, while OP rides off into the sunset.", "Bet OP just wanted a free wedding planner", "Not only that but also treats OP like trash.

You see how bad the story makes you look and still aren't sure if yta?", "INFO: are you the bride or the MOH? This is getting confusing.", "Whatever whatever. Moral of the story is, \nYou're spineless. Also quite an asshole for letting this problem grow from highschool to now. Also, if you have no money, then go to a courthouse and sign the documents and be done with it. Exploiting other for your dream wedding is such a loser move. \nYour husband is a leeching trash that even garbage cans would topple over to throw him out. \nYour best friend has a bad luck when it comes to friendship.", "It\u2019s not that simple", "Yeah no, fuck that. If I became friends with the new kid and my current boyfriend started bullying them like an immature asshole, that relationship would have ended very quickly. Doesn't matter how long the relationship was, bullies are gross, and it's a GLARING red flag. And then you still got married to him, despite the fact that HE IS STILL A BULLY at 25 fucking years old. Just admit that you don't care about your friend and be done with it so she can find better friends.", "So what?
