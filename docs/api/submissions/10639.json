You did not grow up with it, never practiced it. Genetic culture is not practical culture. If you were from a culture that practices genital mutilation, would you succumb to that so as not to offend your uncle? \n\nThe fact that your uncle was offended makes me question his motives.

You weren't rude, but anyone who doesn't respect your boundaries is.", "NTA Fellow Finn here. As a child I bathed same time as my parents. When I started to hit puberty or little before I started to prefer to go to sauna alone. Parents had 2 choices a clean or smelly child. So no fuss or fighting they chose the clean child. Traditionally when big gatherings we divide sauna groups to one of these : men/boys and women/girls or one family at time. Small children (both girls and boys) usually are allowed to  run in and out sauna as they will as long as they are behaving. How your uncle behaved was disrespectful towards you. Your parents might be stuck thinking how you and your siblings bathed in sauna when you were small is how you should do it as an adult. \n\nSauna is not only for washing and cleaning your body but also time relax your mind from everyday stress and noices. Thus your uncle demanding for you to be naked in sauna same time as him would have increased your stress and anxiety noices therefore your uncle is the AH.\n\nI wish you most relaxing sauna times in the future.\n\nEdit: added a word", "NTA.\n\nNo one else gets to decide for you when you should be comfortable being naked.

And while you might enjoy many aspects of Finnish culture with which you were raised, you were not raised in a family that hung out naked in saunas (or anywhere else) together.  So that aspect of Finnish culture is not natural to you, and makes you extremely uncomfortable.\n\nYou are under no obligation to ANYONE to be nude when it makes you uncomfortable.  There is nothing wrong, or rude, or prudish, or impolite about choosing not to be naked around your family or anyone else.  It's your body and your choice.  \n\nThe A's here are the people who are trying to pressure and guilt you into joining them naked in the sauna when you choose not to do so.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with their choice to go in the sauna, but there's nothing wrong with your choice either.", "NTA.  Not your culture at that point, heritage yes.  You were raised in the UK with UK cultural boundaries on nudity.", "No AH here (except maybe your mom).  This is a cultural thing. It's perfectly normal for sauna nudity, but if you are uncomfortable, then you shouldn't feel pressured to participate.You do you, and don't worry about being an AH.

It probably is his first.", "My brother has a rule that shoes aren't allowed in the house.

Consent involves so much more than just sex.", "You can\u2019t just say we should abolish a whole culture just because you don\u2019t agree with them. You\u2019d really hate most Islamic cultures if you think all cultures should treat consent exactly the same. Women aren\u2019t allowed to say no to something a man wants. Also, up until now they probably didn\u2019t have anyone say no so they didn\u2019t know how to handle it or what to think. It takes time for people to adjust to things.", "I do hate most Islamic cultures and most religious cultures of any kind because nearly all of them violate consent so blatantly and horribly that it's just disgusting.\nThe fact that we do not treat consent equally in the world is very disturbing\nI genuinely do not care about other people's cultures if their cultures involve harming anyone for any reason."]}
