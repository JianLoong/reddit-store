When I think of muumuus I literally think of my grandmother. You deserve to feel comfy in your own home but your husband also deserves to not be forced into sex when he doesnt want it. You mentioned him wearing sweats and a hoodie but I think thats not a good comparison. Imagine if he was wearing whatever you associate with your grandfather.

Just because you are happy with him wearing sweatpants and hoodies doesn\u2019t mean he has to be happy with your muumuus. If you aren\u2019t actually happy with his casual wear, tell him that.

However, it\u2019s totally fair for him to not be turned on by something that you\u2019re wearing. If your mumus truly are the source of his reluctance to be intimate, then you\u2019re simply placing your comfort above all else.

It wasn't the pj's itself that was causing issues with being attractive and wanting to do naughty things. He couldn't think of an item of clothing that would do that. His actual words were, \"You're my Marilyn Monroe, you could wear a potato sack, and I'd still be attracted to you.\" The issue was he felt like I had just given up on caring for myself.

I went from that to minimum makeup (sometimes) when I worked and pj's with only residual makeup on. We got to the point we did because he didn't know how to bring it up to me in a way that wouldn't cause hurt and issues. And despite anything else, the attraction issues were not by choice exactly.

The ex who had the most to say about my appearance was taking gross advantage of my physical and emotional labor, had issues with work that eventually lead to him getting fired, and was a bit below average looks-wise. At the end of the relationship, I was the only one doing chores aside from him occasionally cooking beans and rice for himself, and I was the only one with a paycheck. He had a hundred pounds on me but was getting pissy about the twenty extra I had on me. 5\u20194 and 160 lbs versus 5\u20198 and 265 lbs. i only had an ass when I was overweight, so before I gained it he was making comments about my pancake ass and how his ex\u2019s ass was fantastic, once I gained weight he made comments about how my cheekbones weren\u2019t as sharp and would pinch my hips and thighs because they had a bit extra weight. that\u2019s how bodies work, you can\u2019t control how weight gain is distributed. He went from talking about how out of his league I was (which made me uncomfortable, I was attracted to him and he was attracted to me, why does societal beauty standards matter or need to apply to our relationship?) to making me feel like the ugliest person on earth. He\u2019d make comments about things that literally no one else has ever told me were negatives: my feet were hobbit feet and stupidly small, my lips were too large for a white woman, my eyes were too small, I had hip dips, my torso was too long and my legs were too short, my fingers were too long for my hand, I didn\u2019t shave everything enough for him, I had too basic of a style, I looked like I liked fall and pumpkin spice, my curly hair was too messy because I had multiple curl patterns. \n\nHe had the same haircut he\u2019s had in high school. He didn\u2019t shave his facial hair or groom it appropriately and it made my contact dermatitis act up, so I would refuse to kiss him because newsflash to him, intimacy that results in blisters or a rash on your face isn\u2019t fun, so at one point he forcibly held me down and rubbed his beard all over my body while I cried. He also wondered why I didn\u2019t want to sleep with him after that and why I flinched away. He wasn\u2019t exactly the picture of masculine beauty. As mentioned he was significantly overweight. Credit to him where it\u2019s due, he did lose over a hundred pounds during high school before we met, that took dedication. He was over 400 lbs at his heaviest and I know he was a target for bullies, and it very obviously left damage, but that didn\u2019t excuse what he did to me. That weight loss left sagging skin and stretch marks all over his body, not his fault or under his control but then again, the things he said about me were mostly not under my control either so I feel less bad about this. In retrospect I think a lot of his criticism and verbal abuse were directed at things he hated about himself and projected at me. He only wore graphic tees and khakis or plain black or white shirts that come in packs of five at Walmart . seriously I wonder why I ever let him get to me and make me believe I was neglecting him by not stepping up my style from \u201cthe average 20-something girl next door with maybe a bit more covered but nothing super prudish\u201d -I just didn\u2019t wear crop tops or body con mini dresses to stand next to him wearing a dirty white tee and khakis? I already looked ridiculous next to him because I\u2019d always be overdressed compared to him. He never once took my preferences into account, not even \u201cplease get rid of that white t-shirt because it\u2019s permanently stained yellow by your pits, I\u2019ll even buy you a new pack of the same one you always get\u201d or \u201cyour beard is too rough, if you won\u2019t shave please wash your face and condition the beard with this product I bought for you before trying to kiss me so I don\u2019t have three days of a rash\u201d, yet would get all pissy I wouldn\u2019t spend a bunch of money I didn\u2019t have on completely changing my wardrobe, hairstyle, shoe closet, and body to become the alt girl of his dreams. The thing is, I\u2019d have to undergo extreme plastic surgery to fix half of his list and even then, it\u2019d never be enough because I don\u2019t think I was ever the issue, i think he just was a very unhappy person who couldn\u2019t be self aware so he lashed out and blamed everyone else for his own state of permanent dissatisfaction. His attitude was that It could never be him that was wrong, it wasn\u2019t possible he had depression, he just was a realist who called it like he saw it, and everyone and everything sucked and was out to get him.\n\nI had a really abusive childhood and went through an extreme people pleaser stage in my twenties so it\u2019s not exactly rocket science why I had a bad picker and why I stayed with him for much longer than I should have.
