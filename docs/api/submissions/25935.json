When I think of muumuus I literally think of my grandmother. You deserve to feel comfy in your own home but your husband also deserves to not be forced into sex when he doesnt want it. You mentioned him wearing sweats and a hoodie but I think thats not a good comparison. Imagine if he was wearing whatever you associate with your grandfather.

Just because you are happy with him wearing sweatpants and hoodies doesn\u2019t mean he has to be happy with your muumuus. If you aren\u2019t actually happy with his casual wear, tell him that.

However, it\u2019s totally fair for him to not be turned on by something that you\u2019re wearing. If your mumus truly are the source of his reluctance to be intimate, then you\u2019re simply placing your comfort above all else.
