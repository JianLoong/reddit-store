Second, it doesn\u2019t seem like you charged them because you need the money. More like you needed the recognition that you are just as valuable and successful as they are. \nThird, becoming a vet tech is a noble position taking care of animals. Being a vet has more prestige and less BS to deal with. Your daughter will be better off investing more in her education. I say this as a nurse practitioner that used to work as a nurse; being a provider is more satisfying emotionally because just like doctors were the purpose of the position is to figure out the puzzle. As a nurse, or as your daughter would be doing as a vet tech, was doing the grunt work so a provider can figure out the puzzle. It doesn\u2019t seem like that is the issue though; it seems like you are upset that your parents present that being a vet tech would not be good enough in their eyes. Fourth, as a daughter of a plumber you are more than enough. My father tells this old story: there were three brothers. One went to Yale, one went to college, when asked why the third brother didn\u2019t go to college he replied \u2018someone had to put them through college\u2019\u201d. A man can earn just as much with out a formal education without accumulating all that debit by developing a trade.

You are not really communicating how you feel to your parents and thus you are not even addressing the real problem.\n\nInstead of using the fact that they have an emergency to punish them, you can sit with them a regular day and tell them how you feel undervalued bc they are properly compensating your brother for his help while they are taking your time and effort for granted.\n\nAlso tell them that their vision of what \u2018success\u2019 means is not the only one that matters and they should stop manipulating your daughter, bc she has the right to take her own life choices. And tell them that you are a successful man even if they are blind and cannot see it.\n\nOP if you are passive aggressive instead of asserting how you feel they are never going to be held accountable for what they\u2019re doing, and you are never gonna let go of your resentment.
