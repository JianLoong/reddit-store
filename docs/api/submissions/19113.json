Being a vet has more prestige and less BS to deal with. Your daughter will be better off investing more in her education. I say this as a nurse practitioner that used to work as a nurse; being a provider is more satisfying emotionally because just like doctors were the purpose of the position is to figure out the puzzle. As a nurse, or as your daughter would be doing as a vet tech, was doing the grunt work so a provider can figure out the puzzle. It doesn\u2019t seem like that is the issue though; it seems like you are upset that your parents present that being a vet tech would not be good enough in their eyes. Fourth, as a daughter of a plumber you are more than enough. My father tells this old story: there were three brothers. One went to Yale, one went to college, when asked why the third brother didn\u2019t go to college he replied \u2018someone had to put them through college\u2019\u201d.

You are not really communicating how you feel to your parents and thus you are not even addressing the real problem.\n\nInstead of using the fact that they have an emergency to punish them, you can sit with them a regular day and tell them how you feel undervalued bc they are properly compensating your brother for his help while they are taking your time and effort for granted.\n\nAlso tell them that their vision of what \u2018success\u2019 means is not the only one that matters and they should stop manipulating your daughter, bc she has the right to take her own life choices. And tell them that you are a successful man even if they are blind and cannot see it.\n\nOP if you are passive aggressive instead of asserting how you feel they are never going to be held accountable for what they\u2019re doing, and you are never gonna let go of your resentment.

We were friends, and I was there the day they came in to take it. They were off that day, just told me they forgot to grab something from their locker the day before.

Don't think they see many kittens overall either.", "Vets don't go out of their way to bleed money from people. They're charging what the procedures and medicine actually cost.

Most pet owners SHOULD have petcare insurace, but they don't.", "She might get kicked out of that vet and have to go to a new one (serial euthanasia from what I understand is a huge waste of resources) but there's no governing body that regulates that.

Sounds like you finally made a boundary that should have been in effect the minute you established your business.  I'm always amazed at people who expect their kids who work in the trades to work for free when they have a problem, but their precious lawyers get paid every time they help out.

I don't really give gifts from my crafts anymore, I make a few rare gifts for my loved ones when I feel like it (and never because of a request) because people don't value the time and effort and if you regularly do it, they start to take you for granted. \n\nA random surprise plate is very appreciated, receiving some every few months starts to become an expectation and they don't appreciate that it still takes you the same amount of time to do it every time. Once an expectation is set, not meeting it is seen as a slight. Hence why I try to avoid setting those expectations. To an extent, I don't even blame them.

But that's even more reason to avoid regularity.", "I've always told my children that people who look down on tradespeople are in for a rude awakening when they need a plumber on the weekend.

We don't know how often since OP doesn't really say but my parents have regularish (i.e. annual) communication with lawyers for random tasks that come up.

I guess a lot of it isn't them since they're just handling it for the family as well, but they've definitely been in regular contact with legal assistance for the better part of the last decade. I imagine if you run any side business or something, there will be a lot of additional complications there. \n\nLawyers can be rough to deal with but let's not forget law is still a very much necessary profession. The point of this shouldn't be to shit on someone's career (not saying you're doing that but I've seen other people do that), but more to uplift other careers and remind people that trade professions are perfectly good careers and noble professions that deserve respect.
