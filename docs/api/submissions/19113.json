She should go to university and become a veterinarian. They just kept pushing even after she explained her reasoning. \n\nIt kind of pissed me off.  \n\nSo we had some flooding in our area last week and my parents needed some emergency help.

And I'm not sure how you're \"unsuccessful.\" I don't really see why being a lawyer is any better than having your own plumbing business.

And definitely not an asshole for treating them like a customer and not giving them any special privileges when they don't treat you how they treat your bro. \n\nOne thing I'll say is you should stand up for your daughter and not let them make her feel bad about something she is wanting to do. If she wants to be a vet tech then don't let them keep trying to talk her out of that. I definitely had that stuff happen where I'm choosing to do something and it kind of ruins my excitement when people try to tell me to do something different.", "NTA but your parents ATA.

So they paid my fee and I went over and fixed the problem.\n\nYou offered them a discount , and they wanted it for free but you refused. Since they could not find anyone they paid you? They are using you. Create a boundary and tell them that either you get paid or you dont go.

Hell no, taking time in that situation to help them cost you money, that's on them. The elitism is kind of gross.", "NTA\n\nCongratulations on getting your own company.\n\nI think your parents value academia above everything else and that is not a way to measure someone's worth or intelligence it just says they are good at remembering things.

What\u2019s good for the gander is good for the goose", "Nope, NTA.", "NTA. The world could use a lot more plumbers and a lot less lawyers.", "NTA", "\n\n>My parents however have decided that they need to push my kids to be successful unlike me.\n\nyou own your own business and on top of that don't have thousands in college debt. sounds like you are plenty successful. your parents just suck.

That is disrespectful.", "NTA but you might as well try to think of ways to be amused/indifferent to your parent\u2019s opinions because they will never change and everyone\u2019s life will be easier if you just let stuff slide.", "NTA! WOW your parents are giant A-HOLES! We need more tradesman.", "ESH, especially your parents. \nFirst off, your brother never should have charged them for work he did on their behalf. That is tacky. Second, it doesn\u2019t seem like you charged them because you need the money. More like you needed the recognition that you are just as valuable and successful as they are. \nThird, becoming a vet tech is a noble position taking care of animals. Being a vet has more prestige and less BS to deal with. Your daughter will be better off investing more in her education. I say this as a nurse practitioner that used to work as a nurse; being a provider is more satisfying emotionally because just like doctors were the purpose of the position is to figure out the puzzle. As a nurse, or as your daughter would be doing as a vet tech, was doing the grunt work so a provider can figure out the puzzle. It doesn\u2019t seem like that is the issue though; it seems like you are upset that your parents present that being a vet tech would not be good enough in their eyes. Fourth, as a daughter of a plumber you are more than enough. My father tells this old story: there were three brothers. One went to Yale, one went to college, when asked why the third brother didn\u2019t go to college he replied \u2018someone had to put them through college\u2019\u201d. A man can earn just as much with out a formal education without accumulating all that debit by developing a trade. Good for you for being smart enough to become a plumber.", "ESH you are being pasaive aggressive OP. Of course you should be paid but that is not the problem here. You are not really communicating how you feel to your parents and thus you are not even addressing the real problem.\n\nInstead of using the fact that they have an emergency to punish them, you can sit with them a regular day and tell them how you feel undervalued bc they are properly compensating your brother for his help while they are taking your time and effort for granted.\n\nAlso tell them that their vision of what \u2018success\u2019 means is not the only one that matters and they should stop manipulating your daughter, bc she has the right to take her own life choices. And tell them that you are a successful man even if they are blind and cannot see it.\n\nOP if you are passive aggressive instead of asserting how you feel they are never going to be held accountable for what they\u2019re doing, and you are never gonna let go of your resentment.
