This almost wrecked the joy of my wedding, but more importantly, it was devastating to my son.  My duty as a mother is to protect my son.  Clearly, a woman who would say these things to a little 7 year old boy, let alone her own grandchild, cannot be trusted in his presence.  I stand by my decision to remove her from the wedding, and to protect my child by cutting off contact.  No apology is forthcoming.  There will be no further discussion.  \n\nBest, OP\"\n\nPost it.  Then go NC with anyone who tries to persuade you to risk your kid, and remain NC with your mother.\n\nGood for Brandon for having your back!  And good for you for finding a career (yes, a career!) that has allowed you to support yourself and your little boy.\n\nNTA!!!", "NTA-Tell all of the assholes who think you should apologize exactly how awful she was to your son. If they\u2019re still on her side then you know who your family really is.", "NTA - post on her post why you ended the relationship.  I'm always a don't be petty but I would do a post of my own.  If they don't support you, good riddance.  Block and move on.  You sound like a good role model for your son.", "NTA. If I were you, I would stay NC with her. You need to protect your son.", "NTA. Your mom sounds like a horrible and miserable person.", "NTA. No matter how complicated being a teen mom was, nobody should be telling a 7 year old that he is a mistake. The end. I don't know what her problem is and I don't care because there is no problem she could have that would justify her hurting your son that way.\n\nDo not let her near your children ever again. Do not let anyone who is defending her near your children. You know what she will do if she gets the chance. Why give her another opportunity?", "NTA- you should never apologize for protecting your son from abuse.\n\nBlock anyone who thinks otherwise .\n\nNever allow your mother near that boy ever again OP.", "NTA; this woman loathes her grandson\u2026bye \ud83d\udc4b", "NTA. \n\nYour son didn't not choose to be born so it is unfair to put that on him. Life happens and plans go awry (wether they are your plans or your moms). \n\nGood on you standing up for your son and showing him the love and support he needs.\n\nGood on your husband supporting you and (hopefully) being the father your son gets to have. \n\nI can hope your family does not know whole story else they would not being siding with her. If they do know the whole story and still side with your mom, you should also not talk to them. \n\nI would not speak to her unless she honestly apologizes, you make it clear that type of crap will not be tolerated, and she needs a mindset change.", "NTA x 1000! You would be wrong if you didn\u2019t go NC after what she did.", "NTA. It was toxic enough she feels that way about an innocent child. She took it to a whole unacceptable level of toxicity when she vocalized that to him. Keep her and anyone who agrees with her blocked. You did nothing wrong and have no reason to apologize. She on the other hand\u2026I wouldn\u2019t even want an apology after that. Ick.", "Please, whatever you do, do not apologize! What I would do is send a message to the entire family, letting them know what she has done. That now that they know what happened, you want them to butt out and let you live your life.\n\nYour son will always come first before your mother, and I am super proud of how you stuck up for him.\n\nKiddos to you!!!\n\nHugs!! Congratulations on your nuptials and on the new addition to your family!\n\nNTA", "NTA - you and your mother may have issues amongst yourselves but taking it out on a young child\u2026there\u2019s not enough words to explain how wrong that is.", "NTA. I think that FB post of hers needs more context and details that you should add. Explain what she screamed at a 7yo. That should stop the flying monkeys that are after you.", "NTA. Did anybody record her tirade? Because if so, you have receipts that would back up your reason for throwing her out. It depends on how scorched earth you want to go. Do you want to show the flying monkeys exactly what she did? Or do you just want to ignore everybody & live your life.", "NTA. She wants to whine about her daughter turning her back on her while also verbally abusing and traumatizing her grandchild?\n\nInsanity!! Stay away from this toxic person", "No. Don't. What she did was awful, cruel, and flat out mean and untrue. NTA", "NTA - jfc your mum sounds exactly like mine. She's the asshole here, like such a huge, ginormous, gaping asshole. Not only did she tell your son he was a mistake *at your fucking wedding*, *and* while your pregnant again, but she based that opinion on the fact you didn't live your life the way *she* wanted you to live it. *Then* she went and unjustly demonised you to anyone who would listen. That's at least 5 asshole moves she's made right there. \n\nPlease don't apologise to her. \n\nI hope you and your kid are OK x", "NTA, Your mom should be the one apologizing. It is rude and extremely unfair of your mom to blame your son over things that are outside of his control. Also your son should only be punished for his own actions not someone else\u2019s, he didn\u2019t even asked to be born that was all you and your husband albeit; accidentally. If your mom wishes that you go to college and thinks being a hairdresser isn\u2019t a real job, then it seems to me that your mom doesn\u2019t exactly know what\u2019s best to you, I mean college is not for everyone and she really shouldn\u2019t be choosing your career path. \n\nSo in a way, it\u2019s HER that\u2019s trying to ruin your life she\u2019s middle aged yet she\u2019s behaving like a controlling brat", "Nta and you should most definitely make sure that everyone understands the entire situation. You might have turned your back on her as a daughter but as a mother you did what was absolutely necessary for your son which is much more important.", "Definitely NTA and I'm proud of you.\n\nDon't back down on this one.", "NTA she is a vile woman and you should tell everyone the horrible crap she said and if they still side with her cut them off as well. What kind of vile trash speaks to a child in such a manner. You did everything right by protecting your son. You did nothing wrong and keeping her away from your family is probably best. Also does she not realize you can go to college at any age? You could go in 10 years if you wanted to, so her logic makes zero sense.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with my mother at all if she treated or spoke to my child like yours does.", "YTA\n\nYour mother is right, hairdresser is not a real job, and if you chose to skip college because of your son, in a way he ruined your life. I get it, you live him because you gave birth to him, but it doesn't matter. College graduates an average earn more than non college graduate so your son certainly ruined your financial future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And to protect your son you need to go no contact with your mother. If you care to give the rest of your family the true story of what happened. Anyone still siding with you mother, go no contact with them as well.", "NTA.\n\nStuff happens.  You have a kid and you love each other.  Your job is a job. \n\nMom is a snob and abusive.

She's out of your life and should stay so, and you'd be on sure ground to talk tough to her flying monkeys so that they regret having called you up to side with a monster.\n\nBut meanwhile--and just among you, your husband, and your son--you might start treating this incident as so ridiculous it's comical. Laugh at her. That way, your son can see it as something not unlike Daffy Duck throwing a tantrum in a cartoon, which would take away all your mother's power to hurt.\n\nAgain, this would be a private joke among yourselves. To others, it's serious, a vile act that cannot be forgiven.", "NTA does your family know what she did, if so, they are AH as well.  If not let them know what she did.  As she verbally attacked your son get an order of protection against her.", "Not your fault.

These choices lead to different opportunities and more choices. Lead your life as you see fit. As long as you are not hurting others, no one else should criticize. \n\nYou had your son and chose a path that has brought you to this point. If you are happy, it was a good choice. Nothing else really matters.\n\nYour mother is too myopic to understand that any other choices, like not having your son, would have taken you to a different place, different experiences and culminating in making you a different person altogether. Rather than be happy for you at this time, she instead attacks a big part of who you are. Good riddance.

Why? This was a unionized employer and I had a pension worth over $10,000.00 that has almost tripled with wise investing.
