The bride removed me for not being supportive enough after I spent almost $1000 and in particular could not make a bachelorette party that her MIL planned with 4 days notice. \n\nHer MIL planned it cause. 1) the bride stopped talking to me after the bridal shower cause the decorations I got \u2018didn\u2019t look like the pictures\u2019 after I purchased directly from links she sent me and got all things I had custom made pre approved by her, 2) the bride worked weekends and I didn\u2019t know which ones she had off, and despite me asking at least once a week for 6 months what good dates are for it, she never told me and  3) I was not able to be there the day before to help set up her bridal shower cause my time off work request was not approved. \n\nthe MIL texts me on a Monday a couple weeks after the bridal shower to see if I could make it to a bachelorette party on Friday. I didn\u2019t know she was off work, and I was out of town for a commitment I\u2019d had for months and wouldn\u2019t be back until the following week. The MIL had picked a spot 25 mins from where I was at, and 2 hours from all of\nOur home. I thought I could rearrange my commitments out of town and have my brother cover me, and told mil so and to tell me more (my brother ended up not being able to, and I found out after I learned about the party from the MIL)\n\nWhen the MIL texted me, I asked the bride to call me cause I didn\u2019t know if she knew, was off work, or if was something she wanted to do, especially because when we were planning what she wanted for her bachelorette party she explicitly told me she didn\u2019t want her MIL to go. \n\nHer MIL wanted me to plan events for the party, buy it was in a place I am not familiar with. Also her MIL wanted to take two cars, and me to drive one. That meant I\u2019d have to go home , then the venue, then drive them back, then go back to where I was even though I was only 25 mins away as opposed to the home\u2019s  2 hours. Also, I would have had to pay for my own parking, gas, ferry ticket + part of the brides, and at least a couple rounds of food and drinks for everyone in a very not cheap place. And, not as important but still annoying, cause I was driving I could not have a drink all day despite being the MOH. Also,we all Easily would have fit in the MIL\u2019s car, and with two cars someone else had to drive anyways, so I\u2019m still not sure why she felt we\u2019d need two cars or asked me, especially when there was  a minor SIL who can\u2019t drink but did have a license. \n\nI tell the MIL that my brother could not cover me and I could not make it work with 4 day notice. The MIL responds nicely.I still haven\u2019t heard from the bride since the bridal shower, and I get a text from her the day after that I\u2019m no longer in her wedding because I\u2019ve not been supportive enough.

You did your best to try and make the bachelorette party and couldn't.\n\nHowever, in your place, I would put an end to this friendship. If the bride hasn't already done so.", "You are NTA. Politely inform your (ex)friend that you are sorry she feels you are unsupportive, however you are currently at a work-related event and while you tried to get someone to cover for you, you were unable to accomplish that with such short notice. That is the unfortunate effect of real life. Also ask her to please reimburse you for any money you have spent (if it hasn't already been reimbursed) now that you are no longer a member of the wedding party. After that has been settled, wish her well for her wedding day and future then cut her off regarding any big or important life events. If she comes to you with a genuine apology about her behavior, then you can reconsider what level of contact you want to have with her going forward. If you have any mutual friends, you may need to go on an information diet with them with regards to her. Basically let them know that you really don't want to hear anything about her life as it is no longer any of your business by her choice (only do this if they try to talk to you about her or something along those lines). This, of course, is only if you cut off contact to any certain degree. This situation sounds partially like a bridezilla case, but more like someone who really isn't a friend to begin with since she didn't seem to be making much effort to communicate with you regarding HER special event, then blaming you for the things that go wrong when they aren't how she likes them.", "[removed]", "NTA. Gosh this whole friendship sounds toxic. Your \u2018friend\u2019 dived epically into bridezilla mode and pretty much set you up to fail.

Wherever or not you want her back is another matter.", "[removed]", "NTA. This made me exhausted just reading it. Consider yourself lucky by being uninvited to what will surely be an insane wedding. You dodged a bullet from this bridezilla and milzilla duo.", "NTA take them to court to get your money back.", "NTA.  You want an unsupportive MOH? My dearest friend\u2019s MOH constantly stood her up.  The wedding was a couple weeks ago, and more than once this year, said MOH was supposed to visit and always had excuses.  They hadn\u2019t seen each other in four years, and MOH kept backing out.  She was supposed to be there five days before the wedding, then had excuses, and showed up so late two nights before that the bride didn\u2019t get to see her until the morning before.  It was hard getting MOH\u2019s measurements for her custom gown (and even then, the list wasn\u2019t complete), hard getting a hold of her for anything.  MOH ended up wanting her dress taken up 1cm the night before the wedding, which would have made me miss the festivities. (Bride ended up telling MOH to not be there instead, and asked me to be, and screw that 1cm.) She did so little that the poor bride had a breakdown after the wedding when the MOH left the event early after being so uninterested in doing a single thing that other people noticed and asked about it.  Sadly, no effort was made, though the bride and everyone else all made every effort to include her.  My heart still hurts for this bride.  As I said, she\u2019s one of my absolute best friends.  Thankfully, this lovely bride found out that some of her friends are even better friends than she knew, three of us who had never met before who banded together to be there for her.\n\nHad her MOH, who may not even be a friend anymore, tried even 10% as much as you did, that would have been such an improvement.\n\nSadly, it sounds like your bride friend is the one like that MOH, who is so uninterested in any work, like nailing down dates, while blaming others for it.  You made an effort.  You could only do so much when someone isn\u2019t responding, and it sucks.  You are absolutely NTA here, and that bride and her mother should be glad that you made the effort as much as you did.", "NTA and OMG it sucks that you put a lot of money into it already, but this is a friendship lost forever.
