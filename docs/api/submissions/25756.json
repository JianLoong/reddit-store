Your father and your AuntStepMom are the worst kinds of villains, and I'm sorry you're dealing with that.  \n\nIt sounds like your mother is also treating you terribly--why is she taking all your money? \n\nYou don't have tonhave a relationship with anyone youndont want to. I do hope at some point tho, you'll feel kinder towards your sister, bc she's also an innocent victim in this--she had less than 0 choice in how this played out.", "NTA. No one is entitled to your money. If you don't want to take her then that's just that. It's unfortunate because it isn't her fault but it's not yours either.", "NTA.\n\nBut why in the world is most of the money that you earn going to your mom?", "NTA- but gently, the situation is not her fault. Would it be impossible to treat her kindly as a sister and/or cousin  without seeming to condone the selfish, homewrecking behavior of both her parents?\n\nThis is your father's mess, and his mistress's, but they deserve to be the ones who suffer for it, not your half-sister/cousin.\n\nCould you at least keep your fun activities with your brothers to your mother's time, so as not to rub it in her face that she is unloved because of her parents' crimes?", "NTA.\n\nBut I am a bid confused. Do you mean you step-sister or your half-sister? You said, that your Dad and AP had a kid together.", "NTA. But stop giving your mother money.", "INFO how does your half-sister feel about all this? Technically it's not her fault that her parents are home wreakers. She's innocent in this.", "NTA however....Next time you want to go somewhere fun, maybe try to include her if they ask you to. It will not hurt anything to include her. with that being said, you can tell your dad that your income is very limited and he and her mother will need to provide \"X\" amount of money to make sure she can do what you and your brothers are doing so she is not left out. You guys may have a good time and enjoy each others company! It will literally not hurt anything to include your sister, as she is innocent in all of this and just trying to fit in with her half-siblings/cousins. HOWEVER, they need to make sure to provide the money for her to come so you are not bank rolling the entire trip for everyone...that can get super expensive and you should not be responsible for everyone!\n\nAlso, please stop giving your mom all of your money! That is YOUR money for you for you to do with as you please. If you feel like you need to help with rent or bills then come up with an agreement to HELP with bills, not give up all of your money. That is excessive to say the least! The fact that you had to ASK your mom to save $400 is absurd when it is YOUR money that you work for. DO NOT let your mom be entitled to YOUR money!! If she is not working, then she needs to be. If she is still struggling then she needs to hit up the kids dad for child support. In no way, shape or form is it YOUR responsibility to take care of your mom or siblings! Please put a stop to that ASAP!", "Info: is she your step sister or your half sister?", "NTA, your dad need to accept he put himself in this situation by cheating, no less with your moms sister, like wtf?", "NTA. Also the sister cousin is not at fault and she will need a lot of therapy to get over that shit but you are 17 and not responsible for her. At 17 it seems like you have enough to deal with without being caretaker to someone else\u2019s baggage. Harsh but true. Also your mum should not be taking your money unless you agreed to it to help her.", "NTA", "NTA she\u2019s the product of adultery. She has a scarlet letter by the sins of the parents.

She didn't ask to be born into this situation. It just happened that way. It is entirely not her fault. OP, please try and find a way to get to know your sister (brothers too( before you pass judgment. At 14, I highly doubt she understands the situation or why you dislike her so much.
