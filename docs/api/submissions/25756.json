Would it be impossible to treat her kindly as a sister and/or cousin  without seeming to condone the selfish, homewrecking behavior of both her parents?\n\nThis is your father's mess, and his mistress's, but they deserve to be the ones who suffer for it, not your half-sister/cousin.\n\nCould you at least keep your fun activities with your brothers to your mother's time, so as not to rub it in her face that she is unloved because of her parents' crimes?", "NTA.\n\nBut I am a bid confused.

Technically it's not her fault that her parents are home wreakers. She's innocent in this.", "NTA however....Next time you want to go somewhere fun, maybe try to include her if they ask you to. It will not hurt anything to include her. with that being said, you can tell your dad that your income is very limited and he and her mother will need to provide \"X\" amount of money to make sure she can do what you and your brothers are doing so she is not left out. You guys may have a good time and enjoy each others company! It will literally not hurt anything to include your sister, as she is innocent in all of this and just trying to fit in with her half-siblings/cousins. HOWEVER, they need to make sure to provide the money for her to come so you are not bank rolling the entire trip for everyone...that can get super expensive and you should not be responsible for everyone!\n\nAlso, please stop giving your mom all of your money! That is YOUR money for you for you to do with as you please. If you feel like you need to help with rent or bills then come up with an agreement to HELP with bills, not give up all of your money. That is excessive to say the least! The fact that you had to ASK your mom to save $400 is absurd when it is YOUR money that you work for. DO NOT let your mom be entitled to YOUR money!! If she is not working, then she needs to be. If she is still struggling then she needs to hit up the kids dad for child support. In no way, shape or form is it YOUR responsibility to take care of your mom or siblings! Please put a stop to that ASAP!", "Info: is she your step sister or your half sister?", "NTA, your dad need to accept he put himself in this situation by cheating, no less with your moms sister, like wtf?", "NTA. Also the sister cousin is not at fault and she will need a lot of therapy to get over that shit but you are 17 and not responsible for her.

She didn't ask to be born into this situation. It just happened that way. It is entirely not her fault. OP, please try and find a way to get to know your sister (brothers too( before you pass judgment. At 14, I highly doubt she understands the situation or why you dislike her so much.

In my family it\u2019s pretty standard for us that if you\u2019re working, you contribute to the household. Though I\u2019d have to ask some of my cousins if this was a problem in their immediate families, but for the ones I was close to and ours, it was just considered regular thing/a point of pride when you were able to contribute to the family bills. Although tbf we don\u2019t come from a culture where that\u2019s seen as a really crazy thing while I know in a lot of Western countries, it\u2019s seen as abuse, so maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing?\n\nEdit: i know the downvotes may still come anyway, but to clarify, it wasn\u2019t really a thing parents asked of us as kids, it was seen as a point of pride and just as a regular thing to start putting money towards the fam, not because of a demand from parents. Times that they did ask though were usually either a very minor \u201ccould you spot me a $10\u201d or like or an actual emergency (like a utility getting cut off). Also it is also not weird in our culture to live with our family as adults. Then it was more structured though and we paid a set amount for rent etc per month.", "The fact that she\u2019s a sister-cousin is more than enough reason for OP to keep her distance.", "Let me guess. You go to church anywhere from one to three times a week and you consider yourself a Christian. This was a terrible thing to say about an innocent child. What happened to \"judge not lest ye be judged\" and the sentiment that God loves all the children? Or, how about the belief that all children are born innocent and it's the world that makes them sinners? I have an idea. How about you throw this out to all the church ladies, while your berating some \"incompetent server\" at your favorite after church brunch venue. I'd pay good money to see that.", "She didn't do anything wrong, and you want a child to be punished for something her parents did?  YTA for your comment.

They\u2019re just making the relationship worse.\n\nIt\u2019s your money you chose who do you want to threat.

She\u2019s your sister. If you want to get technical, your half-sister. I\u2019m so sorry for the craziness you guys have been out through. The adults in your lives sound like hot messes and that is entirely unfair to you kids. That said, none of this is your half-sister\u2019s fault. None of it.

Plus, I bet explaining \u201chalf-sister cousin\u201d when it comes up gets tiresome!\n\nWhile it is true that she didn\u2019t ask to be the living embodiment of \u201cthe crime,\u201d it\u2019s not reasonable to expect a 17 y/o not to see her this way. That kind of thing takes a long time to work out and his brain isn\u2019t even fully formed yet (biological fact; not a comment on OP in any way). \n\nIgnore the biology for a second - if she were a non-biologically related step-sibling I\u2019m betting a lot of folks would be singing a different tune. \n\nI\u2019d like more info on the financials in regard to mom before chiming in about that angle.\n\nIn any case, the issue of \u201cI want to hang out with my little brothers for the day\u201d and \u201ctake your sister too\u201d is clear to me - your money, your choice. Ignoring all of the  other stuff, if you planned it and paid for it it\u2019s an AH move of your dad to try and force the issue.", "NTA- your sister-cousin isn\u2019t at fault, but she is also not your burden. Your dad should have thought of these things before he went and cheated\u2026 with your mom\u2019s sister.", "Yes, but...still not the kid's fault, and kind of hard on her to have to grow up feeling unloved and unwanted because her parents are selfish adulterous sluts cheerfully willing to hurt other people for their own gratification. Plenty of good people have truly rotten parents.\n\nOP isn't an AH for keeping her distance, but I do feel bad for the sister.", "Timeline doesn't add up or OP is holding a grudge over something that happened when he was a toddler and there's no way he remembers his parents together. I think this is an actual stepsister, not the half sister or a product of an affair. With younger brothers, very unlikely she was raised as his sister \n\nAssuming this isn't all fake, of course", "Affair kinda explains the last one"]}
