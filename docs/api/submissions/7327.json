This should not be taken to indicate any current or past employer's position.)\n\nA number of companies are working on self driving tech. I have, and would, get into a number of their vehicles.  Just not Teslas. \n\nMany of the competing companies are at a similar level of technology development. However every other company is either...\n\n1.  manning every vehicle with a highly trained safety driver / monitoring engineer pair who know the system inside out and is trained to avert emergencies, and is extremely focused. They usually take short (like 15 minute) shifts because it's hard to keep that extreme  focus. Or..\n\n2. Operating in a very very severely limited domain (in terms of location, weather, etc..) with 1:1 remote monitoring with a highly trained person monitoring every vehicle and able to intervene in a moment. These people also take short shifts. Or...\n\n3. Operating away from people (I.E. hauling vehicles for mining operations, which do not use public roads and where the mine roads are laid out so no people are permitted on the autonomous hauling routes. \n\nBut tesla does not do any of that. They don't have trained safety drivers, live remote monitoring, or constained operational domains. They don't limit how long a single person can operate the vehicle, despite widely accepted evidence on how focus degrades over time. \n\nThey have similar (or arguably worse) self driving technology to other companies. But while the other 30 or so companies in this space are being responsible for the safety of their vehicles with live monitoring, and trained engineer intervention, Tesla is just letting random consumers take on that role (and liability)\n\nIt's not a good place to be, as a consumer, to be doing the same dangerous job that other people are being paid 6 figures to do. Without training. For free. Hell, worse than free, you're paying to take on a corporation's liability. \n\nThis allows them to avoid paying for some of the usual research and development costs like safety drivers and live monitoring, and it also offloads a lot of liability of testing a very very new and unreliable technology from them as a corporation onto their consumers.\n\nIt also helps them appear \"ahead\" in technology development, while honestly under the hood, I'd say they're behind and simply appearing ahead because they're bypassing safety practices and engineering rigor that other companies are following. \n\nFor example, every time a driver claims FSD or Autopilot error, and Tesla claims driver error, that is a shifting of liability that the other companies in this space would not do. All the other companies take the liability of their technology failing on themselves. \n\nTesla is pushing liability onto the end-user and their insurance policies which are generally unequipped to handle claims regarding AV malfunction, and publicly denying any accusations of malfunction. However other companies developing similar tech are purchasing insurance themselves at very high rates, and being transparent with their insurers about the risks they're undertaking. \n\nI don't see that as ethical, as they're pushing the danger and accident liability onto the consumer, at a very early stage of technology development. I also don't see that as safe for the consumer.\n\nIt's a joke in my field that if you pay for FSD, you're paying to be a crash test dummy...", "Reminds me of airline mechanics.

Even when the human driver \"fleet\" includes drunks and texters and all the other shit people sometimes do. Not Tesla, not my employer, not Waymo, nobody. \n\nHell, even when we give the AVs some advantages over people, like not having them do night-driving driving in bad weather, they still don't hit that human-driver benchmark.\n\nIt is a major unsolved problem in the industry and a major reason that the promise of self driving cars \"soon\" is always a year or two off...

Climbing can be dangerous, and it can be very safe, and it depends on how you approach it.\n\nThe kinds I do are much less dangerous :) I mainly do top-rope climbing with a highly trained group that includes a lot of 'process redundancy' in our rope rigging setup - basically meaning every knot and clip is checked by multiple people and verified again before beginning to climb.   \n\nI've also personally looked into the failure rates of all the equipment my crew relies on, and the component failure rates are literally orders of magnitude lower than some of the components relied on in AV development. \n\nAlso did you adjust for the number of climbing-hours across all climbers? And the number of driving-hours across the vehicle fleet? \n\nIf I were you, I'd calciate a mean-time-between-failure for the major system or process failures associated with rock climbing, and self-driving respectively.\n\nMTBF, post-adjustment for fleet size, is a lottt higher for vehicles, than the similarly-adjusted numbers for climbers..

If your bf invited you to a friend gathering and someone there was acting creepy, and your bf just laughed because \"that's just how they are\" and you decided to leave and he physically stood in front of the door arguing with you that you needed to stay and just accept it, would you be asking if you were the asshole when you started yelling for him to get out of the way?

I can't tell the future, these are just my personal beliefs)\n\nI think it depends on the use case. \n\nThere's a lot of autonomy \"done right\" already!\n\nComputer based train control is an existing autonomous vehicle transport system that has an amazing safety record, and I wish had 1/10th the investment as personal automobile autonomy\n\nThere are several currently feasable and safe uses of autonomous vehicles, for example hauling loads in mining and industrial applications. Generally off of public roads, and in a controlled environment such that human driven vehicles and pedestrians are not allowed in the autonomous haulage lanes. \n\nAs far mixed-mode-operation on public roads, among pedestrians, human driven vehicles, etc... It's an unsolved problem. \n\nIt's been an unsolved problem that's \"2 years\" from being solved for the last 15 years. So I don't know when or if full autonomy, on public roads, in all conditions people drive in (night, rain, snow, etc) will ever be solved, but it sure won't be done completely in 2 years. \n\nIn the US market at least, I think what's more likely is:\n\n5 years out:\n\n- expanding use of autonomy in limited and controlled situations. \n\n- But also increased regulations, as it is currently extremely deregulated in the US market. \n\n- More industry use of AVs in mining, fracking, off-road military, and other non-public-street operation. \n\n- More prototype development, with heavy supervision and heavily limited operational design domain on public roads, likely backlash when safety issues reach the public eye. \n\n10 years out: \n\n- possibility for an AV to perform better than an average human driver in certain constrained conditions (average human driver is a both a low bar, as some of the average population is drunk driving, high, texting, tired, distracted, etc.. but also a high bar, as no AV company has come close yet despite promising this benchmark \"soon\" for 15 years.) \n\n- expanded use of AVs in \"easy\" markets, such as long haul trucking rural SouthWest USA which is generally sunny, dry, flat, and less populated, and has fewer pedestrians\n\n- No consumer vehicle ownership access for the average driver, AV access will be on a subscription-model or rideshare model as companies attempt to recoup r&d costs and turn a profit \n\n- increased use of autonomous vehicles in military applications, hopefully backlash from the public and human rights organizations \n\n20 years out -\n\n-  technology maturing, regulations and technology co-evolving and a better public and regulator understanding of the capabilities and limitations.\n\n- Expanded use of AVs for passenger or trucking applications, though operational conditions will be constarained. \n\n- (If all vehicles and road users were automated and interconnected, this could be accelerated, but this would be deeply inequitable, restricting road access from those who have older cars, walk, cycle, etc. A better solution for a interconnected vehicle network exists, it's trains!)\n\n30 years out \n\n- autonomous vehicles regularly perform better than the average human driver, and their pitfalls and failure modes are thoroughly understood enough to be accommodated for in other ways such as considering the safety of AVs and mixed-use road operations in infrastructure design. \n\n- Best Case: possible direct to consumer autonomy, along with investment into affordable or free autonomous public transportation. At least that's my dream.\n\n- worst case: manufacturers don't release autonomy technology for consumer access, instead staying with a ride share or subscription model, and create a monopoly on safe automated driving, leaving populations without financial access behind for the sake of corporate greed.

So far, NHTSA's investigation hasn't uncovered (or publicized) any evidence that the Autopilot deactivations are nefarious; the intent is a mystery. From where we're sitting, it'd be fairly idiotic to knowingly program Autopilot to throw control back to a driver just before a crash in the hopes that black-box data would absolve Tesla's driver assistance feature of error.
