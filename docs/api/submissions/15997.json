We are now in our mid thirties. We stayed in touch after high school, talked occasionally, and even hung out a few times. To my knowledge, there was never any animosity.\n\nAnyway, my dad and Sara\u2019s mom worked together and are acquaintances, and when my dad bumped into Sara\u2019s mom at the grocery store a few weeks ago, she mentioned she was selling her home soon (the house Sara grew up in.) It is the size we need, in the school district we need. My dad told Sara\u2019s mom we may be interested in taking a look at it before it went on the market so we arranged a date and time.\n\nI excitedly texted Sara to tell her we were seeing her mom tomorrow to look at the house and received replies such as:\n\n\u201cYou're not getting the house so you and your dad can fuck off\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so inappropriate so drop it it\u2019ll never happen\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll burn it down before that happens\u201d\n\u201cThat's so inappropriate to try to buy my childhood home without even talking to me.\u201d\n\nSo I ask, am I the a-hole for not consulting my childhood friend about potentially buying her former home? (Note, neither her nor her brother are interested in buying it as they have their own homes.)\n\n***UPDATE***\nHer mom called off our meeting to see the house. I\u2019m assuming due to Sara completely losing her shit, as she stated in other texts she was \u201cgoing to flip out on her mom\u201d. Sara has struggled with mental health in the past, and has actually spent some time in a mental health institution. Due to the unhinged texts and open threats, it\u2019s probably for the best her mom called off the meeting and that we don\u2019t go through with purchase as we have 3 young children and don\u2019t want to be constantly looking over our shoulder. I\u2019m sure something else will come along so I\u2019m not upset about the house at this point, but I will say the \u201cfriendship\u201d is definitely over.", "created_utc": 1682788882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1331h4e/aita_for_not_asking_my_old_childhood_friend/", "score": 2615, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd bet money that she will never tell her parents she did that so it's unlikely to interfere in your purchase.", "Lol NTA. Where does any self-respecting adult get off from talking to someone like that over an interaction that is nothing to do with them? Needless to say friend is the AH.", "Whoa. NTA. \n\nYou don't need to ask permission. You did let her know you'd be looking at it, in excitement, as a friend - You didn't NEED to notify her. What's her problem?

There is some animosity here and I hope you can update us.  My guess is is between Sara and her mom. NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s an insane response from her.

The house is being sold. Whilst her mom absolutely can decide not to sell it to you, for whatever reason, this is just asshole behaviour from your friend.", "NTA.

Your \"friend\" is.  There is clearly something going on in her family which you not aware of.

She could have been expecting to inherit the house. She could also have been trying to negotiate with her parents to purchase the house herself. Perhaps even the most remote possibility of having to return to her childhood home and seeing it completely different than what her memories are if she were to come visit you makes her unhappy. Regardless, her reaction does seem a bit extreme, especially the burning it down threat. That one alone makes me say you need to show the text to her mother. If she were to choose that option, there is nothing to say that she wouldn\u2019t try to do it even if her parents still have belongings in the house, and her parents don\u2019t deserve to lose any of their belongings to such petty behavior. There is also the possibility that her parents were avoiding telling her they plan to sell until it was a done deal and they are completely moved out (and the new owners moved in), precisely because they knew she would react this way and truly believe she would follow through on the destruction. By waiting, it\u2019s entirely possible that it would have taken the wind out of her sails because then she wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to stop it.", "NTA and I'm wondering if her reacting so crazily is because she assumed that would be part of her inheritance, like her and her siblings each get a stake in the house. Maybe she planned to sell it after her parents passed and split the money equally with the others.", "NTA. \n\nBut I feel like you're leaving some stuff out because Sara's reaction is completely over the top.", "Your friend is absolutely wild for thinking that BS. NTA. Buy that house if you want it.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t consider buying the house at this point. She sounds crazy enough she might really try to burn it down or worse.

You DID just reach out to her.\n\nBut her entire response - imo that\u2019s a reason to completely end a friendship. Her mom is selling the house and she doesn\u2019t want to buy it, so why be upset that someone you consider a *friend* might buy it?\n\nTo the point of saying you\u2019d burn the house down to the ground?\n\nIt\u2019s just strange.\n\nYour childhood friend should have no input on what house you buy or who her mother sells her house to.\n\nLetting her know was imo an appropriate courtesy (because why wouldn\u2019t you tell a friend?) but that\u2019s it. All that lady did was torch whatever friendship was left.\n\nMake an offer on the home, and if you get the house just make sure to change all the locks when you move in.\n\nSara may convince her mom to not accept your offer if you make one, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about that.

This actually happened with two friends of mine, they were close enough where one guy was a groomsman in the other\u2019s wedding.
