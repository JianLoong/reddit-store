We are now in our mid thirties. We stayed in touch after high school, talked occasionally, and even hung out a few times. To my knowledge, there was never any animosity.\n\nAnyway, my dad and Sara\u2019s mom worked together and are acquaintances, and when my dad bumped into Sara\u2019s mom at the grocery store a few weeks ago, she mentioned she was selling her home soon (the house Sara grew up in.) It is the size we need, in the school district we need. My dad told Sara\u2019s mom we may be interested in taking a look at it before it went on the market so we arranged a date and time.\n\nI excitedly texted Sara to tell her we were seeing her mom tomorrow to look at the house and received replies such as:\n\n\u201cYou're not getting the house so you and your dad can fuck off\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s so inappropriate so drop it it\u2019ll never happen\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll burn it down before that happens\u201d\n\u201cThat's so inappropriate to try to buy my childhood home without even talking to me.\u201d\n\nSo I ask, am I the a-hole for not consulting my childhood friend about potentially buying her former home?

She needs to get over herself. Her parents own the house and they decide if you can buy it or not. Show them the text their daughter sent you.", "NTA and I feel like Sara is pissed the house is being sold because she wanted to inherit it.", "  NTA and Sara seems extremely unhinged over this.  She gets no say in who her mother chooses to sell her home to.  Are you paying a fair market price?  If so, I would tell Sara\u2019s mom that Sara seemed upset about you buying the house.  This may be an issue between the 2 of them more than you.", "NTA\n\nDid Sara bury some bodies there or what?", "As soon as you put money down and sign the papers, you need security cameras on that property. Threatening to *burn down the house* rather than let you buy it-even though *she* doesn\u2019t  want it - well that\u2019s just unhinged.\n\nProtect yourself, and make *sure* your home owners insurance is sufficient for a rebuild. \n\nNTA if it\u2019s on the market-you can buy it.", "NTA \n\nAre you sure you and Sara are friends? \nDid she have a bad childhood in the house?\n\nIt\u2019s not your emotional baggage to carry so if you want the house, go for it. Sara had already set fire to your friendship in her response so what is there to lose? \n\nIn saying this, if she\u2019s close with her mum then it\u2019ll be unlikely you get the house so don\u2019t get your hopes up.", "NTA: but save those messages in case there's a problem when you do but the house. I'd bet money that she will never tell her parents she did that so it's unlikely to interfere in your purchase.", "Lol NTA. Where does any self-respecting adult get off from talking to someone like that over an interaction that is nothing to do with them? Needless to say friend is the AH.", "Whoa. NTA. \n\nYou don't need to ask permission. You did let her know you'd be looking at it, in excitement, as a friend - You didn't NEED to notify her. What's her problem? Her reaction seems extreme.", "The house doesn't belong to Sara, it belongs to her parents. They're perfectly at liberty to sell it, to you or anybody else. If she's got a problem with that, she should call them\u2014not you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Show the texts to her mother.", "NTA. \n\nThe house is on the market and it seems Sara\u2019s mum didn\u2019t have any issues with giving your dad details about it or arranging a date.\n\nI would imagine there could be personal issues within the family causing the animosity, but none of that is your fault.\n\nShe sounds like someone whose contact details you should lose swiftly.", "Well, goodness. There is some animosity here and I hope you can update us.  My guess is is between Sara and her mom. NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s an insane response from her. You\u2019re interested in buying a house that\u2019s being sold. Why you\u2019re the bad guy here in her mind is beyond me.", "NTA but you should tell her mother how upset she is about this. Ask the mother why her daughter is behaving unhinged.", "NTA please inform the mom and actual person selling the home..", "Definitely NTA.\n\nThose responses sound strangely similar to the hostile weirdness of my addicted family members...", "NTA. The house is being sold. Whilst her mom absolutely can decide not to sell it to you, for whatever reason, this is just asshole behaviour from your friend.", "NTA. Did she know her mom was planning to sell the house? Some adult children get extremely upset when their parents sell their childhood home.  They assume that their parents will stay right where they left them.", "NTA she sounds unhinged.", "NTA\n\nUnless she buys it, she doesn't get a vote about what happens to a property. \n\nKeep these messages in case you experience vandalism.  She'll be suspect #1.", "INFO/NTA\n\nWe're missing something.\n\nRegardless, don't communicate with Sara again. She's clearly unhinged. Who threatens to burn down their parents' home??\n\nGo ahead and see the house as this is between you and the owners, none of her business. \n\nI wouldn't mention the crazy text to her parents. At least not yet. But definitely save it on the off chance you need it as evidence.\n\nAnd consider this, if that is her reaction, her parents have undoubtedly seen this behavior as well. \n\nBest for everyone to leave her out of this entirely.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" is.  There is clearly something going on in her family which you not aware of. However, given the clear threats in her text, if you end up buying the house,  I would report them to police and take order of protection", "NTA. There are a number of possibilities here. She could have been expecting to inherit the house. She could also have been trying to negotiate with her parents to purchase the house herself. Perhaps even the most remote possibility of having to return to her childhood home and seeing it completely different than what her memories are if she were to come visit you makes her unhappy. Regardless, her reaction does seem a bit extreme, especially the burning it down threat. That one alone makes me say you need to show the text to her mother. If she were to choose that option, there is nothing to say that she wouldn\u2019t try to do it even if her parents still have belongings in the house, and her parents don\u2019t deserve to lose any of their belongings to such petty behavior. There is also the possibility that her parents were avoiding telling her they plan to sell until it was a done deal and they are completely moved out (and the new owners moved in), precisely because they knew she would react this way and truly believe she would follow through on the destruction. By waiting, it\u2019s entirely possible that it would have taken the wind out of her sails because then she wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything to stop it.", "NTA and I'm wondering if her reacting so crazily is because she assumed that would be part of her inheritance, like her and her siblings each get a stake in the house. Maybe she planned to sell it after her parents passed and split the money equally with the others.", "NTA. \n\nBut I feel like you're leaving some stuff out because Sara's reaction is completely over the top.", "Your friend is absolutely wild for thinking that BS. NTA. Buy that house if you want it.", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t consider buying the house at this point. She sounds crazy enough she might really try to burn it down or worse. I personally could never be comfortable living there. I\u2019d find another house and block her.", "NTA but I kinda want a follow up to this one \u2014 especially if you buy the house", "NTA\n\n> \u201cYou're not getting the house so you and your dad can fuck off\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so inappropriate so drop it it\u2019ll never happen\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll burn it down before that happens\u201d \u201cThat's so inappropriate to try to buy my childhood home without even talking to me.\u201d\n\nWhat the\n\nThis is just such a strange response. You DID just reach out to her.\n\nBut her entire response - imo that\u2019s a reason to completely end a friendship. Her mom is selling the house and she doesn\u2019t want to buy it, so why be upset that someone you consider a *friend* might buy it?\n\nTo the point of saying you\u2019d burn the house down to the ground?\n\nIt\u2019s just strange.\n\nYour childhood friend should have no input on what house you buy or who her mother sells her house to.\n\nLetting her know was imo an appropriate courtesy (because why wouldn\u2019t you tell a friend?) but that\u2019s it. All that lady did was torch whatever friendship was left.\n\nMake an offer on the home, and if you get the house just make sure to change all the locks when you move in.\n\nSara may convince her mom to not accept your offer if you make one, but there\u2019s nothing you can do about that. (It would just make Sara the asshole on multiple levels.)", "Wtf NTA and call the cops tell the persons family spread the word about this", "Big NTA, she\u2019s childish and immature. This actually happened with two friends of mine, they were close enough where one guy was a groomsman in the other\u2019s wedding. The groom ended up buying his friend\u2019s childhood home with his wife and to my knowledge there was zero animosity over it, other than the rest of us thinking it was pretty funny. \n\nNow we just give our one friend shit occasionally because his friend bought his parents house but he\u2019s a good sport and also thinks it\u2019s funny. The housing market is tough and it\u2019s odd to get so territorial over that", "That would weird me out a bit to know a friend was buying my childhood home, but I would never be that rude about it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
