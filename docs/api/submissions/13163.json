This seems like a fairly one sided relationship with you doing most of the work.", "NTA, but ... When someone isn't giving you what you want and expects more than you can give, don't bottle it in, let it pass and build resentment, talk to them. You should have told her years ago that you will also have a lot on your plate and will respond when you can, and to stop asking if you are mad. And since she isn't making an effort to meet, don't put yourself to any trouble for her either.  Personally, when I went where she lives to visit family, I would tell her when I have time for her, if she comes, fine, if not, also fine.", "NTA.\n\n\"Are you mad at me?\" ummm.... \"Yes. And here's why...\"", "A relationship is a 2 way street. Leave the door open but don\u2019t expect a visit. When you do visit family let her know, but don\u2019t shortchange family for her. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s moved on which can be normal as you get older, families etc\u2026time for you to move on too. Lower your expectations of her and put you and family 1st.", "Of course not. People grow up, get families, priorities change. It's painful but inevitable. Be friendly on social media, and let her come visit you if she wants to (and don't be mad if she never does). NTA.", "NTA its all one sided  amd it has to be on her  time... focus on yourself and your family... ignore her and whenever you are in her state don't let her know", "Everyone has a different capacity. It's not necessarily a reflection of how they feel about you, but about themselves.\n\nIf you don't want to go visit, you don't have to, but you also have to realize that her going to visit you isn't the same thing, bc you are going home and seeing family and friends. \n\nIt's also pretty normal when you are the person that moved away that you are the person who goes back. It's not fair by some respects but it's also pretty common.\n\nAlso, her coping with a young baby isnt necessarily going as well as it did for you. She may be more overwhelmed at the idea of travelling. \n\nYou can definitely choose to not put the effort inyo visiting but don't make it tit for tat bc friendships aren't transactions. If she's a good friend in other ways then just evolve from there.\n\nNAH", " NTA.  She will probably ask you when you are coming to visit and you need to just respond with a big laugh that it is her turn to come to you.  If she begs off then just say something like \u2026.Aw, we will miss you!   Hope it works out for you to come stay with me at some point!!!

You can go visit her if she ever does, but I would create some distance.
