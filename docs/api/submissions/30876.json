You\u2019ve taken care of her parents, don\u2019t get along with BIL and have no obligation to give him money.", "NTA your wife's brother has nothing to do with it and she has some nerve wanting you to give away money that's not hers especially to a person like her brother.", "You owe nothing you've earned to your extended family but you graciously chose to share the fruits of your labor with them; making a gift to your BiLs kids is beyond generous.\n\nBuy your BiL a lottery ticket, wish him luck and be done with it. \n\nNTA", "NTA It's your money to do what you want to with it.", "NTA, you don't owe him anything. You can do with your money what you want and give it to the people you feel deserve it or have meaning to you.", "NTA. Not only is it your money, it has roots in your family, not yours.

Protecting your assets from BIL is also looking out for them.\n\nWhen my grandfather was writing his will (after having significant financial success from hard work and wise investing), he was very clear that my grandmother should have limited access to money if he died first. He provided generously for her but knew that she would be bled dry by her deadbeat brothers if it was allowed. She was furious. Everyone else understood, and we were grateful for gradndad looking out for all of us. \n\nSo, from someone who was impacted by the kind of decision you're making now: you're NTA, and you're acting wisely to look out for the future of your wife and kids, if any.", "NTA. He doesn't deserve anything. It's your family money to do with as you please.", "NTA. He isn't your brother. Had no relationship to your father.", "NTA \n\nThey arent entitled to your money regardless of the amount.", "NTA  Tell wife the money would be better going to BIL's children since BIL is a dead beat who refuses to even pay child support for his own children. Is BIL the one behind your wife asking for the money for him?", "NTA \nYour wife is delusional. It\u2019s from YOUR dads business. That fact that you paid off her parents home is very nice but not owed.", "NTA - He seems like a real piece of work, especially what he is doing to his wife and children, not to mention mooching off his parents (unless he is paying them rent and/or bills for them). I really like the idea of gifting the money to his children by putting it in a trust for them. Doesn't seem like he is doing much for them himself other than being a parent every other weekend. Besides, you owe him nothing and I think its very generous of you to think of your MIL and FIL as well as your BIL's children, you did not have to but you did/are and your wife should be accepting of that.", "Your wife has a hell of a nerve, to say her brother should get some of your money. Why should he? You were extremely generous to help her parents, but her brother mooches off his parents and doesn't even want to take care of his own kids. \n\nThat is not a man you should give money to.\n\nNTA.", "INFO: did your wife ever own any part of or contribute to the business?", "YTA but I'm not saying that because you should give the brother money, because really he sounds like a bit of a dick. \n\nI'm saying it because that money you received from the business that you grew so successfully is as much your wife's as it is yours. You've been together 18 years and I'm confident she must have contributed to your success one way or another. If you split up now I imagine she'd get half of it anyway.\n\nSo, with that said, shouldn't your wife be able to give some of the money to her brother if she wants to?

Yes I guess you two are married, which makes assets joint, but I don\u2019t get this.\n\nI think  that because it\u2019s an inheritance is not joint but maybe you made it joint.  Maybe this is also a sideways way of her saying \u201cI wish you had consulted me on how you were spending this money instead of just doing it\u201d and \u201cgive my brother money\u201d is her way of feeling control in the situation.\n\nMaybe try getting into the why or therapy.", "Ask how much shes given her brother without telling him", "No.  \nDon\u2019t do that.  \nThe AH would probably win.", "OP seems pretty smart about finances.
