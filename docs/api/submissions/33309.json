No one should be forced to eat food just because someone brings it in. I have been on both sides of this.  If this coworker is the unproblematic type, you may just want to tell her \"Thanks so much for bringing in food today. Sorry I didn't partake, but I am on a strict diet with my trainer for the time being. I'm sure it was great!\"  Hopefully that will make her feel better, since she took it so personally.", ">I am such a pickle eater\n\nI too am a pickle eater. I especially love the spicy ones from the specialty super market. \n\nAs for your decision not to eat her food that does not make you an asshole. It's hard to say if your coworker is an asshole. Some people cry easily and try to keep it private. Without more information, NAH.", "NTA\n\nIt's offensive in some parts of the world to reject hospitality, but here in the West you're under no obligation to eat anyone's food, only under an obligation to be polite about it when you decline.\n\nIf you simply said \"I very much appreciate the offer, but I brought my own lunch today. Thanks though.\" then you're off the hook. You don't owe co-workers an explanation for your pickle based diet.", "NTA - people have to calm down about bringing food to work. Maybe I once saw you not wash your hands. Maybe I have a food issue and I don't want you in that business. Maybe your food looks gross.  \n\nMaybe you are a cat lady with 1,000 cats! What do I know!  \n\nMy old boss made it clear he never ate anyone's food made from home. Never did. He told me it was because he was always afraid of getting food poisining or just eating gross stuff. He was also sad because some dishes truly looked delicious! But he had to either eat everyone's food or no ones. So he just ate no ones.", "NTA. That\u2019s not a normal or reasonable response on her part. So weird.", "NTA. You probably could have let her know that you are on a strict diet, but for her to break down in tears over it s perplexing. Maybe she was crying over other stuff going on in her life and for whatever reason this situation just pushed her over the edge.", "NTA, you are on a diet and her food didn't line up with said diet. You didn't make her cry, she chose to cry. You are right in that being absurd behavior. She's going to have to get used to not pleasing everyone sooner or later, it may as well be now.", "NTA \n\nI understand why your coworker might feel upset, but to shed tears over it is patently ridiculous. You DID NOT make her cry, unless you said something rude like \u201cEwww no!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m trying to eat healthy.\u201d She chose to cry. \n\nYou are never obligated to eat or even sample food that someone brings to the office to share. Allergies, sensitivities, preferences, diets (by choice or by necessity) \u2014 it doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t matter why. The following should be enough: \u201cThank you for the offer, but I am following a meal plan and must decline.\u201d That moves the asshole ball into the coworker\u2019s court.", "Absolutely NTA. Food pushing is not okay anytime, anywhere. What if you were allergic to what the coworker brought in? Would it be forced upon you then just because coworker was \u201ctrying to do something nice\u201d and it put you into anaphylactic shock? Nobody would expect that. \n\nIf you choosing to eat healthy with what you brought is the best way to take care of yourself for the time being you should 100% do that without guilt.", "NTA... but why don't you talk to her directly about it? It's an easy conversation to have. \"Oh man, I would love to try your food. It smells and looks delicious! Unfortunately I am on a very strict diet with my personal trainer for my health, so you understand that while I'm jealous of everyone getting to try your food, I have to maintain my best health and make my own food. I hear everyone loved it though, what do you like to cook usually?\"\n\nSay the reason and then introduce a new topic so she doesn't think it's up for debate. Crying is a bit of an overreaction, but some people react strongly if their love language is rejected. If she asks what your restrictions are, say there's so many that other office folks wouldn't get to enjoy her cooking if she tried to abide by them. \"No reason to ruin a good meal for everyone else!\"", "NTA. I would just tell her that you have some personal dietary requirements that stopped you from eating her food. And she asks what they are, just say it\u2019s personal.", "NTA anyone who cries at their food not being eaten is either in a very bad personal place, or way too sensitive and has never learned adult coping mechanisms.", "NTA although perhaps you could have explained why you didn't want the food.", "NTA, I'm a horrible picky eater. I will literally gag and/or throw up if I eat something and find out it has onions or ranch dressing in it. As such, unless I know literally every ingredient down to the spices of something someone else cooked, I won't even try it so as to not embarrass myself and them. When people give me crap for it, I will remind them that I will get sick if I eat it. She very much overreacted. People have food aversions, allergies, religious rules, and preferences, and it's not her place to others to get over them magically. Her being so upset that she cried isn't on you, and sounds like she needs some therapy.", "Info: She told you she was thinking about it and you didn't communicate anything then? I feel like there's backstory here. Is it normal for people to bring in food for the entire office? Do you usually partake if they do?", "NAH\n\nyour food-preparing coworker has a crush on you", "Soft YTA.\n\nSomeone went out of their way to do something nice for you, and you ignored them.\n\nThe proper response would have been to tell them \"Thank you, I appreciate it, but I'm actually on a fairly strict diet right now.  Paying a personal trainer and everything.  It looks delicious, and is probably way better than what I've got, but I gotta stick to this, sorry!\"\n\nYou're not the asshole for not eating it, but you're a soft asshole for how you handled the situation in general.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The coworker crying because one person didn't fawn over her unannounced food? That's not normal. You do not owe this woman an apology nor did you have to sample her food.  She's far too sensitive and needs to be able to deal. You're right. It's absurd behavior on her part.", "Good lord, people are super sensitive about the strangest things.  She was crying because you ate the lunch you made yourself, because wait, you didn\u2019t want to waste what you brought, right? So instead of her asking you why you didn\u2019t eat her food, she goes off and starts crying? Look, I\u2019m a sensitive person but that\u2019s just BS.", "NTA. She may have a thing for you, so I would have been more gentle, but you're definitely not the asshole. Crying because a coworker didn't eat the meal you brought to share is a sign of an emotionally unstable person. I will never understand why people take it so personally when you respectfully decline an offer of food. I have a million issues (allergies, aversions, the works) and feel pressured all the time to eat something or do a food centered activity. I just respectfully say no thank you and firmer when necessary, as some people simply refuse to understand. That's on them. How you handle it is on you and it seems like you did fine.", "Geez. NTA\n\nPeople really need to not take personally that which isn't personal.", "how dare you not eat food someone else made and brought in when you had your own food from home. don't you know you have to eat anything from work that people provide? you made her cry, for shame\n\nall sarcastic, BTW. NTA. you had food and are not obligated to eat anything. what a drama queen to cry about that. ignore and enjoy your food. BTW, pickels are delicious!", "NTA. This is a huge pet peeve of mine. Compromising on food can be hard, even when you\u2019re doing it with the people in your home. For many of us, lunch is the only meal we get to 100% choose for ourselves and I really dislike when coworkers get pressure-y about lunch!", "NAH\n\nEmotions are difficult to control. You are by no means TA for not eating the food, but as someone with plenty of mental struggles, I can understand why something so inconsequential may feel like a huge thing and be a tipping point causing tears. It doesn't sound like she is harassing you about it, so I think that she may just, likely for unrelated reasons. Just to keep office peace, I'd suggest saying something like \"Hey, your food looked great, but I'm on a strict diet, so that's why I didn't eat any.\"", "You didn\u2019t make her cry.  She decided to cry and make a scene because you ate the lunch you brought- which is stupid and childish.  NTA", "NTA \u2014 some people have very restrictive diets and or preferences. \n\nIt\u2019s your choice as to what you eat. Your coworker needs to dial back their insecurities a bit. You\u2019re not responsible for their misconceptions.", "NTA. I don't eat any homemade food that coworkers bring in. I don't know their kitchen hygiene practices. Did they slap raw chicken on the same cutting board they used for the food they brought in? Did they wash their hands? Did they drop food on the floor and put it back in the pot?\n\nBut mostly for this reason: At a previous job I had a batshit crazy coworker who used to bring in cakes and cookies that she baked herself for everyone - in fairness they looked really great, and were apparently delicious. My coworkers used to tease me about not partaking. But something told me not to eat them. To cut to the chase she was fired in spectacular fashion, and on the way out the door she turned and said \"By the way I peed in all those cakes I brought in.\" Whether or not that was true, we'll never know.", "NTA.  You shouldn't feel forced to eat anything.", "NTA\n\nIf your co-worker has some big feels about your not eating their food, it's on her to manage those feels.  Not you.", "NTA. Pay attention here. YOU DID NOT MAKE HER CRY. She made herself cry. And for a stupid reason. And what she did is a form of bullying. She offered. You are allowed to say no without having to fear about repercussions. My guess is she cries all the time. Over stupid things. Best  thing to do is ignore it.", "NTA - I have severe food allergies. Even if you swear up, down, and sideways your food doesn\u2019t have any of my allergens in it, I\u2019m still not touching it. I don\u2019t know your kitchen or your cleanliness so I can\u2019t be sure of any cross-contamination. Due to this, I\u2019m not touching it. You can turn on the waterworks and be all butt hurt but, I care more about staying alive, or at least out of the hospital, than I do your feelings.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You are not required to eat her food and she\u2019s being quite overdramatic about the whole thing. As long as you weren\u2019t rude about not  eating her food then you are in the clear.", "NTA. As a picky eater with texture issues, sensitivities and allergies, I have often brought my own lunch to work when someone is bringing in food. There's no guarantee that I can eat it. I used to work somewhere that we did annual inventory counts. They ordered in dinner. I always brought my own just in case I couldn't eat what they ordered. \n\nYou're on a diet set out by your trainer. Again, no guarantees that what they made is within the bounds.", "It's not a gift if it's forced.", "You should not even need to have to tell them you are on a strict diet, you don\u2019t need a reason to not eat someone else\u2019s food. You made your own lunch and that\u2019s what you wanted to eat. NTA.", "Tbh I was the most confused with this. This is what made feel like an asshole. I would never go out of my way to make someone cry and to hear that someone cried because I didn\u2019t eat their food made me feel like an asshole. Tbh I ended up crying a little in work because I felt like a huge asshole", "Whoops! I definitely do not eat pickles either!", "Grillo's FTW", "Your comment, reminds me of when I went to a coworker\u2019s house for Christmas dinner.  There were 10 of us from work and a few of us were helping her with some final prep.  As we are getting ready to start bringing out the starter soup I walk into her kitchen where I see her cat licking from the soup tureen.  When it sees me it jumps away from the tureen and goes straight for the turkey.  And starts licking it.  I was completely caught by surprise.  Tell our host, \u201chey your cat is in the kitchen licking stuff.\u201d  She says to me, \u201coh, she does that all the time.\u201d  Yuck.  I only ate the salad from the fridge that meal.

After a crying tantrum, I would stay 10 feet away from that person.\n\nNot a safe person to have in the work bubble. \n\nWhy should OP have to coddle coworker?\n\n I don't trust home hygiene standards of others.  It's okay to eat or not to eat.  \n\nDid she lace them with something? That reaction is odd at best.", "You are definitely not an AH just because you didn't eat food someone else brought in. Especially when she never communicated when this would happen.  Makes no sense that she fixated on this when other people ate her food. What a drama queen - I wouldn't even want her food after this performance lol", "Don\u2019t take it personal. When stuff like this happens to me, I just give them the benefit of the doubt and assume they\u2019re in some new meds that are making their emotions a little wack-a-doo.", "Downvoted because how can you not eat pickles??", "NTA, I have a restricted diet for medical reasons, I would've brought my own lunch in as I always do and eaten that as well because I couldn't be sure I was able to eat it or not.", "NTA\n\nWTF? She's crying?", "You have freedom to choose what you put into your mouth. Let her cry. It has nothing to do with you. NTA.", "Unless I\u2019ve seen the inside of your house I\u2019m not eating the food you bring. I\u2019ve read too many horror stories on here about potluck food to scar me for life. The nicest, seemly cleanest people can be the dirtiest. No one should ever be forced to eat something they don\u2019t want to, periodt.", "What if you didn't like it?  Her problem not yours.  \n\nI had a co worker who used to bring in sweet deserts or treats weekly.   I do not have a sweet tooth, I don't like sweet food, I dont eat sweet food, I actually dry retch at the smell of overly sweet food.  She would always find a way to make it seem like I had offended her.  I literally finally had to talk to the boss about it.", "NTA and you didn't make her cry, her personality did.

Or not. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, whatever is going on in her life that she\u2019s crying over this, isn\u2019t something you likely have any power to fix.", "Shit you don\u2019t know what her kitchen looks like if she has cats on her stove if she washes her hands etc. I don\u2019t eat other people\u2019s food at work. I don\u2019t have to. And her crying her crocodile tears because you didn\u2019t partake is a giant red flag! You never said you would nor are you obligated to do so.

I'm always seeing videos with cats on the kitchen counters. I am allergic to pet dander. How do I know there isn't any in the food? And how many times did you lick your fingers while preparing the dish?", "Is your coworker 12 years old?", "You did not \"make her cry\" as you did nothing to her. Bringing food in for people is nice but you can't expect they'll all eat it, can't even expect they'll all like it.", "Is it possible this coworker has a crush on you? That could explain a bit of an over the top reaction and the hurt feelings.", "Does she perhaps have a crush on you? If i was hoping a man loved my meal id be internally a lil sad lol crying is excessive and weird tho. NTA."]}
