I waited like half an hour but it just did not pass and I was so dizzy and felt like I could pass out. I stopped at the nearest fast food place and crammed some food in my face hoping that would help but it didn't. Scariest drive home ever, I was going like 25 in a 50 because too fast and it was worse. If we had a second car I would have called my husband to get me. There is also no public transport.
