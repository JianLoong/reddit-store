A prank is a joke involving a loved one and must be something everyone will appreciate to be anything other than what this was - vicious bullying. A prank among friends and loved ones brings people together because it is reciprocated joking.

They're going to shave his eyebrows off if he's not careful.", "I also agree the response was disproportionate (and ESH), but filming the \"prank\" strongly suggests that there was a social humiliation component intended (like, sharing the video on social media).  That does make this more than \"make-up on [his] face.\"  I'd have grounded all three for the full 2 weeks, or longer, personally.", "I think I\u2019m in agreement here. Reading the story at first cut I was very much like \u2018smashing the phone is a massive overreaction\u2019, and it was, however that kind of swift escalation is a super common response to bullying - which is what OP\u2019s steps are doing. \n\nAt the same time, property damage is a much bigger deal than putting makeup on someone\u2019s face and filming it (presumably to show others and compound the bullying) (Edit: on the face of it, and from the parents\u2019 perspectives only!) and parents would have to punish that strictly, which can lead to the instigators of the bullying receiving a lesser punishment and the bullied kid feeling like they have to go big because they\u2019re getting ganged up on and the parents aren\u2019t stopping the bullying.  It\u2019s pretty isolating when your bullies are living with you, because you don\u2019t even have the ability to go home for a safe space. \n\nOP you need to have a conversation with your parent about how being picked on and ganged up on at home feels and if possible, like if your other parent is around/living with them is a possibility or you have grandparents, do seriously talk about going to live with them if the bullying doesn\u2019t stop.", "> This was deliberate humiliation for the purpose of oztracizing and hurting you.\n\nI agree with this, especially with the internet, videos like these could last forever.\n\nThough it's wrong to destroy someone's property, I feel like the step siblings are always ganging up on OP and this is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Perfect timing too for the prank, considering their parents were out of the house.", "Why film it if they had no intention of sharing it with their friends and family to make a fool of OP? They invaded his privacy and adults don\u2019t play these mean spirited tricks. They fucked around and found out.", "Yea I agree with this one. Makeup while sleeping is about as mild as mild gets and frankly I think two weeks for intentionally breaking a phone is way short.", "Idiotically drastic consequences are different. Makeup can get washed off, but OP is gonna lose a lot of money paying for her next phone, and is definitely TA.", "Not really up to some kid to determine the consequences. He\u2019ll probably be paying for the new phone which helps, but he escalated way too much.", "It\u2019s about maturity, which OP lacks. Just because someone wronged you doesn\u2019t mean you need to escalate further, express yourself without a temper tantrum that\u2019ll break someone\u2019s phone.", "Typical Reddit dire situations to trivial problems. Nothing is getting worse it\u2019s a stupid argument where OP was an AH and escalated too far. They should stay with their parents and figure out how to pay for the new phone.", "I guess the cold shoulder and yelled at him?  He would have never done it himself if his sister didnt tell him to tag along", "Back in the day nobody was filming the pranking so that it could live forever on the internet.", "If it were just the makeup I would agree with you. Makeup washes off but the internet is forever. They were filming this to post it and hold him up to ridicule.", "Do not talk about squidward like that", "So is filming someone without their consent.", "Me and my stepsister are both 16 and my stepbrother is 14", "Since OP shares a room with the stepbrother, I assume they are male.", "It's more than makeup here. First of all, it's not feeling safe to sleep in your home. Second,  if it is being recorded,  it's a sure bet that it will be shared on social media.  These have serious ramifications.  Too many times people are cruel,  then claim it was only a prank. More often than not, the pranksters think it's fun. The pranked suffer.", "So then ground him for a week like the others and have him pay the parents back for the phone by doing chores or something. Pranks are one thing but taking videos of it brings it to a different level.", "I mean, yeah possibly, but it\u2019s also pretty common to see a bullied kid escalate way above what is reasonable because the teenaged brain doesn\u2019t perceive threat rationally, particularly when they feel trapped/cornered. Being ganged up on and targeted at home by step siblings when the parents are out would pretty easily put a teen into that mindset. Therefore to me if this prank was part of a sustained campaign of bullying then it\u2019s still an ESH, but it\u2019s also a \u2018this kids parent needs to protect them better and not leave them home alone with the steps if this is a thing\u2019. Video taping the prank is intent to humiliate beyond the actual act. \n\nBlending families with kids is really really hard, and sometimes, it results in the parent having brought their kids\u2019 bullies into the home. And kids do need a safe space where they can be away from their bullies, so yes, if this is part of a pattern of behaviour and not just a single incident, OP should be talking to his parent about what options he has to escape bullying, which may include going to live with other relatives if he/she won\u2019t/can\u2019t ensure their kid isn\u2019t bullied at home.", "Fair. Squidward is a curmudgeon on the surface.\n\nBut he definitely would break SpongeBob's shell phone for such a minor transgression so...there's that. lol", "Ah. Didn't catch that. I'll edit.", "I may get hate for this but I feel like breaking people's possessions when you're  mad is a path towards being a wall puncher, they shouldn't have pranked you, but you're still responsible for your behavior.", "ESH I totally would be humiliated if that was done to me so I understand!  I probably would have been so mad as to break the phone right away.  You did the right thing by deleting the video but if you stopped there you wouldn't have gotten in trouble. \nYou had time to cool down. \n\nYoung are the least ah of every one!  Parents suck for making your punishment longer than step kids.  Also, for raising you in an environment where it's not safe for you to sleep.

U need therapy.", "YTA.\n\nRetaliation needs to be at the same scale as the initial offense.\n\nYou basically dropped a nuke on a medieval peasant.\n\nNot cool. You need to pay for repairs or replace their phone", "YTA for breaking her phone. You deleted the video and that should have been it but you let your anger control your actions. Was it nice what they did? No. Did your stepsister deserve to have her phone broken because of it? No. Btw, what did you do to punish your stepbrother? He was the one putting the makeup on you.", "NTA. The people saying \"property damage is over the line\" are wild to me. Sneaking into your room to humiliate you and record it, probably for the internet, is way worse than getting your phone broken for being an asshole.

Pranks for views are even more bs.", "NTA bullies should have the tools they use to bully and harass others removed from their possession. If she didn't want anything to happen to her phone she shouldn't have been using it to give you a hard time because she finds it entertaining to be cruel and nasty to others.", "NTA.  Both of them will think twice before pulling a stunt like that again.  Too many stupid \u201cpranks\u201d go unpunished, and a phone is hardly difficult to replace.  If I was the father, I\u2019d give her a flip phone until she earned enough money to replace it herself.", "NTA.\nPranks are not funny and if you are not part of the \"game\" then it's not a fun or funny, it's harrassment.\nAs the memes all seem to say, too many people behave like they have the right to do what they want with no repercussions.", "You know what? NTA. They fucked around and found out.", "NTA. If I were your mother, I'd be taking your sister's phone away for bullying you, so you would've just saved me a step. It only costs your parents money if they replace her phone, and in their shoes, I wouldn't. This subculture of recording yourself humiliating or scaring other people for social media hits is morally bankrupt.", "You were only grounded for 2 weeks? I would have taken your phone away for at least a year because if you can\u2019t respect someone else\u2019s phone, why should you be trusted with your own.

I would have grounded you for a month and banned you from all electronics for 3 months or more.\n\nYTA\n\nYou can set boundaries with your siblings without destroying property.", "NTA: if your going to prank people you should expect retaliation. But I think breaking the phone is a little overboard. \n\nI\u2019ve seen so many jerks prank innocent bystanders just trying to go about their days I have no sympathy for prankers.", "NTA. Regardless of how simple the prank was touching someone without their permission is a violation.", "NTA. But, wear the grounding with the pride. And don\u2019t say \u201cdon\u2019t fuck with me\u201d. Cause that\u2019s basically a dare for people and makes you look weak. And is an opening for them to laugh at you. \n\nYou proved to them with an action (destroying the phone) that you\u2019ll react to their games in ways they can\u2019t laugh at. And by taking the punishment without argument, they\u2019ll realize that you\u2019re willing to deal with some form of punishment if it means getting your point across. This means they will be less likely to do pranks in the future. \n\nAlso, destroying her phone costs your parents money, unfortunately. And while her recording you justifies you destroying her phone. It\u2019s not her who has to pay for it but your parents. Now she gets a new phone. So try not to react as you did in this post in the future.", "ESH but tbh I don't fully blame you because this sort of sounds like a straw breaking the camels back; you bother the angry primate your shit gets gronk spiked", "ESH but it also sounds like there are some dynamics here that make you feel very unsafe. I do not agree with smashing a phone out of anger, but I understand and see the anger that drove you to that behaviour.  It sounds like you\u2019re outnumbered and that\u2019s plays into a lot of other areas in your life with your step siblings. Your parents are handing out punishment without really looking at the base root of the reaction. The dynamics of a mixed family (steps) can be really difficult for all involved.

But it\u2019s up to the parents to decide consequences (maybe they\u2019d have taken away the stepsister\u2019s phone, which would have been an appropriate punishment). OP had an overly aggressive reaction when it wasn\u2019t even up to them to dole out consequences for the stepsiblings\u2019 prank. I didn\u2019t say victims need to be the bigger person either, but reactions that are so drastically out of proportion aren\u2019t any more okay than the \u201cprank\u201d and can lead to retaliation, and it can become a vicious cycle.", "Bro\u2026 it\u2019s makeup. Get over it. My sisters used to sit on me and put make up on me and call me Brianna.", "I think you just need to get off the internet more and make friends. Pranks are definitely not always posted on social media and most of the time that I\u2019ve seen these things recorded they\u2019re kept to the same phone it was recorded on. It\u2019s just because you always see pranks online but that\u2019s really not how people are in the real world.", "So does smashing someone\u2019s phone lol. And you can\u2019t pay back a phone through chores there\u2019s a pretty big pay discrepancy there. Regardless I guess he\u2019ll find the money.", "Yes\u2026 He\u2019s a kid - he made a mistake.", "And now the parents are out the price of a phone 1k or so.  Because their jackass kid had to make other idiot kids 'find out\n\nMaybe I'm biased but thats a lot of money", ">OP cannot sadly fall asleep in his own home.\n\nThis. This is what stands out to me. The more I think about it, the more I'm on the NTA side. \n\nMaybe OP should pay for a replacement phone (it might not be an iPhone; there are lots of cheaper phones). The real consequences should be that now the stepsiblings have to share a room and OP should get a room to himself *with a locking door*. If they're going to gang up on him, at least let him defend himself while sleeping. The parents are the worst AHs here for not taking this seriously.\n\nThe idea of someone attacking me in my sleep and filming it in an obvious attempt to humiliate me would make it really difficult to get a good night's sleep. And that has real health consequences.", "He can't cause he share the room with stepbro.", "oh no, my family is pretty normal I guess lol, ive never felt like \"stressed out\" when at my mom's house you know?", "please send your address and leave a key under the mat tonight!", "He gave a message doing what he does.. I think that 2 weeks of grounding worth the message\n\n\"Do not mess with me\" this clear message that it's not only words, it's action.. now the step siblings will think twice before trying to do anything like this again...", "Removing the video just gets you back to where you were it doesnt make up for thr fun at your expense nor the willingness to invade soeone's space while they slept And disregard for the sibling.\n\nThey get away scott free from him sleeping peacrfully. Na u fuck around you find out.\n\nI woulda wooped my bro for doing shit.", "Well, aburnicle21, we know who the Golden Child was in your family...", "I am wondering if you are the type to prank or bully people by how you are playing down this sort of bullying. Bullying with stuff like this and endlessly having to deal with people who saw the video is vicious. If I were him, I wouldn't care that I was grounded two weeks, it would be worth it, so they knew not to ever try this again. Two weeks is fair for his reaction.", "He was asleep. You don\u2019t prank sleeping people or mess with food, animals, small children or anyone/anything that could reasonably traumatize someone. A prank should be funny to everyone involved. I grew up in the 90\u2019s when it was normal to freeze bras at slumber parties and draw on people\u2019s faces with sharpies. That shit wasn\u2019t cool in retrospect. He broke a phone. Actions have consequences. Don\u2019t violate someone\u2019s peace when they\u2019re sleeping.", ">so it's fully gone and for this specific situation it won't get posted. \n\n**This time**. OP prevented a next time.", "Just because u didnt break my phone doesnt mean i wont break yours u must be the step siblings", "But it DOES mean they should! And now they know....\"and knowing is half the battle!\"", "Nope. He was asleep, vulnerable, with no ability to defend himself or remove himself. No o e gets to put their hands on you without permission. Not okay. Massive violation in his home. In his BED. Nope nope nope. You\u2019re under reacting to how violating this stuff is.", "Dude, if you'd had a non reaction like, \"this isn't my colour\" and deleted the video then you would have completely taken the wind from their sails. They were looking for a big reaction and they got it. \n\nI was a substitute teacher and my last name has a penis euphemism in it. I could get all ragey and tell the kids not to dare fuck with my name, but that has worked zero times [Source: elementary school and high school] Instead I provide them with a list of ways to make fun of it. Makes it much less fun for the little darlings and I don't have problems.\n\nBreaking the phone has made you the unstable one. I would bet money they will do things to get you to explode now. You'll get in trouble for overreacting, not them.", "Read my other responses to this.", "Sure, but kids are assholes. Maybe it isn't the fun answer but he should have deleted and made them take the punishment. Parents would probably taken the phone away. Now the parents are probably out 1k. If they aren't rich, and even if they were, that's fucked up to do to the parents.", "This is terrible advice. He should have deleted it, told his parents, then they get punished and he's free.", "Yeah, agreed. This wasn't just a fun thing that was funny to them. It was going on Instagram, full stop.", "The parents don't have to buy the girl another phone", "Then the parents should teach their two punk-ass kids not to bully the other one.", "The phone was being used as the object to victimize him. He took the weapon and destroyed it. I would have been pissed if I was asleep in my bed, and someone touched me because you can't put makeup own without contact. Who knows what other things the 2 of them have done to OP? There might be so much more to this whole 'family' dynamic.", "ok. so the alternative is that they recorded it so that they could watch themselves violate and humiliate him over and over?", "Sure you can. Vacuum, mow the lawn, trim the hedges, weed wack, snow blow, shovel, dust, toilets etc. I own a home and I\u2019ve got plenty of chores I could have someone do that over time would pay off the debt. I doubt his 16 year old  stepsister is paying for it. The parents are. Ground them equally and have him do chores to pay it off or have him pay it off when he gets his first job (which he should be eligible for since he\u2019s 16). You also can\u2019t scrub the internet clean if he didn\u2019t wake up and they did post the video. Just bc he stopped them before they posted it doesn\u2019t make it okay. He didn\u2019t hit her, he didn\u2019t throw it at her, he broke it.", "The only mistake he made was not getting his own room with multiple locks, the guy is constantly being bullied every day by the steps to the point he break something of theirs to get them to stop. The parents clearly aren't doing anything about it and most likely never will, so he's taking matters into his own hands as a pissed off victim to prevent the event to repeat itself, the steps are lucky he didn't get violent with them like so many victims of this kind of situation get.", "I mean they could get her a second hand phone or something. It might be cheaper. Plus not something fancy like an iPhone or the latest model.", "And you should take a long walk off a short pier.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "How is any of that relevent to my comment", "So much faith in the fair and equal treatment of children in blended families.", "There's no indication of that tho", "> It was going on Instagram, full stop.\n\nSource: I made it up", "It\u2019s true, they don\u2019t, but in todays day and age a 16 year old not having a phone is a huge pain for parents to deal with, and will greatly inconvenience them for her to not have one. \n\nI\u2019d say get her an old flip phone with no camera \ud83d\ude08", "Then they should have stopped the bullying earlier tbh", "They should, especially since the dynamic of trying to blend an only child into an established sibling unit of steps is always going to be tough. His parent may be oblivious/head in the sand/trying not to make waves so as not to rock the boat with their spouse, but they need a wake up call.\n\nOP was at a disadvantage because step sis got to tell her story first, and they were likely not in any state to be able to express how they were feeling rationally. Hence, needs to speak to his parent alone, express what is truly going on, and if parent can\u2019t/won\u2019t help them/put a stop to it, then they need to start looking at either getting a lock so they can at least have their room to themselves as their space, not be left home alone with said steps, or look into alternate living arrangements if neither of those things can be done.", "Really? Don't you think you're reading into the situation a bit? Somehow \"ive told them in the past to not fuck with me\" turned into \"the guy is constantly being bullied every day.\" And where did \"The parents clearly aren't doing anything about it and most likely never will\" come from, exactly? \n\nThis honestly sounds like an easily irritable teenager with anger problems WAY overreacting to annoying siblings.", "Okay but thats besides the point.  Jackass kid had to make their siblings 'find out' by destroying hundreds to thousands of dollars of property.\n\nAgain, if the parents are struggling they should be fucking pissed", "it'll be just makeup tho. wash it off and grow a pair?", "It\u2019s because they started it and messed with him when he was sleeping. Anyone who does stuff to sleeping people without consent and records it deserves the more severe punishment. It\u2019s an indictment of their character and a precursor to some dark shit. Breaking the phone is just a normal teenage reaction to being awoken to bullying and cyber harassment.", "But how is a person minding their business an asshole compared to pulling the prank THEN dishing out consequence.\nAnd you all day $100s for a phone why does the sibling deserve new one. Used phone glip phones.\n\nTo me this is actions=consequences you blame a teen asking to not be bothered for his being bothered and put $>his feelings like???\n\nIf i smash your tv is it ok if its not your car.\n\nOr cutting your hair itll grow back?\n\nMy point is that a kid was messed with, whole sleeping, after warning them, he removed embarrising photos taken without permission and wrnt confronted hid stepdiblings only wanted het object she used to take the embarradsing photos vids without apology so he smashed it\nYall put a phone ovet wellbeing when she dont even deserve 1 as far as WE know.", "You're having to try to explain it so much because your reasoning is in the wrong, and people are pointing it out, then you double-down.\n\nNot complicated, my dude. You are wrong. Take the L.", "How is it not?\n\nETA you think kids will find life fun without a phone and being grounded? Pretty sure not", "They still got grounded. You think he would have if he hadn't broke the phone?", "This is the right solution", "Absolutely. However, parents often go into blended families with step siblings with rose coloured glasses on, and they love their new spouse so of course the kids have to get along. And that they will eventually, they just have to \u2018learn to get along\u2019 /s.Their divorced/widowed/been a single parent for so long, and then they\u2019re in love, married, they\u2019re happy. Acknowledging the kids don\u2019t get along/can\u2019t be left alone together etc ruins the happy glow of them finally being happy. And that\u2019s hard to deal with. People tend to prefer to avoid hard things. It\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s failing their first duty as a parent to their children, but it happens every day. \n\nHence why OP needs to sit down with his parent, lay it all out, and make it clear that they will find alternate living arrangements if their parent can\u2019t even guarantee them safety from being ganged up on and bullied in their darn bed.", "Because I'm talking how about the logic of \"don't tell them to stop, they'll just continue to assert dominance\" is stupid and you're talking about what op should've done in this spesfic case. \n\n\n> ETA you think kids will find life fun without a phone and being grounded? Pretty sure not.\n\nWth are you talking about", "Nobody said he shouldn't tell them to stop. And I was talking about the bullying siblings.", ">  Just as a little FYI from someone many times your age - telling people not to fuck with you is an excellent way to assure they will fuck with you. \n\nThat what the comment I was replying to said. Are you sure you're in the right thread?"]}
