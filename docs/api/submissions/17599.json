I hate pranks and can understand why you were pissed, but smashing her phone seems like a huge overreaction.", "ESH.  \n\nJust as a little FYI from someone many times your age - telling people not to fuck with you is an excellent way to assure they will fuck with you.  \n\nYou\u2019ve basically issued a dare by saying that - if they *don\u2019t* do something, they\u2019re acknowledging that you intimidate them.  Nobody likes that, hence you get this sort of fuckery just because they have to prove they\u2019re not scared of you, when if you hadn\u2019t said any such thing they might have just ignored you.  \n\nSo now they did their thing, and you had to escalate it because you said you would and you can\u2019t back down now, and - what next?  This is the basic plot of more than one tragedy.", "ESH.\n\nTwo wrongs don't make a right.\n\nYour reaction was also not proportional. You got make-up on your face. They got an expensive personal item broken.\n\nFlip the situation the other way around. Let's say you \"prank\" me by scaring me in the dark, when you know I don't like it. I respond by grabbing your XBox and throwing it out the window.\n\nWould that be fair to you?\n\n**Be grateful your parents aren't making you pay for a new phone!**", "ESH\n\nThey suck for the prank.\n\nYou had the right to ensure the videos were deleted\u2026.but you went too far by breaking the phone.", "ESH, with explanation. You were wrong to smash the phone; you gotta get that under control. My temper used to get me into trouble, so I know how it can feel to want to strike back, but it will only get you grief to lose control. \n\nThe stepsibs are much worse. A prank is a joke involving a loved one and must be something everyone will appreciate to be anything other than what this was - vicious bullying. A prank among friends and loved ones brings people together because it is reciprocated joking. This was deliberate humiliation for the purpose of ostracizing and hurting you. \n\nThe parents have tolerated and fostered this bullying by not coming down hard on the sibs. Giving each of them half the punishment you got is unconscionable. They are even bigger AHs than the sibs, if only because they are old enough to see this for the abusive environment it is.\n\nDo you have a place to go, like another parent or grandparents ' house? I would not say this if the adults were taking the bullying seriously, but clearly they do not", "YTA. Makeup can be easily washed off, you shattered their physical property. Telling them off for pranking you and deleting the video was fine, but you went _way_ too far. \n\n>My stepbrother has told me im acting like a child \n\nHe's right", "ESH.  Without knowing the full history it is hard to comment, but if it was bad enough maybe being an AH is what it takes to be taken seriously.  It is a nuclear option, so the history would have to be pretty bad to justify it.  \n\nYour comment about him pranking his friends is perfect.", "Don't prank unless your ready to deal with the consequences nta", "Unpopular opinion I know, but NTA. They messed with fire", "NTA I don\u2019t blame you a bit.", "Yta. They crossed a line and probably shouldn\u2019t have messed with you, but there are far more mature responses than breaking her phone, especially considering that you already deleted it. Maybe next time try telling her to screw off instead.", "ESH. Especially parents because they allow this kind of bullying inside the family. They actually ruin it into pieces - I wouldn't feel all these inconsiderate and cruel people my family.", "ESH, but you definitely are more assholish because you did not need to break the phone. The video was already deleted. Just because you told them in the past 'not to fuck with you' doesn't give you the right to break property.", "Yta go to anger management", "ESH but they started it. I am afraid you're going to have to watch out now, they'll probably want to get back at you.", "ESH", "Nope. Bullying is bullying regardless of age. If they have been warned and boundaries set then its only fair that they learn the consequences.", "Nta. They were warned.", "nta, tell your parents that youll do it again unless they teach the stepchildren not to piss u off", "NTA.  I think the punishments should be reversed, at a minimum.  You don't deserve punishment but boy the steps do! Your step sis does not deserve a phone if this is how she uses it. I would love to give your parents a piece of my mind!\n\nI don't find this type of prank funny at all.  they are cruel.  What were they going to do with the video?  Dollars to donuts it was going to be posted on social media, which would be humiliating.\n\nFeel free to let your parents read my comment.  Who the hell takes the side of an inanimate object over the very real and legitimate feelings of their son?", "NTA They are bullies and you put them in their place. Hopefully they won't fuck with you anymore. I hate bullies. Your parents are idiots.  \n\nIs there anyone you can stay with? Other parent? Grandparents? Uncles/aunts?  The situation will only get worse.", "NTA.  But what punishment did you give step brother?", "ESH.\n\nWas your stepsister even the one who paid for the phone? And how old are all of you? Either way you shouldn't break people's stuff no matter how annoying they're being.", "Yes, makeup does wash off, but the Internet is forever. NTA. Are the parents okay with bullying?", "NTA\nYou \u201cpranked\u201d her back. People need to stop these stupid \u201cpranks\u201d and if they must do them, they need to live with what\u2019s coming to them.", "YTA for taking it waaaaay too far. As kids we used to do this with toothpaste instead of makeup, it's a prank that doesn't cost anyone money or puts anyone in danger. What you did in retaliation was to break something of considerable value, which is completely disproportionate.\n\nI'm surprised you haven't been made to buy your step-sis a replacement phone.", "Yta.  You went too far", "YTA. \n\nMakeup washes off. You're not acting like a child. He's acting like a child. You're acting like a curmudgeon. A Squidward.", "YTA for sure.\n\nSiblings will piss each other off, yes. But you breaking her phone was only a brief and mild inconvenience for her.\n\nHowever, it's an immediate financial burden on your parents. You're punishing them for your siblings being shitty.\n\nPrank them back or something next time,  do some sibling shit.\n\n*edit: I'm actually afraid for telling you to prank them back if you saw this as \"getting even.\" So never mind that part, lmao", "YTA id have gone with everyone sucks but you straight destroyed her phone maliciously. They were acting inappropriately and immature which is likely appropriate-ish for how old you sound, but you just went above and beyond when you should\u2019ve deleted the video and given the phone to your adults.", "NTA \n\nIt really sucks that you can\u2019t have peace in your own room.\n\nWhat do your parents usually do when you complain but don\u2019t retaliate?", "Yta- it was a dumb joke but you took it to a level of domestic violence. Smashing her things is abusive.", "Yeah, kinda.", "YTA. Your stepsibling are AHs for pulling that bs on you. You should have taken it up with your parents and let them punish your stepsiblings. YTA for destroying the phone because electronics are expensive, and your parents have to pay to replace or fix the phone that's why your punishment is longer.", "YTA and incredibly immature.  Hoping when your parents get your SS her new phone they take the money from the allowance money they give you so you'll at least learn something.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Everyone is wrong here and overreaction or not I think all of you should\u2019ve been grounded for two weeks. Yes you broke a phone but their actions contributed to it. Without the attempted prank you wouldn\u2019t have broken her phone. You all should be receiving the same punishment imo.", "ESH but I wonder if they'll ever want to prank you again now that you've stood up for yourself lol", "NTA\n\nScrew them and your parents, how is it that you got 2 weeks and them 1 week? Very unfair. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to put makeup on. Entirely other thing to film it. What else are they filming of you?", "She had a pretty bad reaction, but I'm giving her a bonus point just for using the term Gronk spike.\n\nEdit: Should be him instead of her.", "Right? They're going to shave his eyebrows off if he's not careful.", "I also agree the response was disproportionate (and ESH), but filming the \"prank\" strongly suggests that there was a social humiliation component intended (like, sharing the video on social media).  That does make this more than \"make-up on [his] face.\"  I'd have grounded all three for the full 2 weeks, or longer, personally.", "I think I\u2019m in agreement here. Reading the story at first cut I was very much like \u2018smashing the phone is a massive overreaction\u2019, and it was, however that kind of swift escalation is a super common response to bullying - which is what OP\u2019s steps are doing. \n\nAt the same time, property damage is a much bigger deal than putting makeup on someone\u2019s face and filming it (presumably to show others and compound the bullying), and parents would have to punish that strictly, which can lead to the instigators of the bullying receiving a lesser punishment and the bullied kid feeling like they have to go big because they\u2019re getting ganged up on and the parents aren\u2019t stopping the bullying.  It\u2019s pretty isolating when your bullies are living with you, because you don\u2019t even have the ability to go home for a safe space. \n\nOP you need to have a conversation with your parent about how being picked on and ganged up on at home feels and if possible, like if your other parent is around/living with them is a possibility or you have grandparents, do seriously talk about going to live with them if the bullying doesn\u2019t stop.", "> This was deliberate humiliation for the purpose of oatracizing and hurting you.\n\nI agree with this, especially with the internet, videos like these could last forever.\n\nThough it's wrong to destroy someone's property, I feel like the step siblings are always ganging up on OP and this is just the straw that broke the camel's back. Perfect timing too for the prank, considering their parents were out of the house.", "Why film it if they had no intention of sharing it with their friends and family to make a fool of OP? They invaded his privacy and adults don\u2019t play these mean spirited tricks. They fucked around and found out.", "Yea I agree with this one. Makeup while sleeping is about as mild as mild gets and frankly I think two weeks for intentionally breaking a phone is way short.", "Idiotically drastic consequences are different. Makeup can get washed off, but OP is gonna lose a lot of money paying for her next phone, and is definitely TA.", "Not really up to some kid to determine the consequences. He\u2019ll probably be paying for the new phone which helps, but he escalated way too much.", "It\u2019s about maturity, which OP lacks. Just because someone wronged you doesn\u2019t mean you need to escalate further, express yourself without a temper tantrum that\u2019ll break someone\u2019s phone.", "Typical Reddit dire situations to trivial problems. Nothing is getting worse it\u2019s a stupid argument where OP was an AH and escalated too far. They should stay with their parents and figure out how to pay for the new phone.", "I guess the cold shoulder and yelled at him?  He would have never done it himself if his sister didnt tell him to tag along", "Back in the day nobody was filming the pranking so that it could live forever on the internet.", "If it were just the makeup I would agree with you. Makeup washes off but the internet is forever. They were filming this to post it and hold him up to ridicule.", "Do not talk about squidward like that", "So is filming someone without their consent.", "Me and my stepsister are both 16 and my stepbrother is 14", "Since OP shares a room with the stepbrother, I assume they are male.", "It's more than makeup here. First of all, it's not feeling safe to sleep in your home. Second,  if it is being recorded,  it's a sure bet that it will be shared on social media.  These have serious ramifications.  Too many times people are cruel,  then claim it was only a prank. More often than not, the pranksters think it's fun. The pranked suffer.", "So then ground him for a week like the others and have him pay the parents back for the phone by doing chores or something. Pranks are one thing but taking videos of it brings it to a different level.", "I mean, yeah possibly, but it\u2019s also pretty common to see a bullied kid escalate way above what is reasonable because the teenaged brain doesn\u2019t perceive threat rationally, particularly when they feel trapped/cornered. Being ganged up on and targeted at home by step siblings when the parents are out would pretty easily put a teen into that mindset. Therefore to me if this prank was part of a sustained campaign of bullying then it\u2019s still an ESH, but it\u2019s also a \u2018this kids parent needs to protect them better and not leave them home alone with the steps if this is a thing\u2019. Video taping the prank is intent to humiliate beyond the actual act. \n\nBlending families with kids is really really hard, and sometimes, it results in the parent having brought their kids\u2019 bullies into the home. And kids do need a safe space where they can be away from their bullies, so yes, if this is part of a pattern of behaviour and not just a single incident, OP should be talking to his parent about what options he has to escape bullying, which may include going to live with other relatives if he/she won\u2019t/can\u2019t ensure their kid isn\u2019t bullied at home.", "Fair. Squidward is a curmudgeon on the surface.\n\nBut he definitely would break SpongeBob's shell phone for such a minor transgression so...there's that. lol", "Ah. Didn't catch that. I'll edit."]}
