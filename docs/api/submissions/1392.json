I (F22) and my best friend (F21) have been attached to the hip for more than ten years, so many that I can't help to feel a bit jealous now that she's got a boyfriend. It's not her first hookup with guys but it's her first serious relationship and I often feel like she's emotionally unavailable to me bc all her energies are put in this new situation she's living. I always envied her a bit because she's skinnier and prettier and also more easy going than me but i love her like one of my sisters and i consider her somewhat of my platonic soulmate and it hurts so much to see her going on with her life while i'm stuck in a life i don't like (which is totally my fault, i know). i feel extremely guilty because, while i try as much as i can, i come off very embarassed and slightly cold when she wants to disclose things about her and the boyfriend, so lately she felt discouraged to talk to me about it and i totally get it. i miss what we had and i want to be a good friend for her, but i don't know how to relate to this new situation.

It is your issue to resolve, just let her know you're trying to work on it and you recognize it. Work on making more friends, maybe talk to a therapist about how to move forward.
