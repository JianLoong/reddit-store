This makes me a possible asshole as she is family and most people love spending time with the kids. I feel like I am young and responsibility free and I dont want to be tied down with her kids, she also chose to have three kids and didn\u2019t first run it by us if we would be willing or ok to babysit. I work full time and enjoy my peaceful life.

Not your monkeys, not your circus. YOu need to sit down and figure out what you're willing to do and not and then have a conversation with her. Tell her you love her kids, but you didn't sign up to be a regular babysitter and she needs to find one who isn't you. Figure out how often you want to take the kids and that you're happy to take them suddenly but you need her to be okay with you if you can't. That you're afraid to hurt her feelings and you want to have that close relationship with her and the kids, but you need to feel independent and able to live your own life.", "NTA why should be responsible for your sister choice ? She wanted kids, now she can take care of them. You did ot want kid so no. She can ask someone who already has kids it will be more logical. It s not because you don't have kids that you don't have a life. You don't owe her anything and she is not a single mother she can pay a nany or ask her husband.", "NTA but you need to just tell her that.

You\u2019ve got three choices here. \n\nRoll over and sacrifice your limited off time to watch your sister\u2019s kids for free. \n\nCharge her to watch the kids. Say $1000 + $200 activity fee per kid per day with a minimum prepay in cash of 5 days. \n\nLastly, say \u201cNo. I\u2019m not available to watch your kids for you at those times.\u201d And then say no more. Your only response is \u201cNo.\u201d \n\nYou deserve to have your own life and that doesn\u2019t have to include dealing with *any* of your siblings\u2019 children unless you want to.", "As someone with two kids under 4, NTA. My sister lives nearby and is also a (mostly,  long story) childfree  teacher. My wife and I both work non teacher gigs.  We often ask my sister to babysit but always emphasize that it is not an obligation,  we completely support her saying no,  we limit how often we ask,  and we make sure she gets compensated with baked goods and other favors.\n\nYou shouldn't have to feel guilty or lie about having plans.  Having an aunty to babysit is a privledge, not a right. They should be cherished and respected,  not shamed and bullied.", "NTA. Every now and then is fine, but expecting you to be the babysitter all the time just because you don't have any kids is stinking rude; your time and peace of mind isn't automatically worth less just because you don't have children. She needs to either work it out with her husband and actually parent, or stop being cheap and hire a babysitter.", "Nta they are taking advantage of you. She makes snarky comments start ignoring them. She does it because she knows how to push your buttons. Start saying im unavailable without explanation. They can pay a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nThey are clearly well off enough to pay for child care.  They can either pay you to do it or pay someone else.  There is no obligation on you to look after their kids.", "NTA her lack of planning isn\u2019t your responsibility.\n\nShe\u2019s accepting shifts before making childcare arrangements for them, that\u2019s on her.\n\nAuntie role doesn\u2019t mean you have a drop of responsibility here.\n\nPush back, tell her she needs to find a reliable babysitter because you\u2019re unable to do it. \n\nYour mental health and your recharge is paramount!  If you\u2019re burnt out down the track because you\u2019ve not looked after yourself first, she\u2019s not likely to do anything to help you out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had 8 weeks to cover of paid full week childcare for 3 children. You factor it in over the year, take cheaper holidays , buy second hand clothes and keep your old car. .. and money isn\u2019t even an issue for OP\u2019s sister!
