She also diminished your time with family as \"getting drunk in a bar\", then took a shot at how your family time isn't as important as hers because you're not a mother, then proceeded to gossip about you, because you stood your ground. She's the asshole, and entitled at that. Don't feel the least bit bad. Depending where you work I think this is a decent HR complaint too. \n\nIt's so incredibly tiring to hear about entitled parents who think because a person doesn't have children that somehow their lives are less important and need to take a backseat. Reminds me of the post the other day about the mother who flipped out on a girl ahead in line at a donut shop who wouldn't give her daughter the last coconut donut. Bad parents pull that card whenever it's convenient. Stand your ground now, or she and every other person at your workplace will keep doing this to you.", "NTA. You planned ahead. As a mom, unfortunately we have to miss things for work sometimes. Plays we usually know of in advance. Definitely not a year in advance, but enough to plan ahead if we have to. I\u2019m sure she is disappointed, but this isn\u2019t your problem to fix.", "NTA. If she's so concerned about parents spending time with their kids, what about your mom's right to spend time with her daughter on her daughter's 21st birthday? \n\nYou are not responsible for your co-worker's failure to plan ahead the way you did. Your plans are no less important than hers just because you're not a parent.", "NTA - you did what you were supposed to do, and have the days off as a result.  You were very gracious to offer her one of your other days instead, and she's being ugly about it.  I'm certain you aren't the ONLY one she can trade with.  If she continues to talk about you and this situation, maybe consider talking to your manager or HR about it.", "NTA. \n\nYou requested the days off and were approved. Your plans are your plans, even if they were \"sleeping in\" or \"getting drunk at a bar\".  It doesn't matter if you're sitting outside of work and eat a burger, it's your plans. \n\nShe can ask, you can deny, and that's the end of that. \n\nIf she keeps up with that passive aggressive shit, you can flip the script on her. \n\n\"I'm my mom's kid, if you were a good parent, you'd understand\" \n\nOr \"you're not childless, you wouldn't understand\".   Or to REALLY get her goat, \"you don't have free time, so you wouldn't understand\". \n\nDon't do that, it's just going to lead to more animosity and is just my childish side coming out. \n\n\nThe point is that you have plans and that's that.  HER kids and plans are not YOUR problem. \n\n>  telling people about the situation and calling me selfish\n\nThe funny part is that you have plans and SHE is being selfish by demanding that you change your personal life around for HER plans. \n\nAlso, if she talks TO them, she will also talk ABOUT them when at some point they don't cater to her whims. \n\nBy having an attitude, she is guaranteeing that nobody will ever switch with her or do her any favors.", "NTA. You planned ahead and got your time off. She also 3 chances to see this show, she doesn\u2019t need to go the first night, you only have the one opportunity to make your 21st birthday plans.\n\n\nJust because she has kids doesn\u2019t make her more important or special than other people. I say that as a parent.", "Nta\n\nShe wants special treatment because of her kids, yet somehow *you're* the selfish entitled one...", "Nta.  Enjoy your birthday!  Her kids and her schedule are not your problem.  You were nicer than I would have been in offering another evening, but she's entitled and thinks the world owes her.", "NTA. You planned ahead. \n\n>I don\u2019t know what to do at this point\n\nDo nothing. If other people feel so bad for her, they can cover her shift. You made a perfectly reasonable offer that she turned down.", "NTA, keep your time off and she can find hers- or! omg, god forbid, go another night as you\u2019ve already been gracious enough to offer", "NTA\n\nYou already offered more than I would have offered. You took the time off. Keep the time off. She\u2019s only making herself look bad. \n\nAnd don\u2019t give up one if your days. She wouldn\u2019t appreciate it anyway.", "NTA, simply because it would not matter at all what reason you asked for the time off. You requested, your company granted. If your coworker had better planning skills, they'd have already gotten the time off.", "NTA similar stories have been posted to this sub before and it's always NTA.", "NTA, her plans are not more important than yours. Have a great birthday!", "NTA, and having children does not trump any other person. You have plans, you followed work protocol and asked off, you received approval, and now you go enjoy yourself. This woman is a toxic coworker and you should sit down with your supervisor or HR. What she is doing is harassment and creating an uncomfortable work environment for you. If you other coworkers care so much let them cover for her and if they ask you about it, that should be your suggestion to them.\n\nHappy 21st! Go forth and celebrate guilt free. Your coworkers problem is not your baggage to carry.", "I mean\u2026I think you\u2019re NTA. Your 21st is special! You should get to enjoy it the way you want to! And, if you\u2019re in the states, no, it\u2019s not just \u201cgetting drunk in a bar.\u201d It\u2019s your very first time! That\u2019s exciting! And you put in for this time SOOO long ago. If you want to switch a day for this woman, that would be an extremely kind of you. But, let that be /your/ decision. Don\u2019t let her guilt you. It\u2019s a special time, and you planned it out meticulously. The coworker\u2019s situation sucks, but\u2026don\u2019t assume any guilt from her. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA.  You made arrangements for days off well in advance. There is no reason for you to switch. And I am speaking as a mother of two which doesn't give me special privilege or more wisdom than you. Honestly, how is her kids play any different than your moms gig?", "NTA\n\nYou planned well in advance for your time off.  It doesn't matter if your only plans are to sit around in your underwear and scratch your ass all day; you still are under no obligation to swap days off with her.  The fact that she chose to reproduce doesn't give her more of a right to that time when she waited until the last minute.  She had to have known more than a week in advance that one of her sex trophies had a performance that weekend, so why didn't she start making arrangements before now?  Because she just assumed that being a parent gives her the right to make other people give up their days off for her?", "NTA. Your mom has kids too, and she'd like to be with them on their 21st birthday.", "NTA \n\nYou requested it off and was approved.  You offered the second or third day so she could see the play. She refused. It's on her.", "NTA not only would i no longer  offer the switch. I would completely stop talking to her at that point and if the talking behind your back continued would maybe consider alterting the supervisor to the harassment.", "NTA\n\nDon't let her guilt you into getting her way, which is what she is attempting.\n\nHer plans are no more important than yours, you just planned better and got the night off.", "NTA.
