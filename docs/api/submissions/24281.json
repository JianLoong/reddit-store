Emily messaged to say Ava can't eat most the food on the list and sent me an edited version swapping out ingredients for things Ava can eat.\r  \n\r  \nThe swaps made the shopping way more expensive, and others replied their kids won't eat most the things on the list and wanted to stick to the original one. I told Emily that this wasn't in our budget, and told her to separately get food for Ava, and we will adjust splitting the food bill to just include her and her husband instead.

Better to get used to it while she's young. NTA.", "NTA\n\nEmily is conditioning her daughter to have everyone abide to her meals which is setting her up for failure and having unrealistic expectations. Emily should meal prep her stuff.", "NTA. Her kid has special requirements, that\u2019s on her. She can foot the bill to accommodate her kids needs. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around Ava, and Emily needs to learn that.", "She\u2019s setting her kid up for unrealistic life expectations if she expects everyone to adhere to the same diet as her child. That is not reasonable at all. She\u2019s her mother and can prepare her own food.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe burden of Ava's allergies falls on her parents. That reality might not be puppies and rainbows but dems the shakes. Stick by your original list. Ava's parents will have to accommodate their own child out of their own pockets.", "NTA\n\nYou are planning group outing and one person's demand can ruin everyone's enjoyment.  \n\nIf the affected person's parent want to participate then she should be the one to prepare special food to accommodate her allergic daughter separate from the food budget of group.", "Yeah, NTA.   Unless she has such severe allergies that cross contact is going to cause issues than there\u2019s no reason to change the menu for everyone.   It sucks to have a restrictive diet, but that\u2019s going to be her life.   (And I say this as a person with an extremely restrictive diet). \nAs long as her mom knows the menu and can make sure she has available alternatives she should be fine.   If some foods can be made safe with limited substitutions than great, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d appreciate the effort, but her daughter\u2019s dietary restrictions are not your responsibility.", "NTA.  If a child requires a special diet, then it is up to the parents to provide.  Also, it is not fair to make the whole group eat something they do not like for the sake of one person.  She is only 5 but as she grows up she will quickly find out that the world does not revolve around her allergies.", "NTA, I\u2019m deathly allergic to shrimp and I always encourage people who aren\u2019t to eat it when I\u2019m with them. Hell I\u2019d love to eat shrimp too, I still remember how they tasted before I developed it. No reason to keep my friends away from pleasure.", "NTA. When you or your family have special dietary requirements. The done thing is to bring your own food.", "NTA \n\nYou're planning a trip for an entire group not just one child. I understand that your friend doesn't want her daughter to feel left out, but she cannot expect everyone to cater to Ava over their own kids.\n\nI think it's fair that you offered to split the cost of groceries to buy specialty items for Ava. Her parent's should be more flexible instead of trying to guilt everyone into imposing their kid's food restrictions onto the entire group.", "This is a tricky one, but NTA if they know their daughter has allergies they can't expect you to pay for all the food and then only eat what she does etc. I would never expect anyone to pay for my food -I also have many allergies- and then ask them to only eat what I eat. \n\nIs there a way you can make the meals look similar so it doesn't look like she's being left out? Or twice a week eat the same meal she does?", "NTA. Ava's mom can make Ava's food, and pay for it.", "NTA - such is life with food allergies.", "NTA. Emily and her husband can shop for their family and all of them eat the same thing so that Ava isn't the sole person eating something different. \n\nGreat teachable opportunity to help Ava understand the entire world won't bend to the needs of the one, and learn to adapt to that. She's just a little one, so it would be kind to have at least one or two meals where everyone eats the same thing, however expecting everyone to eat that way the entire time is unreasonable.", "NTA - and quite honestly, it\u2019s better than you not try to accommodate her. The reason being that you aren\u2019t as educated on how to properly shop or cook for someone with a serious food allergy, and you could easily buy the wrong ingredients or cross-contaminate a group meal on accident. \n\nDid you know that most salad dressing contains gluten? Or that many gluten free foods contain nuts? Or that some soft drinks contain grapefruit even when there\u2019s nothing on the packaging that says grapefruit? Etc. Its impossible to teach yourself a lifetime of caution in the span of one shopping trip. It\u2019s safer and less stressful for everyone if they handle this on their own.", "NTA", "Nta her kid needs special food and she should learn now that she cannot eat what everyone else does sue to her health issues. It doesn\u2019t have to be a big thing, even her parents can eat the same food as her to be nice but it shouldn\u2019t be on everyone to up their food bill to make her feel included. She\u2019s 5.", "NAH. Ava should get used to having to provide herself with safe meals in group situations. That being said, a compromise would be good here: accommodate her needs for one meal of the three each day (i.e. lunch), and have her parents be responsible for her other two meals. That way, she can be included as much as possible, but you and the rest of the group don't have to put up with such a restricted diet the whole time.\n\nOf course, it's a whole different story if her allergies are airborne...", "NTA Somebody else is food allergies are not your responsibility. Not cooking. Not shopping. Nothing. She has a mother and it\u2019s her responsibility.", "NTA. Ava is going to spend her life eating different food then others. It\u2019s not cruel it\u2019s just reality. That being said maybe 1 meal everyone could eat could go a long way in making everyone feel better?", "Well, this trip is going to be a disaster.\n\nESH except Ava", "NTA. You can't all be expected to take on a higher food bill for one child.", "NTA. That's how allergies are, learning now is easier than being an adult and being absolutely ridiculous when she throws a fit because she's eating something different.( I'm literally about to eat a separate meal from my family because I will get absolutely sick)\n\n Maybe eating a shared meal or 2 or a sidelights or snacks or something but that is crazy.", "Info\n\nWhat are the allergies?  Is she asking for no allergies in the vacation house at all?", "NTA  I'll bet it doesn't bother Ava half as much as it bothers her mother. I doubt being on vacation with all of her friends her focus will be on her food - stick to the original menu. If Emily has a problem with it let her know you'll miss her.", "INFO: What are these swaps that would make it so that you and others won't eat what Ava eats for 10 days? \n\nHonestly I am leaning towards ESH. Mostly due to the incredible risk of cross-contamination in a shared kitchen.", "INFO: what\u2019s she allergic to?", "NTA. \"Reasonable accommodation\" doesn't mean changing the entire week's menu for a group of 10-20 people to spare a 5 year old's sensitivities. I feel for Emily trying to look out for her kid, but this is not the way to do it.\n\nWhat does Emily think Ava's experiences are going to be like going forward in life? Everywhere she goes, school, college, work, social functions, there will be people eating things that she can't. A prudent, forward-looking parent would start trying to educate (at an age-appropriate level) their child on foods that are safe or unsafe to eat, because young kids do dumb shit, and there isn't always going to be a knowledgeable adult around to intervene.", "NTA. You suggested a perfectly reasonable compromise. As for Ava feeling left out over not being able to eat what others are having, that's the sad reality of living with food allergies. It's better for her to learn about it sooner rather than later.", "ESH, especially if people will be taking it in turns cooking but Ava's parents have to cook for her every night it just feels mean - but they can't have food no-one else likes either.\n\nFeels like there's an easy compromise here of having some meals Ava can join in on and some she can't if all the other kids will enjoy it. Or looking again at the substitutions - for most allergies there are subs that wouldn't affect the overall type of meal.\n\nThey're your friends. They (and their 5 yo) can't help the allergies. Talk it out like grown ups who like each other.", "ESH except for poor Ava. I think the parents should be responsible for providing food for Ava, but I think there\u2019s a pretty easy compromise of doing some meals together (to include Ava and teach kids about someone close to them) and some separately (so that Ava can learn that she can be included without having the same food as everyone else, which yes, is something her parents should prepare her for).\n\nPlanning group trips is super stressful so it\u2019s easy to see how both parties could overlook compromises, but I think there are many ways here to make everyone happy!", "That's normal with food allergies and she should learn to get used to it now rather than later.\n\nI have a shellfish allergy. Not deadly, but definitely leaves me uncomfortable for hours after. I just don't eat it (Rarely when I really crave something but then I have to deal with the annoyance for a while). I've been to seafood places with friends and just ate fish dishes while watching my friends chow down on crabs and prawns lol. No big deal really.", "The allergic child's mother is being ridiculous,  frankly. Expecting everyone to stick to only what her daughter can eat? How entitled can you get? Imagine an adult holiday with one alcoholic wanting to come along and insisting no one drinks! NTA.", "Esh neither of you need to have your way 100% on this. An effort can be made to include Ava in a few meals and the other parents can use it as an opportunity to teach their kids manners, and ava can be taught that she deserves friends who accomodate her but that accommodations are not a way of life she should expect and that she needs to get used to eating differently from but with groups", "YTA. Not every meal should be catered to the allergic child, but enough to include her should be. You knew about the allergy when you invited them.", "NTA - I would not trust anyone else to shop for all\nof the food my food allergy having kid could eat. And I would not feel comfortable doing all the food shopping for someone else\u2019s child who had food allergies.  I don\u2019t think it should be a problem for Ava\u2019s parents to do the shipping for their family. \n\nCooking for a big group, with one person having lots of food allergies is ripe for cross contamination if dishes she can\u2019t eat are being prepared.  \n\nAre you all taking turns cooking?  Or is Ava\u2019s mom doing all the cooking? If she wants to \n\nAva is going to be around lots of people who are going to eat things she can\u2019t, so her mother insisting if Ava can\u2019t eat it Alex shouldn\u2019t, (or no one else should), is a bit much.  Alex shouldn\u2019t be forced to eat only what Ava can, no one should. If that\u2019s going to be her mom\u2019s approach, she will get left out of a lot in a few years because no one will want to be around her. \n\nThere are ways to make certain dishes without allergens that look like the same dish prepared the way it normally is. Not knowing what the allergens are, I don\u2019t know how difficult it would be. \n\nI think the adults need to have a face to face talk.", "NTA. I don\u2019t expect people to feed my daughter with food allergies. The only issue I see is if she has airborne reactions and you are bringing those foods. My daughter is airborne reactive to nuts but is only mildly allergic to eggs. I would be fine with eggs in the house and others eating them but not nuts", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
