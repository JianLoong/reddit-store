We are living in different countries, a 6-8 hr drive apart, because I (35M) went back to full-time school, and she can only work in her country. This way, she could work during her pregnancy, to save up for mat leave.  \n\nWhen her labour started, I was on rotation for my school.  I got permission to leave and drove ~8 hrs to make it there at midnight, just in time.  \n\nShe said she had unexpected bleeding and very painful contractions for 2hrs in the waiting room while she waited for a doctor.  But by time I got there, she was peacefully talking to her mother.  She got an epidural, and asked to wait to push until I arrived.  Our baby was born in the middle of the night.  She had a 3rd degree tear and a very large hemorrhoid from pushing.\n\nThey moved us to a cramped room with a bed for her and a recliner that was very uncomfortable for me to sleep in.  MIL went home, and returned at night to relieve me.  I went home, slept overnight, showered, and felt refreshed.\n\nI returned the next morning.  I told her how great it was to sleep in our bed, and take a shower (her condo shower has the best pressure). Told her I badly needed it after driving all day + spending the next day in hospital. \n \nAt that point, they had moved to a private room, which still only had a fold-out padded chair that MIL had slept in.  My wife complained that she couldn't take a shower because the bathroom didn't have any warm water, the baby had been up all night crying/feeding, and that it hurt for her to walk because of the tear/hemorrhoid. \n\nNow our baby is 2 months old.  I managed to have a few weeks off, which I spent with them.  MIL is staying with wife to help with baby.  \n\nA week ago, we got into an argument about something.  She started accusing me of never once having woken up at night to help with the baby, and told me that it was very inconsiderate of me to have bragged about my shower/sleep, when she couldn't have those luxuries in the hospital. She said I should have seen that she was sleep-deprived and still covered in her own sweat/blood, and that it was callous and dense of me to make those comments.  She said it showed a lack of compassion.  I didn't make those comments maliciously!!  \n\nI had gone about 48 hours without a shower, and combined with the 8hr travel, I felt quite filthy. I had also woke up at 5 AM and did a 5 hour shift before driving up 8-10 hours to get to the hospital. It had been over 36 hours before I had last slept in a bed. I expressed to my wife that it felt great to take a shower and sleep because of the sleep deficit I had, and because of how filthy I was feeling. I mentioned that having a good night of sleep, and a shower meant that I felt fresh and could be fully present for her and the baby And as helpful as possible during this time.

Why did you decide to have a baby without you being able to be there as the father? Some background information would be helpful I think, you're being rather vague there. For me, this story is horrible because when I have my baby, I want my partner to be present and my romantic relationship would never bear it if I was left alone by him in this important situation. What you report here reflects exactly that for me: no matter what arrangements you have made, it seems like your wife feels like she is alone with the baby. Whatever circumstances have led to this.\n\nThat's why I can't pass judgment here.

She was still filthy and exhausted when you came back, and you decided to tell her about how nice you felt after showering and sleeping comfortably?\n\nYes YTA for all of the above, and also for missing the way bigger picture. Clearly your wife was still harboring resentment over this but it was only one small example of the fact that *you aren't doing your share*. You barely even mention that in the post, and you just ended up justifying what you said in the hospital (for which YTA too) instead of addressing the real issue.

I think my husband has eaten a fish sandwich from McDonald\u2019s one time in the 28 years that I have known him, and it was while I was in labor, in pain, and unable to eat anything, and he filled the delivery room with the nasty smell of fish.  \n\nMy son is 21 years old, and I have never forgotten this.  Obviously I have forgiven him, or we wouldn\u2019t still be together, but I have never forgotten.  \n\nWhatever you \u201cwent through\u201d while your wife was in labor, believe me, she had it worse.

Oh, did I mention yet that she PUSHED YOUR CHILD OUT OF HER????\n\nShe\u2019s absolutely right that talking about how refreshed YOU were, after everything she went through and being deprived of the same luxuries you had, is pretty much the height of insensitivity.\n\nYTA", "My man, YTA.

Your comment about how badly you needed sleep and and a warm shower right after your wife gave birth is a true AH move.

We are living in different countries, a 6-8 hr drive apart, because I (35M) went back to full-time school, and she can only work in her country. This way, she could work during her pregnancy, to save up for mat leave.  \n\nWhen her labour started, I was on rotation for my school.  I got permission to leave and drove ~8 hrs to make it there at midnight, just in time.  \n\nShe said she had unexpected bleeding and very painful contractions for 2hrs in the waiting room while she waited for a doctor.  But by time I got there, she was peacefully talking to her mother.  She got an epidural, and asked to wait to push until I arrived.  Our baby was born in the middle of the night.  She had a 3rd degree tear and a very large hemorrhoid from pushing.\n\nThey moved us to a cramped room with a bed for her and a recliner that was very uncomfortable for me to sleep in.  MIL went home, and returned at night to relieve me.  I went home, slept overnight, showered, and felt refreshed.\n\nI returned the next morning.  I told her how great it was to sleep in our bed, and take a shower (her condo shower has the best pressure). Told her I badly needed it after driving all day + spending the next day in hospital. \n \nAt that point, they had moved to a private room, which still only had a fold-out padded chair that MIL had slept in.  My wife complained that she couldn't take a shower because the bathroom didn't have any warm water, the baby had been up all night crying/feeding, and that it hurt for her to walk because of the tear/hemorrhoid. \n\nNow our baby is 2 months old.  I managed to have a few weeks off, which I spent with them.  MIL is staying with wife to help with baby.  \n\nA week ago, we got into an argument about something.  She started accusing me of never once having woken up at night to help with the baby, and told me that it was very inconsiderate of me to have bragged about my shower/sleep, when she couldn't have those luxuries in the hospital. She said I should have seen that she was sleep-deprived and still covered in her own sweat/blood, and that it was callous and dense of me to make those comments.  She said it showed a lack of compassion.  I didn't make those comments maliciously!!  \n\nI had gone about 48 hours without a shower, and combined with the 8hr travel, I felt quite filthy. I had also woke up at 5 AM and did a 5 hour shift before driving up 8-10 hours to get to the hospital. It had been over 36 hours before I had last slept in a bed. I expressed to my wife that it felt great to take a shower and sleep because of the sleep deficit I had, and because of how filthy I was feeling. I mentioned that having a good night of sleep, and a shower meant that I felt fresh and could be fully present for her and the baby And as helpful as possible during this time.

Fortunately my hospital shower had hot water. I took a shower, ate a snack, then took a nap. But the nurses kept coming in to check either me or baby so I only could sleep an hour or so at a time.
