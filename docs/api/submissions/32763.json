We are living in different countries, a 6-8 hr drive apart, because I (35M) went back to full-time school, and she can only work in her country. This way, she could work during her pregnancy, to save up for mat leave.  \n\nWhen her labour started, I was on rotation for my school.  I got permission to leave and drove ~8 hrs to make it there at midnight, just in time.  \n\nShe said she had unexpected bleeding and very painful contractions for 2hrs in the waiting room while she waited for a doctor.  But by time I got there, she was peacefully talking to her mother.  She got an epidural, and asked to wait to push until I arrived.  Our baby was born in the middle of the night.  She had a 3rd degree tear and a very large hemorrhoid from pushing.\n\nThey moved us to a cramped room with a bed for her and a recliner that was very uncomfortable for me to sleep in.  MIL went home, and returned at night to relieve me.  I went home, slept overnight, showered, and felt refreshed.\n\nI returned the next morning.  I told her how great it was to sleep in our bed, and take a shower (her condo shower has the best pressure). Told her I badly needed it after driving all day + spending the next day in hospital. \n \nAt that point, they had moved to a private room, which still only had a fold-out padded chair that MIL had slept in.  My wife complained that she couldn't take a shower because the bathroom didn't have any warm water, the baby had been up all night crying/feeding, and that it hurt for her to walk because of the tear/hemorrhoid. \n\nNow our baby is 2 months old.  I managed to have a few weeks off [ETA: 2.5 wks], which I spent with them.  MIL is staying with wife to help with baby.  \n\nA week ago, we got into an argument about something.  She started accusing me of never once having woken up at night to help with the baby, and told me that it was very inconsiderate of me to have bragged about my shower/sleep, when she couldn't have those luxuries in the hospital. She said I should have seen that she was sleep-deprived and still covered in her own sweat/blood, and that it was callous and dense of me to make those comments.  She said it showed a lack of compassion.  I didn't make those comments maliciously!!  \n\nI had gone about 48 hours without a shower, and combined with the 8hr travel, I felt quite filthy. I had also woke up at 5 AM and did a 5 hour shift before driving up 8-10 hours to get to the hospital. It had been over 36 hours before I had last slept in a bed. I expressed to my wife that it felt great to take a shower and sleep because of the sleep deficit I had, and because of how filthy I was feeling. I mentioned that having a good night of sleep, and a shower meant that I felt fresh and could be fully present for her and the baby And as helpful as possible during this time.

Why did you decide to have a baby without you being able to be there as the father? Some background information would be helpful I think, you're being rather vague there. For me, this story is horrible because when I have my baby, I want my partner to be present and my romantic relationship would never bear it if I was left alone by him in this important situation. What you report here reflects exactly that for me: no matter what arrangements you have made, it seems like your wife feels like she is alone with the baby.

She was still filthy and exhausted when you came back, and you decided to tell her about how nice you felt after showering and sleeping comfortably?\n\nYes YTA for all of the above, and also for missing the way bigger picture. Clearly your wife was still harboring resentment over this but it was only one small example of the fact that *you aren't doing your share*.

I think my husband has eaten a fish sandwich from McDonald\u2019s one time in the 28 years that I have known him, and it was while I was in labor, in pain, and unable to eat anything, and he filled the delivery room with the nasty smell of fish.  \n\nMy son is 21 years old, and I have never forgotten this.

We are living in different countries, a 6-8 hr drive apart, because I (35M) went back to full-time school, and she can only work in her country. This way, she could work during her pregnancy, to save up for mat leave.  \n\nWhen her labour started, I was on rotation for my school.  I got permission to leave and drove ~8 hrs to make it there at midnight, just in time.  \n\nShe said she had unexpected bleeding and very painful contractions for 2hrs in the waiting room while she waited for a doctor.  But by time I got there, she was peacefully talking to her mother.  She got an epidural, and asked to wait to push until I arrived.  Our baby was born in the middle of the night.  She had a 3rd degree tear and a very large hemorrhoid from pushing.\n\nThey moved us to a cramped room with a bed for her and a recliner that was very uncomfortable for me to sleep in.  MIL went home, and returned at night to relieve me.  I went home, slept overnight, showered, and felt refreshed.\n\nI returned the next morning.  I told her how great it was to sleep in our bed, and take a shower (her condo shower has the best pressure). Told her I badly needed it after driving all day + spending the next day in hospital. \n \nAt that point, they had moved to a private room, which still only had a fold-out padded chair that MIL had slept in.  My wife complained that she couldn't take a shower because the bathroom didn't have any warm water, the baby had been up all night crying/feeding, and that it hurt for her to walk because of the tear/hemorrhoid. \n\nNow our baby is 2 months old.  I managed to have a few weeks off, which I spent with them.  MIL is staying with wife to help with baby.  \n\nA week ago, we got into an argument about something.  She started accusing me of never once having woken up at night to help with the baby, and told me that it was very inconsiderate of me to have bragged about my shower/sleep, when she couldn't have those luxuries in the hospital. She said I should have seen that she was sleep-deprived and still covered in her own sweat/blood, and that it was callous and dense of me to make those comments.  She said it showed a lack of compassion.  I didn't make those comments maliciously!!  \n\nI had gone about 48 hours without a shower, and combined with the 8hr travel, I felt quite filthy. I had also woke up at 5 AM and did a 5 hour shift before driving up 8-10 hours to get to the hospital. It had been over 36 hours before I had last slept in a bed. I expressed to my wife that it felt great to take a shower and sleep because of the sleep deficit I had, and because of how filthy I was feeling. I mentioned that having a good night of sleep, and a shower meant that I felt fresh and could be fully present for her and the baby And as helpful as possible during this time.

Fortunately my hospital shower had hot water. I took a shower, ate a snack, then took a nap. But the nurses kept coming in to check either me or baby so I only could sleep an hour or so at a time.

After Christmas I\u2019m going to buy some petty couture!", "And he could\u2019ve stayed in the same country and worked instead of going back to school, full time at that, which doesn\u2019t leave him with room to work much.", "Yes and he can resume those plans in a year from now.", "Another doctor who won\u2019t give a flying fuck about women\u2019s health or our pain. Lovely.", "Lol, another thing military wives do every day!", "Get your OB to refer you to a pelvic floor PT!! They can give you exercise to reduce tension where needed and increase it in other areas so that you don\u2019t need to cross your legs to sneeze! It\u2019s common after birth, but common doesn\u2019t mean normal. And there is definitely a solution available!", "Pelvic floor physical therapy! Look into it, and there\u2019s a chance your insurance will cover it. There\u2019s a physical therapy place close to where I live and they had like 1 lady that specialized in it and it was a long wait! It\u2019s not super popular in the US yet (I\u2019m assuming that\u2019s where you\u2019re at) but it is becoming more of a thing! \n\nIt usually involves an internal pelvic exam at least at the first session (although this is often optional, they can get a lot of info just doing external touching if you\u2019re not comfortable with some lady\u2019s fingers up your vag) and they teach you how to do proper kegels and make sure you\u2019re doing it right. They give you some light exercises to do every day at home (like 15 min a day probably and stuff you can do while for example standing cooking dinner, but it really depends)\n\nI\u2019d recommend doing the internal exam, if you\u2019re comfortable. I had 2 second degree tears and one internal and she was like \u201cI feel some scar tissue in here, I\u2019m going to release it\u201d rubbed it for less than 2 min and the difference was insane! Like, immediately! I went about 2 years post partum but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever too late.\n\nNot trying to sound like an ad lol but it can make a big difference and not a lot of women know about it so I\u2019m out here preaching lol", "Of course! I'm glad that you are happy and I agree. I think maybe sometimes people get their heads stuck in the clouds and forget to consider others feelings, and that it can go on like that for a while. Like rose colored glasses, but with emotions.", "And that's why I have a job! This is something that comes up all the time with the providers I work with and my response is always \"I can't deliver babies!\" Health informatics and statistics are here to help you with providing data for evidence-based medicine, but y'all are doing the actual medicine.", "Omg this story is hilarious. My husband burned a small spot on his hand on a hot pan while he was making lunch the same day I had my son. He complained that I was hurting his burn because I was squeezing his hand\u2026 I was in active labor 10 cm zero medication trying to get situated on the bed to deliver and he is complaining about his hand!! Apparently shortly after this I also reached up and physically choked him but I have zero memory of this I was so lost in birth it\u2019s blank. I conveniently leave out the first part of his complaining when I tell the story though cuz he feels bad enough without me rubbing it in lol.", "Doesn\u2019t really sound like he\u2019s doing anything when he\u2019s home, either.", "So why was the MIL sleeping in the hospital after his wife gave birth instead of him?", "Why don\u2019t you buy now? She has the 10% discount and it ends on Christmas", "Wow. I'm glad that you signed up for this so that every woman must be ok with this treatment because you had that experience. Lol.", "I agree with you yet again. I think that sometimes people have gotten so used to being single that they forget to prioritize someone else. That's the best case scenario I can think of. Worst cases that he simply does not care about his wife or his child.", "He needed his shower wower and sleepy weepy. Poor wittle man was tired.", "My size is out of stock sadly otherwise I would plus I just spent plenty on my friends and family", "Those are great reasons! I still haven\u2019t gotten around to Christmas shopping. But my size is also unavailable so no petty merch for me \ud83e\udd72"]}
