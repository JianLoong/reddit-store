When I was strapping my son in his car seat in the parking lot, a clearly pregnant woman approached me and got quite close to where I was standing (like two feet from my open car door where I was bent over to buckle my son in). She asked for help with her uber and said she doesn\u2019t speak English fluently. I spoke with the uber driver on speaker and he was at another branch of the doctor\u2019s office in another town and he advised us to cancel and book another uber. I offered to do this for her and cancelled her ride and typed the correct address into the app for her, but she kept deleting the address and then handing me the phone again. I told her I was putting the address in correctly for her but she continued to delete the address. I felt like I couldn\u2019t do much more for her at that point and said a few more times she needs to enter the correct address into the app. There was a clear language barrier; I only speak English  and am average at Spanish and her phone had Farsi letters on it which other than recognizing that have no knowledge of. I started to leave and she kept asking me to stay and help her. I told her I needed to get home and that she wasn\u2019t allowing me to help her. She got very snippy towards me as I got in my car and left. I felt bad because she was pregnant and seemed distressed about getting home, but I felt like we were at a stalemate in what I could do for her and I was also uncomfortable with how close she approached me initially, that I was with my young son, and that she kept deleting the address when I typed it in.

Pregnant or not, she was still a stranger and I believe in trusting your instincts.  You tried several times to help  to no avail.  Your priority is to get your own child home safely.  She can call someone else.", "NTA. That seems sus. You tried to help. It was more important to take your son away from there.", "NTA.  Your son is your number one responsibility.  You protected yourself and your son.  I don't trust anyone these days.   I think she wanted you to give her money.", " NTA, as I left I might have called the police non-emergency line and asked if they could send assistance but doesn\u2019t sound like much more you could have done especially with a child in the car", "Nta hopefully she found someone else who was able to help her. Clearly you had a communication problem. My paranoid side says she was keeping you there for a carjacking. Or maybe she just wanted a lift to some out of the way place. I like to be kind but this situation makes me feel uncomfortable.", "NTA. I smell a scam", "NTA\n\nWho's to say she is really pregnant.", "NTA. That\u2019s a dangerous situation. In the front seat or back seat the driver is at a disadvantage if attacked by a passenger. You also would be going to a secondary, also unknown, location. You don\u2019t know who\u2019s there and you don\u2019t know this person nor what is on their person, like weapons. I may have called police non emergency to be safe, but I wouldn\u2019t have given a ride either, especially with your son involved. It\u2019s unfortunate, maybe if she gave you cash you could order the Uber, maybe call a taxi for her or non emergency, but there\u2019s nothing you can do without taking on a potentially serious risk. There are a lot of human traffickers as well as just dangerous people who target people, like a lone woman with a child, through emotional manipulation. Pregnant women will strike an emotional cord for mothers specifically. I get we want to see the best in people, but where safety of you and your child are concerned, it\u2019s not worth the risk. No one thinks it will happen to them until it\u2019s too late.", "Sounds like she was up to something.  She was trying to get an invite into your car.  So many ways for that to go wrong.

This sounds extremely sus. Sounds like she was trying to invite herself into your car. The deleting of the address multiple times is just odd. I think you did all that a person could reasonably be expected to do in that situation and kept your wits about yourself and your son.", "NTA. You did what you could. She could have asked the receptionist for help if she really needed it so it does seem sketchy.", "Are sure the \"Uber driver\" was legit?

I assume it wasnt 9 am when you picked your kid up. Second, if she speaks a different language, you can set your phone up to be in a different language.  \n\nI highly doubt somebody who speaks English knows the word 'fluently'..   \n\nIt was a scam. She kept deleting the address on purpose.  \n\nScammers target people who are alone. Especially if they have a small child.

You tried to help and it\u2019s completely understandable that your first priority was keeping your kid safe. \n\nHer behaviour seems sus. That said, where you are, is it necessary to type the pick-up address instead of letting the app find the location via gps?", "NTA.", "NTA\nYou try to help her, but as you said you hit a stalemate, after she kept deleting the address. If you keep trying to help her & she still deletes address, you\u2019ll be there for ages. You have your child with you & you can\u2019t stop what you doing, for too long. \n\nBut I have a feeling she might be trying to con you into giving her a lift & maybe mug you. When I was on a business trip last month, staff at hotel told guests about a con going on in the area. This what they said-\nWhile a person is getting into their car, they get approached by someone, that is having problems getting home, because issues with Uber/taxi/bus or they have no money. So car owner would offer them a lift, but instead of going to a house, they are lead to a trap. The approacher would hold a weapon to car owner head/neck & the others (with the approacher) will jump out from where they are hiding. Car owner gotten their car & other belongings stolen. Staff said it happened to 3 people in the area.", "Nta\n\nShe was trying to scan you or worse.", "NTA.\n\nMy take.\n\nShe was clearly going to use an Uber. At worst. Her language skills are so poor that it made it an ordeal. (Okay at worst she was a scammer but in terms of you being the asshole this would be a good thing).\n\nShe was in a safe place. A doctors office. At this point its on the Doctor and their receptionist to help set her up with an uber.", "Scammy!

She can look up how to correctly call an Uber.", "NTA ever for exiting a situation which was uncomfortable and potentially dangerous. \nIf she\u2019d just left the Doctor\u2019s office (where presumably there is someone on staff who can communicate with her to some extent), she can go back in and ask for help.

I can say it in English, German, Swedish, Spanish and Danish (if I put a potato in my mouth lol).\n\nI had German in school, don't remember much else but the phrase \"ich spreche nicht so gut Deutch\", and with Spanish I only know some words and phrases, two of them being \"no hablo espa\u00f1ol\" and \"un poquito Espa\u00f1ol\", due to family living in Spain and I visited there a lot until a few years ago.\n\nNTA OP", "Mine closes at 9pm and is open on Saturdays", "Since never where I am (Australia).

They open early afternoon and close at like 10pm.", "Where I'm at (not the US), we have to put in pickup location. The app (if left to find the location) might bring them close to where you are but not the exact location (can be off by a few buildings). So typing in the pickup location (or the nearest landmark) is necessary. Sometimes, you might even have to add extra direction instructions in the in-app chat.\n\nEdited.", "No offence taken, I know my German is rough lol. But according to Germans I at least sound German when speaking even if my German is a little rough. But that might be because my native language have several sounds that are similar to the German sounds. My dialect kj-sound is like the German ch-sound", "That's really cool! \n\nI know it's for people who work 8-5 and can't get appointments at other Dr's offices, but I'd like to think it was started by a doctor that just ISN'T a morning person.", "Gotcha. Sorry if I came across as snarky.", "I actually once talked to the nurse that works there (I work in a different area of the medical field). The doctor is not a morning person and thought he could do some pretty good business and not have to be up super early by opening his own practice. So he did and has been pretty successful.
