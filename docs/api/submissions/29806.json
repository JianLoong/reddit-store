I spoke with the uber driver on speaker and he was at another branch of the doctor\u2019s office in another town and he advised us to cancel and book another uber.

I told her I was putting the address in correctly for her but she continued to delete the address. I felt like I couldn\u2019t do much more for her at that point and said a few more times she needs to enter the correct address into the app. There was a clear language barrier; I only speak English  and am average at Spanish and her phone had Farsi letters on it which other than recognizing that have no knowledge of.

I can sometimes be over cautious with people especially since  having my son, but this eases my mind that I made the right choice. One thing to clarify is she definitely was pregnant because of the after visit paper work I saw in her hand while typing in her phone (I did snoop to check since I felt off when she approached me). Since that was clear, I was more akin to help her than I might with other people. However, that\u2019s not to say pregnant people can\u2019t be involved in some shady things as well.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nFor those mentioning Google translate or language apps: I agree wholeheartedly and have had to use them upon occasion with my husband\u2019s family when I don\u2019t know how to say something in Spanish. This interaction was probably 3-4 minutes so I think it could have gotten to that point but 1.  I didn\u2019t really care that much in this case if that makes sense since it wasn\u2019t really my problem. If I needed help I would use the translation app but I feel like it\u2019s more on the person who needs the help to initiate that. 2. I was keeping my hands clear just in case something happened so I wasn\u2019t going to bring my phone into the mix. 3. The woman did seem genuinely overwhelmed and worried. She was pregnant according to her doctor summary in her hand, she was trying to communicate with the Uber driver, texting with someone maybe asking for help, trying to interact with me, the parking lot was clearing out and it was getting close to nighttime. Thus, I think all those factors made it where that wasn\u2019t something we did in that moment.", "NTA. I keep thinking it sounds like a set up.

First of all, Uber pinpoints your location so there isn\u2019t a need to enter in an address.

I also wasn\u2019t going to get my phone out to do that because I wanted to keep my hands clear just in case and the help I offered her was pretty clear cut by typing the exact address into her Uber app. This exchange was probably around 3-4 minutes so I think we could have reached the point of Google translate but I wasn\u2019t comfortable to keep trying which ended the interaction.", "Yeah never hand your phone to someone else for something like that.

I told him calmly to give my phone back. He punched me again. Told him calmly again. He punched again. I told him again - I remember being punched (with a hook), but It did not really bother me.
