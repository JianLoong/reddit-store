I spoke with the uber driver on speaker and he was at another branch of the doctor\u2019s office in another town and he advised us to cancel and book another uber.

I can sometimes be over cautious with people especially since  having my son, but this eases my mind that I made the right choice. One thing to clarify is she definitely was pregnant because of the after visit paper work I saw in her hand while typing in her phone (I did snoop to check since I felt off when she approached me). Since that was clear, I was more akin to help her than I might with other people. However, that\u2019s not to say pregnant people can\u2019t be involved in some shady things as well.\n\nEdit to add:\n\nFor those mentioning Google translate or language apps: I agree wholeheartedly and have had to use them upon occasion with my husband\u2019s family when I don\u2019t know how to say something in Spanish. This interaction was probably 3-4 minutes so I think it could have gotten to that point but 1.  I didn\u2019t really care that much in this case if that makes sense since it wasn\u2019t really my problem. If I needed help I would use the translation app but I feel like it\u2019s more on the person who needs the help to initiate that. 2. I was keeping my hands clear just in case something happened so I wasn\u2019t going to bring my phone into the mix. 3. The woman did seem genuinely overwhelmed and worried. She was pregnant according to her doctor summary in her hand, she was trying to communicate with the Uber driver, texting with someone maybe asking for help, trying to interact with me, the parking lot was clearing out and it was getting close to nighttime. Thus, I think all those factors made it where that wasn\u2019t something we did in that moment.", "NTA. I keep thinking it sounds like a set up.

She had a small child, about 4y.o with her and said that they are mother and child, tourists trying to get to an airbnb (fair enough, there are indeed airbnb-s in that area) and that she really needs to use a phone to call the host because she doesn't have the connection. I stupidly handed over my phone because there was a small girl literally at 2am in the street. \n\nLuckily it seemed a little sus enough that when I went to check what number she was typing in, she was actually on my amazon account, trying to change my e-mail address.  Don't even know what the scam is there but I felt really unsafe afterwards and I didn't before, even though I did before, being a woman walking alone in the streets at night. \ud83d\ude25\n\nNot saying that this is the case, also I feel angry that can't even help people with innocent children with them any more.", "NTA you did the right thing.

You are talking about helping someone in your JOB using a translation app. I am a therapist and have worked with various people who speak languages I don\u2019t, at which point I use our language line to assist. I think what I would do in a planned employment situation is very different than what I would do when a random person approached me. \n\n2. I never assumed her erasing the address was done with bad intentions. I said it was confusing to me and the overall interaction made me anxious and confused. Others have referenced it could have potentially been a trafficking or scam situation. I have commented several times that\u2019s not how I personally felt about it. \n\n3. My son is 2 years old. He would never remember or understand what this interaction meant. However, I will be teaching my son both the importance of helping while also keeping himself safe. I did try to help. I also wanted him to be safe. \n\n4. I am a woman with a young child. That is one of the most vulnerable positions to be in as a woman. I have felt more unsafe as a mom with a kid than I ever did while pregnant. I had to worry not only about myself but my sons being safe, my vehicle, and my belongings. There are many sickos in the world as you said. I don\u2019t believe her intention was bad or harmful, but I can\u2019t also assume she had perfectly pure intentions either and offer my help with no limitations. \n\n5. I didn\u2019t use my phone to translate because I wanted to keep my hands free in case something happened. She quite literally walked up behind me and was two feet away from me while I was bent over putting my two year old in his car seat. No matter what the intention I was immediately uncomfortable with the situation.  Despite that, I put myself in a safer position by closing and locking my car and then still tried to help her. \n\n6. I spoke very basic, slow English to her since I don\u2019t speak her language at all. I also spoke with the Uber driver and typed the correct address for her to get another driver. I do feel she has a level of personal responsibility when leaving her home to be able to communicate and translate if needed, whether that be with an app or having someone on standby she could text or call for assistance. You\u2019re putting the personal responsibility on me for another grown adult\u2019s choices. \n\n7. I do agree that the doctors office could have taken some responsibility but perhaps she was not communicating their needs to them as well? I\u2019m a therapist and we have a language line in our office if needed and they could have best assisted her. They were closed when she sought me for help. \n\n8. This woman was not in imminent danger or having a medical emergency. I would have called 911 or sought additional help if that was the case. \n\n9. This is less relevant, but I needed to be home by a certain time to have dinner home before my husband\u2019s overnight shift and allow him to see our son. Again, if there was a true emergency that would have made these details irrelevant and I would have stayed longer but because we weren\u2019t getting anywhere and I was not comfortable I chose to leave. \n\nI feel you are trying to wrap this situation up into a perfect little bow. This was MINUTES long not hours. I was thinking in the moment while having some anxiety over the situation.

Did you ever think she felt comfortable approaching you because you're also a mom? If you were a 6ft big burly dude i dont think she would have felt as comfortable asking for help. Regardless of whether or not this was during work hours  i think the whole point is if you dont understand someone you have resources to do so. What did you think this woman would do ? You have a car and could just leave ? She wasnt asking for money it didnt seem like she cared anything about your  child i think she might have been confused about the app thus why i mentioned you could have used a translator app ive used these many times while not being at work.much of what your saying puts blame on this woman who again you say has responsibility to what? If your a refugee you dont get to choose what country you go to you also dont get a say in which town you go to you LITERALLY DONT KNOW THE LANGUAGE OR CULTURE at all meaning if you say you spoke very basic slow English to her that wouldn't matter if she again doesnt know the language the speed at which you speak doesnt matter at that point. You blame this woman again by not at least acknowledging that if you have a patient no matter who they are you are responsible in making sure your patients have a way to get home ive worked in healthcare for 10 years never heard of staff leaving someone who doesnt know English to fend for themselves especially someone pregnant. It sounds like the doc staff didnt care enough to make sure this patient was okay. Since you couldn't understand what she was saying is it really valid to say she wasn't in imminent danger how would you know and what would imminent danger look like to you or a medical emergency (which can happen without blood or broken bones) as well. And it sounds like even if there was imminent danger you would have left anyway. You being a therapist i guess i would have expected more empathy at least in your reasoning but this whole response puts the blame on someone who cant even defend themselves especially when they didn't do anything wrong. I think the real reason you posted on here is because you felt guilty and needed people to exonerate you and validate your feelings so it would get you off the hook for not helping as much i think you hopefully wanted to do. Its okay to have stranger danger but it didnt sound like this woman was a threat  and you painting the picture of her in that way is really sad. You kept mentioning you had to be home to bring dinner and such which your right wasn't relevant and just makes it seem like dinner was more of a priority than having to deal with the inconvenience of helping someone out.
