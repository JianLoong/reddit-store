We've been together for just over a year. We moved in together around 3 months ago, or rather she moved in with me. We were both single parents, I have a 14 year old daughter and she has a 16 year old daughter. Our kids never really got along, they're not hostile towards each other but they have completely different characters and don't really have anything in common. My daughter likes my girlfriend but my girlfriends daughter doesn't really like me. \n\nSo I wasn't working on Thursday and decided to pick up the girls from school because I was bored (they usually get an uber). After lunch her daughter went up to her room as always while mine stayed in the living room watching Disney+. After about an hour or so she asked me if we could go shopping because she wanted to get some new shoes and other clothes. So I agreed and I told her daughter that we were leaving. The shopping took us longer than I expected and we came back after about 4 hours and by that time my girlfriend was already home from work. And when she saw all the shopping bags she got mad that I didn't take her daughter shopping too. We argued about this for a while and I told her that I don't mind spoiling my daughter but I'm not going to spend my money on her kid when she never spends money on mine. She then started pointing out how I make more than her etc etc and it became a whole thing.

That isn't fair to the other child and it must be split. An aunt might want to take one child on vacation with them. Do you force the aunt to take both kids?

Favoritism towards your own kids over your SO\u2019s kids is not ok. If you can\u2019t respect and understand the situation that kids are put into during divorce and remarriage, and you can\u2019t find a way to positively integrate your kids into your family then just stay single. It\u2019s a choice to get remarried. Kids are going to react negatively because they don\u2019t have a choice in the matter and because\u2026. They\u2019re kids, and are too young to know how to deal with the situation."]}
