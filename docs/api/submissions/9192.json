We've been together for just over a year. We moved in together around 3 months ago, or rather she moved in with me. We were both single parents, I have a 14 year old daughter and she has a 16 year old daughter. Our kids never really got along, they're not hostile towards each other but they have completely different characters and don't really have anything in common. My daughter likes my girlfriend but my girlfriends daughter doesn't really like me. \n\nSo I wasn't working on Thursday and decided to pick up the girls from school because I was bored (they usually get an uber). After lunch her daughter went up to her room as always while mine stayed in the living room watching Disney+. After about an hour or so she asked me if we could go shopping because she wanted to get some new shoes and other clothes. So I agreed and I told her daughter that we were leaving. The shopping took us longer than I expected and we came back after about 4 hours and by that time my girlfriend was already home from work. And when she saw all the shopping bags she got mad that I didn't take her daughter shopping too. We argued about this for a while and I told her that I don't mind spoiling my daughter but I'm not going to spend my money on her kid when she never spends money on mine. She then started pointing out how I make more than her etc etc and it became a whole thing.

I never said he had to buy SD a thing. Also, following that thought ....isn't that what he may be doing with his own daughter? I mean ....", "Where does OP say that? If it\u2019s in the comments I\u2019m not going searching for it \ud83d\ude02", "Yes.

I don\u2019t think she\u2019d say that if they split finances since she\u2019d have access to the combined incomes. Sometimes you gotta read between the lines on these posts", "NTA.  Your girlfriend can't have it both ways. The fact that you make more doesn't mean you have to provide for her child and she doesn't have to provide for yours. Either you both provide for each other's children  or you both support your own children separately.  If you making more and being able to spoil your own daughter is a problem for her than maybe she shouldn't have moved in with you. Your daughters are at an age were you could have waited for them to be adults before living together.  Especially if the agreement is to financially support your own child. I'm curious if moving in with you upgraded her lifestyle? Do you have the better house?", "Yeah we don't share finances", "My take was that they might be splitting the bills from their separate accounts, but when it came to disposable income for stuff like taking the girls shopping, he had more and it would be nice to treat her daughter, which is reasonable.\n\nUnless he brought finances into it and fairness, I don\u2019t think this is the reason he didn\u2019t take (or offer to take) her daughter shopping.\n\nI\u2019ve done a few of these posts now ;-)", "Couldn't you take both girls, and ask your gf to pay back what you spend on her daughter later? (ask her if its okay beforehand). That way no one gets left out and you don't have to pay extra?", "Info: You made a point to state your girlfriend moved in with you. Did you really want to move in with your girlfriend? You confirmed that finances are kept separate.  Did you  discuss financial support when it xomes to each other children? It's not an automatic given that you raise each other's kids as your own. Some parents are very clear that they will discipline and financial support their own kids when living together. So I wondering what was the discussion when it came to your children. Also a year really is too soon to move in when you do have children involved.  You should have spent more time getting to know each other before putting your children in a situation.", "Thanks for confirming. I still think best case you would have taken both girls, but it\u2019s not a requirement", "OP brought it up in the post that he/she doesn\u2019t buy things for the other daughter bc the girlfriend doesn\u2019t", "Honestly I thought it was too soon. But my girlfriends lease was up and she couldn't find anything else within her budget so I just said \"hey let's move in together\". I love my girlfriend but I'm not a huge fan of her daughter and she feels the same way about me.", "You should not be living together.  You weren't ready for it. Fix the mistake before you damage both girls. If you aren't a fan of your girlfriend daughter that doesn't make you an A-H but realistically the relationship can't last. It's unfair to her daughter to live with an adult that really doesn't like her. Instead of trying to make it work or pretend move on and find someone else.", "You are a very unkind person. You don\u2019t get to play house if kids are involved and you aren\u2019t going to be emotionally mature or compassionate. \n\nYou needed to be an adult and say \u201ctoo soon for us and also I\u2019m unwilling to treat your kid with kindness so nope\u201d", "I agree, it's not fair at all and she might eventually grow to like op but it sounds like op is pretty decided that they won't get along from his end", "NTA. You should have asked the other kid if she wanted to come, as she was home. She probably would\u2019ve said no, but then an attempt was made.", "NTA", "NTA. You're not married and it's not your step-child. Your allowed to do stuff between just you and your daughter. If mom wants the kid to go shopping, she can pay.

Your GF needs to pull her head out of her ass.", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta like you said you split utilities etc. And if you go out to eat you pay for all. And pay for your own stuff separately.

This is BS.", "ESH. From the sounds of it you only let her move in so she didn't end up homeless. While thats nice in theory you guys are clearly not ready for that type of relationship.

It would not have been fun for your GF\u2019s daughter to go shopping with you and watch your daughter getting new clothes and stuff while she got nothing.   Your GF and her daughter\u2019s father should be paying for her personal items, not you, beyond the general household expenses.   You are also not wrong to want one-on-one bonding time with your daughter, and going shopping together is something I bet she really enjoyed doing with you.\n\nYour GF can take her own daughter shopping without your daughter.   Or your GF can plan to give her daughter money so she can go shopping with you and your daughter and get her own things the next time something like this comes up.", "Yta for moving in with someone with kids when your not even blended with the mum..", "YTA. Yall moved in together for all intent and purposes that is your stepdaughter. Not asking the child to attend isn't going to get you any brownie points, the girls need to get a long for atleast till the older goes to college.

I have a blended family and, I spent time with each of them one on one. That being said, we all got along.", "NTA But you really need to sit down with your Gf and work out a set of expectations and rules on the way you treat one another's kids. You are perfectly right, she cannot expect you to take her daughter out and buy her a load of stuff, (that her mum might not even approve of) when your gf is not going to reciprocate to your daughter in any way.", "YTA. You spoil your daughter, and treat your stepdaughter like Cinderella. \n\nWhy would she like you exactly?\n\nAnd you blended families after 9 months? That\u2019s nuts.", "YTA, yeah. Not for not taking her shopping but for not at least inviting her. If you\u2019re a blended household, you should act like one.", "ESH. If this is how you treat each other\u2019s kids you shouldn\u2019t be living together. IMO (as someone who grew up with divorced parents and had dads gf\u2019s move in) I think that moving in after a year together is too soon when you have children.", "ESH you both have admitted you don\u2019t like each others kids why are you even in a relationship.", "ESH.", "ESH except for the kids.\n\nThese 2 girls have nothing in common.  That's perfectly okay.  They are forced to live together because their parents want to play house.  \n\nThe girls are not going to be treated equally.  Girlfriend is going to be on her daughter's side.  OP is going to on his daughter's side.  If GF wants her kid to have the same things as OP's kid, she's more than welcome to whip out her checkbook.  She shouldn't look to OP to level the financial playing field.  Likewise, OP should be able do what he wants and can afford to do for his daughter.", "ESH. I don't understand why people move in with people when their kids don't get along and one kid doesn't like the partner, etc. Nobody ever seems to care about what the kids think about these situations.", "ESH and gf pointing out OP makes more money than she is trouble. There seems little effort was put into blending thus family and these two teens are the ones to suffer.", "I think YTA for not inviting gf's daughter. From your account, you told her you were leaving. No \"Hey, we're going shopping. Are you interested in coming?\" I get that you want to spend time with your daughter, but if you're the responsible adult in the house and decide to leave, at least offer to take gf's daughter with you. It was thoughtless of you. \n\nIf you'd offered, no matter how gf's daughter responded, you probably wouldn't be having this argument right now.", "I'm leaning towards YTA. Sounds like if you'd asked her if she wanted to come too, she'd have said no - and then you would be fully in the clear and there would be no drama. That would have been the polite thing to do.
