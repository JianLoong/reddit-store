We told him he can get another animal instead, but he only wants a cat. I asked if it's because cats are the lowest maintenance pets and if this was about being lazy, and he got really angry and now won't talk to me.\n\nMy wife tried to explain as I did about the bird and dogs, but he said if he can't have the pet he wants, no one else should have what the want either.

It's basically a sandbox that cats do their business in, and you have to change it at least once a week or scoop it 1-2 times a day. It's disgusting and very hard work. Not only are you YTA, but you're wrong.", "N T A for not immediately agreeing to a cat given the current pet set up that sounds stressful for all pets involved, including a cat. But YTA overall for two reasons\n\n1 - Suggesting your son is lazy for his pet choice. Cats are still work (I have three of them) and some kids just really really like cats (my niece does, much to the chagrin of her dog people parents who never wanted a cat). This was rude and hurtful to your son, and does indicate your dislike of cats is biasing you here.\n\n2 - not even attempting to find a middle ground. I think you should talk to shelters, your vet, and do some research into introducing cats to dogs or even how the breeds of dogs you have typically respond (I.e, see what their typical prey drive is). Actually TRY to see if it\u2019s manageable or not instead of assuming it\u2019s not. Maybe see if there\u2019s a way to have the dogs supervised around a cat. Find out from professionals or good sources whether an adult cat who grew up with dogs would be an option, or if a kitten would be better. \n\nI would worry about dogs harming a cat, generally, but a lot are fine with cats. It really varies, and I think this is something that can be navigated with effort and knowledge. In short your concerns are valid, but you should actually look to potential solutions instead of saying no outright. \n\nThe bird is less of a big deal, imo, because it\u2019s probably easier to keep the cat and bird in separate rooms when the bird is not caged. I\u2019m assuming that would be shorter duration.\n\nI\u2019ve known a lot of people who\u2019ve had both cats and dogs as well as birds and cats.

Is the bird in a cage or free to roam the house?", "YTA in more ways than you know. First off, pets are not birthday gifts. They\u2019re a long-term commitment. Second, you let everyone else in the family choose their pet but now you are telling your son he can\u2019t choose his pet. Third, you accused your son of being lazy. Cats are a lot more low-maintenance than dogs but that in no way makes your son or any cat owner lazy. You shouldn\u2019t even be insulting your son to start with. There are plenty of cats in the world who love dogs and would get along just fine with them. The majority of rescues/shelters dog test for that very purpose. As for the bird, do you not have a cage? Get your son his cat.", "YTA", "YTA you are being unfair. Sounds to me like you\u2019re the lazy one who doesn\u2019t want to learn about caring for cats.

I really cannot tolerate partners like you.", "YTA. The whole idea of cats vs dogs is dated and usually wrong. Most dogs I know just leave cats alone.

He is the most mature person in this story.", "YTA for laziness comment. \n\nPlease do not combine cats and birds. Even if the cat is super friendly there is still instinct. This reasoning makes sense and should be used more. When I took care of a bird briefly I had to separate the cats and the bird. Bird had his own room and those cats were ALWAYS trying to get into the room. It's not safe. Only takes one incident.", "YTA.

Your policy also seems short sighted? Like not all kids want dogs or birds as pets (or have allergies).  Moreover, I understand your concern, but it seems that you are dismissing the possibility before exploring all options. Some cats and dogs get along great. Maybe you can split access to different areas of your home. At minimum you owe it to your youngest to consult an animal behaviorist/ trainer to see if something can be worked out.", "While I do think your concerns have some merit, certain dogs can get along with cats with proper and methodical introductions. There are a lot of resources online about this topic.\n\nAlso YTA for your assumptions about cats. I promise you they are not \u201clow maintenance pets\u201d and this is about being lazy - wtf?  Not putting in effort into taking care of a cat properly is how people end up with a lot of unwanted behaviors. Just a quick fyi that cats do bond with their humans and many will actively seek out their humans for attention (they aren\u2019t just going to sit around ignoring everyone and do nothing 100% of the time). They need daily playtime because it satisfies their innate hunting instinct. They do make messes with their litter box that needs constant cleaning, and also need to given enough scratch posts/toys so they aren\u2019t too destructive with your furniture. Cats also can be clicker trained and its a great tool for bonding and understanding how they learn (and how to train them). Sure, you don\u2019t have to walk cats like you would a dog, but I can promise you that caring for a cat isn\u2019t a \u201clazy\u201d task.", "YTA\n\nYou blame your son for wanting a cat and dare call him lazy. I've had older dogs meet cats with no problem. I also had parakeets/Cockatiels and they often were caught snuggling with the dogs/cat.

This is a totally manageable situation, if you introduce the cat to the household with some patience and attention. Your son isn\u2019t lazy, but you sure are.", "YTA\n\nCats and dogs can be trained to consider themselves part of the same pack or group.  And cats can be quite social, and protective of both people and animals it cares about.  Of course, just as with a dog, you have to do the work of introducing the animals, training them properly.  A dog can be just as awful for a pet bird or other dogs if you don't do your part to train and socialized.  \n\nFor the bird, you don't say what kind it is, or what size.  If you look at youtube, there are plenty of videos of cats, particularly kittens, bonding with birds, especially if they get to know each other when the cat is still a kitten.  \n\nYou, as the parent, would need to do the work of helping your son train his pet, and socialize it with the other animals.  That would be true whether he gets a bird, dog or cat.  \n\nIf anyone sounds \"lazy\" in this situation, it's you, for not wanting to do the work of training and socializing the new pet into the household, and hoping a dog would naturally integrate itself into the household without effort on your part.", "YTA.

Get him a kitten from the shelter. The Dogs will probably end up being its best friend as long as they are introduced sorrectgly and kept an eye on for a few weeks. My boxer dog hated cats and had on two occasions killed a cat in your back yard (about an acre and a half in size). Then we got a kitten. We only let them be together in the house when we were there. Well within 2 months they were best buddies and that kitten would sleep on top of the dog. And within a few months the dog stopped being so reactive to cats.", "YTA, and showing favoritism to the older two boys.  Cats and dogs can co-exist, and so can cats and birds.

I can understand allowing them to choose their own small pet (hamster, goldfish, turtle, iguana...whatever). Now it's the youngest son's turn to pick his pet and he chooses a cat. A very reasonable choice, imo.  Right away, he gets a big \"No way!\" Only because of the kennel you've already started, and your personal preference.

Concerns are valid, but the way you spoke to your son- is not. \n\nAlso, everyone else got to choose their pets so he has a right to be upset since you\u2019re going back on your word only for his case.", "**updating to say ESH.

It is the wise choice to not get the cat as the responsible adult in the situation.

I have a parrot I adopted after his previous owner got a cat and killed his cage mate.  A friend had birds and a cat and while she never let the birds out, the cat figured out how to grab the birds between the cage bars and kill them.   Parrot rescues often won't adopt out birds to people with cats.  If you do get a cat, please make sure it and the bird are never in the same room, whether or not the bird is caged.  \n\n\nThat said, I think this is a NAH/ESH situation.  Your son should be worried about his mom's bird and his potential cat's safety from the dogs.  You shouldn't have made an open ended promise you couldn't keep.  You're NTA for being worried about the bird/potential cat and your son is NTA for you not honoring your way too open ended promise.    \n\n\nIf your son wanted a some exotic that could poison/eat your other dogs too, Reddit would be more on your side saying 'of course you can't let him get that pet!' but technically, that would be just as much of a breach of promise.  I guess the lesson here is don't make such open ended promises.  Maybe compromise with something else he wants like a game system or something you didn't let his brothers have until they were older?    \n\n\nJust to be clear here, dead animals are a far worse outcome than breaking an unreasonable promise and hurt feelings.", "NAH\n\nYour concern about the existing animals getting along with a cat is very valid, but it is possible for cats & dogs to coexist. You just have e to put in the effort. I have a friend who has 4 cats and 2 dogs. They're all fine. However, I wouldn't consider cats low maintenance. You still have a litter box to keep clean unless you want your house to stink. And they need vet care and vaccinations just like dogs. And stimulation like playing with toys.\n\nPerhaps read up on safe ways to have multi-species households and discuss further with your son. It is possible. But everybody has to commit to putting in the work to keep all animals safe.\n\nINFO: Is the bird outside of its cage at all?", "NAH. He's justified in his feelings. You're justified in your concerns. Get a foster cat & see how the other animals handle it being there. Then you'll all see & can make a decision based on what's best for the animals. If the cat is going to be tormented, he won't want to put it through a life like that... or he won't care about the cat's feelings & should only get a goldfish.
