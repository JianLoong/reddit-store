Both Jake and Carlos used to go with me almost every week with me to the ranch, depending if they were busy.

Carlos continued to go with me until 18, when he went to college and and studied engineering in agronomy (don't know if this is the correct translation). Jake got a degree in finance. \n\nAfter college, Carlos asked me if he could move to the ranch to work there full time. Of course I agreed. That was 8 years ago.

I said I did. Then he asked me why I'm not honoring that promise. I was shocked. I asked him if he was being serious and he said yes. Then I said \"It's insane that you are expecting me to do that.

HOWEVER, you could have worded it better. I think it would be good if you apologized how you came across and explained your reasons: you have another son, Carlos is taking care of the ranch, and he has a right because he lives there and obviously loves the ranch.\n\nKeep your distance, though, because it is obvious he is hurt. If you want, write a letter to explain this. But dismissing his hurt as a \"this is ridiculous\" is not the way to talk about this.", "Nta, it is insane to think a promise someone made to you at 6 will be lifelong.

The ranch would still be Jake's, he'd just have to split it with his brother -- who, based on what you have said, has put more effort into it than him.

Hopefully with time he may come around but don't push it. Give him space for now.", "YTA.

Personally, I think you\u2019re doing a huge disservice to Carlos by splitting ownership between he and Jake. Talk to Jake and ask him what he planned to do with the ranch if you gave it to him and see what he says - but first apologize for the way you responded to him. Carlos deserves full ownership of the ranch at this point. It\u2019s his home, his family\u2019s home, and possibly his full-time job?

You\u2019re not like that woman who made her twelve year old to pay off the swimming pool once the daughter got a job.

Jake show no interested on the ranch and might sell it off for profit.", "YTA I know at the time you were thinking you wouldn't have another kid so it wouldn't be a problem, but time changed things. Since the boys are best friends you could have broached this as \"I was intending on splitting it between the two of you how do you feel about that?\" He might have been ok with it if you had an actual conversation with him about it, and heard him out.

Its understandable that you would change your mind given that Carlos asked to move to the ranch and all and has been clearly involved while Jake hasn\u2019t. You\u2019re not the AH for that. I agree with that decision and I think you are actually still being generous to still spilt the ranch when Jake seemingly has done no work and Carols has. To just respond to Jake that he\u2019s insane for thinking its the same though is really\u2026wow.

You could have explained to Jake why your thinking changed, and said you didn't realize it still mattered to him because he hasn't shown much interest in the ranch or brought up that promise in the intervening years.\n\nPromises like that, even made offhand, can be very powerful to a small child. He's grown now, of course, but I don't think it's completely shocking that his lingering 6-year-old certainty about it might have meant he hadn't really considered it practically, or even as a question at all. I think splitting the ranch between him and Carlos is more than fair to him, but going straight to \"you're being ridiculous\" was not a great way to go about the reality check.", "An explanation of what was promised would help determine if you\u2019re NTA/YTA??

What I'm saying is that lets say the ranch was worth $200k before Carlos took over. After his years of building it up, it's worth $400k. Jake gets to split the $200k that it was originally worth before Carlos put in the work. Carlos inherits half the original value plus everything he's built since he took over.", "Yes.

But OP is definitely an asshole for thinking its \"ridiculous\" that he would remember or expect that promise to be upheld. It was a promise of a home in posterity to a child of your blood. That's like- the whole point of human society up to this point.", "\"This, our property, real estate, will one day be given to you to live in\" is not an inane promise made to a child, its the original point of property. It's the whole thing we've been doing as a species for 6000 years since we invented it, working, making homes, giving those homes to our children. Until the 20th century, anyway. But still a pretty big part of the whole thing.\n\nAgain, agreeing Carlos should get the ranch and its perfectly reasonable to expect that him taking it over and Jake ignoring it, as well as the natural compromises that come with adoption, significantly alter the circumstances of that promise in ways that are perfectly fair. But don't make inane promises, and keep your promises to your children. If any promise isn't real, to you, no promise is real, from you. They will learn.\n\nEDIT: The point of mentioning the Lion King is that a 6-year old understands what \"This will all be yours someday\" is and means, because they have seen the Lion King. They understand that promise has weight, it is the circle of life, the inheritance of parent to child, their land, their place.

And since Carlos is adopted, he IS her additional child.)\n\nKeeping a promise made when she only had one child but now has two, and means the one child who has put in YEARS of work and turned it into a successful business now gets no part of it would be cruel.\n\nThe fact that one son has watched his brother work for years to make it successful all while believing that brother would get nothing is pretty damn fucked up.", "So she should give what is likely the vast majority of her estate to one son due to an ill-advised, spur of the moment promise to a 6 year old even though she now has another son,  one who haa put years of sweat equity into it and greatly increased the value of the business through his efforts? And she's supposed to just conjure up \"something else\" of similar value to give her other son out of thin air?\n\nPart of maturing into an adult is learning to not view things as black and white like children do.

And after the unfortunate death of my first wife, I wasn't even thinking about falling in love, let alone falling in love with a man who already had a child, so it made sense for me to promise him that.But now I have two children, whom I love equally.

Don't split it - your other son is showing his entitled colors. Definitely NTA for considering Carlos. Trying to make them share it. This will involve one child potentially moving out, being disrupted, needing to find a new home for himself and his family, and selling it to split the value if they cannot share.

And if it's not the closest city he works in, than that's even a bigger reason not to be there often.\n\nMaybe he imagined himself to run it from an office since his specialty is finance and hire a ranch manager to handle the day to day? There isn't anything wrong with that. It doesn't mean he values it less than Carlos does. Maybe he does, but we don't know that. Just bc he doesn't physically work it doesn't automatically mean that though.\n\nBesides, Carlos has been compensated the years he's been working on the ranch. He's not doing it for free. People keep posting as if he's been at the ranch putting in time and effort out of the goodness of his heart. Yeah, no. He's been working at mommy's/daddy's business.\n\nI'm not saying Jake's belief he was going to inherit the ranch alone isn't unreasonable. It seems to be, but Carlos shouldn't get it, or get more of it, just because he's been compensated to work there for several years.", "That is some BS roundabout talking in circles which is basically a lie. When that was said, there was no Carlos, so, any reasonable human being would take it as they were getting the ranch - the whole ranch, and the mom meant it that way.\n\nThe reasonable explanation to the immature Jake now is simply that the family changed over the years, so, circumstances changed, which shouldn't have to be explained to any rational, mature adult.\n\nThe OP is making a mistake by leaving it to both of them, though. Jake is jealous of Carlos, and feels animosity towards him now, hence the silent treatment, and feels that mom should have sided with him, as he is the \"real\" son - Jake is going to make co-ownership a nightmare for Carlos. If she wants Jake to have some benefit from it - she should set it up as Carlos will pay x amount of dollars to Jake upon some agreement, with no controlling interest by Jake. 2 people with control of a property that aren't seeing eye to eye is going to be detrimental to the property. You can not have two Chiefs of a tribe, especially when there is conflict, which there will be. Jake is already showing the immature nature of dealing with his feelings and his supposed \"best friend\" and brother Carlos. They WERE best friends, as long as Jake didn't see him as an equal. Jake expected to be his boss when mom passed.", "Was the ranch acquired while you were married to your wife? Inheritance laws can sometimes be tricky with children and assest if one parent dies and the spouse remarries. Jake could contest that he is already due 50% purely from what would have been Inheritance from your wife. It depends on where you live. I presume Carlos is paid well for the work he has done on the ranch and has a free place to live. I am not saying he doesn't deserve to inherit whatever you decide, but I work hard and have made my workplace more profitable doesn't mean I am owed half of it by law. My sister works for my mum's business, she is in the process of selling it. She isn't going to give half of the profit to my sister and my sister doesn't expect her to, although she has helped it to be more successful to some extent she was already paid well for the time she has done that. You are mainly at fault for making a promise like that, people never know what might happen in terms of assets they own.", "You should be angry. IMHO, he doesn't deserve half and it punished Carlos more to have to share what has become his family home (and punishes the grandchild most of all). After all the years cultivating it to thrive and succeed, now he has to take Jake's wants into account, and Jake's mad he has to take other, more deserving, family members into account? No thank you. Jake needs to act like and adult and realize you can do what you wish with your property, especially since you couldn't see the future 20 years ago.", "The more I think about it, the more I want to do the Reddit Reach that maybe Jake has debt or a lifestyle he can\u2019t support or something, and plans to sell the ranch to pay it off. His disproportionate reaction doesn\u2019t make sense, otherwise.", "This was my thought too.  if you make an \"inheritance\" promise to an ONLY child but then have another bio child--would that promise be reasonable?  I think not.", "51/49", "Sell Carlos the business for half value and the money from sale goes to Jake. \nIf it was run down and going broke I doubt Jake would be coming to put money and time into fix it.", "In my country it's easy to give 50,01% to a son and 49,99 to another.", "From my read of the post and comments the OP made, they favor Carlos because he went for an agro major and has been majorly involved in the ranch.\n\nThe OP insists they love them both the same, but that doesn't mean they can't, and don't, favor one more than the other.\n\nOne would imagine that the OP and Carlos are closer with having the ranch in common than the OP is with Jake. I'm sure Jake is aware of it. Jake shouldn't be penalized because he went into finance.\n\nI'm getting very frustrated reading all the posts of people pretty much wanting the OP to cut Jake out and give it all (or most of it) to Carlos because he's lived and worked there the last few years.\n\nNope, he was employee. He was getting paid, and/or he and his family were living free or cheap on the ranch. Again, Jake shouldn't be treated worse than because he chose to go into finance rather than work the ranch.\n\nIf the OP feels that Carlos should retain control of the ranch and Jake not be able to force a sale later like soooo many people are suggesting (and I wouldn't be surprised if the OP agrees), then the OP should SELL it at full fair value to Carlos now and give half that amount to Jake. That way any of the \"sweat equity\" people keep insisting Carlos is putting in would actually being going into his own business that he could do with as he pleases with no worries about Jake messing with it in the future.\n\n...but I can't imagine that would go over well with Jake either.\n\nThere is no winning move here, and the OP might have already lost Jake since he feels sooooo strongly about it and they berated him for it. They'll either all fight about it now while the OP is alive, or Jake and Carlos will probably more viciously when the OP is dead. Jake is going to find it very difficult, if not impossible, to let go of the promise made to him when he was a child. The damage is done. I don't even know how you mitigate it at this point and keep it from becoming awful.\n\nI agree there is something behind Jake's thinking about the ranch and how upset he is about it. I wonder if he resents Carlos for coming in and having to share the OP with them and then watching Carlos get full out adopted (was Jake 100% in favor of this?) by the OP. Then Carlos majors in agriculture and asks to work and live on the ranch. I don't think it's unreasonable for Jake to feel that Carlos was muscling in on things and the OP was favoring Carlos. I can't imagine after several years of Carlos working the ranch, that the OP hasn't become closer to him than Jake. They have the ranch to bond over. Does the OP hang out talking about finance with Jake? Hugely doubtful.\n\nAlso, a step sibling is often VERY different to a child than another biological sibling would be to them. They might very well be best friends now (is that actually true or does Carlos only think it is?), but that doesn't mean there isn't some resentment there. Jake may very well want something he doesn't have to share with Carlos after having to share everything for so many years. Was forced to share the OP, doesn't want to share OP's ranch he was told he was going to get?\n\n...or maybe Jake is irrationally stubborn and even with a biological sibling would still be hanging onto the promise the ranch would he (just) his. There are definitely people who only pass on the bulk of their wealth to their first born. Maybe he actually thought that was what was going to happen?? Maybe that is something that happens in their culture so it's not that crazy of a thought?\n\nIt seems like there HAS to be more than a grown man holding on to a statement made so long ago when of course he's aware the family situation drastically changed to include two new people.\n\nOP needs to have an adult conversation with Jake where they don't berate him to understand what he's thinking/feeling and why and how they might resolve this if possible. For 24 years, he thought he alone was getting the ranch. It might have been stupid of him to believe so, but that is what he believed. He's angry and disappointed right now.", "What a horrible situation! My parents had a terrible marriage and this is exactly what I feared. I didn't care about \"happy home\" or lovey doey step- , half- burdens and I am so unapologetic about it.", "He can do anything he wants, if he is the co-owner of the property.", "We have a family farm owned by multiple relatives.  Land cannot be sold unless all agree.  We have farm meetings and vote on things.  It has been in the family for 200 years.", "If you have to communicate with a 30 year old man that your family dynamic changed, therefore, wills change, you have bigger problems.\n\nthis isn't really about the ranch, anyway. This is about the fact that Jake expected to be treated like the \"real\" son, and his animosity and jealousy of Carlos are now a real problem.\n\nThis was about mom making Carlos his equal. Nope. Not gonna fly. That's why the silent treatment to Carlos, also. BIG mistake leaving them as co-owners now - should be a stipulation that Carlos pay Jake \"x\" but Jake has no controlling interest in the ranch, only financial. he will do whatever he has to to ruin if for Carlos now. Animosity and jealousy are strong, emotional motivators when your own mom chooses someone over you -which isn't what happened, but, it is in Jake's eyes.\n\nWhy do you think he need time alone, and needs to \"process:\" his feelings? That was a HUGE emotional hit and Jake does not appear to be taking it well.", "I mean, I think that the promise was (and should have been) \\*always\\* contingent on additional siblings being added to the family. But that's a pretty difficult factor to explain to a 6-year-old, especially when you haven't even introduced a new partner into the family dynamic yet. OP maybe could have said something about how the plan changed some time over the years, but it's also reasonable to assume that your kid would figure out how life works as he grew up and would expect that a new brother meant his inheritance would get split now.", "I mean, what if OP had had another bio child? Would Jake still be such an ass about it then? OP is NTA. Jake is a massive AH.", "I have a hard time believing Jake remembered this so distinctly from a drive when he was six. I think OP has brought it up since then. He obviously thought of it as his inheritance, so why hasn\u2019t OP clarified things in all this time? Also, what can Carlos expect to receive from his mother\u2019s estate? I don\u2019t believe she isn\u2019t justified in leaving it to both, but with one working it and one in a different field, things may get messy.", "Yeah, but the most-honest thing to say probably would have been that the ranch will go to \"you and any other siblings who might come into our family in the future,\" which of course is the unsaid part that OP meant but a 6-year old can't understand. But that's a hell of a can of worms to open up in conversation with a small child, so I think OP is totally reasonable to just leave it at \"you will get the ranch when you're older.\"", "It doesn't really matter. You can do as you wish with your assets, especially when you take into account the efforts by individuals in your life. A total stranger could come into your life, care for you in time of need while other family is MIA, and be left everything and it s totally legal, and honestly, probably more ethical, and definitely more kind.", "Is there even a place for Jake and his family on the ranch if they wanted it?  Or did Carlos get in first and Jake get cut out?  Jake didn't know that working on the ranch was going to play a part in who inherited the ranch because of OP's earlier promise - it seems a bit of a bait and switch. \n\nHow would Jake's father want the ranch to be settled?  Would he want someone else's grandsons to have his passion project?  How did the ranch come into the family originally?  Who paid for it and when?  What is Carlos' father going to leave to Jake?", "To be clear, I don't think there's a right, or a wrong, way to do a step-adoption, or the associated inheritance. Sometimes it's happy lovey, sometimes it's not. Sometimes step kids aren't the same as bio kids and that's just life. There's no inherent obligation to treat Carlos and Jake exactly the same. \n\nWhere i firmly believe that Jake is the asshole though is that it *didn't even occur to him* that his legally adopted brother of 23 years might be considered equal to him in the eyes of his parents and still expected to be treated as if he were an only child. \n\nThere's no \"hey, what's the sitch now Carlos is around?\" awareness, that didn't even cross Jake's mind. He just treated everything as if 23 years of Carlos never happened. \n\nMy point is if he'd got a new bio brother, it would almost certainly have occurred to him to go 'shit, is this promise still valid?'. It didn't even occur to him that a new adopted brother would be treated as part of the family, too. He just assumed he wasn't a 'real' brother right from the get go. That's kinda a dick move.", "OP is male btw. Speaks in comments about losing his wife, mentioned in the post how Jake was going to inherit his late mother\u2019s estate, and not expecting to fall in love again, especially with a man.", "In Jakes defense, it's still his inheritance and I think it's reasonable to think that the work he was doing to further his career in other areas earned him the right to it. Like, even if Carlos had not been into the ranch either, I feel like both of them would still be entitled to inherit a portion of it as OP's sons. And I could see how Jake could feel like he pursued certain goals because the promise was made that he would have the financial security from this property as a backup, so it would be kind of BS/gaslighting to act years later like the promise was always conditional upon his working on the ranch. Jake might literally have build his life around the idea that he was getting this ranch no matter what he did. That probably instilled a toxic sense of entitlement towards his brother/other people, but he should never have been made to feel like his right to the ranch was not dependent on the amount of work he put into the it or even the addition of new siblings to the family.   \n\n\nOP is NTA at all, but I do think that giving Jake no portion of the Ranch at all would be shitty, too.", "You communicate with the people that you love , that\u2019s her son. If you love someone it doesn\u2019t matter the age you talk , if you prefer to say you\u2019re 30 figure it out people will leave you because they can\u2019t read your mind\n\nNowhere Jake said the \u201creal son\u201d so no point in arguing that point, that\u2019s an assumption .\n\n\nI hope you work for Marvel dude that\u2019s some great writing for people you don\u2019t know.

With or without rent, he's not being favored financially, he's making it \"thrive\" per OP, which benefits the entire family. Jake is the one getting more for less due to Carlos' efforts.", "To be fair to Carlos, I think just working to maintain the ranch would be enough to justify his lack of rent. That's overlooking the fact that it's pretty shitty to treat your best friend/brother as an indentured servant. Carlos's equity is based on his status as OP's child, not to mention the improvements he made to the ranch with his work. Also, it seems like Jake had the equal option to live there rent-free and chose not to so he could pursue a finance career in another place.", "Whether it is totally legal depends a lot on local laws. There are also places where a portion of your inheritance has to go to your children.", "Where? And what evidence do you have of so called \"local laws\". I just did some research and found no evidence of such requirements. I found lots on how to ensure they get it because the opposite is a lot more common.ar least in the  US, a pretty capitalist society, they don't tell you what you must do with you cash.", "Yeah, but the point that she doesn't have to give any to anyone if she doesn't want to is also valid. No one is \"owed* anything, unless you count Carlos' sweat equity.", "I really hate the culture that is ok to lie to children. \n\nThe change of having a new son is a perfectly good reason, the age of Jake is not.", "So?\n\nCarlos is an EMPLOYEE. He's either been getting paid (he asked to WORK at the ranch), and/or he and his family are getting to live there free or cheap.\n\nHe's being compensated.\n\nIt's literally no different than the OP deciding to hire a good ranch manager who turned the ranch around. It's absolutely no different.\n\nJust because Carlos decided to major in agriculture and had a built in job at the ranch doesn't mean that Jake should be treated as less or entitled to receive less because he chose to major in finance and isn't there all the time...bc you know, he has a job in finance a few hours away in the city and doesn't actually live on the ranch. \\*rolls eyes\\*", "Because Jake is going to want to ruin it for Carlos. Jake not talking to Carlos over this is very indicative of animosity towards Carlos now, as Jake expected to be his boss when mom passed. Jake sees himself as the \"real\" son, and the jealousy and animosity he is showing now will  make co-ownership a nightmare. Jake will sell his half to someone else who will cause problems in some sort of way for Carlos.\n\nHe won't simply let Carlos buy him out and live happily ever after. He will want to ruin it for Carlos. He and Carlos were \"best friends\" as long as Carlos wasn't his equal - again, he expected to be his boss when mom passed, so, he didn't see Carlos as an equal. His mom treating Carlos equal to him just sealed the deal that things won't be the same. \n\nThe fact that it is a successful business only makes the sale price better, it's not like he'll be losing anything. He 'll get a lump sum of cash, and the satisfaction of seeing Carlos lose all of his hard work and home, while teaching him that he wasn't equal to him.", "It's always going to be uneven because Jake's mother's assets are going to go to him. But OP is splitting their assets equally between their two sons, which is the fairest thing they can do. \n\nIt's up to them to decide if they are selling/if one is buying the other out after OP passes. Millions of siblings do it each year.", "I mean. This is just an example from [my own country](https://www.government.nl/topics/inheritance-tax/question-and-answer/can-i-disinherit-my-spouse-or-children). Seeing as OP pointed out he is not from the US, US laws obviously do not apply.", "Carlos is more than an employee. Carlos is literally OP's other son who works the farm. Doesn't matter what or how he gets paid he's just as important to OP as Jake. That's all that matters in the end hence why the property is getting split. If OP wants the farm to remain standing and functioning after they pass then yes it would be a much better idea to leave the farm as whole to the child who actually has shown interest since a young age, got a degree centered around farm work, and actually puts in the work to not only maintain it but also make it profitable. That's not say Jake gets nothing but it makes more sense to leave him other things that he could use, like money, that could benefit him because he's just never shown interest in the farm at all.", "Exactly. Which is why OP needs to balance things very carefully. And that\u2019s not taking into account any emotional attachment Jake may have to the ranch. Albeit he doesn\u2019t seem as engaged.", "Maybe Carlos is left the ranch and Jake is left money equal to the selling price of the house.", "I agree that OP is being fair and that they just have to split it and deal with buyouts as normal, but just to clarify the situation... it's a bit hard to tell because OP made a typo, but I think that \\*Carlos\\* is actually going to be left additional inheritance from his mom, not Jake. I believe that OP is Jake's bio mom and Carlos's stepmom. Carlos's mom died, so he will be left an inheritance from her as well as one from his new mother. It sounds like maybe Jake finds it unfair because he doesn't have a separate inheritance, in addition to the ranch, from his own bio dad. Perhaps he feels like the ranch represents his inheritance from both bio parents, and thus feels like Carlos is sharing in his inheritance while Jake doesn't get to share in Carlos's. I dunno, just trying to put myself in those shoes.", "YTA.\n\nYou made a promise which he has clearly not forgotten - by taking this step now, you are likely leaving a lasting and irredeemable impact on Jake and Carlos\u2019 relationship well after you are long gone.\n\nIs Carlo\u2019s father leaving half his assets to Jake? \n\nDoes Carlos pay full rent? Does Carlos have a share of the profit currently? Does Jake? It seems Carlos has inherited the business already - he certainly has the benefit of one. \n\nHow you dealt with this is also poor - for a child who you say is \u201cyour everything\u201d, you are breaking promises and insulting him.\n\nBy taking this step, you have probably reinforced to Jake any feelings he has that Carlos is the preferred child.", "Ok I am so probably get down voted for this but here it goes. \n\nThere are a few things that stood out to me as I was reading your post:\n\n1- you said this use to be a special weekly trip for you and Jack up until he was 6/7. Then you meet Carlos and started to include him. At 6/7 it was probably fun to include hime and show him a round however I wonder if he was starting to feel like his was loosing this special time with you.\n\n2- op said that these trip continued with both boys until jake was 16. Again I wonder if he slacked on going because he felt again op was taking their special time and it just wasn\u2019t as special for him to go. I also wonder if maybe op felt like the third wheel because op seems to have more in common with the stepson then Jack.\n\n3- back to Jake quiting at 16. My child played football. Football games when my child played where always on the Friday nights.  so if you where going to the ranch with Carlos weekly who was going to watch and cheer on Jake at football games.\n\n4- back to op and Carlos continue going on this trip with op every weekend when Jake stopped. This leads me to wonder if they have a lot more in common.\n\nSo here is my Reddit leap. I wonder op if by not meaning too you started to push your sone away at 6/7 by stopping special weekly trips the 2 of you by being Carlos every time. I am not in no way saying Carlos should have been included but maybe you should have picked random weekend to show that although you love Carlos that the bond you share with Jake was still there. Because YOU choose to marry Carlos\u2019s father and bring another child in. NOT Jake to him at 6/7 he just sees this new KId taking over something special he shared with his only parent left.\n\nNow let touch on the fact that i see you and Carlos having so much in common that maybe Jake felt like he was a third wheel so he stopped going on this trip.  So he started playing a sport where games are weekend centered and instead of watching and cheering him on you just continue to build a bond with the stepson.\n\nSo now it leads me to now. You let Carlos move, live and improve the ranch with out remembering a promise you made that it would eventually be Jakes. I am not saying you where not within your rights to do this. However I think you should have at least had a conversation with Jake about Carlos moving there and settling with a family. Explained that you know you made promises to him but when those promises where made you didn\u2019t realize how things would change. But you didn\u2019t. Again I think this was because you have more in common with Carlos and your sons was yet again a second thought or a third wheel. \n\nSo now let\u2019s talk about the real issue. Everyone is focusing on the fact that Jake is being entitled and shouldn\u2019t expect to inherit the whole ranch. I am looking at this differed. \n\n\nYou just proved to your son 30 years later what he always thought. He was loosing his only parent. He grew up feeling replaced and now you showed him that by not keeping a promise to a 6 year old. Apparently a promise that meant so much to a 6 year old that he held on to that promise for 30 years. Yet again in jakes mind you yet again picked Carlos over him like you did when you went to the ranch with Carlos over going to football games. \n\n\nYour son realized 16 years ago that he lost his only parent. Now you just sent that message and prove what he always feared.  I believe that\u2019s why he is mad at not only you but his stepbrother. And no your husband isn\u2019t getting involved because his son is benefiting from your decision with out looking bad.\n\n\nListen I don\u2019t think you did anything in malleus. However I do think you have damaged your relationship with your son. Especially by saint he is been ridiculous by still expecting this promos to be upheld instead of talking to him. Validating his feelings and explaining to him things have changed. And I also believe by doing this you have damaged what seems to be a good relationship with your son and your stepson.", "YTA and you better be 1000% sure your husband plans to divide his assets equally too.
