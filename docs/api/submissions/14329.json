HOWEVER, you could have worded it better. I think it would be good if you apologized how you came across and explained your reasons: you have another son, Carlos is taking care of the ranch, and he has a right because he lives there and obviously loves the ranch.\n\nKeep your distance, though, because it is obvious he is hurt. If you want, write a letter to explain this. But dismissing his hurt as a \"this is ridiculous\" is not the way to talk about this.", "Nta, it is insane to think a promise someone made to you at 6 will be lifelong.

The ranch would still be Jake's, he'd just have to split it with his brother -- who, based on what you have said, has put more effort into it than him.

Hopefully with time he may come around but don't push it. Give him space for now.", "YTA.

Personally, I think you\u2019re doing a huge disservice to Carlos by splitting ownership between he and Jake. Talk to Jake and ask him what he planned to do with the ranch if you gave it to him and see what he says - but first apologize for the way you responded to him. Carlos deserves full ownership of the ranch at this point. It\u2019s his home, his family\u2019s home, and possibly his full-time job?

You\u2019re not like that woman who made her twelve year old to pay off the swimming pool once the daughter got a job.

Jake show no interested on the ranch and might sell it off for profit.", "YTA I know at the time you were thinking you wouldn't have another kid so it wouldn't be a problem, but time changed things. Since the boys are best friends you could have broached this as \"I was intending on splitting it between the two of you how do you feel about that?\" He might have been ok with it if you had an actual conversation with him about it, and heard him out.

Its understandable that you would change your mind given that Carlos asked to move to the ranch and all and has been clearly involved while Jake hasn\u2019t. You\u2019re not the AH for that. I agree with that decision and I think you are actually still being generous to still spilt the ranch when Jake seemingly has done no work and Carols has. To just respond to Jake that he\u2019s insane for thinking its the same though is really\u2026wow.

A promise is a promise.", "YTA not for your decision, but for how you responded to Jake and basically didn't communicate with him at all. Both he and you remember it as a promise to him - he obviously feels betrayed by you reneging on that. Go apologize and explain your decision in a mature, adult way.", "YTA for making a promise to a 6 year old child, you had no intention in keeping.\n\nSo Jake isn't getting anything? I can see why he is annoyed, I would be too. What's he getting? Debt because he will have to buy his own house and find his own place to live since he is getting nothing.\n\nThat conversation when he was 6 meant a lot to him and very little to you. He feels betrayed. From his eyes he is thinking, my mom loves her husband and step son more than me. And since you are giving your new family everything over your son, he has good reason to think so.", "YTA. You should not make promises that you won\u2019t keep. While Carlos certainly has earned half of the ranch, Jake has a right to feel hurt. You promised him something and are acting as if he\u2019s crazy for trusting your promise.", "N T A for the decision itself, but light YTA for how you responded to him (which is the question you're actually asking here). I think you could have handled this a lot better. You didn't have Carlos in your life when you made the promise, right? And everything that happened thereafter with Jake and Carlson's respective relationships with the ranch hasn't happened yet either. You could have explained to Jake why your thinking changed, and said you didn't realize it still mattered to him because he hasn't shown much interest in the ranch or brought up that promise in the intervening years.\n\nPromises like that, even made offhand, can be very powerful to a small child. He's grown now, of course, but I don't think it's completely shocking that his lingering 6-year-old certainty about it might have meant he hadn't really considered it practically, or even as a question at all. I think splitting the ranch between him and Carlos is more than fair to him, but going straight to \"you're being ridiculous\" was not a great way to go about the reality check.", "An explanation of what was promised would help determine if you\u2019re NTA/YTA?? The promise that Jake would get the farm 100?", "Maybe Jake thinks he couldn\u2019t really go to the ranch that much because he\u2019d get in the way of Carlos and his family and might not be fully welcome? Does Carlos pay rent and/or get paid? Are you giving one son free housing and/or other benefits? Maybe Jake feels pushed out, like you might prefer Carlos to him?\n\nWas this discussed with Carlos? If so, he didn\u2019t think giving his brother/best friend a heads up? Did Carlos know about the promise? Did he plan to work the ranch with the hope the promise would be broken?\n\nWill there be restrictions on dividing the property? Jake will have an asset he won\u2019t feel comfortable using, especially now that Carlos definitely owns half? But Jake will still be liable for taxes and other liabilities? What if expenses need to be paid? Jake has to pay? Will he receive income from the ranch?  What if Carlos is hostile to Jake when he comes to the ranch? What if Carlos and Jake disagree about how to run the ranch?\n\nDid Jake make any plans about his future, thinking he would inherit the ranch? Did he plan that to be his kids\u2019 education fund? \n\nYou can\u2019t make a promise, let people make significant decisions based on that promise, then act shocked when they are justifiably angry when the promise was meaningless. \n\nThis is a mess and you\u2019ve set your kids up to argue and possibly ruin their relationship, whether now or after you\u2019re gone. All of this should have been discussed with both sons, but probably with Jake first because of the promise.

I think that\u2019s something to take into consideration.", "It\u2019s not mind changing or lies though\u2026 the ranch will still be Jake\u2019s, along with his brother.

OP said the ranch would be his and it will be just not solely Jakes.\n\nSaying \"one day this will be yours\" or \"i will leave the ranch to you\" does not mean sole/exclusive ownership. \n\nSo OP is still fulfilling their promise, because thw ranch will be left to Jake and he will own it, just with someone else.", "That is a very good point!", "Yes. It\u2019s very unlikely that Carlos has been getting a competitive salary for the work he\u2019s put in, so he\u2019s owed a lot. And that would also give him control, which is important since he\u2019s the one who\u2019ll know how to run it.\n\nJake isn\u2019t a good friend to Carlos if he wants to take away what Carlos has earned. Nor is he a good brother if he doesn\u2019t recognize that OP has two sons now, not just the one son that the long-ago promise was made to.", "She adopted Carlos - 1/2 is totally fair.

This could be a reach, but the reaction to not getting the ranch could be a confirmation in his mind that he is not special to you. Could be worth exploring in conversation?", "why did carlos go into agronomy? did ou promise him the ranch too?", "You should also bring up that the ranch 20 years ago is very different to the ranch of today, that a self-sustaining piece of property was one thing, but it is now a profitable business. The business is in large part due to Carlos, and giving it solely to Jake would be shitty\n\nMaybe write him an email so you can get it all down but he doesn\u2019t have to interact with it or you until he wants to - that way it will be up to him", "I would seriously ask Carlos if he wants the ranch.\nIt sounds like it's solely because of him it's now profitable.\nI think you should figure out a way to get Carlos the ranch and split the rest.", "1) he still gets half the ranch, his brother gets the other half\n2) he has no real interest in the ranch and pursued a completely different path in life\n3) his brother had turned said ranch into a profitable business, and absolutely deserves part of that ranch (if not all)\n\nOP is NTA, but the dude in finance thinking lion king rules apply and he can cut out his brother certainly is.", "Lion King? Really? Okay. Simba was the heir apparent to a kingdom. \n\nJake didn\u2019t build his life around the ranch. He didn\u2019t care about it and got a degree in finance.\n\nNot all promises are lifelong. Some promises aren\u2019t even real when they are made. Inane promises made to a child are not real.", "So let's talk pragmatically. This is Carlos place of residence and business. Carlos can do whatever he wants on the ranch. \n\nCan Jake do the same? Say he wanted to keep a car collection or wanted to build a house on the property or wanted to add a coy pond. I assume the ranch has a house, what if you wanted to move into it?\n\nHow much can Jake actually do on the property?", "It's a little weird that he went into soil management and crop production. It's almost like he had his eyes on the ranch or was told he would be getting it by the OP\n\nEDIT: agronomy is the science of soil management and crop production", "You might be misinterpreting what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that lets say the ranch was worth $200k before Carlos took over. After his years of building it up, it's worth $400k. Jake gets to split the $200k that it was originally worth before Carlos put in the work. Carlos inherits half the original value plus everything he's built since he took over.", "Yes. Especially since, despite him having counted on that long-ago promise, Jake may really be seeing dollar signs not sentimental attachment.", "Yeah, sure, I've heard S Lazy H, Carlos is cool, half is fine, I'm talking to the person I replied to. Keep your promises to your children. And all promises are forever.\n\nI mean, I guess if I have to address it- They should have talked to Josh first, they should have said \"we know it was yours, we said that when we had only one son, look at how Carlos has loved that ranch, we're passing it on, but you still get a fair share.\" He wants to nab it all, he's an asshole. But OP is definitely an asshole for thinking its \"ridiculous\" that he would remember or expect that promise to be upheld. It was a promise of a home in posterity to a child of your blood. That's like- the whole point of human society up to this point.", "\"This, our property, real estate, will one day be given to you to live in\" is not an inane promise made to a child, its the original point of property. It's the whole thing we've been doing as a species for 6000 years since we invented it, working, making homes, giving those homes to our children. Until the 20th century, anyway. But still a pretty big part of the whole thing.\n\nAgain, agreeing Carlos should get the ranch and its perfectly reasonable to expect that him taking it over and Jake ignoring it, as well as the natural compromises that come with adoption, significantly alter the circumstances of that promise in ways that are perfectly fair. But don't make inane promises, and keep your promises to your children. If any promise isn't real, to you, no promise is real, from you. They will learn.\n\nEDIT: The point of mentioning the Lion King is that a 6-year old understands what \"This will all be yours someday\" is and means, because they have seen the Lion King. They understand that promise has weight, it is the circle of life, the inheritance of parent to child, their land, their place. When they said that to Josh, he almost surely thought of Mufasa and Simba and \"everything the light touches,\" 6-year old boy that he was, and that meant something to him.", "Exactly\u2026. I Have 3 children and I could say to any one of them \u201cthis property will be yours one day\u201d and it\u2019s true. It\u2019ll be split 3 ways and all three can claim ownership of it. That\u2019s not a failed promise.", "Seriously?\n\nLook, some promises are stupid. Some promises are short-sighted and ultimately not reasonable to keep. (Frankly some promises should never have been made, but I can understand why OP made the promise they did if they hadn\u2019t expected to have additional children. And since Carlos is adopted, he IS her additional child.)\n\nKeeping a promise made when she only had one child but now has two, and means the one child who has put in YEARS of work and turned it into a successful business now gets no part of it would be cruel.\n\nThe fact that one son has watched his brother work for years to make it successful all while believing that brother would get nothing is pretty damn fucked up.", "So she should give what is likely the vast majority of her estate to one son due to an ill-advised, spur of the moment promise to a 6 year old even though she now has another son,  one who haa put years of sweat equity into it and greatly increased the value of the business through his efforts? And she's supposed to just conjure up \"something else\" of similar value to give her other son out of thin air?\n\nPart of maturing into an adult is learning to not view things as black and white like children do. Her son needs to do this.  Circumstances change and people make mistakes. Does he expect couples to not ever divorce too, since they made a promise to love each other until death?\n\nExpecting his brother to be basically left out of the will just cuz  he wasn't around when the promise was made is totally unfair.", "Koi is the fish. Coy is pretending to be shy to make yourself look more attractive.", "Or, I don\u2019t know, he developed an interest in that area after going to the ranch for years.", "He's been going to the ranch every weekend since he was 7 and you think it's a 'little weird' he developed and pursued an interest in farming?", "Or maybe he saw the ranch and wanted to learn more about how to make it better. Kinda like how kids learn the family business.", "MY HERO", "Given his degree in finance, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nYes, fiance would be of some benefit to a business, but Carlos's degree is more beneficial to the business since Jake wouldn't know what the ranch needs to have brought so it can make the money Jake wants/needs.", "Any lifelong promise made to a 6 year old is inane. They are by definition not real. \n\nWe also tell them Santa is real.", "I\u2019m not buying that.  Carlos wanted to live on the ranch and probably has been living there rent free.

And if Carlos has been living there rent free, and supporting his family off the ranch, I have a problem with giving him so much credit.  YTA.", ">and ultimately not reasonable to keep.\n\n not the important ones. \"I promise we will go to the park this weekend\" is unreasonable to keep if there is a tornado outside.

She made it to a small child.", "This is why YTA", "Curses. What a dastardly enemy.", "Here\u2019s a normal promise you make to your child. \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the monster under your bed, I\u2019ll always be there to protect you\u201d\n\nBecause the point is to make them feel better in the moment because you will, in fact, not be always there to protect them.", "Reddit, man.\n\nSometimes the responses can be fantastic and empathetic, thoughtful and not holding back.\n\nAnd sometimes they are completely disconnected from any reality of how to treat people.\n\nAs if being a promise means it\u2019s always ethical.", "\\>\\_> From the monster under his bed? Surely he'll be sleeping in the same house as one of you for at least as long as he believes there's a monster under there. That one feels... real easy to keep. If you ever didn't come in when he was scared of the monster, and check (or at least, remind him monsters don't exist and he doesn't have to be afraid), that would surely be hurtful to him and he'd feel betrayed, right? So the monster may not be real, but the promise is, and you mean to keep it, presumably? And likewise, you would hopefully be there to protect your child, such as you might, for your own entire life, though the definition of protect may vary wildly across that life."]}
