In one of this trips to the ranch I off handedly promised him that one day, the ranch would be his. \n\nI met Carlos's dad when Jake and Carlos were 6. I married him a year later. Both Jake and Carlos used to go with me almost every week with me to the ranch, depending if they were busy. When they were both 16, Jake picked up football pretty seriously, so he couldn't go to the ranch so much anymore. Carlos continued to go with me until 18, when he went to college and and studied engineering in agronomy (don't know if this is the correct translation). Jake got a degree in finance. \n\nAfter college, Carlos asked me if he could move to the ranch to work there full time. Of course I agreed. That was 8 years ago. Since then, he has made great improvements and I can confidently say he is the biggest reason as to why the ranch is thriving. He also now has a wife and a little girl who live there full time. On the other hand, Jake didn't really show any interest towards the ranch, he maybe goes once every four months. \n\nI was having dinner with Jake the other day. We were reminiscing a dear family friend who recently passed away without a will and how his family is now looking towards a long process of litigation because they couldn't agree about how to split his stuff. I said \"good thing that I already decided mine\". Jake was surprised, and asked me how I'm going to split my net worth. I told him that the stuff from her mom was going to him, and the ranch was to be split between Carlos and him and the house will stay with my husband.  \n\nJake then asked me If I remembered the promise I made to him when he was 6. I said I did. Then he asked me why I'm not honoring that promise. I was shocked. I asked him if he was being serious and he said yes. Then I said \"It's insane that you are expecting me to do that. You're being ridiculous\".  He was not happy. We finished dinner quickly after that, and when I told him goodbye he said to me to not contact him for a while because he had to sort out his feelings about this. \n\nThat was a week ago and he hasn't returned any of my calls.

Carlos has sweat equity in the ranch, at this point.  You would be justified in leaving the ranch to Carlos alone.   But you are splitting the ranch so Jake gets half of it.  That's fair, and it's not breaking a promise.  If Jake wants the entire ranch, he can buy out Carlos' half, which Carlos has EARNED.", "OP, make sure your attorney has an airtight will with your wants clear as crystal. \n\nNTA", "Does Jake want to get nothing? Because this is how he gets nothing.\n\nNTA", "NTA. when you had another son he should have realized then that things would be different.", "NTA. Not sure if the people calling Y T A have kids, cause it\u2019s weird for them to be saying you should be keeping the promise to give a whole ranch to a 6 yr old child (You we\u2019re obviously being sweet in the moment). Not to mention you didn\u2019t have two kids at the time.", "ESH - you handled the conversation very badly. You should sit down and talk to both of your sons and try to clear the air now. \n\nHaving said that,  you are free to distribute your estate how you choose and both your sons need to understand that.  You made a stupid, shortsighted promise when you shouldn't have but circumstances are different now and you have two sons.", "You hear stories like this a lot. Ranch gets passed down. 1 child gave up their lives to work it the other ran off to the city. When the parents die the ranch ends up split and then it\u2019s bought by a developer and turned into subdivisions. Corb lund has an amazing song about it. \u201cS lazy h\u201d. So basically. You give it to both of them. Jake will cash out Carlos will have to sell to pay it off and the ranch is gone. Jake forfeit any claim when he abandoned it. You need to ask yourself where you want the ranch to be in 50 years. With your grand kids or turned into a cookie cutter subdivision.", "NTA - you made that promise when you had 1 son. Now you have 2 sons.\n\nDoes the ranch make profit? Is it a business?", "NTA because Carlos exists in your life and he has taken care of the ranch. He has a right to it. HOWEVER, you could have worded it better. I think it would be good if you apologized how you came across and explained your reasons: you have another son, Carlos is taking care of the ranch, and he has a right because he lives there and obviously loves the ranch.\n\nKeep your distance, though, because it is obvious he is hurt. If you want, write a letter to explain this. But dismissing his hurt as a \"this is ridiculous\" is not the way to talk about this.", "Nta, it is insane to think a promise someone made to you at 6 will be lifelong. Especially if he just sees the ranch as an asset and your other child sees it as a livelihood. Quite immature of Jake imo.", "NTA. The ranch would still be Jake's, he'd just have to split it with his brother -- who, based on what you have said, has put more effort into it than him. Also he's a grown ass person and has shown significantly much less interest in the ranch, according to you. I'm sure he can get over being told the truth (that he's being ridiculous).", "NTA. Rather than saying it's insane of him to expect you to honour the promise you should've told him that he has displayed zero interest in the ranch so your promise is null and void. He should be happy you aren't giving the ranch completely to Carlos.", "YTA *for calling your son ridiculous and saying that him wanting you to honor your promise is insane*\n\nYou are N T A for deciding to split the property between both your sons considering the promise was made before your second son entered the family.", "NTA first, he is still getting the ranch- he will have shared ownership. Second, circumstances change; you have two sons now, one of whom put a lot of sweat equity into the ranch.", "NTA. Remember it\u2019s your ranch. Him raking that up is a cheap trick. Maybe you won\u2019t even own it when you pass. It\u2019s all utter nonsense.", "Yes YTA for calling your son ridiculous for expecting you to keep your promise. \n\nYou could have discussed it and made your case as to why you felt it was okay to break your promise, but nope, you just called him ridiculous for having believed you would keep your word.", "A bit YTA-  you changed your mind without talking about it to the kids. It sounds like Carlos has put a lot of sweat equity into the ranch. Is he being paid for that, or is it assumed to be part of his inheritance?  \n\nJake hasn\u2019t put in that work, and he still assumes he gets everything. \n\nYou need to absolutely sort this out now or it\u2019s gonna be a fight when you die. Be honest with everyone-  because the lies are the cruelest part.", "In answer to your actual question YTA. NTA for dividing the will fairly, but Ahole territory for belittling him like that.  Would he have expected this promise to be upheld if you had birthed other children as opposed to adoption? Seems to me he considers Carlos less than for this reason. Hopefully with time he may come around but don't push it. Give him space for now.", "YTA. You made a promise that meant a lot to him, and when for good reason reneging on it, you called him insane and ridiculous. An explanation was warranted, not name-calling and belittling.\n\nYou\u2019re not TA for how you want to divide your assets, just the way you handled this conversation.", "NTA, but it\u2019s close - Jake hasn\u2019t been interested in the ranch since he was a teenager. In the meantime, Carlos has joined the family, gotten a degree related to running the ranch, has been improving the ranch for the last 8 years, and it\u2019s his family home now. \n\nJake had no business asking you how you were splitting your net worth and you shouldn\u2019t have answered him. But the way you answered him was unacceptable and of course he\u2019s angry at being called names but he has no reason to be angry at Carlos or to be avoiding him. Personally, I think you\u2019re doing a huge disservice to Carlos by splitting ownership between he and Jake. Talk to Jake and ask him what he planned to do with the ranch if you gave it to him and see what he says - but first apologize for the way you responded to him. Carlos deserves full ownership of the ranch at this point. It\u2019s his home, his family\u2019s home, and possibly his full-time job? Redo your inheritance documents and don\u2019t tell them how you\u2019re dividing your assets.", "INFO - Are Jake and Carlos getting aprox. equal dollar value proportions of the estate.", "Soft YTA. You are in your right to decide where your property goes, but you should sit him down and explain why it\u2019s going somewhere different than where you promised it would go", "YTA for discounting your son's feelings about a promise that was clearly important enough to him that he remembered it over 20 years later. You have every right to split the property how you want, but you owe him an apology for calling him ridiculous and not understanding how much weight he put on the promise.", "Wait, why is Carlos is mad? Are we missing something????\n\n\nI want to say NTA.  \n\n\nAnd those calling you the A-hole need to stop.  You\u2019re not like that woman who made her twelve year old to pay off the swimming pool once the daughter got a job.  You can\u2019t make a verbal agreement with a child unless they shown interest through their life.  Jake show no interested on the ranch and might sell it off for profit.", "YTA I know at the time you were thinking you wouldn't have another kid so it wouldn't be a problem, but time changed things. Since the boys are best friends you could have broached this as \"I was intending on splitting it between the two of you how do you feel about that?\" He might have been ok with it if you had an actual conversation with him about it, and heard him out. But instead you blindsided him then belittled him! \n\nI don't know what your solution is since now you've done the damage. How does your husband feel about it?", "Personally YTA. I have a friend who \u201cbought\u201d her parent\u2019s house for a dollar when she was a young kid. Her parents have it in their will that she gets the house and her sisters don\u2019t have legal entitlement to that property. Currently one of her sisters lives in the house and before she makes any changes to the property she has to ask their parents, and my friend. \n\nDon\u2019t make promises to kids you don\u2019t intend to keep, kids will always remember.", "YTA you broke a promise, and more than just that, you've done so in as brazen and hurtful a way as you could. \n\n\nYou remember the deal you made, but you just decided you dont have to actually live up to what you promised your child and told him that directly.", "YTA. A promise is a promise. Why would you even consider breaking it?", "YTA\n\nthats why you dont make promises to children, they ALWAYS remember that shit. You set yourself up 20 years ago, now don't run from it", "ESH he should have realized as an adult that things were different as you have 2 sons now BUT why on earth did you wait til he was 30 to tell him. And clearly your words when he was 6yo were taken seriously by him so you were out of line to call it ridiculous!", "YTA for how you handled it. Its understandable that you would change your mind given that Carlos asked to move to the ranch and all and has been clearly involved while Jake hasn\u2019t. You\u2019re not the AH for that. I agree with that decision and I think you are actually still being generous to still spilt the ranch when Jake seemingly has done no work and Carols has. To just respond to Jake that he\u2019s insane for thinking its the same though is really\u2026wow. Explaining the fact that Carols has been very involved when he hasn\u2019t I think would have gone a long way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
