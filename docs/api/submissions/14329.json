Both Jake and Carlos used to go with me almost every week with me to the ranch, depending if they were busy.

Carlos continued to go with me until 18, when he went to college and and studied engineering in agronomy (don't know if this is the correct translation). Jake got a degree in finance. \n\nAfter college, Carlos asked me if he could move to the ranch to work there full time. Of course I agreed. That was 8 years ago.

I said I did. Then he asked me why I'm not honoring that promise. I was shocked. I asked him if he was being serious and he said yes. Then I said \"It's insane that you are expecting me to do that.

HOWEVER, you could have worded it better. I think it would be good if you apologized how you came across and explained your reasons: you have another son, Carlos is taking care of the ranch, and he has a right because he lives there and obviously loves the ranch.\n\nKeep your distance, though, because it is obvious he is hurt. If you want, write a letter to explain this. But dismissing his hurt as a \"this is ridiculous\" is not the way to talk about this.", "Nta, it is insane to think a promise someone made to you at 6 will be lifelong.

The ranch would still be Jake's, he'd just have to split it with his brother -- who, based on what you have said, has put more effort into it than him.

Hopefully with time he may come around but don't push it. Give him space for now.", "YTA.

Personally, I think you\u2019re doing a huge disservice to Carlos by splitting ownership between he and Jake. Talk to Jake and ask him what he planned to do with the ranch if you gave it to him and see what he says - but first apologize for the way you responded to him. Carlos deserves full ownership of the ranch at this point. It\u2019s his home, his family\u2019s home, and possibly his full-time job?

You\u2019re not like that woman who made her twelve year old to pay off the swimming pool once the daughter got a job.

Jake show no interested on the ranch and might sell it off for profit.", "YTA I know at the time you were thinking you wouldn't have another kid so it wouldn't be a problem, but time changed things. Since the boys are best friends you could have broached this as \"I was intending on splitting it between the two of you how do you feel about that?\" He might have been ok with it if you had an actual conversation with him about it, and heard him out.

Its understandable that you would change your mind given that Carlos asked to move to the ranch and all and has been clearly involved while Jake hasn\u2019t. You\u2019re not the AH for that. I agree with that decision and I think you are actually still being generous to still spilt the ranch when Jake seemingly has done no work and Carols has. To just respond to Jake that he\u2019s insane for thinking its the same though is really\u2026wow.

You could have explained to Jake why your thinking changed, and said you didn't realize it still mattered to him because he hasn't shown much interest in the ranch or brought up that promise in the intervening years.\n\nPromises like that, even made offhand, can be very powerful to a small child. He's grown now, of course, but I don't think it's completely shocking that his lingering 6-year-old certainty about it might have meant he hadn't really considered it practically, or even as a question at all. I think splitting the ranch between him and Carlos is more than fair to him, but going straight to \"you're being ridiculous\" was not a great way to go about the reality check.", "An explanation of what was promised would help determine if you\u2019re NTA/YTA??

What I'm saying is that lets say the ranch was worth $200k before Carlos took over. After his years of building it up, it's worth $400k. Jake gets to split the $200k that it was originally worth before Carlos put in the work. Carlos inherits half the original value plus everything he's built since he took over.", "Yes.

But OP is definitely an asshole for thinking its \"ridiculous\" that he would remember or expect that promise to be upheld. It was a promise of a home in posterity to a child of your blood. That's like- the whole point of human society up to this point.", "\"This, our property, real estate, will one day be given to you to live in\" is not an inane promise made to a child, its the original point of property. It's the whole thing we've been doing as a species for 6000 years since we invented it, working, making homes, giving those homes to our children. Until the 20th century, anyway. But still a pretty big part of the whole thing.\n\nAgain, agreeing Carlos should get the ranch and its perfectly reasonable to expect that him taking it over and Jake ignoring it, as well as the natural compromises that come with adoption, significantly alter the circumstances of that promise in ways that are perfectly fair. But don't make inane promises, and keep your promises to your children. If any promise isn't real, to you, no promise is real, from you. They will learn.\n\nEDIT: The point of mentioning the Lion King is that a 6-year old understands what \"This will all be yours someday\" is and means, because they have seen the Lion King. They understand that promise has weight, it is the circle of life, the inheritance of parent to child, their land, their place.

And since Carlos is adopted, he IS her additional child.)\n\nKeeping a promise made when she only had one child but now has two, and means the one child who has put in YEARS of work and turned it into a successful business now gets no part of it would be cruel.\n\nThe fact that one son has watched his brother work for years to make it successful all while believing that brother would get nothing is pretty damn fucked up.", "So she should give what is likely the vast majority of her estate to one son due to an ill-advised, spur of the moment promise to a 6 year old even though she now has another son,  one who haa put years of sweat equity into it and greatly increased the value of the business through his efforts? And she's supposed to just conjure up \"something else\" of similar value to give her other son out of thin air?\n\nPart of maturing into an adult is learning to not view things as black and white like children do.

And after the unfortunate death of my first wife, I wasn't even thinking about falling in love, let alone falling in love with a man who already had a child, so it made sense for me to promise him that.But now I have two children, whom I love equally.

It shouldn't matter any more than any other person being hired who did a good job and made the ranch worth more.", "really? why is it not possible that jake sees the ranch as his parent\u2019s love rather than just dollar signs? \n\nthere are many stories on Reddit where op\u2019s one daughter is a legit millionaire and the other middle class/ working class and when op divides the inheritance unequitably, giving the poorer one more and then op gets bashed. It\u2019s cause the parents love is measured by the inheritance that they get ( at least by op\u2019s kids)", "It's cool bro. Good luck with the graveyard shift.", "Unless Carlos buys out the other half? Granted that's still dependant on whether or not Jake would sell it to him, but it wouldn't make sense to not if that were the case, even if Jake is still bitter about the whole thing.", "What the hell did you read? Carlos took a degree in 'engineering in agronomy' (agronomy is the science of soil management and crop production), and then *when he finished his degree* worked on the ranch, making use of his qualifications and knowledge to improve the ranch. Nowhere does it say he (Carlos) gave up his engineering career to work on the farm.", "I\u2019m describing his state of mind and comprehension at age 6. That\u2019s why I also added that it should have crossed his mind sometime in the last decade (that his initial expectation of sole ownership may not be realistic).", "No reason for Jake to sell anyway. He owns 50 percent of a profitable business. Why sell?", "In which case OP should leave Carlos enough money to be able to afford that. If Carlos has to fund it himself, and Jake still gets other inheritance, it\u2019s still uneven.", "So if OP had had a second biological child you would still expect the first son to inherit everything?", "Who knows, just a hypothetical.", "True, but then the inheritance is uneven if Carlos is left more money in order to do that, because what if Jake doesn't sell?\n\nIt's a bitch of a situation."]}
