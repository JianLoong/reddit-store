Both Jake and Carlos used to go with me almost every week with me to the ranch, depending if they were busy.

Carlos continued to go with me until 18, when he went to college and and studied engineering in agronomy (don't know if this is the correct translation). Jake got a degree in finance. \n\nAfter college, Carlos asked me if he could move to the ranch to work there full time. Of course I agreed. That was 8 years ago.

I said I did. Then he asked me why I'm not honoring that promise. I was shocked. I asked him if he was being serious and he said yes. Then I said \"It's insane that you are expecting me to do that.

HOWEVER, you could have worded it better. I think it would be good if you apologized how you came across and explained your reasons: you have another son, Carlos is taking care of the ranch, and he has a right because he lives there and obviously loves the ranch.\n\nKeep your distance, though, because it is obvious he is hurt. If you want, write a letter to explain this. But dismissing his hurt as a \"this is ridiculous\" is not the way to talk about this.", "Nta, it is insane to think a promise someone made to you at 6 will be lifelong.

The ranch would still be Jake's, he'd just have to split it with his brother -- who, based on what you have said, has put more effort into it than him.

Hopefully with time he may come around but don't push it. Give him space for now.", "YTA.

Personally, I think you\u2019re doing a huge disservice to Carlos by splitting ownership between he and Jake. Talk to Jake and ask him what he planned to do with the ranch if you gave it to him and see what he says - but first apologize for the way you responded to him. Carlos deserves full ownership of the ranch at this point. It\u2019s his home, his family\u2019s home, and possibly his full-time job?

You\u2019re not like that woman who made her twelve year old to pay off the swimming pool once the daughter got a job.

Jake show no interested on the ranch and might sell it off for profit.", "YTA I know at the time you were thinking you wouldn't have another kid so it wouldn't be a problem, but time changed things. Since the boys are best friends you could have broached this as \"I was intending on splitting it between the two of you how do you feel about that?\" He might have been ok with it if you had an actual conversation with him about it, and heard him out.

Its understandable that you would change your mind given that Carlos asked to move to the ranch and all and has been clearly involved while Jake hasn\u2019t. You\u2019re not the AH for that. I agree with that decision and I think you are actually still being generous to still spilt the ranch when Jake seemingly has done no work and Carols has. To just respond to Jake that he\u2019s insane for thinking its the same though is really\u2026wow.

You could have explained to Jake why your thinking changed, and said you didn't realize it still mattered to him because he hasn't shown much interest in the ranch or brought up that promise in the intervening years.\n\nPromises like that, even made offhand, can be very powerful to a small child. He's grown now, of course, but I don't think it's completely shocking that his lingering 6-year-old certainty about it might have meant he hadn't really considered it practically, or even as a question at all. I think splitting the ranch between him and Carlos is more than fair to him, but going straight to \"you're being ridiculous\" was not a great way to go about the reality check.", "An explanation of what was promised would help determine if you\u2019re NTA/YTA??

What I'm saying is that lets say the ranch was worth $200k before Carlos took over. After his years of building it up, it's worth $400k. Jake gets to split the $200k that it was originally worth before Carlos put in the work. Carlos inherits half the original value plus everything he's built since he took over.", "Yes.

But OP is definitely an asshole for thinking its \"ridiculous\" that he would remember or expect that promise to be upheld. It was a promise of a home in posterity to a child of your blood. That's like- the whole point of human society up to this point.", "\"This, our property, real estate, will one day be given to you to live in\" is not an inane promise made to a child, its the original point of property. It's the whole thing we've been doing as a species for 6000 years since we invented it, working, making homes, giving those homes to our children. Until the 20th century, anyway. But still a pretty big part of the whole thing.\n\nAgain, agreeing Carlos should get the ranch and its perfectly reasonable to expect that him taking it over and Jake ignoring it, as well as the natural compromises that come with adoption, significantly alter the circumstances of that promise in ways that are perfectly fair. But don't make inane promises, and keep your promises to your children. If any promise isn't real, to you, no promise is real, from you. They will learn.\n\nEDIT: The point of mentioning the Lion King is that a 6-year old understands what \"This will all be yours someday\" is and means, because they have seen the Lion King. They understand that promise has weight, it is the circle of life, the inheritance of parent to child, their land, their place.

And since Carlos is adopted, he IS her additional child.)\n\nKeeping a promise made when she only had one child but now has two, and means the one child who has put in YEARS of work and turned it into a successful business now gets no part of it would be cruel.\n\nThe fact that one son has watched his brother work for years to make it successful all while believing that brother would get nothing is pretty damn fucked up.", "So she should give what is likely the vast majority of her estate to one son due to an ill-advised, spur of the moment promise to a 6 year old even though she now has another son,  one who haa put years of sweat equity into it and greatly increased the value of the business through his efforts? And she's supposed to just conjure up \"something else\" of similar value to give her other son out of thin air?\n\nPart of maturing into an adult is learning to not view things as black and white like children do.

Don't split it - your other son is showing his entitled colors. Definitely NTA for considering Carlos. Trying to make them share it. This will involve one child potentially moving out, being disrupted, needing to find a new home for himself and his family, and selling it to split the value if they cannot share.

And if it's not the closest city he works in, than that's even a bigger reason not to be there often.\n\nMaybe he imagined himself to run it from an office since his specialty is finance and hire a ranch manager to handle the day to day? There isn't anything wrong with that. It doesn't mean he values it less than Carlos does. Maybe he does, but we don't know that. Just bc he doesn't physically work it doesn't automatically mean that though.\n\nBesides, Carlos has been compensated the years he's been working on the ranch. He's not doing it for free. People keep posting as if he's been at the ranch putting in time and effort out of the goodness of his heart. Yeah, no. He's been working at mommy's/daddy's business.\n\nI'm not saying Jake's belief he was going to inherit the ranch alone isn't unreasonable. It seems to be, but Carlos shouldn't get it, or get more of it, just because he's been compensated to work there for several years.", "That is some BS roundabout talking in circles which is basically a lie. When that was said, there was no Carlos, so, any reasonable human being would take it as they were getting the ranch - the whole ranch, and the mom meant it that way.\n\nThe reasonable explanation to the immature Jake now is simply that the family changed over the years, so, circumstances changed, which shouldn't have to be explained to any rational, mature adult.\n\nThe OP is making a mistake by leaving it to both of them, though. Jake is jealous of Carlos, and feels animosity towards him now, hence the silent treatment, and feels that mom should have sided with him, as he is the \"real\" son - Jake is going to make co-ownership a nightmare for Carlos. If she wants Jake to have some benefit from it - she should set it up as Carlos will pay x amount of dollars to Jake upon some agreement, with no controlling interest by Jake. 2 people with control of a property that aren't seeing eye to eye is going to be detrimental to the property. You can not have two Chiefs of a tribe, especially when there is conflict, which there will be. Jake is already showing the immature nature of dealing with his feelings and his supposed \"best friend\" and brother Carlos. They WERE best friends, as long as Jake didn't see him as an equal. Jake expected to be his boss when mom passed.", "Was the ranch acquired while you were married to your wife? Inheritance laws can sometimes be tricky with children and assets if one parent dies and the spouse remarries. Jake could contest that he is already due 50% purely from what would have been Inheritance from your wife. It depends on where you live. I presume Carlos is paid well for the work he has done on the ranch and has a free place to live. I am not saying he doesn't deserve to inherit whatever you decide, but I work hard and have made my workplace more profitable doesn't mean I am owed half of it by law. My sister works for my mum's business, she is in the process of selling it. She isn't going to give half of the profit to my sister and my sister doesn't expect her to, although she has helped it to be more successful to some extent she was already paid well for the time she has done that. You are mainly at fault for making a promise like that, people never know what might happen in terms of assets they own.", "You should be angry. IMHO, he doesn't deserve half and it punished Carlos more to have to share what has become his family home (and punishes the grandchild most of all). After all the years cultivating it to thrive and succeed, now he has to take Jake's wants into account, and Jake's mad he has to take other, more deserving, family members into account? No thank you. Jake needs to act like and adult and realize you can do what you wish with your property, especially since you couldn't see the future 20 years ago.", "The more I think about it, the more I want to do the Reddit Reach that maybe Jake has debt or a lifestyle he can\u2019t support or something, and plans to sell the ranch to pay it off. His disproportionate reaction doesn\u2019t make sense, otherwise.", "This was my thought too.  if you make an \"inheritance\" promise to an ONLY child but then have another bio child--would that promise be reasonable?  I think not.", "51/49", "Sell Carlos the business for half value and the money from sale goes to Jake. \nIf it was run down and going broke I doubt Jake would be coming to put money and time into fix it.", "In my country it's easy to give 50,01% to a son and 49,99 to another.", "From my read of the post and comments the OP made, they favor Carlos because he went for an agro major and has been majorly involved in the ranch.\n\nThe OP insists they love them both the same, but that doesn't mean they can't, and don't, favor one more than the other.\n\nOne would imagine that the OP and Carlos are closer with having the ranch in common than the OP is with Jake. I'm sure Jake is aware of it. Jake shouldn't be penalized because he went into finance.\n\nI'm getting very frustrated reading all the posts of people pretty much wanting the OP to cut Jake out and give it all (or most of it) to Carlos because he's lived and worked there the last few years.\n\nNope, he was employee. He was getting paid, and/or he and his family were living free or cheap on the ranch. Again, Jake shouldn't be treated worse than because he chose to go into finance rather than work the ranch.\n\nIf the OP feels that Carlos should retain control of the ranch and Jake not be able to force a sale later like soooo many people are suggesting (and I wouldn't be surprised if the OP agrees), then the OP should SELL it at full fair value to Carlos now and give half that amount to Jake. That way any of the \"sweat equity\" people keep insisting Carlos is putting in would actually being going into his own business that he could do with as he pleases with no worries about Jake messing with it in the future.\n\n...but I can't imagine that would go over well with Jake either.\n\nThere is no winning move here, and the OP might have already lost Jake since he feels sooooo strongly about it and they berated him for it. They'll either all fight about it now while the OP is alive, or Jake and Carlos will probably more viciously when the OP is dead. Jake is going to find it very difficult, if not impossible, to let go of the promise made to him when he was a child. The damage is done. I don't even know how you mitigate it at this point and keep it from becoming awful.\n\nI agree there is something behind Jake's thinking about the ranch and how upset he is about it. I wonder if he resents Carlos for coming in and having to share the OP with them and then watching Carlos get full out adopted (was Jake 100% in favor of this?) by the OP. Then Carlos majors in agriculture and asks to work and live on the ranch. I don't think it's unreasonable for Jake to feel that Carlos was muscling in on things and the OP was favoring Carlos. I can't imagine after several years of Carlos working the ranch, that the OP hasn't become closer to him than Jake. They have the ranch to bond over. Does the OP hang out talking about finance with Jake? Hugely doubtful.\n\nAlso, a step sibling is often VERY different to a child than another biological sibling would be to them. They might very well be best friends now (is that actually true or does Carlos only think it is?), but that doesn't mean there isn't some resentment there. Jake may very well want something he doesn't have to share with Carlos after having to share everything for so many years. Was forced to share the OP, doesn't want to share OP's ranch he was told he was going to get?\n\n...or maybe Jake is irrationally stubborn and even with a biological sibling would still be hanging onto the promise the ranch would he (just) his. There are definitely people who only pass on the bulk of their wealth to their first born. Maybe he actually thought that was what was going to happen?? Maybe that is something that happens in their culture so it's not that crazy of a thought?\n\nIt seems like there HAS to be more than a grown man holding on to a statement made so long ago when of course he's aware the family situation drastically changed to include two new people.\n\nOP needs to have an adult conversation with Jake where they don't berate him to understand what he's thinking/feeling and why and how they might resolve this if possible. For 24 years, he thought he alone was getting the ranch. It might have been stupid of him to believe so, but that is what he believed. He's angry and disappointed right now.", "What a horrible situation! My parents had a terrible marriage and this is exactly what I feared. I didn't care about \"happy home\" or lovey doey step- , half- burdens and I am so unapologetic about it.", "He can do anything he wants, if he is the co-owner of the property.", "We have a family farm owned by multiple relatives.  Land cannot be sold unless all agree.  We have farm meetings and vote on things.  It has been in the family for 200 years.", "If you have to communicate with a 30 year old man that your family dynamic changed, therefore, wills change, you have bigger problems.\n\nthis isn't really about the ranch, anyway. This is about the fact that Jake expected to be treated like the \"real\" son, and his animosity and jealousy of Carlos are now a real problem.\n\nThis was about mom making Carlos his equal. Nope. Not gonna fly. That's why the silent treatment to Carlos, also. BIG mistake leaving them as co-owners now - should be a stipulation that Carlos pay Jake \"x\" but Jake has no controlling interest in the ranch, only financial. he will do whatever he has to to ruin if for Carlos now. Animosity and jealousy are strong, emotional motivators when your own mom chooses someone over you -which isn't what happened, but, it is in Jake's eyes.\n\nWhy do you think he need time alone, and needs to \"process:\" his feelings? That was a HUGE emotional hit and Jake does not appear to be taking it well.", "I mean, I think that the promise was (and should have been) \\*always\\* contingent on additional siblings being added to the family. But that's a pretty difficult factor to explain to a 6-year-old, especially when you haven't even introduced a new partner into the family dynamic yet. OP maybe could have said something about how the plan changed some time over the years, but it's also reasonable to assume that your kid would figure out how life works as he grew up and would expect that a new brother meant his inheritance would get split now.", "I mean, what if OP had had another bio child? Would Jake still be such an ass about it then? OP is NTA. Jake is a massive AH.", "I have a hard time believing Jake remembered this so distinctly from a drive when he was six. I think OP has brought it up since then. He obviously thought of it as his inheritance, so why hasn\u2019t OP clarified things in all this time? Also, what can Carlos expect to receive from his mother\u2019s estate? I don\u2019t believe she isn\u2019t justified in leaving it to both, but with one working it and one in a different field, things may get messy.", "Yeah, but the most honest thing to say probably would have been that the ranch will go to \"you and any other siblings who might come into our family in the future,\" which of course is the unsaid part that OP meant but a 6-year old can't understand. But that's a hell of a can of worms to open up in conversation with a small child, so I think OP is totally reasonable to just leave it at \"you will get the ranch when you're older.\"", "It doesn't really matter. You can do as you wish with your assets, especially when you take into account the efforts by individuals in your life. A total stranger could come into your life, care for you in time of need while other family is MIA, and be left everything and it s totally legal, and honestly, probably more ethical, and definitely more kind.", "Is there even a place for Jake and his family on the ranch if they wanted it?  Or did Carlos get in first and Jake get cut out?  Jake didn't know that working on the ranch was going to play a part in who inherited the ranch because of OP's earlier promise - it seems a bit of a bait and switch. \n\nHow would Jake's father want the ranch to be settled?  Would he want someone else's grandsons to have his passion project?  How did the ranch come into the family originally?  Who paid for it and when?  What is Carlos' father going to leave to Jake?", "To be clear, I don't think there's a right, or a wrong, way to do a step-adoption, or the associated inheritance. Sometimes it's happy lovey, sometimes it's not. Sometimes step kids aren't the same as bio kids and that's just life. There's no inherent obligation to treat Carlos and Jake exactly the same. \n\nWhere i firmly believe that Jake is the asshole though is that it *didn't even occur to him* that his legally adopted brother of 23 years might be considered equal to him in the eyes of his parents and still expected to be treated as if he were an only child. \n\nThere's no \"hey, what's the sitch now Carlos is around?\" awareness, that didn't even cross Jake's mind. He just treated everything as if 23 years of Carlos never happened. \n\nMy point is if he'd got a new bio brother, it would almost certainly have occurred to him to go 'shit, is this promise still valid?'. It didn't even occur to him that a new adopted brother would be treated as part of the family, too. He just assumed he wasn't a 'real' brother right from the get go. That's kinda a dick move.", "OP is male btw. Speaks in comments about losing his wife, mentioned in the post how Jake was going to inherit his late mother\u2019s estate, and not expecting to fall in love again, especially with a man.", "In Jakes defense, it's still his inheritance and I think it's reasonable to think that the work he was doing to further his career in other areas earned him the right to it. Like, even if Carlos had not been into the ranch either, I feel like both of them would still be entitled to inherit a portion of it as OP's sons. And I could see how Jake could feel like he pursued certain goals because the promise was made that he would have the financial security from this property as a backup, so it would be kind of BS/gaslighting to act years later like the promise was always conditional upon his working on the ranch. Jake might literally have build his life around the idea that he was getting this ranch no matter what he did. That probably instilled a toxic sense of entitlement towards his brother/other people, but he should never have been made to feel like his right to the ranch was not dependent on the amount of work he put into the it or even the addition of new siblings to the family.   \n\n\nOP is NTA at all, but I do think that giving Jake no portion of the Ranch at all would be shitty, too.", "You communicate with the people that you love , that\u2019s her son. If you love someone it doesn\u2019t matter the age you talk , if you prefer to say you\u2019re 30 figure it out people will leave you because they can\u2019t read your mind\n\nNowhere Jake said the \u201creal son\u201d so no point in arguing that point, that\u2019s an assumption .\n\n\nI hope you work for Marvel dude that\u2019s some great writing for people you don\u2019t know.

With or without rent, he's not being favored financially, he's making it \"thrive\" per OP, which benefits the entire family. Jake is the one getting more for less due to Carlos' efforts.", "To be fair to Carlos, I think just working to maintain the ranch would be enough to justify his lack of rent. That's overlooking the fact that it's pretty shitty to treat your best friend/brother as an indentured servant. Carlos's equity is based on his status as OP's child, not to mention the improvements he made to the ranch with his work. Also, it seems like Jake had the equal option to live there rent-free and chose not to so he could pursue a finance career in another place.", "Whether it is totally legal depends a lot on local laws. There are also places where a portion of your inheritance has to go to your children.", "Where? And what evidence do you have of so called \"local laws\". I just did some research and found no evidence of such requirements. I found lots on how to ensure they get it because the opposite is a lot more common.ar least in the  US, a pretty capitalist society, they don't tell you what you must do with you cash.", "Yeah, but the point that she doesn't have to give any to anyone if she doesn't want to is also valid. No one is \"owed* anything, unless you count Carlos' sweat equity.", "I really hate the culture that is ok to lie to children. \n\nThe change of having a new son is a perfectly good reason, the age of Jake is not.", "So?\n\nCarlos is an EMPLOYEE. He's either been getting paid (he asked to WORK at the ranch), and/or he and his family are getting to live there free or cheap.\n\nHe's being compensated.\n\nIt's literally no different than the OP deciding to hire a good ranch manager who turned the ranch around. It's absolutely no different.\n\nJust because Carlos decided to major in agriculture and had a built in job at the ranch doesn't mean that Jake should be treated as less or entitled to receive less because he chose to major in finance and isn't there all the time...bc you know, he has a job in finance a few hours away in the city and doesn't actually live on the ranch. \\*rolls eyes\\*", "Because Jake is going to want to ruin it for Carlos. Jake not talking to Carlos over this is very indicative of animosity towards Carlos now, as Jake expected to be his boss when mom passed. Jake sees himself as the \"real\" son, and the jealousy and animosity he is showing now will  make co-ownership a nightmare. Jake will sell his half to someone else who will cause problems in some sort of way for Carlos.\n\nHe won't simply let Carlos buy him out and live happily ever after. He will want to ruin it for Carlos. He and Carlos were \"best friends\" as long as Carlos wasn't his equal - again, he expected to be his boss when mom passed, so, he didn't see Carlos as an equal. His mom treating Carlos equal to him just sealed the deal that things won't be the same. \n\nThe fact that it is a successful business only makes the sale price better, it's not like he'll be losing anything. He 'll get a lump sum of cash, and the satisfaction of seeing Carlos lose all of his hard work and home, while teaching him that he wasn't equal to him.", "It's always going to be uneven because Jake's mother's assets are going to go to him. But OP is splitting their assets equally between their two sons, which is the fairest thing they can do. \n\nIt's up to them to decide if they are selling/if one is buying the other out after OP passes. Millions of siblings do it each year.", "I mean. This is just an example from [my own country](https://www.government.nl/topics/inheritance-tax/question-and-answer/can-i-disinherit-my-spouse-or-children). Seeing as OP pointed out he is not from the US, US laws obviously do not apply.", "Carlos is more than an employee. Carlos is literally OP's other son who works the farm. Doesn't matter what or how he gets paid he's just as important to OP as Jake. That's all that matters in the end hence why the property is getting split. If OP wants the farm to remain standing and functioning after they pass then yes it would be a much better idea to leave the farm as whole to the child who actually has shown interest since a young age, got a degree centered around farm work, and actually puts in the work to not only maintain it but also make it profitable. That's not say Jake gets nothing but it makes more sense to leave him other things that he could use, like money, that could benefit him because he's just never shown interest in the farm at all.", "Exactly. Which is why OP needs to balance things very carefully. And that\u2019s not taking into account any emotional attachment Jake may have to the ranch. Albeit he doesn\u2019t seem as engaged.", "Maybe Carlos is left the ranch and Jake is left money equal to the selling price of the house.", "I agree that OP is being fair and that they just have to split it and deal with buyouts as normal, but just to clarify the situation... it's a bit hard to tell because OP made a typo, but I think that \\*Carlos\\* is actually going to be left additional inheritance from his mom, not Jake. I believe that OP is Jake's bio mom and Carlos's stepmom. Carlos's mom died, so he will be left an inheritance from her as well as one from his new mother. It sounds like maybe Jake finds it unfair because he doesn't have a separate inheritance, in addition to the ranch, from his own bio dad. Perhaps he feels like the ranch represents his inheritance from both bio parents, and thus feels like Carlos is sharing in his inheritance while Jake doesn't get to share in Carlos's. I dunno, just trying to put myself in those shoes.", "YTA.\n\nYou made a promise which he has clearly not forgotten - by taking this step now, you are likely leaving a lasting and irredeemable impact on Jake and Carlos\u2019 relationship well after you are long gone.\n\nIs Carlo\u2019s father leaving half his assets to Jake? \n\nDoes Carlos pay full rent? Does Carlos have a share of the profit currently? Does Jake? It seems Carlos has inherited the business already - he certainly has the benefit of one. \n\nHow you dealt with this is also poor - for a child who you say is \u201cyour everything\u201d, you are breaking promises and insulting him.\n\nBy taking this step, you have probably reinforced to Jake any feelings he has that Carlos is the preferred child.", "Ok I am so probably get down voted for this but here it goes. \n\nThere are a few things that stood out to me as I was reading your post:\n\n1- you said this use to be a special weekly trip for you and Jack up until he was 6/7. Then you meet Carlos and started to include him. At 6/7 it was probably fun to include hime and show him a round however I wonder if he was starting to feel like his was loosing this special time with you.\n\n2- op said that these trip continued with both boys until jake was 16. Again I wonder if he slacked on going because he felt again op was taking their special time and it just wasn\u2019t as special for him to go. I also wonder if maybe op felt like the third wheel because op seems to have more in common with the stepson then Jack.\n\n3- back to Jake quiting at 16. My child played football. Football games when my child played where always on the Friday nights.  so if you where going to the ranch with Carlos weekly who was going to watch and cheer on Jake at football games.\n\n4- back to op and Carlos continue going on this trip with op every weekend when Jake stopped. This leads me to wonder if they have a lot more in common.\n\nSo here is my Reddit leap. I wonder op if by not meaning too you started to push your sone away at 6/7 by stopping special weekly trips the 2 of you by being Carlos every time. I am not in no way saying Carlos should have been included but maybe you should have picked random weekend to show that although you love Carlos that the bond you share with Jake was still there. Because YOU choose to marry Carlos\u2019s father and bring another child in. NOT Jake to him at 6/7 he just sees this new KId taking over something special he shared with his only parent left.\n\nNow let touch on the fact that i see you and Carlos having so much in common that maybe Jake felt like he was a third wheel so he stopped going on this trip.  So he started playing a sport where games are weekend centered and instead of watching and cheering him on you just continue to build a bond with the stepson.\n\nSo now it leads me to now. You let Carlos move, live and improve the ranch with out remembering a promise you made that it would eventually be Jakes. I am not saying you where not within your rights to do this. However I think you should have at least had a conversation with Jake about Carlos moving there and settling with a family. Explained that you know you made promises to him but when those promises where made you didn\u2019t realize how things would change. But you didn\u2019t. Again I think this was because you have more in common with Carlos and your sons was yet again a second thought or a third wheel. \n\nSo now let\u2019s talk about the real issue. Everyone is focusing on the fact that Jake is being entitled and shouldn\u2019t expect to inherit the whole ranch. I am looking at this differed. \n\n\nYou just proved to your son 30 years later what he always thought. He was loosing his only parent. He grew up feeling replaced and now you showed him that by not keeping a promise to a 6 year old. Apparently a promise that meant so much to a 6 year old that he held on to that promise for 30 years. Yet again in jakes mind you yet again picked Carlos over him like you did when you went to the ranch with Carlos over going to football games. \n\n\nYour son realized 16 years ago that he lost his only parent. Now you just sent that message and prove what he always feared.  I believe that\u2019s why he is mad at not only you but his stepbrother. And no your husband isn\u2019t getting involved because his son is benefiting from your decision with out looking bad.\n\n\nListen I don\u2019t think you did anything in malleus. However I do think you have damaged your relationship with your son. Especially by saint he is been ridiculous by still expecting this promos to be upheld instead of talking to him. Validating his feelings and explaining to him things have changed. And I also believe by doing this you have damaged what seems to be a good relationship with your son and your stepson.", "YTA and you better be 1000% sure your husband plans to divide his assets equally too.

Seems like he has unfair expectations that need to be put in check.", "You\u2019re not an AH. Yes name calling is never right, and will always derail a conversation into an argument. But Jake is also a 30 year old man and I believe he\u2019s being disingenuous pretending that he still expected to receive the ranch to himself fully, under the circumstances that you now have another son who you literally adopted and is equally your son. He sounds like he\u2019s still a little immature if he hasn\u2019t realized that this would obviously change things, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s had to have crossed his mind at some point. Even if not, I think it\u2019ll be important to have an open and honest discussion and ask him why he\u2019s struggling with the idea of sharing the inheritance considering he\u2019s had a brother for most of his life and you\u2019d think that at this point they\u2019d be bonded enough and Jake would be mature enough to understand the inheritance is going to both because they\u2019re both your sons. It\u2019s a little concerning if nothing else but I\u2019m sure you will be able to talk through it with Jake and move past it. Best of luck to you.", "Well no, he feels entitled to it because he was promised it and when the parent changed their mind they didn\u2019t say anything.", "Again, OP literally said \"lol, you expect my promises to mean anything?\" This after OP BROUGHT UP THE SUBJECT and that's what came out. No explanation of that OP intended it at the time but things change. No breakdown of why Jake's inheritance is roughly equal. Just literally \"I am the scorpion and you are the frog and you were stupid and/or naive to trust me.\" That's what OP said, if not what OP meant.\n\nMaybe Jake is a complete asshole and he secretly hated Carlos his entire life. We don't have enough evidence for this. Carlos says Jake is his best friend, so is that really likely?", "So does Jake get half of Carlos's father's will?  Because it's two dads and the kids have different mom.", "If op does this then they will definitely ruin what is left if their relationship with Jake. He is already upset do you honestly think it will fix op\u2019s relationship with Jake by taking the whole ranch a way from him. He may not know how to do physical labor however he works in finance and understand how to run a business. \n\nIf she takes the whole ranch away  from  then she better be willing to never see him and ruin the relationship that Jake and Carlos have. Because this will but the finale nail in the coffin for both relationships", "Yeah this is the vibe I got. Suddenly a \u201cpromise\u201d 20 years ago needs to be honored because business is booming!\n\nSnark aside, INFO: Have you or Jake brought up said promise at any point in the past twenty years that could make it seem to Jake that it\u2019s legit?", "> Ofc things change when you get a brother. It would happen if she had another bio child too.\n\nOf course they change, but OP made a promise and it never came up again. If OP was the one to come to Jake and explain how the promise was no longer viable, i'm sure Jake would understand. But Jake never had a reason to consciously rethink how realistic that promise was, until OP basically told him \"lol you really think that? idiot\".", "I mean I\u2019m sure Carlos has been paid for his work?", "Depending on how Carlos father splits, Carlos will actually gain more than half. OP plans to have Carlos father inherit the house. Which implies it was a pre marriage asset, potentially split with their prior partner. So Carlos might be getting that too.", "you mean how much can the entitled boy encroach on his brother's business and home that he worked hard on for 8+ years while his brother lived a different life that had nothing to do with the ranch?\n\nah yes what an unfair scenario that would be if the brother who had nothing to do with the ranch couldn't use his brother's home and business to store his shit\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyou reaize the ranch brings in money which means Jake gets money from this right? not like he's just getting land he gets nothing from and can't use", "Jake is getting the whole ranch.

That's his/her child.", "In this case, Op said they adopted Carlos. Carlos is op's son, not step son. Step kids would be different in most scenarios. Especially with family property.", "When I first read this I assumed Jake was so mad bc OP left Carlos the ranch.

Jake being mad he doesn't get the whole thing is ridiculous.", "OP is a man.", "OP said Jake went into \u201cengineering in agronomy\u201d.  I believe s/he (gender is unclear) meant agricultural engineering.  I see nothing nefarious in that.

And it's something that people are overlooking. They're also ignoring that OP steadafastly avoids talking about how Carlos father plans to split his inheritance.\n\nAnd what some completely miss. OP seems to own their current residence, appears it was a shared property with OP's prior partner. That one goes 100% to Carlos father. So depending on how Carlos father plans to split stuff, it'll go entirely to Carlos as well.", "A shy pond with timid water.", "What does that have to do with ornamental garden fish?", "OP essentially said that this was their thought in a different comment. They assumed that the situation was pretty self-explanatory. I would have thought that some time in his teens or twenties, at least, Jake would have realized that more siblings = less inheritance.", "No one is making Carlos work there. He asked his parent if he could after graduation. They said he had a guaranteed job at the ranch. He's not indentured to anyone. He's free to work another agriculture job if he can find one.\n\nCarlos is being compensated to work there. It is no different than if the OP had hired a ranch manager who was good at what they were being paid to do and improved the ranch.\n\nThe OP hasn't said, but being that he asked to live and work there, I think it's safe to assume he's taking a salary from the ranch profits. If not, I would imagine he's living there free. It may be both. If he didn't improve the ranch so it would have profits, he would need to get a job somewhere else, so it's in HIS best interest for it to be better than it was.\n\nI don't get where you think he's an indentured servant. He's being compensated in some way(s) to work the ranch. If that compensation is fair, then great. If it's more than it should be if the OP hired someone else to do the same job, than it's not fair to Jake right now.\n\nMaybe it's less than if the OP hired someone. That would be sucky for Carlos, but again, no one is making him work there. I would actually imagine that at first he wasn't being compensated fairly for his work because where would the money have been coming from? I would think at the time, living rent free was very likely, which of course is only fair.\n\nBut I don't believe he's working there for anyone's benefit more than for his own ultimately.\n\nAnd I \\*definitely\\* don't think that just because he works there, he deserves to get the whole ranch or more of it like many people have suggested because fuck Jake.\n\nIs it fortunate for Jake that he MIGHT get more out of it due to Carlos having worked there? I don't know... you'll have to ask Jake. It sure sounds like he wanted the non-profitable, passion project ranch all to himself rather than sharing as it currently is. Unless he was being disingenuous when saying he's thought since he was 6 that he alone was going to get it. Until eight years ago, that ranch was a hobby, and if you believe him, he wanted it and thought it would be his.\n\nIs he being fair or reasonable in thinking it would just be his? No. The only exception I'll make is if it's their culture to pass assets along to first born children, or if it is a generational ranch that's been passed down in the OP's family. I don't think the ranch should be split if it's been handed down.\n\nIf neither of those cases apply, then he's unreasonable. But it doesn't mean that things may currently be unfair financially in Carlos's favor. It depends on his total compensation versus his position. Also, let's keep in mind that there are no guarantees that the ranch will continue to make a profit. When the OP passes it may be back to just being a hobby ranch if that. It might be in debt. Who knows.\n\nI will never change my opinion that Carlos is working as a employee on the ranch. He's not the owner or co-owner. He shouldn't financially benefit from his job there more than is fair for the position. He might be owed some compensation if he barely had any when first getting the ranch turned around. Ok, that's fair. Hope someone is keeping a tab. I don't believe for a moment though that Carlos didn't have his own thoughts/plans for the ranch, hence the choice in major and the request to live and work there after graduation. That doesn't mean he planned to push Jake out, but if he didn't have his own plans for what to do with it, he just would have got a job paying properly somewhere else when he graduated. Of course Carlos is putting into it what he hopes to get out of it. It was a hobby ranch not making money. There is no logical reason for him to want to put his time and effort into it unless he planned on it paying out for himself at some point.\n\nI got a whiff of favoritism for Carlos in the post and comments and was just curious if things are fair now. Jake is unreasonable about later, but since the OP is insisting they love them both exactly the same and it was being split 50/50 later, I just was wondering what's up now. I don't believe that Jake should be penalized because he chose to work in finance.", "This rule generally applies only when there are minor children in the picture.", "What if Jake needs the money or simply wants the money?", "If Carlos is not paying for housing right now, surely he has some time to start putting what he would put into savings in order to buy jake out.", "I think it's a bot", "And that\u2019s what I am saying no one communicated , Op also thinks that\u2019s MIGHT be it , Jake might also thought that he might have less inheritance but the ranch will stay with him. We don\u2019t know , but what\u2019s important not even OP knows . Have a family meeting, air it all out .", "50% of OP's, while Carlos seems to be getting 50% of that. And 100% from his father.

And 100% of whatever his father leaves him.", "Exactly...and why OP's plan to leave the ranch to each of them as   joint owners is a  DISASTER.\n\nShe needs to consult with an estate planner  and come up with an alternative.    *see my plan posted above. https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g5ktm/aita_for_calling_my_son_ridiculous_for_asking_me/jfkin0k/", "Jake said he needed some time to process this information.

I do think making promises to kids that might change is foolish though. But I'm sure at the time you thought it was the case. Life changes and you now have 2 sons. They both deserve to be treated as equals. Your son sounds like he's just being greedy.", "NTA - My grandma passed a few years ago. All my life she told me she would leave her house to me. My dad is her only surviving child, and I am his only surviving bio child. My grandma never really liked the foster kids he adopted, and never considered them her grandkids. He also adopted my stepbrother, and she did consider him a grandkid. During her lifetime, she constantly gave my dad and brother money for various things. The only money she ever gave me was for college one year when I was short on tuition. She always made sure I knew where she hid her cash and important documents in case anything ever happened to her. Shortly before she passed, she told me that her hidden cash was gone (we are talking at one point it was around $15k) because she used the last of it to buy my dad a truck and my brother a house. My brother was supposed to reimburse her after he flipped the house, but instead he took the money from the sale and move across the country without telling her. She was very hurt by that, and never saw him again before she passed. \nAs her health was failing, I kept urging her to make a will and put her affairs in order. She did shortly before she passed, but the attorney discouraged her from making a will and instead had her put a transfer-on-death clause on her house and bank accounts. After she passed, we discovered that she had put my dad and me in a 50/50 split on everything. My dad was pretty upset because he already had all her money spent in his mind and didn't want to share with me. We argued over the house, because he wanted to sell it. I told him he was welcome to try to find a buyer for his half, when the other owner wasn't selling and was also living in the house. My grandma and I were very close, and once I was able to get out of bed after she passed, I went over to the house. My dad had tossed the place looking for hidden money. He also ended up taking everything of value and selling it. Once I bought his half of the house from him, he pretty much stopped talking to me (we were never close).\nSo - your assets are yours to do with as you please. But in the interest of family relationships after you are gone, you should probably discuss with your heirs what you are doing and why if your directives are likely to cause a rift in the family. My grandma knew that my dad just wanted money, and that if he knew how she left things he'd probably try to cut me out completely. There was no relationship to destroy. But in your case, it sounds like maybe you need to have a family heart-to-heart conversation to see what your heirs think would be equitable.", "Okay soft YTA.

He wants the money.\n\nAfter everything that has transpired, I would talk to Carlos, and ask him if he would be willing to buy the ranch from you.

You'd think that if Jake genuinely cared about the ranch, he would have brought it up multiple times and made some kind of plans for it. Or at least asked to get this promise in writing!\n\nBut no, he just visited occasionally while Carlos was the one who spent years making improvements and building a successful business. Now suddenly Jake feels sad about not getting all of the ranch... please.", "> but OP made a promise and it never came up again.\n\nIt is ridiculous to assume it's still upheld if not discussed for 24 _years_", "> Look, some promises are stupid. Some promises are short-sighted and ultimately not reasonable to keep. \n\nAnd if the promise was made to a grown up, i'm sure they'd realize that circumstances change when they'd get a new brother.\n\nBut the promise was made to a six year old. That six year old probably thought \"this will one day be mine\" every time in his long life he visited that ranch. And without any reason to reexamine that belief, he's held it for 25 years.\n\n*Because* the promise was made to a child, it is extra important for OP to talk to him, so that he can reexamine that belief as a grown up. That doesn't automatically happen by itself.", "It also begs the question on how does Jake see Carlos? Because it\u2019s totally normal for parents to split the property amongst siblings.\n\nBut we have a party at our house rn, I\u2019m tipsy and this is all conjecture. lol", "Not if made to a six year old, who grew up with that knowledge as being rock solid.\n\nIts not like the promise was never interacted with anymore, every time that child visited the ranch in the back of his mind he likely reminded himself about that promise. \n\nIt is ridiculous to assume you can simply ignore promises made after a specific time. Especially if that promise has to do with inheritance, which naturally only comes up after years.\n\nIt is a bit naieve, but thats why you shouldn't make such a promise to a child - they are pretty naieve, and will have had years of telling themselves it was a fact, before ever having to think critically. \n\nIf someone had asked him \"hey, you remember that promise, do you think it still counts now that you have a brother and its years ago and things changed?\" He probably would've concluded himself that it wasn't realistic. But no one ever told him to think about it, so he had no reason to reevaluate his rock solid belief.", "Op not answering about Carlos dad\u2019s will bothers me. That right there shows me OP isn\u2019t giving all the info needed to make an accurate decision. It shouldn\u2019t matter what Jakes mom is leaving him but we got that info too.", "Yep, the entire post and all feels incredibly manipulative. But people fell for it hook, line, and sinker it seems.", "I really need to point this out once again, but this sub has such extreme examples people often seem to forget human emotions are a thing and having a bad reaction doesn't automatically go hand in hand with being a caricature of a deplorable person. What the post showed was Jake being told one thing from childhood and having no further communication about it from that point. There's no conversations about Carlos putting in sweat equity. No conversations about how the situation is evolving and they should discuss what that means for the future. You are assuming Jake's malice and sense of superiority. Do you know another possibility? Jake is seeing a promise broken abruptly and is needing to process that. Frankly there's a good chance he's not thinking of this logically at all and not talking to Carlos isn't a sign that he thinks he's better. Its just harder for him to process his emotions and the logic of the situation when also dealing with other people in the situation. It's been a week. And OP has attempted calling multiple times. Unless Jake has literally nothing else going in his life, a week to promise something emotional is not a long timeframe. And OP trying to push in before he's ready is only making it worse.\n\nAlso please remember to look at surrounding context. OP married someone a year after meeting them. And suddenly trips with their parent to the ranch is now trips with the blended family. Exactly how much personal time was Jake getting throughout their childhood? What would Jake's post be like? Maybe this is hitting them hard because they do in fact like/love their brother but its yet another moment of OP breaking a promise in favor of the blended family.", "To the kind redditor who gave me the award, thank you so so much.", "I would say OP YTA. Carlos got a job at the ranch which means he\u2019s getting paid for his work. He\u2019s not working there for free. OP did tell Jake the ranch would be his one day. He went for a finance degree and we don\u2019t know why. It could be a pretty good speculation to think that it was for his future with running the ranch. I don\u2019t think Jake or Carlos is an AH here but OP should have sat Jake down when he graduated high school to ask about his plans for the future. It would have allowed him to plan better considering clearly part of his future plan was from OP promising him a large asset.", "The son is being ridiculous though. That promise was made when he was 6 and the OP only had one kid. Most people would realize circumstances had changed in the intervening 20 ish years.", "Is Jake doing any accounting for the ranch, helping out with the taxes?\n\nJust speaking as the IT department for my family, people can really overlook the work you do for them and what it's worth.", "The mom can add a provision in the will stipulating the property not be sold in order to inherit or forfeit their ownership stake.", "Jack doesn't have to consider Carlos as his brother Just because OP adopted him. Specially If Carlos' dad doesn't treat him like a child, Just like a stepchild. Also, OP owns the ranch and Carlos have his livehood because work there doesn't mean he's entiltled to It. Maybe Jack though he could do the same thing OP is doing now.", "Did Carlos pay any rent? If not, his contribution was his rent. It would be unfair because Carlos gets to live there, and that's probably the reason Jake doesn't visit as often. When does Jake get the place to himself? All he gets is a financial stake, not possession. Right now, it's Carlos' house.", "OP met and married someone with a child after a year. And then all ranch trips (which was a family thing) became a blended family thing. If we are going with a Reddit Reach I am much more inclined to believe Jake got denied a lot of individual attention and the reaction here is because its just another example  where he gets blindsided into having to share everything. Logically he might have been completely cool with Carlos sharing but the way it was just thrown out there without a word just caused other memories to resurface.", "lol, so true", "Talk about missing the point...", "I didn't say he shouldn't expect part of the ranch. I'm saying the OP didn't bother to lay things out to them when they were young. \n\nJake was told it'll be 100% yours. That changed when Carlos came into the picture, but the op never told Jake that things had changed. So he is living his life thinking \"I will own this someday,\" and then it gets dropped on him that no he will not.", "Maybe the fact that he barely visits it?", "It only ripples when alone so no one notices it =)", "Or Jake isn\u2019t speaking to Carlos because their mother hurt him and, after only a week of trying to wrap his head around this information, he doesn\u2019t want to take it out on the wrong person? Had someone let me believe I\u2019d get that inheritance all my life just to tell me otherwise, it would take me more than a week to get over it.\n\nThe fact is, we only know OP\u2019s side, not what Jake is thinking or feeling."]}
