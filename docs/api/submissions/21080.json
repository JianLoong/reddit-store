Your dad had invited both of you after all.", "NTA you legitimately forgot and it's a family event you normally attend. She needs to understand that instead of trying to belittle you (read manipulate) for taking part in something you normally do with your family. Everyone's family dynamic is different you either respect what people do and let them enjoy it or take a walk.", "NTA, but I can understand why she's upset about a last-minute change.   Some people think an anniversary is just about the couple.  It always irked my MIL that her husband's mother sent her a card on their wedding anniversary and expected the same on their own anniversary.   It's just a difference between families.   Personally, I prefer most anniversaries to be just hubby and I, but I think milestone anniversaries can include other people, especially any children created from that union.   Why didn't you invite her to the anniversary dinner as your dad suggested?", "NTA It\u2019s not weird to celebrate your parents anniversary at all, it\u2019s more weird that your gf would think that way. Are her parents divorced/ not together or unhappy? It also sounded like your parents wanted her there, did you mention that to her?", "NTA and why be with someone who's behavior spikes your anxiety and is condescending. This is not loving. \n\nFamilies differ in what they celebrate. Instead of her being open she insults what your family values and how it is celebrated. \n\nYou made a mistake re: the anniversary; something you want to attend. You adjusting time together may disappoint her but we all make mistakes. Best to you.", "NTA. It sounds like you and gf might have different values. This is a big anniversary. Of course, you should be there. \n\nAre you chronically late or changing plans??? If not, then I am notngetting her upset.", "NTA.  This feels like a red flag, TBH.  Unless you're a chronic canceller or always changing plans last minute, then she's being selfish and immature.", "NTA\n\nIt's not weird.  And even if it was, who cares.  \n\nDating and having to give up every single weekend is crazy hard.  Missing one day is no big deal.  \n\nPart of being in a relationship is learning to respect the things your partner is really into even if it makes little sense to you.   I feel like she's being awfully dismissive.  \n\nPlus, ummm, she's never heard of an anniversary party?  Never seen one on TV?", "NTA. It seems pretty normal to me to celebrate with them. Either way, it\u2019s normal for your family and it\u2019s a bigger day. Postponing it shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal.", "NTA.\n\nPeople celebrate anniversaries, especially milestone ones all the time with their families.\n\nIs there something going on that you're not reporting?  Have you done this frequently?  Because I'm getting a seriously \"Main Character Personality\" vibe from your GF.", "NTA. Being a good person requires flexibility", "YTA.

You have every right to feel the need to prioritize your parents anniversary if you feel it is important to attend. However your gf has every right to feel slighted by your decision and to be disappointed in your choice. People have different habits and views when it comes to their families of origin (FOO). One thing that might be a good idea is for you and her to have a serious discussion at some point about what your expectations of commitment to ones FOO particularly where it might impact her expectations of you as a partner. Best to sort these things out early, rather than later.", "NTA. Slightly your fault for forgetting but this is a red flag.", "He was referring to my dog and I. I don\u2019t believe she\u2019d make the drive atm.", "I should clarify they meant the dog and I. Yes her parents are divorced. My parents are also going through a bit of a rough patch so I think that may also add to her reaction", "I rarely cancel plans but I am late to things often. It\u2019s about a two hour drive to visit each-other and I\u2019ll say I\u2019m gonna leave at 3 and I end up leaving at 4 which puts me in rush hour which adds and hour or so.  This is a common area of conflict between us. Not just driving but stuff like this happens more often than I\u2019d like to admit", "NTA. Coming here to say this. Complete red flag. Find a local girlfriend.", "I do have a problem with dates and time management. Personally I think my time management is my biggest personal problem but it has gotten better especially since the two of us started dating. We are still leagues apart on that aspect though.", "YTA! In one of your comments you say you\u2019re bad at time management..so be honest, is this the first time you\u2019ve fucked up plans with your girl cause you double booked or forgot something else important??? Cause unfortunately if this isn\u2019t the 1st or 3rd time you\u2019ve screwed up then yea she\u2019s justified in being upset. You should edit your post to be honest about yourself..", "YTA. Learn to use a calendar. Stop being and hour late to events YOU plan with your GF. \n\nInvite her to the family milestone celebration that you completely forgot about and actually apologize for double booking. \n\nIf someone constantly said, I'll leave at 3 and see you at 5, and then they actually leave at 4 and I see them after 6:30, that's very disrespectful of my time. Then they call and want to show up after I'm asleep because they forgot a very important annual family event? I'd be upset. \n\nYes you should go to your family event, but also should apologize and actually figure out how to manage your time. From your GF perspective, she gets less priority in your life than just about everything else. Also, why can't you take your dog with you?", "I would say N A H\n\nYou have a valid commitment that slipped your mind and you let her know as soon as possible after you realized. \n\nShe's entitled to be frustrated about your flaky time management. \n\n\nBut....her contempt about your parents anniversary is a sticking point for me.\nIf your family has regularly celebrated National Pancake Day together, that's something special to your family and even if she doesn't want to participate,  she needs to avoid making you feel like you are wrong to continue to be part of family gatherings.\n\nHer jabs about the anniversary tipped the scales to NTA", "Nta but a red flag for you.", "NTA. I get that she might be sad about the change of plans, but family events are important. Who cares if she\u2019s never heard of someone celebrating their parents anniversary with them? You do and it\u2019s important to you. That\u2019s all that should matter. Sucks you forgot, but as long as you apologized I don\u2019t think it should be that big of an issue. These things happen.", "My family is whacky about time in general. My gf is in bed fast asleep by 10 so driving all that way would not be ideal. The dinner they were gonna have would be around 10. But I let them know what happened so we are gonna have a small desert dinner earlier and they can have their nice dinner without me. I just feel like I\u2019m letting both sides down but my parents were understanding.", "I\u2019ve had to cancel a date a few times in the two years we\u2019ve been together. I do find myself running late to things on occasion though.", "I do have poor time management but I rarely cancel dates.", "you forgot. you apologized to your gf for forgetting, yes? so that\u2019s done. (if not, do that.) you could also pay her special attention when you see her, to further apologize for forgetting. do not entertain the idea that you should have skipped your parent\u2019s anniversary to make her dinner. nta, because her response to your parent\u2019s anniversary was, frankly, rude and unnecessary.", "Wait so your dog was invited but your girlfriend wasn\u2019t?\n\nETA: I\u2019d be pissed if you were canceling a date for a family thing and I wasn\u2019t even invited after 2 years together. Does your family frequently exclude her?", "Well then hell man..late and completely canceling/rescheduling are different things, and y\u2019all are seeing each other regularly\u2026 I still think you pulled a dick move cause honestly you should try to figure out a way to manage your time better that way you aren\u2019t last minute doing something like that, but it\u2019s infrequent. Like has she told you that your time mismanagement is an issue for her?? Cause if not then it\u2019s like passive aggressive punishment for a behavior she hadn\u2019t communicated with you about", "Edit your post to add that you\u2019re bad at managing yourself. Cause the way it reads this was a onetime thing where you overlooked an important event and made plans with your girl. \n\nUnfortunately this comment and the knowledge that per your own admission you have issues with dates/time makes me say YTA. If this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve done something like this (blowing her off or rescheduling last minute cause you double booked forgot something) you suck as boyfriend and it\u2019s not surprising that she\u2019d be upset.", "Feels like she's wildly out of line here but that's just how I would take it.  You're definitely NTA and Congratulations to your folks on 35 years!", "I did not give a real apology as I was caught off guard by her response. But I will do that when I see her. I also need to tell her how those comments felt somehow", "We had some issues with this in the beginning of our relationship but I\u2019ve been getting better at communicating (as gf and I discussed) when things set me back as soon as it happens. I also do things sooner than I used to to give me more of a buffer but I\u2019m by no means as good as she is with time.", "Also how do I edit a post on here\u2026. You made a fair point I should include that", "This is the first time I\u2019ve \u201cdouble booked\u201d like this that I can remember. But I do have chronic time management issues that have been improving since we started dating. I\u2019ll update the post as soon as I figure out how I don\u2019t use Reddit often", "i think that is a great idea. start with the apology, and then follow that with how her response made you feel. how she responds to that will tell you a lot.", "Ok..so full honesty. It sounds like my guess about this being a recurring(altho you\u2019re working at being better-acknowledged) problem was correct, with that in mind yea dude her being upset is understandable. Dunno how long y\u2019all have been together but you probably surpassed her acceptable range on repeat behavior(and I don\u2019t know the girl) but really, everybody has a point where they\u2019re tired of telling you a behavior is an issue right? So at this point is it a possibility that now she\u2019s actually just annoyed or feeling undervalued/unimportant because you can\u2019t consistently manage your time leaving her on the backbench? Not trying to be jerk, but I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s likely that the repeated behavior despite your efforts aren\u2019t doing it anymore cause at the end of the day..you\u2019re still repeating the problem behavior.\n\nA million little pricks of a needle will start to bleed at some point and keep getting worse if the pricks don\u2019t stop", "If you\u2019re on mobile..go to your profile, click the 3dots in the upper right corner of the preview for this post and there should be an edit option on the selection list", "We are going through a bit of a rough patch already as my new job takes a lot of time up so I\u2019m sure this is adding to that area of stress. Thank you for your input. I find the YTA comments a good check.", "Thank you I added an edit", "Dude yea..wasn\u2019t saying it to be a dick.. it just kinda felt like there\u2019s a little more reasoning behind her upset ya know. But y\u2019all are also going thru a rough spot. And being long distance even tho y\u2019all see each other a fair amount it sounds like means all the time y\u2019all have is probably really valuable in her mind yea? So chronic lateness cause you\u2019re not out the door on time and hitting rush hour traffic(leaving at 4pm not 3pm) therefor reducing that face to face time probably isn\u2019t a good look after the 5th instance, might even make her feel like you don\u2019t value it the way she does. \n\nAt this point all you can do is apologize, and communicate like y\u2019all have been doing. Good luck dude!", "Thank you for your input. It is helpful."]}
