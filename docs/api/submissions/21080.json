Your dad had invited both of you after all.", "NTA you legitimately forgot and it's a family event you normally attend. She needs to understand that instead of trying to belittle you (read manipulate) for taking part in something you normally do with your family. Everyone's family dynamic is different you either respect what people do and let them enjoy it or take a walk.", "NTA, but I can understand why she's upset about a last-minute change.   Some people think an anniversary is just about the couple.  It always irked my MIL that her husband's mother sent her a card on their wedding anniversary and expected the same on their own anniversary.   It's just a difference between families.   Personally, I prefer most anniversaries to be just hubby and I, but I think milestone anniversaries can include other people, especially any children created from that union.   Why didn't you invite her to the anniversary dinner as your dad suggested?", "NTA It\u2019s not weird to celebrate your parents anniversary at all, it\u2019s more weird that your gf would think that way. Are her parents divorced/ not together or unhappy? It also sounded like your parents wanted her there, did you mention that to her?", "NTA and why be with someone who's behavior spikes your anxiety and is condescending. This is not loving. \n\nFamilies differ in what they celebrate. Instead of her being open she insults what your family values and how it is celebrated. \n\nYou made a mistake re: the anniversary; something you want to attend. You adjusting time together may disappoint her but we all make mistakes. Best to you.", "NTA. It sounds like you and gf might have different values. This is a big anniversary. Of course, you should be there. \n\nAre you chronically late or changing plans??? If not, then I am notngetting her upset.", "NTA.  This feels like a red flag, TBH.  Unless you're a chronic canceller or always changing plans last minute, then she's being selfish and immature.", "NTA\n\nIt's not weird.  And even if it was, who cares.  \n\nDating and having to give up every single weekend is crazy hard.  Missing one day is no big deal.  \n\nPart of being in a relationship is learning to respect the things your partner is really into even if it makes little sense to you.   I feel like she's being awfully dismissive.  \n\nPlus, ummm, she's never heard of an anniversary party?  Never seen one on TV?", "NTA. It seems pretty normal to me to celebrate with them. Either way, it\u2019s normal for your family and it\u2019s a bigger day. Postponing it shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal.", "NTA.\n\nPeople celebrate anniversaries, especially milestone ones all the time with their families.\n\nIs there something going on that you're not reporting?  Have you done this frequently?  Because I'm getting a seriously \"Main Character Personality\" vibe from your GF.", "NTA. Being a good person requires flexibility", "YTA.

You have every right to feel the need to prioritize your parents anniversary if you feel it is important to attend. However your gf has every right to feel slighted by your decision and to be disappointed in your choice. People have different habits and views when it comes to their families of origin (FOO). One thing that might be a good idea is for you and her to have a serious discussion at some point about what your expectations of commitment to ones FOO particularly where it might impact her expectations of you as a partner.

I don\u2019t believe she\u2019d make the drive atm.", "I should clarify they meant the dog and I. Yes her parents are divorced. My parents are also going through a bit of a rough patch so I think that may also add to her reaction", "I rarely cancel plans but I am late to things often. It\u2019s about a two hour drive to visit each-other and I\u2019ll say I\u2019m gonna leave at 3 and I end up leaving at 4 which puts me in rush hour which adds and hour or so.  This is a common area of conflict between us. Not just driving but stuff like this happens more often than I\u2019d like to admit", "NTA. Coming here to say this. Complete red flag. Find a local girlfriend.", "I do have a problem with dates and time management. Personally I think my time management is my biggest personal problem but it has gotten better especially since the two of us started dating. We are still leagues apart on that aspect though."]}
