Some people think an anniversary is just about the couple.  It always irked my MIL that her husband's mother sent her a card on their wedding anniversary and expected the same on their own anniversary.   It's just a difference between families.   Personally, I prefer most anniversaries to be just hubby and I, but I think milestone anniversaries can include other people, especially any children created from that union.

Then they call and want to show up after I'm asleep because they forgot a very important annual family event? I'd be upset. \n\nYes you should go to your family event, but also should apologize and actually figure out how to manage your time.

It sounds like my guess about this being a recurring(altho you\u2019re working at being better-acknowledged) problem was correct, with that in mind yea dude her being upset is understandable. Dunno how long y\u2019all have been together but you probably surpassed her acceptable range on repeat behavior(and I don\u2019t know the girl) but really, everybody has a point where they\u2019re tired of telling you a behavior is an issue right? So at this point is it a possibility that now she\u2019s actually just annoyed or feeling undervalued/unimportant because you can\u2019t consistently manage your time leaving her on the backbench? Not trying to be jerk, but I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s likely that the repeated behavior despite your efforts aren\u2019t doing it anymore cause at the end of the day..you\u2019re still repeating the problem behavior.\n\nA million little pricks of a needle will start to bleed at some point and keep getting worse if the pricks don\u2019t stop", "If you\u2019re on mobile..go to your profile, click the 3dots in the upper right corner of the preview for this post and there should be an edit option on the selection list", "We are going through a bit of a rough patch already as my new job takes a lot of time up so I\u2019m sure this is adding to that area of stress.

I find the YTA comments a good check.", "Thank you I added an edit", "Dude yea..wasn\u2019t saying it to be a dick.. it just kinda felt like there\u2019s a little more reasoning behind her upset ya know. But y\u2019all are also going thru a rough spot. And being long distance even tho y\u2019all see each other a fair amount it sounds like means all the time y\u2019all have is probably really valuable in her mind yea? So chronic lateness cause you\u2019re not out the door on time and hitting rush hour traffic(leaving at 4pm not 3pm) therefor reducing that face to face time probably isn\u2019t a good look after the 5th instance, might even make her feel like you don\u2019t value it the way she does. \n\nAt this point all you can do is apologize, and communicate like y\u2019all have been doing. Good luck dude!", "Thank you for your input. It is helpful.", "NTA.  She sounds inflexible and judgmental.", "NTA. What's wrong with her?

When a person practically hands you a red flag......", "So you\u2019re often two hours late? And the two of you have had many conflicts about it?\n\nI\u2019m guessing this is more about you not being a good steward of her time than it is the anniversary. \n\nYou say the anniversary is important to you and that you celebrate with your family every year. Why isn\u2019t it in your calendar then? You say the two of you have been dating for two years? Why wasn\u2019t she invited to this months ago? Why is this the first time she\u2019s hearing that you prioritize your parents\u2019 anniversary and celebrate with them? Did you not tell her or invite her when you did so last year? \n\nHer reaction was very poor which is why you\u2019re getting the comments that you aren\u2019t the asshole and, if what you\u2019re leaving out, is that you are repeatedly inconsiderate of her and her time, it\u2019s very likely that the conflict is less about this one event and more about this being part of a larger pattern of immaturity, lack of foresight, lack of conscientiousness, inconsideration, etc. on your part. It sounds like she\u2019s been far more forgiving and flexible in the past.\n\nThis is an ESH moment (aside from your parents and, likely, your dog). Her response was terrible. Your handling of this was also poor (once contextualized with you being late often). Your decision to post on Reddit and not recognize this as more than an isolated incident/ not include the info that you\u2019ve already been having conflicts over you repeatedly mismanaging your time in ways that negatively impact her is also problematic.\n\nIt\u2019s time to admit that this is a problem. Something tells me if you\u2019d been on time way more often in the last two years, had never cancelled plans or double booked yourself, and regularly tracked important dates and events she would have been a lot more tolerant of this as a one time simple mistake.", "No she\u2019s often invited. We have small dinners and it\u2019s not planned ahead. It\u2019s just it\u2019s our anniversary we are getting dinner at x but it\u2019s important to our family.

Until you guys understand each other's family cultural differences,  you will be butting heads", "I think it\u2019s kind of an ESH then. You mainly because of the time management issues and her because her reaction kind of sucked as well. \n\nI still think it is rude as hell that your parents didn\u2019t at least invite your partner of 2 years though & I do implore you to try to neutrally examine how they (and the rest of your family) treat her. Do they make her feel welcome and part of the family? Or is she an afterthought because it seems like she is an afterthought. The dog got an invitation before she did. Your family doesn\u2019t have to like her or accept her but it will put a massive strain on your relationship & if she was one of my friends I probably wouldn\u2019t have nice things to say about you and your family.

I don't disagree with her in her saying that it's weird that you celebrate your parents anniversary every year because I don't think most do - often it's just the big milestone ones like 30/40/50 years+.  But at the same time, although you are 'partners' you only spend about 3-4 days together each month.  It doesn't really give you much of a chance to get to know each other.\n\nBut in view of your constant time blindness, your anxiety, forgetfulness and the fact your parents are similar...

The being late thing is every couple months I\u2019ll be 45ish late to arriving to her town. Sometimes and accident or something happens. As far as dates go I\u2019m not late for those as we are usually already in the same town. It does happen more than I\u2019d like as well as her. The way my family celebrates is very informal. It\u2019s just a nice dinner my mom ends up cooking. You\u2019re right about inviting her earlier though. I definitely dropped the ball planning things which is an area of weakness for me.", "I'm curious how often she drives to you?

You just wrote that it happens often and that you say you're going to leave at 3, leave at 4 instead, and get stuck in an hour of traffic.\n\nIf you tell someone you'll leave at one time and then leave an hour later plus spend an extra hour in traffic that equates to being about two hours later than that person initially expected you. That's two hours late. If you tell someone you're going to leave at 3 and they plan your arrival time based on that and then you leave at 4 there is no way you're regularly only 45 minutes late even if you manage to make-up time and especially not if you then get hit with rush hour and lose another hour.\n\nThe fact that you're all over the place in the comments here and then in defending yourself against your own words is very telling.\n\nYour girlfriend sucks for her comments about your parents' anniversary and it doesn't sound like either of you are managing long distance well, but dude, I strongly suspect you're late and disorganized a lot more often than you think you are since you're now attempting to minimize your own account of things.\n\nI strongly suggest you reflect on what's going on here. Either you're very rarely late and your girlfriend has given you a hard time about the few times you were plus is insulting to your family or you're repeatedly late leading to ongoing conflict. If you're really saying you aren't usually that late and you're usually respectful of time the solution here is to reconsider whether a partner who is that inflexible and unsupportive of you is someone you should really be navigating a long-distance relationship with.
