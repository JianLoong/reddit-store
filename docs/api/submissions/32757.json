One of my younger sisters is getting married in April of 2024. She has expressed to me that she thinks that me having our wedding in the same year as her is \"stealing her moment\" and expects my fiance and me to wait until either spring of 2025 (not the season we want to get married in) or for a full year in fall of 2025. I am the only boy out of us 4 siblings and she is the middle girl so she feels like her life and accomplishments have always been overshadowed by someone else in the family. However, I do not think that this constitutes me overshadowing a wedding that is 6 to 7 months apart.

Lord no. Your sister is being over the top.", "NTA She can't decide when you get married. It would be a bit different if it was the same month or something but 6 or 7 months is half a year between the weddings. Also if you were to get married in Fall of 2025 it would still be the same amount of time between weddings.", "NTA that\u2019s just ridiculous.", "You do not have to put your wedding on hold for a year, (or more, if your sister actually does change her wedding date as threatened). Why do you have to put your and your intended lives on hold because of what your sister wants?!\n\nSix months apart on the calendar is enough, she doesn\u2019t get to claim the whole year. \n\nAvoiding nonsense like this is why some people just elope. Or have destination weddings, it really cuts down on attendees with opinions. NTA", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand people who think they have a monopoly on an entire year. The world doesn\u2019t stop just because she\u2019s having her wedding", "NTA. She can't expect other people put their life's on hold for her and claim a \"wedding year\".", "6-7 months feels far enough apart. But if she is constantly being overshadowed by you and your siblings, I can understand why she\u2019s upset. As long as you wait to celebrate until hers is over, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong. Like the showers, bachelor/bachelorette parties, all those events should take place after her day is long over. And don\u2019t spend her wedding events talking about your wedding. Let her have her moment. NAH\n\nEdit to add: weddings can take a huge toll on family. Financially, emotionally, etc. Having one big event in a year is a lot for some families, depending on how much they help. If your wedding means she gets less attention, help, people attending, then I think it moves you slightly more into the AH territory if hers was planned first.", "NTA.  You don't need to put your lives on hold for someone else.  Think about the days when families routinely had 10 siblings.  10 siblings on each side is potentially 20 people getting married.  Imagine not being able to marry in the same year and being at the end of the queue.  \n\nYour sister will get over it.", "NTA. She needs to get the fuck over herself. It's not like you planned your wedding to be the day before hers after she announced her date. That would be a dick move. Your wedding is several months after her wedding. There's no moment to be stolen at that time.", "INFO: is your wedding going to be really extravagant and big and hers more small and intimate?  Has she actually been overshadowed throughout her life? Are her accomplishments celebrated same as yours and your other sibling.", "NTA goddamn I\u2019m so sick of post like these where people expect the entire universe to revolve around them and their loved ones are supposed to pause their own lives. It\u2019s so ridiculous", "NTA. She needs to get over herself.", "NTA. Why do we see this sort of question keep popping up on here? What the flip is wrong with people?!? You don't get to claim dibs on an entire flipping year just because you're having some special shindig in that year!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Didn't you know the bride owns the whole 10years around her wedding date. Its utterly atrocious that you think to get married so close to her /s\n\nNTA the bride doesn't own a year, a month or even a day. She does not get to dictate that nothing happens in her wedding year in case it over shadows her precious precious day. Your sister is a brat. Congrats on the engagement.", "Where did the idea of a \u201cwedding year\u201d come from? My kids married the same year. No drama at all. \n\nNTA. I just don\u2019t get it.", "NTA. She's being dramatic. Go ahead and get married whenever it suits you. You can't monopolize a whole year. If you are really clever about the whole thing, you elope! Show her how it is done and how you get past all the drama.", "NTA it is unreasonable for her to expect you to postpone your wedding for such a reason. I can understand the sense of insecurity and invisibility that being a middle sibling can cause, but she will get her time and you can have yours.", "NTA. Her moment is over the day after her wedding. Someone needs to tell her she\u2019s not ready to be married if she thinks she needs to be the center of attention for a year. That attitude is exhausting.\n\nEdited to add that I can\u2019t imagine being in someone with this attitude\u2019s life. Can you imagine having to appear interested in someone else\u2019s wedding for an entire year after the event?", "I was on her side until the bit at the end. I was thinking more of everyone else and the expenses of being in or even attending a wedding. They probably should be at least a year apart regardless of whose is first. However, it sounds like she is demanding that she is first regardless of the time in between. There is also the issue of who is paying and what they think about it all. Is it true that her key life moments have been overshadowed or does she often claim this to get her way?", "NTA just plan your wedding.", "NTA you don\u2019t get to claim an entire year just because you are getting married.  The 2 weddings are nowhere near each other ffs.", "NTA. 6-7 months is enough time in between. Your sister can plan her wedding for whenever she wants but she has no say on your wedding.", "NTA. A bride does not \"own\" the day or month or year she gets married. This is an unreasonable request.", "None of that matters frankly. It\u2019s a party on one day, sister doesn\u2019t need to monopolize the entire year.", "Lol, exactly."]}
