Also if you were to get married in Fall of 2025 it would still be the same amount of time between weddings.", "NTA that\u2019s just ridiculous.", "You do not have to put your wedding on hold for a year, (or more, if your sister actually does change her wedding date as threatened). Why do you have to put your and your intended lives on hold because of what your sister wants?!\n\nSix months apart on the calendar is enough, she doesn\u2019t get to claim the whole year. \n\nAvoiding nonsense like this is why some people just elope. Or have destination weddings, it really cuts down on attendees with opinions. NTA", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand people who think they have a monopoly on an entire year. The world doesn\u2019t stop just because she\u2019s having her wedding", "NTA. She can't expect other people put their life's on hold for her and claim a \"wedding year\".", "6-7 months feels far enough apart. But if she is constantly being overshadowed by you and your siblings, I can understand why she\u2019s upset. As long as you wait to celebrate until hers is over, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing anything wrong. Like the showers, bachelor/bachelorette parties, all those events should take place after her day is long over. And don\u2019t spend her wedding events talking about your wedding. Let her have her moment. NAH\n\nEdit to add: weddings can take a huge toll on family. Financially, emotionally, etc. Having one big event in a year is a lot for some families, depending on how much they help. If your wedding means she gets less attention, help, people attending, then I think it moves you slightly more into the AH territory if hers was planned first.", "NTA.  You don't need to put your lives on hold for someone else.  Think about the days when families routinely had 10 siblings.  10 siblings on each side is potentially 20 people getting married.  Imagine not being able to marry in the same year and being at the end of the queue.  \n\nYour sister will get over it.", "NTA. She needs to get the fuck over herself. It's not like you planned your wedding to be the day before hers after she announced her date. That would be a dick move. Your wedding is several months after her wedding.

Are her accomplishments celebrated same as yours and your other sibling.", "NTA goddamn I\u2019m so sick of post like these where people expect the entire universe to revolve around them and their loved ones are supposed to pause their own lives.

She's being dramatic. Go ahead and get married whenever it suits you. You can't monopolize a whole year. If you are really clever about the whole thing, you elope! Show her how it is done and how you get past all the drama.", "NTA it is unreasonable for her to expect you to postpone your wedding for such a reason. I can understand the sense of insecurity and invisibility that being a middle sibling can cause, but she will get her time and you can have yours.", "NTA. Her moment is over the day after her wedding. Someone needs to tell her she\u2019s not ready to be married if she thinks she needs to be the center of attention for a year.

I was thinking more of everyone else and the expenses of being in or even attending a wedding. They probably should be at least a year apart regardless of whose is first. However, it sounds like she is demanding that she is first regardless of the time in between. There is also the issue of who is paying and what they think about it all. Is it true that her key life moments have been overshadowed or does she often claim this to get her way?", "NTA just plan your wedding.", "NTA you don\u2019t get to claim an entire year just because you are getting married.

She would likely say that about any other bride getting married in the same year, so tell her to go pound sand.", "Also, your fianc\u00e9 should not wear a bridal gown, you shouldn't have any flowers there and don't you dare invite uncle Bob.    /s\n\nNTA.

NTA and don\u2019t let her bully you.", "NTA. You get a wedding day\u2026 not a wedding week, month or year. My three nieces ( sisters) got married within 15 months from the first to the last.

You are spot on, total middle child syndrome, controlling AF.", "NTA. You should just go ahead and cut that shit off right now.

The middle child often gets overlooked, *especially* when there is one sibling of the group that is the opposite gender. Doubly so when the parents *really wanted* a child of the opposite gender.\n\nIs it fair to you that she wants the whole year? No, of course not, and you definitely don't have to cave to her, but I hope, at least, that you can see where she is coming from.", "NTA for overshadowing but to be a good sibling maybe make sure people won\u2019t have to choose which wedding they\u2019ll go to for $ reasons and if that seems to be the case maybe coordinate with your sibling to make sure that isn\u2019t an issue.  \n\nAnd I would encourage her to get help to process her feelings bc whether she was overshadowed or not that is how she feels and she deserves to not start off her marriage with that kind of negativity.  \n\nWithin reason support her as best you can and find ways to show her that at least to you her accomplishments matter- that she matters.  You don\u2019t need to move your wedding date but def find little ways going forward to show her.  It\u2019s the best you can do the rest is up to her to learn to heal and move forward from feeling ignored or downplayed.", "ESH. She does not get to dictate the timeline of your life. \n\nHowever, I\u2019d consider if she\u2019s worried about family travelling and having to either choose which wedding to attend or shelling out for the same trip twice essentially.

NTA", "NTA. \n\nApril and any time in the fall are really far apart. Also, she's probably getting married first, so why does she care? If anything she'd be overshadowing you (not really). This is not a serious thing to care about unless someone is getting married, like, within a few weeks, and a number of relatives live far away and couldn't afford to travel twice so close together or to stay where the weddings are for that long. \n\nI barely even remember what happened in April.

It is unbelievably selfish of your sibling to expect you to wait a year to get married because she thinks 6 to 7 months apart is too close.

I think that when it comes to wedding stuff, a couple getting married gets to claim, say, about two or three weeks before nd after the event for themselves when it comes to other close family members planning nuptials.  Not that they are entitled to it, *per se*, but because, yeah, they deserve a little time to breathe, and because events that close together can create logistical hurdles for guests who have to be at events for both weddings.  \n\nBut your sister is being extremely unreasonable.

Ultimately, timing of your life events is up to you.

Eventually he non jokingly referred to the period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day as The HisFullName Holiday Season.", "If she wants someone to move a wedding let her I\u2019ve HERS.", "The entitlement is strong with that one.", "NTA. Will all your life events need to be on her schedule?  My sisters and my cousins (brothers) both had kids 10 days apart!  She would probably have called it sabotage", "It's so tiring hearing about these bridzillas needing their wedding year.  Life does actually go on the day after your wedding.", "Also she\u2019s already getting married first!  This whole wedding year thing has got to die a quick death!", "I mean if it was closer, like the same month or so, many family members might not be able to take off work and travel for both events, so it is kind of an AH move to do that on purpose. But that\u2019s not the case here, 6+ months is plenty reasonable.", "I wouldn't say its over the day after... It would be weird if the honeymoon would be at the same time. But a few months in-between is quite ok.\n\nBut l think this is not really a wedding issue. She seems to have middle-child abandonment issues. So hard to blame her for wanting it now. \n\nAt the same time - that kind of issues should be sorted out with family therapy or just by being supportive and honest with eachother - not by vetoing wedding years :P", "Next they\u2019re going to try to claim the century!", "Must be a new thing.  My mom\u2019s two bffs had 7 kids each.  I remember when wedding year meant 6 to 8 weddings.", "I\u2019m a leap-year baby.  I have a birthday in 2024!!  My 19th!!!   Better not be anyone else planning a birthday (or, god forbid, a wedding) in my Big Year", "My brother and sister got married one week apart.  No one freaked out about it.", "I think six months of spacing is sufficient.", "Hers is going to cost around 80-100k. We project ours to be in the 15-20k at the absolute most, so no. Not even in the same state.", "I'm not that familiar with the Chinese calendar, but maybe sister is going by that and 2024 is the year of ME ME ME ME.", "God forbid someone gets pregnant now and gives birth in fall 2024.\n\nOP is NTA for sure. Anyway nothing steals any shadow especially because her wedding is first you may expect to have less at yours (people already bought presents for her and want spend as much money for you, if its a destination wedding some want even afford a second wedding in 2024).  \n\n\nShe has no reason to fear any of that. Shes first and if any postponing would only give you more attention.", "When this wedding year bullshit start? Only been seeing this past few months", "NOOOOOOOOO! say it ain\u2019t so!!! I\u2019m so depressed now!! Lol.", "My husband waited to propose because we had a ton of friends, all in the same group of friends, get engaged in the same year (and married the year after) and he wanted to give me my own year. I still tease him (lovingly) that it was really sweet but so unnecessary lol", "Totally.\n\nIt\u2019s a day.  I can\u2019t remember ONE WEDDING where I thought about it for a year or even noticed that anyone else\u2019s wedding was the same year.\n\nThey don\u2019t realize that while we\u2019re all happy for them - we have lives that happened before and go on after their wedding date..", "Actually, as soon as the reception is over ....", "Start small. Go with a decade first.", "Damn. I hope they had local weddings. That's a lot of travel otherwise.", "I don't disagree, but if that has been the case, it at least explains why the sister is feeling this way.", "NTA. That was always my verdict, but again, if she's felt ignored growing up, that would explain some about why she's being like this, especially if it's out of the ordinary. I would just advise to be mindful of what you say to her if there is more of a discussion with her about this. Converse, don't confront.", "They are getting more common. I swear i saw one with someone  not wanting a sibling to get married in her birthday month", "From what I've been reading about bridezillas, I guess they expect that their wedding should be the only one to take place in a certain month or year. SMH.", "Around the same time as the \u201cbirthday month\u201d", "Shit sometimes even before its over.\ud83e\udd23", "Yes, the majority were in our town.  From mom\u2019s perspective, it was more like a lot more flower girl dresses and rose petal baskets to make than she bargained for\u2026\n\nOp is NTA\u2026but that entitled sister?  Oof.  Middle child princess syndrome.", "Haha wtf?! \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah Ikr. I saw it on one of those Charlotte Dobre thingys."]}
