He wanted only his name to stand when it came to your son, and not your name - he can explain to your son how that doesn\u2019t constitute erased.

Thus, she kept her name, in part - via a hyphen. This is perfectly fine. But if another woman wants to take the name of her spouse, that's perfectly fine as well. What's not fine, IMO, is trying to paint that as her name being erased, which while technically true, doesn't tell the whole story.", "I didn\u2019t change my last name which my MIL was SO upset about.

And yes you can hyphenate or combine names but in our case we didn't want that, we don't like hyphenated names and combining our names came out with results we didn't like.

That name also begins with a letter at the end of the alphabet, which my dad also hated growing up.
