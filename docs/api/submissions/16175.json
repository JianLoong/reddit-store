NTA.", "NTA... thats Essentially the truth of exactly what happens.", "NTA\n\nThat's what happened. He can always change his and your son's name to be hyphenated like yours if he has an issue with how the phrasing feels.", "NTA. That\u2019s often what happens in our culture\u2019s name traditions (I kept my last name, but my kids have just my husband\u2019s, btw).", "NTA\n\nThere are other words that could've been used to get your point across but erased is appropriate.  And it is how you feel.\n\nSure you could hyphenate like you have... but for how many generations do you hyphenate for.. and what if both parents have hyphenated names.\n\nYou could also tell your son that there is no obligation for his partner to take his name or give his name to their child.  There's no reason the child can't take the mothers name (without hyphenation).  Or the child can have a completely different name to both parents.\n\nHave a look at how different cultures name their kids.  You'll find Indian culture is quite interesting depending on whether you have a girl or a boy.  Also in the profession that I work, a lot of women keep their birth name because it's an occupation that requires registration.  And it can be a PITA to change your name for it so they will have a professional name and a married name they use for everything else.  It's also a level of privacy if someone wants to look you up on social media!", "NTA, that\u2019s literally what happens", "NTA\n\nHe's 4, not a big deal", "NTA\nIt's true so..", "NTA\n\nI feel erased now, thanks for that deep thought.", "NTA. At least it is now unusual to be referred to as Mrs. (His full name). That was common once.\n\nI'm a lesbian.  I think if I got married, we would just keep our own names or maybe hyphenate.\n\nMost straight women I know have mixed feelings at best about changing their names, but do it anyway because \"it just means so much to him,\" him being the supposedly progressive man they are marrying.\n\nDon't tell me how progressive you are when you're asking your wife to replace part of her identity with yours.", "NTA.  You aren't wrong..............", "NTA. Patriarchy. Whatcha gonna do", "NTA it's true", "NTA. You\u2019re fine. This is silly that your husband is taking issue with the verb.", "NTA, you're right.

I see NO lies.", "NTA, it's true. Maybe you could have said it more diplomatically, but you needed to explain it to a 4 year old and he probably is too young to for a complicated explanation about how under Medieval British law, married women had no individual legal identity and couldn't own property or enter contracts, so they had to change their name because they essentially were defined as part of their husband.\n\nI've always found it interesting that in other cultures (such as Islamic and Spanish), even centuries ago, married women kept their surnames and control over their own property.", "NTA \n\nAlthough what you should have said is that it's because we still live in a patriarchal society.", "My mom's last name is one of my middle names.

If you aren\u2019t pro name changing this could have been a great opportunity to explain to your son that people can choose to change their name or keep both names when they get married or sometimes the boy takes the girl\u2019s name.  Changing names is a choice and most women aren\u2019t forced to do it (not sure how it is in every country).  Plus, where I am (us) the maiden name is on birth certificates, background checks, it\u2019s considered an alias and is never really erased.", "NTA. In some societies, the first born son was named the mother\u2019s maiden name in order to carry on that line as well. Especially true with late the 19th, early 20th century American \u201celite.\u201d That\u2019s why we started having all those ultra formal first names like Hudson, Anderson, Wilson, Prescott, Carter, etc.", "NTA. You told him the truth.", "NTA - this is why I made my maiden name my middle name. I was on board enough to change my last name but I still wanted that piece of me", "NTA. You spoke the truth. Seems like your husband just doesn\u2019t want to see it from his wife\u2019s perspective.", "NTA. Fucking patriarchy.", "NTA, I'm so over men who expect women to shield them from reality since it makes them uncomfy. It *should* make him uncomfortable, it's an ugly thing and the fact that shit like this is normalized makes it worse not better. He needs to grow up and toughen up.", "NAH. It was a weird word choice, but ultimately harmless.", "NAH:  But I would say you probably shouldn't have made it a gender thing. May sound shocking but some men take their wives names.

In fact, I know people that added their maternal name when they grew up.", "To be fair, it isn't actually a solvable system. You can't just keep hyphenating everyone's name past one generation. My husband and I haven't been able to work out what to do because there just isn't a fair answer (even if we hyphenate, whose name goes where is a thorny question and we both HATE hyphenation...)\n\nNeither of us is willing to compromise on the kids getting their last name exactly. Which is fair. But how does one resolve that? Switching off kids is a mess and doesn't create a homogenous family.", "Partner and I will portmanteau our names together. Mr. Smith and Miss White become Mr. and Mrs. Smite. We both change our names and then crush our enemies with holy fury.", "A lot of Nordic Cultures have very interesting naming conventions as well. \n\nIceland has names based upon their fathers' first names, as well as their gender. So a lady with a dad called Gunnar has a surname of Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir and her brother would be Gunnarsson.", "Totally agree! I didn\u2019t change my name when I married. My son has his fathers name but I kept mine. I think you should do what you want to do. People who act like their last name is part of some dynasty that needs to be preserved are ludicrous IMO.", "What was crazy was I don\u2019t have my family in my life, so when the chance came for a whole new last name and to delete the other I was pumped. But I had zero pressure. However, I had friends who would be on the fence and for some dumb reason that\u2019s never fully defined, their SO would get mad like it was a full on betrayal. Never made sense to me, since you loved them so much you wanted to marry them but now you\u2019re ready to write them off over a name change. Silly goose time all around I guess", "I knew a lesbian couple who both added their partner's last name to the end of their own, so i.e., Debra Smith and Lisa Jones became Debra Smith-Jones and Lisa Jones-Smith. I figured it saved them from fighting over whose last name would go first.", "Fight it. Burn it to the ground.", "There\u2019s a huge amount of pressure for women to submit to their husband\u2019s name, so calling it a \u201cchoice\u201d is pretty disingenuous.

It just should be more commonplace for people to be able to choose which name gets kept rather than it being expected to take the husband's name. \n\nYou can give your kids the hyphenated name, you don't *have* to only give them one or the other. Erasing the expectation of taking the husband's name is only an issue if you make it one tbh. OP NTA", "I\u2019ve seen exactly one couple IRL choose something else entirely for their family when they got married. I think that\u2019s cool if no one wants to hyphenate.", "Meh, me and my siblings are all half siblings, and we never found it a mess that we have different names. The older two have hyphenated names, my little brother and I have the same last name, my little sister had my dad's last name until she got married. It wasn't a mess, because we knew we had different parents, it was just normal for us.\n\nMy brother and his wife made a portmanteau of theirs, and I met another couple (years ago) who did the same. I found that a fun and creative way to handle that; like, if one was a Stapleford and the other was a Thomley, they would together be the Stapleys or the Thomfords.", "> Switching off kids\n\nYour kids have power switches? Cool!", "Good thing your last name is Smith and not Shaw.", "I like that, it\u2019s like when a last name was just whatever your job was. Like my maiden name was Woodman because along time ago we were woodsmen. That\u2019s cool", "Did I say it happens evenly no. \n\n The problem with mentioning gender she just told her child boys keep their names girls don't. So when he grows up and remember that line, what do you think he's going to say to his future partner if she's a woman?", "Okay, but what happens when my kids get married? Do they add a third, or even fourth, hyphen? What happens when my grandkids get married? I'm not pushing off something that's too painful for me to figure out onto my kids. \n\nIt's true that I think my husband is partly so stubborn because he was socialized into never thinking it would be any other way. But he would have equal right to feel so strongly about it if he had grown up thinking it was normal to take either parent's name, and so would I. So who gives in?", "No, she said *usually* the boy keeps his name and *sometimes* girls change their names.\n\nDo you really think this one conversation is the only time it will ever be brought up? He's four. There is plenty of time between now and him dating where he will learn that is not always the case.\n\nHis own mother's name is hyphenated. I'm sure he'll figure it out.", "They would get to choose as I said. If they want 3 hyphen or 4 hyphens then they'll choose that. If they want to take their husband's or wife's name then they choose that. If they want to keep their current name or even want to shorten the hyphen to one or the other, then they will choose that. Again, it's only an issue if you make it one.", "I'm mean you're the one upset I had the nerve to mention men change their names too", "You said that OP shouldn't have \"made it a gender thing\", and I had the nerve to mention it's *already* a gender thing. That doesn't mean I'm upset.", "Actually you commented how unbalanced it is which had 0 to do with what I said. \n\nAlso I also said don't mention gender because you know there's couples where it's not one boy one girl", ">Actually you commented how unbalanced it is which had 0 to do with what I said. \n\nIt actually does, though, because a vast majority of the time it's women changing their names for their husbands, because it is a system rooted in patriarchy. You know how the whole last name change thing started, right?"]}
