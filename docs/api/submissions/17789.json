I appreciate all the support. Even some of the more controversial comments did provide some great insight. I took a lot of these to heart, and went to see if I can fix things.\r  \n\r  \nFirstly, I called my father. Our relationship is strained, being separated and not seeing each other often, but he's made it to some of my bigger events since the divorce. Double digits, sweet 16, mostly birthday stuff but sometimes other things. He never wanted us to move away, just felt he couldn't handle a third kid at the time. I digress. I called him, and it went to voice-mail. I found myself crying into the phone as I relived the past two weeks, but I made sure to word it as \"mom kicked me out because I have a girlfriend\". He called back a few hours later and said he'd see what he can do to help, and will keep me updated, and asked me to do the same.\r  \n\r  \nSecondly, on Tuesday, I talked to Alannah about us telling her parents. Between people saying I should to get their support and those saying I shouldn't in fear of more backlash, it wasn't an easy choice. I was hoping worst case scenario, my dad would be able to help. And in the best case, we'd have three adults rooting for us. She was hesitant, seeing how things went with my mom, but ultimately agreed.\r  \n\r  \nWe sat her parents down similarly to my mom. When I say we, I really mean she did most of the talking. I was still worried things would go wrong. She started off by simply explaining why I've been here for over a week during class finals. We tried coming out to my mom, which created an argument, and led to me getting kicked out. Her father said he wished we had told him sooner, and \"I'm sorry for failing you two, for making this feel like an unsafe place to be who you are\".\r  \n\r  \nAlannah's stepmom and dad talked for a few minutes before coming back with new rules. They wanted their couch back. If that meant dusting off the air mattress from when we were kids, or just getting some extra blankets, they didn't really care. We do us, so long as it isn't illegal and we don't get into trouble. But that said, since I was now under their roof in a slightly less temporary way, I'd have to start following the same rules Alannah did. Curfew, grades, things like that. All of which I agreed to.\r  \n\r  \nHer parents are going to take us back to my house today. I want to give my mom another chance, I mean I don\u2019t get how you can just walk away from someone after your entire life. I\u2019m either going to get the documents I need, or my mom back. In the latter case, I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to go back to sleeping there quite yet. I\u2019m still hurt. After talking to my sister she understands and would rather me stay away if needed. My brother\u2019s a little confused, but says he just wants us all to be happy.\r  \n\r  \nThank you all again for your overwhelming support and advice.", "created_utc": 1684625083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ncees/update_aita_for_abandoning_my_siblings/", "score": 44, "replies": ["OP listen its not safe to go back.", "OP, please listen to the other posters.  It's not safe for you back there.  Please, please stay away and stay safe.  Protect your emotions and your heart.  Sending you hugs and the promise that it gets better.", "OP you should not go back to that awful place except to grab your stuff.  You deserve so much better than bio mom.  Your girlfriend\u2019s dad gets that and is trying to make his home safe and accepting for you.  Take it and run.\n\nYou will be a massive asshole to yourself if you move back in with bio mom.", "Don't go back. Especially DON'T MOVE BACK. It is not safe. Your mother has thrown you out. She can and will do it again.", "I\u2019m glad to hear your girlfriend\u2019s parents are good people.  That\u2019s heartwarming.\n\n> After talking to my sister she understands and would rather me stay away if needed. My brother\u2019s a little confused, but says he just wants us all to be happy.\n\nSounds like you were a good influence on your little siblings.  They didn\u2019t get that from your mother.\n\n> I\u2019m either going to get the documents I need, or my mom back. In the latter case, I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to go back to sleeping there quite yet.\n\nI hope your mother realizes how awful she\u2019s been and has a change of heart, but I would be careful about putting yourself in a position dependent on her again even if she says she has.  She\u2019s clearly relied on you more than she should have for childcare for your siblings.  That could be a strong motive to lie to you and get you back in the house.  Also, even if she has a change of heart that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s changed enough to make it a good home for you.  You\u2019ve got a place where you will be more than tolerated at your girlfriend\u2019s.\n\nGood luck!  I\u2019m rooting for you and your girlfriend.", "OP go back, get your stuff and stay at Alannahs, explain to your siblings why you arent living there anymore and reassure them that you still love them", "I'M SO GLAD FOR YOU \\\\(TTATT)/"]}
