I appreciate all the support. Even some of the more controversial comments did provide some great insight. I took a lot of these to heart, and went to see if I can fix things.\r  \n\r  \nFirstly, I called my father. Our relationship is strained, being separated and not seeing each other often, but he's made it to some of my bigger events since the divorce. Double digits, sweet 16, mostly birthday stuff but sometimes other things. He never wanted us to move away, just felt he couldn't handle a third kid at the time. I digress. I called him, and it went to voice-mail. I found myself crying into the phone as I relived the past two weeks, but I made sure to word it as \"mom kicked me out because I have a girlfriend\". He called back a few hours later and said he'd see what he can do to help, and will keep me updated, and asked me to do the same.\r  \n\r  \nSecondly, on Tuesday, I talked to Alannah about us telling her parents. Between people saying I should to get their support and those saying I shouldn't in fear of more backlash, it wasn't an easy choice. I was hoping worst case scenario, my dad would be able to help. And in the best case, we'd have three adults rooting for us. She was hesitant, seeing how things went with my mom, but ultimately agreed.\r  \n\r  \nWe sat her parents down similarly to my mom. When I say we, I really mean she did most of the talking. I was still worried things would go wrong. She started off by simply explaining why I've been here for over a week during class finals. We tried coming out to my mom, which created an argument, and led to me getting kicked out. Her father said he wished we had told him sooner, and \"I'm sorry for failing you two, for making this feel like an unsafe place to be who you are\".\r  \n\r  \nAlannah's stepmom and dad talked for a few minutes before coming back with new rules. They wanted their couch back. If that meant dusting off the air mattress from when we were kids, or just getting some extra blankets, they didn't really care. We do us, so long as it isn't illegal and we don't get into trouble. But that said, since I was now under their roof in a slightly less temporary way, I'd have to start following the same rules Alannah did. Curfew, grades, things like that. All of which I agreed to.\r  \n\r  \nHer parents are going to take us back to my house today. I want to give my mom another chance, I mean I don\u2019t get how you can just walk away from someone after your entire life. I\u2019m either going to get the documents I need, or my mom back. In the latter case, I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to go back to sleeping there quite yet. I\u2019m still hurt. After talking to my sister she understands and would rather me stay away if needed. My brother\u2019s a little confused, but says he just wants us all to be happy.\r  \n\r  \nThank you all again for your overwhelming support and advice.", "created_utc": 1684625083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ncees/update_aita_for_abandoning_my_siblings/", "score": 621, "replies": ["OP listen its not safe to go back.", "OP, please listen to the other posters.  It's not safe for you back there.  Please, please stay away and stay safe.  Protect your emotions and your heart.  Sending you hugs and the promise that it gets better.", "OP you should not go back to that awful place except to grab your stuff.  You deserve so much better than bio mom.  Your girlfriend\u2019s dad gets that and is trying to make his home safe and accepting for you.  Take it and run.\n\nYou will be a massive asshole to yourself if you move back in with bio mom.", "Don't go back. Especially DON'T MOVE BACK. It is not safe. Your mother has thrown you out. She can and will do it again.", "I\u2019m glad to hear your girlfriend\u2019s parents are good people.  That\u2019s heartwarming.\n\n> After talking to my sister she understands and would rather me stay away if needed. My brother\u2019s a little confused, but says he just wants us all to be happy.\n\nSounds like you were a good influence on your little siblings.  They didn\u2019t get that from your mother.\n\n> I\u2019m either going to get the documents I need, or my mom back. In the latter case, I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to go back to sleeping there quite yet.\n\nI hope your mother realizes how awful she\u2019s been and has a change of heart, but I would be careful about putting yourself in a position dependent on her again even if she says she has.  She\u2019s clearly relied on you more than she should have for childcare for your siblings.  That could be a strong motive to lie to you and get you back in the house.  Also, even if she has a change of heart that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s changed enough to make it a good home for you.  You\u2019ve got a place where you will be more than tolerated at your girlfriend\u2019s.\n\nGood luck!  I\u2019m rooting for you and your girlfriend.", "OP go back, get your stuff and stay at Alannahs, explain to your siblings why you arent living there anymore and reassure them that you still love them", "I'M SO GLAD FOR YOU \\\\(TTATT)/", "Aside from it being messed up for Alannah to tell you to come out to your mother when she hadn\u2019t done it herself, it\u2019s probably best to see if you hear back from your dad and keep staying at Alannah\u2019s house. I\u2019d also recommend telling the family your mom kicked you out, not you left. If she\u2019s willing to lie about how you left, she\u2019s lie about not treating you fairly if you move back in.", "OP, things are looking up. I wish the best for you and I\u2019m glad you have adults that have your back. Continue to be your authentic self. And be happy. \ud83c\udf38", "Wtf why is this upvoted so much. She has 2 siblings, a separated dad who is out of state and isnt involved in matters, how much will alannahs family help. What happens if things don't workout between OP and Alannah. She'll be homeless then. Trying to have a understanding with her bio mom is logical. Plus she's 17 iirc so legally she can't stay at alannahs house. Bio mom can just call the police to make their parents lives hell jfc.", "This was something I wanted to clarify in this post if I wasn't limited to 3000 characters after seeing people's reactions to the first post.\nShe wanted the two of us to start coming out together, that's why she was with me when we first told my mom. My mom seemed supportive, and her parents never really hinted one way or another until we told them. Telling one supportive person is easier than trying to tell two unknown people. Neither of us knew how it'd go, so I don't fault her. She feels awful about it still, but I'm trying to reassure her that there was no way of knowing.", "I agree, to me it seems like Alannah used OP to gage how things would turn out before coming out herself, which is a really shitty thing to do.", "while the girlfriends parents could cause problems if op'mom called the cops, the mom would also be in trouble for throwing out op, she has to provide for op until they turn 18.", "I\u2019m content to know that you spread joy and sunshine wherever you go \u2026 \ud83d\ude44", "It is NOT safe for OP to return to the mother's. Please remember that her own mother packed OP's suitcase, her own mother did NOT contact OP in any way, shape or form after she was kicked out. OP should get all her documents and the remainder of her belongings and leave.", "Exactly my point. You have 1 year till bio mom is obligated to care for OP. After that she'll probably be kicked out. In that 1 year she can sort things out, get a job, support herself. Now for things to work out she has to be come to a understanding with her mom. Even if it requires threatening of legal consequences of abandonment. And firstly tell the family the real story of why she left. Everyone thinks she left on her own and didn't get kicked out.", "You're right. But damn it I hate you for being right lol. Why are parents evil. If it's religious belief that people are only supposed to be hetero, then I'm pretty sure there must be something religious about not abandoning your child too.", "Be safe \u2764\ufe0f \n\nAnd update us again hahaha", "Yeah, going back with grownups to get documents and possessions is good.  Anything past that is a bad plan.", "At least alannahs family cares about the mental health and well-being of op.", "If she wanted the two of you to start coming out together, the onus shouldn\u2019t have been on you and you shouldn\u2019t have been the one to experiment on. I feel as though if it was her idea, she should\u2019ve initiated the process by doing it herself. You should be able to choose when to come out when it\u2019s comfortable for you. Her wanting to do it together shouldn\u2019t have fallen on your shoulders. I\u2019m glad her parents are understanding and supportive and you have a place to stay. But it was greatly unfair to you.", "i don't think she has to come to an understanding, it was pretty evident that her mother doesn't want anything to do with op when she packed a bag and didn't contact. As for finding job, support herself, etc, ahe can do all that at her girlfriends house and probably much better because she has support there.", "> I want to give my mom another chance, I mean I don\u2019t get how you can just walk away from someone after your entire life. I\u2019m either going to get the documents I need,\n\nI would call the sheriff and ask them to come with you to help you get your belongings.  If your mother refuses to give them to you, you will have to go to court to get them back.\n\nGood luck!\n\n> They call this a ***Civil Standby*** for the record.", "OP is most certainly going to get caught in emotional ties, and put herself in danger, because she hasn't realized there's no getting her mom back & being true to her identity \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "The support from Alannah\u2019s father is absolutely outstanding, he sounds like such an amazing dad. \n\nAlso OP I see a lot of people suggesting that you completely cut your mom off and ultimately it is your decision, but I just wanted to wish you good luck because I understand how difficult this decision is to make at such a young age and as someone who is also a teen actively taking care of a younger sibling (ten year age difference) I want you to know that I know your situation to an extent and your life and your goals MATTER!! If you decide to stay out after your mom coldly kicked you out you are not letting your siblings down in any way, start living your life because you deserve to act like a teenager/young adult and not as a third parent, they will 100% understand as they age", "Props to the dad's here!", "Yes but come on, they are 17. I\u2019m not sure she knew any better tbh", "Y\u2019all are 17, I\u2019m sure your GF just didn\u2019t know any better. This probably would have happened even if you tell her folks first. If she\u2019s remorseful, that means she willing to learn and grow for this so, in that case, don\u2019t be to harsh on her.", "thats why GF's parents are going too", "This! The mother is unhinged and could snap and get violent or prevent her from leaving or destroying or withholding the documents.", "You mean the deadbeat who couldn't habdle a third kid and thus abandoned all of them???", "Everything you have said is wrong. What do 2 siblings or dad have to do with the situation?\n\nHer bio mom already pushed her into homelessness had Alannah\u2019s family not been understanding. You can also legally emancipate from your family under 18 years old.\n\nSo many angry acronyms. I wish you a great day tomorrow but double check the accuracy of what you say before delivering it with such vigor.", "Better small something than disowning... neither mom seems to have stood out. In this case, it is what it is in that moment."]}
