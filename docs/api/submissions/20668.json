I'm 30m and my wife is 28f. We just welcomed our perfect baby girl in to this world 3 weeks ago. My buddy and his wife welcomed their perfect boy in to the world last week. We haven't seen my buddy or his wife since we had our daughter but yesterday we were invited down to their place to hang out. \n\nNow.. my wife was an absolute champ during delivery. I think she put up a good front for me, as I was admittedly not much of a support system because I let my panic get the best of me. But she was joking the whole time through pushes, despite silently crying. She kept saying encouraging things to me (as if I was the one going through it. Ie: \"you're going to be such a good dad\", \"she's going to be so beautiful\", \"I can't wait for you to see her\", \"I hope she has your eyes\"). She was sweet as pie to everyone. She just handled it so fucking well considering and I'm so amazed by the woman she is and her ability to remain so calm in that situation. Now my buddy and his wife asked how the delivery was so I did gush over my wife and how absolutely awesome she was and how included she made me feel, etc. \n\nI guess I should have known something wasn't right because I did notice my buddy start laughing and his wife was silent. When I finally caught on and had my \"oh shit\" moment, I asked what was wrong and my buddy goes \"she basically bit my head off. She was screaming at the doctors, told me I was a POS, said my son better not look like me after everything she's gone through\" etc, etc. I guess she just had a rough one, which is totally fine! But me gushing over my wife and how well she handled things thoroughly pissed off my buddies wife. We left later and my wife gets a text from the other wife saying \"pretty bold of your husband to basically shit talk my experience by talking about how great you did. That was fucking embarrassing.\" Now I feel bad, I guess.. for essentially not reading the room.

Like honestly, my SIL was a fucking mess for like 3 weeks post birth\u2014 she literally cried every 5 minutes for no reason at all. My sister was a raging fucking lunatic for a few weeks after birth, I almost gave up on helping her because she pissed me off so bad, but then she just snapped out of it one day. And one of my former co-workers cried about the shoes I wore a month after birth. \n\nAnyway, she was probably just embarrassed, and her crazy hormones are causing her to react in a really harsh manner. I do think this could be a good learning opportunity though, to just be careful about how many details you divulge before reading the room. With other brand new moms in particular\u2014 some moms have extremely traumatic births and they might just be asking about yours to see if you guys also experienced that so they feel open about talking about it, and might actually feel really hurt after you go on about how wonderful your guys\u2019 experience was.

It\u2019s not something you can really prepare for without having gone through it. \n\nFor all we know, focusing on her husband may have been the emotional touchstone she needed to distract her from the pains of birthing.

The only way to truly know the dynamic would be to ask the wife her feelings on the matter.", "Exactly this", "This! Frankly, the disparity of birthing (and pregnancy) experiences are fascinating. I know one woman who literally felt no pain during childbirth and have a cousin who loved being pregnant and claimed she never felt any discomfort until giving birth.

He feels awful, but he got help quickly and turned his attention back to me as soon as he could.\n\nAnd every delivery is different.

You try spending 9 months literally making another human, followed by hours of pain while pushing a 6lb baby with a 10cm in diameter head out of a hole that\u2019s only 3cm in diameter max, and do so without hurling a single insult at anyone. And even if you are successful at that, you should probably shut the fuck up about how other people handle it.", "Yes! My whole take on the story was why would OP *admit* that?

I would be **pissed**.", "Yea, known plenty of women that had hard births. None said anything like that. You don't make comments like that without some underlying shittiness, make whatever excuses you want. Going to THAT kind of thing in a time of stress is telling of who someone is.

Yes.

Your wife should have shared instead of you *bragging*. Maybe she would have offered a more nuanced view of the situation since she was the one who actually experienced it. You were just the audience and the emotional support person.  Besides that, it sounds like you made your wife\u2019s labor and your daughter\u2019s birth all about you.

It\u2019s messy, and it can leave the man feeling helpless as the love of his life is in excruciating pain pushing out a baby he was 50% responsible for creating. That, combined with the sheer messiness of childbirth can really mess with some people\u2019s head.\n\nI had several surgeries when I was a kid. My mom stayed home for all of them because she couldn\u2019t handle being at the hospital waiting to see if I was ok. It was her limitation. Does that make her an AH? I don\u2019t think so. My dad was there, and they went as planned.\n\nNow, knowing what he knows, should they have another child, it would be reasonable to expect him to behave better next time. \n\nIt says more to me about his character that he called himself out and gave deserved kudos to his wife than it does for how he reacted at the time.", ">because this is the 1% of time that she absolutely needs him to be the rock.\n\nYou act like he was the attending physician.", "I think you and I are on the same page.

He seemed to have no illusions about his own behavior.", "Yep.", "I think there's some paraphrasing going on here on both ends.... To brag about losing it????? He didn't brag about losing it... In fact, it appears he felt bad he couldn't support her fully. What he actually did was brag about how his wife was able to help him out.", "I\u2019m sorry, but what\u2019s the difference if she was giving birth in a tree stump or a hospital bed if *shes* the one having to comfort her husband?", "And you're so sure of that because you expect women to be aggressive and angry during childbirth?", "Pretty sure he describes her laughing and making jokes. That aside, he doesn't seem to mention pain in the slightest.", "well said \n\nOP bumblefucked his way through unwittingly outing how inept he is, and how much his wife overcompensates for him.\n\nThe other mom begrudgingly outed herself and how angry and mean she becomes in times of distress.

This seems more like the latter to me. It's not a funny cute story at a dinner party to talk up his wife, but something to reflect on and figure out how to improve from.", "That would make sense if he framed it as him not showing up for her and felt remorse for that not praising her for putting her own needs aside for him. It comes across like he doesn't understand that he wasn't there for her and how wrong that was and how much burden he placed on her when it was his job to be the support system.", "He wasn't being honest about a weakness, he was telling the story to brag about his wife, oblivious to the fact that it shows him in a bad light", "OP centered himself in the delivery of his child - both in the moment and the retelling.

All attention and care is on the person going through this excruciating pain and trauma to their body, and possibly mind. If you can\u2019t help the person giving birth and you\u2019re making them have to comfort and pep talk you, you should leave the room and gather yourself. The second he realized his wife had to spend her energy and give attention to his needs more than her own he should have left immediately to calm down. Then come back when you can actually be of help and not be a hindrance. Birth is awful, painful and stressful enough without having to keep someone else calm and comfortable at the same time.", "You\u2019re assuming it did. On what basis?", "Yeah I\u2019m sure it was HIM that needed the extra reassurance out of the both of them at that time. \n\nAre you this whiny in real life or..?", "Oh I totally understand the other wife\u2019s frustration with the situation. My own daughter was born by emergency c-section after 24 hours of unproductive labor and pre-eclampsia. My (then now ex) husband wasn\u2019t terrible\u2026.but he he wasn\u2019t wonderful either. \n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t have wanted to listen to some ditzy dude ramble on about how much his wife just breezed through delivery and had enough energy left over to make the whole thing about him.", "Again, I dont disagree with you that he was absolutely useless, in fact, he was a hindrance to his wife. But I can't see how this is related to the conflict he asked us to judge. \n\nIf you let someone down, I think it's perfectly fine to gush about how well they took the situation even if you fell apart. I really doubt his friend's wife was considering how bad his behaviour was when hearing the story, it just seem like she was bitter and emotional after a bad experience. And NOBODY likes  when someone treats their trauma as just another day.", "You don't know that he doesn't understand, you also don't know that his wife feels like he let her down. We all have different strengths and weaknesses, and anyone can panic at the worst time. It's not like he's telling the world his failure is a cute story. He's owning it.", "You're right, of course. She shouldn't have to deal with that. But as i said, reactions during such a time are often uncontrollable. I nearly threw up during the birth of our first and even though I tried to be supportive I doubt I was actually much help to my wife. \n\nShe'd have been well within her rights to bite his head off, but the way it reads to me is that she wanted to help him.  Maybe it took her mind off things or maybe she's just an all-around wonderful person. Either way, there is no suggestion that she was forced to perform emotional support. \n\nCould he have done better? Undoubtedly. But I don't think bigging up his wife for how amazing she was makes him as asshole and we can't just assume he hasn't apologised and tried to make it up to her since. If he hasn't, then of course he is an asshole.", "Not really. Aside from still being whacked full of hormones, imagine if you had a traumatic birth experience and it brought out an ugly side and then a week later your hudband's male friend was bragging about how amazing his wife was that she didn't even need his support - she could simply manage him and birthing and isn't she perfect and amazing?\n\nThe issue with that is it could easily imply that needing support or having the worst brought out of you during labor makes you inferior to the person who manages everything on her own. It's unintentional on OP's part, but absolutely inadvertently calling his friend's wife a worse mom/partner/weaker person than his own. OP is not an asshole, but the situational awareness was a bit lacking, seeing as most births are not smooth in any way and the effects afterward can make a postpartem mother feel like absolute crap.", "No one is calling him misogynistic except you. And yes \u201cwitnessing a medical event\u201d, not the one having it. That quite literally makes him self centered. If he noticed that his wife was having to calm him down and pep talk him whilst going through immense pain and trauma to her body he should have left the room and gathered himself so he could do the one thing a partner is supposed to do in that situation. Not just stay there panicking while his wife had to multitask while giving fucking birth.", "He told a fun story about his wife. We have no indication she wasn't okay with his behavior. That is also how some people cope, just something to distract them.

It's nice that you're spinning this as a \"my wife is awesome\" story, so I guess NTA for that, but maybe you shouldn't go advertising how badly you screwed up that moment for your wife, because while she's clearly forgiven you for it, it really just makes you look bad.", "YTA.

For example: my friend and I gave birth a week apart. Mine went amazing. But she almost died and was wheeled into a room to have an emergency c-section, where she was told her son might not make it. When we finally met up to talk about our experiences, I knew that mine went well but also knew that isn't always the case so I let her guide the conversation.\n\nIt may seem trivial but OP is a parent now, and it's going to get way harder and more important to put other people's feelings first.

While I'm healing after giving birth, I'll likely be taking care of him the whole time, because HE needs the help.

You're an ass for putting your wife in the position that she had to give you emotional support while she gave birth.

He needed to nap when we got to the hospital because he was \"so tired\" from being awake all night while I labored.\n\nI'm giving this an ESH for you and the other husband. Instead of making fun of his wife for being \"so mean\" as she delivered a baby he should have jumped in with how she was in so much pain she was going off but she was amazing and got through it. Both of you need to be better.", "Yes this is so embarrassing of OP. He wasn\u2019t good emotional support, he was \u201cpanicking\u201d, and his wife had to comfort him while delivering????\n\nAnd he BRAGS ABOUT THIS? \n\nDude /u/kitchenno7706 unless you\u2019re in one of those quiverful communities where women acting like just a birthing vessel w no personality are cherished, you\u2019re making yourself AND YOUR WIFE look horrible by telling this story. You look pathetic, and she looks worse because it makes it seem like she has no self respect. \n\nThe fact you think this story makes her seem amazing really cements how socially unaware you are. It\u2019s not just reading the room. Read the damn decade we live in!! Your wife couldn\u2019t express herself; she had to keep it in cuz of your panic. She had to cater to you. This doesn\u2019t make her seem strong. Not asserting yourself and catering to others unnecessarily is what people with extremely low self esteem do. You made your wife seem \u2026idk how to make this sound better, but tbh \u2026slave-like. And reality is that in 2023, not everyone sees that trait as an impressive woman anymore. \n\nIf this is the type of relationship that works for you both that\u2019s great, but again, I would keep it quiet unless you\u2019re in certain more \u201ctraditional\u201d circles. If someone told me this story, I would honestly feel so bad for your wife. And since pity is not a strong foundation for a friendship, I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re doing yourself any social favors being so \u201cproud\u201d of this experience out loud. It\u2019s like not very mainstream?\n\nEdit: all the men and women in the comments responding about how men are allowed to panic, it involves them too, reverse sexism or whatever, blah blah. Just no. The action of giving birth is something only humans born with female genitals do. The hormones are impacting the mom, full stop. The pain is hitting the mother, full stop. The vagina is ripping from one person only, and a watermelon is shoving its way through only one person. There is a space here for dads (or any other caretaker), of course there is, but rational sane people understand that there is a **priority order of care**. Mom first, and then the others. Ask a ER doctor if they would treat a father who fainted on the floor from \u201cpanic\u201d first or if they would treat pregnant mom first. It wouldn\u2019t even be a contest. \n\n\u201cEquality in the sexes\u201d, or equality in general, doesn\u2019t mean EVERY SINGLE SITUATION BECOMES ABOUT EVERYONE EQUALLY.

Sometimes I don\u2019t want to share my experiences because it\u2019s deeply traumatic and is a very personal thing to talk about with other people. I\u2019m generally very open about sharing my birth experiences because I feel that it\u2019s very important for others to understand what it\u2019s really like. \n\nHowever, there are times that I simply don\u2019t wish to relive the experiences and love to hear my husband rave about me instead. It makes me feel loved and appreciated when he talks about how I checked to make sure he was also okay, and about how I was joking with the nurses and doctors even as I was crying and writhing in pain while they prepared for me to push. I also don\u2019t think my husband having serious anxiety during my last labor makes him a terrible husband. If anything it helped me ignore the pain and my own fears of a repeat of developing severe pre-eclampsia and hemorrhaging to the point that I almost needed a blood transfusion. I don\u2019t think most people want to hear about how the doctor had to go elbow deep into my uterus to stop the bleeding, and how I felt it all while my baby was being looked over by a NICU team who couldn\u2019t make him cry. It\u2019s not exactly something I wanted to recount when I was having a bad time with PPD. I actually want my husband to take the lead and do the talking when certain people ask how my labors were. \n\nI feel that a lot of people are forgetting the fact that maybe his wife doesn\u2019t want to talk about her birth experience with other people. Maybe his wife preferred to focus on anything and everything other than her labor because it hurts and is fucking terrifying to think about even as you\u2019re going through it. I know that\u2019s how I was with my children. I wanted my husband to be okay and didn\u2019t want him to be feeling the same fear that I was feeling. He saw the massive puddle of blood at the foot of the bed and the splatters on the doctor\u2019s gown and face shield. He stood behind the NICU team as I requested to ensure our first baby was okay as I was bleeding out. The doctor called for emergency blood and told me that I may have to be wheeled into emergency surgery if the bleeding didn\u2019t stop. It may have been me who gave birth, but he also had to see it and feel the fear that maybe I wouldn\u2019t be making it out of that experience. I was aware of all of that with our last baby and wanted to make sure that he was okay because I love him and we are in this life together. So yeah, I love hearing him brag about how amazing he thinks I was during the births of our children. Sometimes I still need the reminder that I\u2019m awesome and strong and that I overcame so many fears from birthing our first child in order to even want to endure a high risk pregnancy to have our second. \n\nThis became a ramble, but I just wanted to try to give some perspective as a mother of a young child and a newborn baby.

It seems to me the OP was recounting how amazingly his wife did, and his own admissions of fault mostly served to amplify his wifes show of strength.\n\nI do see the toxic trend of making women always having to be responsible for all of the emotional labor, all of the time, to everyone around them. And then to have that be the case as well in one of the traditionally most vulnerable moments a woman can experience is an especially sour taste to stomach. I acknowledge that perspective.\n\nWhere it complicates for me is when you consider the angle of how the modern man is also supposed to be allowed to feel emotions and admit to mental health failings. If we want to change the definition of what masculinity is and modernize it for a new age we can't get all of the new benefits whilst keeping all of the old privileges. We have to give up the old to acquire the new.\n\nPart of that is letting go of the ideal of a stoic man who never stumbles emotionally. In return we get a man who can talk about his emotions and connect with his partner and understand her on a new level. Someone who will eventually be able to do emotional labor on the same scale as a typical woman. Someone who will want to do that and who will do so naturally, without being prompted.\n\nI get the sense that a lot of the comments are almost implying that the OP purposefully neglected his wife during the childbirth. Which I think is a bit too wild of an idea to entertain. Why would someone do that? Isn't it far smaller of a jump in logic we have to make if he simply failed to keep his cool? Then that's probably the more likely explanation.\n\nAt the same time I do think it isn't tenable in the long run for one partner to always be the rock, he will have to rise to the occassion eventually, sooner rather than later. But then again we should probably give him some measure of compassion and benefit of the doubt. And we should probably give his wife some measure of agency; if she doesn't like his behavior, she can say so, she doesn't need us to do that for her, she's an adult and an individual. Not to mention that we're talking about one isolated incident in this instance, not a trend.\n\nIt seems to me that in a patriarchy, the prevailing response to a hyptothetical situation like the one given in this post, would be to say that the man should \"man up\" and do his duty, and that is pretty much exactly what the response has been. What does that say about us? Do we not want to get rid of the patriarchy then? Did we think changing the patriarcy would only mean changes to the role of women? Did we think we could only change the things that benefit men? Is it even possible to change one gender role without impacting the other in some way? Aren't they intrinsically linked?\n\nAlthough having said all that I'm still not entirely willing to let go of the fact that OP's wife probably has lived through a lifetime of conditioning and cultural pressure to fawn when insecure and to always provide emotionally for everyone around her all of the time. And if that's the only reason she reacted as she did and then having her husband praising her for reacting in that way, then that is very fucked. \n\nOn the opposite end though, at this point that's probably part of her, and who are we to say that it wouldn't be part of her if she had grown up in a matriarchy for example, we could guess of course but we can't really say for certain. Because after all; there is nothing toxic about one individual being extremely nurturing. The issue arises when an entire gender is shoe-horned into being extremely nurturing and little else, and any outliers are punished for not fitting the mold. But statistics become meaningless when we're talking about one person, like we are in this post.\n\nI can emphatize with how caring for others can sometimes bring yourself peace and allow you to not focus on your own pain, but then on the other hand again: that's only up to a point. Eventually I do want my partner to support me, in some way at least.\n\nI also want to mention that the other woman's way of verbally abusing or punishing her husband during the childbirth is something I view as unhelpful at best, although I can sympathize with where it is coming from.\n\nI don't know, this topic seems nuanced to me and I'm saddened people are so unequivocal in their answers.

These comments are vile for no reason whatsoever, touch grass y\u2019all.\n\nSo YTA doesn\u2019t make sense because we\u2019re judging the part whether it was an asshole move to bring it up in front of them. When he had no idea how his buddie\u2019s wife experience was. \n\nIn which case NTA.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s bragging. It sounds like he\u2019s singing his wife\u2019s praises and giving her credit for being so amazing. While yes he should\u2019ve been stronger and more supportive in the past, what he\u2019s doing after the labour is give credit to his wife and how amazingly she did. In fact, if he made the focus of the labour tk be his embarrassment, that would\u2019ve made the event about him and his shortcomings, instead of highlighting what a strong woman his wife is.", "You really need to have a look in the mirror and think how your idea of toxic masculinity effects men mentally. No one can control what they will do in stressful situations, OP didn't intend to have a panic attack, that doesnt make him less of a \"man\".\n\nYou and the rest of the comments here should be ashamed of themselves.", "NTA - this is the best take so far.  \n\nTell them congratulations, offer to buy them burgers, assure the friend's wife she has nothing to be embarrassed about, say, \"the embarrassment is all mine for not reading the room, and how's the baby doing?\"  \n\nIt's only been one week, get her some iron-containing food, briefly apologize and reiterate how much you value the friendship, then change the subject to ask about their wellbeing.", "This is one of the worst takes of this thread. It's clear he did not make it about himself. He answered a question, and praised how well his wife did. It's not his fault that the friend's wife was insecure or embarrassed about her own birth experience.", "Worst upvoted comment on this thread. Reading comprehension is at an all low apparently.", "The fuck? Have you even READ OP\u2019s post? He was gushing about how awesome HIS WIFE is. He RECOGNIZED that his panic wasn\u2019t his best moment and put his wife on a pedestal for being such a godsend about it. He is NOT making this about him.", "My god this thread is insane, what's sad is many people, including you, have reading comprehension of a fucking rock.", "Husbands can have panic attacks too lol. My wife is an L&D nurse and has had every experience; husbands passing out, super supporting and calm couples, both partners freaking out, wife freaking out while husband is a champ, etc etc etc. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge day for *both* people. While I 100% think a husband should be completely supportive of his wife there\u2019s no telling how someone might handle it once the delivery begins and I doubt OP\u2019s wife has some kind of grudge against him. Besides, OP clearly sounds like he\u2019s self-deprecating intentionally and making his wife sound awesome\u2026 does that sound like a bad or selfish husband?", "I\u2019ve never had a baby, but if my husband was freaking out, I\u2019d prefer that over being without him in the delivery room for my first time\n\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019d respond to him freaking out but I\u2019d probably just tell him to sit down and take a deep breath and then get on with it, it\u2019s not a big deal, but I guess we\u2019re both very used to calming each other down when things get stressful", "You say this like doctors were ignoring her\u2026?", "Why dont you hope the OP does what his wife wants?\n\nAre you saying he should leave even if she wants him there?", "I wasn't terrified. That's a pretty blanket statement.", "This!! We don\u2019t know the entire story of how things went down and I don\u2019t think the point of this post was about how he acted in the delivery room anyways. \n\nHe didn\u2019t know how different his friends labor experience was and he wasn\u2019t intentionally bashing her. I think she got mad because she was maybe embarrassed about how she reacted (even though I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any need to be embarrassed) and was projecting. \n\nAlso not sure if it matters but I got the impression that the friend was like uncomfortable laughing, not laughing at his wife", "Toxic masculinity is a hell of a drug.", "agreed. people are being so hard on him as if he isn\u2019t recognizing where he fell short. and he is essentially acknowledging how his wife is a great person, even through such a traumatic event like child birth. and he didn\u2019t put down the other wife\u2019s birthing experience at all, it seems like she just got mad that she had a negative experience and her marriage is already falling apart.", "I think this take is so unnecessarily harsh. When we judge people, we should take their action AND intent into consideration. When my mom gave birth, my biological father was periodically leaving the delivery room... to secretly call his mistress. That's an example of a choice being deliberately made, that's someone we'd call an asshole. OP had a meltdown, which wasn't a choice. I think you're also interpreting the \"silently\" crying part to mean he was forcing her to attend to him, but I don't read it that way. Some people really do better when they have someone else to focus on (I'd have been doing the same thing as the wife - hiding a pain that's going to be inevitable so I can distract myself with someone else). We're all human, and to expect to know how we'll react in a highly stressful situation is unrealistic. I think we can extend him a little grace.", "One of our interview questions from our doula was how she could also support my husband during labour. We're not into gender roles and my husband is the primary caregiver in our home. He is the unicorn type of partner and dad who does everything and will think of us a million times before himself.\n\nHe didn't say anything because he felt like it would be nothing next to what I'd be going through, but I know he struggles with anxiety and want to make sure that he's also supported. It doesn't take anything away from me. Partners support each other.\n\nUsually I'm with reddit but I can't get on board here.", "Why are you and other people acting as if the guy had control of his mental status. \n\nGiving birth is extremely tough on women, apparently he had a very bad experience during labor which not only can happen, it is not uncommon. Dads can have traumatic experience and that by no means take away from the pain women go through. It is well documented that men can go crazy during labor because while the women are filled with hormones dads are only witnessing everything \"sober\" which can make things get out of hand.\n\nDads not only can but do faint, pass out, get lightheaded, get panick attacks, anxiety. \n\nOP literally can do nothing but talk about how he felt and how well his wife handled it. \n\nThis comment section is filled with people creating problems where there literally are none. Reddit loves to preach on men's mental health but when a guy claims his head got the best of him yall trash him for not being the \"man of the house\" or the alpha dog that controls his emotions \n\nHonestly fucked up", "Not to mention \"Him talking about himself\" was gushing about how amazing his wife was. Redditors will get upset over anything.", "People who have shit husbands?  It's like people here forget that couples that love and support each other exist.", "I\u2019m thinking she had a really good epidural. With my first I went unmedicated and could not even talk for the last few hours. \n\nSecond was a good epidural and world of difference. Still painful enough for tears but also able to make jokes and comfort others and otherwise carry on.", "She is literally in the middle of labor of course she is gonna cry", "The crying I did while I was in labor and during delivery was silent. Not sobbing or anything like that. And I was also cracking jokes, asking questions, reassuring my husband (who was incredibly supportive). Sharing my hopes about our baby helped stop my anxiety from taking over. I think you're making quite a leap. While it *could* totally be a \"woman couldn't even focus on her own experience\" issue, honestly there just isn't enough there in the OP for me to think so because of my own experience.", "Silently crying about pain doesn't mean she suppressed herself. I don't usually cry hard when I'm in pain either.", "Yep, I know more than a few excellent, involved, hands on fathers who were a mess during the delivery of their kids. You can\u2019t help if you pass out, get sick, or whatever. The first few minutes of life are a miracle, but it\u2019s the rest of the kids life that\u2019s more important", "Oh come on guys. He loves his wife and his kid, and he\u2019s proud of her. He was stressed but he was still there for her. They supported each other and I\u2019m sure she loves him and was happy he was there. You people are honestly so mean for no reason.", "Probably because he's totally okay with making himself look bad because he's so proud of his wife. Why is that such a crime?", "I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s seen as a crime that OP let his guard down and wanted to brag about how proud he is about his wife and newborn to his best-friends of all people\u2026\n\nJust because OP\u2019s buddy\u2019s wife had a poor experience during delivery doesn\u2019t mean she needs to be a tool to the people around her. Seems to me that buddy\u2019s wife is just a miserable person.", "I've said for a while reading comprehension has been on the decline. This post proved its dead and buried in the desert somewhere. The absolute grasping at straws to make OP a bad person when he admitted that he wasn't the best in the delivery room because he's, y'know, *fucking human* and not a goddamn soulless stoic robot is really making me worry about the future because holy shit. This is the saddest comment section I've ever seen.", "It really is wild af isn\u2019t it?", "40 hours! Yikes!\n\nI think the whole experience can be overwhelming. There's a lot going on. My husband can't see a tube of blood without getting woozy. We knew he wouldn't make it! I warned the nurses in advance. They laughed because he's such a \"tough\" guy.", "Dude, I was just like you. Wife had to have a c-section due to an infection and when I walked in, saw her pale as shit, cut open, I was petrified. I know exactly how you feel. \n\nEveryone's giving OP shit but I think you and I both know the father during labor is pretty useless and any \"support\" we give is very little compared to the medical team. We are helpless during labor and that's what hurts.", "I can understand being mean during delivery, people handle stress differently, and giving birth is off the charts... But no need to be angry at the dude that didn't know your experience or jelous at someone who had better experience...", "Yeah that comment above is crazy to me. Like that's the first step in an apology even. But people getting mad someone admitted a mistake they made? Pure insanity.", "It's so weird because the moment a man admits he was panicking seeing his wife give birth he gets blasted because... only the woman is allowed to show any emotion? Obviously she was the one going through that difficult process but are men not allowed to show their emotions anymore?", "Welcome to Reddit and AITA in particular.  This sub has some really bizarre biases.  At no point reading this did I expect the comment section to be this vitriolic toward him.", "Nah. It\u2019s basically a couple subs that are like that. There\u2019s some absolutely virulent misogyny all over this site much more so than some discriminatory stuff against men in a few subs.", "Exactly. I once went to the hospital for a major injury and I exclusively talked to my family about how they were, they were doing a great job handling this, etc. I didn\u2019t want to think about myself or the pain I was in because it would get worse. That\u2019s how I got through it without sobbing. That could just be what OP\u2019s wife is like, too. NTA.", "Yeah, it was pretty traumatic for both of us, but obviously more for my wife as she didn\u2019t get to see our baby until 15 hours after he was born and we didn\u2019t get to hold him until about 20 hours after.\n\nI\u2019m still upset with myself that when they pulled him out and were cleaning him and checking his vitals that I didn\u2019t get up and see him right away because I had a fear of passing out. The anesthesiologist was so kind and asked if I\u2019d like her to go take some pictures of our son for me. I said yes, but before they rushed him to the NICU I did stand up to see him, but it was still scary.\n\nI even struggled walking down to the NICU the next day. There are so many emotions that it\u2019s very difficult to control them all.", "Here's the funny thing. People in a relationship who like each other support each other. And you guys wonder why you're eternally single.", "You say \"medical emergency\" as though he did not have 9 months to prepare for his, literal, only job in the birthing suite which was to -not freak out- and to be of support. In fact he had even longer than that if it was a planned pregnancy.\n\n  \nDo you think it is too much to expect that in 3/4 of an entire year the person who is also bringing a child into this world should, as an example, desensitise themselves with birthing videos ? talk to dads with first hand experience to be prepared? maybe bring some sort of smelling salts or oils if you have a hard time with smells?", "omfg yessss\n\ndid you see the post ab OP\u2019s mom making super calorie dense foods for her kids and now they\u2019re obese, and the comments WERE BLAMING OP FOR IT WHEN THE POST WAS LITERALLY ASKING IF SHE WAS TA FOR TELLING HER MOM TO STOP FEEDING HER KIDS THAT FOOD\n\nLIKE MAKE IT MAKE SENSE", "Oh yeah, this sub will take anything if they can make the man the asshole, context and actual post be damned.\n\nIt's interesting how people are claiming OP made the birth \"all about himself\", but almost no one is comenting how the friend made the birth of the wife all bout herself.\n\nI know it's hormones and all, but the friend sounds like someone told her \"You look pretty today\" and her reply is \"Oh, you mean I look horrible all other days???\"", "\"Why don't men show emotions?\" and when they do, \"how dare you not be a Man\"... This post is very telling.", "Same here, and reading that response about internal misogyny makes me feel sad, when I'm in situations of high stress i do better by focusing on someone else rather than myself, the sense of \"control\" really helps to calm me down so i don't end up having a panic attack, i don't see how it can translate as me hating women of even myself.", "are you a narcissist gaslighting me right now?!", "also, look at people in massive pain in other situations. They don't react like that. sure they can be cranky as fuck but it's not seen as acceptable in those situations to insult or hurt anyone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that so many people seem to think its cool for people giving birth to do that is honestly disturbing.", "....why do you get to decide what's a problem for them? Why are you so sure it even IS a problem? Why do you decide, for him and his wife, that what he did was wrong? You say this would be traumatizing for you, therefore...you're claiming he traumatized her. Do you realize how self absorbed this is?", "Yeah, I had a headache last night and apologized to my SO this morning about being short with her.  Being in pain can make it excusable to be an asshole, but it isn't an excuse to do it on purpose or worse be proud of it.", "YES. At 5ish days postpartum, there\u2019s a HUGE hormone shift as your milk comes in and combined with sleep deprivation, it makes you SO irrational and emotional. No one warned me about that with my first, luckily by my second kid I was expecting it.

She just remember me rubbing her face and giving her forehead kisses.", "Some men can't handle seeing those they love in pain, the gooey stuff and all that labor/delivery entails.\n\n\nThat would most definitely be me. \n\n\nHowever I'm a woman and was the one giving birth. I think it's actually easier in a way because I was really busy and didn't see much of the gooey stuff because it's not in clear view for the woman."]}
