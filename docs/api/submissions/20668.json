I'm 30m and my wife is 28f. We just welcomed our perfect baby girl in to this world 3 weeks ago. My buddy and his wife welcomed their perfect boy in to the world last week. We haven't seen my buddy or his wife since we had our daughter but yesterday we were invited down to their place to hang out. \n\nNow.. my wife was an absolute champ during delivery. I think she put up a good front for me, as I was admittedly not much of a support system because I let my panic get the best of me. But she was joking the whole time through pushes, despite silently crying. She kept saying encouraging things to me (as if I was the one going through it. Ie: \"you're going to be such a good dad\", \"she's going to be so beautiful\", \"I can't wait for you to see her\", \"I hope she has your eyes\"). She was sweet as pie to everyone. She just handled it so fucking well considering and I'm so amazed by the woman she is and her ability to remain so calm in that situation. Now my buddy and his wife asked how the delivery was so I did gush over my wife and how absolutely awesome she was and how included she made me feel, etc. \n\nI guess I should have known something wasn't right because I did notice my buddy start laughing and his wife was silent. When I finally caught on and had my \"oh shit\" moment, I asked what was wrong and my buddy goes \"she basically bit my head off. She was screaming at the doctors, told me I was a POS, said my son better not look like me after everything she's gone through\" etc, etc. I guess she just had a rough one, which is totally fine! But me gushing over my wife and how well she handled things thoroughly pissed off my buddies wife. We left later and my wife gets a text from the other wife saying \"pretty bold of your husband to basically shit talk my experience by talking about how great you did. That was fucking embarrassing.\" Now I feel bad, I guess.. for essentially not reading the room.

Like honestly, my SIL was a fucking mess for like 3 weeks post birth\u2014 she literally cried every 5 minutes for no reason at all. My sister was a raging fucking lunatic for a few weeks after birth, I almost gave up on helping her because she pissed me off so bad, but then she just snapped out of it one day. And one of my former co-workers cried about the shoes I wore a month after birth. \n\nAnyway, she was probably just embarrassed, and her crazy hormones are causing her to react in a really harsh manner. I do think this could be a good learning opportunity though, to just be careful about how many details you divulge before reading the room. With other brand new moms in particular\u2014 some moms have extremely traumatic births and they might just be asking about yours to see if you guys also experienced that so they feel open about talking about it, and might actually feel really hurt after you go on about how wonderful your guys\u2019 experience was.

Different people act different ways during labor. There are people who can\u2019t stand the sight of blood/bodily fluids. There are people who can\u2019t stand to see their partner in pain. It\u2019s not something you can really prepare for without having gone through it. \n\nFor all we know, focusing on her husband may have been the emotional touchstone she needed to distract her from the pains of birthing. Who\u2019s to say? They got through it, they\u2019re both happy, and they have a perfectly healthy baby.", "Looks like this was her second child. Husband is the first \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, that was my take too.", "What part of his story made you think his wife \"needed\" to be a \"sweet wife\"? It came across to me as just the personality of his wife. Her nature is to be sweet & caring, even during a tough time, apparently. That doesn't mean she was required to be that way by anyone.", "I will just say that some women do behave like this and as long as they aren\u2019t harming anyone else with that behaviour, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. Maybe she is the sweet wife, and that is nothing to be ashamed of. If it works for them great.", "Dude calm down. It\u2019s not that deep.", "For a father, witnessing labor is kind of like combat in the sense that you never really know how you\u2019re going to react until you\u2019re there. Some guys handle it well, some pass out on the floor. For all we know, he could be the emotional rock in their relationship the other 99.9% of the time. The only way to truly know the dynamic would be to ask the wife her feelings on the matter.", "Exactly this", "This! Frankly, the disparity of birthing (and pregnancy) experiences are fascinating. I know one woman who literally felt no pain during childbirth and have a cousin who loved being pregnant and claimed she never felt any discomfort until giving birth. I was miserable during the entire experience.\n\nI would just say in the future it is always best just to say you are happy you are through it since you never know what you are walking into. But, agree, NTA.", "And if it was a contest, the panicking OP is not a clear winner over the husband who took the abuse and survived.", "This. I cringed reading this. Like his wife could have died. She had to take on an additional mental load, making sure you were okay.\n\nIn the future, I would suggest having extra support there or taking a breather outside of the delivery room. Look, things happen. My husband passed out when I was having my epidural put in. He feels awful, but he got help quickly and turned his attention back to me as soon as he could.\n\nAnd every delivery is different. Some are incredibly hard, and women can be impacted for months after the fact. However, it doesn't give the other wife to be upset. \n\nESH", "Right? How self absorbed can a person be?", "I\u2019m sure he will if you spend your labor telling him how good of a job he\u2019s doing", "It is normal. Both are normal. There\u2019s such a large gap in possible pregnancy experiences.", "Yeah, you need to chill buddy. You try spending 9 months literally making another human, followed by hours of pain while pushing a 6lb baby with a 10cm in diameter head out of a hole that\u2019s only 3cm in diameter max, and do so without hurling a single insult at anyone. And even if you are successful at that, you should probably shut the fuck up about how other people handle it.", "Yes! My whole take on the story was why would OP *admit* that? She doesn\u2019t look good so much as he looks completely pathetic.", "Well, probably because the post isn\u2019t about \u201cAITA for how I behaved in the delivery room?\u201d The people letting it slide, so to speak, are focused on the question at hand, not how we got to the asking of this question. Nothing wrong with diving deeper, but it draws the focus from the main inquiry to do that.", "It was worded confusingly, but I kinda thought he was the one silently crying while she was in labor which is\u2026", "That's fine if someone chooses to do that. It doesn't seem like their birthing plan was for her to be his emotional support due to his panic.", "This is what I do in situations like that. I need to be focused on doing something in order to cope. I hate the idea of just being left to dwell.", "He didn't say anything about providing a distraction, only that he was panicking so much his wife had to reassure him while *she* was experiencing the physically and mentally traumatic event.", "Well he's still bragging about it so", "There is nothing on which you can assume she was okay with it. Pot kettle black.", "Because she had to hold it together while he panicked?  That's not something to be happy about.", "OP says he panicked, I'm extremely dubious that silently crying while having to make jokes and affirm him was exactly what she needed.", "She did tell me that her emotionally focusing on me is what helped her through it. There's very few people on here who are trying to attack me because \"your wife wasn't able focus on herself when she needed to because of you\" so I'm trying to ignore them.", "Seriously, he was proud of his wife and complimented her while making fun of himself?", "I mean, it honestly doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s the rock 99% of the time, because this is the 1% of time that she absolutely needs him to be the rock. Yeah, she handled it well, but damn. \n\nLike can you imagine going in for some kind of risky surgery only to have to calm your partner down because they\u2019re panicking more than you? I would be **pissed**.", "Yea, known plenty of women that had hard births. None said anything like that. You don't make comments like that without some underlying shittiness, make whatever excuses you want. Going to THAT kind of thing in a time of stress is telling of who someone is. There's a line, and that's over it. There's a reason I quoted that specific one and not the others. \n\nYTA too.", "We have ZERO indication she wasn't okay with it. You're calling him an asshole over a baseless assumption, and as a result saying he's not allowed to gush about his wife being amazing in a tough time because he wasn't perfect and your baseless assumption that was a problem. that's stupid.", "My default reaction to stress/pain/emotional turmoil/difficult situations is to be absolutely hilarious. It\u2019s definitely deflection and it means I\u2019m basically doing stand up during birth. The thing is my partner turns into an amazing double act with me, while also being an incredibly supportive birthing partner. I can\u2019t imagine what our relationship would be like if I\u2019d had to worry about managing his emotions and needs while undergoing the most difficult experiences of my life.", "Which would be a reason not to make judgment on it. Which I didn't do. That's not hypocrisy, bud. \n\nI didn't judge OP based on assumptions about an older situation we have no information on. He did. Do you seriously not understand the difference? Do you not understand how \"don't make a judgement\" isn't the same as \"making a judgment in favor of\"? How \"we don't have the evidence to make a conclusion about that separate situation\" is not the same as \"here's a judgement on that separate situation\"?\n\nETA: Oh, and you're the same person that took \"That could've been caused by physical pain of birth\" as \"physical pain cannot cause mental trauma\", which I still can't figure out how you got from A to B on that one. Guess I won't waste more time on you.", "It was an easy birth, from what he said. And he's not allowed to be worried about the birth of their child? Cause its his too, you know.\n\nAlso, if his wife isn't mad about it, why the heck are you???", "When going through extreme pain such as childbirth, there are different ways of coping. Distraction is definitely one of them. You can\u2019t stop the pain on your own, but you know that it WILL end.\n\nAll we know is that they had a baby and that they both seem to be happy with the experience. Anything beyond that is speculating. Kudos to OP for having the courage to speak up to potentially thousands of internet strangers about a time when he wasn\u2019t at his best.", "Your poor wife.", "I\u2019d probably do the same. The good news is, now that you\u2019ve been through the process, you are both more prepared for the next time should you decide to have more kiddos.", "Good for you OP. Ignore those people. And good for you for loving gushing over the miracle your wife performed. NTA. Enjoy your growing family.", "This comment seems like a wordy way of saying \u2018suck it up, buttercup.\u2019 Who are we to say what\u2019s going on in his mind? What his triggers and phobias are? His story about his friends showcased the shoe on the other foot. Was that better? \n\nHowever, their experience isn\u2019t ours. He doesn\u2019t seem at all proud of how he behaved, and hopefully this experience will give him perspective for the next time, if they so choose.", "Horomones can make you say and think some crazy shit. It absolutely does not mean that there\u2019s some underlying issues, it just means that her horomones are out of whack, which is very normal for pregnancy/childbirth/recovery.", ">she was joking the whole time through pushes, despite silently crying", "Sweetheart, it's not about judging OP it's about claiming that other people are making assumptions without evidence when you are doing the exact same.", "An easy birth is still not an easy experience", "OP requested a judgment, I'm not mad about anything.\n\nOP himself says he thinks she put up \"a good front.\" I don't think she wanted to be without a support system during labor and, in fact, serve as his. She has every right to move on and not be mad about this, but if he asks a stranger for judgment, why am I obligated to agree with him?", "There is no such thing as an easy birth.", "If it was her choice and preference to spend her labor managing his panic, I have no issues with that. The post could have made it clearer that she didn't want emotional or physical support from him during labor and instead wanted his emotional needs to be the main focus.", "I mean, yeah. It is. She\u2019s the one going through it, not him. Like yes, it\u2019s his child, but it\u2019s her body and she\u2019s the one who needs the support. I mean, maybe you didn\u2019t know this, but women can *literally die* during childbirth. \n\nSo yes, suck it the fuck up buttercup. \n\nAnd is the dude who can laugh about his screaming wife hurling insults at him while she\u2019s in immense pain a better example? Yes. Some women react like that during labor, and they\u2019re going through so fucking much that being nice/controlling their emotions/controlling what they say for those however many hours is absolutely not a priority. So a man who can suck it up, realize that she\u2019s letting the intrusive thoughts win so she can focus on squeezing your child\u2019s 10cm head out of her 2.5cm vagina, be supportive, and laugh about it a few weeks later, is doing a great job IMHO.", "Nope. Things that cruel are not normal. The only people I've known that excuse things *that* cruel were already shitty and use tough times as an excuse to let it out. \n\nThere's a line. That's well past it. I don't care how much you and others try to normalize going over the line because \"but hormones\" and other things that excuse SOME behavior, but not that extreme of behavior. If your partner EVER talks to you like that, sorry about your fucked up relationship, but stop normalizing it for others. kthxbai.", "Sometimes people joke to get through pain", "Yes. I don't know if you know this, but birth *hurts*. Crying from physical pain can be a separate thing.", "You aren't obligated to agree. But what you are doing is making you statements with no evidence to prove your point.\n\nYou have no idea what her support system is. Maybe she hated her husband for being like this. Or maybe she feels comforted by comforting other people", "Because what he asked for judgement on was unintentionally making his friend's wife feel like shit. Not a birthing experience that already happened, and which both him and his wife were fine with.", "See, that\u2019s a mistaken way to think about it. There was no \u2018choice\u2019 or \u2018agency\u2019 here. That baby was frickin\u2019 coming NOW. Everyone concerned acted the way they acted. I\u2019ve watched both of my children be born. You really can\u2019t prepare for it until it happens.", "But you made an *assumption* it wasn't, with *no evidence*, then called him an asshole for praising his wife over that assumption.\n\nI'm literally saving your post so I can use it as an example of the bad judgment of this place lol.", "That\u2019s easy to say sitting in the comfort of our living rooms. \n\nListen, as a man I\u2019ll never TRULY KNOW what it\u2019s like to give birth. I can only speak as a father of two children. I get it. Labor sucks. It\u2019s also one of the most important day\u2019s in a couple\u2019s life, and it is incumbent upon the man to be as supportive as he can. I also get that. It\u2019s the curse of womanhood to bear the burden of pregnancy and the pain of childbirth.\n\nHowever, humans are human. They act in unexpected ways in new situations. I can tell you this from experience that as a man, until you\u2019ve witnessed personally the birth of your child, you haven\u2019t the faintest, foggiest fuck of an idea what it\u2019s like.\n\nETA (Posted too early): it\u2019s amazing that, on a sub that blasts people for inconveniencing others with a mild allergy, or with being 100% solicitous of other\u2019s emotions 100% of the time, that this would be an issue. The man was witnessing a messy, painful, protracted struggle involving his wife pushing a 10cm bowling ball out of a 2.5cm hole, and couldn\u2019t do fuck-all about it except to stand there. People are quick to judge men as deadbeats and \u2018not getting it\u2019, but HE WAS THERE. They had a HEALTHY BABY, and they BOTH were HAPPY. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but being able to birth a child doesn\u2019t give one the right to judge the INVOLUNTARY reaction of a man who has never seen this before.", "Here\u2019s the thing though. It\u2019s totally different for everyone. My half sisters mom had a nearly painless birth. My mom had an incredibly painful birth. My other half sisters mom had a pretty average birth. \n\nIt really isn\u2019t as horrendous as people make it out to be. If it was, there wouldn\u2019t be so many people doing it.", "You don't think that physical agony is also mentally traumatic?", "Yes, and I shared what I would think if someone shared how proud he was that his wife had to focus on emotionally supporting him while she was in labor.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I am going to maintain the idea that you should treat it like your wife is going in for a risky surgery\u2014 yes, it\u2019s fine if you freak out a little, but if you can\u2019t pull yourself together enough so you can avoid putting your wife in a position to have to look out for you when she\u2019s the one going through the hard shit, you\u2019re an asshole.", "Yeah, you can fuck right off with that entire comment. \n\n1. There is no such thing as a painless birth. Pain is relative. So when a woman tells you that they had a \u201cvirtually painless birth\u201d they don\u2019t mean literally no pain. They mean painless relative to either what they were expecting or what they experienced elsewhere. \n\n2. People still having babies does not at all mean that it\u2019s a fucking cake walk.\n\nAnd absolutely none of this negates what I\u2019ve been saying: that she\u2019s the one going through childbirth, so she is the one that should be supported. Not the other way around.", ">It really isn\u2019t as horrendous as people make it out to be. If it was, there wouldn\u2019t be so many people doing it.\n\nLOLLLLLLLLLLLLLL\n\nah yes, childbirth is not painful at all, said THIS GUY LOLLL\n\n'nearly painless childbirth' = incredibly fucking painful\n\nwhat planet are you on? lol", "How am I not surprised that the person with this juvenile hot take has only their and their siblings' moms as reference for childbirth experiences? You may feel differently when your peers are old enough to start giving birth themselves.", "??? What are you talking about? That's not even remotely close to what I said. Did you reply to the wrong comment?\n\nI absolutely think physical agony can be mentally traumatic and that in no way counters what I've said.", "\"omg u praised ur partner for being supportive in a tough time. WHAT AN ASSHOLE!\" \n\nfucking rofl. Yes, how dare he share a story that highlights his wife being amazing where he wasn't a shining star. Imagine the focus of his praise of his wife being his wife. What. an. asshole.", "And I would call someone who presupposes how someone should react to what is essentially a traumatic, frightening experience an asshole.", "Bro everyone is different. Some people have legitimately experienced little to no pain.", "Earth you moron. Everyone has wildly different experiences with birth. It\u2019s quite interesting actually.", "Perhaps you\u2019re right. But, everyone has wildly different birth experiences, and it\u2019s LITERALLY BEING TALKED ABOUT IN THIS POST", "Again, pain is relative.", "You should probably sit this one out, kid. You don't have to weigh in on everything, especially things you have zero experience with.", "Pain is relative to an extent, yeah. But I\u2019m sure everyone would agree that being shot is painful.", "You seem to be an incredibly intelligent individual who truly knows a lot, perhaps you could teach me some of that amazing and unending knowledge?"]}
