I'm 30m and my wife is 28f. We just welcomed our perfect baby girl in to this world 3 weeks ago. My buddy and his wife welcomed their perfect boy in to the world last week. We haven't seen my buddy or his wife since we had our daughter but yesterday we were invited down to their place to hang out. \n\nNow.. my wife was an absolute champ during delivery. I think she put up a good front for me, as I was admittedly not much of a support system because I let my panic get the best of me. But she was joking the whole time through pushes, despite silently crying. She kept saying encouraging things to me (as if I was the one going through it. Ie: \"you're going to be such a good dad\", \"she's going to be so beautiful\", \"I can't wait for you to see her\", \"I hope she has your eyes\"). She was sweet as pie to everyone. She just handled it so fucking well considering and I'm so amazed by the woman she is and her ability to remain so calm in that situation. Now my buddy and his wife asked how the delivery was so I did gush over my wife and how absolutely awesome she was and how included she made me feel, etc. \n\nI guess I should have known something wasn't right because I did notice my buddy start laughing and his wife was silent. When I finally caught on and had my \"oh shit\" moment, I asked what was wrong and my buddy goes \"she basically bit my head off. She was screaming at the doctors, told me I was a POS, said my son better not look like me after everything she's gone through\" etc, etc. I guess she just had a rough one, which is totally fine! But me gushing over my wife and how well she handled things thoroughly pissed off my buddies wife. We left later and my wife gets a text from the other wife saying \"pretty bold of your husband to basically shit talk my experience by talking about how great you did. That was fucking embarrassing.\" Now I feel bad, I guess.. for essentially not reading the room.

Like honestly, my SIL was a fucking mess for like 3 weeks post birth\u2014 she literally cried every 5 minutes for no reason at all. My sister was a raging fucking lunatic for a few weeks after birth, I almost gave up on helping her because she pissed me off so bad, but then she just snapped out of it one day. And one of my former co-workers cried about the shoes I wore a month after birth. \n\nAnyway, she was probably just embarrassed, and her crazy hormones are causing her to react in a really harsh manner. I do think this could be a good learning opportunity though, to just be careful about how many details you divulge before reading the room. With other brand new moms in particular\u2014 some moms have extremely traumatic births and they might just be asking about yours to see if you guys also experienced that so they feel open about talking about it, and might actually feel really hurt after you go on about how wonderful your guys\u2019 experience was.

It\u2019s not something you can really prepare for without having gone through it. \n\nFor all we know, focusing on her husband may have been the emotional touchstone she needed to distract her from the pains of birthing.

The only way to truly know the dynamic would be to ask the wife her feelings on the matter.", "Exactly this", "This! Frankly, the disparity of birthing (and pregnancy) experiences are fascinating. I know one woman who literally felt no pain during childbirth and have a cousin who loved being pregnant and claimed she never felt any discomfort until giving birth.

He feels awful, but he got help quickly and turned his attention back to me as soon as he could.\n\nAnd every delivery is different.

You try spending 9 months literally making another human, followed by hours of pain while pushing a 6lb baby with a 10cm in diameter head out of a hole that\u2019s only 3cm in diameter max, and do so without hurling a single insult at anyone. And even if you are successful at that, you should probably shut the fuck up about how other people handle it.", "Yes! My whole take on the story was why would OP *admit* that?

I would be **pissed**.", "Yea, known plenty of women that had hard births. None said anything like that. You don't make comments like that without some underlying shittiness, make whatever excuses you want. Going to THAT kind of thing in a time of stress is telling of who someone is.

Yes.

Your wife should have shared instead of you *bragging*. Maybe she would have offered a more nuanced view of the situation since she was the one who actually experienced it. You were just the audience and the emotional support person.  Besides that, it sounds like you made your wife\u2019s labor and your daughter\u2019s birth all about you.

It\u2019s messy, and it can leave the man feeling helpless as the love of his life is in excruciating pain pushing out a baby he was 50% responsible for creating. That, combined with the sheer messiness of childbirth can really mess with some people\u2019s head.\n\nI had several surgeries when I was a kid. My mom stayed home for all of them because she couldn\u2019t handle being at the hospital waiting to see if I was ok. It was her limitation. Does that make her an AH? I don\u2019t think so. My dad was there, and they went as planned.\n\nNow, knowing what he knows, should they have another child, it would be reasonable to expect him to behave better next time. \n\nIt says more to me about his character that he called himself out and gave deserved kudos to his wife than it does for how he reacted at the time.", ">because this is the 1% of time that she absolutely needs him to be the rock.\n\nYou act like he was the attending physician.", "I think you and I are on the same page.

He seemed to have no illusions about his own behavior.", "Yep.", "I think there's some paraphrasing going on here on both ends.... To brag about losing it????? He didn't brag about losing it... In fact, it appears he felt bad he couldn't support her fully. What he actually did was brag about how his wife was able to help him out.", "I\u2019m sorry, but what\u2019s the difference if she was giving birth in a tree stump or a hospital bed if *shes* the one having to comfort her husband?", "And you're so sure of that because you expect women to be aggressive and angry during childbirth?", "Pretty sure he describes her laughing and making jokes. That aside, he doesn't seem to mention pain in the slightest.", "well said \n\nOP bumblefucked his way through unwittingly outing how inept he is, and how much his wife overcompensates for him.\n\nThe other mom begrudgingly outed herself and how angry and mean she becomes in times of distress.

This seems more like the latter to me. It's not a funny cute story at a dinner party to talk up his wife, but something to reflect on and figure out how to improve from.", "That would make sense if he framed it as him not showing up for her and felt remorse for that not praising her for putting her own needs aside for him. It comes across like he doesn't understand that he wasn't there for her and how wrong that was and how much burden he placed on her when it was his job to be the support system.", "He wasn't being honest about a weakness, he was telling the story to brag about his wife, oblivious to the fact that it shows him in a bad light", "OP centered himself in the delivery of his child - both in the moment and the retelling.

Birth is awful, painful and stressful enough without having to keep someone else calm and comfortable at the same time.", "You\u2019re assuming it did. On what basis?", "Yeah I\u2019m sure it was HIM that needed the extra reassurance out of the both of them at that time. \n\nAre you this whiny in real life or..?", "Oh I totally understand the other wife\u2019s frustration with the situation. My own daughter was born by emergency c-section after 24 hours of unproductive labor and pre-eclampsia. My (then now ex) husband wasn\u2019t terrible\u2026.but he he wasn\u2019t wonderful either. \n\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t have wanted to listen to some ditzy dude ramble on about how much his wife just breezed through delivery and had enough energy left over to make the whole thing about him.", "Again, I dont disagree with you that he was absolutely useless, in fact, he was a hindrance to his wife. But I can't see how this is related to the conflict he asked us to judge. \n\nIf you let someone down, I think it's perfectly fine to gush about how well they took the situation even if you fell apart. I really doubt his friend's wife was considering how bad his behaviour was when hearing the story, it just seem like she was bitter and emotional after a bad experience. And NOBODY likes  when someone treats their trauma as just another day.", "You don't know that he doesn't understand, you also don't know that his wife feels like he let her down. We all have different strengths and weaknesses, and anyone can panic at the worst time. It's not like he's telling the world his failure is a cute story. He's owning it.", "You're right, of course. She shouldn't have to deal with that. But as i said, reactions during such a time are often uncontrollable. I nearly threw up during the birth of our first and even though I tried to be supportive I doubt I was actually much help to my wife. \n\nShe'd have been well within her rights to bite his head off, but the way it reads to me is that she wanted to help him.  Maybe it took her mind off things or maybe she's just an all-around wonderful person. Either way, there is no suggestion that she was forced to perform emotional support. \n\nCould he have done better? Undoubtedly. But I don't think bigging up his wife for how amazing she was makes him as asshole and we can't just assume he hasn't apologised and tried to make it up to her since. If he hasn't, then of course he is an asshole.", "Not really. Aside from still being whacked full of hormones, imagine if you had a traumatic birth experience and it brought out an ugly side and then a week later your hudband's male friend was bragging about how amazing his wife was that she didn't even need his support - she could simply manage him and birthing and isn't she perfect and amazing?\n\nThe issue with that is it could easily imply that needing support or having the worst brought out of you during labor makes you inferior to the person who manages everything on her own. It's unintentional on OP's part, but absolutely inadvertently calling his friend's wife a worse mom/partner/weaker person than his own. OP is not an asshole, but the situational awareness was a bit lacking, seeing as most births are not smooth in any way and the effects afterward can make a postpartem mother feel like absolute crap.", "No one is calling him misogynistic except you. And yes \u201cwitnessing a medical event\u201d, not the one having it. That quite literally makes him self centered. If he noticed that his wife was having to calm him down and pep talk him whilst going through immense pain and trauma to her body he should have left the room and gathered himself so he could do the one thing a partner is supposed to do in that situation. Not just stay there panicking while his wife had to multitask while giving fucking birth.", "He told a fun story about his wife. We have no indication she wasn't okay with his behavior. That is also how some people cope, just something to distract them. I didn't say he was \"the one that needed extra reassurance.\" That's a straw man, because you don't have a real argument based on the facts presented. Just on your baseless assumptions and twisting of words.\n\nDo you regularly find yourself getting butthurt on the behalf of people you don't know, who themselves don't seem to have minded what you were butthurt about?"]}
