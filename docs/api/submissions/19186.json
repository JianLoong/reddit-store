Your mother sounds like a controlling asshole who exploits people's fears of familial breakdown to extort them. It sounds like she threatened the ol' \"I'll take your kids and you'll never see them again, I'll tell the judge you violated me and are abusive,\" etc etc. So, at the point where she's being given all of the perks of being married to him while likely giving nothing in return I can't really blame him for finding outlets for sexual or romantic affection elsewhere. It's shitty, but shitty in a not too dissimilar fashion from an abuse victim who cheats as an escape. That might be a tad overly hyperbolic, but I stand by the comparison.\n\nAlso it created such beautiful posthumous dirt to completely humiliate your mother indirectly, so...\n\nNTA because, frankly it was his wish, and your mother wasn't deserving of a pleasant lie that preserves her reputation.

It's not like you wrote it. You just carried out your dying father's final wish.", "So you think your mom was a shitty wife because she didn't want to have sex? Do you even know why? Was it because your dad was already cheating? Did she have post partum depression? Early menopause? Other health issues? \n\nIt seems like you think your mom is a bad person for not having sex with your dad but you don't give any reason for it or why this makes her a shitty mom. \n\nBecause that's the only reason why you would read the eulogy: to get back at her. And I think that's what your dad wanted too. \n\nMaybe it was deserved but unless you give more info: yta", "Yta I think you are too immature to understand life and relationships and the relationship your parents had and you likely never will be able to grow bc of your genetics. There are so many scenarios you don\u2019t consider Imagine choosing someone over other people and buidling a life with someone putting your life on hold and all of the things you could have done and putting your body through the stress of having and creating 3 lives and then your partner cheats on you. Over and over again. Disrespects you, causes you to have STDs spends the money you both have a right to on other women, would you be dying to have sex with them again? Or would you say you do your thing and I\u2019ll raise our kids like you promised me we would do. You would blame her for doing so? And then after he dies your son that you created that you pushed out screaming says nasty things about you in the funeral of a man he couldn\u2019t even begin to know the way you do. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what happened but your dad was an adult and if he was unhappy with the arrangement he could have left to be with one of those other women but likely he enjoyed having a maid and childcare and a caretaker when he is sick and all the million things women do for men. So imo you\u2019re Garbage.", "NTA.  I hope had your dad not gotten sick he would have left now that your youngest sibling is 18, but in any case, at least he \"freed\" himself in death.  I hope you and your siblings can remember him for the good things he did and tried and find some peace and healthy relationships in your future.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f he sounds like someone who tried to make the best of bad situations", "NTA... there is a guy who made a business out of doing exactly this. Good on you for honoring your Dad who was a great Dad to you. The equivalent of the old joke about bury me upside down so everyone can kiss my ass.", "NTA. Your Mom's just shitty that she's been exposed.", "NTA.\n\nThe truth always comes out. Your mom and her parents are just violently embarrassed that their dirty laundry has been aired.

If it's for the dead, then he should've read it because that's what his dad wanted.\n\nIf it's for the living, then it's a chance to celebrate the deceased and say goodbye. What better way to do that than to hear his words one last time?\n\nThe mum is an asshole who wanted to control OP's dad whilst denying his needs. She obviously isn't going to respect his last wishes.\n\nOP, you're NTA, and I'm sorry for your loss.", "As well, everyone here saying NTA is just assuming what OP reported about the relationship is 100% factual and correct. We don't necessarily know the full story here so if the eulogy said shit like \"My wife wouldn't fuck me for no reason so I fucked loads of other women\" when she may have initially had a legitimate reason (e.g. a traumatic child birth that made it physically painful to have sex. Again, just an example not saying this actually happened), of course she and her parents would be unhappy.\n\nAnyway, even if it were the case that OP's mom denied his dad sex for no reason, the decent thing to do is leave, not cheat on her with multiple women. That's a horrible way to treat the person you made the decision to commit to for the rest of your life. It's on his mom that she was seemingly so obsessed about making him stay though.\n\nCompletely rubs me the wrong way that people are essentially giving OP's dad a pass because OP's mom wouldn't let him get some and was controlling so she *totally* deserved the decades of cheating and having her private issues publicly aired to everyone who knows her.", "Yes, the relationship between his parents was between them. Is his mother a good parent? If so, I hope it was worth humiliating her and risk being cut off from her.", "I think my mom was a shitty wife because she threatened to go to the cops and accuse him of abuse if he tried to divorce her but was okay with him fucking other women as long as he was discreet.", "NTA because, frankly it was his wish, and your mother wasn't deserving of a pleasant lie that preserves her reputation.", "His younger sister was born. His mum stopped wanting to have sex so his dad started having affairs.", "She wouldn't let him leave either. You missed that part, apparently. Sounds like he tried to leave many times, and she makes some pretty vile threats to him if he did leave. Also spind slime from the pist that OP's didn't care that he fucked other women as long as she got her money and had her perfect family facade. Reading comprehension is important. This is why Dad gets a pass.", "In principle I agree with you that the decent thing to do is leave. OP specifically says she threatened his dad with awful things to stop him from doing that. Given that her response to him doing this was to say she would ruin his relationships with his siblings, there's a pattern of controlling and manipulative behaviour here that suggests at minimum emotional and psychological abuse. Abusers aren't entitled to the silence of their victims or the protection of their reputations. \n\nOP you're NTA and if I were in your dad's shoes I would be phenomenally proud. It takes a lot of courage to do what you did, to face the fallout afterwards with your head held high. As an abuse survivor, you have my applause and support.", "And what I stayed is not only explicitly implied and stated in the OP, but also elaborated on in the comments. From OP in the comments: \nI think my mom was a shitty wife because she threatened to go to the cops and accuse him of abuse if he tried to divorce her but was okay with him fucking other women as long as he was discreet.", "> Is his mother a good parent?\n\nConsidering she thinks she controls 17 year olds and can ruin their relationships with siblings, I'd say not.", "From where? OP says otherwise but you know better right?", "It's literally in the text. His younger sister was born. His mum stopped wanting to have sex so his dad started having affairs.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother\u2019s threat is an empty one, but boy is it revealing. I\u2019d take a long break from her while you grieve however you need to.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss. I hope you and your sisters find comfort in each other\u2019s memories.", "NTA as you said, it was his dying wish.", "NTA. Sounds like OPs dad made the most of a bad situation.

It seems you have been placed in the middle of your parents. Not ok in my book. Relationships are challenging and it does take two people. It is impossible for children to fully understand their parents history.\n\nIt sounds like what you know of their relationship is largely influenced by your dad. Having you read this sounds petty as hell honestly. You air the dirty laundry in a way where he doesn\u2019t have to deal with any fallout and she can\u2019t defend herself.\n\nMaybe they were both shitty spouses. Maybe your dad wasn\u2019t as much a victim as he led you to believe. Maybe your mom is terrible. The only thing I would say is make sure the opinion you have of your mother is your opinion.

Way to trivialise withholding physical affection for literal decades!\nHis youngest daughter goes off to college in 2 months. That\u2019s 18 years without sex. That is objectively unacceptable.

The dad clearly stayed on in order to protect his kids.", "Yeah that is shitty and I am less sympathetic to OP's mom in that light. However, it doesn't change the fact that it is an asshole move to be airing dirty laundry to everyone at the funeral, even if it's his dad's wish. Sure, it hits reddit's revenge fantasy, but imagine not being a part of the family and hearing that being read out? You'd cringe because no one looks good in that scenario, it's not a thing to be proud of to have such an utterly dysfunctional home life.", "She threatened to accuse him of abuse and keep the kids away from him if he left. So yeah, that's a bit threatening", "Then why force him to stay in the marriage? Seems like the mother didn't care about any of them as long as she had what she wanted.", "So they should just keep everything quiet so that people don't think badly about the parents?", "I didnt mean what did she threaten him with, I mean there's a discrepancy between the way she forces him to stay but apparently cannot do anything at all about affairs, and general lack of interest. Again, nothings impossible but abusive and controlling partners do not usually force their partner to stay but expect nothing else. And they typically get more and more controlling over time. Its just a bit random, and it makes me wonder if OPs take on this relationship is possibly inaccurate.", "They fought about it a lot first, according to the OP. Then the cheating started.", "So she went down that route before he had affairs", "Looks like she threatened ol\" \"I'll take your kids and you'll never see them again, I'll tell the judge you violated and abused me\" etc etc. So, she's given every opportunity to marry wherever. I Can't blame her for finding an outlet for sexual or romantic affection elsewhere since there's probably nothing in return.", "You talk about it like it's a conscious choice. PND is not and can lead to a lot of other issues. The one element missing from the story is what the Mother wanted. OP doesn't seem to know or care and the Dad certainly didn't. Mental and physical health isn't straight forward and the living parent still has to exist in the world. She will now do this with extra suffering, unnecessarily.", "People like to keep up images. She didn't want to be divorced because it could reflect badly on her, but she didn't care if he was cheating as long as it was discreet as Op said. I don't know why you are debating whether OP was wrong about the dynamic of his own family", "Sorry, are you saying that she should have just given him sex and the affairs are her fault because she didn't want to? The 1950s would like their attitudes back", "I haven't seen that stated anywhere.", "Kinda how the father had to suffer, unnecessarily, because she \u201cthreatened some really shitty things to force him to stay married to her\u201d? Even the kids side with their dad and sing his praises. \n\nWhat else can the wife get away with before you decide she deserves to be called out for her actions? The entitlement and misandry is evident in your biased takeaways.", ">I don't know why you are debating whether OP was wrong about the dynamic of his own family\n\nBecause someone else brought it up, and I said I'm not gonna vote on something like this when the dynamics are potentially obscured by OPs version of events. Not sure why YOU have come to me to debate it. I'm not trying to stop other people doing so. \n\nAnd like, no amount of explaining her perspective is gonna make me take it back, I did read the comments (well some of them) previously, I'm saying that it feels too easily swayed and some of the details are statistically unlikely.", "I\u2019m saying if you want a relationship with someone intimacy is a huge part in a relationship and while you\u2019re not obligated to engage in sex you have to acknowledge that a person is not obligated to remain in a sexless relationship.\n\nOkay she didn\u2019t want sex with him, but instead of allowing him the freedom to move on and find another partner she chose to instead force him to remain married through threats.", "You can base your opinion on context clues but the rest of us can\u2019t?", "What\u2019s statistically unlikely? That a mom claims a dad will never see his kids again if he leaves? That a mom threatened false accusations of abuse? That a dad is a victim? That a victim will cheat but stays?", "I love how you're ignoring the fact that OP himself described his dad as a shitty husband. Clearly he saw major faults on both sides but you're choosing to ignore that, why? The issue isn't \"who was the worst spouse?\" but that's what you seem to want to make it.\n\nI'm just agreeing with OPs judgement on his own family's dynamics, not sure why you think you know better than him"]}
