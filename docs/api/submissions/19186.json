He got one over your mum from the grave.", ">He was however a shitty husband.\n\nI mean...was he though? Your mother sounds like a controlling asshole who exploits people's fears of familial breakdown to extort them. It sounds like she threatened the ol' \"I'll take your kids and you'll never see them again, I'll tell the judge you violated me and are abusive,\" etc etc. So, at the point where she's being given all of the perks of being married to him while likely giving nothing in return I can't really blame him for finding outlets for sexual or romantic affection elsewhere. It's shitty, but shitty in a not too dissimilar fashion from an abuse victim who cheats as an escape. That might be a tad overly hyperbolic, but I stand by the comparison.\n\nAlso it created such beautiful posthumous dirt to completely humiliate your mother indirectly, so...\n\nNTA because, frankly it was his wish, and your mother wasn't deserving of a pleasant lie that preserves her reputation. The fact that she immediately went for, \"you'll never see your sisters again,\" kinda just vindicates me. She sounds like she'll be a very lonely old woman at Shady Acres Retirement in a decade or two.", "heck no you are 100% NTA. Glad your dad got to have his truth read out in the open!!!

We too should be able to enjoy his late fathers last wishes :)", "Sounds like he was having affairs before she went down that route though & that's what set her off.\n\nShe sounds pretty terrible but it does sound originally he started having affairs because his wife no longer wanted sex."]}
