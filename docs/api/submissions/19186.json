Your mother sounds like a controlling asshole who exploits people's fears of familial breakdown to extort them. It sounds like she threatened the ol' \"I'll take your kids and you'll never see them again, I'll tell the judge you violated me and are abusive,\" etc etc. So, at the point where she's being given all of the perks of being married to him while likely giving nothing in return I can't really blame him for finding outlets for sexual or romantic affection elsewhere. It's shitty, but shitty in a not too dissimilar fashion from an abuse victim who cheats as an escape. That might be a tad overly hyperbolic, but I stand by the comparison.\n\nAlso it created such beautiful posthumous dirt to completely humiliate your mother indirectly, so...\n\nNTA because, frankly it was his wish, and your mother wasn't deserving of a pleasant lie that preserves her reputation.

It's not like you wrote it. You just carried out your dying father's final wish.", "So you think your mom was a shitty wife because she didn't want to have sex? Do you even know why? Was it because your dad was already cheating? Did she have post partum depression? Early menopause? Other health issues? \n\nIt seems like you think your mom is a bad person for not having sex with your dad but you don't give any reason for it or why this makes her a shitty mom. \n\nBecause that's the only reason why you would read the eulogy: to get back at her. And I think that's what your dad wanted too. \n\nMaybe it was deserved but unless you give more info: yta", "Yta I think you are too immature to understand life and relationships and the relationship your parents had and you likely never will be able to grow bc of your genetics. There are so many scenarios you don\u2019t consider Imagine choosing someone over other people and buidling a life with someone putting your life on hold and all of the things you could have done and putting your body through the stress of having and creating 3 lives and then your partner cheats on you. Over and over again. Disrespects you, causes you to have STDs spends the money you both have a right to on other women, would you be dying to have sex with them again? Or would you say you do your thing and I\u2019ll raise our kids like you promised me we would do. You would blame her for doing so?

So imo you\u2019re Garbage.", "NTA.  I hope had your dad not gotten sick he would have left now that your youngest sibling is 18, but in any case, at least he \"freed\" himself in death.  I hope you and your siblings can remember him for the good things he did and tried and find some peace and healthy relationships in your future.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f he sounds like someone who tried to make the best of bad situations", "NTA... there is a guy who made a business out of doing exactly this. Good on you for honoring your Dad who was a great Dad to you. The equivalent of the old joke about bury me upside down so everyone can kiss my ass.", "NTA.

We don't necessarily know the full story here so if the eulogy said shit like \"My wife wouldn't fuck me for no reason so I fucked loads of other women\" when she may have initially had a legitimate reason (e.g. a traumatic child birth that made it physically painful to have sex. Again, just an example not saying this actually happened), of course she and her parents would be unhappy.\n\nAnyway, even if it were the case that OP's mom denied his dad sex for no reason, the decent thing to do is leave, not cheat on her with multiple women. That's a horrible way to treat the person you made the decision to commit to for the rest of your life. It's on his mom that she was seemingly so obsessed about making him stay though.\n\nCompletely rubs me the wrong way that people are essentially giving OP's dad a pass because OP's mom wouldn't let him get some and was controlling so she *totally* deserved the decades of cheating and having her private issues publicly aired to everyone who knows her.", "Yes, the relationship between his parents was between them. Is his mother a good parent?

You missed that part, apparently. Sounds like he tried to leave many times, and she makes some pretty vile threats to him if he did leave. Also from the post that OP's mom didn't care that he fucked other women as long as she got her money and had her perfect family facade. Reading comprehension is important. This is why Dad gets a pass.", "In principle I agree with you that the decent thing to do is leave. OP specifically says she threatened his dad with awful things to stop him from doing that. Given that her response to him doing this was to say she would ruin his relationships with his siblings, there's a pattern of controlling and manipulative behaviour here that suggests at minimum emotional and psychological abuse. Abusers aren't entitled to the silence of their victims or the protection of their reputations. \n\nOP you're NTA and if I were in your dad's shoes I would be phenomenally proud. It takes a lot of courage to do what you did, to face the fallout afterwards with your head held high. As an abuse survivor, you have my applause and support.", "And what I stayed is not only explicitly implied and stated in the OP, but also elaborated on in the comments.

It is impossible for children to fully understand their parents history.\n\nIt sounds like what you know of their relationship is largely influenced by your dad. Having you read this sounds petty as hell honestly. You air the dirty laundry in a way where he doesn\u2019t have to deal with any fallout and she can\u2019t defend herself.\n\nMaybe they were both shitty spouses.

You'd cringe because no one looks good in that scenario, it's not a thing to be proud of to have such an utterly dysfunctional home life.", "She threatened to accuse him of abuse and keep the kids away from him if he left. So yeah, that's a bit threatening", "Then why force him to stay in the marriage? Seems like the mother didn't care about any of them as long as she had what she wanted.", "So they should just keep everything quiet so that people don't think badly about the parents?", "I didnt mean what did she threaten him with, I mean there's a discrepancy between the way she forces him to stay but apparently cannot do anything at all about affairs, and general lack of interest. Again, nothings impossible but abusive and controlling partners do not usually force their partner to stay but expect nothing else. And they typically get more and more controlling over time. Its just a bit random, and it makes me wonder if OPs take on this relationship is possibly inaccurate.", "They fought about it a lot first, according to the OP. Then the cheating started.", "So she went down that route before he had affairs", "Looks like she threatened ol\" \"I'll take your kids and you'll never see them again, I'll tell the judge you violated and abused me\" etc etc. So, she's given every opportunity to marry wherever. I Can't blame her for finding an outlet for sexual or romantic affection elsewhere since there's probably nothing in return.", "You talk about it like it's a conscious choice. PND is not and can lead to a lot of other issues. The one element missing from the story is what the Mother wanted. OP doesn't seem to know or care and the Dad certainly didn't.

While that sucks for the other adults to hear (although some might have found it funny) most probably knew or guessed a lot of it. Your Mom sucks for obvious reasons and I do think there might have been a better way to air this out although I understand him wanting to do so.

I would have done it myself.", "You didn't get the part where the mother threatened the father to stay married, did you?

Why do people have this bizarre mystical attitude about sex but not the other components of a normal, healthy, loving relationship? Imagine saying \"he doesn't owe you emotional support\" or \"it's his choice whether he wants to be kind to you or not\". Nobody should be coerced into anything in a relationship, but if physical or emotional intimacy is something you're not willing to give, maybe a good idea to rethink the relationship.
