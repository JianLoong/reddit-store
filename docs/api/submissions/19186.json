Your mother sounds like a controlling asshole who exploits people's fears of familial breakdown to extort them. It sounds like she threatened the ol' \"I'll take your kids and you'll never see them again, I'll tell the judge you violated me and are abusive,\" etc etc. So, at the point where she's being given all of the perks of being married to him while likely giving nothing in return I can't really blame him for finding outlets for sexual or romantic affection elsewhere. It's shitty, but shitty in a not too dissimilar fashion from an abuse victim who cheats as an escape. That might be a tad overly hyperbolic, but I stand by the comparison.\n\nAlso it created such beautiful posthumous dirt to completely humiliate your mother indirectly, so...\n\nNTA because, frankly it was his wish, and your mother wasn't deserving of a pleasant lie that preserves her reputation.

It's not like you wrote it. You just carried out your dying father's final wish.", "So you think your mom was a shitty wife because she didn't want to have sex? Do you even know why? Was it because your dad was already cheating? Did she have post partum depression? Early menopause? Other health issues? \n\nIt seems like you think your mom is a bad person for not having sex with your dad but you don't give any reason for it or why this makes her a shitty mom. \n\nBecause that's the only reason why you would read the eulogy: to get back at her. And I think that's what your dad wanted too. \n\nMaybe it was deserved but unless you give more info: yta", "Yta I think you are too immature to understand life and relationships and the relationship your parents had and you likely never will be able to grow bc of your genetics. There are so many scenarios you don\u2019t consider Imagine choosing someone over other people and buidling a life with someone putting your life on hold and all of the things you could have done and putting your body through the stress of having and creating 3 lives and then your partner cheats on you. Over and over again. Disrespects you, causes you to have STDs spends the money you both have a right to on other women, would you be dying to have sex with them again? Or would you say you do your thing and I\u2019ll raise our kids like you promised me we would do. You would blame her for doing so? And then after he dies your son that you created that you pushed out screaming says nasty things about you in the funeral of a man he couldn\u2019t even begin to know the way you do. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what happened but your dad was an adult and if he was unhappy with the arrangement he could have left to be with one of those other women but likely he enjoyed having a maid and childcare and a caretaker when he is sick and all the million things women do for men. So imo you\u2019re Garbage.", "NTA.  I hope had your dad not gotten sick he would have left now that your youngest sibling is 18, but in any case, at least he \"freed\" himself in death.  I hope you and your siblings can remember him for the good things he did and tried and find some peace and healthy relationships in your future.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f he sounds like someone who tried to make the best of bad situations", "NTA... there is a guy who made a business out of doing exactly this.

We don't necessarily know the full story here so if the eulogy said shit like \"My wife wouldn't fuck me for no reason so I fucked loads of other women\" when she may have initially had a legitimate reason (e.g. a traumatic child birth that made it physically painful to have sex. Again, just an example not saying this actually happened), of course she and her parents would be unhappy.\n\nAnyway, even if it were the case that OP's mom denied his dad sex for no reason, the decent thing to do is leave, not cheat on her with multiple women. That's a horrible way to treat the person you made the decision to commit to for the rest of your life. It's on his mom that she was seemingly so obsessed about making him stay though.\n\nCompletely rubs me the wrong way that people are essentially giving OP's dad a pass because OP's mom wouldn't let him get some and was controlling so she *totally* deserved the decades of cheating and having her private issues publicly aired to everyone who knows her.", "Yes, the relationship between his parents was between them. Is his mother a good parent? If so, I hope it was worth humiliating her and risk being cut off from her.", "I think my mom was a shitty wife because she threatened to go to the cops and accuse him of abuse if he tried to divorce her but was okay with him fucking other women as long as he was discreet.", "NTA because, frankly it was his wish, and your mother wasn't deserving of a pleasant lie that preserves her reputation.", "[removed]", "She wouldn't let him leave either. You missed that part, apparently. Sounds like he tried to leave many times, and she makes some pretty vile threats to him if he did leave. Also from the post that OP's mom didn't care that he fucked other women as long as she got her money and had her perfect family facade. Reading comprehension is important. This is why Dad gets a pass.", "In principle I agree with you that the decent thing to do is leave. OP specifically says she threatened his dad with awful things to stop him from doing that. Given that her response to him doing this was to say she would ruin his relationships with his siblings, there's a pattern of controlling and manipulative behaviour here that suggests at minimum emotional and psychological abuse. Abusers aren't entitled to the silence of their victims or the protection of their reputations. \n\nOP you're NTA and if I were in your dad's shoes I would be phenomenally proud. It takes a lot of courage to do what you did, to face the fallout afterwards with your head held high. As an abuse survivor, you have my applause and support.", "And what I stayed is not only explicitly implied and stated in the OP, but also elaborated on in the comments.

OP says otherwise but you know better right?", "It's literally in the text. His younger sister was born. His mum stopped wanting to have sex so his dad started having affairs.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother\u2019s threat is an empty one, but boy is it revealing.

It seems you have been placed in the middle of your parents. Not ok in my book. Relationships are challenging and it does take two people. It is impossible for children to fully understand their parents history.\n\nIt sounds like what you know of their relationship is largely influenced by your dad. Having you read this sounds petty as hell honestly. You air the dirty laundry in a way where he doesn\u2019t have to deal with any fallout and she can\u2019t defend herself.\n\nMaybe they were both shitty spouses. Maybe your dad wasn\u2019t as much a victim as he led you to believe. Maybe your mom is terrible. The only thing I would say is make sure the opinion you have of your mother is your opinion.

However, it doesn't change the fact that it is an asshole move to be airing dirty laundry to everyone at the funeral, even if it's his dad's wish.

Again, nothings impossible but abusive and controlling partners do not usually force their partner to stay but expect nothing else. And they typically get more and more controlling over time. Its just a bit random, and it makes me wonder if OPs take on this relationship is possibly inaccurate.", "They fought about it a lot first, according to the OP. Then the cheating started.", "So she went down that route before he had affairs", "Looks like she threatened ol\" \"I'll take your kids and you'll never see them again, I'll tell the judge you violated and abused me\" etc etc. So, she's given every opportunity to marry wherever.

Whatever caused it was already existing massive issue between the two of them.", "Don't care, he should have left her for the good of everyone in the situation. It's not just about the cheating.", "They said he'd known he was dying for months. So it's not like this was something sprung on him posthumously.\n\nThey would have talked about this and the son had his chance to refuse. He chose not to. He could have backed out at any time. He chose not to.", "NTA. You honored one of you dad's last wishes. My condolences on your loss.  \n\n\nMy father wrote his own eulogy as well during his hospice, and made us promise to use it. It was weird & funny, and we ended up adding it to a little bulletin we had made up and gave him credit for his part. One of the funny things (that we didn't even know was funny until the funeral) was he claimed he graduated high school 2nd in his class (sounds impressive, and something I never knew).   \nDuring the service, everybody who wanted to was given a chance to talk. Well, one of his high school classmates, but 1 year behind him, told us that while it was true that he graduated 2nd in his class, his school was so small, that only 2 students graduated that year. So 2nd also meant last.  \nEven after death, my father (the king of dad jokes) got one last smart ass remark in.", "NTA\n\nBut I also have an unpopular opinion: I am so not gonna be one of those \u201cyou better do my dying request at my funeral\u201d people because honestly, the funeral isn\u2019t for me, I\u2019m not gonna be there, so I dont really give a shit what you do lol. I have two requests that I\u2019ve already told my mother: put my cause of death in my obituary and I want to be buried, not cremated. I have life insurance specifically so I know the burial can be afforded. Other than that, do what you do!", "NTA. While not everything needs to be said publicly, the basic rule is \"don't do shit if you don't want people to know about it.\" You simply honored your dad's wishes. HE is the one who wrote the eulogy. Sorry for your loss.", "Absolutely not. It was the last request from your dad and you did exactly what he wanted. Good job. Your mom on the other hand, sounds like an exhausting AH. But you are NTA.", "Not going to judge, just sorry for your loss.", "NTA, gotta love the people that skipped over the wife abusing her husband and using the kids and police to prevent him from divorcing her", "NTA. Based on this story, the wrong person died.", "Your dad is the AH.  He only did that to hurt your mother.  You think you know everything about their marriage but you do not.", "Dude, you know the answer.\n\nNTA", "Nta.", "I want to read the eulogy", "My eyes aren't sweating, yours are. Your dad sounds amazing. He really really cared about you and your siblings and was able to find a way to keep himself sane at the same time.", "Yes because the \u201cmom\u201d is a total saint.", "I agree", "Lol. Is this \"Is Everyone Around Me the Saint\" or AITA?", ">I'm still not 100 percent sure why she told me.\n\nI can't speak for her, but if had to disappear from my family I would want *someone* to know where I was.", "Lol we're talking less than 20 years ago, \"in those days\" fathers who want custody will get custody.", "It kind of sounds like the post was the actual eulogy. Starting @ 2nd paragraph. Last line being \u201csince it was his dying request I agreed to do it.\u201d Like OP\u2019s dad is explaining why the son was saying all this. \n\n\nWith OP\u2019s own words starting 4th paragraph from the bottom at: \u201cIt was funny\u2026\n\n\nOr OP is just a heck of a writer. But man that would be good.", "All he did was spread the truth. If it hurts, then it's on the people who were hurt by it.", "A lot of us believe if it\u2019s funny or true( bonus points if funny and true) it\u2019s fair game. Also some of us are as old as dirt and no longer easily offended.", "Clearly you\u2019re a woman to be siding with OPs mom. All a woman has to do is run to the police crying abuse and the father is in cuffs. But no, OPs dad was a coward", "Disagree with both of you. I'd say it's not cheating because the marriage is dead, and she is the one forcing the formality alive instead of a clean divorce.\n\nWhen both parties are essentially checked out but remained a couple on paper, there's nothing left in the relationship to cheat on.", "And mom was a giant asshole", "NTA and I know everyone is saying that cheaters have no excuse for their actions but\u2026 When one spouse is seeking physical affection and the other spouse is constantly rebuking it that is a form of incompatibility. The fact that your mom forced him to stay married to her as the only way for him to see his children was disgusting. Anyone who is thinking we\u2019re not getting a full or honest story should look no further than the mother trying to then control the relationship between the siblings after the funeral. A good parent doesn\u2019t do that, but a controlling appearance obsessed one would. She\u2019s not a good person. I also really wish that couples would discuss their sexual needs honestly before committing to having children so they\u2019re not stuck in this kind of situation.", "Bingo!", "I read about this guy recently, he did it once for a friend I believe and now he has a business travelling the world dishing out eulogies like this!", "I remember a post, I can't really tell if it was here or a relationship sub, about a man who was uncomfortable with the way a woman was acting towards him. Reading what he described, it was obvious she was trying to flirt with him, but the OP was oblivious to it.\n\nThe comments were appalling! Instead of focusing on the part where his acquaintance made him feel uncomfortable, they were all bashing him because he didn't realise that woman liked him and was flirting with him! Instead of feeling uncomfortable, he should have been flattered that the woman liked him! \n\nOf course, anyone who pointed out that regardless of her intentions, she was making him uncomfortable and that if the roles were reversed they would be (rightfully) telling the girl to get away, were downvoted to hell.", "There are many circumstances in life where the balance of power makes it impossible to be sure you've obtained actual, and not coerced, consent. Refusing your dying parent's funeral wishes? Hardly an easy no. Personally if I had the time dad did and wanted to be petty I'd record it myself and leave instructions for it to be played at the funeral. It's a selfish act to weaponize your child to have the last word in a lifelong feud.", "I agree with that there's no information that she baby trapped him, but\n\n>My mom is calling me an asshole and says that she is going to do her best to make sure I never see my sisters\n\nThat sounds like she's using the children as weapons even now, but against each other.\n\nNTA, OP.", "I know right. Based as fuck", "Your dad should have paid a [coffin confessor](https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/careers/the-coffin-confessor-queensland-man-paid-to-speak-for-the-dead/news-story/d518372ec6c329909270380a5fff93a9?amp) to do that for him instead of putting you in the firing line like that. You\u2019re going to have to live with the consequences of that eulogy forever. I\u2019m glad he got to say what he needed to say, but it was selfish of him to ask you to be the one brandishing his stick.", "> at poetic justice\n\nFirst of all I agree that she should have read the eulogy, but was the mothers only crime just refusing sex? \n\nI mean they both lived in a sham marriage and both kept a secret. He wrote that eulogy with a lot of resentment, with the intention of having her publicly shamed.\n\nEven legal courts respect secrecy between spouses, I can somewhat understand the mother. I don't think being in a miserable marriage was a one sided affair.", "> This exactly. She had the control for YEARS and he endured it\n\nHe endured nothing, he was still banging on the side, and presumably the mother was still involved in raising and caring for the kids. \n\nDoes the mother not have the right to refuse sex? \n\nThey basically lived separate lives and both agreed to it.  \n\nWe have no idea if the eulogy was basically a rant from a dying man, about how he couldn't get laid by his wife, and how many women he slept with on the side. \n\nThe only positive aspect I am hearing about this man is that he gave money to his family, but was otherwise living as a single man.", ">both agreed to it\n\nMissed the section where op states that his mom threatened his dad with \"really shitty things\" to not divorce? Or did you just ignored it to craft your headcanon?", "Was it not clear he clearly wanted to leave her and she threatened him with things the op couldn\u2019t mention? Definitely says that in the posts. So to say he endured nothing is\u2026 interesting when it seems he was trapped and unhappy with her"]}
