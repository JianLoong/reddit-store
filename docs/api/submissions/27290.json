Unfortunately our mother passed away when we were young, so our father was left all alone to take care of us and I admit it must have been difficult to do so, I mean, we were teenagers at that time. Our father was an immigrant from Italy and saw the horrors of war firsthand but was always a good father and also a decent man.\n\nHe married his second wife, the stepmother, and they stayed together until his death. Bear in mind the stepmother was the same age as us and so the relationship between was always strained. Stepmother got pregnant and at that time concerns were raised because of their advanced age. Unfortunately our father passed away fifteen years ago, my sisters and I were in our fifties, half-sister was only 12. She's now 27.\n\nI should mention that half-sister was absolutely the apple of our father's eye.\n\nWhen he passed, I made it very clear that I didn't want anything to do with the stepmother and half-sister anymore, that all the ties were gone and so we were no contact for a couple years even though we lived in the same street. Stepmother took my half-sister out of school after his death, purposely ruining her daughter's life. I know that my half-sister did not have the normal experience of growing up, she also lost her friends, she missed out on the experiences and I always knew it would come to this because stepmother is a terrible person.\n\nI recognize that I did have the privilege of keeping a normal life after a parent's death and while it is a shame that half-sister hasn't had the same chance, I choose not to intervene.\n\nFast forward a couple years, found out my half-sister got severe depression, hasn't finished her studies and is pratically a doormat. Our father left each daughter a share in his estate, but half-sister was very irresponsible with hers. She tried to reach out to my sisters and I, saying her psychiatrist told her she \"needed a support group,\" and said she's alone and can't count on anyone else.\n\nShe's going through a difficult time and wants to cut ties with her mother/our stepmother. She says she desperately needs someone. We tried to explained to her that a lot of time has passed, there's no bridge between us and our father's already dead. As in, there's no bond anymore.\n\nI got a call a couple days ago from the psychiatrist (apparently she gave my number to him in case of a emergency), who's very worried about her. To put it bluntly, I told him to forget my number, to never contact me again and made it clear that I don't want anything to do with the stepmother and half-sister. I also told him I will never forgive my half-sister for what she did to our father, destroying his legacy.

Just really hope this message reaches you. I say this with genuine care. As someone who also went through her 20s depressed and alone, the fact that you're saying she has \"destroyed your father's legacy\" because she is sad and lonely is one of the most depressing things I have ever heard. If you truly believe your father would be disappointed that his daughter -- who you admit has had nobody but a horrible abusive mother to guide her for the last 15 years -- hasn't \"pulled herself up by her bootstraps\" yet or something... then frankly your father does not sound as great as you seem to think he was. You can't pull up your bootstraps when nobody taught you how to put on boots in the first place. She is barefoot. And walking on broken glass.\n\nThis girl did not ask to be born, and I understand you all did not ask to be her sisters. And technically, you're entitled to decide who is in your life. But the amount of hate and vitriol you are dumping on this poor girl, when literally none of this is her fault... it makes me incredibly sad for her. You say you're never going to forgive her, but what has she actually done to you? Existed? This is just all around so hateful and sad. She reached out to you all, already knowing you didn't like her, and begged for your help anyways. She must be in an incredibly low and lonely place in her life to be brave enough to do that. And to only be met with such hatred in return... it makes my stomach churn.\n\nI sincerely hope you and your other sisters can realize how misdirected your anger is, and I hope this girl finds someone to be in her corner, even if it isn't you. Because it sounds like she could really use just a single friend. And she's only been met with hate. You and your other sisters have always had each other. She has no one. And instead of putting the blame rightfully on your father, who actually made all of these choices, you have decided to idolize his memory and put all of the blame on this girl because it's easier. My heart absolutely breaks for her.", "Info- you left this part out, unless it didn't happen in the first place, but how did you half sister destroy his legacy?", "YTA \n\nWhat \u201clegacy \u201c? \n\nThis girl has suffered pretty much her whole life and didn\u2019t ask to be born. Yet.. you blame her for being born anyway. You\u2019re probably right though to not be supportive of her because you\u2019re not what she needs. Not at all. Strangers on the street would probably be kinder.", "Info: What do you mean by the step-sister destroyed his legacy? Why did you cut ties when your father died? Why don't you have empathy for your half sister? What did she do to you? She was a helpless 12 year old when you cut ties with her. Why did you let your step mom destroy this child's life as you say? The story is missing key facts.", "OP, how can you be so heartless? What did your half-sister ever do to deserve such resentment from you and your sisters? She was a child when your father died and you were all, \"Yup, dad is gone so SEE YA!\" to your half-sister. WHY?! WHAT DID SHE DO?! \n\nYou're right, there is no bridge between you two BECAUSE YOU TORCHED IT FOR NO REASON! She's desperately trying to reach out to you because of the years and years of abuse from your stepmother that YOU ABANDONED HER WITH!\n\nOP, you are heartless. You are absolutely without a doubt an asshole\n\nYTA", "YTA. You sound so cold. You\u2019re bitter your dad remarried and had another child. You took out it on that child. It\u2019s not her fault she was born. If your stepmother was awful, by all means cut ties with her but the kid was innocent. The very least you could have done was made a phone call to social services if she was being neglected/abused. \n Also, what legacy? Your whole post is about your wicked stepmother and hating your half sister by extension. Then you drop the \u201cshe ruined our dad\u2019s legacy\u201d line in at the end with no explanation.\n\nETA: the found your answer to the legacy question. Your father would be disappointed in her? For suffering from depression after years of abuse? Yikes. Sounds like he\u2019d be more disappointed in you with your cold heart.", "YTA. WTF do you mean by \u201cdestroyed his legacy?\u201d\n\nIt sounds like her life was fucked as a child, and you just shit on her.\n\nEdit typo", "\"I will never forgive my half-sister for what she did to our father, destroying his legacy.\" YTA your father would be disappointed in you and your cruel mindset.", "Wow, YTA big time. Your half-sister was just a child when your father passed, and you turned your back on her because of your issues with your stepmother. She clearly had a troubled upbringing after his death, and now that she's reaching out for support, you're still refusing to help? Your resentment is misplaced. She was 12 when he passed; she wasn't responsible for whatever happened with your stepmother or the legacy you're so hung up on. Your father's real legacy would've been love and unity, but you've chosen bitterness and anger instead. It doesn't matter how much time has passed; family is family. Shame on you.", "Let me get this straight. An adult - because you were one when your dad died, punishes a 12 yo because you're mad at her mom? You left her in an abusive situation, then claimed she ruined her dad's legacy? You doubly abused her by not stepping up and be a decent human being! Not only are you an AH, you are a coward!\n \nShe is a doormat because I am sure her mother railroaded her through your dad's money - when you and your sisters could have stepped in, and been an executive of his estate. She also probably not once in her life had anyone who really believed in her. No wonder she's depressed. I'd be depressed if I had your family. You all sound like a lot of self centered narssastic jerks. \n\nHopefully, your sister realizes that she can choose her relatives too. And that she moves on and creates a better life for herself. My prayer that despite a long extensive ABBUSIVE situation by both her mother AND her sisters, that she is able to pull herself out of it and put you all to everlasting shame. \n\nGet over yourself. If anyone is privileged, it's you.", "YTA. She is depressed and in danger.\nYou could help but you won\u2019t.\nI\u2019m quite sure if she ends her life (which is a very serious possibility), you wouldn\u2019t care at all. You are clearly heartless. To be honest, taking out your resentment for your step mother on your sister makes you a bully.\n\nNo one is asking you to completely change you life but spending a few hours here and there to listen to her or to talk to her isn\u2019t that much.\n\nYou are talking about your father\u2019s legacy: YOU are destroying it by letting his daughter, your half sister, in this situation.\n \nI don\u2019t get along with my sister at all (for good reason linked to HER attitude, not anything a third party could have done), but if she reached out to me, I would help her.\n\nMy SO is NC with his sister and would probably let her die but she is a narcissistic pervert who tries to manipulate everyone and is persecuting her daughter. We still tried to help the little girl to make sure she could spend as much time as possible with her father.\n\nYour father would be so disappointed in you, and your mother probably even more so.", "YTA - the 12 year old who was home-schooled and abused, at least emotionally, by her mother destroyed your father's legacy. You have as much influence on your father's legacy as she did and you left her, the daughter of your father, to be mistreated. She's as much part of your legacy as you and his money are and he failed her too leaving her in a position to be exploited by her ~~father~~ mother. And you are blaming a literal child for this? Why? Because it absolves you of all responsibility and guilt for hating a child for replacing you in your Dad's affections.\n\nYou have no duty to her, no responsibility but my, you are enjoying watching your replacement implode. And that makes you a AH to my mind. And dressing it up with high sentiments doesn't make it look any better.\n\nEdit: you could have helped your father's \"legacy\" (child and money alike) but you choose not to intervene. I hope you hold yourself to same standards as you did the child. Why are you allowed forgiveness and not her?", "YTA - she wants a non-abusive family member to talk to.  Talk to this child, she has been abused since she was 12, ffs.  I understand your resentment with your dad marrying someone your age, but this child is probably going to die without support, and she is down to someone who she knows resents her for emotional help.", "Wow. You don't have to have anyone you don't want in your life, but I just have to vote YTA because you were so damn mean to a literal child who was being abused. She was 12! 12 years old! And wtf is this legacy stuff about? Do you think you are a good representation of his legacy? You're horribly cruel. God forbid you ever need anyone one day, may the person you need only treat you how you've treated others.", "You are a heartless human. YTA", "It sounds like you are taking out your anger with your stepmother on your half-sister. How did she manage to \"destroy your father's legacy\"? Was it just by existing? Did she sell the family home to a developer who bulldozed it?\n\nWithout more of an explanation, it's hard to say that you're being appropriately angry with her.", "The only one destroying his legacy is you.

A huge part of Italian culture is family and looking out for one another, you're doing the exact opposite. What have you done that makes you worth more?

She has barely lived and yet you act as though she is the reason your life is terrible. You sound bitter and spiteful, this woman could die and you genuinely don't care. \n\nShe didn't the stability you had and you need to seriously check yourself because you have some serious issues regarding spite and pettiness. Her stepmother is not her and yet you seem unable to differentiate that completely and even though you were old enough to step in and help your sister you chose not to. Then you judge her for the poor parenting of her mother that you watched and did nothing to help and then blame this poor girl for doing poorly with the shit resources she had. You are a hypocrite.

It\u2019s not your stepsister\u2019s fault that her mother is a weirdo, she was 12 years old when your dad died\u2014again, something she didn\u2019t control.

Somehow I doubt it.", "YTA, what did your half sister do to you to piss you off so much? The poor girl was 12 the last time you saw her. She was more abused than you were by your step mother. Your father chose to marry a cruel person his daughter's age, you should have been mad at him for that, not your half sis who had no choice in anything.

Unfortunately our mother passed away when we were young, so our father was left all alone to take care of us and I admit it must have been difficult to do so, I mean, we were teenagers at that time. Our father was an immigrant from Italy and saw the horrors of war firsthand but was always a good father and also a decent man.\n\nHe married his second wife, the stepmother, and they stayed together until his death. Bear in mind the stepmother was the same age as us and so the relationship between was always strained. Stepmother got pregnant and at that time concerns were raised because of their advanced age. Unfortunately our father passed away fifteen years ago, my sisters and I were in our fifties, half-sister was only 12. She's now 27.\n\nI should mention that half-sister was absolutely the apple of our father's eye.\n\nWhen he passed, I made it very clear that I didn't want anything to do with the stepmother and half-sister anymore, that all the ties were gone and so we were no contact for a couple years even though we lived in the same street. Stepmother took my half-sister out of school after his death, purposely ruining her daughter's life. I know that my half-sister did not have the normal experience of growing up, she also lost her friends, she missed out on the experiences and I always knew it would come to this because stepmother is a terrible person.\n\nI recognize that I did have the privilege of keeping a normal life after a parent's death and while it is a shame that half-sister hasn't had the same chance, I choose not to intervene.\n\nFast forward a couple years, found out my half-sister got severe depression, hasn't finished her studies and is pratically a doormat. Our father left each daughter a share in his estate, but half-sister was very irresponsible with hers. She tried to reach out to my sisters and I, saying her psychiatrist told her she \"needed a support group,\" and said she's alone and can't count on anyone else.\n\nShe's going through a difficult time and wants to cut ties with her mother/our stepmother. She says she desperately needs someone. We tried to explained to her that a lot of time has passed, there's no bridge between us and our father's already dead. As in, there's no bond anymore.\n\nI got a call a couple days ago from the psychiatrist (apparently she gave my number to him in case of a emergency), who's very worried about her. To put it bluntly, I told him to forget my number, to never contact me again and made it clear that I don't want anything to do with the stepmother and half-sister. I also told him I will never forgive my half-sister for what she did to our father, destroying his legacy. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
