Your baby was inside distressed. Your job as mother was to take care of your baby which your SIL was not doing. You did nothing wrong. Your baby does not bond with someone over a few minutes and probably senses SIL is terrible.", "NTA. How does that even make sense coming out of her mouth? \u201cI never interact with your daughter or chose to bond with her because ONE TIME when she was 4months old she was crying really bad and you came over and soothed your own baby.

I'd never let her near my kids again, she's already played her hand.", "NTA. Not sure why this is a question!   \nSounds like SIL is determined to not connect with you/your child\u2026 who knows why, maybe she\u2019s desperately unhappy about something, maybe she doesn\u2019t like other people\u2019s kids, maybe something else.

The \u201cincident\u201d had no impact on anything, ever!  There are no conditions under which it would impact their relationship the next day, let alone now. \n\nSIL is delusional. \n\nNTA \n\nbtw, have you ever heard of adoption?

She's basically pulling anything out to make me seem like a bad person, but I can get really hyper focused on being right so I wanted to be sure where i really stand on this issue. I have apologized for things in the past, with other people, when it was pointed out to me why what I did was mean to them and how it hurt them, but this one being so long ago and involving my baby really has been hard for me to see her side of.", "Funny story, she's been in it a lot. She's gone on multiple 'retreats' and likes to post about how healed she is....", "I really dont know, especially since she ignored my entire pregnancy and the birth of my baby. She didnt send anything to me or her brother, no text or gift, which I wasnt banking on anyway. She love bombed me when I got with my husband and went on and on about how she was so happy to have a 'little' sister, I'm a year younger than her. All interactions kind of ended when she got with her husband, I just chalked it up to life getting busy and never really thought about it until my daughter arrived and she became distant.", "The thing is after I took care of my baby and the dogs got dinner I thought it was a great night. A cousin had come in from out of state, hence the last minute BBQ, and I had only ever met them once before. We spent the whole night chatting and getting to know each other. SIL did interrupt me a few times, I asked my husband if he thought she was doing it more than usual and he said no, that she was just excited to have her cousin in town and I let it go. That's why her claims now, months after the fact, are so weird to me.\n\nEdit to fix missing words.", "My in-laws live in a retired neighborhood. None of their neighbors set off fireworks. We said before we left our house that we'd be bringing our dogs, BIL was in the group message. BIL said he just bought the fireworks just before getting there, so he knew the dogs would be there before he got them. FIL has never let us set off fireworks before. The most that's ever been done was doing sparklers in the front yard with a hose on hand and a bucket of water to put the sticks in. Had I known that BIL was going to buy and set off fireworks before hand I wouldn't have gone and just spent the night at home with my dogs in the quietist part of my house, as I have done since we got the oldest 5 years ago. This was only the second time taking them from the house on the 4th, the first was to FILs as well and there were no fireworks that year, only sparklers which my dogs love. I had no reason to expect loud fireworks them to be there.", "She sounds like she\u2019s looking to deflect criticism your way. Time to go \u2019polite mode engaged\u2019 and just be politely distant. This is going to blow up, and you don\u2019t want to be in the fall out zone. And by this, I mean\u2026 her marriage might implode, and she\u2019s create a hostile family drama, and the further off the stage you are the better.", "You need to talk to your husband about lessen contact with his relatives, they don't sound like the healthiest bunch to have around.", "My aunt has SERIOUS mental illness yet all her counselors say we are the ill ones.  (There is some truth to that lol)  i never understood how her therapist could say that until I realized that my aunt is  so pathological that her therapist would not know the truth without a third party to contradict her.\n\nIt hurts.  Family shouldn't hurt our children.   They shouldn't hurt us,  but they do.  It's hard to accept that and walk away in peace within ourselves.", "Yeah staying home sounds like it would have been the better choice.", "hindsight is 20/20", "NTA and your SIL sounds like a drama queen.", "NTA. Your in-laws are all around AH\u2019s. Don\u2019t bring your child or your dogs around them.", "Info: I Sil ignores you and your baby,what started the argument? Seems you don't really talk so how did you end up fighting", "Oi. There have been a few times I couldn't soothe my neices (I have 6 and all of them neices \ud83e\udd23) and just got ahold of my sister/SIL/BIL  to let them know/help. I have my own kiddo and similar things have come up with sister/SIL/MIL/BIL. We also have always had a lab, and they all have dogs too. Had this been happening, my family would have come to me about kiddo, and I would have asked my husband to get the pupper to a safe place (or opposite, sometimes he would grab our kiddo and I would make sure pupper was safe). Both my sister and SIL have dogs too. We have all been together many 4th of July, and they handle things no different.", "Sometimes the only thing that will soothe a baby that age is nursing.", "This ^^^!!! I have no notes, nothing further to add, except NTA.", "*Yeah,, that one time when I, a stranger who doesn't even interact with you, your daughter's mother and the one who could tell me how she reacts to many things and what she likes, and who presumably had an idea that my husband brought fireworks which would incite chaos in your home of dogs and a small infant.   How dare you! /s\n\nAlso, just chilling with a screaming infant while the homeowners chase barking, panicking dogs, and your husband, a guest, pops fireworks doesn't exactly seem like prime bonding to me, but ymmv I guess?", "She won't even be that. I apparently I've caused her a great deal of stress and have done for the last 4 years to the point she told everyone but my husband and myself.", "She was for a while. She'd come to our town from heres, like 40 minutes away, and hang out with me like once a week. We did henna nights, dorked around at walmart and it felt great that she was my friend. Then it all stopped. She didn't respond to my messages, but I just figured she was busy and moved on. Husband warned me she could be like that, just ignore you for days then act like it never happened, most of the family has ADHD or is on the spectrum so I figured it was that and a combo of her meeting her husband. \n\nUntil it got worse to the point she'd leave whatever room I was in or flat out turn her whole body away from me if I tried to talk to her.", "Oh we have talked all day about it. Once she brought this up as the tipping point she sent him screen shots of our conversation, with a big gap in her messages to me, and tried to get him on her side. He was having none of it and told her what her treatment of me and our daughter has done to me the last few years, she had no response to that, only more deflection of how I started it first but then failed to give another example of how. First she said it was this instance and now it was an earlier one, but she won't tell him what. He's over it.", "NTA.\n\nYour BIL is a total AH for setting fireworks near your dogs, who clearly were freaking out and he didn't realise that meant he should stop.\n\nYou're a mother, so taking that baby away, if nobody is taking care of it and its crying, is alright, it's what you should do.\n\nDon't ever make yourself think you're the AH here. Your BIL and SIL are.", "Read some of OP\u2019s other comments, honestly it sounds like she doesn\u2019t really know what happened either. Definitely interesting hearing that hubby mentioned to OP his sister having a tendency to cold shoulder people out of the blue for generally unknown reasons", "I'm asking how we got from the cold shoulder to a fight. If someone ignores you then you can only fight if:\n\n1. They stop ignoring you and start a fight or\n\n2. You start a fight with them for ignoring you", "Ah sorry, I wasn\u2019t really thinking when I responded to you! Proof I\u2019m up way past my bedtime. Obviously we can\u2019t apply it to judgements on this post, but OP\u2019s post history gives wayyy more information on she and SIL\u2019s relationship"]}
