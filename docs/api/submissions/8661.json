Your baby was inside distressed. Your job as mother was to take care of your baby which your SIL was not doing. You did nothing wrong. Your baby does not bond with someone over a few minutes and probably senses SIL is terrible.", "NTA. How does that even make sense coming out of her mouth? \u201cI never interact with your daughter or chose to bond with her because ONE TIME when she was 4months old she was crying really bad and you came over and soothed your own baby. The audacity to mother your own child while I was holding her.\u201d \n\nLike wut.", "Nta, you're protecting and nurturing your child. I'd never let her near my kids again, she's already played her hand.", "NTA. Not sure why this is a question!   \nSounds like SIL is determined to not connect with you/your child\u2026 who knows why, maybe she\u2019s desperately unhappy about something, maybe she doesn\u2019t like other people\u2019s kids, maybe something else. Now you know you can\u2019t rely on her to watch your child.", "NTA\nYour BIL and SIL sound like a handful.", "Your SIL needs some therapy.

You are NTA", "NTA. tell her ur glad that she doesn\u2019t have a relationship with ur daughter cuz she\u2019s a psycho", "NTA.

The \u201cincident\u201d had no impact on anything, ever!  There are no conditions under which it would impact their relationship the next day, let alone now. \n\nSIL is delusional. \n\nNTA \n\nbtw, have you ever heard of adoption?   Children adopted at one week, one month, one year, five years, or ten years of age bond with their new parents.

She's basically pulling anything out to make me seem like a bad person, but I can get really hyper focused on being right so I wanted to be sure where i really stand on this issue. I have apologized for things in the past, with other people, when it was pointed out to me why what I did was mean to them and how it hurt them, but this one being so long ago and involving my baby really has been hard for me to see her side of.", "Funny story, she's been in it a lot. She's gone on multiple 'retreats' and likes to post about how healed she is....", "I really dont know, especially since she ignored my entire pregnancy and the birth of my baby. She didnt send anything to me or her brother, no text or gift, which I wasnt banking on anyway. She love bombed me when I got with my husband and went on and on about how she was so happy to have a 'little' sister, I'm a year younger than her. All interactions kind of ended when she got with her husband, I just chalked it up to life getting busy and never really thought about it until my daughter arrived and she became distant.", "The thing is after I took care of my baby and the dogs got dinner I thought it was a great night. A cousin had come in from out of state, hence the last minute BBQ, and I had only ever met them once before. We spent the whole night chatting and getting to know each other. SIL did interrupt me a few times, I asked my husband if he thought she was doing it more than usual and he said no, that she was just excited to have her cousin in town and I let it go. That's why her claims now, months after the fact, are so weird to me.\n\nEdit to fix missing words.", "My in-laws live in a retired neighborhood. None of their neighbors set off fireworks. We said before we left our house that we'd be bringing our dogs, BIL was in the group message. BIL said he just bought the fireworks just before getting there, so he knew the dogs would be there before he got them. FIL has never let us set off fireworks before. The most that's ever been done was doing sparklers in the front yard with a hose on hand and a bucket of water to put the sticks in. Had I known that BIL was going to buy and set off fireworks before hand I wouldn't have gone and just spent the night at home with my dogs in the quietist part of my house, as I have done since we got the oldest 5 years ago. This was only the second time taking them from the house on the 4th, the first was to FILs as well and there were no fireworks that year, only sparklers which my dogs love. I had no reason to expect loud fireworks them to be there.", "She sounds like she\u2019s looking to deflect criticism your way. Time to go \u2019polite mode engaged\u2019 and just be politely distant. This is going to blow up, and you don\u2019t want to be in the fall out zone. And by this, I mean\u2026 her marriage might implode, and she\u2019s create a hostile family drama, and the further off the stage you are the better.", "You need to talk to your husband about lessen contact with his relatives, they don't sound like the healthiest bunch to have around.", "My aunt has SERIOUS mental illness yet all her counselors say we are the ill ones.  (There is some truth to that lol)  i never understood how her therapist could say that until I realized that my aunt is  so pathological that her therapist would not know the truth without a third party to contradict her.\n\nIt hurts.  Family shouldn't hurt our children.   They shouldn't hurt us,  but they do.  It's hard to accept that and walk away in peace within ourselves.", "Yeah staying home sounds like it would have been the better choice.", "hindsight is 20/20"]}
