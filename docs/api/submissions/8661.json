I wasn't sitting waiting for a text at the time, it's been looking back at things that happened with her and trying to figure out what I did to upset her. \n\nThen I noticed a pattern of her never responding to anything I say in the family group text, about anything, she stopped responding to my personal messages, she never reacted to anything I posted about just my daughter on facebook but would if her brother was in the post; I went down a rabbit hole and realized it's been years since she said anything directly nice to me. \n\nI tried to expend an olive branch and figure out when I hurt or did something dumb so I could apologize or explain what I meant but that turned into her blowing up at me.", "In part of the large message she sent, that contradicts itself, she said that how I acted during her pregnancy made her want to keep her baby away from me, but I have no idea what that means and I know she'll never tell me. \n\nAt the time I was coming to terms with the fact that I may never have my own child, trouble conceiving for 4 years, but I always went out of my way to smile and tell my friends or family that I was happy at each announcement; then I'd go home and cry to myself or to my husband wondering when it would be our turn. I know she knew we were wanting a baby and it wasn't happening, but loses were. \n\nShe did get pregnant before marrying her husband and my only concern there was if he'd leave her; he has two other kids from two different women and I grew up around guys that just showed up to get you pregnant and then leave once the baby became \"too much\", but again I never said that to her and was friendly to him because I didn't know him.", "I was, but I knew better than to yell at him and just went back inside after everything was settled with my dogs.", "They are big on whole family get togethers; so like 30 people and FIL and MILs house about every three months or so.

The main issue being this one. But the thing that set me off about her claims of this being the worst thing I could have done to her was that she hadn't show any real interest in my daughter before I had her, when we arrived at the party or before I went out back with my dogs, but somehow this was such a hurtful experience it made her not want to have anything to do with me or my child. I couldn't understand it, hence the post. \n\nI am now NC with her.", "I'm attempting to contact them now but they aren't answering. SIL may have said something to them.", "Ahhh option  3... extending an olive branch and having the other person set it on fire.", "If she did it wouldn\u2019t be surprising you usually get the upper hand in these type of family situations when you address the family first but the fact they let it go on for over a year now is insane it\u2019s not healthy mentally for any one to be acting like that I feel bad for you and your husband because you\u2019ve clearly done nothing wrong yet your being punished.", "Yeah, I was not thinking that was even a possibility. I'm going to be wary in the future with anyone.", "So, I found out that she apparently told them 4 years ago I'm not allowed to around their daughter. MIL watches her daughter daily and I've been over multiple times with my daughter, MIL has never said anything or stopped me from coming over and has even asked me to watch my niece while she did something."]}
