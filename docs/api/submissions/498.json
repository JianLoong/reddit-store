I told her she has to wait like her siblings did.\n\nSo imagine my surprise when today she came home from her dad's and had a phone with her and not just a cheap phone, I don't know much about phones but it looked expensive.\n\nI was furious so I took her phone away and told her she is not getting it back until she turns 12.\n\nShe started to cry and called her dad who called me an asshole for taking the phone away.

YTA.\n\nDad can choose to buy her a phone with his $$.  How he spends his $ isnt your business anymore.\n\nDid it occur to you that Dad did this so he can have more cobtact with daughter?  They can text and do other stuff.\n\nWhy not work with him to put tracking and monitoring/parental controls on that phone to make sure she isnt looking at things she shouldnt and make sure she isnt being bullied by \"friends\" or groomed by strangers online?", "You remind me of that lady on Tik tok who was angry cause her baby daddy bought McDonald's for his kid and not her other kids(who are from different baby daddy's) .", "YTA \n\nHer dad can buy her a gift.

Each of your kids who have different dads are going to have different life experiences and things are never going to be 100% equal.

This is a coparenting issue. I understand that coparenting can be complex (I\u2019m a mom/bonus mom with a complicated ex and H has a narcissistic ex). My bonus daughter has a phone at 10. So we just have rules about that phone that work in our house. Common sense rules. No phone upstairs in her room, no social media, no phone in rooms at bed time, Dad can look at phone, Bark app etc. my boys (11, 8, 6) do not have phones, but are able to understand when they do get one, they will have similar rules. But just taking it away from her would have never worked, and honestly would have been what her mom was after (alienation). Don\u2019t do that. Have boundaries, but arbitrarily taking a phone away because you\u2019re admittedly clueless about technology will only damage your relationship with your daughter.", "YTA... Not for taking the phone while she's at your house: you get to dictate the rules in your house and your rule is no phones until your 12.

You need to set aside your egos, sit down, and have an adult discussion about this situation and how you\u2019ll handle situations like this moving forward.

She deserves to keep her possessions, not have one parent steal something just because the other parents got it for her.\n\nGive her back her phone. Don't replace it with a cheap one in a year.

Hope it was worth it.", "YTA. I don't know what your custody agreement is, but if you don't want her to use her phone in your house that's fine, but you don't get to take it away completely. You should either arrange to have your daughter leave it at her dad's house or ensure it's put away while she's with you and given back when she leaves.

My mom to this day still laments occasionally that she didn't get me a phone earlier because of an incident that happened to my friend and I back in 2010. \n\nMy friend went headfirst down a steep bank in our old village because her bike hit a rock. She ended up with a severe concussion that kept her out of school for nearly a month.\n\nNow why is this relevant?\n\nNeither of us had phones. So 9 year old me, as the uninjured party, had to run around trying to find anyone whose phone I could possibly borrow to try and contact either of our families. In the end I had to trespass onto the caravan park and trust absolute strangers to drive my friend and I back to the main village. I couldn't just walk back up the bank to our houses, because it was too far to leave someone who was so disorientated and had a head wound.\n\nWe were lucky not to be kidnapped or something.\n\nIt is essential that kids have some way of contacting their parents and/or emergency services. Payphones aren't that common of a thing anymore. I've seen maybe two in the uni town I live in at the moment, and I don't think they're operational. If something happens at school, schools can't physically contact every parent right away. \n\nGive her the phone back and re-evaluate your policy.", "I understand your frustration .. to a point .. however this isn\u2019t on your kid so why should they be punished by you taking the phone away ?

Your daughter might feel different or a bit of an outcast being the only one with a different father. To her this was her father giving her the gift she wanted and she felt special, but she probably feels like you're only doing this because of your dislike for her father.\n\nYou could have initially explained to her why you were taking it, but i don't think it wouldve made much difference.\n\n Either way this WILL affect your relationship with her, it just depends how strongly.\n\n(Forgive the wording, and in case anyone was wondering I have been the child in this exact situation.)", "YTA. Instead of going for the root of the issue, i.e. your and her father's inability to agree on the common rules to raise her, you are punishing the daughter for successfully finding a loophole in the rules. If you keep doing that, she'll just keep running to daddy, at some point perhaps permanently.  Her father does indeed have every right to buy his own daughter a phone that he wants her to have, if you haven't communicated and reached a compromise about the phones with him, it's not your daughter's fault. Return the phone, call the father and ask if you can all sit down and find a reasonable compromise about gifts.", "YTA - it wasn\u2019t yours to take.

And the father is equal to you in terms of parental authority, not less.", "YTA....why is it that most of the time people post on here asking if they're the asshole, when the story shows them to be an asshole, they wanna argue that they're not.  What happens in the future if the dad wants to take his daughter to Disney or something, she can't go because your other kids can't go?  He has as much of a right to provide for his daughter as you, it's your fault if you can't afford a fancy fun she shouldn't be punished for having a different dad.", "YTA you aren\u2019t her sole parent, and don\u2019t get to exclusively decide that, and you definitely don\u2019t get to take it from her. I hope her father gets the law involved.", "OP is N T A for wanting her children to be older and possibly more mature before they get a phone.  Constant access to social media can open a child up to serious mental health issues later on.  However, OP, YTA for taking away property that doesn\u2019t belong to you\n\nYou should sit down and talk to your daughter and her father about why you want your daughter to wait to get a phone.  If the father is not in agreement, you can give the phone to him to be kept at his home.  However, you shouldn\u2019t just take it away and keep it from the father.", "YTA\n\nYes, you have the right to say, \u201cno, you have to wait until you are 12\u201d, but that\u2019s a conversation you have with the father. Plus, he has input in how much is spent.", "YTA on so many levels. You cant tell him what he can and cant buy, your other kids are not his responsibility. If your wanting her to resent you then your doing a fantastic job. Keep it up and she just might go NC with you when she gets older.", "A very tentative YTA \nI don\u2019t know your situation, but you say he has no right. Why not? Why do you have the right to decide? Like do you have agreements on this kind of thing?\nI think he should have talked to you about it. I think it\u2019s odd for a parent to give a kid such a big gift without checking with the other parent. \nThat you\u2019re other children live by certain rules doesn\u2019t mean this one automatically shares those rules. She has a different father. The parenting your other kids get is agreed on by you and their father. The daughter this post is about has different rules, negotiated by you and her father. \nI don\u2019t think you were a big asshole. More\u2026it seems weird that you say he has no right, as if you do, anymore than he. But again, I don\u2019t know your situation. And no offense meant.", "YTA\n\nit is not the father's fault that he can afford an expensive phone. However, I do get that other kid may feel jealous but they need to learn that life is unfair. And you only took the phone because you want to be fair to other siblings not because she was rude or had bad grades which are wrong.  And by the looks of it, it is good that the father gave her the phone.", "YTA. This is her father. HIS giving his child a phone has literally no bearing on your other children and their rules. Why do you think it's okay to just take the phone given to her?", "YTA, that\u2019s her phone, that he gave her, you have no legal right to take it away. And PS, all you\u2019re doing right now is creating resentment in her. If you continue along this path and she goes no contact with you after she\u2019s older, don\u2019t be surprised", "YTA your ex is not the parent of your other children and made a decision to buy his child a phone. Why did you take it off her? To make her resent her siblings? You? Why are you the one who gets to make these decisions? And at the very least she should be allowed to keep it when she is with her father. Have you thought about how she felt when you decided to just take it off her?", "YTA. OP You do NOT have the right to dictate to your ex what he buys for your daughter. Since you either split custody or he has visitation privileges, he does have a say in parenting her. I would recommend giving the phone back to her before this becomes a reason to take you back to family court to force a change in custody/visitation.", "YTA. Her father is a parent just like you. He doesn't have to worry about your other kids. That is his property.", "ESH (except your daughter, obviously). A first phone is a decision that both parents should discuss. Her dad did this without consulting with you, which is an AH move. Taking the phone away, however, is also an AH move. Don\u2019t punish your daughter for a shitty decision her father made.", "YTA.  Gift from dad, not for you to tamper with.  Either way 11 makes her what a 6th 7th grader? I bet most of the kids in her classes have some sort of smart phone.  What\u2019s one year to you", "YTA - her dad got her a phone.\n\n It\u2019s called CO-Parenting!!!!\n\nYou don\u2019t get to make all the decisions. His kid too and you can\u2019t take away her gifts from him. \n\nYou literally have taught your daughter that you will steal from her.", "YTA\n\nThe genie has left the bottle OP.  You and Ex failed to communicate and co-parent & now you've taken property that doesn't belong to you to prove a point.  She already has the phone. You can ask Dad to take it back until she's twelve but that's only going to 1)Make her Dad, who's likely already the \"fun\" parent, look like a saint to her (He's an AH too in this scenario) 2)Make your daughter resent you and 3)Stress you further because now you're fighting with Ex AND your daughter both over a phone when there's less than a year to go until 12.\n\nChoose your battles more wisely in the war to raise a decent, kind, humble and, well rounded human being.  As what sounds like the youngest sibling, you're going to have many more instances where circumstances differ significantly enough that you can't parent her EXACTLY as you did your older children. You also have a different person to parent with than you do for the others.  \n\nSpeak with Ex and, if possible create ground rules about the phone based on your child's level of maturity & responsibility that will apply to BOTH households.  Ask him to speak with her about why it is not acceptable to try to use him to skirt the rules at your house and express that this situation has caused you both to lose trust in her.  Speak with your daughter calmly and explain why you're hurt by her circumventing your rules and how this can never happen again. Explain how following these ground rules will help you both regain some of that trust. There's nothing wrong with an appropriate punishment for the deception.", "YTA , unless you had an agreement with your ex on such parenting rules, you have no right to take the phone that you didn't buy from your daughter. Your only recourse is to say she can use phone at father's house only.", "YTA. He\u2019s her parent too", "YTA.

Your ex can press charges for this, give the phone back.", "YTA\n\nHer father is allowed to provide for her. You going to make her refuse college tuition from dad because you can\u2019t provide it for the others? Life isn\u2019t fair and if the other kids are over 12, they know this. It\u2019s not like she is 6, at most she is a few months from 12. You tell the other kids that you would not have gotten her one until 12, but her other parent had input. You are setting yourself up for her choosing to live with her dad.", "YTA, she did nothing wrong and her father got it for her, while I agree 11 is a little young for a phone it\u2019s not like you can take away it without any reason. If it\u2019s about not being fair to the other kids, I agree, you should be fair with them, but you can\u2019t ask everyone to bend to your rules because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.

Her father is her parent just as much as you are. So if he wanted to buy her something, then that's his choice. And for your own sake, you better return the phone. As he was the one who purchased it, not you. Meaning he could call the cops on you for stealing property. Since he hasn't given you permission to take the phone he paid for and gave to his child.", "YTA. I got a phone way earlier than most of my friends because I went through horrible abuse from my dad at his house and my mom wanted to make sure I had a way to call her to come get me out if it got too bad. I honestly hope the dad takes you to court. I think there\u2019s another reason she wanted the phone and you\u2019re punishing her for it.", "YTA he\u2019s her father he has every right to give her that phone and you have no right to steal it. You did not pay for it.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t get to police what her dad gives her.    \nDon\u2019t want her to have a phone til 12, ok maybe but to unilaterally decide that she can\u2019t have a better quality phone is so dictatorial!    \nYou are going to have to accept that she will have different opportunities & material possessions because she has an extra parent. If you continue to punish her for those things, you will alienate her to the point you lose her.", "YTA and unwise.\n\nI used to be like you. I will never forget the day my 11-year-old twins didn\u2019t come back from school when expected. Their grandmother was waiting with me to take them for the weekend...we called their dad, who was also puzzled. The we called the police. Literally the first thing the copper asked was, \u2018Does either kid have a phone?\u2019 I had taken their phones as revocation of a privilege. \n\nThe kids were *fine*. They came sauntering in from an after-school activity that their dad had forgotten he signed the permission slip for (this was years ago, when smartphones were still pretty new and neither of us was adept with the calendars). They arrived just as the cop was getting ready to mobilize some force, and my ex-mother-in-law and I were starting to cry. \n\nPhones are not just a privilege. They are tools of modern life that require as much teaching and parenting as a car, in their way. It\u2019s work, but it\u2019s necessary work. And believe me, I know how communication can go to heck with a coparent, but y\u2019all need to get on the same page about your rules somehow. It\u2019s not on the kid to be an angel, it\u2019s on you two to put in the work to anticipate things that may come up, so the kid knows she can\u2019t win by playing anybody.\n\nSo, probably y\u2019all should get on figuring out your rules for screen time, nighttime phone access, and social media use. Install controls. All that. But communicate about it or you will lose at parenting.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your daughter\u2019s fault she has a father who is financially stable enough to get her an expensive phone when you and your other children\u2019s dad(s) can\u2019t afford anything but cheap phone. You can say your daughter can\u2019t access her phone at your place until she turns 12, sure, but to take her phone away is AH move. \n\nI wonder if your daughter\u2019s father can press charges\u2026just wondering from a legal point of view. He bought it and his ex wife confiscate it. Sounds messy.", "You're just really determined to give him all the ammunition  he needs to get full custody, aren't you?  Since that's his property as her parent who bought it, I hope you're ready for him to press charges and sue you for the value. When a kid has two parents, they both get a say, not just one.  You can't just play by whatever rules you want and not expect consequences.", "How to say you favour your other kids over your daughter, without actually saying it. \n\nYTA.  Her father can do what he wants with his money and your jealous butt can\u2019t do anything about it.   I sincerely hopes not only does he press charges for theft but he seeks sole custody on the grounds of parental alienation. \n\nOut of curiosity what else of your daughters that her father bought her, that you\u2019ve taken because it\u2019s not fair to your other children?  I\u2019m betting this isn\u2019t the first time.", "YTA.

You\u2019re not the all magical oz lmao you sound like an entitled brat", "YTA, you didn't pay for it, you don't own it, it's not yours - you stole it from her. If you were angry he bought her one you should've had a conversation with HIM, not take her property.", "THIS RIGHT HERE.  OP YTA, but mainly for how you handled it. Your daughter came home with an expensive phone. Instead of calling dad to talk about it, you just grabbed it from her and said she can't have it.  No need for that drama and you hurt your daughter. Instead you should've explained, that while dad may  have different rules, your rules still apply at your house. So just either limit her time or tell her to leave phone at dads.", "Maybe the dad got her a phone so now she can text or call him any time she likes *with privacy*", "OP can take the phone away while at her house but she can't keep it when the child goes back to her father's house.", "Right?? How she chose to parent her other kids with THEIR Dad is a totally different situation from how this child's dad chooses to parent her and that's just how it's going to be. Mom's going to have to get used to it since she didn't pay for it and gets no say. It's not like he bought her a pony and dropped it off at her house ffs", "And daughter can leave the phone at Dad\u2019s house... Problem solved\n\nETA - seems like everyone is forgetting that OP\u2019s daughter knew the rule. She didn\u2019t like it so she ran to Daddy & he gave her what she wanted. That\u2019s called acting like a brat. So unless Dad has a good explanation of why he ignored Mom\u2019s rule, it\u2019s going right back to Dad\u2019s house. No one should be rewarding this behavior. Makes sense to me (good luck when she\u2019s a teenager & thinks she can do whatever she wants because Dad said she could)\n\nETA more - I still think OP is T.A. for her overreacting to this situation. Way too much drama. This was an adult conversation that could\u2019ve easily been resolved. But you don\u2019t just ignore the other parent\u2019s rules. Also, all kids can act like brats so settle down. It\u2019s not that big of a deal. I\u2019m not blaming the kid for having 2 idiot parents. All kids need to learn No is an acceptable answer & an 11 yr old should understand what the word no means. They are playing tug-of-war with their kid & teaching her she can manipulate the adults who should be making decisions for her safety, health, well-being together! Not a good lesson. This kid knew she wasn\u2019t meant to have a phone at Mom\u2019s until she was 12. Kid can go ahead & ask Dad who then \u201cshould\u201d talk to Mom to see how to work it out. But Dad doesn\u2019t call Mom for any reason, not even to just give a heads-up \u201chey I decided to get kid a phone we should talk about how that\u2019s going to work before I drop her off\u201d ... Dad let\u2019s kid waltz in to Mom\u2019s & deal with the fallout. He set his daughter up for failure. These parents are more concerned about who is in charge, meanwhile the 11 yr old is running the show", "^^^ My father did the same thing. I had visitation with him on weekends. He got me a phone so I can 1) talk to friends but 2) talk to him more.", "It sounds like you and dad hadn't conversed about the topic. I can understand wanting to have the same rule/situation for all your children, but (a) your ex isn't a mind reader, so you can't expect him to know what you were thinking re: timing of her first phone, and (b) even if he **did** know your wishes, he is well within his rights to buy his kid a phone, especially as it seems like she is away from him a significant part of the time. YTA, and (at least in most states) you can be legally compelled to return her phone to her if pushed", "Because OP doesn't care if her daughter experiences something inappropriate online, she cares that her daughter has something nice.", "I didn't even think of this. Maybe OP is trying to cut off communication between her daughter and her father.", "I remember seeing that also!

They don't communicate and it affects the kid(s) they had together. They don't act like responsible adults when it comes to interacting with each other.", "Absolutely. Not sure why people disregard basic communication with this! Dad should\u2019ve at least told her, not asked, that he was getting the kid a phone. He kinda threw the kid to the wolves there and caused a blow up.", "Agreed! The parents need to communicate before there is a conflict. Mom has a no phones rule that dad knew about and helped their dayghter circumvent. If he thought she should have one they should have talked and found a compromise, neither party should decide unilaterally.", "Dude, for real. It really bothered me that she told dad \"You have no right to buy her a phone\"... Like dude, he's her dad... It literally is his right to do that", "I think he might had, but OP had closed it with she is not old enough, without arguerments why. Sound like her child had been ready for quite some time.", "Then it perhaps should be \"this is something you have at your dad's\" \nOr the dad had actually sat down and talked to OP about he was gonna buy her a phone.\nTaking it away completely is not within OP's right no, but I can see how it will seem unfair to the other children if OP just completely cave in. It will open the door that as long as dad buys it OP's house rules doesn't count, and the kid can suddenly march around with stuff the others couldn't, or are straight against the rules in OP's House rules.", "I also find it deeply concerning that the cost of the phone is all OP is worried about. A more important concern would be if OP and ex agreed on and had mutual access to this magical thing called safety features.\n\nBut no, the 'unfairness' of her other kids not being able to have as nice stuff is the real issue here. \ud83d\ude44", "OP this right here.  Dad can certainly have his own rules at his place. Did you even talk to dad about this rule of yours and see if he agreed?  If so, he may have agreed to wait. But even if he didn't you handled this situation extremely poorly. YTA", "OP decided her word was law. Why does the dad not get any input? I'm kind of surprised the daughter hasn't had a phone before this, so she can communicate easier with whichever parent she's not with at that time. Given how there doesn't appear to be an open and ongoing discussion for coparenting, I would think they'd be happy to talk to their kid without interacting with the other parent.\n\nFYI, TAKING THE PHONE IS THEFT OP.", "Also, I am pretty sure this would be considered theft. It was purchased by the father, and given as a gift. The OP has no ownership over the phone. Also, it doesn't sound like these parents are co-parenting. They should be discussing these decisions together. OP made a decision without consulting the father and the same for the father.", "Parents have to decide on rules together. It doesn't work when you change rules on weekly basis. Children need stability", "The phone is the Dads property. Legally OP should return the phone to him. I vote YTA because OP you do seem controlling on this and since you are not paying for the phone you need to give it back to the Dad. Daughter can use it when she is with Dad.", "I agree. This is just so much Seriously. Just WTH to me? He's her dad. He gets to make decisions independently that don't hurt other people. Keeping contact with his child is a pretty normal expectation in divorced couple land.\n\nMy cousin's ex-wife used to spend all of of his visitation time keeping the kids on the phone with her until a judge explained to her that this was custodial interference and her ex-husband could in fact turn the phones off during his visitation. It cost him a mound of money to make this point with her crazy behind in court too.\n\nThis lady's ex is not abusing her visitation time. He's just maintaining contact with the child.\n\nI can call my kids on the phone, so why shouldn't he be able to?", "YTA. Why should you be the only one to make such a decision ? Her father has a right to offer her a phone if he pays for it", "I totally agree. OP seems envious that her daughter's dad was able to buy her a better phone than what she was able to buy.", "Then she can keep it at his house.", "IMO, OP and her daughter's dad should have discussed the matter together and OP should take some input from outside. If OP's daughter really wants a phone, why don't buy it? Maybe not a really expensive one, but still a phone. OP can invent an excuse to her other children on why she bought the phone for her daughter before her 12th b-day.", "Especially since he's not with her all the time. With her own phone she can call him whenever she wants from wherever she is. I'm not someone who thinks it's a good idea to give very young children cell phones (although I don't think 11 is too young) but to me an exception is when the parents are divorced. If my child were not living with me full-time I'd want to be able to reach them and have them be able to reach me at all times.", "And it isn\u2019t hers to take away like that. It belongs to the father and the kid. He\u2019s paying for it. The rules can be decided together, but it\u2019s not like it was taken away as punishment for misbehaving. It was taken away because she wants to be fair in a situation that just isn\u2019t going to be that way.\n\nMy oldest niece has a different dad. She had differences growing up because of that. Her four siblings had to just understand that her situation is different than theirs. You can\u2019t dictate all things for your kid when you\u2019re suppose to be coparenting. It would have been nice if he had talked to you first, but it\u2019s still not just up to you. YTA give her the phone back as it isn\u2019t yours to take.", "If I were her Dad I would call the police since you stole the property he paid for.

The moment my school schedule meant that I\u2019d be home 10 minutes before my mom at age 7, I had a phone. Of course it only called 5 numbers that were pre programmed but I had a way to contact my mom and emergency services. (The little red kids flip phone if anyone remembers it, cutest phone I\u2019ve ever had!) Like what if the kid is out for a walk and finds a lost animal or something? There\u2019s a major convenience in being able to at least call your parents for help with different situations or if you need to be picked up etc.\n\nA smartphone makes sense with parental controls for an 11yo to be able to FaceTime their dad, etc. But up to this point I\u2019d imagine there\u2019s many situations where the kid couldn\u2019t call someone when they needed to, geez. \n\nI understand not wanting the risks of a smartphone, but in that case OP needs to provide a reasonable alternative, such as using FaceTime on OP\u2019s phone or other device at request instead, and I feel like the dad got this phone specifically because that likely hasn\u2019t been happening. Everyone basically needs to communicate more.", "This is a judgment that has knowledge and experience behind it, and well done honestly in a very complicated sounding situation. The only thing I have to add, which you pointed out too, OP needs to educate herself, at a minimum, on phone technology for the sake and safety of all of her children, I personally feel it is completely irresponsible not to. \n\nYTA OP, not meant in a derogatory way here, I truly think you could learn something from the above advice.", "Yes, this. YTA OP.", "I don\u2019t like the idea of taking the phone while she\u2019s mom\u2019s house either. Yes maybe dad just bought her a phone just because he felt like, or is trying to be the fun parent, or wants to spite his ex. But maybe he bought it because her mother makes it difficult for the child to communicate with her father when she is at her mother\u2019s house. Maybe he is ensuring daughter has a way to communicate with him that is not governed by her mother.", "Yes, that would be a reasonable compromise. But OP doesn't want that, she stole the phone and is going to keep it for months", "I obviously don\u2019t know how OP acts/parents day-to-day, but the side of OP we\u2019ve seen here is controlling and reactionary. Dad might have a reason for especially wanting his daughter to have a direct way to communicate with him when daughter is at her mother\u2019s house.", "Exactly. I bought my son a basic phone when he was 8 because his dad refused to answer the land line if I called. Having said that, it really was a basic phone, he didn't get a smart phone until he was 15 (about 10 years ago).

It is not normal to give an 8 year old a phone. My 8 year old doesn't have a phone, he barely understands the concept of the internet. OP is NTA for not giving her 11 year old a phone. I bought my first one at 16 with my own money. I had no need for a cell phone when I can use a landline. If her mom is primary parent and has majority custody, then yes, she can take away the phone. Dad only bought her the phone cause mom said no cause she didn't want to wait one more year. That is entitlement behavior and it shouldn't be tolerated. Both parents need to be in agreement on things like this but it needs to be talked about first. The kid only wanted the phone cause she wanted to fit in. That's not a good reason to give a kid a phone. Kids barely understand the harms that come with phones a social media and how detrimental it can be to their mental health at young ages. It is dangerous to give a kid free reign with a cell phone at 11. These things need talked about at length and great discussion and all parties understand the potential problems that come from the responsibility of owning a cell phone. And at 11 no kid should have a cell phone that has access to the internet and certain apps. You clearly don't have children or understand how dangerous a phone in a child's hands can be.

Not good) he went back to being the man from when I was younger who treated me with respect. \n\nIf he'd started that when I was any younger or he hadn't said sorry and meant it we wouldn't be talking now. And when he had his stroke and subsequent seizures for years my sister and I wouldn't have taken care of him.", "Oml SAME\n\nabout the \"getting my first phone at 9 part,\" my parents divorced and got me a phone to properly contact them, it worked pretty well.", "My youngest got a phone at 8, after the school put her on the wrong bus AND LOST HER for hours!!! Now she can contact us in an emergency and we can track her location if they lose her again!!!", "FYI, if you are in the US, if a company gives or sends you something by accident that you did not order they legally can not make you to pay for it or return it. You can choose to, but you don\u2019t have to.\n\nSource: https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-youre-billed-things-you-never-got-or-you-get-unordered-products", "And if you read my comments from the start OP is the AH. My comment about put it in the cabinet when you come here is how it should have been handled.\n\nIt wasn't which makes OP the AH.", "My daughter is 10 and doesn't have a phone yet. I told her when I was a kid we had payphones. Literally everywhere and everyone knew how to call collect if they didn't have change. My kid looked at me like I grew another head. \ud83e\udd72", "I think that might be a bit much. There are so many reasons that people split up and many of those reasons could be completely out of OP's control. I'm not defending her actions by taking her daughters phone away by any means but to say someone is irresponsible for having more than one partner in life is insulting.", "Yeah I've heard this before. I had a roommate who was one of the holier than thou types he was always degrading a woman's rights to minister in the church,and said any religion other than his religion was a false religion (I'm Lutheran) and that the religion I followed was a terrible choice because we had women ministers. Yet this is the same guy who if someone put down his political party without them even asking what he thought would butt in.", "Dude.... What the actual fuuuuuu.....\n\nWow....", "Yeah they never would have known if I hadn't said anything and I guess technically they still don't since they didn't take it back lol, but I was trying to do the right thing even if everybody acted like I was nuts", "Totally true and that's hilarious. But, and this may just be me I swear, I haven't seen a working pay phone as long as I've been on the planet. A phone that can at the very least call and text is almost imperative now.", "If you have kids by multiple partners then their life experiences are inevitably going to be unique. If you can't handle that then make sure all your kids have one father.", "Yeah, there are a few like that. Question, was he also against using instruments in the church? That's Church of Christ (not the Mormon one, there is another that doesn't use latter day saints) That's not the one my dad was in but they are one of the groups that says they are the only ones going to heaven. Which is hilarious because Jesus said you only need faith the size of a mustard seed.\n\nI've given up on any group of people who says they have the answers, personally. But at one point I was going to three services a week and two classes, plus high school and then a job. Make that two jobs during the summer. Then I kept that up while going to a religious college for one semester. But my professors had a very mixed view of me. If I agreed with the answer I was supposed to give on a test or report I'd use two Bible verses to back it up. If I disagreed I'd put, \"the author said _____ and used ____ verse to back it up. But the context changes the meaning of the verse\" and give however much before and after, and then three to five other verses to support my view in a report. On a test I would put, \"you/the author said _____\" because I refused to write something I didn't believe as the truth but also knew the answer they would consider correct. Many of my professors loved it. They enjoyed having someone who actually took the time to tell them why I felt the way I did instead of either just being belligerent or regurgitating the answers. But some were offended that a mere girl dared to have any opinions of her own, especially ones that didn't line up with what her mighty professors were telling her!", "Yeah, I've only ever seen one phone box in my life and have no idea if it even ever worked. It looked kinda old and not particularly maintained", "He was baptist his beliefs about women came from first Timothy (not sure which chapter or verses without opening a Bible). But let me tell you women played a big part in the bible(Martha,Mary, Mary Magdalen, Lydia, and Tabitha aka Dorcas) just to name  a few. His views on things like the apostles Creed and the lord's prayer were skewed slightly too.", "Same. I don't have kids, so who knows if I should even have an opinion, but the way I see it, every single human should have a reliable phone for emergencies."]}
