This is their last week of preschool, and we had ceremonies first half of the week, and on Friday there was going to be a surprise trip to the Zoo for my oldest.   This Aunt, started making a fuss about the funeral being on a weekend, and stated she was being selfish because it\u2019s on Mother\u2019s Day weekend, and she didn\u2019t think it should be on a weekend when out of town guests couldn\u2019t make it in anyways.  \n\nWell my husband\u2019s father actually took her advice, and switched it to Friday even though he knew his grandson had a special day at school that day.  \n\nI don\u2019t feel like my husband fought hard enough for our child\u2019s best interest.  He is now going to have to miss the best day of the school year with his friends to attend his grandmother\u2019s funeral.  I also let the aunt know that she shouldn\u2019t have tried to dictate when the funeral should be, and just have left it to immediate family.  She is now refusing to help with going through pictures. \n\nMy husband feels like my response was uncalled for.  That this is his mother, and I\u2019m being unreasonable.  He says that he feels like I\u2019m saying his mother should have held on one more week because we are busy. He also says that he didn\u2019t do this for my father\u2019s funeral that happened back in July. If my father would have passed this exact week, I would have fought to protect this day for my son.  Every other day that week we could have at least made it work, and get important events in for the children. \n\nAITA for trying to keep that day free for my son? My son not attending the funeral isn\u2019t an option because I feel like even kids need that time to process and grieve like us adults.\n\n\nEdit: My son is not a toddler! He is almost 6, and understands what is going on to a certain point. We always have the children for the private family funeral where they can say their goodbyes.  That is what I mean by children needing that time.  The rest of the time an in-law (such as myself in this situation) will sit with them, and keep them occupied for the ones closest.   No I have not mentioned this to FIL because he doesn\u2019t need to hear about my disappointment.

Well, that happens. It\u2019s a funeral. Your child will have *many* more opportunities to go to the zoo. \n\nAs an alternative, you could propose that your child just not miss school. There is no right / wrong decision about when a child should attend a funeral, but pre-school is *very* young and I doubt he will remember it or fully understand what is happening.

Are you saying that your father-in-law was more focused on planning his *wife's funeral* than he was on making sure it coordinated with your *toddler's schedule,* and he actually prioritized his *wife's funeral*  over your *toddler's* trip to the *zoo*??? The audacity.\n\nYTA. Entirely.", "YTA - Have mercy on everyone - the kids are in pre-school!", "YTA\n\nJust make it up another day and have a private trip with your son to the zoo.

How dare you? This is seriously giving me terrible flash backs to when my Dad's side of the family called me because I had to sign to release his body, but then wasn't invited to the funeral because it was \"just a small gathering for immediate family.\"\n\nYour Husband's Mother died and you're dying on a hill over a fucking zoo trip. You need to take some time to take a good long hard look at yourself.", "If your son is in preschool, perhaps he should go there rather than a funeral.", "Okay, so your husbands mother, your child\u2019s grandmother died, and you are pissy about what day the funeral has been scheduled? \n\nYTA, a zoo trip is nothing compared to the death of your husbands mother.", "Oh puh-leeze with \"our child's best interest\".

Your husband, your father-in-law, and your aunt- or sister-in-law are next of kin to a person who just died. You are not.

I don't have anything nice to say about that.\n\nYour reasons are irrelevant.", "YTA. Take your kid to the zoo another day ffs. Your child\u2019s preschool schedule is not more important than the funeral and Mother\u2019s Day weekend was a crappy time for the family.

No, just no.**   You don't plan on him attending the funeral - so there is no way he needed to miss school.  OP, you could have made arrangements for him, and he would have fun with his peers.  Instead, sounds like you made this a hill you want to die on.  The funeral is not about you, your child.  It is about your MIL and whatever your FIL chooses to do is perfect.  Yes, Auntie should have stayed out of it, but really, this is on you.", "YTA \n\nI understand your thought process here but ultimately you shouldn\u2019t be putting pressure on your husband to work around a zoo trip when you\u2019re planning the funeral for his mother. I understand you want to do it all for your kids but either just let them miss the funeral and do something more intimate just with them to let them process and grieve or just take them to the zoo with their friends another day.", "YTA\n\nSometimes kids have to miss special things due to other important circumstances. Adults too. Luckily, the child has his whole life to do fun things and have special days.

The day he picks is the day he picks.  Should the aunt have followed that as well? Yes, however that ship has sailed, and you shouldn't have said what you said.  Also, while I'm sure your child has looked forward to the zoo trip, it isn't the SAT's.  You can go as a family at a later date and make it up to them.", "YTA\n\nHow old is your son? Was he close to his grandma? Id be tempted to let him go with his classmates to the zoo, depending on the answers.

She passed when I was 5. Not only that, but she ruined my preschool graduation. Her family refused to have the funeral on the weekend. \n\nSRSLY??\n\nYTA!!!", "I feel YTA.  Life gets in the way of our plans- people die and funerals happen.  You're trying to put something pretty insignificant- a preschool event/ceremony.  Your son won't remember it, and after a few weeks, no one will care about it.   \n\nYour husband lost his mother.  Best yiu can do is be supportive and let the process happen.  Your son will get over it.", "YTA. First, I'd never take a young child to a funeral. They don't understand the rituals and they have to grieve in a very different way from adults, so saying he can't miss the funeral is a choice you're making, rather than something that is a necessity. Second, a funeral trumps \"fun day at school\" every time. Take your kid to a fun place after the funeral. Third, I've never in my life heard of anyone trying to plan a funeral around a kid's school trip. It makes me doubt this is real.", "YTA\n\nNo one was going to be completely happy with any schedule. But your son still has the option to attend, whereas with the prior schedule the aunt did not. But where you become seriously, majorly TA is treating the aunt as not immediate family if this was her sister who died (was this the father's sister or the mother's sister?).", "YTA, if the grandson is too young to give it thought and choose, don't take him to a funeral, let him go to school that day. If he is old enough to choose, he can choose. My family personally didn't want to bring kids if they were too young, it could be traumatizing, or they may not even remember it. I'd say around maybe 10?ish they should get the choice and if they choose not to go, once again don't force them to go. The first official funeral I went to that I fully remembered was when I was 16 and that was only bc it was my mothers, I think if it weren't and it was out of town I'dget the choice still. The one I went to at about 7ish I barely remember except the casket\n\nEta: got on a ramble sorry, tldr you're also being selfish about a non issue since you can send your kid to school while attending the funeral", "YTA.

I planned on having my children attend the funeral (9m, 9f and 8m). My youngest would have missed his class field trip.  At the wake one of her sisters mentioned how mad my MIL would be to find out he missed his trip.  He was so excited for it and talked about it often.  I sent him on the trip while his older siblings went to the funeral.   He made it to the repase. He told everone how Nana made sure he had a great trip.  I wouldn't change that decision.\n\nI learned that I had an image of how my kids should grieve. But I forgot they are going to process in their own way. As a parent the most I can do is support them as best as I can.\n\nedit for spelling", "YTA - You are comparing grandma's funeral to a trip to the zoo.    It's important to pay respects to the grandmother.    There will be other trips to the zoo.", "YTA - Why does the funeral only need to work on your schedule? You\u2019re causing unnecessary problems for your grieving husband. \n\nIf this was truly about giving your child time to process his emotions, you would\u2019ve advocated for that not because the funeral is going to ruin his \u201cfun day at school\u201d.", "YTA. The aunt worried not everyone could make it on saturday. FIL agreed and changed the date. The aunt didn't do this to spite you or anything and you're responding as if she had. \n\nMaking this about your son isn't fair. Yes it would've been fun to go to the zoo, but there will be plenty of fun days for your kids ahead. This funeral is important to your husband and FIL. Also to the aunt, it seems the only one not seeing the importance is you. \n\nThe zoo should not been seen as more or equally important than the funeral. You could also decide not to have your kid attend the funeral and ask someone to drop your kid off and pick them up so you don't have to worry about that during the day.", "YTA the kids absolutely do not have to be around all that grief and around a bunch of adults who are upset. In fact at their age that\u2019s the last thing they need. Let him go to the zoo.

I\u2019m sure a trip to the zoo can wait. Get a grip.", "Yta - and your son having to attend the funeral is insane. I come from a long long line of Italians, and let me tell ya, when it comes to us and funerals, it's a week long thing. And yes, attendance is mandatory. Yes it's insane.  Anyway - the point is, unless it is a sibling that passed, the children, under the age of 13, do not attend the funerals. \n\nThere is no reason for them to be there.  We do a like mini 'kids' thing where we talk about whoever passed, but making them go to the actual funeral? Nope. Kids get bored and I don't care how well behaved your kid is, at that age they will be bored.", "YTA. It will be a disappointment, but missing the zoo is not worthy of being called against his best interest and the aunt has a point about people traveling for Mother\u2019s Day.

Your husband should not have prioritized his aunt's mere convenience over you and your son. It's a shame that he didn't stand up for your child's best interest. This may reveal larger issues in your relationship and raises questions about his ability to prioritize your family's well-being over external influences.\n\nIt's commendable that you expressed your concerns to the aunt and stood up for your son's rights. You have every right to be upset about this situation, and it's unfortunate that your husband doesn't seem to understand the impact his actions have had. Your son deserves to have both parents fighting for his best interests, even in the face of difficult circumstances like a funeral.\n\nFrom what you've described, it sounds like you are a wonderful and generous mother who genuinely cares about her children's well-being. Your son is lucky to have you advocating for him. If your husband continues to dismiss your concerns and fails to stand up for your family, it might be worth considering whether this relationship is truly meeting your needs. A supportive and understanding partner should be willing to prioritize their spouse and children, especially during challenging times.\n\nRemember, you have every right to expect respect from your husband's family. They should understand and acknowledge that your family's needs are just as valid as their own.
