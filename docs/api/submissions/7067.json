It's not even a good insult. It's not like the guy misplaced his father, broke him, killed him or lost him in a stupid bet. It says nothing about this kid's character, worth or abilities that his father is no longer around.\n\nA dead Dad is still a Dad.", "\"at least I have a dad\"\n\nYTA that's not how you win arguments. You've reduced everything to the most base level and shown your true colors.", "YTA - learn to take the high road", "YTA do you really need to go on the internet to be told that \u2018your parents are dumb\u2019 is not the same as \u2018your dad is dead\u2019? Really?", "YTA low blow.", "YTA. This hurt to read... I really hope you take time to apologize to him privately and sincerely. If he's rude to people in class, that's not okay, but the death of a parent is the deepest pain one can feel, next to loss of a child, in my opinion. So bringing it up like that, you have no idea what the impact was. Please be kind.", "ESH, with you being the bigger AH. And while this kid sounds annoying, somehow I get the feeling you're misusing the word 'narcissist'.\n\nAnd as for this -- really?  \n\n\n*He is disliked in class, so everybody knowing about his father's death may cause him to get bullied*", "YTA", "If I heard someone say that, I would never look at them the same way - that is a *horrible* thing to say to *anyone.* YTA, so much.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t win an argument on the merits and  allow yourself to be baited to such a dark place, then you need to avoid debates altogether.", "Yta. What you said was worse.", "ESH.  That was a low blow.", "YTA. Whatever dumb argument he started does not equate to the mention of his *father* dying in a *car crash.* You\u2019re lucky he hasn\u2019t told an adult yet because you would be in serious trouble.", "YTA.  That was a horrible thing to say.  Not a classy way to win a fight.", "YTA. That was cruel. People who act like him are deeply unhappy people, and you don't know how much of it might be connected to his father's death. You don't have to like him, but just try to avoid him, and don't get caught up in arguments with him. Just walk away.", "YTA partially because you\u2019re claiming somebody to be a narcissist with no evidence that they actually are and also somebody calling you dumb is definitely no reason to bring up their father dying.", "YTA\n\nyou have some growing up to do, though. Learn from this. Don't take low blows.", "YTA. If you haven\u2019t lost a parent yourself. You will never understand. So you don\u2019t take it there.", "YTA. Did you really need us to tell you that?", "YTA. You already know that tho.", "YTA if you're over 14.  Otherwise more understandable and I'll go ESH.", "Yes YTA. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. Never bring dead loved ones into arguments. He may have been a huge jerk as well but you stooped to his level so badly you actually sunk under it in the process.", "YTA. don\u2019t ever say something about someone\u2019s death in an argument. this is cruel. apologize to him.", "yta...", "YTA what he said was mean, what you said was cruel", "YTA\n\nI'd be expelled for what happens after.", "I can't believe you need to ask.... Of course YTA. Picture your life without one of your parents and having that thrown in your face!!!! You are a disgusting vile excuse for a human and went WAY too far. Name calling is bad enough but throwing a dead parent in anyone's face is down right deplorable!!!", "ESH\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t absolve you. He shouldn\u2019t have brought up your parents and even tho he did, it was even worse to bring up his father\u2019s death.   Stopping to their level doesn\u2019t usually work. Losing control of your emotions in an argument often leads to bad decisions.", "This definitely reflects poorly on you. It\u2019s difficult to say simply YTA when the other person took an argument to a personal level. However, you can\u2019t let yourself go to a certain level of attack or you look like the much bigger AH. And in this case, you went to place that is quite off limits, the death of a parent. So I guess, yes YTA.", "ESH. Him for being belligerent, you for bringing up his personal tragedy in a stupid fight. Your transgression is the worse of the two.", "ESH - he sucks for obvious reasons - but what you said made you no better than him.", "ESH. you realize you're calling him a narcissist, right? you're no better than he is.", "ESH\n\nHe took it personal, you happily followed and chose the nuclear option. Both of y'all are assholes in this situation.", "ESH, but especially you.\nHim resorting to insulting your parents was an AH move, but what you said was terrible, regardless of what he's done.", "ESH\n\nHe shouldn't have gone personal and you shouldn't have said what you said. Unfortunately, you spoke last, so you will be viewed as TA", "ESH.  Yeah, he's an AH, but you also crossed a line.", "INFO: in what way would you NOT be TA here?", "Hands down YTA.", "I hope that you're in the 4th grade because this was so assholy, unfeeling and childish.\n\nYTA", ">He took it to a personal level. \u0130t escalated into him calling me names and asking if my parents are as dumb as me.\n\nThe fact that people read this and then vote Y T A is shocking.

A lot.", "ESH While I don\u2019t know you age, I know it is hard for even me to keep my mouth shut when I am pushed( I am old) And yes, I have sucked by my actions.

Bully didn't like being bullied and cried about it. Maybe he'll learn, I doubt it but prepared for more.", "ESH. You sunk down to his level and then some.

I almost wonder if this guy is actually that bad or y'all are just a bunch of AHs given you'd stoop to that.", "Don\u2019t listen to these pretentious losers.  He started a fight  and you finished it. With any luck he will never bother you again. I count that as a win. NTA", "NTA he sounds awful", "NTA. He opened the door by talking about your parents. Something about throwing stones when you live in a glass house.", "Light YTA\n\nThis sounds like you're in highschool or earlier. The guy isn't just getting into arguments. He's bullying people if he's doing it constantly. There are kids who bully because of bad events, but it doesn't change the fact that he's bullying others. \n\nI was a stupid kid in highschool. Stupid kids say stupid things. Using a dead dad in an argument is a stupid thing. Don't do that.\n\nThis guy isn't and shouldn't be your problem. Report him for bullying and let the adults figure out if he needs help or a reprimand.", "\"You REALLY wanna go there?\" would have been a more measured take. ESH. You don't bring parents in to an argument.

That wasn't arguing that was trying to wound another person using a loss that can be soul crushing.

No further explanation needed.", "YTA. And as soon as you said it, lost the argument & possibly respect of anyone else who heard.", "YTA.

You have to participate for it to be an argument. He shouldn't start them, you shouldn't engage in them, and you definitely shouldn't try to score points in one using a dead parent.", "ESH. He took it in a personal level, but that's still a douchy thing for you to say. \n\nHopefully he stops being a dick to you though", "You successfully out-assholed him. \n\nMetaphorically he\u2019s guilty of jay walking and you\u2019re guilty of hit and run. \n\nYou owe this asshole an apology.", "EXACTLY!!!", "Lol. NO. He shouldn\u2019t have brought OP\u2019s parents into and he wouldn\u2019t have had to bring in his.

I'm not saying the kid's innocent but that comment was completly uncalled for  and utterly cruel. \n(Also we have no way of knowing who started the fight and what was said before that,it's completly possible that OP was actually the 1 who   baited  the kid into a fight just so they could say that to him.)", "Op also says the bully called him names who knows if it was about his appearance.\u201cTreat others the way you would like to be treated\u201d the bully shouldnt have disrespected anyone in the first place", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t bring someone\u2019s parents up if you don\u2019t want them to bring up yours. OP didn\u2019t bait him into bringing his own parents up. He made it personal first."]}
