My wife and our friend group go back from all meeting at college over 15 years ago. There is a group of 9 of us that all met, got married and we still make an effort to see each other and talk as often as we can.\n\nIt used to be 10 people, but our buddy Luke and his ex-wife divorced about 3 years ago. Now we don\u2019t know this for sure, but we\u2019re fairly certain that Luke\u2019s wife was cheating on him, so when we heard they were divorcing, we all cut her off. Interestingly she didn\u2019t seem to mind all that much but whatever. \n\nLuke went through a very dark period, and I don\u2019t blame him. We all supported him, and thankfully he made it through. About a year and a half ago, he met his current girlfriend, Megan. \n\nMegan is an absolute sweetheart and we all really enjoy her presence, and enjoy seeing Luke happy again. Now to the issue.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, me and the guys of the friend group met up as we were all in the same area. This involved going out and having one too many drinks, and from there we ended up out in the garage drinking more and talking late into the night. At a certain point, Luke drunkingly revealed that he still has feelings for his ex, but it isn\u2019t a big deal because he knows the relationship is over. Now I HATE cheaters, I\u2019ve been cheated on, so I point blank asked him if he would cheat. He said absolutely not, he knew that chapter was over, but still had some remaining feelings he was working though. It was a good enough answer for me.\n\nSo I went to go to the bathroom, and I walked outside to see my wife with her ear to a different door eavesdropping. Her face is white and eyes all big. That pissed me off for one. She then drags me inside and says that we need to tell Megan, and it\u2019s our duty as friends. \n\nI told her to mind her own business, and let Luke figure this out. If she tells Megan a drunken conversation (who knows if he even remembers it) and she leaves him, it will absolutely break Luke.\n\nShe agreed and I thought it was the end of it.\n\nThe next day, she said she had thought about it more, and would be telling Megan if I didn\u2019t do anything. We again had a conversation about it, and it turned into a large argument. I again told her she needs to mind her own business.

Lucky you.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you give Luke a heads up about what is about to happen, maybe he can get ahead of it. Your wife wants to tell Megan, and you can\u2019t realistically do anything to stop her. \n\nA drunken confession to a trusted group of friends that one might still have feelings for an ex is *not* an expression of a willingness or intent to cheat. Your  wife is blowing this alll out of proportion. \n\nIf I were Luke this would be the end of my friendship with your wife. And you, too, since you have an eavesdropper wife. The end, even if she decided not to blab to Megan. It would be the end, because I would never be comfortable, wondering what she might take out of context or extrapolate and cause a  shit show. And this may well lead to a splintering of the friend group, too. I am sorry. NTA", "Nta your wife was being intentionally nosy and is trying to start shit. If Luke had said he cheated that would be one thing, but the man hasn't done anything wrong at this point. Having residual feelings after a breakup is normal.\nEdited to fix typo.", "NTA, he confessed something deeply personal, in confidence, and he\u2019s working through it. Your wife needs to butt out! She\u2019s meddling in something that doesn\u2019t need to be meddled in, and will certainly cause unnecessary suffering", "NTA. Your wife is. \n\nThere is no significant revealed risk that Luke will cheat. No preemptive warning is ethically required. Indeed, Luke\u2019s resolve to work through his feelings demonstrates a healthy mental attitude and bodes well for his new relationship.\n\nYour wife acquired the information unethically. She deliberately eavesdropped on a conversation that was not meant for her and learned about an individual\u2019s inner emotions and struggles.\n\nShe\u2019s not in any way doing the right thing. Her belief that Luke might cheat is speculative at best and actually appears unfounded. This makes her a malicious busybody acting in bad faith, likely to satisfy some petty need for drama and to use the power that having possession of someone else\u2019s secret gives her.\n\nI recommend responding to her ultimatum with one of your own which carefully lays out the consequences of her ill-advised course of action.", "Wow, really not sure what your wife's motivation is for telling Megan.

He's not cheating, he's just dealing with left over feelings--that is something he needs to do--not your wife to stick finger in pie.\n\nSo going with ESH.", "Am I the only one that thinks the friend group generally sounds less than great? You all dropped a friend of over a decade (Luke\u2019s ex-wife) on his suspicion in the middle of what was obviously a difficult divorce, since he\u2019s still having a tough time. Did anyone care to hear her side? You were supposed to be her friends, no? This is unfortunately why the whole \u201cI married my high school/college sweetheart\u201d stuff gets mocked on social media - because it seems to lead directly to immaturity and a lack of understanding of the complexity of adult relationships. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong to marry that person but you should try to grow more together if possible because this behavior in adults kind of sucks. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA OP, but your wife (and sounds like many people in your friend group) missed out on some important adult lessons that it\u2019s time to learn. First and foremost, stay out of other people\u2019s relationships and be good friends who offer and care support and mean it.", "NTA.\n\nYou seem to be in an impossible situation.  I would suggest talking to Luke so he can head this all off with Megan.  Plus you can vouch for Luke that he said he would not cheat ever (and your wife might be willing to let it go as long as she feels Megan heard about it; then she might feel she did at least get her warned.)  This is not a great solution and could backfire, but it is definitely better than your wife telling Megan and turning nothing into something.", "So you dropped a friend over suspicions of cheating, but you  don't want your wife to say anything in case it implodes your friend group?\n\nOut of curiosity, what's the chances it was Luke that was the issue in the previous relationship?

I am so sorry for you.", "ESH, except Megan. Like you said, your wife is going to get you guys ostracized from the group. But Megan deserves to know that her boyfriend has unresolved feelings for his ex. He should tell her himself. He should not be in a relationship with these unresolved feelings.", "What is this!? NTA.\n\nDid Luke's ex-wife immediately start sagging in Luke's memories after the divorce? No? Then this is perfectly normal. You asked the correct question and got the correct answer. This is in the category of Luke saying the wrong person's name in bed, or being in danger of doing so.\n\nYou might want to add to your wife that you are minding your own business, too and expect the same.", "NTA\n\nWTF? Even in bad breakups there's gonna be memories of good times. There's a reason he married her and, unless she was hit in the head or something such that her personality changed, it's likely that many of the reasons he married her still exist. \n\nThere's a world of difference between fond memories and f-cking. I suggest you approach *your* wife for an explanation of why she can't see the difference. What has she experienced that tells her that fond memories indicate imminent f-cking such that she needs to try to end that relationship before it implodes.", "NTA but your wife is TA for eavesdropping, and now threatening to inform others of what she heard.", "Nobody addressing the entire \u201cmy wife had her ear to the door\u201d BS?  Cause that\u2019s some major issues right there. Also, depending on how the relationship ended, it sounds like Luke is dealing with a lack of closure - not to mention the entire toxic belief that you must hate and are not allowed to feel affection for past partners mindset. Your wife is seriously out of line from start to finish here.\n\nEdited to add - you should also give your friends the heads up on your wife\u2019s eavesdropping - I mean everyone has faults & that\u2019s okay, but they should be aware that nothing can be shared in confidence when she\u2019s around.", "NTA, your wife is a nosy AH.  And she\u2019s going to torpedo your friendship with Luke over what?  Potentially torpedo his relationship?  Luke didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to stand on this fictional moral high ground.  Luke didn\u2019t cheat, he isn\u2019t a cheater and all he did was drunkenly admit he was still dealing with feelings from his prior marriage.  There is no indication he wants to act on it.\n\nLuke went through some BS & trauma and is working it out, your wife needs to mind her own business.  There is no time limit on dealing with your spouse cheating on you.  For some people, that takes years to work through.  Right now Megan isn\u2019t a victim of anything.  What is she trying to protect her from?  The fact Luke is still dealing with trauma from his past marriage?  So your wife and others can try to shame him for a normal response?\n\nAnd the fact your wife was listening on private conversations kind of shows you what type of person she is.\n\nIf Luke had said he planned to cheat this would be different but he sounds like a normal dude processing a betrayal that deeply impacted him.  Your wife doesn\u2019t get to be a jerk and set him back on his path to recovery by torpedoing his life again and shaming him when he did nothing wrong.  \n\nI would never let my SO insert herself into my friend\u2019s relationship like this.  Your wife doesn\u2019t seem to recognize Luke is a victim and hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.  And the fact she is trying to threaten you into telling Megan is absurd & crazy disrespectful.  \n\nFirst you need to warn Luke, because your wife can\u2019t be trusted.  Then I would tell her it isn\u2019t any of our fucking business and it is their relationship, not ours.  Luke hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.

There is probably a good chance this is going to blow up.\n\nI would also tell my wife, that if this gets out you are going to tell everyone how she found out.  You are going to tell everyone the truth about your wife eavesdropping at the door.  If truth and transparency are so important, then your wife should deal with her truth.

Even when a relationship breaks down due to one betraying the other then it's perfectly normal that the betrayed part might still have feelings!\n\nLike you said yourself, Luke is aware the feelings are residual. He knows there's no going back to the relationship he thought he had with his ex, and he has no intention of cheating.\n\nYou may also wanna let the other guys know too about your wife apparently willing to eavesdrop on your talks.

Which is weird because they *are* willing to be meddling busybodies when they feel like it. I\u2019d be thrilled to be rid of these childish antics if I\u2019m honest.\n\nETA: For what it\u2019s worth, for people like OPs friends who lack this sort of life experience, I love the first man I ever loved. I always will. I do not want to date him, I don\u2019t even want to talk to him or have him in my life. I will always just have a fondness and love for him because he is a good person and it just didn\u2019t work out for a variety of reasons (including young age and immaturity). I wish him well and hope he has a happy and fulfilling life. That\u2019s a thing. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have \u201cfriends\u201d to call everyone I\u2019ve dated since we split to inform them that I\u2019m doing something wrong for not hating him I guess?", "It\u2019s one thing to care about someone who used to be in your life. It\u2019s another to have feelings so strong that you have to confide in your friend about them.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine any woman sticking around after a boyfriend told her he still had feelings for his ex.", "You dropped a friend over suspicions? Did you guys actually think of her as a friend?", "Because he still has some lingering feelings for someone he was MARRIED to?", "How does Luke sound like he has shaky morals? From the original post it seems he just has lingering feelings that he's already working through. It's perfectly normal for feelings to linger after a long relationship, especially one that ended abruptly for one of the people involved, as opposed to feelings ebbing away and then followed by a break-up.\n\nHaving thoughts and feelings doesn't mean shaky morals, it's what you actually do that matters, in my opinion", "Ijs she\u2019ll divorce you if was eavesdropping on friends conversations", "She\u2019ll do it to him", "Wrong. Just because you have Bros here defending you doesn\u2019t make it right. Your wife heard something in her own home that directly impacts the girlfriend\u2019s life and GIRL CODE demands that she tell her. Only a man would think a woman deserves to be second choice and should be grateful for it. The woman deserves a guy who worships the ground she walks on and can\u2019t live without her. You people are the type that would also defend him for cheating and cover it up. LOL this loser says he is still \u201cworking out feelings\u201d from a former girlfriend a year and a half ago???  Who would even want the wimp?", "Yeah no kidding! If anyone cheated in a relationship that isn't theirs, it really isn't their business anyways. Plus there can be so many nuances to a situation like that. But if they're going to make judgements on someone else's marriage, they should at very least give a chance to hear both sides. And to the eavesdropping wife, she was cool ostracizing a friend without even talking to her and yet she is going to go out of her way to share some information that could blow up a relationship? Weird. That being said, if this guy still has feelings for his ex, he probably should have dealt with that before starting a new relationship, so I feel sorry for the new girl. These people just sound like a nightmare. The whole lot of them. The only normal one was probably the friend they cut off.", "Am ex wife he spent years married to, not an ex girlfriend.\n\nThe fact that you just called him a wimp for having normal human emotions makes YOU the asshole.", "I agree completely, other than his feelings for his ex, I think it\u2019s normal to have feelings for certain people. Like if you have kids with someone, it\u2019s probably a good thing to always have love and affection for that person. They may no longer be your spouse/partner but they will always be the parent to your children and positive feelings for them aren\u2019t harmful. The same for meaningful relationships generally. It\u2019s good to maintain kindness. The idea that you have to viscerally hate your exes or you want them back seems like a waste of energy for me lol.", "I suppose that depends on what he was talking about when he said \"feelings\". When I hear \"I have feelings for my ex\" I think of romantic longing for that person, which can make it hard to give your all to a current partner. So while carrying feelings like that for a past love is normal, it's probably going to be detrimental if you start a new relationship before dealing with those feelings. That's all I'm saying. I definitely don't think anyone should viscerally hate their ex. That also is something that you shouldn't carry with you into a new relationship, or just in general. The guy very well may have been just drunk rambling and it meant nothing, so the nosey wife absolutely shouldn't say anything. But for the sake of new girl, I hope the guy isn't daily longing for his ex. That would suck for her."]}
