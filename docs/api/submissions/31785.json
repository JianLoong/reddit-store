My wife and our friend group go back from all meeting at college over 15 years ago. There is a group of 9 of us that all met, got married and we still make an effort to see each other and talk as often as we can.\n\nIt used to be 10 people, but our buddy Luke and his ex-wife divorced about 3 years ago. Now we don\u2019t know this for sure, but we\u2019re fairly certain that Luke\u2019s wife was cheating on him, so when we heard they were divorcing, we all cut her off. Interestingly she didn\u2019t seem to mind all that much but whatever. \n\nLuke went through a very dark period, and I don\u2019t blame him. We all supported him, and thankfully he made it through. About a year and a half ago, he met his current girlfriend, Megan. \n\nMegan is an absolute sweetheart and we all really enjoy her presence, and enjoy seeing Luke happy again. Now to the issue.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, me and the guys of the friend group met up as we were all in the same area. This involved going out and having one too many drinks, and from there we ended up out in the garage drinking more and talking late into the night. At a certain point, Luke drunkingly revealed that he still has feelings for his ex, but it isn\u2019t a big deal because he knows the relationship is over. Now I HATE cheaters, I\u2019ve been cheated on, so I point blank asked him if he would cheat. He said absolutely not, he knew that chapter was over, but still had some remaining feelings he was working though. It was a good enough answer for me.\n\nSo I went to go to the bathroom, and I walked outside to see my wife with her ear to a different door eavesdropping. Her face is white and eyes all big. That pissed me off for one. She then drags me inside and says that we need to tell Megan, and it\u2019s our duty as friends. \n\nI told her to mind her own business, and let Luke figure this out. If she tells Megan a drunken conversation (who knows if he even remembers it) and she leaves him, it will absolutely break Luke.\n\nShe agreed and I thought it was the end of it.\n\nThe next day, she said she had thought about it more, and would be telling Megan if I didn\u2019t do anything. We again had a conversation about it, and it turned into a large argument. I again told her she needs to mind her own business.

Lucky you.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you give Luke a heads up about what is about to happen, maybe he can get ahead of it. Your wife wants to tell Megan, and you can\u2019t realistically do anything to stop her. \n\nA drunken confession to a trusted group of friends that one might still have feelings for an ex is *not* an expression of a willingness or intent to cheat. Your  wife is blowing this alll out of proportion. \n\nIf I were Luke this would be the end of my friendship with your wife. And you, too, since you have an eavesdropper wife. The end, even if she decided not to blab to Megan. It would be the end, because I would never be comfortable, wondering what she might take out of context or extrapolate and cause a  shit show. And this may well lead to a splintering of the friend group, too. I am sorry. NTA", "Nta your wife was being intentionally nosy and is trying to start shit. If Luke had said he cheated that would be one thing, but the man hasn't done anything wrong at this point. Having residual feelings after a breakup is normal.\nEdited to fix typo.", "NTA, he confessed something deeply personal, in confidence, and he\u2019s working through it. Your wife needs to butt out! She\u2019s meddling in something that doesn\u2019t need to be meddled in, and will certainly cause unnecessary suffering", "NTA. Your wife is. \n\nThere is no significant revealed risk that Luke will cheat. No preemptive warning is ethically required. Indeed, Luke\u2019s resolve to work through his feelings demonstrates a healthy mental attitude and bodes well for his new relationship.\n\nYour wife acquired the information unethically. She deliberately eavesdropped on a conversation that was not meant for her and learned about an individual\u2019s inner emotions and struggles.\n\nShe\u2019s not in any way doing the right thing. Her belief that Luke might cheat is speculative at best and actually appears unfounded. This makes her a malicious busybody acting in bad faith, likely to satisfy some petty need for drama and to use the power that having possession of someone else\u2019s secret gives her.\n\nI recommend responding to her ultimatum with one of your own which carefully lays out the consequences of her ill-advised course of action.", "Wow, really not sure what your wife's motivation is for telling Megan.

He's not cheating, he's just dealing with left over feelings--that is something he needs to do--not your wife to stick finger in pie.\n\nSo going with ESH.", "Am I the only one that thinks the friend group generally sounds less than great? You all dropped a friend of over a decade (Luke\u2019s ex-wife) on his suspicion in the middle of what was obviously a difficult divorce, since he\u2019s still having a tough time. Did anyone care to hear her side? You were supposed to be her friends, no? This is unfortunately why the whole \u201cI married my high school/college sweetheart\u201d stuff gets mocked on social media - because it seems to lead directly to immaturity and a lack of understanding of the complexity of adult relationships. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong to marry that person but you should try to grow more together if possible because this behavior in adults kind of sucks. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA OP, but your wife (and sounds like many people in your friend group) missed out on some important adult lessons that it\u2019s time to learn. First and foremost, stay out of other people\u2019s relationships and be good friends who offer and care support and mean it.", "NTA.\n\nYou seem to be in an impossible situation.  I would suggest talking to Luke so he can head this all off with Megan.  Plus you can vouch for Luke that he said he would not cheat ever (and your wife might be willing to let it go as long as she feels Megan heard about it; then she might feel she did at least get her warned.)  This is not a great solution and could backfire, but it is definitely better than your wife telling Megan and turning nothing into something.", "So you dropped a friend over suspicions of cheating, but you  don't want your wife to say anything in case it implodes your friend group?\n\nOut of curiosity, what's the chances it was Luke that was the issue in the previous relationship? That he brought up suspicions of cheating so you guys wouldn't think badly of him? Did you even talk to your ex friend before ending the friendship?", "NTA. Yes, she needs to stay out of it!

I am so sorry for you.", "ESH, except Megan. Like you said, your wife is going to get you guys ostracized from the group. But Megan deserves to know that her boyfriend has unresolved feelings for his ex. He should tell her himself. He should not be in a relationship with these unresolved feelings.", "What is this!? NTA.\n\nDid Luke's ex-wife immediately start sagging in Luke's memories after the divorce? No? Then this is perfectly normal. You asked the correct question and got the correct answer. This is in the category of Luke saying the wrong person's name in bed, or being in danger of doing so.\n\nYou might want to add to your wife that you are minding your own business, too and expect the same.", "NTA\n\nWTF? Even in bad breakups there's gonna be memories of good times. There's a reason he married her and, unless she was hit in the head or something such that her personality changed, it's likely that many of the reasons he married her still exist. \n\nThere's a world of difference between fond memories and f-cking. I suggest you approach *your* wife for an explanation of why she can't see the difference. What has she experienced that tells her that fond memories indicate imminent f-cking such that she needs to try to end that relationship before it implodes.", "NTA but your wife is TA for eavesdropping, and now threatening to inform others of what she heard.", "Nobody addressing the entire \u201cmy wife had her ear to the door\u201d BS?  Cause that\u2019s some major issues right there. Also, depending on how the relationship ended, it sounds like Luke is dealing with a lack of closure - not to mention the entire toxic belief that you must hate and are not allowed to feel affection for past partners mindset. Your wife is seriously out of line from start to finish here.\n\nEdited to add - you should also give your friends the heads up on your wife\u2019s eavesdropping - I mean everyone has faults & that\u2019s okay, but they should be aware that nothing can be shared in confidence when she\u2019s around.", "NTA, your wife is a nosy AH.  And she\u2019s going to torpedo your friendship with Luke over what?  Potentially torpedo his relationship?  Luke didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to stand on this fictional moral high ground.  Luke didn\u2019t cheat, he isn\u2019t a cheater and all he did was drunkenly admit he was still dealing with feelings from his prior marriage.  There is no indication he wants to act on it.\n\nLuke went through some BS & trauma and is working it out, your wife needs to mind her own business.  There is no time limit on dealing with your spouse cheating on you.  For some people, that takes years to work through.  Right now Megan isn\u2019t a victim of anything.  What is she trying to protect her from?  The fact Luke is still dealing with trauma from his past marriage?  So your wife and others can try to shame him for a normal response?\n\nAnd the fact your wife was listening on private conversations kind of shows you what type of person she is.\n\nIf Luke had said he planned to cheat this would be different but he sounds like a normal dude processing a betrayal that deeply impacted him.  Your wife doesn\u2019t get to be a jerk and set him back on his path to recovery by torpedoing his life again and shaming him when he did nothing wrong.  \n\nI would never let my SO insert herself into my friend\u2019s relationship like this.  Your wife doesn\u2019t seem to recognize Luke is a victim and hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.  And the fact she is trying to threaten you into telling Megan is absurd & crazy disrespectful.  \n\nFirst you need to warn Luke, because your wife can\u2019t be trusted.  Then I would tell her it isn\u2019t any of our fucking business and it is their relationship, not ours.  Luke hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.

There is probably a good chance this is going to blow up.\n\nI would also tell my wife, that if this gets out you are going to tell everyone how she found out.  You are going to tell everyone the truth about your wife eavesdropping at the door.  If truth and transparency are so important, then your wife should deal with her truth.

You were out with the guys and instead of hanging out with her own friends, she decided to stay behind and try to find dirt??? Why was she eavesdropping? Why is she so set on telling a lady she barely knows about something she barely knows? I\u2019m assuming your wife doesn\u2019t have friends and spends her time stirring up drama. She didn\u2019t even wait until you all were done hanging out to say this. It happened 30 seconds before and she\u2019s ready to ruin her supposed friend\u2019s life. He was married to a woman for years, it\u2019ll take a long time for those feelings to leave. He\u2019s allowed to move on while he sorts himself out.

Even when a relationship breaks down due to one betraying the other then it's perfectly normal that the betrayed part might still have feelings!\n\nLike you said yourself, Luke is aware the feelings are residual. He knows there's no going back to the relationship he thought he had with his ex, and he has no intention of cheating.\n\nYou may also wanna let the other guys know too about your wife apparently willing to eavesdrop on your talks. Who knows how often she's done it looking for shit to stir up with, or what else she might pick up and then turn around and spill to the other wives about while taking it out of context.\n\nPeople like your wife is why it can be so fucking hard for guys to talk about feelings, because lo and behold, your wife wants to use Luke's openness and vulnerability against him because she's already convinced she's gonna be a \"hero\" for exposing something Luke is already working on dealing with because he himself knows it needs dealing with.\n\nDon't have anymore guy's nights in the garage as long as your wife behaves like this. Or if you do then remember to let your friends know in advance so lil miss drama can't screw them over like she will be screwing over Luke if she goes all \"Oh I wanted to tell you right away but hubby said no but I just /knew/ you deserved to know\".

Not only were they not interested in finding out if any of the suspicions were true (or considering whether their friends marriage and divorce was theirs to weigh in on\u2026), but they didn\u2019t think twice about dropping her like a bad habit.

I\u2019d be thrilled to be rid of these childish antics if I\u2019m honest.\n\nETA: For what it\u2019s worth, for people like OPs friends who lack this sort of life experience, I love the first man I ever loved. I always will. I do not want to date him, I don\u2019t even want to talk to him or have him in my life. I will always just have a fondness and love for him because he is a good person and it just didn\u2019t work out for a variety of reasons (including young age and immaturity).

From the original post it seems he just has lingering feelings that he's already working through. It's perfectly normal for feelings to linger after a long relationship, especially one that ended abruptly for one of the people involved, as opposed to feelings ebbing away and then followed by a break-up.\n\nHaving thoughts and feelings doesn't mean shaky morals, it's what you actually do that matters, in my opinion", "Ijs she\u2019ll divorce you if was eavesdropping on friends conversations", "She\u2019ll do it to him", "Wrong. Just because you have Bros here defending you doesn\u2019t make it right.

And to the eavesdropping wife, she was cool ostracizing a friend without even talking to her and yet she is going to go out of her way to share some information that could blow up a relationship? Weird. That being said, if this guy still has feelings for his ex, he probably should have dealt with that before starting a new relationship, so I feel sorry for the new girl.

Like if you have kids with someone, it\u2019s probably a good thing to always have love and affection for that person. They may no longer be your spouse/partner but they will always be the parent to your children and positive feelings for them aren\u2019t harmful. The same for meaningful relationships generally. It\u2019s good to maintain kindness.

When I hear \"I have feelings for my ex\" I think of romantic longing for that person, which can make it hard to give your all to a current partner. So while carrying feelings like that for a past love is normal, it's probably going to be detrimental if you start a new relationship before dealing with those feelings. That's all I'm saying. I definitely don't think anyone should viscerally hate their ex. That also is something that you shouldn't carry with you into a new relationship, or just in general.

I was just pointing out that sometimes people benefit from talking about things they're working on and that simply mentioning a thing doesn't mean the feelings attached to them are \"strong\". He brought up that something was still a work in progress, and OP didn't say anything about Luke saying he was struggling with those feelings or that it was weighing on him.\n\nWhat I gathered from the post is that Luke was married for nearly a decade (understandable that it takes time for all feelings to fade when there's a decade's worth of memories). He had it rough for about 3 years after (maybe even worked through some of the feelings but apparently hadn't quite processed all of them fully yet to the point of them being let go of). Now he's with Megan and is in a good place.\n\nAnd something I mentioned in another comment, who's to say whether Luke hasn't /already/ talked to Megan about this at some point before now? Megan likely knows about the previous relationship and the divorce, so it's not unreasonable that they've asked and Luke has talked to her about it and OP and his wife simply don't know about Megan already knowing.\n\nSo for all we know, Megan might already be aware, Luke maybe just hasn't mentioned about those lingering feelings to his friends before now, and thus OPs wife would simply be meddling in business that may already be sorted.\n\nWhich I guess would make that a total of three aspects why I think OP should tell Luke about his wife having eavesdropped on a private conversation. And also tell the rest of the guys about what his wife did\n\n1) OP should tell Luke so Luke can talk to Megan\n2) OP Should tell all the guys about his wife eavesdropping so they can decide whether they're comfortable having private talks in her vicinity\n3) OP should tell Luke because it might be Luke has already talked to Megan and that way OP can tell his wife that Megan already knows. Or maybe Megan can tell her.", "I Can see still having empathy for an ex in the sense you don\u2019t wish ill on them or would offer sympathy if they were in an accident but that\u2019s a normal feeling i think we should all have for everyone ( unless they\u2019ve hurt us).

Wife can suck for eavesdropping and it still sucks that Megan doesn't know this info.", "Yes, you justified it because he was drunk. What else could that possibly mean by saying that he said something he wouldn\u2019t normally say because he was drunk?  \n\nWhether he would\u2019ve said it while sober or not; it was obviously something that was on his mind enough that he did say it, albeit, in an inebriated state.\n\nAnd if it\u2019s on his mind that much, then it\u2019s an unhealthy situation.

She's going to wreck their relationship over nothing.", "Lol okay.", "\"What else could that possibly mean?\"?\n\nLook, read my comment again. I only said how you /might/ be overestimating things if \"him having said it while drunk\" waw the benchmark. You clarified that you meant him saying anything at all was your benchmark rather than the drunkeness. I don't think being drunk is a \"justification\" for things but it can be an /explanation/.\n\n/That's/ something it could possibly mean and is in fact what meant, and what I tried clarifying.\n\nAnd I said \"people sometimes\" say things they /might/ not say while sober.\n\nI was basically just trying to say it /may not be as deep as you're making it out to be/.\n\nThen again it /could/ be that deep. Sure.\n\nI was merely offering an alternative. You're going with \"obviously it's /serious feelings/ because him having said it this time means it's obviously on his mind a lot\".\n\nJust because such a thing may be true for you or someone else you know doesn't mean it's true for Luke and I was simply offering a different point of view\n\nFact is we don't know how often it's on his mind or how strong those feelings are, but you seem determined to think that it must be on his mind a lot and that his feelings for his ex has to be strong.\n\nIn such a situation then I can totally see that being a dealbreaker for people, including you, which is more than fair, as is your boundary to keep to keep things strictly physical if anyone you're seeing let you know they've still got full on feelings for their ex. Nothing wrong about that. And kudos to you for not having double-standards about it either. It's very refreshing how you're clearly not one of those who go \"I think this should apply to others but not to me\"\n\nI just think there's also merit in realising not everyone are wired the same way or act the same way we would. That goes both for Luke bringing up feelings to the other guys, and whether Megan might already be aware and having already made the choice to stay. Just because you might not, or the women you know might not do it, doesn't automatically mean Megan would make the same choice.\n\nPlus, I /am/ of the opinion that if Megan /isn't/ aware of Luke's feelings, however strong they may or may not be, then she deserves to know so she can deal with that however she wants. Me saying she may already know doesn't change that.\n\nLong story short, we see different possible interpretations based on the limited view we have into OPs life, and your interpretation is a situation you find unacceptable.\n\nAnd just to be extremely clear, because I realise maybe my comments so far hasn't been clear enough.\n\nI agree with you that if the wife blabs she's liable to get her and OP ostracised. I agree with you that Megan deserves to know where she stands with her boyfriend and that she should get to hear it from Luke directly. And /if/ Luke's feelings for his ex happen to be as strong as you think they are, to the point of being on his mind a lot and being full on feelings that would cause trouble, then yeah, a relationship with someone else right now ain't the best idea.\n\nMy sole point, again, is that there isn't enough actually given information here to say that Luke's feelings /are/ a worrying level of strong. And that if they're not that strong then the possibility /may/ be there that Megan is already aware that there are /some/ lingering feelings and that she is okay with it, or maybe Luke is even in therapy about it and that's what he meant by working on it?\n\nAnd again, kudos to you for your refreshing standards that \"if  I got told x I'd want to set boundaries, and if that's what's going on here than Megan be made aware so she can do the same or even get out if she wants.\"", "I read your comment again, and I still have the same Takeaway. You were saying that the alcohol may have caused him to say something that he would not have normally said. That is justifying his comment due to intoxication. Again, I have no other way interpreting it.\n\nThe next bit of your comment basically seems to be saying that everyone is different and we can\u2019t make assumptions. I agree that they\u2019re always outliers. Some people don\u2019t care if their partner has feelings for the ex. Some people don\u2019t care if they get cheated on. Some people are swingers. They\u2019re always Fringe situations. But with your logic, I don\u2019t know why you think Megan deserves to know anything. After all, for all we know, she might be totally cool with it and maybe even want him to get back together with his ex so they could have a threesome.\n\nMy point is that when you are in a serious relationship, you should not have feelings for your previous partner. And if they are strong enough that you are talking about them, then it\u2019s a problem. Having been married for 10 years, he should\u2019ve known that the OP was going to tell his wife; as most men tell their wives everything.", "I was trying to say that alcohol may be an alternative to why he mentioned the feelings as opposed to him having mentioned lingering feelings due to them being so strong that he's thinking about his ex a lot. An explanation rather than a justification.\n\nI was just saying that regardless of what's actually going on I agree with the general consensus that Megan deserves to know where her partner is at so that she can make her decisions based on that. I think Megan should be aware because communication is important for healthy relationships. I said we simply /don't/ know whether she knows or not. If she does know and is okay with it, then the matter of Luke having feelings for his ex is a non-issue. If she doesn't know she should be made aware. Simple as that. In either case OP telling Luke about what happened is for the best so Luke can tell Megan about those feelings (if she doesn't already know), or Luke might reveal Megan knows already and what way she's leaning on the issue.\n\n... but OP /didn't/ tell his wife about what Luke said. OP stepped out of the garage where the guys were talking and he found his wife with her ear pressed against another of the garage doors, eavesdropping on the conversation between the guys where Luke's feelings came up. My understanding is that /that's/ why he thinks her spilling the beans will potentially get them both in trouble. She'd have to explain how she came about this information. And if she says: by going out of her way to listen in on a private conversation she was not included in, then she runs the risk of her being accused of starting drama depending on how she goes about revealing what she knows. OP is her husband so it's not unlikely that he might end up on the outs as well if they get treated as a package deal in that instance and that seems to be why he's telling his wife to mind her own business.", "ESH. \nYou are doing what all males do. I question  your wife's motives, but she is right. In the end everyone chooses one or the other. Megan deserves to know that while her boyfriend isn't cheating,  his heart is not 100% hers. Your choice of words of she's sweet and we are happy to see LUKE happy says it all.  Megan deserves to see the full hand in play, not just half a hand.  Just tell your wife Luke means more than Megan.  Just like if anything happens to the two of you, you mean more than she does to his friends.   It will enable her to find friends outside your friend group who will be in her corner Just like you have your friends.", "NTA\n\nTell her to stfu, not her business.\n\nShe\u2019s stirring the pot for no reason.", "Tell her there are consequences to her actions including you losing respect for her.

That is not the same as cheating.", "NTA and I really feel for you.  Your wife thinks she has to \"protect\" Megan when what she needs to do is stay out of it!\n\nLuke's wife left him.  He had planned a life with her, and it takes time to get over it.  Ask your wife if she would feel she needed to report on Luke's feelings to Megan if Luke's wife had died instead of getting divorced.  Frankly, I would be very leery of anyone who said they were completely over their ex in three years.  I divorced my ex in 1973 and still have positive feelings for him now, fifty years later.  (God, I'm old!) But he couldn't control his drinking and he hit my child; I refused to live with an abusive drunk.   Do I still love him?  No, but I love the memories and time we had together before he fell into a bottle.  Your wife needs to keep her mouth shut and let Luke and Megan handle their own relationship without her input.

I've also said it in other comments on here.\n\nI've also said that the potential fallout depends on how she handles it. If she says it in their groupchat where all the people can see then that would def look worse than her telling Megan one on one in private. Her choice of phrasing can also affect things.

I just know that at 36 I\u2019ve seen enough relationships to know that human minds and hearts aren\u2019t that cut and dry- a good amount of the time.  I personally am a very hypermonogamous person. If I\u2019m with someone it\u2019s them or bust.  But I understand that I\u2019m not the average on this. \nI\u2019ll put it like this- \nMy mother has been married to my stepdad for almost thirty years.  Before that, she was married to my father for over 25. He was her high school love interest and they got married almost right after she was out of high school. Their divorce was ugly. Bad crazy shitty and he wasn\u2019t around a lot for us kids until we were almost adults ourselves.  My dad was very much largely at fault for what happened. He has since had another wife also and more kids. They both have gone so far in life that it\u2019s almost like that entire time and marriage was a whole other existence. But my mother said to me not that long ago \u201cI will always be in love with the man that I married. He became something else, and it was the right thing for things to have gone this way. But I loved that man and even if he is dead or different now, that doesn\u2019t change\u201d she deeply loves my step father and he\u2019s a good man. He raised me. He\u2019s also been married a few times before my mother. But it doesn\u2019t change anything between them that she feels this way- and it doesn\u2019t change a single thing between her and my father that she feels this way about who he was either. This guy in the post is grieving deeply so many different things. Even if he has progressed and gotten to here with a new wonderful person he loves deeply. Bad feelings tend to sit inside of us differently and they can sometimes even trick us into thinking they are lingering feelings of love, especially when we don\u2019t have a way to hate the person we \u201cknew\u201d our ex to be.", "eh, op's description of his wife faced wife with her ear against the door sounds fake as shit\n\nwhat i imagine happened is that she just happened to be around while they were talking - drunk people have no fucking idea how loud they are - and the look of surprise was the sinking feeling that your husband thinks it is totally fine to have feelings for an ex while being committed to someone else"]}
