And let\u2019s face it, most safety issues are inconvenient. \nYour mother needed to hear it from someone else that she was in the wrong.", "NTA your Mom is very lucky nothing happened to the child, that is so dangerous!", "NTA I hate when people think they know better than experts.", "NTA. Grandma really overstepped, (and of all things - safety measures), and is now trying to play victim. She brought this upon herself.", "NTA.  A child's safety trumps all the other bs.

Uncool.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother is literally ignoring instructions.  If she can't be trusted, is it any wonder why Jane doesn't trust her?", "NTA this is something my mother did with my daughter, for context my mother is a narcissist.

Your mother is very kind to have provided child care to your sister (I assume free of charge), but that does not give her license to dismiss what your sister says about how she wants her child taken care of.  If someone who was hired to take care of a child did such a thing, there would absolutely be cause for that person to be fired. And while it may seem silly to your mother, your sister has valid reasons for why she wants her daughter in a rear facing seat. It seems that your mother has very cavalier about a lot of what your sister has wanted and this was a breaking point because this poses a serious risk to her daughter. Of course your mother is not intentionally putting her granddaughter at risk, but the hubris and gall to believe she knows better is very demeaning to your sister and quite frankly proves she is not a safe person for your sister to leave her child with. \n\nWhile it\u2019s not your business, your mother called you to presumably get you to take her side. It doesn\u2019t sound as though you would have called her up to yell at her, rather your sister shared what happened and, like all human beings, you had formed an opinion. If she didn\u2019t try to involve you, she would not have known you took your sister\u2019s side. Hopefully she can let go of her ego, apologize (and your sister should apologize for yelling, but she is otherwise in the right and I get how she reacted in the moment), and earn the trust of your sister back.

Mom needs to apologize and agree to respect your sisters wishes from now on.", "NTA, and neither is your sister. Your mum doesn't have any right to her kids. I don't know about your culture but either way, she doesn't have some divine charge to be near her daughters kids. \n\nYour sister was giving your mum a privilege, you mum squandered her privilege and it is now being taken away.
