My suggestion is in the not to distant future, purchase some cameras to place around your house (interior and exterior). Don\u2019t do it right away and do not mention her mother again. Once they are up you\u2019ll be able to monitor what\u2019s going on. My guess is she\u2019s done this before and will continue. This is an invasion of your privacy. The key was for if you are locked out or in case of emergency. Her entering your house was neither. Your fianc\u00e9 should be acknowledging your feelings.", "NTA. She absolutely needs to call or text and not go into the house otherwise. You can't be always wondering if she's poking around your house.", "The only thing that matters is that YOU don\u2019t like it. This is a boundary you have now set. MIL (and fianc\u00e9) needs to respect that. If they push this issue they are the problem.

Call me first. And don't parade a bunch of your friends into my home without my knowledge. That's so rude and disrespectful! \n\nIs your fiance insane? That's a huge invasion of privacy. Those keys need to be revoked - from both sets of parents. Stick a key outside under a rock or something.", "NTA. You could just get a digital lock with a keypad.  Then you won't need spare keys and you'll never get locked out.", "Nta. Common curtsy goes a long way. That might be how their family works. But that's not just her space to make that call.", "NTA. I would ask your MIL directly what the emergency was and ask for the key back. Make it clear that you must be informed of all comings and goings. I\u2019m sorry your fiance is brushing you off but you deserve to feel secure in your own home.", "Nta.  Dh gave jnmil a key to our apartment.   I came home from work to find her sitting.   ON MY BED.  Dh refused to take back the key. When my phone bill came, she didn't have money to pay her long-distance calls.  I made dh get the key back.\n\nShe's there to snoop.

The key was given for emergencies only. Not to come and go like she owns the place.\n\nIt\u2019s rude, and I think it qualifies as wrong and creepy. Set that boundary firmly. Take back the key if you must! MIL should ask before entering your home, or have a valid reason.", "My husband\u2019s son has cameras at his shop. We\u2019re allowed to go over there to use it without asking but sometimes just to scare us he\u2019ll talk over the camera and ask what we\u2019re doing. OP should do that with MIL.

One day while I was at work DH called totally pissed off at me for going shopping.  I am totally confused.

She has a key, but you feel that's only for emergencies.  Your fianc\u00e9 on the other hand has no problem with her mother stopping by to pick something up while no one else is there.\n\nYou probably could have had a better conversation about this had you not called her mother creepy which I honestly agree with you on, but that offended your fianc\u00e9 so you should start by apologizing and then have a conversation about your boundaries.", "NAH  \nTogether with your fiance, set some ground rules about usage of the key (presuming that this has not been worked out already), and make sure all parties are aware of them.  I am presuming that this didn't happen when you lived in the apartment, so it does seem weird that it would be happening now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That way, if there is an emergency and one of your parents needs to enter the house, you can give them an emergency code for the lock. And then change the code immediately.", "NTA.  Leave the most absurdly large sex toys around the house when you're away.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your MIL\u2019s house. Any visits should be with your knowledge and agreement. You don\u2019t drop into her house when she\u2019s not there without her permission or knowledge. She needs to extend the same courtesy. That\u2019s basic manners.", "You need to have a ring doorbell so you can ask as she's entering what the emergency is.", "NTA. This is one of those two yes one no situations. You both need to be okay with it as it is your shared home or it does not fly. I\u2019d confiscate the key and either add a number lock she can have the code to (when emergency occurs) or hide the spare and let her know where if the situation arises. \n\nDefinitely communicate to your partner that she needs to handle this with her mother or you will. People need to respect boundaries and this kind of situation where one of you doesn\u2019t feel respected should be addressed before marriage. If you let it go you\u2019re setting a precedent that family can do what they want in your home & you should just deal with it.", "NTA. Change the locks. That is super rude and weird to do that.", "Damn, these comments are really hostile. You're NTA at all, but this is totally normal for a lot of families, and it might not have even occurred to MIL that she should text before stopping by. If you just tell her you're not cool with the drop-in's and you need some warning first, chances are she'll be perfectly happy to comply. I know I would be super embarrassed and apologetic if I found out that one of my normal-to-me behaviors was inappropriate to my in-laws. Blending different family cultures is just awkward sometimes. \n\nI would say N A H, but your fianc\u00e9e should have listened to your feelings instead of getting mad. So she's kind of TA there. That said, it probably would have been more productive to start this conversation with, \"I'm uncomfortable with this,\" instead of, \"Your mom is creepy.\"", "Oh no, that's not ok OP. My partner's mother likes to stop by and leave things outside for us. I hate that she's even on our driveway unannounced! NTA at all and you really need to have a sit down with your partner. She can't unilaterally give her mother permission for this. And if she won't speak to her mother, you absolutely can tell her (nicely) that you need her to stop.", "We do have cameras and that\u2019s actually how I saw. Her mom is aware that we have cameras also.", "If the camera notifies you when she enters you should contact her and ask what the emergency is that has her entering g your home, as that\u2019s the only reason for her to be there.", "You need to start having nude days at home.

I\u2019ve told her she doesn\u2019t need permission to go into my house for my kids things but she thinks it\u2019s utterly disrespectful to go into someone house without telling them. \n\nThis is a boundary your comfortable with so your partner and her mother need to respect it or she looses key privileges", "NTA. I would talk to your fiance again and state it is not okay. Maybe in the future you won't mind, but you do now, and it's your home, too. If it happens again, then the key needs to be revoked. Taking strangers to your home is a huge violation. You trust the mother-in-law, but do you know the friends, the friends' family, and their friends? Who knows who they speak with and share details of your house to.", "NTA I agree it is creepy, and if you don't put a stop to it now, it will never stop.", "This smacks a little of your fiance being told but not getting the message or forgetting", "NTA.

I'm only used to family letting themselves around the back of the house to sit on the patio furniture while they waited for us to get home.\n\nMy point is this may be normal for your partners family and that is fine but the problem here is that you are not comfortable with your MIL abusing having free unsupervised access to your home and your partner is dismissing your valid feelings on this matter.\n\nI think what you need to do is sit down with your partner and have a conversation like adults where you can ask her why she is so dismissive of your feelings amd to try and find a way for you to feel comfortable and safe in your own home.
