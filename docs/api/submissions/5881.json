She has been pretty rude to me over the years and i know she doesn't like me. Ryan has lowered contact a lot due to this, but I do suck it up sometimes because she is his mom.\n\nWe decided to invite her for a brief visit as it is the holiday season.  We are in the midst of wedding planning right now and have wedding stuff all over the house. The latest addition is this gorgeous sculpture made of white and pink roses of Cinderella's carriage (wedding is having a slight princess theme which Kate claims is cheesy)\n\nRyan and I went out to run some errands and left Kate home as she said she would cook dinner. When I got home the carriage was ruined and Kate was acting weird. She said it \"didn't matter what happened\" because she knows we are going to \"think the worst of her\" and she knows her son \"is never going to defend her\" I lost it and began crying while Ryan demanded to know what happened. Kate's boyfriend insisted it was an accident, but Kate said it didn't matter and she would pack her stuff and leave. At this point i totally thought she did it on purpose and lost it. I screamed at her and to be honest said some hurtful things about her divorce and losing her son.\n\nKate packed her stuff and went. Ryan then suggested we check out the security camera. So we did and she was spinning and fell. She had been drinking a lot of wine. In the video she immidiatley began crying and said we were never going to believe her, who would believe this was an accident after our history, and that she just ruined her relationship with her son. Her boyfriend literally said \"who cares about their stupid fucking wedding? You are bleeding\"\n\nWhen Ryan saw this he called her and tried to apologize (left a voicemail) He asked me to do the same as it was truly an accident. I said i wasn't ready to apologize as she made it all about herself and didn't even try to tell me the truth. She was willing to ruin her relationship with her son instead of trying to be honest, and she didn't correct her boyfriend when he said \"stupid fucking wedding\"\n\nRyan thinks I need to apologize and said he is disappointed in me. A couple family members are agreeing and saying Kate is the victim here.", "created_utc": 1672264200, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zxm4a8/aita_for_not_calling_mil_to_apologize_after/", "score": 1489, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In my experience this relationship with MIL will deteriorate much faster after you get married and will fast forward if you have children.  This can really strain a marriage.

Your MIL sounds very toxic, and clearly has treated you poorly in the past. You stated she has been rude to you and said your wedding theme was cheesy.

She should have just been honest and maybe even offered to pay for it or help fix it. However, I do think you should apologize to her. The footage proves it was just an accident and you admitted to saying hurtful and offensive things to her out of anger. I think you should just be the bigger person and apologize, even if she has never apologized to you before. Maybe this will soften her up and can open the door for you two to start having a relationship.. you never know. But apologize, and don't stoop low to her level. Plus, you made some very personal attacks... that doesn't make you any better than her.", "ESH. You suck for thinking you did nothing wrong when you tore a woman apart over a damn flower arrangement.

It was her fault just not on purpose. Something along the lines of 'sorry I thought the worst and I now know it was an accident' would be fine.  You and your fiance both deserve an apology from her too. Being drunk isn't a good excuse for breaking something.", "YTA. And your just being petty. Her boyfriend said who cares about a stupid wedding when compared to an INJURY. OFC your wedding shouldn\u2019t be her priority when she\u2019s bleeding. So expecting her to correct him is lunacy", "ESH. I think that being drunk is not an excuse for breaking things unless she did not want to be drunk. Legally at least she is responsible for her damage ... So personally it is not an accident nor an excuse.

I understand you have history with MIL2B, but I don't think you are telling us everything. \"Kate\" was clearly certain you would never believe her so she didn't try to explain.

If we ignore context, which it seems many people here are happy to do. This woman has been causing enough trouble for you and her son that he\u2019s chosen to go low contact. You decide to let her into your home because it\u2019s the holidays and she gets drunk and ruins something for your wedding. Why wouldn\u2019t you be pissed off?

ESH.\n\nWhat really solidified MIL as an AH to me was her refusal to explain what happened. Probably because she was drunk and not thinking clearly. \n\nBut I also don't understand all the N T A votes because OP had no reason to scream at MIL over her divorce and the loss of her son. She had the right to be upset about the damaged property but that doesn't need to escalate to a personal attack. Sounds like OP had been bottling up her feelings towards MIL for a long time.

You are a real piece of work and your future husband better be careful!!!!\n\nAlso you both knew you had security cameras the entire time, so the 1st thing you should've done was suggest looking at the cameras.

Good luck cause you\u2019re going to need it.
