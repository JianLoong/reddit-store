We didn\u2019t want to be too harsh because we assumed he was acting out because of the stress Lillie\u2019s diagnosis has put on the family. Percy was helping my husband, Mike, in the kitchen yesterday, and since his hair was longer than most boys wear it, he had it tied out of the way. Lillie came downstairs and started talking to Mike, and Percy jeered \u2018Screw off Mr. Clean\u2019. This made Lillie so upset to the point that she started crying. If this had been a one-time thing, it wouldn\u2019t have been such a big issue. Mike grabbed a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Percy\u2019s ponytail off. Percy started cursing and screaming and stormed off to his room. After Percy had calmed down a bit, I went to go talk to him, and he started complaining about how insecure he\u2019d be with short hair. He\u2019s had short hair several times and was considering cutting it again. The insecurity thing was bullshit. I told him that Lillie is way more insecure than he\u2019d be about it, and reminded her how devastating losing her hair was. She\u2019s always worried about people being mean to her, and told him he should consider the possibility that she\u2019s worried about that because her own brother makes fun of her. He argued that it\u2019s normal for siblings to make fun of each other and she looks fine so it\u2019s not a big deal. I told him, by that logic, he looks fine so Mike cutting his hair is no big deal. I reminded him that his hair grows ridiculously fast, but Lillie\u2019s hair won\u2019t grow back for several years. I told him that had it been me, I probably wouldn\u2019t have cut his hair, but that I don\u2019t think Mike was wrong for doing so. Mike offered to pay for Percy to get his hair fixed at a salon as well as any products he\u2019d need, and told him that he seriously needs to change the way he treats Lillie. Percy ended up apologizing to Lillie, but is still furious about his hair.

Yet your son\u2019s actions also raise issue and may be an indication of a deeper issue and if you can afford to, seeking family therapy to work though the complex emotions that I am sure you are all going through at the moment.

Has he ragged on Lillie prior to her getting sick? Did the dynamic of the family shift after she got sick? Was he not getting attention prior to Lillie getting sick? Is he perhaps jealous of Lillie getting more attention NOW, when perhaps she was getting more attention before? Did he ever have to change or cancel his plans to babysit or take care of Lillie (which if happened frequently is technically child abuse, as it falls under an Adverse Childhood Experience).

Not only is cutting hair as a form of punishment classified as child abuse, it\u2019s legally classified as assault! Meaning, if your son found out that information, he would be well within his rights to press charges! Second, why is his first reaction to cut his hair to begin with? That\u2019s not really a good sign that something so extreme and aggressive is his first move.

If she's really upset about her hair, there are some lovely charities that set up kids with real hair wigs, and I mean GOOD ones! Look them up, see if there are any in your area.

All three of you are major assholes. This is not an ESH for me. I kept waiting to read about the punishments you have tried and not one word about that except you didn't want to be too harsh...to someone making fun relentlessly of your sick child. Your other kid is 17, almost an adult and he is already an asshole. Hope your sick child is okay and does not turn out to be an asshole.", "Both you and Mike are TA for two reasons. First, you might wanna check up on the definition of assault and battery. Cutting someone's hair without permission, even if it is your kid, falls under this and could land your butt in serious trouble. \n\nSecond, I don't care what Percy did. Mike had NO right to even use cutting his hair as punishment. As that sort of thing is just stupid and doesn't teach an appropriate lesson. Percy won't learn to treat his sister better. He's only learned that it's okay to humiliate someone if they don't do what others want.\n\nSo screw the hair products and the salon. Mike owes Percy an apology and a promise that he'll NEVER do it again. In short, be an adult who can admit when he went too far.\n\nAs for Percy, don't think I wouldn't have something to say about him as well. Like you, he is TA. He needs a major reality check and some lessons in empathy. How he's treating his sister is horrible and will have lasting consequences' on her. Percy needs to realize this and not just chalk his behavior up to mere teasing.\n\nBut then again, what else can be expected? With what Mike did and how you condoned his actions, it's no wonder Percy acts the way he does. He picked it up from you two, even if you fail to see it. So before you condemn the kid, consider your own actions first.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, but your husband straight up assaulted your son. Your son deserved to be punished, but that is not the right way to go about it.", "YTA. Both you and your husband are. I understand what your son did isn\u2019t nice to his sister by any means. Especially over something as serious as cancer. But you traumatizing your son more when he\u2019s probably thinking about how he could potentially lose his little sister is not helping. Rather than thinking about WHY your son may be acting out, you worsened the situation. Also, with Mike going to the extreme by impulsively chopping off his son\u2019s hair, it makes me wonder what type of upbringing he had that could maybe have resulted in him acting out further. Since, ya know\u2026it\u2019s assault and can be classified as child abuse. Another thing to consider here besides the stress is how he feels which he may not be telling you. Be better", "YTA. That was assault. So instead of dealing with your damn-near-adult son's bullying your sick 8 year old daughter, you let it go, failed to protect your daughter from bullying in her own home, and then went from zero to 100 by Mike assaulting him, and you condoning it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Percy is also an asshole. But he's a kid whose parents apparently don't bother to even discipline him for picking on a sick 8 year old until they assault him, so you're pretty much too blame for that, too.\n\nGreat parenting.

That's assault and he had no right to put his hands on your son, but I understand the frustration. You both need to sit down with your son and have a serious talk with him. I'm guessing that maybe he's making fun of her, because he's worried about her, doesn't want to show it and doesn't know how to verbalize his feelings properly. He shouldn't be let off the hook for picking on her little girl. Of course not.\n\nBottom line..your husband should apologize for assaulting your son. Your son who did apologize to his little sister, should also come to realize that there are more important things in life, than a pony tail, that does grow back and should get an attitude adjustment and right quick.\n\nHonestly, I feel horrible for all of you, because you're in a situation where nothing feels normal to you at the moment.

All because it is tough on HIM?Then suddenly out of nowhere your husband assaults your son. You and your husband have both failed as parents.", "NTA. Percy was being a jerk He\u2019s the AH.", "Percy is 17!! What is wrong with him to treat his little sister like this? This is not the usual sibling rivalry and to me it seems there's more going on. Perhaps it would be good for you all to go into therapy.", "He mocked a child with cancer when he\u2019s almost a legal adult so I have no remorse for Percy. NTA", "NTA... except for being so laid back in your approach to this. He's WAYYYYYYYY too old to be picking on healthy 8 year olds, much less his little sister with cancer. If he can't behave, I'd say that for Lilly's sake maybe he needs to go stay with another family member until after some pretty hard-core therapeutic interventions, and that goes triple with the context of her illness", "NTA at all. Your 8 yr is going through so much. Regardless of what it would have been. This isn\u2019t the time to be \u201cpicking on siblings\u201d this is the time to concrete happy memories. The 8 yr is going through something so traumatic. Idk if this just speaks to much to me but niece had neuroblastoma for only 7 months before she passed. She didn\u2019t even make it to 3 but she made it more than clear when things/people had really bothered her to the extent of no longer wanting to be around them. Your oldest was more than aware to know what they were saying. I understand being frustrated believe me. I (18 at the time) raised my other niece and nephew the time my sister was in hospital with her youngest(college and work balanced between) and even then I can admit family feuds came about. Yet we never took it to far because we knew the center of our issues/ stress. We didn\u2019t want to stress her more. We didn\u2019t want to make such heat during an already stressful time. We just wanted her to be happy as much as she possibly could be. This is not the time to make it about themselves. This is the time to focus on what\u2019s really going on.\n Edit to say I am so sorry you\u2019re going through any of this. No parent deserves this. No child does. I wish nothing but the best for you little one and family. If you need to talk ever pls DM me.", "NTA he deserved that and more. I would have shaved a piece of hair, your son is a fucking asshole for making fun of her 8 year old sister who has cancer.", "NTA.  Your sil is a lunatic.  What are you supposed to do at this point, buy Mike a wig?  Mike an asshole for being a 17-year old who teases a child about her physical appearance.", "JFC you wonder why your kid acts terribly when this is the example of parenting he has at home. Your husband (your son\u2019s stepdad I\u2019m assuming as you never once said \u2018our son\u2019 or \u2018his dad\u2019) **literally assaulted and battered your minor child using a sharp implement as a punishment**. How many other inappropriate and abusive punishments happen in your household that you endorse?\n\nChildren can only learn from the examples they\u2019ve been given. It doesn\u2019t sound like your son has a kind and understanding parental figure in his life. He has Mike, who flies off the handle in inappropriate ways, and he has you, who just stand by passively and let things happen around you. This is not an appropriate way to deal with bullying, or sibling jealousy, or even a stranger harassing you in the street. It is definitely not an appropriate way for an adult to punish a child.\n\nIf you were upset at Mike for his behaviour I\u2019d give you an E-S-H. But you don\u2019t seem to think there\u2019s anything wrong with it, so you get a YTA.\n\nPercy needs therapy. Mike needs anger management and therapy. You need parenting classes.", "Normally I say that an A H move but the moment you start picking on a kid ten years younger than you... let alone one who has cancer and must be terrified well you get what you deserve. Frankly I feel your husband offering to pay was too generous.\n\nWhat I will say is that you dont seem to be addressing the bigger issue and thats the attitude your 17 yo has. It might be the stress, might be his own fears over whats happening but the way hes acting, esp. At his age, isnt healthy. You need to get him communicating in a healthy way ASAP, and you need to ensure that your son isnt feeling/neglected because your attention is focused on your daughter.\n\nI hope your daughter makes a full and speedy recovery.", "Yep. There is an exception to every rule. Bullying sick or handicapped kids is the #1 exception in my world.  Violate that rule, and imwill exception your ass. Mike nta. percy was.", ">BUT I think...........\n\nSansa Stark: They respect you, they really do, but you have to... Why are you laughing?\r  \n\r  \nJon Snow: What did father use to say? Everything before the word \"but\" is horse shit.", "Yeah I honestly never thought there would be an exception, but we found it.", "Does it not seem kind of out of line for a parent to do this to their kid, even if the kid is an asshole? I'm thinking ESH.", "Here\u2019s another question, if he\u2019s that much of an asshole to sick family what is he like to other kids through the years at school?", "Fr, first thing I thought was that conversation she had needed to happen WAY before & it sounds like the first time they\u2019ve told him that.", "Definitely agree but I also can\u2019t help wondering if the daughter and husband are Perceys step family. Doesn\u2019t make anything he did justifiable but I\u2019m wondering what sort of dynamic is going on in this home??? That\u2019s very strange for a 17 year old to mock his sister when she has flippen cancer", "We had punished him by taking his phone, video games, etc. Probably should\u2019ve included that, sorry about that", "I think it's really really wrong here to be focused on a ponytail getting cut off and not an almost adult bullying a child with cancer.", "ESH except for poor Lillie.\n\nYou have a 17 year old gleefully bullying a child with cancer *for* having cancer.\n\nAn adult who assaulted that bully who is a minor.\n\nAnd OP who did not thing to stop any of this.", "I very much agree with you. \n\nCutting off a 17 y/o ponytail is, I would imagine, not just one surprise \\*snip\\* unless everything were just so (and that still would be bad, of course). I would *guess* this looked more like an altercation than a haircut, and that is very scary when it comes to sharp objects and trusted adults.", "He\u2019s 17 and pretty awful even by the standards of 17 year olds. He deserved it.", "That is so inappropriate!\n\nJust a landing strip down the middle \ud83d\ude27", "\u261d\ud83c\udffb", "You also have to think about the dynamic shift in who's being looked after more, your daughter or your son.  It's something that families with medical issues fail to consider seeking an outside therapist to deal with the emotional state of things that affect the entire family.  Also for your husband's sake, he needs assistance in working on his anger issues because that could be viewed as assault which your son could make an outside case for and make things 100 times worse.", "It's really hard for me to envision a situation in which a 17 year old would act out like this in this specific situation without there being other stuff going on. It's possible because teenagers are hard to pin down, but I don't see it as likely.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Also he\u2019s a teenager, he\u2019s gonna be a dick and if he has bad parents then it\u2019s just going to amplify it", "I\u2019d argue that ESH because seventeen is definitely old enough to know that bullying an eight year old cancer patient is wrong. They\u2019re definitely AH parents, but they\u2019ve also raised an AH kid. I feel awful for Lillie.", "Fuck no, especially considering the context. What was this child\u2019s crime??? Coming downstairs and talking to her dad???? For her brother to say something so awful and so unprovoked deserves this", "Nope, he deserved it. He's 17, ffs. He should have known better than to bully a young kid, let alone one suffering from cancer. Plus the parents warned him already to stop the behaviour. \n\nSiblings teasing is a different thing, harmless teasing, pranks etc are okay but bullying is a huge no-no!", "Or before she had cancer", "How does any of that teach him how to behave? How does any of that build empathy? How does any of that address what is going so wrong in his head that he is bringing anyone else down, let alone someone with cancer?\n\nHow have you let this go on without working on the underlying issue?!\n\nIf you think this is stress, then why haven\u2019t you worked with him on proper coping strategies or had him work with a therapist?\n\nThis screams shitty parenting, honestly.\n\nYes, he is hands down an AH. No questions about it. Nothing in hurting another person intentionally is funny, and he knows it bothers her and knows it hurts her so if he does it, it is intentional. That\u2019s fucked op.", "Your family needs therapy. Your husband for his weird reaction, he isn't fit to parent. Your daughter for her struggles with her body image caused by your family. Your son for his lack of empathy. You for allowing this to go on for so long. What the fuck man. Your son is an omega asshole but either he was raised that way or he has a personality disorder, and this needs to be watched closely.", "I was wavering between ESH (excluding L) and YTA but I\u2019m going YTA. I\u2019ll probably get down voted to hell but here\u2019s why:\n\nPercy was being a bully. And unfortunately the only way to get bullies to stop usually is to give them a taste of their own medicine. \n\nBut I think YTA because YOU didn\u2019t do anything to stop this before it got to this point. Your punishments were clearly insufficient. Percy is old enough to know better, but you kept making excuses for him even though it was a repeat offense until this all bubbled over. You and Mike are a team. You shouldn\u2019t have told Percy \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have, but it\u2019s not wrong.\u201d Your response should have been, \u201cplay stupid games, win stupid prizes.\u201d, Continuing to whine about his hair means he doesn\u2019t really get it.", "I don\u2019t know, OP.  I think you owe your husband owes your son an apology. Your son is 17 years old, is this really the type of thing you want to do when he\u2019s almost 18 and able to walk out of your life?\n\nMaybe he needs therapy or family therapy?", "I hope your son files a police report for the assault from your husband \u2026", "Preach.", "Both can be and are incorrect behaviors.", "That's what ESH is for. I'm not tryna decide which thing is worse. I don't need to. The brother definitely shouldn'ta done what he did (and yeah I do think that's probably worse) but the parents were wrong af too. In this scenario, everyone but the youngest kiddo didn't ac right and therefore all of them are AH", "He is being awful, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay what his father did. It\u2019s a breach of consent and it\u2019s not how you handle the situation as an adult or as an parent.", "Very on point comment, hope OP sees it", "Bullying a child for having cancer does not fall under the realm of normal teenage dickish behaviour. I was a teen not too long ago and neither I nor anyone I knew in my age group would have ever done what Percy did.", "Exactly! Emotionally immature parents.", "Honestly totally agree kid sucks too but I just was fucking appalled at the parents joke of a parenting technique that I just said YTA and I really don't feel like changing it.\n\nAnd I don't mean that last part in a bitchy or passive aggressive way. I'm not changing my ruling mainly because a kid shouldn't have that kind of thing forced on their bodily autonomy.", "Yeah he\u2019s their kid, but so is Lillie. It must have been really hard to not only have to deal with her cancer diagnosis and all that entails, but having their own son behaving so cruelly on top of it all...Now they have to devote energy to this of all things? This has been going on for weeks. I can\u2019t even imagine what Mike was feeling in the moment. Percy is the only AH here.", "How about the fact that the parents have watched him treat her like shit for a while now and not effectively managed it?", "I think a strong emotional reaction to an almost adult bullying his child with cancer is probably warranted. You're not a bad parent because you lose it over something horrible like that.", "If OP\u2019s son is insecure about short hair, how insecure do you think his daughter is about having no hair? It sounds like he didn\u2019t even seemed phased about bringing her to tears. OP mentioned they already tried the normal ways of disciplining him, but to no avail. he is basically an adult, and he is going out of his way to make his 8 y/o sister with cancer cry. That\u2019s sick. now Percy at least has a SLIGHT idea of how his sister feels about her hair loss. He definitely needs therapy, but he needs to stop bullying his horribly ill kid sister first. She has a lot more to worry about than him. Play stupid kids, when stupid prizes. NTA, fuck Percy dry with a splintery wooden dildo. I really hope this is fake", "Nope. Son owes lily an apology and one to mike.  Yes, to mike. For complaining about justice that was servd upon him.", "Agree. But the comment I'm responding to literally has two sentences about how it's not nice to pick on kids with cancer and THREE PARAGRAPHS about it being wrong to cut off a ponytail. That's fucked up to me.", "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf I guess two wrongs make a right around here? \n\nSeriously two things can be gross at once even if you think one is grosser.", "Yeah, that\u2019s some real *We Need to Talk About Kevin* vibes\u2026", "I never said it was normal dickish behavior. What I was saying was teenagers who are normally already assholes can be 10x worse when placed in a toxic parenting environment. For example, if the parents just casually bully their own children, the child in that environment will either a.) be more emotional and anxious or b.) become more aggressive. There are obviously more outcomes but it\u2019s basic psychology. I never said it was okay. And I would never condone such a thing. But if you read my comment correctly, you\u2019d see I was agreeing with the commenter and adding onto the fact that bad parenting will make a child worse.", "Totally agree, punishment was insane - and is technically assault, right? They\u2019re horrible parents who created a horrible kid, who\u2019s now aging into being a horrible adult. The cycle continues.", "It\u2019s pretty obvious it\u2019s wrong to insult a kid with cancer, but the fact that it\u2019s also wrong to cut the hair is being ignored so that\u2019s probably why it was the focus.", "The question is literally about the ponytail.", "Fr. There\u2019s not an ounce of empathy there. Well, at least from what we can see from the post. It really makes you wonder what else has happened that caused him to act like this and think it\u2019s okay?", "Well I think its been counted as assault when Native/ Indigenous/minority kids have had their hair forcibly cut or radically changed without consent so I'd say absolutely.", "Still fucked up to me.", "At least now he has a slight understanding of what his sister is going through. Hopefully he gets made fun of for it too"]}
