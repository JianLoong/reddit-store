We didn\u2019t want to be too harsh because we assumed he was acting out because of the stress Lillie\u2019s diagnosis has put on the family. Percy was helping my husband, Mike, in the kitchen yesterday, and since his hair was longer than most boys wear it, he had it tied out of the way. Lillie came downstairs and started talking to Mike, and Percy jeered \u2018Screw off Mr. Clean\u2019. This made Lillie so upset to the point that she started crying. If this had been a one-time thing, it wouldn\u2019t have been such a big issue. Mike grabbed a pair of kitchen scissors and cut Percy\u2019s ponytail off. Percy started cursing and screaming and stormed off to his room. After Percy had calmed down a bit, I went to go talk to him, and he started complaining about how insecure he\u2019d be with short hair. He\u2019s had short hair several times and was considering cutting it again. The insecurity thing was bullshit. I told him that Lillie is way more insecure than he\u2019d be about it, and reminded her how devastating losing her hair was. She\u2019s always worried about people being mean to her, and told him he should consider the possibility that she\u2019s worried about that because her own brother makes fun of her. He argued that it\u2019s normal for siblings to make fun of each other and she looks fine so it\u2019s not a big deal. I told him, by that logic, he looks fine so Mike cutting his hair is no big deal. I reminded him that his hair grows ridiculously fast, but Lillie\u2019s hair won\u2019t grow back for several years. I told him that had it been me, I probably wouldn\u2019t have cut his hair, but that I don\u2019t think Mike was wrong for doing so. Mike offered to pay for Percy to get his hair fixed at a salon as well as any products he\u2019d need, and told him that he seriously needs to change the way he treats Lillie. Percy ended up apologizing to Lillie, but is still furious about his hair.

However, the punishment being to cut his hair seems too far and it can put you in a difficult place as a parent.

Yet your son\u2019s actions also raise issue and may be an indication of a deeper issue and if you can afford to, seeking family therapy to work though the complex emotions that I am sure you are all going through at the moment.

Has he ragged on Lillie prior to her getting sick? Did the dynamic of the family shift after she got sick? Was he not getting attention prior to Lillie getting sick? Is he perhaps jealous of Lillie getting more attention NOW, when perhaps she was getting more attention before? Did he ever have to change or cancel his plans to babysit or take care of Lillie (which if happened frequently is technically child abuse, as it falls under an Adverse Childhood Experience).

If she's really upset about her hair, there are some lovely charities that set up kids with real hair wigs, and I mean GOOD ones! Look them up, see if there are any in your area.

I kept waiting to read about the punishments you have tried and not one word about that except you didn't want to be too harsh...to someone making fun relentlessly of your sick child.

Hope your sick child is okay and does not turn out to be an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Made the judgement clearer.", "Both you and Mike are TA for two reasons. First, you might wanna check up on the definition of assault and battery. Cutting someone's hair without permission, even if it is your kid, falls under this and could land your butt in serious trouble. \n\nSecond, I don't care what Percy did. Mike had NO right to even use cutting his hair as punishment. As that sort of thing is just stupid and doesn't teach an appropriate lesson. Percy won't learn to treat his sister better. He's only learned that it's okay to humiliate someone if they don't do what others want.\n\nSo screw the hair products and the salon. Mike owes Percy an apology and a promise that he'll NEVER do it again. In short, be an adult who can admit when he went too far.\n\nAs for Percy, don't think I wouldn't have something to say about him as well. Like you, he is TA. He needs a major reality check and some lessons in empathy. How he's treating his sister is horrible and will have lasting consequences' on her. Percy needs to realize this and not just chalk his behavior up to mere teasing.\n\nBut then again, what else can be expected? With what Mike did and how you condoned his actions, it's no wonder Percy acts the way he does. He picked it up from you two, even if you fail to see it. So before you condemn the kid, consider your own actions first.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, but your husband straight up assaulted your son. Your son deserved to be punished, but that is not the right way to go about it.", "YTA. Both you and your husband are. I understand what your son did isn\u2019t nice to his sister by any means. Especially over something as serious as cancer. But you traumatizing your son more when he\u2019s probably thinking about how he could potentially lose his little sister is not helping. Rather than thinking about WHY your son may be acting out, you worsened the situation. Also, with Mike going to the extreme by impulsively chopping off his son\u2019s hair, it makes me wonder what type of upbringing he had that could maybe have resulted in him acting out further. Since, ya know\u2026it\u2019s assault and can be classified as child abuse. Another thing to consider here besides the stress is how he feels which he may not be telling you. Be better", "YTA. That was assault. So instead of dealing with your damn-near-adult son's bullying your sick 8 year old daughter, you let it go, failed to protect your daughter from bullying in her own home, and then went from zero to 100 by Mike assaulting him, and you condoning it.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Percy is also an asshole. But he's a kid whose parents apparently don't bother to even discipline him for picking on a sick 8 year old until they assault him, so you're pretty much too blame for that, too.\n\nGreat parenting.

That's assault and he had no right to put his hands on your son, but I understand the frustration. You both need to sit down with your son and have a serious talk with him.

He shouldn't be let off the hook for picking on her little girl. Of course not.\n\nBottom line..your husband should apologize for assaulting your son. Your son who did apologize to his little sister, should also come to realize that there are more important things in life, than a pony tail, that does grow back and should get an attitude adjustment and right quick.\n\nHonestly, I feel horrible for all of you, because you're in a situation where nothing feels normal to you at the moment.
