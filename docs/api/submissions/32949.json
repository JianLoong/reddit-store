It wasn't a funny happy day because of sister's MIL. The whole pregnancy hadn't been a good time because she's had to be the center of attention. She was always saying \"My baby\" and at the gender reveal, she was front and center hollering ITS A BOY!!! While jumping up and down waving her arms infront of everyone. You could tell it really bothered my sister.\n\nThe day my nephew was born, my sister said that she only wanted our mom and her husband in the room with her during the birth. His mom came unglued saying if she couldn't be in there then our mom couldn't be either. My sisters blood pressure was dangerously the whole day because of her. The handful of us in the waiting room basically had to keep her corralled the whole time. Any time there were any updates, she would make sure to be the first in line to hear it. We were all tired of her by the time the baby came. I get that she was excited to be a grandma but we all thought she needed to tone it down a big notch.\n\nShe had to be first in the room and literally butted me out of the way to see him when they brought him back from cleaning him up and when the nurse asked who wanted to hold him first (asking my sis or BIL) she butted in ME!! And tried to take him from the nurse. Someone had to grab her and tell her to calm down. You could hear my sisters moniters beeping fast. I'd personally had enough and pulled BIL aside and said that he needed to get his mom under control because we're about to go off on her.\n\nHe didn't take that well and we all ended up being kicked out of the room and of course his mom was throwing a tantrum because of it. I just went home. Now BIL is mad at me and saying I am the one that is stressing my sister out. I don't know what to do in this situation. He can plainly see what his mom is doing and can see how angry his wife is but he does nothing but gets mad when someone else says something. AITA for being the one to speak up? Was it the wrong time to do so?", "created_utc": 1702487427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hlnd1/aita_for_saying_something_to_my_bil_about_his_mom/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your BIL needs to get his mom in check. She is going to try and control other aspects of their relationship. Has the mom always been like this or only after your sister got pregnant?", "NTA, your sister has a husband problem as well as a mil problem. You stuck up for your sister cause her husband wouldn't. How's your sister? Has she had a conversation with her husband about this?", "Yeah, you just saw what everyone else did.  A glimpse of the horror show that is going to be your sister's life.\n\nWhile commendable that you had the decency to try and defend your sister in her vulnerable state, this isn't a cause you can champion.  While you had proof they'd cut the cord on your nephew, it sounds like BiL is still strongly attached to his.\n\nYour sister is in for an uphill battle with overreaching Gramma.  Keep in contact with her, not so much her husband, and offer her the support emotionally she's going to need while she deals with this.  Worst case scenario, start looking for an escape plan if she mentions doubts about the marriage.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nNTA", "NTA. These kind of situations make me so uncomfortable. Your sister is incredibly vulnerable right now, probably the most vulnerable she'll ever be. BIL should be making her (and their baby) the priority, not his freaking mother.", "NTA.  \n\nBut the thing is in a hospital, the staff has to power to remove and keep unwanted visitors away.  The only people with real power here were your sister and Bil, and it was their jobs to tell the nurse Smil can't be in here.  I'm surprised your sister didn't ask for it, unless she feels like she can't because of an overattached husband.\n\nSmil is Major, screaming, over-attached-grandmazilla AH, and frankly your bil is an AH too... yeah, if she's upsetting your sister that much, 100% he should be doing or saying something.  But given his mom's behavior, I wouldn't be surprised if either he's worried about standing up to her, or they're so enmeshed he doesn't see an issue.", "This is something your sister and BIL need to fix, not you.  However, in the heat of the moment, while your sister is laying in a hospital bed, I think NTA is appropriate for you to stand up for her.  Talk to your sister and explain what happened.  It's clear BIL will side with MIL, so your sister will have to fight that fight.\n\nPoint sister to r/justnomil for similar stories about babies rabies MIL and how to put them in their place.", "NTA.  He knew EXACTLY what was happening.  This wasn't a surprise to him.  *He's looking for someone to blame other than his Mom.*  **You're it.**  Don't back down, though, because you know what the truth is.  So does he.  So does your sister.  She's going to need people to back her up against MIL, especially if BIL isn't going to do it.", "NTA. You were looking out for your sister. Point your sister towards r/JUSTNOMIL I think she would really benefit from that subreddit.", "NTA but your sister's husband is going to need to stand up to his mom and support his wife or else this marriage will not last. Maybe someone should tell him THAT.", "NTA all I can say is your mom is a saint! If that been my daughter I would have went to jail.\nMil would have been tossed out on her ass by me!", "NTA, but obviously, it made things worse.  In a normal dynamic, BIL would have appreciated the backup.  But it is both BIL and his mom that are the issue.  This is not good for your sis.\n\nThe writing is on the wall, the MIL is going to get your sis out of their hair asap. By fair means or foul.   SHE TRIED TO HOLD THE BABY BEFORE EITHER OF THE PARENTS.  That's not excited, that is freaking nutso. \n\nTo support your sis, you will likley need to suck it up and be a pushover, or there is a possibility no one from your family will have access. Not just you, all of you. And sis is going to need a LOT of support, because her spouse looks like all he wants to do is please his mommy.  I would be super concerned about the coming month, and would walk on eggshells to be able to have youor at least your mom support her post-partum. Even if it meant sucking up to devil MIL herself just so your mom could be reliable in contact.", "Are you BIL blind? Why can't he see how problematic his mother is?", "NTA you were trying to protect your sister the way her husband should have been", "YTA\n\nYou trampled on your BIL on a super, super important day for him and his Wife; treated him like another guest in the room. You were the guest, not him. Your Sister and BIL can handle their own business without your input.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you did the right thing by sticking up for her and hopefully she tells your brother-in-law that it's not you stressing her out.", "NTA. \n\nYour BIL should have put his foot down a long time before the baby arrived. Having a baby is not a spectator sport. Your sister went through a *medical procedure* that could have become life-threatening, and even if everything went smoothly, she was still in an extremely vulnerable state. Your BIL is welcome to invite your parents for his next colonoscopy or prostate exam if he\u2019s cool with that kind of intimacy with his in-laws, but your sister gets to call the shots on who is or isn\u2019t present when it\u2019s her procedure. BIL\u2019s mom trying to hold the baby before your sister or BIL is majorly unhinged as well. At least someone stepped up to advocate for your sister.", "Woah.    Let\u2019s all calm down. The MIL is a loon and was being appropriately managed by the staff at the hospital and by the family during the time in the waiting room. Acting aggressive to BIL only creates more drama and stress for new mom and was unnecessary- assuming OP is not a loon he had the capacity to choose better behavior.  Let this go let your sister manage her own life and don\u2019t add to her problems ahead will ask for your help if she wants it.  ESH", "NTA, your poor sister. She married her MIL too. You should start taking bets on how fast BIL will move his mom into his home to \u201cwatch the baby\u201d.", "From what I can tell, she's always been in a word eccentric. BIL is a mommas boy. We can all tell he is. It just really ramped up after the pregnancy announcement.", "They're home is about all I can say right now. I don't know if they've talked about it. I'm kinda staying away to let it hopefully calm down before I ask to come see them. We tried calling to talk about it but all that was said by BIL was he is mad at me for saying what I did.", "To be honest, we weren't happy when she said they were getting married and not exactly overjoyed when she told us she was pregnant. I'm happy for her yes because she's a mother and I have a nephew but the all around feeling was 'really? You actually want to be with him?' But we knew to not actually come out and say that. You just get an annoying bothersome vibe off of him. His mom too.", "He was also a guest in OP\u2019s sister\u2019s hospital room. He was not the patient, therefore, he is included in the list of GUESTS at his wife\u2019s bedside.", "To be honest, i think you should talk with your sister about MIL\u2019s attitude, don\u2019t try to force any actions but warn and encourage her to put sume boundaries and communicate with her husband about her attitude. At this rate her MIL will come to visit unannounced, take the baby away from quality time, criticize her every action as a parent which can severely affect her mental health.\n\nIt all depends on your sister, people like her MIL wont stop until both (sister and her husband) set some boundaries.", "From the context you have provided it sounds like he values his mother more than his wife. He wants to make sure she is comfortable rather than his wife who just gave birth. Good on you for standing up for your sister.", "Your bil is an ah. He let this behaviour happen and could see how your sister was. Be careful with this as your BIL could use this as a reason to ban you from their home.", "Ditto. NTA. That woman is unhinged and going to be a problem more than ever with a grandchild."]}
