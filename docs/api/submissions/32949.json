It wasn't a funny happy day because of sister's MIL. The whole pregnancy hadn't been a good time because she's had to be the center of attention. She was always saying \"My baby\" and at the gender reveal, she was front and center hollering ITS A BOY!!! While jumping up and down waving her arms infront of everyone. You could tell it really bothered my sister.\n\nThe day my nephew was born, my sister said that she only wanted our mom and her husband in the room with her during the birth. His mom came unglued saying if she couldn't be in there then our mom couldn't be either. My sisters blood pressure was dangerously the whole day because of her. The handful of us in the waiting room basically had to keep her corralled the whole time. Any time there were any updates, she would make sure to be the first in line to hear it. We were all tired of her by the time the baby came. I get that she was excited to be a grandma but we all thought she needed to tone it down a big notch.\n\nShe had to be first in the room and literally butted me out of the way to see him when they brought him back from cleaning him up and when the nurse asked who wanted to hold him first (asking my sis or BIL) she butted in ME!! And tried to take him from the nurse. Someone had to grab her and tell her to calm down. You could hear my sisters moniters beeping fast. I'd personally had enough and pulled BIL aside and said that he needed to get his mom under control because we're about to go off on her.\n\nHe didn't take that well and we all ended up being kicked out of the room and of course his mom was throwing a tantrum because of it. I just went home. Now BIL is mad at me and saying I am the one that is stressing my sister out. I don't know what to do in this situation. He can plainly see what his mom is doing and can see how angry his wife is but he does nothing but gets mad when someone else says something. AITA for being the one to speak up? Was it the wrong time to do so? \n\nEDIT: my mother and BIL were the only ones back there with my sister during the birth. Everyone else was in the waiting room. Myself included. His mom rarely sat down and would go peek in the window of the door every now and then to see if anyone was coming with any updates and we'd have to tell her to come sit down and be patient.", "created_utc": 1702487427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18hlnd1/aita_for_saying_something_to_my_bil_about_his_mom/", "score": 1000, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think you did the right thing by sticking up for her and hopefully she tells your brother-in-law that it's not you stressing her out.", "NTA. \n\nYour BIL should have put his foot down a long time before the baby arrived. Having a baby is not a spectator sport. Your sister went through a *medical procedure* that could have become life-threatening, and even if everything went smoothly, she was still in an extremely vulnerable state. Your BIL is welcome to invite your parents for his next colonoscopy or prostate exam if he\u2019s cool with that kind of intimacy with his in-laws, but your sister gets to call the shots on who is or isn\u2019t present when it\u2019s her procedure. BIL\u2019s mom trying to hold the baby before your sister or BIL is majorly unhinged as well. At least someone stepped up to advocate for your sister.", "Woah.    Let\u2019s all calm down. The MIL is a loon and was being appropriately managed by the staff at the hospital and by the family during the time in the waiting room.

I'm kinda staying away to let it hopefully calm down before I ask to come see them. We tried calling to talk about it but all that was said by BIL was he is mad at me for saying what I did.", "To be honest, we weren't happy when she said they were getting married and not exactly overjoyed when she told us she was pregnant. I'm happy for her yes because she's a mother and I have a nephew but the all around feeling was 'really? You actually want to be with him?' But we knew to not actually come out and say that.

At this rate her MIL will come to visit unannounced, take the baby away from quality time, criticize her every action as a parent which can severely affect her mental health.\n\nIt all depends on your sister, people like her MIL wont stop until both (sister and her husband) set some boundaries.", "From the context you have provided it sounds like he values his mother more than his wife. He wants to make sure she is comfortable rather than his wife who just gave birth. Good on you for standing up for your sister.", "Your bil is an ah.

It was his job to make sure this birth was as comfortable as possible for his wife and he failed to protect her. His first job as a father and he failed miserably. \n\nYour sister was entitled to decide who was there for the birth. Not your MIL dictating. She needs putting in her box. He won't do it.

I\u2019m just going to guide you over to r/justnomil and maybe you can also guide your sister to that subreddit as well. Do what you can to support your sister because if her husband\u2019s lack of support during her most vulnerable time is any indication of their future together, she\u2019s going to need as many people as possible behind her. His behavior does NOT bode well for their marriage. Sorry but he didn\u2019t care that his wife\u2019s blood pressure was higher whenever his mother was around.

These things can take ages - days, even (unless it was a planned cesarian?) No wonder OP\u2019s sister was stressed. MIL sounds unhinged for sure, but the whole situation with everyone sitting there waiting for a result sounds like a nightmare lol. And then everyone comes in when the baby isn\u2019t even back with her mother after having been cleaned..? Is this normal somewhere? Why don\u2019t you give them some space and come and visit in a couple of days?", "NTA.\n\nAs always, the birth is the Mom's procedure.  Who's there are the people she wants for support while she's in pain and scared, which is usually her partner and own Mom (two people is a good idea in case it's a long labor and/or baby needs to be separated from Mom and the other parent needs to go with baby).  It's not about who gets to see baby first.\n\nIn fact, paternal relatives need to take a big step back, because often Mom only wants her own people around while she's healing and new to breastfeeding if the couple has decided that's going to happen.  All else being equal things will or at least should even out after Mom is feeling herself, but at the start Mom makes the calls for several reasons.", "No way were you in the wrong. Definitely NTA! He better get his mother in check or she will dictate everything your sister does with her baby. This will cause major issues in their marriage, too. Pull your sister aside once you can go see her and the baby and tell her she has to talk to her husband. Husband needs to put his wife and child first, not his mommy. End of story!", "Posts like this make me appreciate my absentee MIL. She\u2019s crazy in her own way, but I would murder this woman. NTA\u2014and if you are, someone had to say something. I agree with another poster about talking to and supporting your sister. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s being gaslit and shit down by both hubby and MIL from the sound of this. New moms really need to be defended from the crazies; having a newborn is hard enough without them.", "NTA-   \n\nBUT.  \n\nBIL doesn\u2019t see what his mother is doing. And now he can blame you.  Please do apologize-  model being a kind and reasonable person.  \n\n\u201cI\u2019m really sorry I added stress to your day. That I upset you.  If the two of you need some alone time right now without family pushing in, I will totally respect that. \u201c\n\nThis will make it easier to keep MIL away if your sister needs that.  It also keeps you in contact with your sister if she needs a place to flee the abuse.", "NTA, but your sister has a major SO problem.
