The appropriate answer was either to thank her, tell her she would be missed and have your party, or to reassure her that it was not a big deal to wait for however it took her.

You knew the dates of your friends birthdays, but you were planning on going away during that date anyways. That is selfish of you. \n\n2 - Being an outspoken person is a good trait, unless you are being too much, too arrogant, and becoming obnoxious. Great example you provided: You suspected that your friendship was in a rocky place due to her not being as communicative. So you decide to text your friend if things were ok, but not just that, you instantly threw blame at her. Not a good way to start the conversation. That is why she became defensive. You attacked her. \n\n3 - You state that she has a lot of animosity at you for no reason... oh there are reasons and in the small story you wrote, it is clear the reasons why\n\n4 - Your friend (I am guessing your ex-friend now) called you a diva on other friends birthday, which means that you make things all about you instead of the person who's day it really is about. \n\nGood luck OP and I hope that you can start looking inward to see how your behavior of this and other interactions of all your friends is starting to shape up. I would encourage you to start reaching out to all of them and asking the hard questions about how they see you, and be ready to hear things that will not be easy to hear, but necessary to be able to rebuild your friendships and try to salvage them.
