Typically if you are in the same fare you wouldn't get a refund -- e.g. if you are flying main cabin (on Delta, say, fare class Y), the price of an aisle or a center seat would not necessarily vary. However, if you did pay for an additional amenity wrt seat, it's possible that you could finagle a flight credit. While the FA isn't responsible for making that happen for you, they shouldn't have been so exceedingly rude.\n\nCall the airline's customer service at the highest tier of your loyalty status. At a minimum, they will give you a bunch of miles or flight credits for the future for the poor treatment from staff.\n\nIn future, you should know that the back of planes are often used for crew dead-heading, especially on long-haul flights like SYD-LAX. Getting a full row these days is unlikely given the value of those seats.", "NTA. The airline sucks for creating the situation.

Planes that go on long-haul flights have little cabins or spaces for the crew where they can sleep. Crew also have seats of their own where they sit when the plane starts or lands.

And if they are crew, they are paid for working and not for sleeping. even if they are a relief crew.\n\nAlso, the flight attendant seems to have forgotten that she has a customer service job and you were a customer.

Don't planes have rest areas for the crew?", "NTA- i paid for a specific seat, only $17, and for some reason I was moved and I did not get a refund because there was no record of the reason for the move. I was moved by the gate person and issued a new boarding pass before I even boarded the plane. I was told to call customer service and they said that they dont do refunds unless it is non voluntary and if so there would be a note in the computer. But there was nothing to say it was nonvoluntary. Airlines already get enough of our money without volunteering to be scammed out of your paid for seat. You should not feel bad at all.", "[deleted]", "INFO: on what flight is the back row ever considered an upgrade? Was this just a $100 change-of-seat fee?", "I\u2019m honestly on the fence here.\n\nThe flight attendant was an AH to ask that you downgrade to a less comfortable seat and got upset when you asked reasonable questions about getting that $100 back (especially when you said d you\u2019d be willing to change if you did). They still got a row when the front guy was willing to move (maybe he didn\u2019t pay extra and got lucky and got that seat). So why were they miserable?\n\nMaybe you could\u2019ve compromised and said I can shuffle over to the edge of the row and maybe we can share it and both be comfortable?", "NTA - She might have been tired but your question was totally reasonable. If they're going to ask you to voluntarily downgrade, then they should have paid you for the difference on the downgrade. It's not complicated.", "NTA.\n\nBut I'm confused... What does the flight crew's sleep status have to do with where you're sitting?", "It\u2019s hard to say but I\u2019ll have to go with NTA, you did pay an extra 100 and you weren\u2019t obligated to move, yea the other dude may have made you look bad but that\u2019s besides the point, and the flight attendants comment was unnecessary.", "NTA, this wasn\u2019t a cheap $10 upgrade it was a $100 so it\u2019s understandable you\u2019d want to be refunded. If it\u2019s that big of a deal for the relief crew to rest and be comfortable then they should\u2019ve offered you a refund or at least acted like it was possible rather than shutting it down immediately", "NTA. I don\u2019t see the problem. They were getting paid, they can deal with some sleep deprivation or sleep in a sitting position.", "NTA. You paid for that seat. It was just your bad luck that Mr. Nice Guy in the other row made you look like a jerk in comparison.", "NTA. Why would you give 100 bucks away like that? You were willing to change, you just expected the money you paid for the upgrade back. She was obviously rude,  though who is nice whilst sleep deprived? Though staying up for 30 hours traveling is tiresome and you were sleep deprived as well.", "$100 isn't exactly spare change, so I'll say NTA. Especially considering that's a reasonable question, and the attendant was pretty rude with their answer. Calling it a voluntary seat change when you were asked to move is silly excuse because the airline just want to be able to keep the money that way. Couldn't they have put a few flight crew in the row with you without asking you to move?", "I fly a LOT for my work.  I usually bring something along to give to the flight attendants on long haul flights, and I always hand over the book I've finished reading, the ones that I have met love that.  Virtually all FAs that I have met on long haul flights are lovely, and I try to be in return.\n\nI am usually one of the last on a flight, because I am switching seats, trying to find what you found.  I would in no way give up that seat, especially if I paid extra for it.  FAs should have a space to go to on a long haul flight anyway.\n\nI try to always ask for names of people working for the airlines who have helped me more than they should have, I have heard, don't know if it's true, that United gives a gift card to an employee who gets an official thank you, I don't know about other airlines.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I'd have been submitting my first ever complaint, no justification at all for treating you poorly.  NTA.", "NTA it was a reasonable question some people would refuse to even move but you were willing to do that favor and your request was reasonable. The nice guy may not have paid extra for the seats he could have just seen the empty row and moved there.", "NTA. They asked , you declined. Their attitude sucked.", "NTA.   Which airline pulled this stunt?   First off, there are regulations around how many hours a flight crew can work.   If they are overtired because they are working too many hours that is outrageous and should be reported.  Second, you were actually kind enough to be willing to move for a refund which IMO is totally fair.  If the airline's policy is no refund that's one thing.  For the flight attendant to insult you with their \"I'm done with you....\"  comment is also outrageous.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for the seating. If she couldn't commit to a refund then the answer is no.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nSucks to suck for her, but she and the relief crew did decide to do this job, knowing this was a possibility and knowing it's a hard job with LOOONG hours. Now of course if they weren't supposed to be working in the first place, that does suck, but no one on this plane is entitled to your row but you. \n\nYou paid for it. Don't flight attendants mostly say that it you want a seat for yourself, to book earlier and reserve it? Well there ya go, that row was reserved and not empty. She shouldve first of all been nicer and it's ridiculous of her to think she's entitled to your seat that YOU PAID FOR.", "NTA. She was incredibly unprofessional, not in the request, but by how she reacted/handled herself. Besides, long haul flights have sleeping areas hidden from the rest of the plane specifically for crew.", "NTA. \n\nMost people are worried about money during the holidays because everything is effing expensive and we\u2019re not all millionaires", "NTA you booked and paid for your seat and had a right to be comfortable in it. I would also report the flight attendant for her comment. If she felt like money wasn\u2019t important she would have asked how much and went in her purse to reimburse you. Also, the airline could have provided first class seats for the crew instead of making a profit on the seats.", "NTA- I would have said, \u201cI actually paid for an upgrade, if you can bump me up to first class I\u2019d be glad to give up this row. Is there a reason why the pilot can\u2019t sleep in the crew bunk?", "NTA.  I was fully expecting to think you were the asshole, but I think you were perfectly resonable: aggreeing to move if you got refunded for the upgrade you paid for is perfectly resonable.  \n\n\nI feel for her being so tired and for the crew: but you gave a perfectly resonable alternative.", "Flight crew likely can\u2019t tell you what refund you can or can\u2019t have later.   \nDecent thing would be to give up the seat. \n\nYou definitely could have taken the window and let them use the other seats. You didn\u2019t need to sprawl across the row. \n\nThey didn\u2019t have the chance to upgrade. And they can\u2019t sit in the middle of the plane.\n\nYeah, sorry, overall YTA", "NTA if you paid $100.", "YTA. Fortunately, there was another solution, but this wasn\u2019t an official action by the airline. A human being was asking you for a bit of kindness. The airline doesn\u2019t pay people to get adequate rest.", "I\u2019m going with generally NTA here.  The airlines are a crapshow and the flight attendant should have known that would be part of the challenge to the ask.", "I think I'd lose my sanity doing her job so I'm not holding it against her personally and certainly wouldn't make a complaint that could cost her her living. Especially if she really was sleep deprived.", "She was not asking to use the spare seat, she was asking for me to move to another, cheaper seat in another row so that they can use the entire row for themselves to sleep in.", "NTA. How would OP feel if he took the cheaper seat and only to find out he would'nt be refunded at the customer service", "Ops not responsible for the crews sleep deprivation either.. That's in their job description and they signed up for it. They wanted the entire row and kick op to a less expensive seat? Without a refund? \n\nNo.. That's not how that works... It's a shitty situation, but OP paid for the seats, the crew did not.. And if she would've been nicer, maybe, but being an AH definitely won't get you the row to begin with.", "It's a premium seat with more leg room, extra storage on the side of the window seat, and honestly I think that's it. I normally would never pay the extra but decided to take a gamble on nobody else wanting to pay the fee to get a marginally better seat on the off chance that I'd get the whole row.\n\nObviously if anyone did end up seated next to me it would have been a losing gamble and that's that. Including flight crew. But they wanted to boot me into an objectively awful seat (middle, surrounded by two giant families with infants).", "I was already window seat! And I wasn't sprawled out or anything at this point. It was before take off so I was sitting as I would even if there were people in my row. I only paid for my one window seat so of course if they chose to sit next to me I wouldn't say a word.", "From what I understood, they were doing what I ended up doing which is sprawling out and sleeping on the entire row like a bed (they did that with the other row they moved the guy from).", "It was American Airlines", "Sorry I should have clarified. They weren't asking for an individual seat or to sit next to me. They wanted to use the entire row to take shifts sleeping in it (as they did with the other row that was empty that they moved the guy from).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was being asked to move to a middle seat a few rows down. I wouldn't even ask for a refund in ticket price difference if they just wanted to sit next to me. I booked a single ticket, and was just rolling the dice on whether or not I'd get the full row.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf anyone sat next to me, I'd be bummed out, but I'd never complain because obviously I did just pay for my single seat.", "Then she should've said that's she's not sure about the refund instead of saying no. Then they should've upgraded earlier. She also asked for the full row and wanted to boot op out to a seat that's awful and not nearly as expensive. \n\nToo bad.. Should've thought about it earlier or maybe been nicer.. Her lack of sleep is not OPs problem and comes with the job description", "Well you can send him the \uff04100 and he will do it next time.", "I'm not in the business of paying strangers $100 out of the kindness of my heart. Hence the question about if she knew if there would be a refund for the upgrade price.\n\nI expected her to say \"yes of course\" or \"sorry that's something you'll have to ask customer service about\" but when she flat out said \"no refund\" was when I switched to \"I'm not paying extra so YOU can be more comfy\" in my head", "That\u2019s an issue they need to address with the airline. This guy doesn\u2019t have to donate 100 to the cause.", "This is the part that makes you NTA. They could have filled all the seats around you.", "Ah.  Well then, they should have ponied up (at least) $100 cash out of their own damned pockets if it meant that much to them.", "Okay, and at the same time, these are the people responsible for the safety of everyone on the plane, not just their comfort. You had an opportunity to be kind and thought $100 was too much for kindness.", "You\u2019re wrong. This isn\u2019t about kindness. Paying money for an upgrade and feeling forced to just forfeit it is not kindness."]}
