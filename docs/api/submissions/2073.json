I am a mom of 3 and been married to my husband for 18 years. Last year my husband was in an accident.

He is now in a wheelchair and gets the bare minimum for disability that hardly even covers his meds. \n\nThe place we moved is a 2nd floor apartment in income based housing. We have been here 7 months. 3 months ago they moved in a woman and her two kids upstairs and now all of us have bed bugs. It's been so mentally exhausting and down right embarrassing. We have had to pull the kids from school for the time being and they finally sent someone out two days ago to do a treatment after begging for over a month and a half. They gave us a list of things we needed to do, such as empty all drawers and put clothes in bags, move beds and furniture away from walls, etc. We did everything as requested. We had also installed a small, cheap video camera in our bedroom facing the livingroom as a precaution because we couldn't move out all of my husband's medical equipment and we had to be out of the home for 24 hours. \n\nWhen we got back home our apartment was destroyed. The worker had emptied all of our clothes bags on to a giant pile on the livingroom floor, our recliner was tipped on it's front with a leg broken, couch was ripped apart (the cushions don't come off but the guy ripped them off), our back door that leads out to our laundry area was wide open (despite us being told they didn't need to go in there) so not only we're all our shoes melted but my son's 3 fish were also dead from being cooked alive (heat treatment) and he also put a blanket over our camera. To do what, I'm not sure. But we didn't physically see him do anything of this because he put the blanket over it before doing anything else. \n\nI immediately called the company after taking pictures of everything and told them I was absolutely disgusted and expected this to be taken care of and then sent the pictures to them. They were very apologetic and didn't charge my landlord for the treatment cost.

If he didn't know what he was doing, he should have had a trainer with him to train him. \n\nCovering up the camera pretty much shows he knew he was doing wrong.", "NTA. Unless you\u2019re leaving something out, you didn\u2019t even demand he be fired. You just expressed your outrage at something outrageous. The blanket over the camera is especially troubling (was it hidden or did he definitely cover it on purpose?) \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you went through this. I\u2019ve had bedbugs in a very nice housing development\u2014it could happen to anyone, especially when sharing walls, and there shouldn\u2019t be stigma around it.
