I am a mom of 3 and been married to my husband for 18 years. Last year my husband was in an accident.

He is now in a wheelchair and gets the bare minimum for disability that hardly even covers his meds. \n\nThe place we moved is a 2nd floor apartment in income based housing. We have been here 7 months. 3 months ago they moved in a woman and her two kids upstairs and now all of us have bed bugs. It's been so mentally exhausting and down right embarrassing. We have had to pull the kids from school for the time being and they finally sent someone out two days ago to do a treatment after begging for over a month and a half. They gave us a list of things we needed to do, such as empty all drawers and put clothes in bags, move beds and furniture away from walls, etc. We did everything as requested. We had also installed a small, cheap video camera in our bedroom facing the livingroom as a precaution because we couldn't move out all of my husband's medical equipment and we had to be out of the home for 24 hours. \n\nWhen we got back home our apartment was destroyed. The worker had emptied all of our clothes bags on to a giant pile on the livingroom floor, our recliner was tipped on it's front with a leg broken, couch was ripped apart (the cushions don't come off but the guy ripped them off), our back door that leads out to our laundry area was wide open (despite us being told they didn't need to go in there) so not only we're all our shoes melted but my son's 3 fish were also dead from being cooked alive (heat treatment) and he also put a blanket over our camera. To do what, I'm not sure. But we didn't physically see him do anything of this because he put the blanket over it before doing anything else. \n\nI immediately called the company after taking pictures of everything and told them I was absolutely disgusted and expected this to be taken care of and then sent the pictures to them. They were very apologetic and didn't charge my landlord for the treatment cost.

He demonstrated that he was not. You did the company and it\u2019s future customers a favour.\n\nBtw, I\u2019m so sorry about your string of bad luck. I really hope things turn around for you.", "NTA, screw him, but also are your belongings going to be replaced? The shoes, at minimum?", "NTA\nHe is new to the job and didnt know what he was doing? Im sorry but I think on day one you learn not to rip apart peoples houses and kill there fish? Or did he call in sick on the first day of work and miss that information or maybe that page was ripped out of his handbook.", "NTA. He trashed your home, and covered a camera.

Well, two of the cabins got bed bugs & they were treated without any damage to the home furnishings. OP didn\u2019t get the guy fired & even if he hadn\u2019t been trained properly (his employers fault), he acted like a caveman & no way the cover-up of the camera was an accident. Also guarantee the ones calling OP the c word would be livid if there belongings & pet fish was destroyed.", "Right? What kinda mental gymnastics are they on? Like what kinda person who can hold a job thinks trashing the house as if they are a living tornado is ok?", "Why would she need to consult a lawyer?", "A caveman lol!  No disrespect to OP because I would be pissed too but can\u2019t help but imagining cartoon character Captain Caveman was the exterminator.", "to sue the company that destroyed her belongings", "Since the company admitted fault and didn't charge the landlord, she should try to settle out of court first without having to pay attorneys fees.", "NTA.  I am an exterminator. I suspect your landlord just chose the cheapest service. Destruction is not part of a bed bug service! Document everything. The pest company should be responsible for having an untrained individual do this work. Sorry this happened to you.", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't know what he was doing then he needed more training.

Because what he did was grounds for dismissal, obviously.", "NTA", "NTA. everything except the fish is on the company and they should replace it.

Bit I am not you so I can't make you.", "NTA!", "Nta. He definitely did it on purpose because what type of person would close the camera? A person who didn\u2019t what their action seen. \n\nTell those people, that you are a mother of three and also takes care of your disabled husband, living with only a single income and a bare minimum for disability.

He sought to humiliate you and your family by destroying your home. \n\nI understand your neighbors may not be in the best financial position and not want to take away someone else\u2019s job, but that\u2019s not an excuse to let someone vandalize a home. Personally, I\u2019d be itemizing everything he damaged and making sure nothing is missing. I would hold him and the company financially responsible for your items and the emotional distress.", "NTA, OMG, what in the hell did I just read? Employees have to do the work they are paid for if they want to stay employed. Not only did he not do his job he destroyed your personal belongings. I don't care if he has octuplets to support.

I'm sorry you are surrounded by idiots at your apartment complex.\n\nHe got himself fired.", "Definitely not.", "YTA, if you wanted something done a certain way, you should have done it that way yourself.", "Right lol. If he really didn't know any better why wasn't someone there with him training him?

Covering the camera is shady.\nNTA.", "Also, it\u2019s suspicious that they said they didn\u2019t need to go into the laundry room. Bedbugs can survive almost anywhere and can definitely be in the laundry room. Best way to treat them is to treat the whole house, you can\u2019t really ignore one area. I think that\u2019s more a failing of the company for misinforming OP.", "My guess for the broken furniture is beyond vandalism for the sake of vandalism he was tearing the place apart looking for valuables", "The amount that they will give you to settle out of court will likely be significantly higher if they know you have a lawyer. Otherwise they will lowball.

Yeah right. NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nThis is what people refer to as him \"tossing\" your place. He was looking for expensive stuff you'd hidden, which is why he covered the camera. I'd honestly go to the police and file a report on the guy for vandalism on top of getting him fired.", "NTA This isn't your fault. The company shouldn't have sent an incompetent person to do the work. The employee may have not been trained properly, and that isn't your fault either. It also isn't your fault the employee had a new baby. \n\nYou complained to the company contracted to do the work. That is a reasonable thing to do. If they want to blame someone, blame the company for poor training, the person who brought the bed bugs into the apartment. The employee for not requesting help or additional training. Nobody should blame you.", "NTA. On what planet was covering the camera a wise thing if he was new and needed his job. He was looking for something in your apartment. Or possibly he took a medication and had a bit of a psychosis moment idk but there\u2019s no reason for things to be destroyed and fish to be dead. He deserved to lose his job", "Should of been trained if he was new.", "NTA at all", "NTA", "NTA They need to pay you for the stuff they destroyed, not just give your landlord a break on the cost!", "NTA! I don\u2019t care how new he was on the actual field, do you know what legitimate people pay for education and how to do this job properly? The blanket on the camera is a major red flag! This guy just didn\u2019t want you to have evidence and get caught for his misdeeds! Bet you if you didn\u2019t do/say anything there would be many more victims out there than the plethora that already exist!", "ESH. Obviously the worker sucks for doing that to your place. But you are also the asshole for not taking proper care of the poor fish. Imagine being boiled alive.", "The camera is a dead give away. If I were OP, even if I came home to a relatively normal looking apartment, if I see that this guy covered the camera I\u2019m immediately making assumptions. None of them good. \n\nNTA, and I have a feeling your neighbours would be singing a different tune if this happened in their apartment and not yours.", "Yup, I haven\u2019t the faintest clue about how to be a pest exterminator but even without the aid of this post I think I could have worked out that it didn\u2019t include breaking furniture or ruining cushions.", "That was my first thought. Cover over the camera and then toss the bags looking for stuff to steal."]}
