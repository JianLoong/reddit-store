She has always been prioritised by my Dad and I ask him about it and his answer was \u201eShe is so young, you are so much older. You don\u2019t need me as much anymore.\u201c When she was around 5 years old my dad divorced her Mom and went to have another family.\nHe is now forcing connections between us three siblings, but I honestly don\u2019t want it.
