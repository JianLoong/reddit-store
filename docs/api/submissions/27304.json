Recently, they finalized a divorce and he got pretty screwed financially (he will still be fine). He found out I had made comments about her before they got married and got upset with me for not talking to him about it.\n\nSome background - my cousin is a pretty successful guy. Started multiple tech companies and made a bunch of money at a young age. When he started dating his ex wife, I suspected she was in it for the money. My assumption was always that he knew what the deal was. He's a highly intelligent guy, but he's pretty socially awkward and not conventionally attractive. She seemed like a materialistic, wannabe Instagram model. It was pretty obvious to me but I was happy for him for getting attention from an attractive woman. Might as well have some fun after all his hard work, right?\n\nWell not long after they started dating, I heard they got engaged. My mom shared the news with me and my immediate reaction was less than enthusiastic, so she pried. I told her it seemed like his fiance was only interested in his money but conceded that I don't see them enough (living in a different city) so maybe things are better than I think. She scolded me for saying that and I felt like a bit of an asshole. My family seemed to really like her, so I never brought it up again. They got married, had a kid, etc. \n\nWell the divorce happened and it was not amicable. I guess she got A LOT of his assets, like millions. She's also being very difficult about their kid. My mom and aunt (his mom) approached me on my last visit home and asked how I knew years earlier. I told them I felt like it was pretty obvious and I was honestly surprised no one in the family felt that way. Then a couple days later my cousin approached me. He felt like I was talking shit behind his back (it was literally that one time) and I should have talked to him about it. I'm kind of annoyed that he found out about what I said, but my mom and aunt are notorious for having big mouths so I should have known better. I also don't think I am close enough to my cousin that he would have taken me seriously. He feels like I could have saved him from a miserable marriage experience, losing a bunch of assets, and having to now deal with child custody issues. My mom and aunt aren't too happy with me about it either, even though my mom basically stopped me from saying anything.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nTL;DR - Cousin married a gold digger and I voiced my suspicion behind his back, one time, before they got married.

Hardly anyone listens in these situations.

You were the ass hole when you told your mom, and you would have been a HUGE asshole if you tried to tell your cousin. You did everything you could, and theyre still calling you the asshole. You did your best. It's not your fault.", "NTA. He wouldn't have believed you anyway, especially if you aren't that close. And just because they got divorced doesn't mean you were right about his ex. If he's seriously wishing you had said something to stop the wedding, then he's wishing his child didn't exist. A man who'd look at the situation that way probably wasn't any better a husband than he is a father.", "NTA\n\nNobody wants relationship advice from a cousin they rarely see about a woman that cousin hasn't met.\n\nAt best your cousin would've laughed off your warning. They might have gone further and thought you were jealous, or just trying to stop them from being happy.\n\nThe only way you could've safely delivered your warning is if your cousin had directly asked you for your opinion, and even then it probably would've been rejected.", "NTA - sounds like he wouldn't have listened even if you said something back them. This is a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. \n\nSure you MIGHT have saved him the headache down the line, but there's no guarantee he listens and blows you off exactly like how your mum and aunt did.", "NTA", "NTA-for being as smart as you say he is, he should\u2019ve got a pre-nup.", "Your cousin has multiple tech exits as a founder and didn\u2019t have a prenup? Right", "NTA, but I wouldn't advise you spend effort on getting him to admit you aren't.

I realize he's probably not thinking too rationally and wants someone to blame, though", "I do think there are tactful ways I could have shared my opinion if I wanted to. Honestly, I was never fond of her and not that tight with my cousin so I probably wouldn't have cared if they were upset with me. But yeah, why deal with the drama", "Haha I've actually been scolded by my mom a lot for talking shit about other family members. She's very protective of them", "I don't know what/how I would have told him. I'm still shocked no one else in the family said anything. I assumed someone closer to him would have because it seemed that obvious.\n\nThat said, my family can be pretty socially unaware and my cousin really exemplifies that.

I'd like to re emphasize that I only stated my suspicion when she pried and literally never brought it up again.\n\nEdit: and you're right, I don't know the details. But everyone in the family who knows the situation better seems to now think she's a gold digger.", "Depends on how quickly it all went to shit because she got what she wanted with the wedding. Of course she was in a hurry to get married and get it over with as soon as possible. Even exchange is arguable, but he was blindly in love so I guess it's on his immediate surrounding of people close to him for not showing the signs of a potential gold digger.\n\nAnd yes, that's a gold digger if she wouldn't have been with him if not for his money and once she could claim half of it plus child support, she opted out.", "Yeah, I'm usually not one to shy away from speaking up, but I didn't feel confident in my suspicion after my mom scolded me. It was so obvious that I figured they must have thought about it already and knew something I didn't.", "So I'll tell you how it would've gone: \n\nYou recommend that he gets a pre-nup. EITHER he gets mad at you for implying that the only reason someone would want to be with him is money OR his fianc\u00e9e calls off the wedding and he gets mad at you for ruining their relationship.\n\nIf he wants someone to blame you might be able to redirect it onto your mum. Say that you wanted to say something but she got mad and told you not to say.", "You are NTA, OP, but you are the most convenient available scapegoat.\n\nYour cousin\u2019s heart and pride are wounded and he\u2019s looking for a place to put the blame. You happened to make yourself a target and he gladly accepted the chance to point the finger anywhere but himself.\n\nIf your cousin is successful and wealthy enough to have lost assets worth millions in a divorce, I guarantee he has had plenty of exposure to the importance of lawyers, financial advisors, and prenups. He chose not to avail himself of those options and paid a hefty price.\n\nIf they drop it now, you could do him the favor of letting him feel better for a few minutes and move on. But you\u2019ll really have your answer the next time he falls for a girl and he asks you for your opinion - or doesn\u2019t.", "He\u2019s hurting, likely emotionally as well as financially, and wishes there was some way to undo the last few years of his life. Don\u2019t carry guilt for his decisions or for having normal conversations with people. You weren\u2019t running around talking behind his back. Maybe try to give him grace while he works through all this if you can.", "The only problem is that the only evidence you seem to have had at the time of the comment, is that in your opinion your cousin is so unattractive physically and in terms of his character, that she could not possibly be attracted to him for any other reason than his money. That makes you a bit of an AH.\n\nNTA for not warning him. He would not have believed you and if you explained your reasoning, he probably would have been much more upset than he is now.", "He's looking for someone to blame for his own stupidity and denial. He fell for the most common con in modern history.", ">I realize he's probably not thinking too rationally and wants someone to blame, though\n\nYeah that is very likely.\n\nJust a question though, how is it even possible that the ex gets millions of $ of assets if he brought all that into the marriage? Sounds like a screwed up system. Where I live (Germany) the default is that everybody keeps the stuff they bring into the marriage (this includes future inheritances from parents etc.) but everything else you make during the marriage is always shared 50-50 by default. (income from working, business you start together, etc.)", "I tried to tell my best friend my suspicions about his fiance, and he denied it and immediately told her, so she hated me with a vengeance, and suddenly we weren't best friends anymore. \n\nYou can't win in that scenario.", "Just tell him that you did voice concerns years earlier but that your mum scolded you and you figured that she would know better than you because of the distance issue keeping you from seeing him and his fiance more and assumed that people that spent more time with him would know their relationship dynamics better than you.\n\nAtleast that way it should turn him on your mum and off you since we'll \"hey, if you picked it out after a few meetings why didn't the people who spent more time with them pick anything up\" especially since these means that even after hearing your opinion your mother still didn't mention anything especially to your cousins mum whom she is apparently gossip buddies with.", "Maybe keep that shit to yourself if you get scolded, just to save yourself headaches later on.", "Has anyone in your family talked to her about what happened? Gotten her side of the story?\n\nThe most reasonable explanation is that the divorce was fair but your cousin had an unreasonable expectation for what fair looked like. And if he can\u2019t see his kid, he earned that for sure. Dads that fight for joint custody usually get it.", "Probably should have declined to answer when my mom pressed!", "I mean, I don't know all the details. I know she quit her job shortly after they started dating. I also know there was a lot of contention with her partying habits. Either way, was I an asshole just for voicing an opinion just once and keeping my mouth shut for 4 years?", "Yep.", "No", "Of course not. You're totally fine. Your mom needs to not have such a big mouth. Many people can see relationships for what they are from the outside. But it's not your relationship, your cousin is immature to blame you. He should suck it up and admit you're right."]}
