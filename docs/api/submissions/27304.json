Started multiple tech companies and made a bunch of money at a young age. When he started dating his ex wife, I suspected she was in it for the money. My assumption was always that he knew what the deal was. He's a highly intelligent guy, but he's pretty socially awkward and not conventionally attractive. She seemed like a materialistic, wannabe Instagram model. It was pretty obvious to me but I was happy for him for getting attention from an attractive woman. Might as well have some fun after all his hard work, right?\n\nWell not long after they started dating, I heard they got engaged. My mom shared the news with me and my immediate reaction was less than enthusiastic, so she pried. I told her it seemed like his fiance was only interested in his money but conceded that I don't see them enough (living in a different city) so maybe things are better than I think.

Dont take it personaly. He'll get over it sooner or later.", "NTA, no matter wjat you would have done you would have been an AH in their eyes because some people will always try to blame others for their problems, mistskes and incompetence. \nYou didn't say anything, now you're the AH for not saving your cousin from a gold digger, if you had said something to him, then you'd be the AH for ruining a relationship.

If you had said something to him 4 years ago, when he was younger, rich, and in love with a beautiful woman, what kind of reception would you have gotten?\n\nYour family is now looking at your prior comment with the benefit of hindsight. NVM the fact that your mom \"scolded\" you when you originally brought it up after the engagement.", "NTA.  You tried to bring it up at the time, but the women in your family silenced you, because how dare you criticize a woman.  And now that you were proven right, these same women have chosen to blab to your cousin and put you in an awkward situation.  They are the assholes here, not you.", "NTA - give me a break.  do you think for one second he would have listened to you trash-talking the love of his life?", "NTA.

But he's gotta be real and honest about it, too. Telling him something like that when he's in love and getting married surely wouldn't have gone well! And there's always the risk that you could have been wrong about her. This kind of thing is always hard because you're damned if you warn them and damned if you don't. The reaction you got from your mom back then was a clear indication to keep it to yourself so I guess if he has to blame someone it ought to be your mother, not you.", "If he\u2019s dumb enough to blame you now, he wouldn\u2019t have been smart enough to listen before.

There\u2019s a guy in my friend group (wish my friends were as fed up with him as I am) who is a manipulative compulsive liar and chronic deadbeat job hopper, and he started dating this pharmacist girl who was just oh so sweet but really not all that pretty. My friend isn\u2019t a showstopper but the disparity in looks was pretty obvious that he was more attractive than her. Myself and all my buddies were like yeah he\u2019s just with her for some stability in his life and he doesn\u2019t actually like her. About 4 years in and he cheated on her with multiple women and participated in a porno orgy where he had unprotected sex with 3 women on camera. She found the video cause dummy bookmarked it on his computer, they divorce. She is still in with all the wives everyone loves her so I see her from time to time, we get to talking one night and the fact that we all know he\u2019s a slimy sleaze ball comes up and she gets frustrated with all of us for not warning her on the front end.

I told him she was a gold digger. We had a massive fight over it and didn't speak for 3 years and only now after she divorced him and took a lot of his assets as well have we really started having a relationship again. So there was no way you could win.", "NTA.\n\nI'm going to guess that your cousin isn't the victim he's pretending to be here, judging by his actions towards you (effectively blaming you for something you weren't any part of). His ex might have been an asshole gold digger, but he was probably an asshole in plenty of ways in his own right. The fact that he's having custody issues suggests some bad things on his part, a wealthy dad who wants custody is almost guaranteed of 50/50 at worst if he puts any effort in.  I bet they were a perfect match of assholes.\n\nYour mom is rather an AH here too - she shot down your opinion (which may have been justified on your part), but then repeated this to your aunt/cousin years later? WTF? Gossipy BS, she should be ashamed.\n\nI'd cut contact with your cousin and put mom on an information diet.", "You didn't have inside information, you just had an opinion.\n\nTurns out you had an *accurate* opinion, but at the time nobody would have given it enough weight to change their mind about the woman \u2014 as your mom demonstrated.\n\nIt wasn't your circus or your monkeys. And, honestly, if your cousin was as smart as everyone thinks, he would have negotiated a pre-nup just in case.\n\nNTA", "First of all. It's sexist to imply gold digger is a gendered thing. Plenty of men worldwide are gold diggers. Just watch 90 day fiance. It's a running joke about attractive Caribbean men. Secondly, both sides are judged when you marry a golddiger. The young attractive partner is seen as a cold opportunist, and the old rich partner is seen as desperate and pathetic. \n\nI'm sure OP would feel the same way if the genders were reversed.", "Isn\u2019t that what a gold digger literally is? Somebody that is trading their good looks for a relationship where they get more money than they can earn ?", "That's the definition of a gold digger, yes.", "From what I heard, gold diggers have at least one child with the rich guy, so the courts, during proceedings, will favour the woman more. After hearing and reading about it so much, I can believe that the gold diggers don't even love their child. (Isn't that why there are several stories about baby trapping? There was one with Drake where the woman who slept with him took a discarded condom and squeezed the semen inside her vagina. But Drake mixed some hot sauce in the condom before discarding it because he heard it kills the sperm. She then tried to sue him for the money anyway and failed. )", "Sure there\u2019s a reason why - the law is blind. If they combined finances and owned everything jointly, it\u2019s going to be tough to say 90% of their money (random percentage) is actually his or whatnot. The OP may well not know the full story. Maybe the cousin\u2019s abusive. Maybe the ex-wife is withholding visitation. We don\u2019t know. But based squarely on the post it does sound like the cousin got screwed. \n\nAgain, the law is blind. I know a woman who had a child with a man who was very abusive. This woman did have a wild side and had some roughness around the edges - but overall a decent person. She wasn\u2019t a barred attorney, but she graduated from Georgetown School of Law in DC.\n\nAgain, the father was abusive. Unfortunately she had never filed a police report, complaint, or anything like that. They went to custody court, and his attorney presented harassing text messages she had sent over time as evidence. There was no evidence of his abuse, aside from her words, but there was evidence that she had harassed him. The father was awarded custody - that he neither wanted nor deserved. He only filed for custody because he wanted to get at her. She should have known better since she went to law school. But again, the law is blind.", "THANK YOU, I feel like I\u2019m in bizarro world with all of these N T A responses. \n\nI\u2019ve seen nothing in OP\u2019s post or replies that indicate she was a gold digger. So N T A for not telling your cousin because there was nothing to tell. YTA for your misogynist conjecture, though.", "This is the weirdest take I've seen. The conclusion isn't remain unmarried your whole life. The conclusion should be don't chase after women solely because of their looks and find your equal. I'm sure he could have found an amazing, successful equally attractive woman. But he decided her looks were more important than his wealth and wellbeing.", "All you had was a feeling, right? This wasn't based on anything overt that she did or said, but was because of their uneven levels of attractiveness.  Saying anything at the time probably would have made you seem like an shallow, judgemental jerk.  It was on your cousin to protect his assets and not be blinded by a hot girl finally noticing him.", "NTA: You told your mother about your suspicions, she decided (or not) to talk about this at that time with \u00ab\u00a0her sister\u00a0\u00bb. They are the one who are talking now and didn\u2019t talk earlier, you did your part, your mother listened to you and decided or not to pass it on, easy for her to blame you now\u2026 love is blind, gold diggers know that, thats why she got married quickly, with child support, you get more money\u2026", "Yup, easier to blame you than accept his choices have consequences.", "But like what is your mom not happy about? You told her, she shut you down, does she feel like you should have ostracized yourself from the family due to your gut feeling, because if no one else saw it then you would not have gotten far.", "He is looking for someone other than himself to blame. \n\nI bet the red flags where flying high but he wasn\u2019t able to see them. Now he is looking back and kicking himself in the ass. \n\nThis is a lesson learned for him. Don\u2019t feel guilty. You stayed out of it. You held your opinion. I admire your self restraint.", "Or he might have listened and you could've been wrong about her. There's no way to know.", "Absolutely no way he would have listened. A guy who is getting laid on the regular by a pretty girl is not going to listen to anyone.", "OP: Cousin, my intuition tells me that she is no good for you. She is after your money. You need to ditch her.\n\nCOUSIN: Explain please. What would make you think that way?\n\nOP: if not for the money, no girl with her looks & personality and in her right mind would fall for a guy with your looks & awkward personality.\n\nCOUSIN: You have always been jealous of my success and now you want to steal my trophy girl. Get out and don't show your face here again.", "Your cousin now has a child, an heir, it comes with pain because the relationship he had with the mother was fake. Hope he can build a true relationship with his child, love, encouragement, support, and stop focusing of being depraved financially, his gain is much more than the money he lost. Hope in the future he will find true love, not stereotyped beauty. But with his child, he can choose love over other pride and prejudice.", "This is more like a successful man, with below average looks and awkward personality getting himself a trophy wife. They got married, had kid and things didn't workout. Wife got assets after divorce, as is normal. Even poor people get divorced and marital assets whatever they have gets split.\n\nOP hasn't specified anything concrete about her that paints her as a gold digger. Maybe they both were in love initially and just fell apart after marriage and a child.\n\nIn my opinion, she would count as a gold digger only if she was opposed to a prenup or baby trapped the guy or somethings like that.", "In a lot of states in the us, pretty much all assets that are acquired during the marriage are considered to be joint property and are split 50/50, regardless of who earned the money.  There are a few exceptions for things like inheritances.", "The guy your responding to is likely an incel.  They firmly believe \u201call women are like that\u201d because they constantly chase women out of their leagues and either have no success or get used for money.", "To be fair, if cousin was smart enough to start multiple businesses, he should have enough brain cells to insist on a pre-nup. It should be instictive survival skill for any successful person to protect what they built and accomplished. The only reasons I've seen people immediately dismiss getting a pre-nup (meaning not giving in to the other party's refusal to get one) is that their ego gets in the way i.e. fiance/fiancee are so in love with them and it will be that way forever.", "If the business did really well for example if he made 5 million during during the marriage she would be entitled to half of that. Plus if her name was on the deeds to any property or cars even though she never contributed to any of it she would have a claim on it.", "I\u2019m not a lawyer, but it matters how the terms of the divorce go. They\u2019re all different. It would be so much simpler if everyone took what they brought. But if the income disparity is that big odds are she got alimony. And obviously child support.", "In the US, the kid changes everything.\n\nIf they were childless, and he brought assets to the marriage that he was able to keep fairly separate, in most cases he wouldn\u2019t have to split the pre marriage value he brought 50-50 (though he might have to split some of the gains on those assets that happened during the marriage which could be the case here).\n\nOnce you have a kid and establish a certain family lifestyle a judge is more likely to give the custodial parent more so that the impact of the divorce on the child is less.\n\nI understand the logic, but in reality it is a crappy system because there are no steps taken to insure the spouse that gets the children and the extra money actually spends that extra money on the children, and you end up having some parents fight over custody not because they want the kids but because it has a financial impact.", "Prenups aren't a guarantee to be protection, though.  Some places basically say they're void once kids are in the picture, for that you need a postnup that was written *after* children were born.", "If that's how it was, then she didn't get *his* assets at all.  She got half of *their* assets.", "Makes sense, thanks!", "I agree with everything you said, thanks for the explanation.", "Of course not. But why is everyone else in your family treating your unsubstantiated proofless opinion like you were some Oracle with ability to predict the future?", "No, because you didn't really know anything.  You were just speculating.  When you were talking about it to your mother you were just gossiping.", "All of which cousin's very competent and expensive lawyer would have advised him of.", "Why would prenups dictate child custody issues before the children even exist?", "We\u2019ll never know if it was his or their assets but when I hear stuff like she took all \u2018my\u2019 money I do assume the other persons being a bit bitter. It\u2019s like when they say she took the house but neglect to mention that he gets to keep his company, all the money in his name or his pension.", "Don't forget, the story is also multi-hand. OP says he's not close to his cousin. Did the cousin really have to give up \"millions\" after a four-year marriage? \n\nMost divorces in the U.S. are settled in mediation, not in court. So it's wise to remain skeptical.", "She quit her job when they started dating, and kept partying like she was single.

According to OP ex-SIL wanted to be an Instagram influencer. It is quite possible that the cousin actively encouraged her to quit her job and pursue her ambition.
