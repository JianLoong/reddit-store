Okay so make her a PB chocolate cake and him a regular chocolate cake. It doesn't sound like you sat down and explained your budget and asked her if she would like something within your price range, but rather argued instead. \"We don't eat Indian food\" okay, so order her takeout from her favorite place and you get fast food. It doesn't sound like you even remotely tried to accommodate. That's why YTA.", "So you said she cannot have a party but\n\nshe can have cake - but not the one she wants\n\nshe can have a gift - but not the one she wants\n\nshe can have a meal out - but not the one she wants\n\njust wondering if money is just as tight when its her brother's birthday?", "YTA. Okay, you can't afford a party or a tablet, that just is, that does not make you an AH. \n\nBut you have not indicated that your son is so allergic to peanuts that he can't be in the same room as a peanut butter chocolate cake, especially because you said she could have a cupcake. It's her birthday, get her the cake she wants and get him the cupcake. As for this whole business about keeping a kid out of a cake being hard, you should be teaching that anyway but especially for a kid with an allergy. \n\nAnd you haven't even tried to accommodate her on the Indian food. No one else likes Indian. Well, it's her birthday. What can be done here? If her siblings won't eat it, is there a family member who will watch her siblings while you take her to an Indian place? Surely you, as an adult, can suck it up for one meal on your daughter's birthday to make her happy, right? Or, maybe you get her Indian takeout and pizza for everyone else and eat at home. \n\nThe message you are sending here is that everyone else comes before your daughter, so I'm not at all surprised she went to her dad if he makes her feel valued. You won't even make her feel valued and special on her own birthday.", "YTA\n\nYou aren't honoring ANY of her requests.\n\nIt appears her dad is willing to, since she left with him............\n\nGood Luck", "I can fully understand not being able to give her everything she wants. But it also sounds like you're determined to give her absolutely nothing she wants. Why?", "YTA. You said she\u2019s being selfish, but it\u2019s her birthday. You asked her what she wanted and then proceeded to shut down everything she said. It\u2019s not that you can\u2019t afford the tablet or a grand party, YTA because you\u2019re making her birthday about what you and your son want. Get your son the cupcake. Let her get the food she wants and order you and your son something else. She\u2019s going to resent you if you don\u2019t prioritize her wants now and then, too.", "Yta- she doesn't get the gift, the restaurant or cake of her choice.   It's her birthday you could at least let her get one thing she wants.   The cake would be the least expensive and you can't even do that for her.   Let me guess, her brother is perfect.", "YTA. \n\nI get not being able to afford everything she wants but this is becoming a situation where she gets nothing she wants. You didn't even make an attempt to get her a special or meaningful gift, you got her a throwaway gift. The cake thing is somewhat understandable although getting the allergic kid an alternative would have been a better choice. And the restaurant thing is just ridiculous on your part. Instead of a dinner of her choice she gets fast food of your choice. Not even a special dinner, just fast food. If the other kids won't eat Indian food then why not just take her for a nice meal on her own? And you not liking Indian food is a non-issue. You are an adult, suck it up for one evening. \n\nYou told her she had choices and then took all of her choices away because they don't meet your desires. Her birthday is now about you and the other kids.", "YTA it's her birthday, the one day of the year that's supposed to be all about her. You seem more focused on what works for everyone else more than the birthday girl. You seem to have a chip on your shoulder with her. \n\nYour son can survive missing out on a slice of HER birthday cake. Get her Indian if that's what she wants, get take out and let her bring her best friend. \n\nShe's also TA for throwing a tantrum, but is probably frustrated that you can't just let her have one day of the year that's all about her", "YTA based on your responses to other commentators and also based on your prioritization of everyone else over her for *her* birthday. it\u2019s not her little brother\u2019s birthday, it\u2019s *hers* and she wanted a peanut butter cake. get HIM the cupcake, see how easy that is? instead, you have clearly shown her that even on her special day she is not as important as your other children. of course she\u2019s not talking to you after all that. i get money being tight, im a single mom, that\u2019s not an excuse to make your daughter feel unimportant on her *birthday*.", "YTA , you are not the asshole for not being able to afford a birthday party but absolutely are for not getting her the cake and food she wants , its her birthday you can get the brother a cupcake and can tolerate indian food for a day or take her out to eat that then eat smth else", "YTA. Hard for teens to understand budgeting but a small, fun but no frills  party could have been figured out if what she really wanted was time with her friends . My mom didn\u2019t have a lot one year but my beat ever bday memory was a back yard party where we played games and my uncles brought water balloons for a \u201ctoss\u201d that descended into an all-out war. Cost her very little, esp as she bought the plain and cheap box cake that year and served a cheap pasta lunch to save money. \n\nIf a party of any kind wasn\u2019t feasible\u2026 specifically requesting foods she knows no one else likes or can eat translated to you as a selfish move but in fact may be \u201cI never get to have these thing s that I love because no one else loves them so I want to request them for my birthday.\u201d If you\u2019re offering a separate cupcake for her you could EASILY have just gotten a separate cupcake for the brother instead so she got her favorite for her birthday.\n\nYou really mishandled this entire situation. Yikes!", "YTA. You didn\u2019t give her one single thing she asked for. Instead you made it all about her siblings. I\u2019m betting her tantrum is bc this kind of thing happens a lot. You even talk about how your other kids never pull this. I wonder if your younger children have a different dad? It almost seems like you intentionally treat this child differently.", "YTA. Why does she have to accommodate everyone else? CAN\u2019T ONE MEAL IN THE ENTIRE YEAR  BE ALL ABOUT HER????\n\nWhy don\u2019t you get a peanut butter cake and her brother can get a chocolate cupcake or \u2026. How about this? \u2026. he can NOT eat dessert this one night???  If you get her brother a special cupcake (I\u2019m assuming chocolate is his favorite) on HER birthday, you should also get her a peanut butter cupcake on HIS birthday. I realize having an allergy is different, but you getting him his FAVORITE flavor is rewarding him for having an allergy and punishing her for not. The non-birthday child gets vanilla, or eat something else.\n\nIf you allow everyone else in the family to choose their birthday dinner, then your daughter should be allowed to as well. You can take the family out for fast food afterwards if anyone is still hungry, but I think you can ask for Naan and butter and ask for recommendations from the server. Maybe you even want to try the dishes your daughter orders and you\u2019ll find you like it.", "YTA. you can buy a small PB cake, and a regular cupcake for your son. and don\u2019t give that dumb excuse of \u201c try keeping a 4 year old away from cake!!\u201d parents keep their kids away from food they\u2019re allergic to all the time. and i\u2019m sure you could get over one night of indian food, there\u2019s probably SOMETHING on that menu you\u2019ll eat. the only understandable thing is the tablet. other than that, yta", "YTA. Not being able to afford things is completely understandable and she does need to be able to learn that finances very often mean that people don\u2019t get what they want. \n\nBut, she didn\u2019t get a single thing that she wanted, even when it had nothing to do with cost. \n\nI assume she can eat peanuts when outside of the house, right? Serve the cake at a park and get a cupcake for your son. Come up with some way that she can have the cake she wants. It\u2019s not impossible. \n\nAnd you said she could pick the restaurant and then just picked yourself instead. Those of you who don\u2019t like that food can eat at home right before you go and the can all join her for her own meal at the restaurant. \n\nAs for the tablet, I probably would have just not gotten anything and waited until she picked something within the price range that was acceptable.", "YTA you need to learn how to better communicatie with your daughter, no wonder the poor lass is confused.", "After reading your comments, you're the biggest AH. The day wasn't about what you or your other kids like. The least you could've done is gotten her the cake she likes. Who cares what you and your other kids like? It's not y'alls birthday", "YTA how are you gonna tell her \u201cwe can\u2019t throw you a party but we can give you these three things!\u201d Then proceed to not give her those three things? In all honesty she\u2019s old enough to know the families financial situation but you guys gave her nothing and expected her to deal with it\u2026?", "INFO: I don\u2019t understand the part about not being able to afford a birthday party though. All you really need for a party is a cake, some snacks, and friends. Buying some snacks can\u2019t be more expensive than taking your family out to dinner.\n\nAnd why not get her the cake she wants and get your son the cupcake. It\u2019s not his birthday and he\u2019s the one with the issue.", "Mom, you\u2019re a major YTA. I can\u2019t believe you keep arguing in the comments and can\u2019t realize that. I hope you\u2019re a troll and this isn\u2019t real but as a divorce and custody attorney I\u2019m very familiar with how common this is. It\u2019s not about being unable to afford a party or a tablet. It\u2019s about you being resentful of what her father can afford to get her and you being spiteful towards your daughter who has a lot of feelings as a teenager where her younger siblings are clearly being favored over her, as demonstrated by your comments. Family counseling may be able to help if you actually care about repairing this relationship, otherwise expect her resentment of you to continue to grow and last for the rest of her life. What\u2019s next- you can\u2019t go to her high school graduation because little brother has a little league game?", "YTA it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s birthday, not your son\u2019s, so she gets the cake she wants. He can miss cake or he can get a cupcake. And pick up take out Indian for her and you eat fast food. I can understand the tablet may be out of budget, but the other two requests are so easy.", "YTA you made her birthday about everyone else but her.", "Jeez, this brings me back to my childhood. If this is normally how it is, your child will probably be traumatized. YTA.", "YTA. You can\u2019t get her the cake she wants because someone else is allergic to it? Why can\u2019t her brother just not eat cake or have something else for him? \n\nI grew up with years of having the \u201cfamily\u2019s fav cake\u201d for every birthday for anyone. I\u2019ve never liked it, so as I got older they started getting the cake for the family and me a slice of something else, even on my birthday. I love my family, but I still hate birthdays.", "YTA\n\nYou can't afford a party, that's fine. But you refusing to buy her choice of cake, and a birthday meal is ridiculous. And I've seen tablets on Amazon on less than $100, and I've seen Samsung tablets for under $150. \n\nSince your son is allergic to peanut butter, you buy \\*him\\* the cupcake, and you buy your daughter the cake \\*she\\* wants.", "She's being rude and sulky as teenagers can be, and refusing to understand the financial reality you are experiencing and I can understand your frustration with that.\n\nBut you *could* give her ONE of the 3 things she asked for pretty easily, and two wouldn't be that hard.\n\nIt's her birthday. YTA \n\nI imagine her brother can cope with not eating some of the cake this one time, and you could get him a cupcake alongside her main cake. Of course you need to be careful on cross-contamination.\n\nAnd you can get her Indian food and something else for everyone else or they can find one bloody thing on the menu they will eat, for goodness sake.", "YTA.\n\n>I told her we can\u2019t afford a birthday party this year instead we can buy a cake, a gift, and go oht for dinner\n\nSo you can\u2019t afford to throw her a party and refuse to get the things she did ask for for her birthday?\n\n>I told her she is being unreasonable, she knows her brother is allergic to peanut butter, I even offer to buy her a cupcake instead but she insisted on having a cake so I said fine, you are getting a chocolate cake then\n\nWhat does her brother being allergic to the cake have to do with anything? Isn\u2019t this HER birthday? To include your son, get HIM the cupcake and let your daughter have the cake she wants.\n\nOP what is the point of you saying she can have these three things if it won\u2019t be what she actually wants. You told her she can have a cake but the cake she wanted didn\u2019t meet your approval. She told you the literal ONE gift she want but you apparently can\u2019t afford it. She wants to go out for Indian food but because you nor her siblings like Indian food, you make her get fast food instead. This doesn\u2019t sound like a great birthday for her nor does it sound like you\u2019re trying to give her a great birthday", "YTA\n\n   Not for not being able to afford a party or tablet but for prioritizing everyone else over her on HER birthday. Its one day. I thought it was pretty common for people to do what the birthday person wants to do, even if they may not enjoy it. You, on the other hand, made the birthday girl do all the compromising. Why did you even bother telling her she could pick anything.  \n\n  Her brother could have gotten a cupcake and and she could have gotten a smaller peanut butter cake so everyone else got one piece with no leftovers and then it got cleaned up super well so allergic brother was safe. \n\n  And everyone else could have sucked it up and ate indian food for one night. Chinese was my favorite as a teenager and my parents didnt like it but they always made sure I got it for my birthday. \n\nThe food should have been a pretty simple ask for her birthday but you didnt seem to care at all about what she wanted. I would have left too. Hopefully Dad takes her out for a nice indian dinner.", "YTA. Your daughter shouldn't have thrown a tantrum, but based on your post and responses it sounds like you don't really give her many options even if you like to pretend that you do.\n\nPresenting options that aren't real options is a horrible thing to do. You told her she could have a cake, but then dictated what kind of cake it would be. You told her she could have a gift, but then dictated what that gift would be. You told her she could choose to have a birthday dinner then dictated what that dinner would be.\n\nAnd now you're upset that she wants to be away from you?\n\nIt's not a matter of being ungrateful. You gave her the illusion of choice and then decided that her choices don't matter. You really need to work on communicating with her, because it's entirely possible that she doesn't know what your budget is.", "INFO: \n\nWhat we\u2019re your other children\u2019s birthdays like?

Because if you did then YTA", "Neither you nor her siblings eat ANY Indian food? Indian food isn't just curry. There's a huge range of options- heck some restaurants will also do an omelette for those who refuse to eat any Indian food.

Get your 4-year old a cupcake and you can you without.  You can suck it up for one night and have Indian food.  Don\u2019t be surprised if your daughter avoids spending time with you as soon as she is able to.", "YTA. Why offer her a cake, gift, and dinner if you were going to shoot down every choice she made? For her sake, couldn\u2019t you choke down a meal at the restaurant she chose? Don\u2019t be surprised if she leaves as soon as she can and never comes back.", "Edited from e s h to YTA from your comments\n\nYou need to set reasonable expectations for your child. There are a few things here\n\n1. What kind of birthday party does she want? I am certain you could have a low key celebration at home for the same cost as a dinner out for your whole family.\n2. I get that one of your kids is allergic. Why couldn\u2019t she have her peanut butter cake and your son get an allergen safe cupcake?\n3. Totally reasonable that a tablet is not in the budget. Tell her what the budget is so she can make a reasonable request.  There is a wide difference between a tablet and a phone case\n4. You\u2019re an asshole for not taking her for Indian food. On your other kids birthdays they can choose what they want, and on hers they can suck it up and have some chicken and rice. There are options on an Indian menu that are suitable for picky eaters", "Yta- what\u2019s the point of doing something for her when it has to revolve around everybody else\u2019s needs? \n\nI\u2019m glad she has her father to go to.", "YTA\n\nSorry its not like you aren't able to but you don't want to. I get not throwing a whole party because of the money. This is fair. Same as getting her a tablet which is expensive. Maybe you could have thought of something better than a phone case but it is not the worst.\n\nWhat makes you an AH is not giving her the basic things that she wants and you can afford. You should give her the peanut butter cake and a cupcake for your son. If you are worried that he will want the cake instead then make his cupcake fancier so he feels its the best one can get, like put a small candle with a truck as decoration on it or whatever it is he likes. He is 4, its not that hard to impress him with is cupcake. \n\nAnd absolutely give her Indian food. I guess she doesn't get it often since your family doesn't like it. So now that its her birthday let her finally have, doesn't matter if you like it. Suck it up and get the best you can get from it while she actually gets to enjoy some of her birthday.", "YTA.

How much did you spend on that?", "YTA.\n\nThe tablet, I get it you can't afford it. The cake? You can easily get it for her instead of chocolate and it's cheap. Indian food? Absolutely something that you can do, it's her birthday. Suck it up and eat the food for one time. You are setting a precedent that her wishes don't matter to you. As per your comments on other threads, if you can buy a cupcake of peanut butter without any worry of your son, you can buy the cake too. Your daughter should get the cake she loves, doesn't matter if the family likes it or not.", "Are you willing to learn here?  YTA.   She is a teenager, and she sounds hard to deal with, but you asked about you. Her tantrum over party must have been unpleasant, and perhaps you need to deal  with that.  Does she always throw tantrums?  What is your response to this behavior.  Maybe you can read some,parenting books .  How to talk so children listen and how to listen so children talk was helpful. You are able to give her the birthday she wants, just not the gifts.  You Can offer PB cake with a chocolate cupcake.   Or PB cake after 4 year old goes to bed, with coffee or tea to emphasize more refined taste of older people.   Buy naan at Indian food and eat that if you really can\u2019t stand Indian food.   Let her have some choices and victories", "ESH\n\nTotally fine for you to not be able to afford a tablet or birthday party and she shouldn\u2019t be throwing tantrums over not getting them. \n\nBut it\u2019s her birthday so she should get the type of cake and dinner she wants.

And you and your siblings can work to expand your palates and find something you can eat at an Indian place.", "YTA.\n\nShe is getting nothing for her birthday. Everything that's supposed to be for her is catering someone else.\n\n\nSuggestion: Take her out to dinner.  Just the 2 of you. That way she can eat food without others complaining.

She's not getting a single thing she wants for her birthday and your response is to accuse her of having tantrums. \n\nShe doesn't get a party. She doesn't get the cake she wants. She gets a cheap phone case. And you're not even letting her choose where her birthday meal will be. \n\nCouldn't you have found a compromise?

Her siblings can suck it up and just eat the food. Her brother can be the one to get a cupcake. You essentially took her birthday away from her and made it about her siblings.\n\nShe sucks in that she isn't grateful for the gift and is insisting on the tablet knowing you can't afford it.

A few pizzas, movies, games, maybe manicure items, depending on what she likes, could be a party. Of course, she may have had something much grander in mind. \n\nHonestly, your daughter sounds a bit bratty. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted here but is it a coincidence her favorite cake is what her brother is allergic to? I\u2019ve never once laid eyes on a peanut butter cake. How allergic is he?

Yes, your daughter had a fit when you first told her money was tight and the offered other options for what she wanted.  Then when she asked for certain things, you basically said no to all of them.

Oh my fucking god.  Get it through your thick skull that birthdays are supposed to celebrate the birthday PERSON.  It's not to celebrate and appease the needs and wants of every other family member.

Look up some Indian food recipes.  It's really not that difficult plus you can even measure the recipe to make exactly enough for one person.  Do you even like this kid?

I understand not being able to afford the gift but you could have given her a budget. The cake could have been gotten and eaten once the 4 year old went to bed. The dinner could have been done and you find something on the menu. It's not difficult.

Telling him \"no\" and trusting him to just listen is a terrible way to protect your kid. At that age, he probably doesn't even understand that he's allergic or the magnitude of the consequences if he does eat it. It seems like you think 4 year olds can understand complex topics like adults can. They can't. Which is why it is up to the parents to protect them. \n\nYou're sending your child to someone else's house without you? Then you, as an adult, should inform the other child's parents, another adult, that your child cannot have peanuts. If you cannot trust that adult to keep peanuts away from your FOUR YEAR OLD CHILD (who CANNOT make responsible choices because of his age) then you should not send your child to that house. \n\nYes, at some point they will need to learn that they cannot eat peanuts because they are allergic, but they simply cannot fully understand this at that age. And if your only protection of them is telling them no and trusting them to listen, then you shouldn't be a parent because that is a TERRIBLE precaution. Completely insufficient. You need to telling them no IN ADDITION to keeping them away from dangerous things whenever possible because the reality is that children can and will disobey their parents, especially at such a young age.\n\nETA: And as far and storing the cake- kids get into things they're not suppose to. They climb on counters, they break things open, they do whatever just because they're kids. Even more so if they a know a cake is up there.", "Has every single four year old listened to you every time you've told them no? You've never once had a child disobey you? All the kids in your life are perfectly well behaved and have never ever done something they're not supposed to?\n\nIf your answer for those questions is \"no,\" (which is probably is) then why would you rely them always listening as the only precaution to protecting your child's health and potentially their life?\n\nETA: if you could just trust your kid to listen then why would people lock up guns, medicine, and chemical cleaners so their kids can't get to it? Do you leave these items out for your children and just trust them not to play with or consume then because you told them not to? All these items can be as dangerous to a child as an allergen.", "Movie and game night are both good party ideas-", "How?? Just put the cake in the fridge high up. Four year olds are short from what I understand. Mom could also, like, watch the four year old and if he starts trying to eat cake stop him.", "Who said that\u2019s the only precaution? She\u2019s perfectly capable of keeping the cake out of his reach. As you would do with\u2026.. any cake?", "Putting the cake in the fridge is essentially \u201clocking it up\u201d.
