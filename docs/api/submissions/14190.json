I would not be forcing her to pay my extremely expensive cleaning bill because I'm not able to handle my own obsessive thoughts.", "Info, I understand you have OCD. Not judging you for that. However wouldn't a better solution be have O clean up the mess. It was foot prints and crumbs. Seems like an easy clean.", "YTA, this is an absurd overreaction. She left some crumbs and had shoes on. Tell her to mop the floors and clear up the crumbs. OCD is not an excuse to act like a jerk when a teenager behaves like a totally normal teenager.", "YTA. Dramatic much? \u201cShe ruined my house.\u201d With a few crumbs? Because unless her friends were trudging around in the mud, they wouldn\u2019t be leaving visible dirt on your floors. You have the ridiculously high cleaning \u201cstandards\u201d and overreact to small messes. How do I know this? Because you exaggerate even in this post. Therefore you need to stop holding other people responsible for meeting that standard (to the point where they have to practically walk on eggshells in their own home to placate you), and cough up the money yourself if it\u2019s so damn important to you. You\u2019re prioritizing this petty issue over your relationship with your stepdaughter, do you really want to be THAT stepmother?", "Footprints in your house and pizza crumbs do not make a house \u201cfilthy.\u201d You had plenty of options other than charging your step daughter - you could\u2019ve cleaned it, your husband could\u2019ve, you could have asked her to clean it, etc. \n\nYTA. Telling your step daughter she ruined your house is a sure fire way to ruin your relationship with her.", "YTA for calling your house 'ruined' for a fairly easily cleanable mess.\n\nShe should have cleaned it. Because you're not the one who usually disciplines (and this is obviously an issue for you and between the two of you), you should have told her father to enforce that.\n\nOf course her friends should have taken their shoes off. Of course your stepdaughter needs to clean up after herself (and her friends). But she's not an AH for living and sometimes leaving some mess.\n\n'Ruined' implies actual damage. A mess is a mess, not damage. You're overreacting.", "Her friend have been over before and never had a problem? Were they out in the mud or something to make the carpet that hard to clean?\n\nIt seems like this is VERY out of the blue. It'd be one thing to tell her to clean up the mess. It's another to just spring a massive bill on a college student. Can she even afford to cover it?\n\nYou said she could trust you, come to you, etc. but yet you seem to have no calmness or understanding about one mess (and have up to this point failed to correct the issue).\n\nWhat are we missing? You've had kids and teenagers around the house, it would seem it's likely that something like this would've happened before. Footprints in the carpet seems the worst offense, but unless they were tracking mud, I can't see how it could've made such a mess (an expensive mess at that) so quickly.\n\nGonna go with YTA for now.", "YTA. \n\nIt was footprints and crumbs and possibly some other small messes. That is not damages nor is it hard to just ask her to clean it. Nothing was ruined. Nothing was permanently scarred. \n\nYou have children, three of them. Children, even teenage children, leave small messes. This is something you need to be working on for yourself, your husband and the kids. \n\nThis was an easy fix and you chose the most difficult and confrontational way to handle it.", "Yta she didn\u2019t put holes in the walls or break anything, footprints and crumbs are so easy to clean but instead of asking her to do it you choose the most childish thing without any warning", "YTA. The punishment should fit the crime. Cleaning shoeprints and crumbs would not equal what you paid for the cleaning service. They left shoe prints all over the house? Did they walk thru mud before walking in the doorway? I get it, I have OCD too, and am becoming more symptomatic as I get older. But here's the thing. You don't live alone. You share your home with multiple people. It's reasonable to expect people to clean up after themselves. But it's not reasonable to expect them to clean it the way you would. I'd tell her to clean her crap up. There's no discussion. If you can't leave it the way you found it, then you won't be allowed to have friends over. Very basic, simple terms.

Making a college-age student pay you back a couple hundred dollars in recompense for damage they caused (or indirectly caused by inviting friends over and letting them make a mess of the place) is theoretically reasonable. But if you're asking her to pay like 5 or 6 hundred dollars, that's probably too much of a consequence for the severity of the mistake.", "INFO: does your weekly cleaner charge the same amount every week or was it more because of the mess your stepdaughter and her friends (may have) made?", "ESH\n\nInstead of just demanding money you should have talked to her, explained the issue and asked her to clean up after her friends. Tell her if it happens again, she will be responsible for the cleaning bill. But to just jump right to demanding money is a bit much.

Yes, she\u2019s not going to get it as clean as your cleaners. But that\u2019s life with kids. Things get messy. Please work on getting treatment for your OCD, because I feel like you are creating an environment where your kids live in fear of your reaction if this is your response to a normal situation with kids having friends over.

I suspect that the overtime you\u2019re working means you\u2019re under a lot more stress, and that stress is making your OCD and sense of control over things much worse, and it needs an outlet which is why you\u2019re overreacting to a very minor mess. I mean, something that only qualifies as someone else who lives in your house existing, and you have no right to make the children you live with feel terrified for merely existing and living within their own home. I think you need to take a massive step back here and ask yourself if this is really about some crumbs and foot prints or if it\u2019s about you being at a level of stress that you\u2019re about to snap. Or, honestly, have already snapped and vented your emotional problems on your stepdaughter and damaged your relationship with her. I suggest you need therapy, or a vacation, or some other method to blow off steam and cool down, knowing that if you\u2019ve been working really hard you do deserve and need this self care. And it\u2019s possible that hiring the cleaning service was your self care, and your stepdaughter and her friends marred or \u201cruined\u201d it before you came home, thus why you\u2019re so upset.

She should have cleaned the counter and made sure she and her guests took off their shoes.\n\nThat being said, your response was extreme and out of the blue, so much that it overshadows her assholery. A natural consequence would be insisting that she vacuums, mops the floor, and cleans the counter, then perhaps warning her that if she doesn\u2019t remember to clean up after her guests, you\u2019ll charge her $20 or something reasonable for reminding her to do so. Mental illness is really tough, but frankly the way she left the house was \u201cmessy\u201d or \u201cuntidy\u201d but not even close to \u201cruined.\u201d If a normal, non-professional can\u2019t reach your cleaning standards , your cleaning standards are far too high.", "YTA and you're working hard towards destroying your relationship with O", "Crumbs on the counter and footprints are not damages and your youse isn't ruined.\n\nYTA.

One of the things that is hardest is figuring out if we should try to control the thing. We both know the demand isn't logical from our minds. \n\nSome thoughts because of experience? Do you classify this service as medical care? If not? See if you can get some support if you have access to insurance. \n\nHave you told O that you need her to clean up after these moments and that you feel your space is violated? If not? She cannot change her behavior. If so? You need to do it again with your partners \n\nIs the house actually trashed or is it not precise? This is where the calling your therapist if you have access bit comes in because triggers for things make logic and nuance hard. It's not sounding trashed but not perfect and perfect doesn't exist and isn't attainable. I know it's stressing you out but if it's unreasonable as it sounds on my end this demand will harm your relationship with O so my final thought is NTA if you had the conversation with her and if you decide not based on OCD but what you want from your relationship with O and can live with the outcome of that choice. Right or wrong? If you cannot live with the consequences it's a bad idea. Right isn't as simple as OCD makes my brain demand it be which is one of the hardest parts for me personally", "NTA.  \n\nHaving to pay the cleaners money and then O making a mess an hour after the house being cleaned is very disrespectful (assuming she knew the house was cleaned).

She\u2019s an adult now and needs to take responsibility. I think telling her she has to pay if she\u2019s made a mess after the cleaner has come is fair but I think allowing her to clean is a better solution. She clearly lacks some domestic skills so getting her into the habit of cleaning now will benefit her massively even if it\u2019s not to the high standard you prefer.

It's crumbs and foot prints. It's a low bar to clean.", "It sounds like your cleanliness standards are extreme. \n\nAre you seeking help for your OCD?", "No, you think you would need to redo it. It's a mop and a paper towel or a Clorox wipe. That's it. It is about 2 minutes of cleaning. Something an 18 year old is very capable of doing. Even your 10 year old could handle it. \n\nYou are making your issues the household issues instead of dealing with them. You are punishing an 18 year old financially because of those same issues. It is time you did some self reflection on how your standards and reactions and going to affect your relationships.", "No, you wouldn't *have* to do that. You're making O literally pay for your mental illness. It is a perfectly normal thing to have friends over and to *gasp* have the mess the comes with actually living in a house. Have O clean up after herself, because that's what normal people do in the house they live in. Everything else, like paying for a cleaner because you're mentally ill, is your responsibility. YTA", "What is your level of ideal clean? I have to agree with the others here and suggest you may have OCD. Look into this further, as you are being irrational in your decision making here in ways that may be harmful to your relationships.", "Then it's not really about the mess. It's more about O. It really sounds like you're upset she had friends over and it's manifesting into your fear of dirtiness.", "Then her punishment is for her to clean it, and if you need it somehow cleaner than that, you do it or pay for that, her job is to pick up her own messes, but not to soothe your OCD.", "But that's your neurosis in action. If you need the place kept to a ridiculous standard such that normal everyday activities (walking, eating) trigger claims of property damage and threats of legal action, you need help.", "This wouldn\u2019t be a reasonable way to treat a full adult either. If you share your home with others sometimes there will be small messes you aren\u2019t happy about. Asking her to clean it up and reminding her about the no shoes rule is reasonable. Demanding payment is not.", "What the fuck?", "She is barely 18. you don't get to suddenly decide she's an adult because she had a birthday.", "Your standards are too extreme. You\u2019re ruining your relationship with your stepdaughter by telling her she ruined your home. Her father disagrees with you\u2014you\u2019re out of line. \n\nPlease seek professional help for your OCD.", "This is coming from someone currently in treatment for OCD: Your OCD is your problem. You cannot hold people to your very unreasonable standards. Having her clean her (very minor) mess is the only reasonable course of action here.", "If crumbs and footprints bother you this much then you should be seeing a counselor to manage your OCD.", "Stop putting your insane childhood issues onto your step daughter.", "Have you ever considered that maybe the \u201cvery strict\u201d standards you were oppressed by as a child has created anxiety and neuroses you\u2019ve carried well into adulthood and are now revisiting on your children to the same detrimental result?  Could it be that you should want better for your kids than to recreate all the exacting that got you to this point?\n\nYou have two pre-teen boys. If you think they aren\u2019t going to create crumbs or be messy (or aren\u2019t already), especially when they inevitably bring friends over, then you are in for a very rude awakening in a few smelly years.  You\u2019ll either be in a fugue state from the chaos or have children who spend all their time at ANYONE else\u2019s house but with you at yours. Which may be your goal, but it seems like a really hands off way to parent and sort of keeps all the shitty parts with none of the loving, bonding parts. \n\nAnd I REALLY hope that this isn\u2019t JUST directed at your step daughter because - again - you have two preteen boys who ALSO cause messes and can be careless/forgetful. Are you fining them, as well?", "I'm currently in treatment for OCD, I would not treat someone this way and I would not call crumbs and shoe marks \"damage\" to the house. Damage is if she threw a party and her guests damaged the paint or ripped your carpet or gouged your hard floors.\n\nFirst, if the solution of asking her to clean the mess she made (to reasonable standards that don't include sterilization, multiple extra steps, cleaning an additional area that is clean due to routine preference or concerns of contamination that are rooted in paranoia or fear) isn't acceptable to you, then it's a you problem.\nSecond, it's her house too, don't forget that.\nThird, i recognize how difficult this mental health issues is for you, I really do, but the longer you live with this and don't seek treatment, the more your life will spiral and you will cause irreparable damage in either driving your kids away, or passing on this difficult disorder onto them along with all the suffering, emotional torture, and feelings of incompleteness it brings. Go get treatment, you want and OCD specialist and the wait list can be long, go sign up now.", "You have to contend with reconciling your own expectations of cleanliness with reality. That\u2019s *your* job because they\u2019re *your* standards which may or may not be realistic (in this case they clearly aren\u2019t). Your standards aren\u2019t objectively right nor is everyone else wrong about theirs.\n\n\nYou can decide to outsource the cleaning and you can set the expectations for your hired help. If you\u2019re setting the expectations unanimously and without compromise or discussion then it\u2019s your responsibility to clean and/or pay for those standards to be met.", "U really hate her dont u", "Going against the entire set of responses here, there's no reason to pile onto OP because as she states, she pays for a higher level of cleaning because of her OCD and she works hard to maintain her house at a certain level.  Her step daughter, who needs to have a basic level of respect when she brings guests over should be adhering to some basic rules.  I really have no clue as to why in the world it's gotten to be such a horrible attitude to hold young adults responsible to other people's property by cleaning up after themselves and expect others to clean it up.", "Did you ask her why she didn't clean up after herself this time?", "So the answer is, no, she had no warning of the consequences. For that, YTA.", "So\u2026 talking to her was crossing a boundary but venmo\u2019ing her wasn\u2019t? Er\u2026.", "Were you actually charged extra for the footprints and crumbs?  And did you ask your stepdaughter to pay you the difference or the whole cost?", "For crumbs and footprints? Especially given how obsessive you are about cleaning...get real, there's no way they charged extra for something that small.", "Yeah I read that part wrong", "My mistake I read that part wrong, Still voting ESH, She's old enough to know to clean after herself or guests that she invites", "I meant completely reasonable in wanting her sd to take responsibility as I literally explained in the post. She has a disorder that causes literal pain when things are out of order but I literally said she has to compromise and allow her SD to clean to a normal extent and not the high standard she wants.", "That works too. I guess I assumed that \u201cO\u201d is refusing to clean up because she asserted that *she* didn\u2019t make the mess, but I suppose it\u2019s possible that \u201cO\u201d was never even asked to clean up after her guests.", "Seriously, does it require more than a quick mop and a wet paper towel on the counter?", "So sorry, there was confusion in the story but the mess was made after cleaners came.", "I am, it has been helping but I definitely still need more time to fully figure out how to manage it.", "?", "No, I expect all the kids to be able to clean up after themselves unless there was an emergency of some kind which there wasn\u2019t.  She\u2019s an adult and I\u2019ve been trying to treat her like one more.", "Sorry, seems there confusion with the story.  The cleaners came around 10am and finished at 2pm.  O and her friends came in around 3pm and left 5pm.  I wasn\u2019t charged the difference because the mess wasn\u2019t there yet.", "Sorry my bad, if there\u2019s like physically mess they have to pick up and throw away then yes there\u2019s extra charge but other than that it\u2019s the set price.", "From what I can tell OP doesn't have faith in O's ability to clean.", "If you wanna get crazy use some disinfectant for the counter to avoid ants.", "I\u2019m glad to hear you are getting help, but sending your step daughter a Venmo bill is not an appropriate way to handle this. Your OCD is not your fault, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. But I promise you, you\u2019re going to do harm to your relationship with O if you keep behaving this way.\n\nFootprints and some crumbs shouldn\u2019t take more than 5-10 minutes to clean.", "Just to be clear, the first communication you had with her about the mess that she\u2019d made was the payment request?", "They charge extra for whisking away some crumbs? You're getting taken advantage of. You need a new cleaner, friend.", "That could be. It\u2019s hard to tell if O does a half-ass job of cleaning up by a reasonable person\u2019s standard (and OP is being a bit self-deprecating by calling herself OCD) or if the OP has unreasonable cleanliness standards.", "Once again, sorry seems there might be confusion with the story. The cleaners came at 10am and left 2pm.  O and her friends came at 3pm and left 5pm.  There wasn\u2019t extra charge because the crumbs weren\u2019t there when the cleaners came beforehand.", "I think the fact that OP described the house as \"ruined\" makes it pretty easy to determine the answer to that.", "So why did she have to pay at all if you didn't need the cleaners to re-clean?", "Idk. I can see myself using that kind of language if my 18yo and her friends muddied the floors and left my countertops gross *immediately* following an expensive housecleaning."]}
