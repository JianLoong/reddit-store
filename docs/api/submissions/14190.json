I would not be forcing her to pay my extremely expensive cleaning bill because I'm not able to handle my own obsessive thoughts.", "Info, I understand you have OCD. Not judging you for that. However wouldn't a better solution be have O clean up the mess. It was foot prints and crumbs. Seems like an easy clean.", "YTA, this is an absurd overreaction. She left some crumbs and had shoes on. Tell her to mop the floors and clear up the crumbs. OCD is not an excuse to act like a jerk when a teenager behaves like a totally normal teenager.", "YTA. Dramatic much? \u201cShe ruined my house.\u201d With a few crumbs? Because unless her friends were trudging around in the mud, they wouldn\u2019t be leaving visible dirt on your floors. You have the ridiculously high cleaning \u201cstandards\u201d and overreact to small messes. How do I know this? Because you exaggerate even in this post. Therefore you need to stop holding other people responsible for meeting that standard (to the point where they have to practically walk on eggshells in their own home to placate you), and cough up the money yourself if it\u2019s so damn important to you. You\u2019re prioritizing this petty issue over your relationship with your stepdaughter, do you really want to be THAT stepmother?", "Footprints in your house and pizza crumbs do not make a house \u201cfilthy.\u201d You had plenty of options other than charging your step daughter - you could\u2019ve cleaned it, your husband could\u2019ve, you could have asked her to clean it, etc. \n\nYTA. Telling your step daughter she ruined your house is a sure fire way to ruin your relationship with her.", "YTA for calling your house 'ruined' for a fairly easily cleanable mess.\n\nShe should have cleaned it. Because you're not the one who usually disciplines (and this is obviously an issue for you and between the two of you), you should have told her father to enforce that.\n\nOf course her friends should have taken their shoes off. Of course your stepdaughter needs to clean up after herself (and her friends). But she's not an AH for living and sometimes leaving some mess.\n\n'Ruined' implies actual damage. A mess is a mess, not damage. You're overreacting.", "Her friend have been over before and never had a problem? Were they out in the mud or something to make the carpet that hard to clean?\n\nIt seems like this is VERY out of the blue. It'd be one thing to tell her to clean up the mess. It's another to just spring a massive bill on a college student. Can she even afford to cover it?\n\nYou said she could trust you, come to you, etc. but yet you seem to have no calmness or understanding about one mess (and have up to this point failed to correct the issue).\n\nWhat are we missing? You've had kids and teenagers around the house, it would seem it's likely that something like this would've happened before. Footprints in the carpet seems the worst offense, but unless they were tracking mud, I can't see how it could've made such a mess (an expensive mess at that) so quickly.\n\nGonna go with YTA for now.", "YTA. \n\nIt was footprints and crumbs and possibly some other small messes. That is not damages nor is it hard to just ask her to clean it. Nothing was ruined. Nothing was permanently scarred. \n\nYou have children, three of them. Children, even teenage children, leave small messes. This is something you need to be working on for yourself, your husband and the kids. \n\nThis was an easy fix and you chose the most difficult and confrontational way to handle it.", "Yta she didn\u2019t put holes in the walls or break anything, footprints and crumbs are so easy to clean but instead of asking her to do it you choose the most childish thing without any warning", "YTA. The punishment should fit the crime. Cleaning shoeprints and crumbs would not equal what you paid for the cleaning service. They left shoe prints all over the house? Did they walk thru mud before walking in the doorway? I get it, I have OCD too, and am becoming more symptomatic as I get older. But here's the thing. You don't live alone. You share your home with multiple people. It's reasonable to expect people to clean up after themselves. But it's not reasonable to expect them to clean it the way you would. I'd tell her to clean her crap up. There's no discussion. If you can't leave it the way you found it, then you won't be allowed to have friends over. Very basic, simple terms.

Making a college-age student pay you back a couple hundred dollars in recompense for damage they caused (or indirectly caused by inviting friends over and letting them make a mess of the place) is theoretically reasonable. But if you're asking her to pay like 5 or 6 hundred dollars, that's probably too much of a consequence for the severity of the mistake.", "INFO: does your weekly cleaner charge the same amount every week or was it more because of the mess your stepdaughter and her friends (may have) made?", "ESH\n\nInstead of just demanding money you should have talked to her, explained the issue and asked her to clean up after her friends. Tell her if it happens again, she will be responsible for the cleaning bill. But to just jump right to demanding money is a bit much.

Yes, she\u2019s not going to get it as clean as your cleaners. But that\u2019s life with kids. Things get messy. Please work on getting treatment for your OCD, because I feel like you are creating an environment where your kids live in fear of your reaction if this is your response to a normal situation with kids having friends over.

I suspect that the overtime you\u2019re working means you\u2019re under a lot more stress, and that stress is making your OCD and sense of control over things much worse, and it needs an outlet which is why you\u2019re overreacting to a very minor mess. I mean, something that only qualifies as someone else who lives in your house existing, and you have no right to make the children you live with feel terrified for merely existing and living within their own home. I think you need to take a massive step back here and ask yourself if this is really about some crumbs and foot prints or if it\u2019s about you being at a level of stress that you\u2019re about to snap. Or, honestly, have already snapped and vented your emotional problems on your stepdaughter and damaged your relationship with her. I suggest you need therapy, or a vacation, or some other method to blow off steam and cool down, knowing that if you\u2019ve been working really hard you do deserve and need this self care. And it\u2019s possible that hiring the cleaning service was your self care, and your stepdaughter and her friends marred or \u201cruined\u201d it before you came home, thus why you\u2019re so upset.

She should have cleaned the counter and made sure she and her guests took off their shoes.\n\nThat being said, your response was extreme and out of the blue, so much that it overshadows her assholery. A natural consequence would be insisting that she vacuums, mops the floor, and cleans the counter, then perhaps warning her that if she doesn\u2019t remember to clean up after her guests, you\u2019ll charge her $20 or something reasonable for reminding her to do so. Mental illness is really tough, but frankly the way she left the house was \u201cmessy\u201d or \u201cuntidy\u201d but not even close to \u201cruined.\u201d If a normal, non-professional can\u2019t reach your cleaning standards , your cleaning standards are far too high.", "YTA and you're working hard towards destroying your relationship with O", "Crumbs on the counter and footprints are not damages and your house isn't ruined.\n\nYTA.

One of the things that is hardest is figuring out if we should try to control the thing. We both know the demand isn't logical from our minds. \n\nSome thoughts because of experience? Do you classify this service as medical care? If not? See if you can get some support if you have access to insurance. \n\nHave you told O that you need her to clean up after these moments and that you feel your space is violated? If not? She cannot change her behavior. If so? You need to do it again with your partners \n\nIs the house actually trashed or is it not precise? This is where the calling your therapist if you have access bit comes in because triggers for things make logic and nuance hard. It's not sounding trashed but not perfect and perfect doesn't exist and isn't attainable. I know it's stressing you out but if it's unreasonable as it sounds on my end this demand will harm your relationship with O so my final thought is NTA if you had the conversation with her and if you decide not based on OCD but what you want from your relationship with O and can live with the outcome of that choice. Right or wrong? If you cannot live with the consequences it's a bad idea. Right isn't as simple as OCD makes my brain demand it be which is one of the hardest parts for me personally", "NTA.  \n\nHaving to pay the cleaners money and then O making a mess an hour after the house being cleaned is very disrespectful (assuming she knew the house was cleaned).

She\u2019s an adult now and needs to take responsibility. I think telling her she has to pay if she\u2019s made a mess after the cleaner has come is fair but I think allowing her to clean is a better solution. She clearly lacks some domestic skills so getting her into the habit of cleaning now will benefit her massively even if it\u2019s not to the high standard you prefer.

If a 3 year old dumps a glass of milk over, you have them get paper towels and wipe it up, even if it's not perfect. OP wants their children to be responsible for their messes and cleaning up after themselves but children who are constantly told they aren't doing it right either stop caring and won't do it because nothing is ever good enough or they get driven to unhealthy anxiety and obsession like OP.  \n\nStepdaughter should've been told she needed to clean up the mess this time, and be warned in the future if her friends and her \"damage\" the cleaners work (aka live in the house like its a home) and make a mess directly after the cleaner comes then she will be responsible for paying for the next week's cleaning service. But y'know in a healthy way like \"I know you guys were just having fun which is important for you and your friends. To me it's important that I can fully experience and enjoy the cleaning service I pay for at least on the day it happens, which is why I'm a little upset there are footprints and messy counters, but I know it wasn't done on purpose. Because you and your friends made those messes, it is your responsibility to clean them up by tomorrow afternoon. \"X\" is the day the cleaners usually come, and in the future I would really appreciate if you guys could either go out on those days or find a non messy activity if you guys end up hanging out here on that day. Should you and your friends choose to make a mess directly after the cleaners come in the future and leave messes around, I will then ask you to pay for the next cleaning service because while this is a home and messes will happen, I have now explained that getting to experience this one night of super clean, mess free house is important to me.\" \n\nOP, I understand your frustration at wanting a clean house and asking to have one night of super clean house isn't a lot, but you need to really reconsider your definition of damaging and destroying things if crumbs and footprints are catastrophic damage. I thought you were gonna say your stepdaughter threw a rager by the title. You're clearly suffering trauma from your own childhood filled with impossibly difficult standards to meet. Maybe you should consider talking with your therapist about working on exposure therapy to learn to be okay with what are considering normal everyday messes in home."]}
