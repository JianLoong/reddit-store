My husband and I dated for 3 years prior to getting married but moved in all together 2 years ago.  \n\nO lives with us full time and it had a bit of a rocky start with mine and O\u2019s relationship but we managed to push through it.  I told O from day one that I wasn\u2019t her mom but if there was anything she wants to talk about or need, she can come to me.  After a few months, we became quite close and she talked to me about anything she was too embarrassed to talk about with her dad.\n\nRecently, O has been trying to make friends at College since she just started in the spring.  On campus residence is very expensive for the college and its close to our house so O decided to stay at home. That\u2019s not a problem, the problem is that O keeps bringing her friends over to hangout but living it a mess.  \n\nNormally it\u2019s not a major deal (I have OCD so sometimes there is issues depending on the situation though) because she picks up after herself but I recently hired a housekeeper to clean the house once a week since I\u2019ve been working overtime more often and me and my husband just don\u2019t have time.  It is expensive but I cannot stand it when it becomes too messy for me so I think it\u2019s worth it.  \n\nThis time she brought her friends over after the house was cleaned and I guess they decided not take their shoes off and walked all around the house leaving footprints.  They also made pizza from scratch and left the crumbles on the counters among other things.  They pretty much made the entire house filthy before I could even come home. \n\nOnce again, the cleaning service is quite expensive because I like a higher level of cleaning quality so I was pissed.  My husband is trying to make me let it go because O has always struggled making friends but I can\u2019t let it go because of how much it cost.  I requested the exact amount I paid for the cleaning service to her Venmo and she acted all confused on why she had to pay for it.  I explained that her and her friends ruined my house that was just cleaned but she insisted it wasn\u2019t her.\n\nI have a ring camera and I have video proof of her and her friends going into the house and they were the only ones home that day before me.  I gave her two choices, pay for the damages or I stop paying for her phone.  She\u2019s complaining saying it wasn\u2019t her and she doesn\u2019t have the money to pay the phone bill.

I would not be forcing her to pay my extremely expensive cleaning bill because I'm not able to handle my own obsessive thoughts.", "Info, I understand you have OCD. Not judging you for that. However wouldn't a better solution be have O clean up the mess. It was foot prints and crumbs. Seems like an easy clean.", "YTA, this is an absurd overreaction. She left some crumbs and had shoes on. Tell her to mop the floors and clear up the crumbs. OCD is not an excuse to act like a jerk when a teenager behaves like a totally normal teenager.", "YTA. Dramatic much? \u201cShe ruined my house.\u201d With a few crumbs? Because unless her friends were trudging around in the mud, they wouldn\u2019t be leaving visible dirt on your floors. You have the ridiculously high cleaning \u201cstandards\u201d and overreact to small messes. How do I know this? Because you exaggerate even in this post. Therefore you need to stop holding other people responsible for meeting that standard (to the point where they have to practically walk on eggshells in their own home to placate you), and cough up the money yourself if it\u2019s so damn important to you. You\u2019re prioritizing this petty issue over your relationship with your stepdaughter, do you really want to be THAT stepmother?", "Footprints in your house and pizza crumbs do not make a house \u201cfilthy.\u201d You had plenty of options other than charging your step daughter - you could\u2019ve cleaned it, your husband could\u2019ve, you could have asked her to clean it, etc. \n\nYTA. Telling your step daughter she ruined your house is a sure fire way to ruin your relationship with her.", "YTA for calling your house 'ruined' for a fairly easily cleanable mess.\n\nShe should have cleaned it. Because you're not the one who usually disciplines (and this is obviously an issue for you and between the two of you), you should have told her father to enforce that.\n\nOf course her friends should have taken their shoes off. Of course your stepdaughter needs to clean up after herself (and her friends). But she's not an AH for living and sometimes leaving some mess.\n\n'Ruined' implies actual damage. A mess is a mess, not damage. You're overreacting.", "Her friend have been over before and never had a problem? Were they out in the mud or something to make the carpet that hard to clean?\n\nIt seems like this is VERY out of the blue. It'd be one thing to tell her to clean up the mess. It's another to just spring a massive bill on a college student. Can she even afford to cover it?\n\nYou said she could trust you, come to you, etc. but yet you seem to have no calmness or understanding about one mess (and have up to this point failed to correct the issue).\n\nWhat are we missing? You've had kids and teenagers around the house, it would seem it's likely that something like this would've happened before. Footprints in the carpet seems the worst offense, but unless they were tracking mud, I can't see how it could've made such a mess (an expensive mess at that) so quickly.\n\nGonna go with YTA for now.", "YTA. \n\nIt was footprints and crumbs and possibly some other small messes. That is not damages nor is it hard to just ask her to clean it. Nothing was ruined. Nothing was permanently scarred. \n\nYou have children, three of them. Children, even teenage children, leave small messes. This is something you need to be working on for yourself, your husband and the kids. \n\nThis was an easy fix and you chose the most difficult and confrontational way to handle it.", "Yta she didn\u2019t put holes in the walls or break anything, footprints and crumbs are so easy to clean but instead of asking her to do it you choose the most childish thing without any warning", "YTA. The punishment should fit the crime. Cleaning shoeprints and crumbs would not equal what you paid for the cleaning service. They left shoe prints all over the house? Did they walk thru mud before walking in the doorway? I get it, I have OCD too, and am becoming more symptomatic as I get older. But here's the thing. You don't live alone. You share your home with multiple people. It's reasonable to expect people to clean up after themselves. But it's not reasonable to expect them to clean it the way you would. I'd tell her to clean her crap up. There's no discussion. If you can't leave it the way you found it, then you won't be allowed to have friends over. Very basic, simple terms. But her dad needs to be on the same page as you, otherwise you'll keep running into the same problems.", "YTA. Crumbs \u201cruined\u201d your house?! HAHAHAH Yeah naw, YTA", "YTA.

YTA", "If this is how you respond to footprints and crumbs, I feel sorry for the 10 and 12 year old - they must live in a state of constant vigilance not wanting to upset you.", "INFO: How expensive is \"quite expensive\"? Making a college-age student pay you back a couple hundred dollars in recompense for damage they caused (or indirectly caused by inviting friends over and letting them make a mess of the place) is theoretically reasonable. But if you're asking her to pay like 5 or 6 hundred dollars, that's probably too much of a consequence for the severity of the mistake.", "INFO: does your weekly cleaner charge the same amount every week or was it more because of the mess your stepdaughter and her friends (may have) made?", "ESH\n\nInstead of just demanding money you should have talked to her, explained the issue and asked her to clean up after her friends. Tell her if it happens again, she will be responsible for the cleaning bill. But to just jump right to demanding money is a bit much.

Yes, she\u2019s not going to get it as clean as your cleaners. But that\u2019s life with kids. Things get messy. Please work on getting treatment for your OCD, because I feel like you are creating an environment where your kids live in fear of your reaction if this is your response to a normal situation with kids having friends over. The default response would be to have them clean up their mess, not charge them for your expensive cleaner because you didn\u2019t get to appreciate your pristinely sterilized house before they ruined it by existing.", "YTA, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the message you need to receive here. I suspect that the overtime you\u2019re working means you\u2019re under a lot more stress, and that stress is making your OCD and sense of control over things much worse, and it needs an outlet which is why you\u2019re overreacting to a very minor mess. I mean, something that only qualifies as someone else who lives in your house existing, and you have no right to make the children you live with feel terrified for merely existing and living within their own home. I think you need to take a massive step back here and ask yourself if this is really about some crumbs and foot prints or if it\u2019s about you being at a level of stress that you\u2019re about to snap. Or, honestly, have already snapped and vented your emotional problems on your stepdaughter and damaged your relationship with her. I suggest you need therapy, or a vacation, or some other method to blow off steam and cool down, knowing that if you\u2019ve been working really hard you do deserve and need this self care. And it\u2019s possible that hiring the cleaning service was your self care, and your stepdaughter and her friends marred or \u201cruined\u201d it before you came home, thus why you\u2019re so upset.

She should have cleaned the counter and made sure she and her guests took off their shoes.\n\nThat being said, your response was extreme and out of the blue, so much that it overshadows her assholery. A natural consequence would be insisting that she vacuums, mops the floor, and cleans the counter, then perhaps warning her that if she doesn\u2019t remember to clean up after her guests, you\u2019ll charge her $20 or something reasonable for reminding her to do so. Mental illness is really tough, but frankly the way she left the house was \u201cmessy\u201d or \u201cuntidy\u201d but not even close to \u201cruined.\u201d If a normal, non-professional can\u2019t reach your cleaning standards , your cleaning standards are far too high.", "YTA and you're working hard towards destroying your relationship with O", "Crumbs on the counter and footprints are not damages and your house isn't ruined.\n\nYTA.

One of the things that is hardest is figuring out if we should try to control the thing. We both know the demand isn't logical from our minds. \n\nSome thoughts because of experience? Do you classify this service as medical care? If not? See if you can get some support if you have access to insurance. \n\nHave you told O that you need her to clean up after these moments and that you feel your space is violated? If not? She cannot change her behavior. If so? You need to do it again with your partners \n\nIs the house actually trashed or is it not precise? This is where the calling your therapist if you have access bit comes in because triggers for things make logic and nuance hard. It's not sounding trashed but not perfect and perfect doesn't exist and isn't attainable. I know it's stressing you out but if it's unreasonable as it sounds on my end this demand will harm your relationship with O so my final thought is NTA if you had the conversation with her and if you decide not based on OCD but what you want from your relationship with O and can live with the outcome of that choice. Right or wrong? If you cannot live with the consequences it's a bad idea.

She\u2019s an adult now and needs to take responsibility. I think telling her she has to pay if she\u2019s made a mess after the cleaner has come is fair but I think allowing her to clean is a better solution. She clearly lacks some domestic skills so getting her into the habit of cleaning now will benefit her massively even if it\u2019s not to the high standard you prefer.

I\u2019d hate to see the inside of any of your houses if suddenly you have to go to therapy for not wanting the place to be a riot after you\u2019ve paid a lot of money for it to get cleaned.

An adult should never need a warning that there could be consequences (the punishment is irrelevant in my point), that is how you treat a child. Truth be told this feels like every one here is treating the daughter as a child that needs things spelled out for her. Being treated like that does not help any young adult grow. You can argue that OP's punishment was way to hard (and I may very well agree with you), but that phrase I disagree with.", "The footprints and crumbs are not going to be there by next cleaning, because OP does not want to go a week with that mess in the house. But she also does not feel that she should have to clean it up (fair) and also somehow feels that her step daughter is not capable of cleaning it up adequately? So basically, in her eyes there is no solution other than her cleaning it herself, but the clean house is effectively ruined whatever her daughter does. That\u2019s why she is requesting money - she wants her money back for the cleaning she paid for.\n\nHonestly, having lived with someone with OCD, the cleanliness standards can often be crushing. I think everyone should be responsible for their own mess, but you can\u2019t push an unreasonable standard onto everyone simply for your own comfort.

I think the easiest thing to do, though, is just tell her no guests unless an adult is home. That way when they're done cooking or whatever, you tell ALL of them, it's clean up time now, and make them do it. Pretty soon, they'll do it without being asked.

Always wished the US did the same). \n\nIf you're stepping into someone elses home and they don't want you walking in with your shoes (aside from delivery ppl), its not hard to abide by that. I assume most people wouldn't care since it's not ther home.

Any time I start veering toward \"people must cater to my bubble or I will rage,\" my therapist reins me back in if my requests aren't reasonable. OCD and similar issues can snowball quickly, which is how people who once seemed \"normal but quirky\" turn into absolute hoarders if they don't seek help. \n\nWhen I moved back in with my parents during the pandemic (after seven years living alone), there was a lot of adjusting because I no longer had full control of my entire living space. My therapist was pretty blunt with \"your room is *yours* but the house belongs to *everyone*.\" Negotiations are required. We had a \"household session\" where my parents and I sat down with my therapist and had those negotiations.\n\nWhenever I see a \"I have X, therefore everyone in my life must Y\" posts, I know the comments are going to be a shitshow of people arguing about how \"X is a disability that must be accommodated\" or \"even with X, your request of Y is bonkers because X is a *you* problem.\" There is always a middle ground, and therapy is a fantastic way to find what that is. \n\nI always try to make an analogy to a physical disability. If you are primarily a wheelchair user, it's reasonable to require space for your chair to move freely about your home. It's *not* reasonable to expect your roommates to carry you everywhere, all the time, like you're Yoda in a backpack. That said, if you have a new chair or something has changed, you might need help transferring more than you did before. Or you might have some physical therapy you need a partner for. \n\nIt's the same with a mental disability. Keeping reasonable standards of cleanliness/order and allowing someone to have an area under their own control - fair. Being flexible when situations change or a person is working on a new area in therapy - fair. Having to follow a 20 page checklist in order to exist in the space - that's Yoda in a backpack. \n\nOP asking for her to clean the mess? Fine. Having the house deep cleaned again and sending a bill?

Its the whole purpose of shoes, to avoid tracking dirt from one area to another.

Do people sleep with them on?", "LOL, right, OP has definitely never been a renter.", "Since she mentions OCD, I wonder if some of the \"footprints\" were just obvious outlines of shoes in freshly vacuumed carpet, but because she knows they were made by *shoes* they are dirty footprints?
