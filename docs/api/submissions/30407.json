Perhaps they have agreements with some teaching hospitals?", "The online PhD programs I researched all had lab or clinical aspects that had to be done in person at local facilities. They had partnerships to facilitate this since there was no physical campus.", "I got mine a decade ago, and the stress is still with me!", "You're thinking of medical schools. The hands on learning in med school certainly can't be done online.", "1. That's not truely online then.  \n\n2. The bulk of most chem/physics/engineering PhD programs is lab work and original research.  If a third party is \"facilitating\" this, that's shady.  You need to be integrated with your adviser's group.  Their older grad students/post docs are an important mentoring team for a beginning grad student. Dropping in is just not cutting it. \n\nIf you have the ability to show up in person to a lab, just apply to local state university.", "Souls regenerate like livers. The people I know who quit their PhD seem to have bounced back the fastest. But some of us are just stubborn masochists.", "I'm a semester away from being done with my master's. Can't wait.", "Being accepted into a PHD programme is nice, but it is not an achievement that must be celebrated with gifts, let alone expensive gifts. Completing a PHD is a reason to celebrate, but even then no expensive gifts are required. When I got my PHD I got mainly books and other small but thoughful gifts by friends and family. The only ones who gave me a bigger gift were my parents who helped my buy my first car (used and quite cheap).", "You and mom can celebrate your sister by taking her out to a very nice dinner for a whole lot less than $700.

I farted yesterday.  Please send me a Mercedes Benz.", "Someone who ASKS other to \"celebrate them\" (with extremely expensive gifts, no less) is either tacky, tactless, crude, or just plain ignorant.\n\nGetting into a PhD program is an accomplishment. It's not a $700 coffee machine accomplishment, though.  It's more a \"Let me take you to lunch\" accomplishment.\n\nI shudder to think what she's going to demand once she gets that (online) doctorate.", "NTA. I  think you were extremely generous in offering her a coffee machine worth $350 used. I have never heard of anyone being given \"celebration gifts\" for entering a program. Possibly once they graduated, but even then not usually from siblings.", "NTA - send her a $5 Dunkin' Donuts card.", "Umm... NTA? That stuff is usually celebrated with dinner or something. Dafuq", "You celebrate when she graduates from the program, not when she\u2019s accepted.", "Wait for getting into the program?? Not even graduating? That\u2019s maybe worth a drink.", "It was the same coffee machine and she didn't want it??? \nDef NTA sisters suck from my experience. Except for my SIL, she's the best little sister I could ask for.", "NTA. It's not like she graduated and obtained a PhD. She is awfully entitled", "NTA. What the hell?", "NTA, I mean shoot, I live free stuff even if gently used. If I can clean it to basically new, no complaints here. I'd get it if you let it sit and now it's filled with mild in crevices, but sounds like you used it a few times and it's just sat there gathering dust. At least 60-80% of my favorite things are used.", "Lol online PhD program \ud83d\udc80 dumbass is gonna cheat or flunk out for sure. Id bet a 700 dollar coffee machine on that", "What\u2019s she going to ask for when she graduates? The audacity\u2026", "NTA Since when is getting into a PhD program an occasion to celebrate and give gifts? After graduating and receiving the degree, maybe. Then the blatant requests for gifts would turn me off so much,I'd honestly just ignore her and not even respond.", "I have questions. \n\nHow old is sister? Of those years, has she been like this? Is she married, in a relationship and if yes either way, does her partner act like this? Put up with that crap? \n\nTell her you'll do something when she celebrates your child and their first 10 accomplishments.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "I'm ready to tell your sister she sounds like an online scammer. If a sibling offered to send me their nearly unused fancy coffeemaker (the same model!!), I'd be thankful, not criticizing you for pawning off your used goods. She's being a brat.\n\nFor her next birthday or holiday present, I'd probably get her a plastic pour-over cone and a 50-pack of filters.", "Wedding registries and baby registries would like a word.\n\nBut yeah, tacky.  She may have been less than subtly trying to make a point that there are more accomplishments in life than marrying and having children but even that argument is a bit off. \n\nWedding registries and baby registries are really meant to set people up for their next phase in life, which back in the day for women was usually their first time living independently. Now, though.... all but one Wedding I've been to in the past 20 years are between two people who were already well set up independently of their parents and really didn't need the financial boost from their community to own pots and pans. So it does start to come off as a gift for an accomplishment rather than a helping people get on their feet.

The policies have been put into place in the past 1-2 years so fairly new. I\u2019m a first year STEM PhD student getting around $30k. I haven\u2019t heard of anything over $35k though, so maybe past that is for postdocs", "Wow, very informative! Guess I gotta head to the East coast!"]}
