Who the hell has the gall to text people and demand people celebrate anything by sending gifts? Crazy entitlement.", "NTA. She sounds so entitled!

She's got a lot of nerve", "Because online PhD programs don\u2019t just admit anyone who qualifies for student loans.\n\nOh, wait.  That\u2019s their entire business model.", "Stuck on your sister\u2019s use of the word \u201copportunity\u201d. What an opportunity she\u2019s offering you!\n\nSeriously, sometimes I wish had that level of self confidence and audacity. NTA. Send her back the \u2018opportunity\u2019 to buy something of higher value to celebrate the arrival of her nibling.", "NTA, she can go buy a new $700 coffee machine with the money she makes from her PHD.", "NTA, to be honest, depending on what the PhD program it is, it's not that difficult to get into.  Graduating is a whole different story but to celebrate just for getting into a program isn't worth a $700 celebration.  And of course she wanted your brand of coffee maker...", "I just got into a bachelor's program after finally getting my bipolar diagnosed and under control.

NTA", "NTA ~ sounds quite entitled. \n\nI wouldn't put much more thought into the negative situation. If she needs recognition that bad, get her a card or something. \n\nThat's a bit much to expect anyone to send as a congratulations gift for getting into a program.", "NTA - who sends the link to a super expensive machine and requests you \u201ccelebrate\u201d them by buying it?? wack", "Sometimes people need to be told they are ridiculous and inappropriate. She is both. NTA", "NTA\n\nI shudder to think of what she'll expect from you from her wedding registry.\n\nAchieving placement in a PhD program merits a nice dinner. Even a gently used really expensive coffee machine is a lot for someone who hadn't actually earned the degree yet, imo!", "NTA. It sounds like your family is taking more than they are giving in your relationship. There's no reason for you to have to gift a very expensive gift. I also don't think getting into a PHD program warrants such celebration. I think a dinner and a nice card would be a beautiful gesture. But not if they are not respectful and supporting of your own family.", "NTA\n\nEntitled sister won't accept gently used coffee machine?  What's up with that?

This isn\u2019t even her finishing the program. That\u2019s crazy. A nice little congrats phone call would have sufficed in my opinion. Maybe at absolute most a $20 gift card to a coffee shop", "A $20 dollar coffee machine with a $10 grinder will make coffee just as well. I could see her complaint if you were too cheap for a $30 gift, but asking for $700 is insane. \n\nAnd it really isn\u2019t hard to get into a PhD program for Americans where acceptance rates are sky high. Different story for international people who face 1% odds.", "I can only think her request is audacious. I made a wedding registry and the most expensive thing is a stand mixer and I'm a baker and that's not close to 700. For weddings gifts and sometimes even expensive gifts are a thing. It's not a thing for just getting into a program, maybe graduating from one. All she's owed is maybe a nice dinner?\n\nNTA", " I would tell her that you'll get her a brand new coffeemaker when she got into a REAL college, and graduated with a REAL PhD. NTA.", "I'm genuinely surprised by the stories I see on Reddit about entitled people. Are these folks making around $60,000 a year? If these are always wealthy individuals, they really need a strong dose of reality. It's astonishing that some folks are struggling to have enough to eat and meet basic needs while others are asking for $700 coffee makers from their family. OP, please tell me your family isn\u2019t rich and this is just a very entitled outrageous sister? My faith in rich people is dwindling from what I see on Reddit.", "In my state if the dog has bitten before, the Plaintiff can recover treble damages.", "NTA, she's got a lot of nerve sending the link like that then implying that you're trying to unload your trash on her.  Maybe buy her a Mr Coffee if she actually **completes** the program.", "NTA. Your sister feels entitled. In her mind Her graduation is more important than anything you do, even your child. And she thinks you owe her only the best. Enjoy your money, say congratulations and ignore her mercenary requests.", "Yerp, NTA\n\nHope you feel better.", "Nope. It\u2019s all about her. Everything is all about her.", "I highly recommend a card from a speciality company with pictures of coffee machines, bookends and her PHD programme.

And most likely a pretentious one, at that.", "I took my sister to lunch when she got into her specialty program. I bought her a gift *after she graduated.* And throughout her process, I made sure to offer her any assistance I could.\n\nBut, why does she expect a gift for getting in? The reward is already hers? She got accepted. YAY! for her? NTA. \n\nI don't own a $700 coffee machine. So, no one needs to ask me to buy them one. WTH?", "NTA.  It's extremely tacky and in poor taste to ask for gifts to be celebrated.  She got into a program, she hasn't gotten a PhD yet.  What's she going to ask for then?", "Well done, she went to school\n\nNTA you offered her what she wanted, she turned it down, its her own loss", "WTF\n\nI woke up this morning. Can I get a $150 coffee machine?\n\nThe entitlement is huge in this girl.\n\nNo gifts for her. Ever.", "Gift giving is out of control!", "NTA but it sounds to me like you could have easily afforded it. I mean, what can a $700 coffee machine do that a $70 cannot? They both produce coffee.", "NTA and I'd suggest telling her that if she works really hard at her PhD she can then afford to buy any shit she chooses.", "NTA. Someone obviously wants an expensive coffee machine and doesn\u2019t want to pay for it. You get gets when you graduate not when you get in somewhere. She probably isn\u2019t even attending; she\u2019s just trying to get an expensive gift and some attention.", "Isn't it a bit early to be celebrating when she's only been accepted and hasn't actually completed the course?", "No. Just no.", "NTA expecting anything other than a congratulations text back or maybe a phone call seems entitled to me.", "Selling or giving things to family is a pain. If you sold or gave it to her she likely would have complained everytime something went wrong or needed maintenance.", "NTA It was kind of you to offer her your expensive machine. I'm glad you got the money for you to use.", "NTA. She sounds seriously entitled.", "NTA. You\u2019ve raised an entitled child.\nTime for you to undo the damage.", "NTA. \n\nGive her absolutely nothing for the \"accomplishment\" of merely starting an online program. \n\nIf you're buying her Christmas presents and birthday presents and God knows what else....  maybe stop that too.", "Your sister is unreal. I got no gifts after getting accepted into my *in-person* PhD program and I don\u2019t have any expectations for gifts after I defend, just maybe going out to dinner. I love my sister, we\u2019re really close, I\u2019ve never gifted her a $700 item. She\u2019s never gifted me a $700 item. NTA", "Gifts are not demanded. I'd send her a card saying \"Good job but it isnt a real degree since you can buy online degrees.\"", "NTA. Maybe she can ask for gifts once she has completed the degree. Maybe.", "NTA not everyone has 700$ laying around to spend on the exact model of coffee machine that you had. I would have preferred having a gently used model over having  someone spend that type of money on me. She only got \u201caccepted\u201d (which Yay! Go her!\u201d) but maybe it would be different if she actually graduated instead. That\u2019s too expensive of a gift to get for just an acceptance. It\u2019s a two way street..if she expects to be celebrated then she should learn to celebrate your accomplishments as well.", "NTA.  Acceptance into an academic program isn't a gift-giving occasion.  You could consider giving a gift when she graduates.  But I've known a lot of PhDs and master's graduates and it wasn't even common for them to receive graduation gifts from siblings.", "NTA. Tell her she gets the gift when she finishes the PhD. (I didn\u2019t even get a gift then.)", "NTA , i would send a link to some $700 baby stuff, and tell you are even now. Also signing up for the online phd isn\u2019t rocket science (unless that\u2019s the topic).. she should finish it first, that is something to celebrate..", "NTA. Btw: Online PHD\ud83d\ude33", "You are NTA, your sister however is entitled! \n\nPerhaps tell your sister you will toast her achievements with a beer at dinner.  Congratulations on a great achievement.\n\nIt would be wrong of me to give you money or buy you an expensive gift as that send the wrong message that each time you hit a milestone we are expected to put our hands in our wallet and throw cash at you when we have a child who we could spend the money on.", "NTA\n\nYou don't celebrate demands and ransom notes...", "When she graduates, get her a regular drip Mr coffee pot!", "Info: did you do something to celebrate the accomplishment independent of this gift nonsense?", "NTA. Also nobody in academia is gonna take her PhD from whatever diploma mill she's going to seriously. Won't be worth the paper it's printed on. If she's serious about a PhD she needs to be in an actual PhD program where she's meeting people and making professional connections in addition to advancing her research. You should all probably be stopping her from wasting her time and money on this shit", "NTA- Getting in to the PhD rates a bottle of champagne in the 'second nicest one at the supermarket' bracket for anyone on a reasonably comfortable level of disposable income. If you've not long had a baby, prosecco and a congratulations card would be about the maximum I'd think reasonable. I say this as someone who really would be chuffed to get into a PhD program and really does not want a baby.", "NTAH! \nWhy are other people expected to celebrate the achievement by giving her stuff! Especially when she is dumb and insensitive!", "Also, seems silly to have a big celebration for just getting into a program. Graduating might be worthy, but still an asshole move to demand gifts.\n\nNTA.", "I knew a couple that got engaged and on their registry (for the engagement party, not the wedding) they asked for a $2,000 dishwasher but they planned on buying a second house and renting the one with the potential new dishwasher to tenants.... Like dude you want me to upgrade your house so you can charge higher rent from people???", "Most people get a gift when they graduate - not for being accepted. WTH is that about?", "Also: an online PhD program?", "I was wondering how she makes the online Ph.D. pay for itself in the long run? What do the institution's job placement and retention numbers look like for their alumni?", "I remember all the doctoral candidates at school back in the day complaining that Ph.D. stands for Perseverance, HUMILITY and Dedication.  AT least they could joke about their stress? \ud83e\udd23", "Of all the people I know who got into programs that were very hard to get into none did more than have a celebratory dinner out or backyard barbecue.", "It's an online program- pretty sure it's not difficult to get into", "Ngl, you deserve higher praise than OP's sister. Getting mental health under control is a huge deal. Good luck on your degree.", "Best wishes! Hope you smash it.", "Inflation bro. Should be $30 gift card in this era.", "Huh?", "I did Venmo her money to help with textbooks. I do not know how to even confront her behavior.", ">Most people get a gift when they graduate\n\nDo people generally buy their siblings a gift for graduating from university? It's certainly not expected where I'm from.", "For real!", "right. like maybe lunch, dinner, or drinks or something like that to celebrate being accepted, but not a gift worth hundreds of dollars.", "I read the title a couple of times and *still* didn't catch that this leach just got *in* to the program, not *out* of it. \n\nRequesting (demanding) a $700 gift is beyond rude regardless, but could be a proportional doctoral graduation gift for some families, but just getting into the program - hell no.", "Treble damages is a term that indicates that a statute permits a court to triple the amount of the actual/compensatory damages to be awarded to a prevailing plaintiff.", "Not really, if you did it would be something more commemorative or sentimental. Not a big ticket luxury item lol.\n\nIt's standard for people to send money for high school graduations. Less standard for subsequent ones.", "i think it\u2019s expected from parents, and it\u2019s common to receive gifts from other family too but not expected.", "This isn't just university but a doctoral program, typically taking 6-ish years after the undergraduate degree. That deserves recognition. Obviously, families will differ in what that means, though. \n\nBut, the obnoxious sister hasn't put in her 6 post-graduate years yet, so no, I can't imagine any set of family traditions that would include gifting her anything yet.", "I and my dad bought university themed charms for my sisters Pandora bracelet when she graduated. She got a little mortarboard/hat with the year on it, and an owl holding a diploma. Maybe $130AUD each. We also took her for drinks. When I graduated my PhD, she bought me charms for my bracelet. Nothing like $700+ though.", "I did. And my friends do stuff like that too. But, honestly, its more about acknowledging and celebrating their achievements.", "I gave my brother flowers, certainly nothing terribly expensive, just a little something nice.", "My sister and I are really close. We haven\u2019t given each other graduation gifts.", "Siblings, not really. Parents, aunts/uncles, grandparents, maybe. Usually that\u2019s more of a \u201ccongrats! Here\u2019s a little boost to help start your adult life :)\u201d type of gift. Grand total, I think I got $100 from my aunt, a pack of wool socks from my other aunt (which is my standard gift ask for Christmas/birthday anyway, I love getting workboot socks), and like, a new pair of boots from my parents. My friend had a choice between a trip to Europe or $5k cash from her parents, but, y\u2019know. To each their own.", "Definitely depends on your family/community! I'm an only child so in our family, if we're close enough that we regularly see each other outside of big events or holidays where we see literally everyone then yes, it's common for us to gift the graduate something. And for those we gift things to, they generally give gifts in return. We've gifted things for high school, college and graduate graduations. However, we've never gifted anything close to being worth $700 and never would lol", "I bought my sister a bottle of champagne, parents treated her to an expensive meal. That's what most graduates tended to expect, maybe a bit of jewellery if you were lucky.", "Like some small present. I mean, you graduated, so lets celebrate it a bit. We dont get many things in life to celebrate. Definitely not a $700 coffee machine tho.", "Huh?", "Wrong thread, I think", "I can't even relate to the people who got a car when they turned 16? Did not happen in our house. \ud83e\udd23", "Yes. And finishing it will be worth celebrating. Getting in is easy. And my money is on entitled sis quitting because PhDs are hard and soul crushing."]}
