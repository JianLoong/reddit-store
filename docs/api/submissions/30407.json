What about when she graduates- are you expected to buy her a new car?? Ugh i can\u2019t stand when people demand gifts unless it\u2019s a wedding or baby shower only because that is a cultural thing for me - many people actually ask the celebrant for a gift registry for those events. But to just be accepted by a program?!?!?", "I\u2019m pretty sure there are zero legitimate online PHD programs and she is going to a degree mill school.", "Your sister is the A here!", "NTA. If she wants it so bad she can buy it herself. She should not expect other to buy things for her just because she got into her school program.", "NTA - your sister is delusional. That is all.", "NTA lol", "Seems like some people create new reasons to receive gifts & have a parade in their honor. \nIt\u2019s great that she got into a PhD program but her entitlement & expectation for expensive gifts is wild to me.\n\nWhat happened to a simple \u2018congratulations\u2019 or perhaps taking them out to dinner to celebrate? She\u2019s essentially creating a gift registry to include a $700 coffee maker. Lol I didn\u2019t even request something that expensive when I got married. I mean why not just buy her a new house?\n\nYou can \u2018celebrate her\u2019 by sending her a card or taking her out for a drink", "People are obsessed with themselves\u2026I got invited to a half birthday party\u2026for a 6month old.", "NTA and a more normal thing would be \u201cI got into this program and gonna go get dinner/lunch/whatever to celebrate who wants to join me\u201d", "*looking at weddings with only 500$+ items on the registry*", "> PhD programs don\u2019t just admit anyone who qualifies for student loans.\n> \n> Oh, wait. That\u2019s their entire business model.\n\nPizza hut Delivery!", "I\u2019m all for online education but I can\u2019t wrap my head around how an online only phd could have the same components as a traditional one. Part of the phd experience is having to work synchronously with people who are going to challenge you at each step. It would be a very difficult to do that online. I think online would work for some other types of doctorates but phd- your life is basically that subject until you graduate.", "Amazing! Good luck with everything man! Bet your wife is so proud!", "My supervisor bought me a pint of Guinness lol", "Tbh, I wouldn't even send her anything at this point. For her entitlement, she can have a congratulations and like it \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "\"Because you gave me something *used* and I asked for brand new!\"\n\nWell, ok, buy your own, sis.\n\nMy sister and my brother-in-law offered me their espresso/specialty coffee machine. While I am not a coffee drinker, I still appreciated that they thought of me and told them so. Polite refusal exists; some people just choose to be tactless.", "Op affording it doesn't come into it though. The sister is entitled and bratty and doesn't deserve more than a congratulatory meal and a high five!\n\nTotally agree with the 2nd part though. Why does she feel the need for such an expensive coffee machine!", "Phillips late go!", "She hasn\u2019t earned/defended a PhD yes, she just got accepted into the program.", "Right!?!? I\u2019m in a Ph.D. Program and while, yes, I was excited to get in I didn\u2019t  expect anyone else to be that excited. \n\nMaybe, MAYBE, a party and gifts IF the person graduates but  a $700 coffee pot? No. \n\nMy Mr. Coffee brews enough caffeine to keep me up writing at night. I think it was $50 at Walmart.", "Some doctorate programs are very competitive and absolutely should be celebrated, but like with a nice meal or drinks at most and this doesn\u2019t really sound like one of those.", "yeah, getting in is not easy, but not once have I heard (in friend circles, some are PHD) of celebrating getting in, at any lvl.\n\neven when people are done with it, it's not getting it that gets celebrated, but being done with it :D", "I think celebrating it with a nice dinner is fine. Expecting lavish gifts worth 700 dollars is crazy. NTA.", "Good grief. I read it as she'd completed said course. \n\nThat is absolutely unbelievable!\n\nCan just imagine how she demands if she ever gets preggo. Or married.", "I had a friend set up a go fund me for her masters degree in Art.\n\nArt.", "OMG the mind boggles with the entitlement", "That's fucked.", "Was the baby born around Christmas? Ive heard some people do this because people are too busy to show up for bday parties in December.", "That sounds like a fun idea to get the family and friends together. People with newborns can get pretty isolated. What's your problem with it?", "FFS \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "People are really doing too much \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd2f", "And don\u2019t specify the gift", "The program is Pretty High Demands, and I suppose she's living up to it.", "Really, who gets gifts for graduating. Is this an American thing?", "Yep. I celebrated my fully funded acceptance into my PhD program with a drink at a college bar. Successfully defending my dissertation on the other hand, I threw a party. But I didn\u2019t expect gifts\u2026 I was 30 years old.", "It is the model for most online programs (save a few in health care).", "My advisor bought me a pint as well.", "Textbooks in a PhD program?? Now I\u2019m generally curious about hire different an online program is compared to a tradition. Typically textbooks aren\u2019t a thing at that level.", "In my PhD program, I needed $700 more than a stupid coffee pot.", "It might be one of those espresso machines that let you play home barista.  Those can be pricey.", "If it's an online program, I very much doubt that it is competitive or even accredited.", "I don\u2019t think j any of those super competitive doctorate programs are going to be based online tbh", "Accomplishments like that can be celebrated, I think, but it's a *small* celebration.  A glass of wine, a dessert, something like that.", "I can imagine Sheldon Cooper saying this.", "I really appreciated the double use of the word Art. \ud83d\udc4c", "Wtf?! I assume the US. I am thankful that I moved away from the US around the time gofundme became big. I find it ridiculous that people set up these things for everything from holidays, medical, funerals, job loss, etc. That is just unheard of where I live.", "New rule, you can only get a masters degree in art if you can pay for it with the profits from selling your art.", "For my PhD I got a cake from two friends. And two sheets of paper from the university.", "My brother and SIL took me out to dinner after my graduation from uni (master's degree) and paid for it. But my mom and dad weren't able to travel there for health reasons, so I think that was part of it.", "Why won't this stupid assumption go away? It's 2023, EVERYTHING is moving online. Most online schools are fully accredited. And even brick-and-mortar schools have online programs nowadays. Online education takes much more discipline than in person education does as well, because you have to hold yourself accountable and keep up with the work. There's no one there for you to ask a quick question and get an immediate answer. You're basically on your own. I've done both, and online was much more of a challenge (if you're actually wanting to learn).", "yeah, not like they shouldn't. but I'm juxtaposing what I see as a cultural norm with \\*checks notes\\* a gift registry", "Yeah. F art!!! \ud83d\ude0a", "That\u2019s because everything costs something in the US. People are struggling.", "Yeah I agree with this. Also, fewer and fewer people will give gifts for the subsequent ones IME. Never heard of an acceptance gift except maybe from a parent and that would just be something to help with a move or something practical, not a luxury coffee machine. Tbh the hand-me-down coffee machine is like a perfect gift for this situation as it's beyond generous and also something she will probably use heavily. Crazy for turning it down.", "I\u2019ve been known to send a congratulations card with a little \u201csurvival kit\u201d for friends and family who\u2019ve gotten into competitive programs. Nothing big. Coffee chain gift cards, snacks, adult coloring books, little things like they. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve spent more than $50. I can\u2019t imagine a big ticket item for just getting in to a program. But a little useful gift to acknowledge the moment is fun to give.", "That's so sweet!", "Omg could my day get any more embarrassing?! \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b", "Bachelor's? Yes, those can be online and are fine. I teach undergrads both online and in person and I agree with everything you said.\n\nBut an online PhD? I am not aware of a single reputable online PhD program. PhDs are completely different from a bachelor's degree. It's much more of an apprenticeship model with a lot of informal education that is difficult to structure and often requires specialized  equipment. There may be a point at which some online PhD programs work, but right now I don't think there are any. \n\nI would be very interested to know of any legit online PhDs. I would be happy to learn if things have changed.", "It may take more discipline to complete a program online but being in a phd program and having researched a bunch of them, I have never heard of a competitive phd program at an RI university that is online, at least not in Canada or the us.", "No I'm totally with you, a kitchen appliance is inappropriate here", "Things aren\u2019t free where I live now but you don\u2019t go begging people with a webpage to fund your life.", "On the practical note, for passing my qualifying exams, I got a new (fancy-ish $700) bike because I bike commuted for undergrad and was going to continue doing that for grad school. My parents bought it for me as a gift because it was a practical upgrade (and I used it daily for the next 5 years).", "Can confirm soul is crushed I'm a 5th year", "From what I've seen getting in isn't easy exactly (an online one proabbly is though). But would warrant only an enthusiastic \"that's great, well done\".\n\nI'm in my final year and I absolutely hate my life. All my PhD friends loathe their PhD. Do not do it lol", "Can confirm they do come back! \nIm 3 years free, and it's amazing!"]}
