This happens a lot... What you could do is speak with a few bakers tell them what you want and your budget and they can actually create something to fit your needs and within your budget without you hiding that it's for a wedding, especially if it's a cake without all the frills.

Every time they mentioned wedding in a shop, the assistant changed the price tag to more expensive!\nOur wedding cake was two shop bought, plain, iced cakes, one fruit and one sponge.

With a good conversation they will be able to offer you somthing that fits your taste and wishes. for wedding cakes you pay extra, a part of that is for the decoration which takes a lot of their time and has to be done by a pattisier, a part is for timing, they have to make it at a very specific moment, a part is for shipping, since weddingcakes are ofthen difficult to package and a part is because it is a wedding and people are willing to pay more.\n\nSo if you order a cake without decoration, only one layer, based on normal sizes (so perhaps 2 or 3 smaller ones istead of 1 large) and without a coating that will attrackt moist. They can make a very nice cake for you at a decent price. Now you only need a bakery that understands your wishes and you will not have to pay the wedding uplift", "NTA.", "Don't let them do the wedding upsell, they hike prices for these types of celebrations. Say it's for a reunion or something and they don't charge more.

I'm assuming they're way, way, way more expensive than a normal cake. And if you do just want a small, simple cake and not a huge one like you usually see, you shouldn't have to pay more for that.", "NTA. However, you said it yourself, the extra money equals extra care. \n\nI have a friend who ordered cupcakes for a \"30th birthday\" that was really for a wedding. 4 days before the wedding the baker called and said that due to a family emergency their order would be cancelled but she could transfer the order to a recommended bakery, they'd be ready on time, just not as elaborate, no extra cost. When my friend fessed up to her lie (she was angry and it slipped out) the baker laughed at her. Apparently she kept only 3 orders out of 12. One was for a memorial, the other two? You guessed it, weddings. Baker immediately told her she was processing the refund. When my friend reached out to the recommended bakery they knew all about her and quoted her rush wedding rates. She ended up paying 3x what she would have originally paid and they were flat cupcakes with fondant circles on the top.", "YWNBTA.", "NTA, at all.

You just stated you really don\u2019t need or want a traditional wedding cake?  The aspects of doing a wedding cake that make it so expensive are the ingredients, time, size, and specialness.  If you basically commission a simple cake without those considerations and the baker gives you a price you agree to, why is that a cheat?", "YWNTA - They aren't being cheated out of 'money owed'. It is a known fact of the industry that saying 'wedding' or 'reception' automatically jumps prices. Why? because they think they can.\n\nIf the same exact work is being done on a cake (ie. NOT multiple tiers, fancy edging, etc) then there is no reason for them to think anything of it. If you are after a simple cake, GET a simple cake. You can actually add your own fresh flowers to the base once you get it home and 'wedding it up'. I did that for my mothers anniversary and it looked like an actual wedding cake. Total cost? $25 for the cakes (one small round, one tiny round on top, bought separately, I put the small on top myself) and $10 for roses and babys breath I added.", "NTA if you are ordering a simple cake that you (or someone you know) will pick up prior to the wedding.  The extra cost for 'wedding cakes' is because they are usually quite elaborate, they need to be delivered, and they need to be 'set up'.  A one or two layer cake that could reasonably be considered a birthday or other party cake is not the same.", "NTA\n\nThe wedding industry is weird. As soon as you use the word \"wedding,\" people attach all kinds of weird connotations and expectations that they'll unapologetically charge you out the ass for - even if you don't want any of it! Vendors deal with a lot of touchy bridezillas and groomzillas who lose their minds if everything doesn't come out Pinterest-worthy, so they assume all the bells and whistles, and many will even charge extra just because they anticipate you being a stressed-out pain in the ass.\n\nFor wedding cakes, bakeries will prioritize aesthetics over taste and sell you on all kinds of weird frills. They look great on Instagram, but they rarely taste good enough to be worth the calories, even at otherwise great bakeries.\n\nIMO, price is only one of the *plethora* of reasons not to say the word \"wedding\" to vendors.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don\u2019t care about getting a \u201cwedding quality\u201d cake but also mention that you\u2019re highly focused on the taste \u2014 have you considered that the bakery might take additional care w/r/t flavor if they know it\u2019s for an important event? Will the bakery even allow you to have a tasting for a \u201cregular\u201d cake?\n\n2. What time of year are you planning on getting married and will your venue be climate-controlled? Are you planning on displaying the cake during the reception or just bringing it out during the cutting? I ask because I\u2019ve seen a few couples skip the traditional fondant wedding cake in favor of a buttercream cake that they displayed the whole time and that choice didn\u2019t end well for all of them, including my friends who had a barn wedding in Georgia in the middle of summer (the cream melted off and the cake slumped over).

You want a small, normal, tasty cake, you're buying a small cake, how do you *OWE* them anything just because you're eating it at your wedding? That friend is really crazy and if she sells something or provides a service I would think long and hard before EVER using someone that entitled.

Last week it was $40?!\" \"Yes, but this is wedding makeup.\" \"But, this is the exact same look as I used last week with exactly the same product and time!\" \"Yes, but this is for a wedding.\"\n\n.....No.\n\nNTA", "I worked at a bakery for a few years. We didn't charge extra for \"wedding\" cakes, just for ones that required tiers and decorations, and also wouldn't have questioned one that just said something like \"Congratulations X and Y\" (usually an anniversary).

Things happen and while I\u2019d understand that I think anyone would be upset over a late or cancelled order no matter the occasion. As long as it was handled professionally I would just go with the flow honestly.\n\nI\u2019m getting the cake done professionally and having my mother do the cupcakes (she offered as a wedding gift) so if they suddenly couldn\u2019t pull through I would just ask for a refund and diy a plain wedding cake on my own. It wouldn\u2019t be ideal but if something happens last minute you roll with the punches.", "Also I only really charge more for weddings because they usually have more detail, and are larger as well as need delivering and set up an hour away. But I would charge the same for if it was a birthday cake that required the same too.\n\nSome bakers do charge more just because its a wedding but most bakers I know don't charge more just because its a wedding cake", "The wedding will be in March, indoors and the cake will be refrigerated until it\u2019s time to cut. Honestly the flavour aspect I meant more so that\u2019s why we are going with cupcakes for guests. The cake is just for show to cut and me and my fianc\u00e9 will eat that. So while we hope it tastes good we assume that if a bakery is in business it should taste good regardless of what event it\u2019s for lol but I get what you\u2019re saying!", "Yeah. I have Baker friends who's prices only change with each added decoration or pattern etc. The more intricate the design the more it costs because it takes much longer to create. Then of course there's all the edible decorations such as flowers etc, they have to be made individually and then put onto the cake... A lot of work goes into creating these beautiful cakes for events. The cost is usually down the actual cake type and the size. The rest is added frills.\n\nI know that bakers prefer couples to speak with them and set out the budget and then they can create something together with the couple within that budget that could look super expensive but at the very small price or even be simple and elegant. They just need to be asked \ud83d\ude0a"]}
