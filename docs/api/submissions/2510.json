In other words, I renounced my spousal right to a third of her separate property if she dies, making her sole beneficiaries her siblings or potential children. My debt and our incomes were also separated. We both got lawyers -- hers much more expensive than mine -- and notarized the prenup.\n\nNone of this was a problem for me -- as a man, I'm determined to pull myself up by the bootstraps, not rely on my wife's wealth for anything.

Either way, it didn't seem from your account of the story that she wanted anything other than for you to hug her and be with her in recognising it sucks.\n\nI realise she has more money overall. But it doesn't mean that venture of hers didn't hurt her ego and her esteem. It quite clearly did.\n\nI'm from a background like yours, I can't imagine that amount of money, or even marrying someone with that amount of money. So I get the impulse to roll your eyes at this. But instead of the practical \"fix it\" viewpoint, just give her the emotional help. I know it's hard, it would feel churlish to me too. But I'm not in a relationship with her, you are.

You aren\u2019t providing that.\n\nHer financial choices weren\u2019t smart, but many of us \u201cmiddle class\u201d folks lose money and still get love and support. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling burned by the prenup, I think you signed on for that as one sided as it is.\n\nI guess ~~ESH~~ YTA", "Dude, I was expecting to be on your side....but then it turns out all she wanted was an ear to vent to/shoulder to cry on.

I would never sign a prenup, so I get why you'd be mad, but then you don't get married.

But clearly we can when its a man who \"just wants even more\"\n\nAlso nice double standards you point out lol", "Ransomware and money laundering, yep.", "Good luck with your crypto sir!", "You would feel a bit of sympathy yeah, but if yoy told them dont do it, and they do it anyways, theres nothing you can do", "Her being an idiot with her money doesn\u2019t absolve him from being a shitty partner. \n\nIf this was the 10x time the same thing had happened, I\u2019d get the fatigue. But it seems like this was her first breakdown on the issue.", "Well, I think it was better of him to divorce his wife after seeing all this happening..", "She was certainly able to blow half of it on bad crypto so it\u2019s probably not that inaccessible.", "It doesn\u2019t really matter what the situation is, she prevented him from ever having her money. It isn\u2019t just future parental inheritance like the above commentator is trying to suggest.", "I'm not blaming anyone, but her completely independent choices led to her losses, despite being advised not to.

It's based on nothing.  Just some guys saying \"hey, we have a form of invisible money now.

Should he be empathetic if she lost it at a casino instead? Gambling is gambling -- sometimes you win, but mostly you lose.\n\nYeah, OP seems detached from the situation -- and from his wife as well. But she lost the money in a highly speculative market that showed signs of crashing *for months*. \n\nI dunno man, the \"that's rough\" she got seems more empathetic than the \"I told you so\" that she deserved.", "I have no idea where you get the idea that he's gloating or that is resentful because that's not in this post.
