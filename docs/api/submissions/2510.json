In other words, I renounced my spousal right to a third of her separate property if she dies, making her sole beneficiaries her siblings or potential children. My debt and our incomes were also separated. We both got lawyers -- hers much more expensive than mine -- and notarized the prenup.\n\nNone of this was a problem for me -- as a man, I'm determined to pull myself up by the bootstraps, not rely on my wife's wealth for anything. The only beneficial part of the prenup for me was that our incomes were also now separate, and I earned a somewhat higher income than her, and so I was okay with it overall.\n\nFive years later, I still don't have a seventh of her current wealth, but her investments haven't been doing great this year either.\n\nAs a sole crypto investor, things have been going very poorly for her. I had warned her not to do this, but she invests in a cryptocurrency called \"Monero,\" which is down 47 percent this year. About 5 percent of her money was not in her wallet and was in the FTX exchange itself, which she lost after FTX went bankrupt recently. She now has a net worth of around 18 million dollars.\n\nI don't invest in crypto, but rather in index funds. They've taken a hit this year as well, but based on historical performance, they should go back up eventually.

I told her \"that's rough\" -- not in a sarcastic way -- and I went upstairs to change.\n\nWhen I got back downstairs, she started bitching and complaining, talking about how \"nonchalant\" I was being about her losing money. I pointed out that she's still extraordinarily rich in spite of her poor choices and that she could stop investing in crypto at any time if she wanted to.

From the info you gave us I think she wanted to vent to you, because let's be fair here - for her that sucks. Maybe she wanted to make her own money too? I assume that money isn't self made by her.

Either way, it didn't seem from your account of the story that she wanted anything other than for you to hug her and be with her in recognising it sucks.\n\nI realise she has more money overall. But it doesn't mean that venture of hers didn't hurt her ego and her esteem. It quite clearly did.\n\nI'm from a background like yours, I can't imagine that amount of money, or even marrying someone with that amount of money. So I get the impulse to roll your eyes at this. But instead of the practical \"fix it\" viewpoint, just give her the emotional help. I know it's hard, it would feel churlish to me too. But I'm not in a relationship with her, you are.

You aren\u2019t providing that.\n\nHer financial choices weren\u2019t smart, but many of us \u201cmiddle class\u201d folks lose money and still get love and support. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling burned by the prenup, I think you signed on for that as one sided as it is.\n\nI guess ~~ESH~~ YTA", "Dude, I was expecting to be on your side....but then it turns out all she wanted was an ear to vent to/shoulder to cry on.  She didn't ask you for a dime.\n\nYou should never have signed a prenup if it angered you so much you'd be this salty years later.  I would never sign a prenup, so I get why you'd be mad, but then you don't get married.
