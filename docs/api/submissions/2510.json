Either way, it didn't seem from your account of the story that she wanted anything other than for you to hug her and be with her in recognising it sucks.\n\nI realise she has more money overall. But it doesn't mean that venture of hers didn't hurt her ego and her esteem. It quite clearly did.\n\nI'm from a background like yours, I can't imagine that amount of money, or even marrying someone with that amount of money. So I get the impulse to roll your eyes at this. But instead of the practical \"fix it\" viewpoint, just give her the emotional help. I know it's hard, it would feel churlish to me too. But I'm not in a relationship with her, you are.

You aren\u2019t providing that.\n\nHer financial choices weren\u2019t smart, but many of us \u201cmiddle class\u201d folks lose money and still get love and support. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re feeling burned by the prenup, I think you signed on for that as one sided as it is.\n\nI guess ESH.", "Dude, I was expecting to be on your side....but then it turns out all she wanted was an ear to vent to/shoulder to cry on.

I would never sign a prenup, so I get why you'd be mad, but then you don't get married.
