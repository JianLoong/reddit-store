They did exactly what you were scared of: made a massive fuss over nothing! Really, the only thing you had to decide was whether to have a massive fuss immediately after you knew you were pregnant (right when you were having health problems), or whether to have a massive fuss later, when everything was more stable. You made the right decision.\n\nAnd WTF at \"basically a teen pregnancy\" - as far as I can tell, you were 25 when you had your first?! Maybe a little on the younger side for modern trends in a lot of areas, but certainly neither teenage nor too young to know your own minds. When did they want you to wait? Until you were 42 and your career was nice and secure?! Nope. There are advantages and disadvantages to having kids early, just as there are advantages and disadvantages to having them late. It's your choice and no-one else's, and it sounds like you're good with that choice, which is all that really matters.\n\nBut after that, no wonder you didn't trust them with the news of the next one. They sound really controlling in their insistence that they should continue to have a parental role of judging your life as an educated adult married woman with a job and family.", "NTA\u2026 your daughter is 2 and you are 28. In what world is a 25/26 year old basically \u201ca teen pregnancy\u201d? You are already married. Why would you focus on your career and wait to have a husband? Are your parents completely unhinged??? Obviously, but wtf. \n\nI would honestly ask yourself if they are worth keeping around or having a last ditch boundary setting conversation. It takes a village to raise a child and if they aren\u2019t going to be safe people for you and your family\u2026 are they really part of your \u201cvillage?\u201d \n\nThey sound exhausting and I\u2019m glad that you recognized their behavior patterns in order to save yourself the frustration. Good luck, OP. Congratulations on your second baby, I hope they arrive safely and healthily.", "NTA. You knew that there would be drama, and wanted to postpone it as much as possible. \n\nShould you have told them earlier? Yes. But we all make decisions which look easier than right. Doesn't make you an asshole. Anyway, you knew that this day would come and were dreading it. Now that it is over, you can start relaxing.", "You're NTA. You handled that perfectly and honestly.\n\n> my sister (who also found out on the call) says that I was too harsh and that my parents only want the best for me which is why I should focus on my career before a husband/babies\n\nYour sister is drinking the same kool aid and reading the same script as your parents.
