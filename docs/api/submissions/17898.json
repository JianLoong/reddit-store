I tried to maybe make it go down a little smoother by sharing the pregnancy and the gender at the same time so it was a little more exciting.*\n\n**You did nothing wrong.**  \n\nYou tried to find a way to make your news be acceptable to them, which I recognize from years of dealing with my MIL.  Took us twenty years to learn that we didn't have to try to phrase our decisions in ways to get MIL to accept them, because she was only going to accept our decisions when she approved of them, anyway. And she only wanted to 'understand', that is, to get us to give her our reasons, so that she could try to change our minds and force us to comply with her wants, not our needs.  So, twenty years in, we learned to:  **state our decision, then not discuss it further, and repeat.**  There was a month where I basically did this a couple times a day, every day, near the end of the relationship.  \n\n\r*My parents just about flipped their lid that I had been keeping secrets* \n\nYou are an adult.  You made the decision to wait to give them this news, because of ***their*** previous bad behavior.  And **they are only making it very clear that your decision was a wise one, by their reactions here.**\n\n*and had not treated them like family.* \n\n***Family is supposed to treat you better than the rest of the world, and support you.***  Which they didn't do for you the last time.  And they aren't doing now.  THEY are the ones not treating **you** like family here.  I've had family members that, because of the behavior of some abusers, had to hold information close for longer than they wanted to, and were anxious about it.  The non-abusive family members, when they heard the news, respected what had had to be done.  They didn't blame.\n\n*I told them that my husband and I had waited* \n\nYou don't have to tell them your reasons any more, if they push on this.  And ***you don't have to discuss this again with them***, if you don't want to.  **They can ask questions, that you do not have to answer.**\n\n*They then asked if his parents knew, and I kind of dodged the question* \n\nDodging is fine.   ***You don't owe them this information.***  Your relationship with his parents is different, because you have learned to trust them, while your relationship with your parents has taught you, by experience, not to trust them to respect you and accept your decisions.  That's their fault, not yours. \r  \n\r  \n*Well, my mom was passive agressive saying that she guesses she will also be excluded from the birth,* \n\nI'm guessing that she said this to try to force you to say that she wouldn't be excluded.  But it's absolutely reasonable to exclude her when she behaves this way to you.\n\n*and I just had it. I laid it all out that they had been awful the first time and I don't want them to put a cloud over this pregnancy as well. I said that they should be celebrating the pregnancy instead of lecturing, and then I just hung up.*\n\nGood for you.  You told the truth.  You basically held them responsible for their own rude behavior during this conversation.   And then you protected yourself by hanging up and exiting that conversation.  You do not owe *them* any apology for this.  If they haven't yet apologized for their previous lack of support and their current manipulative response to your news, they should.  \n\n*My husband says that he was proud of me for standing up for myself,* \n\nHe's right.  Listen to him, not to the sister.\n\n*but my sister (who also found out on the call) says that I was too harsh*\n\nYou weren't too harsh.   **You made a decision that considered your own needs, your health and stress levels, and your situation,** including the lack of support you had gotten from your parents in the past.  It was reasonable to not tell them until you were ready, because of their reaction before.\n\n *and that my parents only want the best for me which is why I should focus on my career before a husband/babies.* \n\n**Your sister seems to think that you should let your parents make your choices and plans for you, instead of making your own.**  She's wrong.  You get to make your choices and decisions for yourself.   When your children are adults, you will respect them doing the same, because you've seen what it's like to have parents that put their own wants first.\n\n *was I the AH?*\n\nNTA.   \n\n**If they continue to mistreat you about waiting to tell them, it's okay to say something like \"As you won't let go of this, I'll be taking a month of time off from talking with you.**  I hope you take this time to look at your behavior and see how to change it.  Love you, bye.\"   Then block them, and rest.  Same thing with any flying monkeys trying to force you to put your parents' wants first, instead of taking care of your own needs.  \"Sorry, but I'm not discussing this, as I need to keep my stress down for the babe.  Love you, bye.\"   And if they won't stop, do a time out from them, too.", "NTA.

Then when you do contact them again, explain calmly that if they can not be excited for you to at least keep quiet about it.  Then when they start bitching, either hit the hang up or mute button. Repeat as necessary.", "NTA\n\nConsidering their reaction the first time, I\u2019d have waited this time as well.  By my calculations, you were pregnant with your first at around age 25.  That is a perfect time.  In your mid to late 20\u2019s you have started a career, but you still have the energy to have little bitty ones.  Much better than waiting until later when you have less energy.\n\nEnjoy your new child!  I hope for an easy rest of the pregnancy, quick and easy labor and delivery, and health baby and momma at the end.", ">Should you have told them earlier? Yes.\n\nCan I ask why? I don't get this perspective. Nobody owes anyone their personal information, especially if those people have already proven themselves to be in some way untrustworthy. OP's parents made her first pregnancy stressful, meaning she couldn't trust them not to cause her undue stress this time around. She needed to be hospitalised early on and had enough on her plate without her family making it worse. But even if that wasn't the case, nobody is entitled to know your personal information, not even your family.", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds like you're used to being wrong in your parents' eyes no matter what choice you make. If they want to be kept informed about your life, they need to make the effort to be supportive.", "I love the fact that you were a married 26 year old and got called a teen mom.  Who, from all appearances, was conceived and bought to birth by a 25 year old woman, who therefore must have been a deadass child bride by her own standards.\n\nNTA.  They sound awful.", "NTA\n\nWhy do you talk to these people multiple times a week?  I don't get it.", "Congratulations OP! \ud83e\udd73\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90", "Should you be focusing on your career? I don't know but that's definitely up to you, not them. Your children EXIST no matter how hysterical they act. NTA", "i dont care if your parents are trying to be supportive. They're doing a shitty job at it. They're being absolute dicks. Congratulations on your little boy and good on you for having a career you'er proud of, a good husband and a little daughter with a son on the way! Fuck your parents if they just cant be happy with that. You should NOT apologise for anything.   \nGood luck with everything!", "NTA at all. Marriage and family are the opposite of \u201cthrowing your life away\u201d. If your parents don\u2019t see that, I just feel sorry for them.\n\nCongrats on your baby!", "Sure they're part of her village.  The village idiots.  NTA", "NTA you are well old enough to be making your own life choices.", "Nope.  Completely fair when one set acts like this.  You reap what you sow.", "I think putting your parents on an information diet is a good plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>my parents only want the best for me which is why I should focus on my career before a husband/babies.\n\nHere's the thing. Thats condescending as hell. Thats literally saying you're not capable of making responsible choices in your own life.", "NTA", "NTA you did the right thing maybe keep them LC until they can accept that their actions have consequences and your not going to let them ruin this experience for you again.", "NTA you did the right thing maybe keep them LC until they can accept that their actions have consequences and your not going to let them ruin this experience for you again."]}
