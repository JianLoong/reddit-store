I plan on doing other activities as well, such as bounce houses,cookout, s'mores, movie by the pool, make your own cookies, etc., followed by a sleepover with some of her friends. It's gonna be a busy day, and there'll be roughly 30 kids at my house. Some parents are staying, and some are just dropping off their kids and picking them up later. I'm fine with this.\n\nI let G invited whoever she wanted, and she chose to invite a classmate, A, that is autistic. I was fine with this, as I've always taught G not to judge others based on their differences. \n\nHere is where my dilemma comes into play. A's mother called me last week to ask if it would okay just to drop off him and pick him up the next day so he could attend the sleepover. My problem is I have no experience with an autistic child, and my understanding is A is very low functioning. I guess he's prone to getting easily overwhelmed and will start to shutdown/outburst. \n\nI told A's mom that I wouldn't be comfortable with him being there by himself as I would be too busy with everything else going on and am inexperienced with autistic children.

Autistic mom of someone on the spectrum, here. She wants a free babysitter. Shame on her for even attempting this. Folks on the spectrum are often traumatized by untrained supervision/a lack of supervision. If she needs a night off, she can seek out the many services provided for Autistic folk or talk to her own family/friends.", "NTA, a reasonable compromise would be having A attend a few parts of the party and then leave prior to the sleepover. You aren't excluding or uninviting him, just recognizing you're not equipped to provide enough support. Especially since you'll have 29 other young children to watch! Seems like A's mom is just looking for a free night.", "NTA. As a single mom of an autistic child who hasn\u2019t had a break in a month, I would never consider leaving him at a birthday party for people he\u2019s not familiar with to take care of him. A\u2019s mother is an ass\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have to miss out\u2026 she can bring him and stay to take care of him.", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to turn you into respite care, and that\u2019s going to be a bad time for all involved.", "NTA it\u2019s the day of YOUR child\u2019s birthday, you will be entertaining and being pulled in so many directions. I personally would not feel comfortable either. Maybe they can get together for a sleep over when it\u2019s not as much going on?", "NTA and honestly, I question the judgement of the mother, who would send her autistic child to an overnight with people she doesn\u2019t know and to a place he\u2019s not familiar with.  I mean *maybe* a hour or so during the party, after making sure he\u2019s doing ok and several of the parents have her number. But this sounds like a 12+ hour affair.  No. That\u2019s a bad choice you\u2019re saving the mom from making.", "NTA. Your claim is that caring for a low functioning autistic child is different from caring for neurotypical children. This is a pretty uncontroversial claim. You aren\u2019t willing / able to care for A for an overnight. That doesn\u2019t sound strange to me, particularly if A is a lot of work to care for and you lack any relevant training. A\u2019s mother\u2019s reaction is telling - the fact that she played the \u201csingle mother alone time\u201d card shows you how she looks at these overnight parties, and that she\u2019s more concerned with getting a night off than setting her son up for success in his social life.", "NTA. You aren't equipped to handle him without his mother present. That isn't unreasonable.", "NTA - you\u2019re both protecting your child\u2019s ability to enjoy party AND protecting A by telling their mom that you aren\u2019t comfortable being a caretaker for A.\n\nBoundaries are ok", "Holy crap, she's an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer child needs her there and she's refusing to do her job as his mother? bleugh.\n\nI have 2 kids on the spectrum and while one of them was fine being left at parties if i wanted to leave her there (i didn't always..  depended on the kid and parents in question),  the other definitely couldn't be left.\n\nI was always there to supervise and make sure he and others had fun -  that was literally my job as his parent.     I'd have felt awful if i'd done any differently and either him or his friends or parents had struggled because of it.\n\nYes it's difficult being a single parent -  but it's even more difficult being a child on the spectrum that can't navigate social situations or cope without supervision. \n\nIf she's struggling more than she can handle,  she needs to reach out for assistance to social services or somewhere..    not just dump her child on people that have no experience and could end in disaster.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and I feel bad for A, because he was born from an AH.\n\nI can understand a parent in her situation needing sympathy...but once she pulled that crap, let her deal with it on her own. Block her.", "NTA. She has some nerve.", "NTA.\n\nWhen she said that you don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time, she exposed her intentions to have you as baby sitter for a full 24 hours.\n\nI am very high functioning autistic and I'm a handful even in the burgeoning twilight of my life.  There are potential triggers there that even mom hasn't thought of since this is uncharted territory.  I feel as an autistic man who has more or less learned to cope that if mother cannot be there for a couple of hours for her own autistic child that it can be construed as abuse.  I certainly feel that way, because I have some idea of what can happen with an autistic child in unfamiliar surroundings, from both the child's side and the neurotypical adult's side.\n\nDo not back down under any circumstances.  The child is invited if she's present at all times.  An hour or two should be enough for him.  He will indicate when he is overwhelmed.  Since the neighbourhood knows what has happened it should be easy to have several adults chaperone the mother so that she does not skip out.  She does not get a free babysitter overnight.  If she introduces a babysitter at the ready in the event that he gets overwhelmed and wants to go home, then the problem can be considered solved and you've reached a win/win consensus.", "NTA. She's using this opportunity as a babysitter/free time for herself. At 8, I'd have never let my (autistic) son be left in that situation. She asked you answered honestly, and now she's pissed and petty that you're unwilling to care for her child for 12-18 hours.", "NTA. This poor kid\u2019s mother is a big A though for making it about her.", "Based on the information provided, it seems that you are NTA for not feeling comfortable with having A attend the party without adult supervision. It's understandable that you don't have experience with autistic children and that you're concerned about not being able to properly care for him amidst the other activities and guests.\n\nIt's unfortunate that A's mother is upset and spreading false information about the situation. You did not uninvite A because of his autism, but rather expressed concern about being able to provide proper care for him. It's also understandable that A's mother would want some alone time, but that doesn't mean that it's appropriate to leave her child in a situation where he may become overwhelmed and require additional attention.\n\nIt's good that the parents who are staying have offered to help with A, but it may be worth reaching out to A's mother to explain your concerns and see if there is a compromise that can be reached. Perhaps she can arrange for someone else to supervise A or provide additional support. Ultimately, the most important thing is ensuring that A is safe and comfortable at the party.", "NTA. I feel for her, but your concerns are completely valid. I don't think I'd be comfortable with it either, unless he was the child of a close friend. And I'm amazed the mom is so eager to leave him with a stranger. I get needing a break, but he's still her baby. I don't think I could have done that. I'd tell her you're sorry but he can't sleep over, he's still welcome to come to the party before the sleepover.", "NTA. The mother is wanting a break if he's low functioning. Based on her reaction. But it's not right to dump him on someone that hasn't delt with him at a birthday party. Maybe a couple play dates in the future and try again. Glad you raised your daughter not to judge.", "NTA. Of course it's difficult for her, but you have to think of what's best for this child.  It wouldn't do him any favors to put him in an uncomfortable situation without someone able to help him properly.", "NTA. Her being a single mother doesn\u2019t mean jack in this situation. You\u2019re watching THIRTY other kids. If the autistic kid has a melt down she\u2019d be throwing you under the bus for not watching them enough. And I say this as a borderline autistic person", "I have an Autistic son. He's not super low functioning, but he's not high functioning either.  And the only place he can spend the night is my mother's house.  And sometimes he still needs to come home.  Out in public, I can give some space, but if he needs me, he always knows where to find me. And he sounds better off than this kid. Nta", "NTA.\n\nI would never dream of doing such a thing with my ASD child.\n\nThe mum knows this is hard, and is a major AH for expecting someone with no experience who is also hosting a load of other kids, to be able to do what is needed to keep her kid safe in every aspect of the term.\n\nIf feeling bad you could offer to have kid over for a playdate another time - but tell her that in this instance the sleepover isn't happening and she can not leave her kid there without adequate provision for their needs. Any other parent that has an issue can be asked if they are willing to step up and take on the responsibility.", "Info:\n\nHow much do you know about A's condition? You say that you believe he is low-functioning, but that doesn't have a real meaning in regards to how well he can handle a sleep over. If you have been around A enough to know you cannot handle him, then N  t a. However, if you really don't know much about A, you should have asked for more information before making a decision. I don't think it makes you TA that you didn't, but it would've been better if you had. \n\nIt looks like your fears were confirmed after the fact by another parent. But in the future I would try to get more information before making a decision, as autism and other conditions have such a wide range of presentation that you can't really make a judgement based on the diagnosis alone.", "INFO - your child asked for A to be invited, right?\nYou knew A is autistic before you invited them, right?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a child who regularly had a big party and then five or six close friends stay over, I wouldn\u2019t be happy that someone is inviting themselves over to my sleepovers.

You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know his special requirements.

You have 30 kids and a pool. Who will be doing life guard duty? She's being unreasonable, and quite frankly it's a safety risk.", "NTA", "Exactly this! Yes it\u2019s hard to be a single mom, I have nothing but respect for single moms, but you cannot just expect someone to have your (apparently highly-hands on) autistic child 24 hours AND on a sleepover when they are also attending 30 other kids and have zero experience. That\u2019s an asshole move. And so is asking if he can stay, and then throwing a temper tantrum when the answer is no.", "NTA\n\nI am a mom of an autistic daughter. I would never leave my daughter alone at a party and she is older than 8 years old. Most of the time my daughter can manage without me but at parties there is a lot of noise and other triggers and she needs me for support. If the mom of the autistic boy really wants him to attend she should attend the party with him.", "I am really surprised at your judgement. Not all autistic people have the same needs. The right thing to do is to ASK what the child will need, not assume. That's just bias and it's gross. Possibly the needs are low. YTA.", "People also seem to slightly skim over the fact it's a sorta pool party. Why would you want your child with someone I'll equipped to take care of them. Especially if there is a pool. Supervision is key at kid pool parties. A's mother would be putting them in possible actual danger. All because they feel entitled to free childcare", "Also, the audacity to pull the \u201csingle moms don\u2019t get a break\u201d card when OOP is literally a single father doing the exact same job she is", "She still can\u2019t just drop him off. OP has no experience and the kid appears to need constant supervision. On top of that, there\u2019s a pool and a bounce house. Even if he was willing, the mom would not come back to get her kid.", "Lol I'm an autistic adult and I would not want to go to a pool party with a sleepover. Pools make me nervous and that's just way too long away from my house and my dog and my own bed.", "That's your child, not hers. Maybe her child has fewer needs than yours but we'll never know because OP thinks that all autistic children have high needs.", "I mean, I agree that she does not need to have this kid to her house, but you realize that not everyone with autism is the same as the one kid you know with autism, right?", "So he should just roll the dice and hope that this kid does fine under his care for an overnight visit? That's one hell of a gamble.", "OP invited the kid. The mother is lying and telling everyone OP disinvited him. The kid was always invited to attend all events provided his mother be there with him. \n\nOP has every right to say he has no experience in taking on a child with higher needs and the mother is disgusting for trying to force someone to be her free babysitter, regardless of what impact that may have on her child and the other children there.", ">it sounds like you have enough hands on deck.\n\nWhere did you get that impression? OP mentioned that some parents are staying, but didn't mention how many. And OP is only actual host of the party.", "OP doesn\u2019t need to seek more info. He is hosting a kid\u2019s birthday party. Anyone who has done that knows you are running around with your head cut off majority of the time. That is NOT the time to take on extra responsibility of an autistic child\u2019s wellbeing. \n\nI feel for the mom. She obviously doesn\u2019t have a support system and can\u2019t afford regular babysitting. However, she has the opportunity to build a support system. She could have attended the birthday party like other adults were doing. Get to know the other parents, have them get to know her and her son. Maybe next party he can attend without her. She\u2019s going the absolute wrong way about this.", "OP says the child is low functioning and that another parent who was left with this child said they were a handful. OP knows their limits and that they would be unable to cope. Nothing bias about it at all.", "i second this, as was he even specifically invited to the sleepover?", "Well, not _exactly_ the same, since OP's kid isn't autistic. But yeah, still pretty audacious.", "I am really sad about this thread and that you are getting so many downvotes. I have an autistic child and the fact that OP won't make any effort to learn about this child so he can possibly include him is so disheartening. I can't believe how many parents of autistic kids agree with him!", "What about \u201clow functioning\u201d and easily overwhelmed makes it seem like A has less needs? Even the other parents who\u2019ve had experience with A say he\u2019s a handful. The mom is out of line.", "Isn't he taking on the well-being of ALL the invited children, though? Kids who aren't autistic can have different and unique needs, too. I agree she's going about things the wrong way. But not all autistic kids are necessarily going to need any extra attention as any other kid.\n\nMaybe there's going to be a kid who has nightmares, but isn't autistic. Or a kid who throws a tantrum, but isn't autistic. Maybe there's a kid who's highly sensitive and gets upset easily when they're tired, but isn't autistic. Or a kid who's being mean and upsetting the other kids, but isn't autistic. Meanwhile the autistic kid might be well prepared, listens to instructions, but just talks about Minecraft a little more obsessively than the other kids. We don't know. It's worth asking the questions at least.", "None of that is what's suggested by A's monther - they simply wanted to drop him off at an unfamiliar place with people he doesn't know and come back a day later.", "I'm Autistic.\n\nI'm fairly \"high functioning.\"\n\nMy mother sent me to live with my Grandmother for a week.\n\nTwice.\n\nBecause she needed \"a break.\"\n\nMy grandmother is a kind and lovely woman, she has good food, jigsaws and puzzles.\n\nI was so traumatised by the experience I ended up not speaking to my mother for a few years. (There was one other thing she did, but these two events fractured my relationship with her)\n\nI couldn't sleep, the new room was just too much. There were holes in the wall I'd stare at for hours expecting things to crawl through.\n\nThe only saving grace was that one time my Grandfather who couldn't speak English, thus was a very quiet man, took me to a calm and quiet park to watch him feed the ducks for a few hours. Was literally the only positive I have about being thrust into a new home for a week without warning.", "My child has an autistic classmate. Her dad always stays at birthday parties. \n\nThe child had to leave her own birthday party part way through because it was too stimulating. (The party was also nowhere near as stimulating as what OP has planned, it was a sedate affair at home with five kids and there was no pool.) You know what? Her parents had planned for that possibility making sure that there was a quiet room for their kid and enough adults for the rest of the kids. \n\nThey know and respect their kid and were also thoughtful about the other kids.\n\nNTA. Also if you haven\u2019t already, I\u2019d suggest you hire a lifeguard.", "How about OP just talks to the mom to find out what the needs are? The bias against autistic kids on this thread is disgusting.", "The kid's mom is the one trying to dump her child on OP without even an attempt at working with him to make this a good experience for all concerned. \n\nThis is OP's daughter's party, with 29 other kids in attendance, not her personal babysitter service. Had she offered to stay for the first few hours, ease her son into the experience, make sure he has everything he needs, and OP had rejected that, I'd agree with you. But it's fairly clear she doesn't care for anything except her shot at a free afternoon and night.", "right?! jeez i just tried scrolling through the comments again and i might be missing them, but i still don't see anybody else saying this is unusual...wtf? it's definitely not normal", "Oh lord - make this a stand-alone comment, please!! This needs to be seen\n\nCan you imagine the blood and fire from the evisceration if OP switched genders and as a single dad said this to a single mom hosting!??? We\u2019d have to shut off our phones to avoid them being damaged!!!", "Facts", "He's not caring for 30 kids by himself and he admits he doesn't really know what the kids needs are.", "No, it means it's hard for to have alone time and she is probably sick of other parents making assumptions about her kid.", "Because it's a point of view not reflected in the post and not relevant. \n\nChild A's parent wants to drop him off at an unfamiliar place and come back a day later, and rejects any compromise.\n\nMeandwe123 said 'what's wrong with dropping A off at the party and seeing how they fare?' which isn't in the conversation.\n\nIt's not an unacceptable viewpoint but it isn't on the table from the mother and therefore doesn't further the conversation.", "It happens pretty often around here, once there's a few downvotes on someone's comment everyone decides the person is wrong forever", "OP was told by another attendee's parent that A is a handful without trained supervision, and he didn't have a problem inviting A with supervision. OP operated with limited but clear idea on how A behaved on previous outings, and he isn't comfortable taking on the responsibility of A and 29 other kids on a sleepover. The fact that the mother than went around lying through her teeth about the invitation probably said a lot more of the mother's character."]}
