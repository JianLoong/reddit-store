I plan on doing other activities as well, such as bounce houses,cookout, s'mores, movie by the pool, make your own cookies, etc., followed by a sleepover with some of her friends. It's gonna be a busy day, and there'll be roughly 30 kids at my house. Some parents are staying, and some are just dropping off their kids and picking them up later. I'm fine with this.\n\nI let G invited whoever she wanted, and she chose to invite a classmate, A, that is autistic. I was fine with this, as I've always taught G not to judge others based on their differences. \n\nHere is where my dilemma comes into play. A's mother called me last week to ask if it would okay just to drop off him and pick him up the next day so he could attend the sleepover. My problem is I have no experience with an autistic child, and my understanding is A is very low functioning. I guess he's prone to getting easily overwhelmed and will start to shutdown/outburst. \n\nI told A's mom that I wouldn't be comfortable with him being there by himself as I would be too busy with everything else going on and am inexperienced with autistic children.

Autistic mom of someone on the spectrum, here. She wants a free babysitter. Shame on her for even attempting this. Folks on the spectrum are often traumatized by untrained supervision/a lack of supervision. If she needs a night off, she can seek out the many services provided for Autistic folk or talk to her own family/friends.", "NTA, a reasonable compromise would be having A attend a few parts of the party and then leave prior to the sleepover. You aren't excluding or uninviting him, just recognizing you're not equipped to provide enough support. Especially since you'll have 29 other young children to watch! Seems like A's mom is just looking for a free night.", "NTA. As a single mom of an autistic child who hasn\u2019t had a break in a month, I would never consider leaving him at a birthday party for people he\u2019s not familiar with to take care of him. A\u2019s mother is an ass\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have to miss out\u2026 she can bring him and stay to take care of him.", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to turn you into respite care, and that\u2019s going to be a bad time for all involved.", "NTA it\u2019s the day of YOUR child\u2019s birthday, you will be entertaining and being pulled in so many directions. I personally would not feel comfortable either. Maybe they can get together for a sleep over when it\u2019s not as much going on?", "NTA and honestly, I question the judgement of the mother, who would send her autistic child to an overnight with people she doesn\u2019t know and to a place he\u2019s not familiar with.  I mean *maybe* a hour or so during the party, after making sure he\u2019s doing ok and several of the parents have her number. But this sounds like a 12+ hour affair.  No. That\u2019s a bad choice you\u2019re saving the mom from making.", "NTA. Your claim is that caring for a low functioning autistic child is different from caring for neurotypical children. This is a pretty uncontroversial claim. You aren\u2019t willing / able to care for A for an overnight. That doesn\u2019t sound strange to me, particularly if A is a lot of work to care for and you lack any relevant training. A\u2019s mother\u2019s reaction is telling - the fact that she played the \u201csingle mother alone time\u201d card shows you how she looks at these overnight parties, and that she\u2019s more concerned with getting a night off than setting her son up for success in his social life.", "NTA. You aren't equipped to handle him without his mother present. That isn't unreasonable.", "NTA - you\u2019re both protecting your child\u2019s ability to enjoy party AND protecting A by telling their mom that you aren\u2019t comfortable being a caretaker for A.\n\nBoundaries are ok", "Holy crap, she's an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer child needs her there and she's refusing to do her job as his mother? bleugh.\n\nI have 2 kids on the spectrum and while one of them was fine being left at parties if i wanted to leave her there (i didn't always..  depended on the kid and parents in question),  the other definitely couldn't be left.\n\nI was always there to supervise and make sure he and others had fun -  that was literally my job as his parent.     I'd have felt awful if i'd done any differently and either him or his friends or parents had struggled because of it.\n\nYes it's difficult being a single parent -  but it's even more difficult being a child on the spectrum that can't navigate social situations or cope without supervision. \n\nIf she's struggling more than she can handle,  she needs to reach out for assistance to social services or somewhere..    not just dump her child on people that have no experience and could end in disaster.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and I feel bad for A, because he was born from an AH.\n\nI can understand a parent in her situation needing sympathy...but once she pulled that crap, let her deal with it on her own. Block her.", "NTA. She has some nerve.", "NTA.\n\nWhen she said that you don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time, she exposed her intentions to have you as baby sitter for a full 24 hours.\n\nI am very high functioning autistic and I'm a handful even in the burgeoning twilight of my life.  There are potential triggers there that even mom hasn't thought of since this is uncharted territory.  I feel as an autistic man who has more or less learned to cope that if mother cannot be there for a couple of hours for her own autistic child that it can be construed as abuse.  I certainly feel that way, because I have some idea of what can happen with an autistic child in unfamiliar surroundings, from both the child's side and the neurotypical adult's side.\n\nDo not back down under any circumstances.  The child is invited if she's present at all times.  An hour or two should be enough for him.  He will indicate when he is overwhelmed.  Since the neighbourhood knows what has happened it should be easy to have several adults chaperone the mother so that she does not skip out.  She does not get a free babysitter overnight.  If she introduces a babysitter at the ready in the event that he gets overwhelmed and wants to go home, then the problem can be considered solved and you've reached a win/win consensus.", "NTA. She's using this opportunity as a babysitter/free time for herself. At 8, I'd have never let my (autistic) son be left in that situation. She asked you answered honestly, and now she's pissed and petty that you're unwilling to care for her child for 12-18 hours.", "NTA. This poor kid\u2019s mother is a big A though for making it about her.", "Based on the information provided, it seems that you are NTA for not feeling comfortable with having A attend the party without adult supervision. It's understandable that you don't have experience with autistic children and that you're concerned about not being able to properly care for him amidst the other activities and guests.\n\nIt's unfortunate that A's mother is upset and spreading false information about the situation. You did not uninvite A because of his autism, but rather expressed concern about being able to provide proper care for him. It's also understandable that A's mother would want some alone time, but that doesn't mean that it's appropriate to leave her child in a situation where he may become overwhelmed and require additional attention.\n\nIt's good that the parents who are staying have offered to help with A, but it may be worth reaching out to A's mother to explain your concerns and see if there is a compromise that can be reached. Perhaps she can arrange for someone else to supervise A or provide additional support. Ultimately, the most important thing is ensuring that A is safe and comfortable at the party.", "NTA. I feel for her, but your concerns are completely valid. I don't think I'd be comfortable with it either, unless he was the child of a close friend. And I'm amazed the mom is so eager to leave him with a stranger. I get needing a break, but he's still her baby. I don't think I could have done that. I'd tell her you're sorry but he can't sleep over, he's still welcome to come to the party before the sleepover.", "NTA. The mother is wanting a break if he's low functioning. Based on her reaction. But it's not right to dump him on someone that hasn't delt with him at a birthday party. Maybe a couple play dates in the future and try again. Glad you raised your daughter not to judge.", "NTA. Of course it's difficult for her, but you have to think of what's best for this child.  It wouldn't do him any favors to put him in an uncomfortable situation without someone able to help him properly.", "NTA. Her being a single mother doesn\u2019t mean jack in this situation. You\u2019re watching THIRTY other kids. If the autistic kid has a melt down she\u2019d be throwing you under the bus for not watching them enough. And I say this as a borderline autistic person", "I have an Autistic son. He's not super low functioning, but he's not high functioning either.  And the only place he can spend the night is my mother's house.  And sometimes he still needs to come home.  Out in public, I can give some space, but if he needs me, he always knows where to find me. And he sounds better off than this kid. Nta", "NTA.\n\nI would never dream of doing such a thing with my ASD child.\n\nThe mum knows this is hard, and is a major AH for expecting someone with no experience who is also hosting a load of other kids, to be able to do what is needed to keep her kid safe in every aspect of the term.\n\nIf feeling bad you could offer to have kid over for a playdate another time - but tell her that in this instance the sleepover isn't happening and she can not leave her kid there without adequate provision for their needs. Any other parent that has an issue can be asked if they are willing to step up and take on the responsibility.", "Info:\n\nHow much do you know about A's condition? You say that you believe he is low-functioning, but that doesn't have a real meaning in regards to how well he can handle a sleep over. If you have been around A enough to know you cannot handle him, then N  t a. However, if you really don't know much about A, you should have asked for more information before making a decision. I don't think it makes you TA that you didn't, but it would've been better if you had. \n\nIt looks like your fears were confirmed after the fact by another parent. But in the future I would try to get more information before making a decision, as autism and other conditions have such a wide range of presentation that you can't really make a judgement based on the diagnosis alone.", "INFO - your child asked for A to be invited, right?\nYou knew A is autistic before you invited them, right?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you did the responsible thing.", "NTA\n\nsounds like this child\u2019s mother just invited him to a sleepover that he was never invited to to begin with. That\u2019s pretty rude and entitled. As a child who regularly had a big party and then five or six close friends stay over, I wouldn\u2019t be happy that someone is inviting themselves over to my sleepovers.

You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know his special requirements.

You would be doing a disservice to the child by putting him in a situation without appropriate care (or rather, the mother would be doing it to him, and you by proxy). \n\nNot to mention the fact he could lash out and injure the other children at the party as well as himself, which will now open you up to lawsuits from the other parents. And since you know he's a \"problem\" and you allowed him there unsupervised, you would likely be found negligent. Don't dismiss this possibility, as there is most assuredly at least one person in that parent group that would go for the money grab if it was available. And the most likely candidate would be the mother of the autistic child. \n\nMy advice would be do not allow him to attend without his parent present.

There's quite a lot of variance on what autism actually looks like in an individual. Some NT kids are gonna struggle with sleepover parties and some aren't. Some autistic kids are going to struggle with sleepover parties and some aren't. Other adults are also going to be there. It sounds like the OP's concerns are reasonable in this case and with the way the mum is reacting, even if she would say, \"He won't require any special treatment\" I'm not sure how trustworthy those words would be.\n\nBut just as a general statement about autism, knowing they have an autism diagnosis alone isn't enough to justify excluding them. (Knowing he has a tendency for meltdowns does justify a condition that his parent needs to be there.) If the mother's judgement was trustworthy, the only question he needs to ask is, \"Will he require any special treatment?\" And if the answer is \"Yes\", then \"I won't be able to manage that, you need to be there.\" If the answer is \"No\" I guess it goes down to whether or not OP has good reason to not trust her judgement.\n\nBut every parent dropping off their kid is making a judgement about whether or not the kid can handle the party, and the OP is making a choice to trust all the other parents' judgements.", "\ud83d\ude19", "I don't think that's the only reason, it's one of many.

It\u2019s one thing if it was just my child going and you said you were okay with them staying without me. However, dumping a special needs child on anyone, is a crappy thing to do. It is very exhausting sometimes and an unfamiliar environment can be overstimulating for a child on the spectrum. I\u2019m absolutely floored by that mother\u2019s behavior. You are definitely NOT the a-hole!", "Nta. It's not your job to babysit other peoples kids in the way she was trying to put her child off on you.

You think your problems start with am autistic child attending this party? \nThe whole setup is strange.You throw a party with pool AND baking AND bounce houses AND whatnot? Every single one of those activities is potentially dangerous. You will need a lot of people being in charge to prevent 30 ! children from drowning, banging their heads, jumping forcefully onto each other or burning their fingers with the hot oven. Will you hire safety guards? Or let everybody sign a form which says you take no responsibility whatsoever?  You cannot rely on the other parents. They will stand somewhere talking, with their backs to the pool. \nLater on you expect most of the children to leave while a handful will be allowed to stay for the sleepover. Are you aware that all children that are not the \"chosen ones\" will be sad and jealous? And that they potentially will blame your child? \nAs for the autistic boy: The best way to handle this would have been to talk to his mother beforehand to discuss his needs and so on. You could have told her then what you expect from her, too. Even now you could invite her over with some of the parents who offered to help with the boy to find a solution. But you don't even try, do you? You just go \"autistic? No thanks\" despite the fact that you know nearly nothing about him. There are a lot of different types of autism and the fact that the other parents offered to help makes me guess that they know him better and think it would be OK. It is nice that you allowed your daughter to invite who she wants, but she DID invite him straight away and now you basically take the invitation back, which is cruel.\nAll in all I get the impression that the party is a lot about you and your house and the pool and  your money. You look forward to have a lot of people around, like having a private summer festival, but you did not think enough about how to manage all of this. It should be all about your daughter and her friendships. She is nine years old! As children are she might even be the one who is suddenly overwhelmed and won't enjoy it any more. Based on the rule \"one guest for every year you lived so far\" a party of nine children would have been enough. There are years to come where this kind of event will be much easier to handle. Without bouncing houses.", "NTA, but you are failing to see a simple solution.  ASK HIS MOTHER WHAT HE NEEDS.\n\nI\u2019m autistic and so is my child.  I get it.  You\u2019re nervous about his unpredictable behavior.  And his mom should not be using you as her respite care.  But you could have done way more to mitigate the possibility of issues arising at the party so he can be included.  Here are some things you can do/ask:\n\nSet up a calm down room or area where he can go if he gets overwhelmed.  If he has a stuffed animal or a blanket, make sure his mom brings it.  Ask his mom what his triggers are.  Would a clown jumping out of the bushes scare him?  What about other loud noises?  How does this child communicate?  Can he talk reasonably well or does he gesture?  Does he know other kids at the party?  Does he have issues with other classmates that may be attending that bully him?  What about a pool?  Can this child swim?  Find out!!\n\nIt\u2019s a lot, yes.

This is a situation I personally would not compromise on, 30 kids is too many overnight to take on this child unfortunately and compromises the safety of everyone including the autistic kiddo especially with there being a pool involved. Being a single mom is hard, being a single mom to a child that has additional needs is harder but that does not give the mother the right to force her child on others that are not equipped to assist properly.\n\nOP offered a good compromise on having her stay with her child. It\u2019s not as good for her mental health to not get a full break but she could use the opportunity to teach OP & others how to help her child have the least stressful time possible making it easier for others to accommodate her kiddo later\u2026 leading to more potential opportunities for breaks.", "It was amazing how quickly a gaggle of spectrum-moms were trying to set up unsupervised play dates once word got out in our new town that my wife had ECE training and experience.\n\n No  Candice, freely babysitting your (admittedly very sweet, but) barely-verbal non toilet trained 8 year old does not sound like \"a fun Saturday\" to us.

Why? Are you familiar with every autistic child and with their behavior at parties, and therefore able to draw a rational conclusion that every single one of them has additional support needs at parties?\n\nI really cannot comprehend the replies in this thread. It would be one thing if OP knew for certain that the classmate did not do well in party environments or had support needs which would be substantially above and beyond what most children might have at a party. But the thing that I feel like everyone is ignoring here is that we don\u2019t have any evidence that this child would struggle at a party. Literally all the information we have is OP saying that his understanding is that the child can get overwhelmed and start to shutdown. OP has no idea what things overwhelm the child, or what the child\u2019s shutdowns look like. It seems like everyone is assuming that the mother is an awful mother willing to let her kid suffer for some alone time, but nobody is considering that maybe she just knows her kids needs/triggers better than OP does??\n\nI\u2019m autistic and can get overstimulated in some situations, but I loved parties as a kid and rarely felt overwhelmed at them. They just were usually not a source of overstimulation for me based on my particular sensory sensitivities. And if I did have a shutdown for some reason at a party or sleepover or whatever, I would either pull out a book and read until I calmed down or I would literally just call my parents and go home. In fact, despite having autism and a bunch of it\u2019s comorbid conditions, I was frequently the best-behaved child at any party because I was an anxious little nerd who followed the rules. \n\nOf course, not all autistic children are like me, and some undoubtedly have a very difficult time at parties. But my point is that all autistic children are different and have unique needs, and it\u2019s not appropriate for OP (and everyone else commenting here) to make assumptions about what this particular child\u2019s needs are. Maybe this kid is like me and thrives at parties.  \n\nMaking assumptions about someone\u2019s interests and abilities based solely on their diagnosis, and then saying they aren\u2019t allowed to attend a party without their parents (even though other children without that diagnosis are being allowed to attend without their parents), is the very definition of discrimination. \n\nIf the classmate has support needs that would truly make it difficult for OP to care for both him and the other children (even with the assistance of the other parents who have offered to help) then OP isn\u2019t in the wrong for insisting that his mother be there. But what is wrong is OP, and many of the commenters here, declaring that a child automatically needs to follow different rules than the other children solely because the child has a particular diagnosis. It\u2019s not inherently entitled for the parents of an Autistic child to expect their child to be treated like every other child in certain situations. That\u2019s only entitled if the child actually needs additional care in those particular circumstances, which is simply not always the case.", "From the timeline OP gave us, it sounds like OP didn\u2019t discuss the situation with that other parent until AFTER he declared that the classmate had to follow different rules than the other children solely because he had a particular diagnosis. \n\nTo me, an assessment that the kid can be a \u201chandful\u201d (from a third party who has watched the child only once and may have biases of their own) isn\u2019t exactly strong evidence that the child has additional support needs. But even if we assume that\u2019s true, it doesn\u2019t change the fact that OP made assumptions about the child before he knew that. And also that all of the commenters here are making even more general assumptions, saying things like \u201cI would never leave an autistic child alone at a party.\u201d Like okay but why??? Do you know all autistic children and therefore you\u2019re in a position to determine that every single one of them has additional support needs at parties??? \n\nMaking assumptions about people because of their disability, and treating them differently as a result, is discrimination. End of story. Just because it might in some cases be true that an autistic child has additional support needs at parties does not make it right for people to assume that\u2019s true for all autistic children.

That's...a concerning level of disregard for her kid. I get that respite is hard to come by but that doesn't mean you drop kick your kid into the first opportunity that comes up no matter how inappropriate it is for them. Every autistic kid is different, meaning even if you had some experience you may be at a complete loss when it comes to this specific child. You never know what an individual child's needs might be and if something went wrong you would have zero clue how to handle it, and it sounds like mom cares more about her alone time so I would not trust her to be responsive if you called.\n\nNTA. She's being selfish and I am kinda worried about the disregard she seems to have for her child's well being.", "soooo a single mom told you, a single father, that you don't understand how hard it is to get alone time???", "You need to do what\u2019s right for you and your household. No way any parent should just leave their children behind if the child isn\u2019t self sufficient. Anyone that\u2019s throwing shade can suck it and you should tell them so. No need for \u201ckid gloves\u201d with adults. You are most definitely NTA! Happy Bornday to your baby girl!", "Well that title certainly doesn't reflect the reality of the post, good lord.\n\nWow, okay so for starters: NTA\n\nYou have a valid concern and it really seems like she's trying to pawn her son off onto you as a free babysitter. Not okay at all.", "NTA\nIf something happened during the party and A had a meltdown guess whose fault would that be. She doesn't want her son to be at the party. She wants a free babysitter. She literally said this to you. If you feel you can't handle an autistic child on your own you shouldn't agree to take care of one.", "NTA. There is the obvious that this mother was incredibly rude to even ask. But this is a pool party. One common symptom of autism is lack of fear in potentially dangerous situations. This child could go jumping in the deep end and what if no one saw him in time? My sister did this at a pool party in which my mom was there to supervise. This party was also nothing but autistic children with teachers, aides and parents present and there was still almost a disaster.", "Definitely NTA. Don't get influenced by white knights this easy. All they want are sympathy points at this point. You are right. You can't take care of a low functioning autistic kid with 30 others running around nor when less are over and sleeping. Children with special needs need people with special training/experience to make sure their day goes as best as possible. \n\nOf course it's hard for her. That's why many services exist to relieve parents. Maybe BD can come and watch the son (he's gone isn't he?). Otherwise, well, her wish for a day/night alone is what uninvited her son.", "NTA that's a lot to ask of a parent who does not really know her kid, especially if her kid is on the autism spectrum.  She really should be there with him for the party, and once you get to know both of them better, he could join a future sleepover.  You don't know if he has sensory issues, or food issues, or anything, or how to work with him if he gets overwhelmed.  It's for her son's benefit too, how comfortable would he be at a big party without his mom and staying overnight?  Probably not very.\n\nI hope you pointed out that you are a single parent too, and let everyone know that you did not uninvite the kid, just didn't feel comfortable with the mom leaving him with you all day and night.", "NTA:\n\nLow functioning autism can be very difficult even if you are experienced in handling it and it is a child you're familiar with. They may be prone to attacking other children or themselves when they are overwhelmed, frustrated, or in a melt down.\n\nThe mother seems very unconcerned with her child and just in wanting a night off :\\\\", "I\u2019m a parent of a autistic 5 year old and you are NTA. It\u2019s unfair of her to use you as a baby sitter/ respite worker. She needs to be there with her son. There\u2019s no way I would just leave my son at a party without staying. Especially a sleep over. You have enough to worry about", "Also a parent of an autistic child and I agree this this. You didn\u2019t uninvite him. It breaks my heart that he has to experience this disappointment but mom absolutely wanted a free babysitter.", "You aren't a community service and it's not your issue that it's difficult for a single mother. She's trying to make you feel guilty about her life. It's her issue and if she needs a break, she needs to do something herself, not try to place the burden on others who don't know what they are doing. She doesn't care if you or her child has a difficult night. I do understand how difficult it can be but the world isn't her free babysitter. NTA.", "1000% this even with the parent there if the child gets overwhelmed things could get ugly. I had a friend that threw a birthday party years ago her son invited a autistic classmate. He started out doing really well then something happend and all the presents ended up in the pool before anyone could stop him. He gave me a lot of hotdogs too. He was a sweet kid. Shit happens.", "Yeah, I was gonna go for Y T A but absolutely NTA after reading the mother refused to stay.\nOP did a fantastic job of trying to find solutions for the kiddo to partake and it is a shame the mother has fucked it up.", "For real.  I wouldn't do this to family, let alone someone I barely know.  It's hard enough trying to curb a meltdown under normal circumstances, but I can't imagine a stranger trying to navigate one.  It's tough enough when a neuro typical kid you're barely aquatinted with comes to you crying.  Good lord.  The woman might as well drop off a couple of large untrained dogs while she's at it.", "Absolutely. And it's mom's fault her kiddo is disappointed... Mom could go to the party too, so kiddo won't be disappointed or miss out, but she refuses.", "Because it\u2019s for the good of the kids and showing his daughter to be compassionate and compromising to include all people by getting past the moms mistake to find a solution for the KIDS", "That\u2019s exactly what I was afraid of too. She\u2019s already spreading lies, and other parents are believing her.  OP needs to be careful about what she would accuse him of next if something else doesn\u2019t go her way.", "NTA first of all that\u2019s too old for a boy/girl sleepover. Even if she did drop him off it should just be for the afternoon part. She just wants free babysitting. She\u2019s probably overwhelmed herself and needs a break but this isn\u2019t the way to get it.  I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s willing to risk her son like that. You don\u2019t know this child well enough to handle his needs. If she wants him to attend,\nShe can come with him to the afternoon party", "NTA. I\u2019m a single mom of a neurotypical 8 yo and I NEVER leave him alone for parties. And\u2026*there\u2019s a pool*.  I\u2019d be there the entire time, eyes glued to the pool. \n\nShe may be tired, but she\u2019s the ass.", "Dad here with a autistic son... I'm lucky to still be with my wife. Mine is 8, our only child and is high functioning.... But scared by hair/hand driers. Still in nappies/diapers and he has very strong emo... Leading to a lot of white fibbing but also breakdown when upset....\n\nWe are so glad that he gets invited to some parties but in no way shape of form would we dump him there... One of us will always be there for general help as well as a direct assistant for him.  (We are not expecting any parent to have to change him)..\n\nNTA deffo but I have sympathy for this mum, no excuses for what she has done but she in need of major support and is most likely desperate.... I hope she can find services around her at someone as a autistic child is tough enough with two parents full time...", "My dad was with my brother at birthday party's so they could pull him out in case he had a meltdown", "NTA\n\nA party is not the time to leave an autistic child for a mommy alone time, she needs to hire a babysitter who knows how to care for autistic kids", "Another mom of spectrum kiddos. NTA at all. I ALWAYS stayed at parties when they were small. Ditching him for a SLEEPOVER? Hell, no, that would be so stressful for the kid. Yes, getting time to yourself is hard. This is what PARENTING is.", "When we moved into a house with a pool, my father arranged to have a co-worker\u2019s wife, certified to teach Red Cross Lifesaving, run a course using our pool. Invitations to the class were sent to all the kids in our subdivision who were old enough to get certified. In order to swim with me unsupervised, they had to pass the class. I think we ended up with 20-some kids in the class. Everyone passed except my neighbor\u2019s older daughter (her younger brother passed). If she wanted to swim, she had to bring a parent with her.\n\n(Dad was a lawyer; mom was in and out of the hospital dying from cancer. I was 12, loved the water, and swam like a fish. Between his work and needing to be with mom, I was home alone, a lot. They weren\u2019t going to deny me use of the pool, but they were damn sure going to do their best to ensure that I, and anyone I invited to join me, knew how to be safe and what to do in an emergency.)\n\nThere is no way I would allow that child to attend a pool party at my home without his mother in attendance. Whether he comes, or not, I hope that, at minimum, OP has arranged for at least one of the other adults there to act as a lifeguard, with a second to spell them when they need to step away. That pool should *never* be left unattended during the party with that many kids running around.\n\nNTA.", "This was the exact scenario when a 4 year old drowned at Tommy Lee's kid's birthday part. \n\nForty adults but since no one was specifically designed to watch each kid, the drowning occurred.\n\nUnless a lifeguard is hired, it is madness and a huge potential liability for there to be swimming at the party.\n\nMaybe the next morning when there are fewer kids and there are adults who can just be at the pool making sure every kid is safe.", "Also, why is nobody mentioning the fact it's not appropriate for 8 year olds to have sleepovers with kids of the opposite sex? I see boys having boys sleep over and vise versa, but I'd never let my son sleep over at a girls that wasn't family.", "It would just be a nice thing to do. Takes a special kind of person to do something kind for someone who wronged them. Obviously you're not one of those people.", "Truth. Sad.", "My daughters best friend from the age of 5 (now 15) is raised by a single dad.     \nShe has sleepovers, spends weekends, goes on daytrips with them (and the friend with us).       \nSo many people are shocked I allow her over there. I always ask 'if it was a single mum would you be saying this?'        \nThe man is an angel. I work as does my husband and friends dad has done emergency childcare and school pick up many times.      \nHe's great with the kids. I have zero issues with him at all.      \nI hate how people act around single dads.", "I host sleepovers for my 10 y/o niece and her friends every few months. Yeah, they don't think about sex. But they do talk about which one has a boyfriend, if anyone has kissed a boy before, which boy is cutest, etc. Curiosity at their age is normal, as is kids pushing boundaries. Having coed sleepovers isn't something most parents approve of. But Reddit won't reflect that because the majority of users are still underage children themselves.", "I would be at the DAs office demanding whomever made the report be charged with filing a false report. Before someone says that's an overreaction you need to factor in that any time you call the police on someone you are risking every single persons life who is there when the cops show up."]}
