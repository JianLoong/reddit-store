I plan on doing other activities as well, such as bounce houses,cookout, s'mores, movie by the pool, make your own cookies, etc., followed by a sleepover with some of her friends. It's gonna be a busy day, and there'll be roughly 30 kids at my house. Some parents are staying, and some are just dropping off their kids and picking them up later. I'm fine with this.\n\nI let G invited whoever she wanted, and she chose to invite a classmate, A, that is autistic. I was fine with this, as I've always taught G not to judge others based on their differences. \n\nHere is where my dilemma comes into play. A's mother called me last week to ask if it would okay just to drop off him and pick him up the next day so he could attend the sleepover. My problem is I have no experience with an autistic child, and my understanding is A is very low functioning. I guess he's prone to getting easily overwhelmed and will start to shutdown/outburst. \n\nI told A's mom that I wouldn't be comfortable with him being there by himself as I would be too busy with everything else going on and am inexperienced with autistic children. A's mother got really upset with me, telling me I don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time, and how A would be devastated that he wouldn't be able to attend and how happy he was to attend a party, since he rarely gets invited to things., among other things. \n\nA's mom is now going around saying I \"uninvited \" her son because of his autism, causing parents to throw shade at me. The parents that are staying offered to help with A, but they also have little to no experience with autistic children either.

Autistic mom of someone on the spectrum, here. She wants a free babysitter. Shame on her for even attempting this. Folks on the spectrum are often traumatized by untrained supervision/a lack of supervision. If she needs a night off, she can seek out the many services provided for Autistic folk or talk to her own family/friends.", "NTA, a reasonable compromise would be having A attend a few parts of the party and then leave prior to the sleepover. You aren't excluding or uninviting him, just recognizing you're not equipped to provide enough support. Especially since you'll have 29 other young children to watch! Seems like A's mom is just looking for a free night.", "NTA. As a single mom of an autistic child who hasn\u2019t had a break in a month, I would never consider leaving him at a birthday party for people he\u2019s not familiar with to take care of him. A\u2019s mother is an ass\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have to miss out\u2026 she can bring him and stay to take care of him.", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to turn you into respite care, and that\u2019s going to be a bad time for all involved.", "NTA it\u2019s the day of YOUR child\u2019s birthday, you will be entertaining and being pulled in so many directions. I personally would not feel comfortable either. Maybe they can get together for a sleep over when it\u2019s not as much going on?", "NTA and honestly, I question the judgement of the mother, who would send her autistic child to an overnight with people she doesn\u2019t know and to a place he\u2019s not familiar with.  I mean *maybe* a hour or so during the party, after making sure he\u2019s doing ok and several of the parents have her number. But this sounds like a 12+ hour affair.  No. That\u2019s a bad choice you\u2019re saving the mom from making.", "NTA. Your claim is that caring for a low functioning autistic child is different from caring for neurotypical children. This is a pretty uncontroversial claim. You aren\u2019t willing / able to care for A for an overnight. That doesn\u2019t sound strange to me, particularly if A is a lot of work to care for and you lack any relevant training. A\u2019s mother\u2019s reaction is telling - the fact that she played the \u201csingle mother alone time\u201d card shows you how she looks at these overnight parties, and that she\u2019s more concerned with getting a night off than setting her son up for success in his social life.", "NTA. You aren't equipped to handle him without his mother present. That isn't unreasonable.", "NTA - you\u2019re both protecting your child\u2019s ability to enjoy party AND protecting A by telling their mom that you aren\u2019t comfortable being a caretaker for A.\n\nBoundaries are ok", "Holy crap, she's an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer child needs her there and she's refusing to do her job as his mother? bleugh.\n\nI have 2 kids on the spectrum and while one of them was fine being left at parties if i wanted to leave her there (i didn't always..  depended on the kid and parents in question),  the other definitely couldn't be left.\n\nI was always there to supervise and make sure he and others had fun -  that was literally my job as his parent.     I'd have felt awful if i'd done any differently and either him or his friends or parents had struggled because of it.\n\nYes it's difficult being a single parent -  but it's even more difficult being a child on the spectrum that can't navigate social situations or cope without supervision. \n\nIf she's struggling more than she can handle,  she needs to reach out for assistance to social services or somewhere..    not just dump her child on people that have no experience and could end in disaster.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and I feel bad for A, because he was born from an AH.\n\nI can understand a parent in her situation needing sympathy...but once she pulled that crap, let her deal with it on her own. Block her.", "NTA. She has some nerve.", "NTA.\n\nWhen she said that you don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time, she exposed her intentions to have you as baby sitter for a full 24 hours.\n\nI am very high functioning autistic and I'm a handful even in the burgeoning twilight of my life.  There are potential triggers there that even mom hasn't thought of since this is uncharted territory.  I feel as an autistic man who has more or less learned to cope that if mother cannot be there for a couple of hours for her own autistic child that it can be construed as abuse.  I certainly feel that way, because I have some idea of what can happen with an autistic child in unfamiliar surroundings, from both the child's side and the neurotypical adult's side.\n\nDo not back down under any circumstances.  The child is invited if she's present at all times.  An hour or two should be enough for him.  He will indicate when he is overwhelmed.  Since the neighbourhood knows what has happened it should be easy to have several adults chaperone the mother so that she does not skip out.  She does not get a free babysitter overnight.  If she introduces a babysitter at the ready in the event that he gets overwhelmed and wants to go home, then the problem can be considered solved and you've reached a win/win consensus.", "NTA. She's using this opportunity as a babysitter/free time for herself. At 8, I'd have never let my (autistic) son be left in that situation. She asked you answered honestly, and now she's pissed and petty that you're unwilling to care for her child for 12-18 hours.", "NTA. This poor kid\u2019s mother is a big A though for making it about her.", "Based on the information provided, it seems that you are NTA for not feeling comfortable with having A attend the party without adult supervision. It's understandable that you don't have experience with autistic children and that you're concerned about not being able to properly care for him amidst the other activities and guests.\n\nIt's unfortunate that A's mother is upset and spreading false information about the situation. You did not uninvite A because of his autism, but rather expressed concern about being able to provide proper care for him. It's also understandable that A's mother would want some alone time, but that doesn't mean that it's appropriate to leave her child in a situation where he may become overwhelmed and require additional attention.\n\nIt's good that the parents who are staying have offered to help with A, but it may be worth reaching out to A's mother to explain your concerns and see if there is a compromise that can be reached. Perhaps she can arrange for someone else to supervise A or provide additional support. Ultimately, the most important thing is ensuring that A is safe and comfortable at the party.", "NTA. I feel for her, but your concerns are completely valid. I don't think I'd be comfortable with it either, unless he was the child of a close friend. And I'm amazed the mom is so eager to leave him with a stranger. I get needing a break, but he's still her baby. I don't think I could have done that. I'd tell her you're sorry but he can't sleep over, he's still welcome to come to the party before the sleepover.", "NTA. The mother is wanting a break if he's low functioning. Based on her reaction. But it's not right to dump him on someone that hasn't delt with him at a birthday party. Maybe a couple play dates in the future and try again. Glad you raised your daughter not to judge.", "NTA. Of course it's difficult for her, but you have to think of what's best for this child.  It wouldn't do him any favors to put him in an uncomfortable situation without someone able to help him properly.", "NTA. Her being a single mother doesn\u2019t mean jack in this situation. You\u2019re watching THIRTY other kids. If the autistic kid has a melt down she\u2019d be throwing you under the bus for not watching them enough. And I say this as a borderline autistic person", "I have an Autistic son. He's not super low functioning, but he's not high functioning either.  And the only place he can spend the night is my mother's house.  And sometimes he still needs to come home.  Out in public, I can give some space, but if he needs me, he always knows where to find me. And he sounds better off than this kid. Nta", "NTA.\n\nI would never dream of doing such a thing with my ASD child.\n\nThe mum knows this is hard, and is a major AH for expecting someone with no experience who is also hosting a load of other kids, to be able to do what is needed to keep her kid safe in every aspect of the term.\n\nIf feeling bad you could offer to have kid over for a playdate another time - but tell her that in this instance the sleepover isn't happening and she can not leave her kid there without adequate provision for their needs. Any other parent that has an issue can be asked if they are willing to step up and take on the responsibility.", "Info:\n\nHow much do you know about A's condition? You say that you believe he is low-functioning, but that doesn't have a real meaning in regards to how well he can handle a sleep over. If you have been around A enough to know you cannot handle him, then N  t a. However, if you really don't know much about A, you should have asked for more information before making a decision. I don't think it makes you TA that you didn't, but it would've been better if you had. \n\nIt looks like your fears were confirmed after the fact by another parent. But in the future I would try to get more information before making a decision, as autism and other conditions have such a wide range of presentation that you can't really make a judgement based on the diagnosis alone.", "INFO - your child asked for A to be invited, right?\nYou knew A is autistic before you invited them, right?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you did the responsible thing.", "NTA\n\nsounds like this child\u2019s mother just invited him to a sleepover that he was never invited to to begin with. That\u2019s pretty rude and entitled. As a child who regularly had a big party and then five or six close friends stay over, I wouldn\u2019t be happy that someone is inviting themselves over to my sleepovers.

Watching anyone else\u2019s child is a huge liability. And the reality is is that because of her child special-needs he\u2019s more likely to get hurt under your care. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know his special requirements.

It would be infinitely worse if something happened to A or one of the other children. \n\nThe reason A is not able to attend the party has nothing to do with you and is solely because his mother will not provide support for him, whether that is her or another adult he trusts. Seems to me that this is just free babysitting to her.\n\nShe is an A H for badmouthing you about this and I hope everyone sees through it, which they likely will if she has a history of this behaviour.

You want time, get respite care! You do not leave your child that has difficulties in a situation that can easily be over stimulated and blame others for not being OK with it. While I don't exactly like that it's classed as a disability, it is. Both asd and adhd not to mention the rest. \n\nJust tell others. He IS invited, but she wants to dump and run and I'm not ok with that. \nShe is his parent not u and she needs to be there with him. It's not an offer of childcare, it's a party. He has special needs which she understands and can meet where as u, or the other parents, cannot necessarily meet.. Especially if there's a meltdown. They can be quite difficult to handle. If something were to happen, she's going to blame u when she's the one who wants to dump and run on her kid! NTA", "NTA. Taking care of an autistic child is a huge responsibility. I work with autistic kids one on one, and even then they have me running loops on some days (I wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world though, I care so much about those kids). I applaud you for realizing that it is something not within your skill set and vocalizing that to the mother. Because if something happens to her child, then she\u2019ll blame you. If she was willing to stay and watch her kiddo for the party, then I think that could work. But if she just wants to leave him with you, while you are watching 30 other kids, and while you are focusing on YOUR daughters birthday, she\u2019s completely irresponsible. It\u2019s insane to me that she thinks that\u2019s going to end well.", "INFO: what do you know about A to determine that he\u2019s low functioning?", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA\u2026.which parents are causing shade?   Tell them, the child was not uninvited, but you told mom, since you do not have experience with autistic children and you will otherwise be overseeing the party, you told the mom she could not just drop off her child, but must stay and supervise her child.  If they feel this is so wrong, I will be sure to give mom your name and number and you can discuss supervising her child at the party.  I can see the back peddling now.", "NTA.", "NTA, you have zero experience with autistic children; especially a low functioning one, and you\u2019ll be extremely busy running the party and keeping track of the other children, mostly *alone* as your a single parent, to give special care and attention that \u201cA\u201d will need. Sounds like a recipe for disaster. I think it\u2019s nice he was invited at all since most children who\u2019re different are left out by their peers. You\u2019re raising your daughter right by including him without you having to ask or guide her! Good job and don\u2019t feel guilty.", "NTA. You said it well\u2026.you don\u2019t have experience and she needs to stay. I have an autistic child and wouldn\u2019t never think to dump him off on a classmates parent.", "NTA. Can this child swim on their own? That\u2019s the more concerning problem since a pool party with 30 kids regardless of how many parents stay to help out will be hard. It\u2019ll be even harder if a child autistic or not is unable to swim in general.", "Seems like A's mother doesn't care for her son's comfort, just for her own to be rid of him for a day. NTA. Kids with autism can all behave very differently and have very specific needs - I know because I used to be one. Okay, my Asperger's never left me, but I'm no longer a kid, so there.\n\nMy point is, I can totally understand if you feel yourself to be ill equipped to handle such a kid. And therefore you're not the Arsehole. Your hesitations are only in his best interests.", "NTA. I find it very annoying that she has said that her kid doesn't get invited to things. Her kid WAS invited. This was an oppurtunity to let her kid have fun, she could have met some other parents. Maybe in time the kid might make friends and if the mother had actually made effort to get to know anyone, everyone could learn more about how best to accomadate the kid. Everything OP said implied to me openess and willingness to learn, it's ok to admit he's not comfortable and lacks experience!  It's got to be hard for kids with difficulties and their parents too, but this is sheer lazy selfishness on the mum's part. Truly cutting off her nose to spite her face. The audacity to say as a single mom to a single dad who's organising a party with so much going on. You're smashing it btw OP, it's sad about the kid but don't think there's much to do about the moms bullshit.", "NTA, his mom sounds horrible lol \nYou said it was okay to invite him, it's a normal petition for his mom to stay there too, specially if his low functioning \n\nAlso, you didn't uninvited did you? The mom telling a lie it's so childish smh\n\nYou can still invite him but not at the sleep over and the mom has to be there, I'm 100% sure that if you said he can stay at the party but not the sleepover his mom would ditch him there, poor thing \n\nBut it's not your kid, she sounds like just want a free nanny", "You really should check with the mother before reaching these decisions/conclusions. Your 'understanding' is that he is 'low functioning', what does that mean to you and why is that your understanding? It's no longer used so where did you hear it? does he need specialist care? Does he have meltdown and/or shutdowns? You're only guessing that he does, my children don't. So I'm going against popular opinion here, YTA.", "YTA, to begin with, before having so many children, who are so young, to an event that goes on and on and on through the night, you should have paid assistants for every event and maybe an overall coordinator.\n\nI think you asked your daughter what she wanted to do and you just went ahead and signed up for everything. Y'know, one of a parent's jobs is saying \"Enough.\" Your event sounds like a horror show to me! Dealing with the single mother of an autistic child is the least of if your worries right now.", "Yeah, maybe talk to A\u2019s mom and offer as a compromise that if she stays to supervise at the party, you\u2019d be happy to have A over unsupervised when it\u2019s a quiet evening, one-on-one, and you\u2019d appreciate her advice on how to make it stress free for A.\n\nBut only if you can handle it, it\u2019s fine if you can\u2019t.", "Autistic mum of autistic kids here and I'm going with ESH.\n\nBased on the info given, OP jumped to the conclusion this child will be too much to handle. Now, maybe OP knows this kid well enough to know they're 100% too much to handle and if so, well and good, but that's not the impression I got.\n\nMy kids are autistic. They can handle parties just fine. Sleepovers too. If someone decided they couldn't, and singled them out of 30 other kids based on assumptions, I'd be pretty ticked. Yes, my son has had meltdowns at school. Yes, my daughter had a period of extreme separation anxiety. Both had med adjustments and those issues are no longer happening.\n\nOP: next time, would you consider seeking more info before making your decision? Questions like \"what accommodations does X need\" and \"has X had a sleepover before\" and \"I know X has had meltdowns in class, what's the best way to deal with that?\". \n\nMaybe the answer is \"X will require accommodations A, B and C.\" Or it might be \"X will probably be fine, they've had a few sleepovers/parties without issue. I'll send their noise cancelling headphones and favourite stuffie, here is my number if there are any issues. The last meltdown X had was 9 months ago and was caused by predictable triggers that won't occur in this situation and also had had a med change which has really helped their regulation. X knows if they're getting overstimulated and will just ask for a quiet spot to sit in for fifteen minutes if that happens.\"\n\nYou're 100% within your rights to say no, I can't accommodate that/I can accommodate that but only until 10pm and not for a sleepover/I can accommodate that but I'll need you to stay and help. But some autistic kids can handle themselves just fine at a sleepover. Just like some non-autistic kids can get homesick or on a sugar high or have nightmares away from home, and some are fine. \n\nThe comment about needing a babysitter was a dick move though.", "Good point. I didn't even catch that!", "seriously. i'm so confused why it took me so long to see a comment saying this. yes they're young, but that's too old for sleepovers with boys and girls together.", ">A's mother got really upset with me, telling me I don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time\n\nBut she actually admitted this.", "She literally said \u201chow hard it is for single moms to get alone time.\u201d Other parents are staying for the party with their children so it\u2019s not like he would be singled out for her to stay. So yeah it does to me sound like she\u2019s mostly looking for babysitting rather than looking out for her kid", "Exactly. I have a kid who\u2019s neurodivergent and as a parent you just suck it up and stay at events like this so it will be a positive experience for everyone. You don\u2019t ditch them because \u201ceveryone else can\u201d. My younger kid had an autistic classmate at his birthday party earlier this month and the mom stayed even though no one else did. Like you do.", "So if you think its inappropriate, why are you still demanding that the op is an asshole for saying no?", ">OP even states he doesn't know the extent of his diagnosis, or how he responds to situations. He's guessing on how the child behaves and would react. \n\nAre you suggesting that OP should take a risk during his kids birthday party to see if he can handle the kid? Its unfair to ask a parent to take care of your neurodivergent child when they do not know them during a big event.", "Totally agree. I\u2019m also surprised why no one mentioned this in prior comments. That should have/could have shut down the sleepover request from the boy\u2019s mom immediately. I mean it\u2019s so weird that the mom asked/expected for her SON to attend a sleepover for the 9 year old birthday GIRL.", "She said it to a single dad as well...", "Ummm, 9 is when puberty starts for many, and kids are so over seucalized these days many are watching porn by 10.
