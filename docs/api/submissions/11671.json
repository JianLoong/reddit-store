Hopefully everyone can help.\n\nI, 37M, am a single father to my daughter, 8, who will be turning nine this Saturday. I'll call her G. G decided she wanted pool party birthday party at our house. I plan on doing other activities as well, such as bounce houses,cookout, s'mores, movie by the pool, make your own cookies, etc., followed by a sleepover with some of her friends. It's gonna be a busy day, and there'll be roughly 30 kids at my house. Some parents are staying, and some are just dropping off their kids and picking them up later. I'm fine with this.\n\nI let G invited whoever she wanted, and she chose to invite a classmate, A, that is autistic. I was fine with this, as I've always taught G not to judge others based on their differences. \n\nHere is where my dilemma comes into play. A's mother called me last week to ask if it would okay just to drop off him and pick him up the next day so he could attend the sleepover. My problem is I have no experience with an autistic child, and my understanding is A is very low functioning. I guess he's prone to getting easily overwhelmed and will start to shutdown/outburst. \n\nI told A's mom that I wouldn't be comfortable with him being there by himself as I would be too busy with everything else going on and am inexperienced with autistic children. A's mother got really upset with me, telling me I don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time, and how A would be devastated that he wouldn't be able to attend and how happy he was to attend a party, since he rarely gets invited to things., among other things. \n\nA's mom is now going around saying I \"uninvited \" her son because of his autism, causing parents to throw shade at me. The parents that are staying offered to help with A, but they also have little to no experience with autistic children either.

Autistic mom of someone on the spectrum, here. She wants a free babysitter. Shame on her for even attempting this. Folks on the spectrum are often traumatized by untrained supervision/a lack of supervision. If she needs a night off, she can seek out the many services provided for Autistic folk or talk to her own family/friends.", "NTA, a reasonable compromise would be having A attend a few parts of the party and then leave prior to the sleepover. You aren't excluding or uninviting him, just recognizing you're not equipped to provide enough support. Especially since you'll have 29 other young children to watch! Seems like A's mom is just looking for a free night.", "NTA. As a single mom of an autistic child who hasn\u2019t had a break in a month, I would never consider leaving him at a birthday party for people he\u2019s not familiar with to take care of him. A\u2019s mother is an ass\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have to miss out\u2026 she can bring him and stay to take care of him.", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to turn you into respite care, and that\u2019s going to be a bad time for all involved.", "NTA it\u2019s the day of YOUR child\u2019s birthday, you will be entertaining and being pulled in so many directions. I personally would not feel comfortable either. Maybe they can get together for a sleep over when it\u2019s not as much going on?", "NTA and honestly, I question the judgement of the mother, who would send her autistic child to an overnight with people she doesn\u2019t know and to a place he\u2019s not familiar with.  I mean *maybe* a hour or so during the party, after making sure he\u2019s doing ok and several of the parents have her number. But this sounds like a 12+ hour affair.  No. That\u2019s a bad choice you\u2019re saving the mom from making.", "NTA. Your claim is that caring for a low functioning autistic child is different from caring for neurotypical children. This is a pretty uncontroversial claim. You aren\u2019t willing / able to care for A for an overnight. That doesn\u2019t sound strange to me, particularly if A is a lot of work to care for and you lack any relevant training. A\u2019s mother\u2019s reaction is telling - the fact that she played the \u201csingle mother alone time\u201d card shows you how she looks at these overnight parties, and that she\u2019s more concerned with getting a night off than setting her son up for success in his social life.", "NTA. You aren't equipped to handle him without his mother present. That isn't unreasonable.", "NTA - you\u2019re both protecting your child\u2019s ability to enjoy party AND protecting A by telling their mom that you aren\u2019t comfortable being a caretaker for A.\n\nBoundaries are ok", "Holy crap, she's an asshole.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHer child needs her there and she's refusing to do her job as his mother? bleugh.\n\nI have 2 kids on the spectrum and while one of them was fine being left at parties if i wanted to leave her there (i didn't always..  depended on the kid and parents in question),  the other definitely couldn't be left.\n\nI was always there to supervise and make sure he and others had fun -  that was literally my job as his parent.     I'd have felt awful if i'd done any differently and either him or his friends or parents had struggled because of it.\n\nYes it's difficult being a single parent -  but it's even more difficult being a child on the spectrum that can't navigate social situations or cope without supervision. \n\nIf she's struggling more than she can handle,  she needs to reach out for assistance to social services or somewhere..    not just dump her child on people that have no experience and could end in disaster.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and I feel bad for A, because he was born from an AH.\n\nI can understand a parent in her situation needing sympathy...but once she pulled that crap, let her deal with it on her own. Block her.", "NTA. She has some nerve.", "NTA.\n\nWhen she said that you don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time, she exposed her intentions to have you as baby sitter for a full 24 hours.\n\nI am very high functioning autistic and I'm a handful even in the burgeoning twilight of my life.  There are potential triggers there that even mom hasn't thought of since this is uncharted territory.  I feel as an autistic man who has more or less learned to cope that if mother cannot be there for a couple of hours for her own autistic child that it can be construed as abuse.  I certainly feel that way, because I have some idea of what can happen with an autistic child in unfamiliar surroundings, from both the child's side and the neurotypical adult's side.\n\nDo not back down under any circumstances.  The child is invited if she's present at all times.  An hour or two should be enough for him.  He will indicate when he is overwhelmed.  Since the neighbourhood knows what has happened it should be easy to have several adults chaperone the mother so that she does not skip out.  She does not get a free babysitter overnight.  If she introduces a babysitter at the ready in the event that he gets overwhelmed and wants to go home, then the problem can be considered solved and you've reached a win/win consensus.", "NTA. She's using this opportunity as a babysitter/free time for herself. At 8, I'd have never let my (autistic) son be left in that situation. She asked you answered honestly, and now she's pissed and petty that you're unwilling to care for her child for 12-18 hours.", "NTA. This poor kid\u2019s mother is a big A though for making it about her.", "Based on the information provided, it seems that you are NTA for not feeling comfortable with having A attend the party without adult supervision. It's understandable that you don't have experience with autistic children and that you're concerned about not being able to properly care for him amidst the other activities and guests.\n\nIt's unfortunate that A's mother is upset and spreading false information about the situation. You did not uninvite A because of his autism, but rather expressed concern about being able to provide proper care for him. It's also understandable that A's mother would want some alone time, but that doesn't mean that it's appropriate to leave her child in a situation where he may become overwhelmed and require additional attention.\n\nIt's good that the parents who are staying have offered to help with A, but it may be worth reaching out to A's mother to explain your concerns and see if there is a compromise that can be reached. Perhaps she can arrange for someone else to supervise A or provide additional support. Ultimately, the most important thing is ensuring that A is safe and comfortable at the party.", "NTA. I feel for her, but your concerns are completely valid. I don't think I'd be comfortable with it either, unless he was the child of a close friend. And I'm amazed the mom is so eager to leave him with a stranger. I get needing a break, but he's still her baby. I don't think I could have done that. I'd tell her you're sorry but he can't sleep over, he's still welcome to come to the party before the sleepover.", "NTA. The mother is wanting a break if he's low functioning. Based on her reaction. But it's not right to dump him on someone that hasn't delt with him at a birthday party. Maybe a couple play dates in the future and try again. Glad you raised your daughter not to judge.", "NTA. Of course it's difficult for her, but you have to think of what's best for this child.  It wouldn't do him any favors to put him in an uncomfortable situation without someone able to help him properly.", "NTA. Her being a single mother doesn\u2019t mean jack in this situation. You\u2019re watching THIRTY other kids. If the autistic kid has a melt down she\u2019d be throwing you under the bus for not watching them enough. And I say this as a borderline autistic person", "I have an Autistic son. He's not super low functioning, but he's not high functioning either.  And the only place he can spend the night is my mother's house.  And sometimes he still needs to come home.  Out in public, I can give some space, but if he needs me, he always knows where to find me. And he sounds better off than this kid. Nta", "NTA.\n\nI would never dream of doing such a thing with my ASD child.\n\nThe mum knows this is hard, and is a major AH for expecting someone with no experience who is also hosting a load of other kids, to be able to do what is needed to keep her kid safe in every aspect of the term.\n\nIf feeling bad you could offer to have kid over for a playdate another time - but tell her that in this instance the sleepover isn't happening and she can not leave her kid there without adequate provision for their needs. Any other parent that has an issue can be asked if they are willing to step up and take on the responsibility.", "Info:\n\nHow much do you know about A's condition? You say that you believe he is low-functioning, but that doesn't have a real meaning in regards to how well he can handle a sleep over. If you have been around A enough to know you cannot handle him, then N  t a. However, if you really don't know much about A, you should have asked for more information before making a decision. I don't think it makes you TA that you didn't, but it would've been better if you had. \n\nIt looks like your fears were confirmed after the fact by another parent. But in the future I would try to get more information before making a decision, as autism and other conditions have such a wide range of presentation that you can't really make a judgement based on the diagnosis alone.", "INFO - your child asked for A to be invited, right?\nYou knew A is autistic before you invited them, right?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No, NTA. I\u2019m sure mom is worn out, but it does not save her from AH status. That is some over-the-top entitlement. Not to mention the lack of judgement. She doesn\u2019t know you, but she\u2019ll drop her kid off to be watched by you? Scary. Good for you for not falling prey. Emphatically NTA.", "NTA! If you have no experience with autistic children, she has no right to expect you to assume the responsibility and liability for her child for an overnight stay. Especially around a pool!  You didn\u2019t even uninvite the child, you just refused to allow her to drop her son off unsupervised. I think you did the responsible thing.", "NTA\n\nsounds like this child\u2019s mother just invited him to a sleepover that he was never invited to to begin with. That\u2019s pretty rude and entitled. As a child who regularly had a big party and then five or six close friends stay over, I wouldn\u2019t be happy that someone is inviting themselves over to my sleepovers. There are friends that you like to play with, but they\u2019re not necessarily the friends you want to go into your room touching your toys and your special things.\n\nShe\u2019s going to get the day to herself. Now she\u2019s just being greedy. For all the parents, who are throwing shade at you, really challenge them to consider what happened. Because I don\u2019t think any of them would be happy if it were them in this position.\n\nAnd I think ultimately, she\u2019s not seeing the bigger picture. Watching anyone else\u2019s child is a huge liability. And the reality is is that because of her child special-needs he\u2019s more likely to get hurt under your care. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know his special requirements. If she really needs time alone, then maybe she should save up for a babysitter who can specialize in this so she can have a day to herself.", "Ehhh I wouldn't trust the mom to not just drop off her kid and not come back till morning. And if cops were called mom would play dumb and be like I thought it was a sleepover party.", "Seconding\u2014how could a parent do this to their kid? The poor child will be so dysregulated in not only a totally unfamiliar environment, but also all the extra sensory stimulation of a birthday party, *and* a sleepover? This is going to be so stressful for this kid. OP is NTA.", "NTA. A\u2019s mother said it. It was more important for her to get alone time. Her priority should be providing A with support so he still got to enjoy activities with his friends while providing a safety net if things go pear shaped - a highly like scenario in something as chaotic as a kids party. In A\u2019s mother\u2019s position I would be overjoyed that my son wouldn\u2019t be excluded and do everything in my power to make it as stress free for the hosts as possible so we got a repeat invitation.", ">One parent on my side A's mother did this to her at her son's party, and he definitely is a handful, so not to feel bad.\n\n>A's mother got really upset with me, telling me I don't understand how hard it is for single moms to get alone time\n\nShe's pulled this before and it didn't go well. You are also a single parent and will have 30 kids, near a pool, and other activities and some adults that aren't his adult. This lady is NOT your friend, you are not responsible for her getting alone time. \n\nHer kid wants to attend the part, great, she stays and takes him home. She doesn't drop him off and flee. NTA. She's doing a disservice to her child and you.", "NTA\n\nYou have recognized that your own inexperience, limitations and being busy could put A\u2019s safety and that of the other children at risk. This is responsible, reasonable and considerate behaviour. It would be infinitely worse if something happened to A or one of the other children. \n\nThe reason A is not able to attend the party has nothing to do with you and is solely because his mother will not provide support for him, whether that is her or another adult he trusts. Seems to me that this is just free babysitting to her.\n\nShe is an A H for badmouthing you about this and I hope everyone sees through it, which they likely will if she has a history of this behaviour. She\u2019s a double A H because she cares more about her social life than her son\u2019s welfare.", "Not saying that it's a good idea for the kid to stay for the sleepover, but saying she wants a free babysitter and should be ashamed might be jumping to conclusions. \nMaybe she just desperately wishes her kid could have a \"normal\" childhood experience like all the other kids. As a mom with a child on the spectrum it's kinda heartbreaking knowing he's missing out and maybe she's just reacting poorly to the reality of the situation.", "Not knowing much about a kid is a very good reason to decline babysitting them for 12 hours.", "That was answered in the post.", "Is it so out of the blue an autistic child might want to see/experience a bd party? I think dropping him off for a few hours to see how it goes is a good compromise. If it doesn't work out, pick them up. If they say they don't want to go that's ok. If they want to try then don't make them.", "I think the comment she made about it being hard \"for single moms to get alone time\" kind of tipped off her desire for a free babysitter.", "Well if she wanted her child to have a \u201cnormal\u201d experience, she could\u2019ve offered to stay as parents of other \u201cnormal\u201d children were staying.
