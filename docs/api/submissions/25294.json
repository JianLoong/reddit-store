Even now, he goes to bed at the same time as his younger brother (8.30 weekdays, 9pm weekends and hols) but stays awake reading until well after I'm asleep. He's still the first one up. I think he probably averages 6 hrs a night and it was probably much less when he was a toddler because he was also up during the night then.

Only because the daughter is 3 and nights as a single parent are rough. The local night time daycares around here keep kids up to keep them on the parents schedule until their school aged. They then either drop the kids because they're 0-5 putting parents in two binds (transitioning the kids to a day shift routine AND who's watching the kid at night) or if they're available for 0-12 they transition the kid to sleeping at night around kindergarten. Places like that typically offer Pre-K and the work sponsored one has flood lights on the playground. So kids still do stuff. But it's still hard on everyone. But allowing your toddler to stay up until 3 am because \"we like staying up late\" seems super detrimental to the kid for no reason at all. Like I'm married and was facing this when my husband's job wanted to force him to nights too. It took a lot of thought because if our toddler wasn't on our schedule we'd never get to spend time with her and sleep.
