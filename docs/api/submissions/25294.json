In different countries and cultures, \"bedtimes\" are different. \n\nMost Mediterranean countries for example have a later bedtime, including for children, than Northern Europe. And US or Australia both have very very early bedtimes even for adults. \n\nMaybe we need to know if there is a culture clash here?", "context is important. OP asked for a boundary (put child to bed by midnight bc op is tired) and she basically said \u201cbecause you asked that, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be together\u201d \n\nSuggesting someone shouldn\u2019t be with you because they asked you to put your child (who keeps them up) to bed by midnight is definitely manipulative \n\nTelling a friend they shouldn\u2019t date someone with a child bc they\u2019re easily woken by kids could just be advice, tho", "Oh wow.\n\nWell I was only around until this one was 8. For all I know she might be doing the same thing now. Lol", "It\u2019s just inconsiderate, period. I\u2019m visiting friends in a week, and am grateful I can spare room hop during this time.", "100% my oldest fought early bed times for so long, and it was such a battle so i thought it wasnt super important, but now he's in a great routine and he's so much better behaviourally and functionally getting good rest", "I\u2019m 40 and that\u2019s super late even for me to go to bed", "I let my 3 year old go to bed whenever.  I'm up late into the night and my wife is up early in the mornings so someone was already around.  If she wanted to sleep 7-11pm and then stay up half the night I didn't see any issue.  \n\nWhen it came time for kindergarden she slid right into a school schedule with no issues.", "I feel so bad for the teachers who have to deal with that poor child!", "Science isn't cultural.", "I am from a Southern European country living in Australia since I was a kid, and also lived for a year in Spain  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe kid should be in bed by 7/8. The kids in spain are always tired - they go to bed way too late and have to be up super early for \"pre\" school care or daycare (a positive is that this is covered by the government). Many get siestas but others don't as some parents overload them with extracurriculars from a young age and throughout school.  \n\n\nIt is scientifc. I say this as someone with a scientifically crazy sleep cycle - my best sleep time is 4:00am - 11:00am, I have done sleep studies due to my \"insomnia\".  Even if these cycles applied to kids, it would be dependant on not waking them early for daycare/school/etc which is rarely the case   \n\n\n(but if it is the case here I covered that by saying in the rare case that the kid is able to sleep with the mother til 11am or something which OP does not mention here)", "I'm not sure. I think it's not manipulative to just make clear that if you aren't okay with the kid, you should break up. Surely that's quite straightforward?", "I'm 30 and that's late for me too.. unless I'm out seeing friends, I'm in my bed by 23h30", "What's scientific about it? The science also says that humans have a variety of optimal sleep cycles; some are more morning people or night time people. I'm a morning person, hence why I'm up at 5:30 to write this. Younger people need more sleep but still have their own rhythms that make most sense. Plus as I said some cultures lean towards different schedules. \n\nMy question is just if OP's partner has a schedule or reason for not fitting to his idea of sleep patterns. It could just be different.", "Having worked in daycare in Spain, I disagree. Most of those kids were up late and were fine. A siesta was normal. This also is a sleep schedule that works well for me as an adult. \n\nI do think the opinion given above is narrow and not always applicable. The OP doesn't say where they are. \n\nI also find it insane how early my US and Aus friends go to bed as adults. But that's their own choice. For a kid, it may be harder as they are being sent to bed even if they have no sleep cues yet.", "What\u2019s scientific about it?\n\nThe fact that children need a certain amount of deep sleep *in order to grow and develop properly.*", "The kids i taught in spain were always sleepy af and so were the little kids in my little urbanization I lived in. This was north though so I feel less siesta enforcment than down south where it;s hotter  \n\n\nYeah  my friends in Aus def go to bed pretty early, like 10 to max midnight. I tend to go around 3 -4am which is abnormal cause I need to be up at 7 but I just cant sleep, I try to do a nap in the arvo haha", ">The fact that children need a certain amount of deep sleep in order to grow and develop properly.\n\nSure, but prove it has to be at 19:00.\n\nIt doesn't. I'm not arguing against adequate sleep, just pointing out it doesn't have to be at the exact time your own culture dictates.", "I'm Irish and I'm an early bird so I go to bed at like 22:00/23:00. I also love a siesta. I've only been to Aus a couple of times but my friends there defs had an earlier bedtime than me! \n\nNo offense meant but you have to know it's more normalised that little kids stay up later in some countries/cultures than others, which is all I was really calling out. If it's healthy or not depends just on how much total sleep they get not what hours it is.", "normalised is different to what they should do though for their health and wellness - again I am from a southern euro country (Balkans) and the kids bedtimes are like holy scripture there for most people during the week. It's because it's SO important for their health and development.  \n\n\nAnd also OP is in the US I think  \n\n\nI do know some Aussies that go to bed at like 9pm and wake up at 4am though - I broke up with one guy because of his bedtime. He was surprised but I was like how can we have a joint life on weekdays? haha", "I don't necessarily disagree - but what's best for me isn't necessarily best for everyone or should be normalised across everyone in the world either. That's what I'm pointing out. Not everyone has the same routine and if it works well for you, as long as you're still getting your eight hours, why care. Kids need a bit more so make sure they get that."]}
