Anyway, my vote is NTA as long as you accept that your girlfriend will stay in another room with her daughter.", "Lol my 3 year old is asleep by 8:30. She\u2019s up at 7:30. Kids need a lot of sleep. How long does she sleep in till? NTA", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t have kids, but I have a niece and nephew. At 3 years old, bath time is at 7 and bed by 7:30. Kids NEED their sleep, and they need a set routine. \n\nBut beyond that - it\u2019s wild that she thinks being a parent or being with someone with a kid means you have to have the kid in the same room while you\u2019re trying to sleep. \n\nAt 3, most of my friend\u2019s kids had their own rooms (or shared with a sibling). And if they\u2019re wide awake at night, one parent takes them into another room\u2026 not the same room as the parent who needs to rest. \n\nThis is bonkers and I think it\u2019s a big red flag on so many levels. Just the fact that she has a 3 year old up past like\u2026 8-9 pm is a red flag. It says things about how much research she\u2019s done into what a kid needs, her own self discipline, boundaries, her ability to set aside time to be an adult versus being on child duty 24/7\u2026 prioritizing issues\u2026 idk what else. Add to that how aggressive she got over it? \n\nNo\u2026 that would be a nope for me.", "NTA\n\nMy god. That is such a ridiculous bedtime for a 3 year old. 2am??\n\nDoes your gf not work? What kind of sleep schedule is she on, because I know damn well that kid ain't sleeping in till noon.", "NTA, 3 year olds should have a better sleep schedule, and if they don\u2019t, she needs to accomodate that, not you. It\u2019s her responsibility.\n\nThe comment about not being with someone with a kid is gross, you seem like you\u2019d be fine with someone with a kid, just not *that* someone with a kid", "NTA\u2026 now RUN!!!!", "She\u2019s right. You aren\u2019t meant to be with HER and her kid. Children need bedtimes and midnight is too late to be up. Two am is abuse. By the time her daughter is in school and has to be there in the morning, she won\u2019t know how to go to sleep to get enough rest. \n\nThis is not the relationship for you, and it\u2019s good that you learned this now before they moved in permanently. She\u2019s given you an out so take it.", "NTA. Not wanting to be disturbed at midnight because you have work in the morning is reasonable for any reason.", "NTA. That poor child. \ud83d\ude2d", "I don\u2019t know anyone with a kid that age who puts them to bed later than 7:30 PM. WTF???? You are NTA I\u2019d be questioning her choices and frankly the relationship.", "Run Forest, RUN!", "Maybe she doesn\u2019t care about the growth of her child and their future. That\u2019s effing crazy. Like what the heck just to let you know not all single moms are like that..", "I have an almost 3 yr old. She\u2019s generally in bed by 7:30pm. I cannot imagine her staying up until 2am. Wtf. That\u2019s so late.", "NTA that 3 yr old should be in bed sleeping around 9.", "NTA\n\nShe's gonna raise her kid her way. I won't say she is wrong, but I never let my toddlers stay up past 8. After 8 was adult time. Sit down and talk to her. It may end up that you two just aren't compatible, and that is ok too.", "NTA-My mom was pretty chill and I never had a bedtime but usually I sleep when I\u2019m tired or I sleep by 9 or 10pm and sometimes I might stay up later if we are both watching a tv show at the time (it was back in the 2000\u2019s so Netflix didn\u2019t exist) if it\u2019s weekends then I can stay up late as long as I can.", "This!  No 3 year old should be up into the wee hours of the night.  Children need structure and schedules.  They are guests in your home and your girlfriend should be open to you asking her to put her child to bed by midnight and being more considerate. She has no respect for you. Is this the type of relationship you want to be in? NTA.", "She already is. \u201eMaybe you\u2019re just not meant to be w someone with a child\u201c. If this isn\u2019t unbelievably manipulative, I don\u2019t know what is.", "I feel like I've already lived OP's life.\n\nJust wait until the kid is a little older and wants to sleep in their room every single night until she's 8 because her mom won't say no or actually do any parenting so she's still afraid of sleeping in her own bed. This is exactly where this late night thing is going.", "Okay but there is still no reason her 3 year old child is up until 2 am. I\u2019m saying this as a mother, him asking her to put her to bed at Midnight is not pushing. It\u2019s asking for some sort of light structure (for himself and the child). Her being unwilling to meet him there says 3 things about her 1) she is an unfit mother who sees the child as her best friend more than\u2026 HER CHILD. (Cuz truly, what are you doing with a 3 year old at 2am???)  2) she has no respect for the man who is letting her and her child stay with him. And 3) she feels all of her time should be occupied with the child and she and OP doesn\u2019t need \u2018adult time\u2019 to himself. Nothing wrong with loving your child but to spend from whatever time they wake up to 2am with them every second of the day is absolutely insane. And to basically demand OP to do the same (when he\u2019s never had a child of his own so he may not have the tolerance to have someone in his face all the time) is ludicrous and unfair. NTA", "Yeah, \"my 3-year-old and I stay up until 2am every night\" isn't even a controversial parenting fail.", "My younger cousins weren't ever really given a sleep schedule or \"bedtime\" now they are 9 and 10 and both of them stay awake until early morning. Kids need bedtimes.", "My kids were in bed at a certain hour every night. \n7:00 pm lights out till 7:00 am till they were 6years old. Max growth occurs at night , they need the rest.\n10 -12 hours from 7 years up to 14 years\n8-10 hours in high school. \nChildren need the sleep. Your GF is not a good mom. \nBut since it\u2019s not your child you cannot say anything except that she can sleep in the skate bedroom with her daughter and you need to let go of this relationship.\nYou definitely do not want to procreate with this woman .", "They are both sleeping half the day. There is no way a 3 year old stays up that late without a major nap.", "boundary aside, a kid that age should be in bed by 7pm or 8pm latest, unless your gf doesn't work and they both sleep in to like 11am or something which is a very uncommon arrangement some people who don't work make.", "Just think about how this kind of behavior plays out in the future in your relationship and your relationship with the kid.", " 2am for a 3yo is not a sleep schedule, it's the absence of a sleep schedule, and that can lead to many difficulties for her child in the future. She seems to need help and guidance to adress that, that doesn't make her a bad person, but her reaction to a legitimate demand from her BF doesn't show much understanding of the situation. So boyfriend on his own cannot be the one to help. It needs to come from someplace else. Where ? Professional help exist for this kind of situation, and in my country one of the way to get it for free is to contact children's protection. That is not a punishment, that's just looking out for the kid and helping a parent, and I understand it's not how it works in the US but as far as I remember OP doesn't say where he lives, so it might be something to consider (or at least getting outside help is, which is what I was actually trying to suggest). It could also be through books, podcasts... I don't have relevant ressources to offer spontaneously, maybe someone does.", "My parents never gave us schedules and would keep us up past 10pm to run errands or if we were already out somewhere and they wanted to continue to party.   \n\nGuess what?    We both have disrupted sleep cycles, insomnia, depression, and can\u2019t regulate our own sleep well at all.    This is decades later.   \n\nI\u2019m a mom now and there\u2019s so much research out about how kids need ample sleep to be well behaved / happy / develop properly.    \n\nOn low sleep they can\u2019t self regulate.   \n\nI\u2019m horrified on behalf of this 3yr old child.", "I believe that.  Getting kids in a routine is hard at first but the benefits are huge.  I have 3 kids, one of them was a night owl and it took a while (months) for my husband and I to get him into a sleep routine.  I\u2019m positive that if we left it up to him he\u2019d be up all night still.", "She could also work second shift or something, where this is the easiest way she actually gets to spend time with her daughter", "yeah i said unless they sleep in but it is unlikely given he didnt mention it. But it can be a thing, nonetheless why is the kid in their shared room until 2am?"]}
