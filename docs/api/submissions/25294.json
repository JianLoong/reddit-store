Not only is is it bad for your well-being to have poor / insufficient sleep, it's bad for her young daughter to be up so late.\n\nShe's TA especially for the \"you're not meant to be with someone with a kid\", and doubly so since they're the guests in your home.\n\nThat said, you probably shouldn't advise her on how to raise her daughter - just stick to the boundary of what you need for yourself.", "NTA. It's your house, your rules. If the kid being up is going to wake you up, it's not like moving her to another room is going to work. Kids are noisy. Also, I get that it's not really your business or say because its not your kid, but 2am is really too late for a kid that age. They naturally should be waking up really early, crashing and having a nap in the afternoon, and then going to bed no later than 10pm, and even that's late for that age.\n\nLol at \"maybe you're not ready to be with someone with a kid.\" Most people with a kid put them to bed at a reasonable hour and don't force a toddler to stay up that late so the toddler can accommodate the adult's late night schedule. It's kind of the parent's job to cater to the toddler's need to get up early. I bet the kid is still doing that and is now constantly deprived of sleep.\n\nYeah lady, nobody is ready to be with a person that won't put their kid down at a reasonable hour and won't let someone set boundaries in their own space.", "NTA\nShe is being disrespectful of you\nAnd a child should not be up that late, it\u2019s extremely unhealthy and setting her up for sleep problems", "NTA. Letting a 3 year old stay up in your bedroom when you have to be awake at 6 am is literal insanity. It\u2019s unbelievably disrespectful of her to do this- it literally wouldn\u2019t matter what it was, her doing/having anything in your bedroom that is keeping you awake that late is beyond rude. It\u2019s also insane to me to let a 3 year old stay up that late. Does she sleep until noon?\n\nYour girlfriend is rude and clearly doesn\u2019t care about you or respecting your life/home/schedule. While I always say parents need to put their kids first, there is always a way to do that while also respecting other people. \n\nHonestly? I\u2019d seriously look at this relationship.

I think it's a reasonable request to get distractions out of your room when you have to be up early. It's also reasonable to expect that a kid should have a bedtime, especially a 3 year old??? Idk if I'd be with someone who doesn't set boundaries with their kid and lets them stay up all hours of the night. A teenager, ok sure whatever maybe you're just a permissive parent. But this is a toddler.", "That\u2019s too late to stay up for a child. The woman is disrespectful. Also how did she not put two and two together?

I have 2 kids, well they\u2019re about grown now, and I promise you most of the time when they were young I was winging it the whole way.  But you have to try, you have to at least make an effort and keep trying different things if one thing isn\u2019t working.  Your gf doesn\u2019t appear to be trying.
