I certainly don't want to be in there, in the trenches, WHILE it is happening!!! \n\nBut, for real, if everyone is super conflict avoidant, I would suggest going the route of extreme passive aggression. The next time they started shrieking at each other, ask if they need their hearing checked or just straight up say \"we can al hear you. You don't need to yell at someone in the same room.\"\n\nIf they try to bodyslam a door down, ask them if they plan on replacing the hinges. If the gf starts in with \"what are you gonna do?\" You should do it with her and say, equally as enthusiastic, \"yeah bro, omg, what ARE you gonna do?!\""]}
