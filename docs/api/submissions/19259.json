They need to realize it's not about the money", "Your ex was being manipulative by telling the kids because she knew they'd be upset and make you feel guilty. Normally I'd say prioritize what the kids want, but not in this case, that was not okay.", "Wow. Your ex and her father are the biggest assholes in the whole world for using the kids to get their way. This is a super tough situation now that they dumped the problem on the children.

She's TA for making you look like a bad person to them", "NTA. You're following the court ordered visitation schedule.", "NTA. Kids won't understand custody days. It's an AH move that they told the kids the plans and an AH move for booking a trip during the days you would have them. Now the kids are being taught that you're stopping them from going on a fun trip which makes you the bad guy in their eyes.", "NTA: because it is the time you will have them they can plan it for a other time", "NTA.

They\u2019ll get over it, and you should never feel like you need to give up your court-granted residential time with your kids.", "NTA. Your ex is TA for telling the kids about the proposed trip. That's using the kids to either manipulate you into agreeing, or punish you. Not cool at all.  That kind of behavior is terrible for the kids. \n\nIt's unclear whether your FIL is also TA. He may be trying to be a good grandpa and take the kids on a fun trip. Offering to compensate you for the money you already spent is reasonable. But if he's trying to help your ex emotionally manipulate the kids, that's a dick move. This should be a lesson learned for him to step back and let you work things out with your ex.\n\nOverall, it's up to the parents to work out what's best for the kids in terms of summer scheduling, come to an agreement, and not involve the kids (especially young ones) in their issues or negotiations. There's nothing wrong with changing plans around from what the agreement says, if it benefits the kids overall. The purpose of the agreement is really to have a fallback and default, but it doesn't have to be set in stone.", "NTA. Sure, it's a great opportunity for them to go overseas, but why couldn't they plan the trip for a time that DIDN'T conflict with your parenting time, especially on a kid's birthday? I see this as a backhanded way of taking the celebration away from you and giving it to them. \n\nYeah, it's about what's best for the kids, but fostering relationships with BOTH parents, making sure BOTH parents get to celebrate birthdays with the kids, and not making one parent look like the bad guy are very important things for the kids. Working together is what's best for the kids. \n\nTell them that they can take the kids overseas after the birthday celebration with you. \n\nIf they cared about what was best for the kids, they would have checked with you first, scheduled it so you could still keep your plans, and worked around the birthday. They wouldn't try to alienate you. That's BAD parenting.", "NTA.   Ex is an asshole for telling the kids, FIl is one for not planning this ahead more.   Have a great summer, your ex owes the kids an apology", "Info: how old are the kids?", "NTA", "NTA, but the last-minute plans your ex is trying to force is making me a little paranoid. Something tells me that if you agree to this, she will end up doing something really terrible, and you will have very little legal recourse available.", "NTA, but set your own price for your FIL and make it outrageous. Tell him you'll accept triple of what everything has cost you (time is money too), and if he agrees, let your kids go and promise them a new PS5 and a Nintendo Swith with your FIL's money when he gets back.

NTA for wanting to stick to the custody arrangement and be there for the birthday but kinda the AH for not trying to be more flexible so your children can have more opportunities and life experiences.

Put down some ground rules like no birthdays or special occasions can be during these weeks so both parents can be there for those.

Some divorced parents are so good at coparenting and being decent to each other while putting the kids first. \n\nMy suggestion would be to talk to the kid who is having the birthday and find out which they would prefer. If they would like to celebrate on the trip with your ex, then let them do that and do your celebration when they come back. If they would prefer to celebrate with you and not do the trip, then let your ex know. \n\nI also think the title of this post is misleading. Your former FIL is not trying to pay you to be compliant, he offered to pay you because you said you\u2019d be out a lot of money from things you already have planned. It sounds like he tried to pay you for the inconvenience of this being a \u201clast minute\u201d thing.", "NTA. 1) They should not make plans during your time with the children without your prior agreement. 2) They absolutely should not then TELL the children \u201cdaddy said no\u201d to make you out like the villain. Manipulative and dreadful parenting from them.", "Your ex was the asshole for telling the kids about plans that werent happening,that werent on her time, and that would upset them to miss. Its a very gross blatant attempt to get them to beg you and make you feel bad, and its manipulative and selfish of your ex", "NTA. Good job putting yourself first and trusting your gut. You're right to leave. Hopefully this serves as a wake-up call and she doesn't carry that behavior into other relationships. But if she does, then at least it's not your problem", "Easier to ask for forgiveness than seek permission.", "This is a bit far fetched. If they wanted to kidnap the kids, they wouldn\u2019t ask him to switch his days, they\u2019d just take the kids", "This was my concern too! \n\nIf this is something the ex seems capable of, OP should consider contacting the appropriate authorities to flag the children's passports.", "Yup. Even say to your kids that it's out of your hands or something", "Agree with everything you said but this:\n\n>Tell them that they can take the kids overseas after the birthday celebration with you. \n\nGiven this revelation of how underhanded they can be, OP should not allow them to travel overseas *at all.* Manipulative exes can and do abduct their children all the time.", "Why couldn't the mom's family arrange the trip for her custody time? There's no mention of any specific event that they're planning to attend. Just an ordinary trip. Sounds like a power play on mom's part.", "How do you know traveling overseas is a once in a lifetime opportunity?  It seems to me that if Gramps is throwing all this money around the timing is not that important to him except to screw dad over.  The rationale of we can celebrate the birthday on the trip is totally missing the point.  Dad made plans to celebrate with his kids.  He cant get that back.  Yeah divorce sucks but asking children what they want is the worst kind of manipulation.", "And if the kids get kidnapped and he never sees them again? That money will feel great then \ud83d\ude44", "Sorry, being a push over that allows your ex to make unreasonable requests to change the custody agreement is not a solution. Avoiding conflict is generally advisable, but sometimes conflict can\u2019t be avoided because one of the parties is being unreasonable. In this case, the ex and her father are being unreasonable. This is something you bring up months in advance and not last minute. And as I have learned the hard way as a parent, you can\u2019t really \u201cmake up\u201d time with your kids, especially during those summer months. \n\nAn overseas trip is a cool experience, but that does not mean OP should let them go. It being a cool experience does not automatically make it \u201cwhat is best for the child.\u201d", "You can block their passports with the state department. I highly suggest OP does this. It\u2019s easy enough. I don\u2019t have an ex or custody issues but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be comfortable with this situation, especially with how manipulative they\u2019re being.", "Agreed. They\u2019d likely do it in their own days, not to raise suspicions. Then the kids just\u2026don\u2019t come back.", "You can file kidnapping charges, but if the country they all moved to doesn't extradite and they never leave that country again then the kid will stay kidnapped until they reach adulthood.", "If you have yet to see this I feel that this https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143whku/aita_for_telling_my_former_father_in_law_he_cant/jncu9bp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3 is a good route if the keep down this dark path", "Further INFO: when did they all get passports?", "Most people don't travel overseas and it's getting harder to with inflation.", "Oh reddit.
