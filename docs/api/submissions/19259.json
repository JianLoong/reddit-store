They need to realize it's not about the money", "Your ex was being manipulative by telling the kids because she knew they'd be upset and make you feel guilty. Normally I'd say prioritize what the kids want, but not in this case, that was not okay.", "Wow. Your ex and her father are the biggest assholes in the whole world for using the kids to get their way. This is a super tough situation now that they dumped the problem on the children.

She's TA for making you look like a bad person to them", "NTA. You're following the court ordered visitation schedule.", "NTA. Kids won't understand custody days. It's an AH move that they told the kids the plans and an AH move for booking a trip during the days you would have them. Now the kids are being taught that you're stopping them from going on a fun trip which makes you the bad guy in their eyes.", "NTA: because it is the time you will have them they can plan it for a other time", "NTA.

They\u2019ll get over it, and you should never feel like you need to give up your court-granted residential time with your kids.", "NTA. Your ex is TA for telling the kids about the proposed trip. That's using the kids to either manipulate you into agreeing, or punish you. Not cool at all.  That kind of behavior is terrible for the kids. \n\nIt's unclear whether your FIL is also TA. He may be trying to be a good grandpa and take the kids on a fun trip. Offering to compensate you for the money you already spent is reasonable. But if he's trying to help your ex emotionally manipulate the kids, that's a dick move. This should be a lesson learned for him to step back and let you work things out with your ex.\n\nOverall, it's up to the parents to work out what's best for the kids in terms of summer scheduling, come to an agreement, and not involve the kids (especially young ones) in their issues or negotiations. There's nothing wrong with changing plans around from what the agreement says, if it benefits the kids overall. The purpose of the agreement is really to have a fallback and default, but it doesn't have to be set in stone.", "NTA. Sure, it's a great opportunity for them to go overseas, but why couldn't they plan the trip for a time that DIDN'T conflict with your parenting time, especially on a kid's birthday? I see this as a backhanded way of taking the celebration away from you and giving it to them. \n\nYeah, it's about what's best for the kids, but fostering relationships with BOTH parents, making sure BOTH parents get to celebrate birthdays with the kids, and not making one parent look like the bad guy are very important things for the kids. Working together is what's best for the kids. \n\nTell them that they can take the kids overseas after the birthday celebration with you. \n\nIf they cared about what was best for the kids, they would have checked with you first, scheduled it so you could still keep your plans, and worked around the birthday. They wouldn't try to alienate you. That's BAD parenting.", "NTA.   Ex is an asshole for telling the kids, FIl is one for not planning this ahead more.   Have a great summer, your ex owes the kids an apology", "Info: how old are the kids?", "NTA", "NTA, but the last-minute plans your ex is trying to force is making me a little paranoid. Something tells me that if you agree to this, she will end up doing something really terrible, and you will have very little legal recourse available.", "NTA, but set your own price for your FIL and make it outrageous. Tell him you'll accept triple of what everything has cost you (time is money too), and if he agrees, let your kids go and promise them a new PS5 and a Nintendo Swith with your FIL's money when he gets back.

NTA for wanting to stick to the custody arrangement and be there for the birthday but kinda the AH for not trying to be more flexible so your children can have more opportunities and life experiences.

Put down some ground rules like no birthdays or special occasions can be during these weeks so both parents can be there for those.

Tell him with the kids also hearing \"I cannot believe you think I would value my kids so little, even if it is a vacation I wouldn't take it unless it was X amount\". Flip that back on him NTA", "So the ex and her father are fine with using the kids as weapons.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your ex did this on purpose.", "Alienation of the other parent is not ok. I'd report that to the court.", "I feel like everyone is trying too hard to make this a bigger thing than it is. Yes, some people do kidnap their kids and try to break custody agreements on purpose, but this is certainly not every case. Assuming OP normally has a decent coparenting relationship with the ex (his post gives no reason to think otherwise), this could be just a simple custody issue that wasn\u2019t handled in the best way. OP\u2019s ex knows what the custody arrangement is, but her father likely doesn\u2019t know the details. He could just as likely had gotten the chance to travel overseas and thought he could make it a chance to bond with his grandchildren. He asks OP\u2019s ex, who then asks OP because she knows that it cuts into his time. The only thing handled wrong here was telling the kids before the trip was set in stone.", "Same. My dad is a narcissist so I\u2019m probably pretty biased but there were so many times I was upset he ruined things I was looking forward to. It was always about his plans, his wants, and his needs all on his time. The mom definitely sucks in this situation too for instigating this but I wish it sounded like he cared about what his kids actually wanted a little more.", "So you\u2019re ok with the parental alienation?", "So she planned bad, but expects OP to change her plans, and she told the kids about it when OP said no which is unacceptable.", "Maybe it\u2019s not last minute. Maybe this has been planned all along. Considering the manipulation tactics they\u2019re using on the kids to make OP the bad guy, I wouldn\u2019t be one bit surprised if this is true.", "NTA, it sucks they told the kids they knew what they were doing. You\u2019re smart not to give into him now, if you do he\u2019ll think he do whatever he wants", "ESPECIALLY Telling the kids after he told the ex and father no was a big fuck you to him... Simply for the fact they KNOW how the kids will react to a \"more exciting trip\"", "Likely mad that OP gets the birthday kid on their birthday and wanted a reason to make that change.", "OP\u2019s ex and her father may be able to spend more and give the kids great experiences. That doesn\u2019t justify reducing bonding time between OP and his children.\n\nThe ex should have negotiated for a change in custodial time before planning any trips and DEFINITELY before telling the kids. She is being the bad parent while setting OP up to look like one to the kids.\n\nThe ex is a true AH. OP is NTA.", "Oh 100%. They knew it wouldn\u2019t work out so they told the kids so they\u2019d be mad that OP \u201ccanceled their trip\u201d", "Ah the old classic \u201coh no, we don\u2019t get to do *exciting thing* because of stingy old *other parent*. What a jerk\u201d.", "Man the leaps that people make on here are wild", "Hanlon's razor would suggest grandpa just planned the trip as a surprise and didn't think about the logistics or thought that OP wouldn't have an issue", "The ex is a woman.", "Plus imagine if OP agreed to let them pay for his days? \"Your dad sold you guys so that we can spend more days with you\"\n\nEx just wants to have their way", "And the exes father should not be involved at all in custody arrangement", "Agreed", "This doesn't feel like a one up situation. I also don't get the impression they're trying to keep the kids apart from OP, I got the impression they just want to take a vacation with the kids. \n\nMy ex and I were always flexible with the schedules in the Summer, why not be? Make sure the kids have the most experiences and the most fun they can. Isn't that what it's supposed to be about?", "There's nothing wrong with checking all your boxes though. You'd be surprised with the amount of \"dramatization\" can help people realize a few things in their life from an outsiders opinion.\n\nAlso, the ex knew of OP's days with the kids, yet finalized their booking without OP's expressed consent or at least letting OP know in the first place. Seems kind of suspicious to many, including me. If the FIL didn't know, then the fault lies with the ex since she's jeopardizing both her father, the kids, and OP.", "I don\u2019t see where he says that it is once in a lifetime or even that they have never been.  Only that it was last minute and overseas.  I see where you said that but not OP.", "Thank you.", "When there are custody arrangements, all adults need to plan around them. The parent with more money to spend shouldn\u2019t manipulate the kids to get what they want. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening here & it\u2019s shameful.", "Because this kind of manipulation can be done again and again. \n\nIf the grandfather and ex can afford special trips and events, then this could just be the first attempt to take over every birthday and holiday with the kids. \n\nWhat happens at Christmas if OP has the kids but the ex books an extravagant Christmas in Disney vacation? Or suggests to the kids that they could go if OP wasn\u2019t standing in the way. \n\nSome divorced parents use their greater financial resources to cause parental alienation. That could very well be the case here. \n\nOP already has plans for spending time with the kids and has a legal and agreed-upon right to do so. Why should he cancel his time because his ex/her father can pay for more extravagant plans?", "OP refused to change visitation times (as is his right) and the ex still told the kids about the planned trip. The ex may not be acting with malice but she is willing to harm her children and their relationship with OP to get her way.\n\nJust because it\u2019s not an overseas trip doesn\u2019t mean that OP should cancel all his plans - including the planned birthday party for his child. \n\nGood parents make accommodations, treat each other with respect, and try not to involve the kids with their issues. OP\u2019s ex is not being a good parent.", "In this case he should say this. \"If I let you go now, there is a chance the court will cancel our together days in future\". It's a solid reason.", "Yeah, it heavily depends on their relationship. In a healthy coparenting relationship, day swapping is incredibly common, but if they aren't in a good relationship with each other, then court is a very real possibility."]}
