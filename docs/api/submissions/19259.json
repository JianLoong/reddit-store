Why can\u2019t ex and her father change their plans?", "NTA. It was really crappy of your ex FIL to tell the kids about the trip before having permission so they'd be disappointed. It's also crap of your ex and FIL to plan a trip during your days and during one of your kid's birthdays. They can take the trip on their days. They need to realize it's not about the money", "Your ex was being manipulative by telling the kids because she knew they'd be upset and make you feel guilty. Normally I'd say prioritize what the kids want, but not in this case, that was not okay.", "Wow. Your ex and her father are the biggest assholes in the whole world for using the kids to get their way. This is a super tough situation now that they dumped the problem on the children. I\u2019d say NTA. What are they going to do next? Probably tell the kids \u201cgrandpas house is much better than dads! Don\u2019t you all want to stay here for good?\u201d", "NTA \n\nIs there any concern that they might not be returned after being overseas? I understand many people have the means for international travel, but I also know of can be used to keep the children away from their parent. I\u2019m especially concerned because of the last minute plans, and seeming urgency to bribe you to get them away \n\nMy gawsh it\u2019s not that hard to look at the custody agreement and a calendar when planning a major trip like that", "NTA\nDon't give up any moments with your kids. She's TA for making you look like a bad person to them", "NTA. You're following the court ordered visitation schedule.", "NTA. Kids won't understand custody days. It's an AH move that they told the kids the plans and an AH move for booking a trip during the days you would have them. Now the kids are being taught that you're stopping them from going on a fun trip which makes you the bad guy in their eyes.", "NTA: because it is the time you will have them they can plan it for a other time", "NTA. She sucks for putting the kids in the middle by telling them about the trip. They\u2019ll get over it, and you should never feel like you need to give up your court-granted residential time with your kids.", "NTA. Your ex is TA for telling the kids about the proposed trip. That's using the kids to either manipulate you into agreeing, or punish you. Not cool at all.  That kind of behavior is terrible for the kids. \n\nIt's unclear whether your FIL is also TA. He may be trying to be a good grandpa and take the kids on a fun trip. Offering to compensate you for the money you already spent is reasonable. But if he's trying to help your ex emotionally manipulate the kids, that's a dick move. This should be a lesson learned for him to step back and let you work things out with your ex.\n\nOverall, it's up to the parents to work out what's best for the kids in terms of summer scheduling, come to an agreement, and not involve the kids (especially young ones) in their issues or negotiations. There's nothing wrong with changing plans around from what the agreement says, if it benefits the kids overall. The purpose of the agreement is really to have a fallback and default, but it doesn't have to be set in stone.", "NTA. Sure, it's a great opportunity for them to go overseas, but why couldn't they plan the trip for a time that DIDN'T conflict with your parenting time, especially on a kid's birthday? I see this as a backhanded way of taking the celebration away from you and giving it to them. \n\nYeah, it's about what's best for the kids, but fostering relationships with BOTH parents, making sure BOTH parents get to celebrate birthdays with the kids, and not making one parent look like the bad guy are very important things for the kids. Working together is what's best for the kids. \n\nTell them that they can take the kids overseas after the birthday celebration with you. \n\nIf they cared about what was best for the kids, they would have checked with you first, scheduled it so you could still keep your plans, and worked around the birthday. They wouldn't try to alienate you. That's BAD parenting.", "NTA.   Ex is an asshole for telling the kids, FIl is one for not planning this ahead more.   Have a great summer, your ex owes the kids an apology", "Info: how old are the kids?", "NTA", "NTA, but the last-minute plans your ex is trying to force is making me a little paranoid. Something tells me that if you agree to this, she will end up doing something really terrible, and you will have very little legal recourse available.", "NTA, but set your own price for your FIL and make it outrageous. Tell him you'll accept triple of what everything has cost you (time is money too), and if he agrees, let your kids go and promise them a new PS5 and a Nintendo Swith with your FIL's money when he gets back. They will be thrilled and won't love you any less.\n\nFIL will likely say no, but they won't bug you any more and you win either way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I hope you get to enjoy your plans with them this summer.", "NTA. But I'll document it and talk to your lawyer about alienation of affection and trying to turn the kids. I bet a judge wouldn't take it very kindly... I bet this is not the first time or the last, better nip it now. Have a great summer!", "NTA, and i hope you told your former FIL, to keep his nose out of your and your ex's business in the future at the same time. Why is it after all the emotion and angst of setting up custody arrangements, that people then want to change things, upset kids again, and bring up all those bad feelings again. Stick to your guns mate.", "NTA, would it be reaching to call what your ex did parental alienation? Because it kind of feels like what she's trying to do.", "To the specific question of telling your former father-in-law that he can't buy compliance: NTA, that was awesome.\n\nTo the related questions of: should you block your kids from going on a cool vacation because you made your own different plans? Completely separate issue, and it sounds like maybe you should wait till your temper cools and give it a good think.", "I get what \\*you\\* want. But what do your kids want?", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour ex should not have mentioned the potential trip to the kids without getting your agreement first. But you don't seem to be taking any consideration to what's best for the kids. \n\nTo me the details also matter. \"Overseas trip\" could be no big deal to miss out on, depending on where you live, where they're going, and the duration. \"Overseas trip\" could also be an amazing travel opportunity if it's more like \"US kids going on a European Tour\" or whatever.", "If the kids go\u2026\n\n1.

However, the real question is what is best for the kids. A trip overseas is an amazing opportunity for the kids. \n\nIf you gave them paid events as the reason the kids can't go, offering to reimburse you is reasonable to some people.

Presumably there's a need gor permission to take the kids out of the country.\n\nThe only assholes here are ex and her father who should've talked to him 6 mos ago or whenever they got the idea instead of booking at, thinking they could force him to concede, and also for using the kids to guilt him.\n\nHe needs to let the authorities know his ex doesn't have permission for international travel", "I'd have to disagree a bit but I don't know his ex.\n\nMy brother is in family court battling his ex for custody of his daughter and it took him a year to get time sharing. Now, every little change has to be documented since she will usually go back on her promises. He had to file in court that he could see her Father's day since it isn't his weekend.\n\nInfo I would like... would she be switching days with him so he gets the same amount of time? How open are they to custody agreement changes? \n\nI do agree if it is an easy thing, let the kids go and then celebrate with them later/before. A few days won't hurt, but that dang custody agreement.", "I get what you're saying but question whether a trip overseas is \"best for the kids\" or if it's just what the ex's family wants to do because adults think it would be fun.", "The paranoia in me says that a last-minute change in plans for a trip might result in something nefarious going on with very little legal recourse available. Sure, this doesn't always happen, but I have read stories where the excuse of a trip or holiday was merely a front for something worse that will happen.\n\nI wouldn't have batted an eyelid if the trip was planned during her custody time, though.", "That's what I thought as I was reading this. Regardless of what I thought of how the other side made their plans, I would want my kids to experience the most in life with the understanding it won't always be with me. I would probably just make sure the arrangement is fair in that I get my fair share of custodial days in exchange and that future birthdays will be better planned out.", "I agree. As a parent, one should be flexible. Plans change all the time due to life being unpredictable. What\u2019s important is what\u2019s best for the kids. Clearly they want to be on that trip.

But it's easy to make hasty decisions when your temper is up.", "the hague treaty", ">OP is just being difficult out of spite.\n\nCan't you fathom why a parent wants to be with their child on their birthday?", "Disagree - too many red flags there. Planning trip without asking OP. Telling kids prior to OP. Trying to bribe OP. This tells me they are underhanded, and will use this as leverage and precedent.", "Is the mother not a parent? Again, what\u2019s the best for the children here? Sometimes you just have to put aside your selfish wish for your beloved ones. It\u2019s the kid\u2019s birthday not OP\u2019s anyway. So why do you want the birthday kid to lose out on an overseas trip (which they were excited for) because ONE of the parents doesn\u2019t want it due to a plan they could postpone? What\u2019s so difficult about rearranging your plans to make life better for your kids (remember the grandfather tries to accommodate OP financially too)?", "And for that reason, you are advising the OP against thinking?", "NTA. Her father can plan his trip around your custody dates. Your ex is a complete AH for telling the kids about the trip and making you look like the bad guy.", "NTA. If they had simply asked OP if he was willing to swap the dates and accepted the no, it would have been NAH. However, the ex is a huge AH for telling the kids about the trip. She was either trying to guilt you into saying yes or she was trying to make the kids angry with OP. Either way, she is a piece of work for hurting her kids to be petty.", "YTA? I dunno. \n\nI do know you're keeping the kids from having an overseas trip. \n\nIs that a regular thing, or did you F their once in a lifetime opportunity because you hate their GrandPa? \n\nI'll add, I think Gramps is right, the birthday can be celebrated on vacation. \n\nHow do the kids feel? How petty do you want to be? Why not take the cash and negotiate more days later? \n\nDivorced parents suck, usually both sides.", "NTA. Fight fire with fire. I\u2019d tell the kids that the trip wasn\u2019t happening because of FIL\u2019s poor planning. Then again its kinda trashy to involve the kids (even though that\u2019s exactly what he did)\n\nEither way, I bet that they will forget about that trip while having a fun time with their dad :)", "NTA if your in the US she can\u2019t take your kids out of the country without a document that gives her the permission to do so.  If she tries to take them without the legal letter she could be charged with kidnapping or some other similar offense.  You can not take children out of the country without proper documents such as a passport, custody documents, and the letter giving the other parent permission to take them.  This is also the case when traveling out of their home state, no passport but a document giving permission to go out of state and to which state they are traveling to.  I wanted to take my kids to visit my family, my ex said no.  I contacted my attorney and they told me without his permission in writing they couldn\u2019t go.", "They did an end run round your refusal and tried to turn the kids against you. If you give in now they will do this again.", "NTA, they are your days and, honestly, this is a matter between the adults, your ex never should have told the kids about the issue they were having. \n\nThe kids will understand your side of it when they are older.", "NTA ex is a massive A, she's manipulating her own children hoping they'll get upset enough that you change your mind, you should call her out on this", "Manipulation, plain and simple. Tell them, knowing other parent probably already has plans and will say no. This way other parent looks like the bad guy.", "We'll have no logic here! Deal only in emotion!!", "I am wondering if this is their plan, too.  I wouldn\u2019t be letting anybody take my kids overseas\u2026or even to another state.", "Yeah! Its one thing to offer to pay him off but it\u2019s another to use a trip to turn his own young kids against the idea of a birthday with their dad", "Oh no! Miss the big birthday party where they ignore the parents and play with their friends?"]}
