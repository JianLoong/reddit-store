My mom is bi, and my parents divorced when I was ten, after that she met and them married my stepmom when I was 12, my dad's still single. Anyway I actually really love my stepmom, she treats me like I'm her own kid, she listens to me, and her daughter (14F) and I are very close sisters now.\n\nI've been calling both of them mom for a few years, because I honestly see both of them that way. My dad for some reason doesn't like that. He thinks I got attached to her way too soon, and that she's either spoiling me or manipulating me to do it. He doesn't really like her and you can tell, I'll mention something we did together and he ignores me.\n\nAnyway I was at my dads for the weekend, and I had to call my stepmom to tell her to pick some stuff up for me when I got home. At the end I just said \"Ok, love you mom bye.\" and my dad heard, he was all \"was that mom or (stepmoms name)\" When I said who it was he told me to stop calling her mom, she isn't mine and it's disrespectful to my real mother to do that. He also said it makes him feel bad since she's only been in my life six years.\n\nI got sick of it and yelled at him. I called him homophobic and jealous, I said he doesn't care if I'm happy or not. I even said he was a bad dad for not wanting me to have more people I love in my life. in the end I told him unless he shut up about this, I'm not visiting anymore, and left a little after that.\n\nNow the whole family is upset. My moms are upset because my dad and I usualky get along great, and they're sad they're making issues like this. My sister's upset because her dad's dead and she doesn't want me to lose mine. Basically everybody's sad that I blew up like that, and Now I feel shitty for blowing up when I could've just let it go.", "created_utc": 1687048829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c6m5m/aita_for_yelling_at_my_dad_when_he_told_me_to/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get everyone's upset, but the situation was upsetting - to you, at least, *long* before they ever knew there was a problem. Now they're pressuring you to go back to a time when they didn't have to acknowledge that your dad's an asshole, and you were the only one suffering.\n\nFrankly, it's unworthy of them. They now know there's a problem, and they should be working on a way to help you find a solution to it, not pressuring you to sweep it back under the rug so everyone but you can go on ignoring it again. Your dad *earned* that outburst. Don't you dare take it back. He needed to hear it.\n\nForgive him if he finds a way to learn from it and tries to become a better man, but detach yourself to whatever feels like a safe distance if he won't or can't.", "NTA. You can call whoever you want, whatever they want as long as they're ok with it.", "NTA. It may be good to sit your dad down and explain that while you love your step mum, it doesn't mean that you love him any  less or see him as less of a parent. He's probably feeling a bit jealous & insecure- that's a normal feeling and we can't help how we feel, even if deep down we know it's not a rational thought.\n\nI'm not saying his reaction is right, but yelling at him also isn't the right way to go about it. Maybe he just needs you to let him know that your step mum isn't replacing him.", "If your bio mom isn\u2019t bothered by your calling her partner Mom also, I don\u2019t see why anyone else should care. It\u2019s great you get along well with your parent, step parent and step sibling and your Dad should be supporting that. 6 years is plenty of time to bond with a newer family member and feel comfortable with attachment to them. NTA.", "NTA. You're right he is jealous. And possibly homophobic.", "NTA.   I can see him not wanting anyone called dad, but if your mom thinks \"mom\" name is reserved for her, she can tell you.", "NTA It's none of your father's business what you call your stepmother. He didn't need to comment about it, he chose to bring it up, make you uncomfortable and defensive. Blowing up is never helpful but everyone has their limits. Let everything settle down and just explain to your father your relationship with your stepmother and what you call her is between you and your stepmother, it's none of his business, it's not going to change and he needs drop it. You're an adult, he needs to move on and get over the fact his former wife is in a happy, healthy same sex relationship.", "NTA, honestly I would tell you that there's no need to scream at him but i would have done the same so I can't.", "This really isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business (your moms, your sisters etc).  This is between you and your dad.  \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t think you were wrong to call your dad out.  He needs to deal with his issues on his own, what you call your stepmom isn\u2019t his business either.  NTA.", "NTA, maybe super soft ESH. Your dad was in the wrong but it was a bit bold of you to call him homophobic. He\u2019s jealous that his ex has a new partner but he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s normal for people to feel jealousy but this is bad, he still hasn\u2019t moved on. The only thing you were in the wrong for is calling him homophobic, because based on what info you\u2019ve given us his behavior isn\u2019t homophobic.", "NTA but you\u2019re going to be an adult soon and you\u2019re going to have to learn to disagree with people without screaming  at them. You certainly didn\u2019t help anyone\u2019s position at all.", "NTA.  You're not the one putting your relationship with your father at risk--he is.  It is disrespectful to you and your mothers for him to try to micromanage your relationship with them.  Let's say you didn't call him out.  What then?  You just get more and more resentful until there isn't really a relationship left to save?  That might be a slower death for the relationship, but at least this way your dad has the chance to fix things before it's too late.  Your moms are feeling guilty and your stepsister is projecting, but they're all barking up the wrong tree.  This isn't about them; it's about your dad needing to respect your feelings and boundaries.  \n\nCould you have handled the situation better?  Probably.  Setting your boundaries calm, firmly, and early is often the best way to go.  But you could have done a lot worse, and your boundary is now crystal clear.

Sometime you gotta ask yourself, what am i going to gain if i blow up and get angry?...Eben if you are right, somwtimes it does not pay to get angry.\n\nYou still have time to learn and back pedal... say you are sorry for over reacting, but you do mean what you said and calling your step mom \"mom\" is not going to change, so best he get over it or keep it to himself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
