My mom is bi, and my parents divorced when I was ten, after that she met and them married my stepmom when I was 12, my dad's still single. Anyway I actually really love my stepmom, she treats me like I'm her own kid, she listens to me, and her daughter (14F) and I are very close sisters now.\n\nI've been calling both of them mom for a few years, because I honestly see both of them that way. My dad for some reason doesn't like that. He thinks I got attached to her way too soon, and that she's either spoiling me or manipulating me to do it. He doesn't really like her and you can tell, I'll mention something we did together and he ignores me.\n\nAnyway I was at my dads for the weekend, and I had to call my stepmom to tell her to pick some stuff up for me when I got home. At the end I just said \"Ok, love you mom bye.\" and my dad heard, he was all \"was that mom or (stepmoms name)\" When I said who it was he told me to stop calling her mom, she isn't mine and it's disrespectful to my real mother to do that. He also said it makes him feel bad since she's only been in my life six years.\n\nI got sick of it and yelled at him. I called him homophobic and jealous, I said he doesn't care if I'm happy or not. I even said he was a bad dad for not wanting me to have more people I love in my life. in the end I told him unless he shut up about this, I'm not visiting anymore, and left a little after that.\n\nNow the whole family is upset. My moms are upset because my dad and I usualky get along great, and they're sad they're making issues like this. My sister's upset because her dad's dead and she doesn't want me to lose mine. Basically everybody's sad that I blew up like that, and Now I feel shitty for blowing up when I could've just let it go.", "created_utc": 1687048829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14c6m5m/aita_for_yelling_at_my_dad_when_he_told_me_to/", "score": 141, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They now know there's a problem, and they should be working on a way to help you find a solution to it, not pressuring you to sweep it back under the rug so everyone but you can go on ignoring it again. Your dad *earned* that outburst. Don't you dare take it back.

It may be good to sit your dad down and explain that while you love your step mum, it doesn't mean that you love him any  less or see him as less of a parent.

I can see him not wanting anyone called dad, but if your mom thinks \"mom\" name is reserved for her, she can tell you.", "NTA It's none of your father's business what you call your stepmother. He didn't need to comment about it, he chose to bring it up, make you uncomfortable and defensive. Blowing up is never helpful but everyone has their limits. Let everything settle down and just explain to your father your relationship with your stepmother and what you call her is between you and your stepmother, it's none of his business, it's not going to change and he needs drop it.

It is disrespectful to you and your mothers for him to try to micromanage your relationship with them.  Let's say you didn't call him out.  What then?  You just get more and more resentful until there isn't really a relationship left to save?  That might be a slower death for the relationship, but at least this way your dad has the chance to fix things before it's too late.

This isn't about them; it's about your dad needing to respect your feelings and boundaries.  \n\nCould you have handled the situation better?  Probably.
