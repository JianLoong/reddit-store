You're being asked to navigate some rough waters that you should not have to. \n\nWith all that pressure, plus normal teenage stuff, it's not surprising that you reacted the way that you did. However, it's also not healthy.

I can't know for sure without talking to him, but what I suspect is happening is that your dad really loves you, and wants to stay an important part of your life. Regardless of the circumstances of the divorce, he now doesn't get to see you as much as he'd like to, and he knows that other adults, especially your stepmom, are becoming increasingly important to you, which makes him feel like he's losing that much more of you.

Tell your moms that they are not responsible for your dad's choice to act homophobic and decide for your bio mom that you calling your stepmom \"mom\" as well is disrespectful to her (i.e. taking away her choice on what she finds respectful/disrespectful) and telling you this instead of letting your mom tell you herself if she truly felt disrespected. Sit down with your sister (you may want to have your moms there to help you explain this one well) and tell her that even families will have disagreements, but that doesn't mean they love each other less or break ties completely. Tell her that choices and actions have consequences and your dad made a choice to try to dictate to you how you should be addressing your stepmom (and therefore taking the choice away from you), and the consequence is that you got angry and have chosen to distance yourself from him for the moment. How long that distancing lasts will be his choice in how he continues to act, since his behavior is at least skirting homophobia if not being full blown homophobia, and you are choosing not to support his attitude. Make it clear that this doesn't mean you don't love your dad anymore, and that you won't ever have anything to do with him again, but you are exercising your right to your own choice of behavior.

Evidence: you screamed and stormed off and now literally everyone involved, including you, is upset. Sure, you had the moral high ground before you started screaming. Now tell me, where'd that get you?\n\n Take it from someone who has had their fair share of screaming fits over stupid crap, screaming and yelling will *literally never* get you what you want, unless all you want is to upset people. Again, even if you are 100% correct in every word that comes out your mouth, if those words are being screamed no one's going to change their mind and everyone's just going to end up more upset than they were at the start.\n\nI wanna be clear here that I'm not judging you, because you're SO young, but you also clearly need to hear this. \n\nYour father is a human who has feelings too. He's not right to try to police your relationship with your stepmom, but that by itself isn't a good reason to fuck up your relationship with him. Homophobia is one thing; having a personal dislike of the woman your ex-wife left you for is another thing entirely. (Whether bio mom left him \"for\" stepmom is beside the point, I'm just saying.) He's allowed to dislike her just as much as you're allowed to love her like a second mother. Again, he's not right to police your relationship with your stepmom, but he's got every right to have his own feelings and opinions about it. And if you expect him to respect YOUR feelings and opinions about it, you're going to have to sit down with him and do the work of TALKING it through, not shouting and not storming off when he doesn't immediately see your POV and agree with you.\n\n I'm not saying you should apologize for the things you said, but I am asking you to re-think your approach to *how* you say those things. \n\nI mean, unless you just like stirring the pot and upsetting everyone you claim to care about.", "Guys, I'm just telling you ahead of time that u/NoBrains-NoGains gave me an N-word pass I swear on my Robux\n\nEdit: lmao", "This", "They were divorced for ***seven years***. He still hasn\u2019t moved on.", ">When you grow up and have your own kids you will understand why.\n\nWhy? If you're so wise, explain why.", "Ugh they both sound horrible!! I hope that you accomplish amazing things, and then rub it in their faces that they had ZERO part in your success. They suck.", "Maybe you should examine if there was more to the divorce than you were lead to believe. Reddit is full of divorces where the kids were lead to believe a less messy story.\n\nIt's great that your new family functions well, but how did the breakup of the old one go. Did it and how hard did it hurt your dad. Did he feel discarded ?\n\nAnyway unless he is actually a bigot, in your reaction to him you have said things that cannot be ignored or forgotten by him and that you cannot take back.\n\nIf you still wish to have a relationship with him, you need to have a heart to heart with him and find out how the breakup hurt him and if and how you are hurting him.", "RIF.", "Disney appreciates the idea for their next woke remake of Parent Trap.", "Regardless of how the divorce happened, he should not be taking out whatever issues he has with the mom and her wife out on OP.", "Nor should the impact on him be ignored.\n\nIn the one hand op says she has 3 great parents. On the other hand she throws a tantrum of him being homophobic and him being a bad father.\n\nRegardless of which of the two  is true, he doesn't seem to get much empathy nor does anyone seem to ask about his feelings.\n\nHe's not some emotionless machine.\n\nAlso, op doesn't give a real reason for the divorce. Mom coming out as bi isn't the same as coming out as lesbian when married to a man.", "nope. context matters.", "The post does not say she came out as bi during their marriage.\n\nTeenagers should not know details of why their parents divorced, really. You're expecting something somewhat inappropriate.", "If it\u2019s impacted him so much he needs to go to therapy and deal with those emotions. Policing his daughter\u2019s relationships with the stepmom and coming up with bullshit excuses as to why she can\u2019t be called mom isn\u2019t helping his case at all. Maybe if he approached this in a better manner then maybe he would get empathy but he\u2019s a grown man and should know better. \n\nHow are you so willing to give this man empathy for a reason you\u2019ve made up and have no evidence suggesting it\u2019s true, than you are a 17 year old who\u2019s been hearing her dad demonize her stepmother for years who finally snapped back?", "It was the phone call that triggered him.  Not the word Mom but the feeling you put out in the call.  He heard you talk to her and got super jealous and maybe felt displaced.  Cuz I bet you don't call him and need him to do things in your daily life the same way.  You might as well have called her dad. \n\nYou did nothing wrong but I wonder if he's feeling that you might love \"mom\" more. \n\nHe is certainly the insecure one.  But maybe not a homophobe.  \n\nI have no easy answers. People are messy. Parents are imperfect.", "There is a middle ground between blowing up and letting it go. Both of those options are equally undesirable for different reasons. Your father is free to tell you his feelings just as you are free to share yours. Some sort of respectful way to say the following maybe?:  remind him that your private conversations don\u2019t require his approval, that since this isn\u2019t a safety issue, you\u2019ll keep your relationship with stepmom between you and stepmom, and that if he wants to discuss his hurt feelings with you, you\u2019ll listen. Didn\u2019t your dad know your mom was bisexual before you were created? Hurling accusations at him when he expressed his feelings may just be drama making. \n\nI\u2019m just barely voting YTA over everyone s u c k s here", "NTA. I don't know if your dad is homophobic or is still bitter over the divorce, but the reason doesn't matter. He's an adult and a father; he needs to put on his big boy pants and put aside whatever issues he has with your step-mom and be a good parent to you. Which includes acknowledging your close relationship with your step-mom. Otherwise, he's gonna drive you away completely.", "Nta\nYour Dad is jealous and needs to figure out why it bothers him so much. It would make more sense if your mom remarried a man and he felt he was being replaced. But his reasoning makes no sense and is frankly none of his business. Tbh, his response does sound homophobic.", "If your bio mum thought it was 'disrespectful' for you to call her partner 'mum', I'm sure she'd have said something to you before now.\n\nFrom your dad's reaction, I wouldn't mind betting there was more to the split than you know, maybe a long-running affair between bio mum and stepmum, stepmum pursuing and persuading bio mum to leave your dad etc. It doesn't have to be homophobic on his behalf, just plain old emotional hurt.\n\nIf he's up to it, and is willing to tell you, it might be worth asking him about his split with your bio mum, what happened leading up to the separation and divorce etc, just so you can understand things from his point of view.\n\nN T A for wanting to have, and having, a good relationship with your stepmum but a very soft YTA for yelling at your dad without knowing the full story. \n\nOf course, if it ***is*** all homophobia, then that's a different story", "NTA for calling her mom as long as YOUR BIO MOM is okay with it.  \n\nAnd possibly dad is jealous so A bit ESH for ragging on dad because you kind of have to understand that your mom left him for another woman and that has probably been harder for him to deal with than if it was a man. His idea of a \u2018family\u2019 possibly because of his upbringing is mom + dad = kids and not the extended 2 mom plus dad family.. he feels threatened", "Esh dad has no right to dictate your relationship with stepmom\nBut I fail to see the homophobia. He\u2019s obviously hurt and feeling like he\u2019s being replaced. Imagine how hurt he\u2019d be if your mom married a man and you called him dad. It\u2019s the same thing, and it would be cruel of you to do that in front of him", "Everybody is sad because your dad's homophobic rubbish is causing you pain.\n\nYou are NTA.", "Great answer.", "Don\u2019t know about the homophobic part though, I\u2019m 99% sure he would have reacted much more harshly if his ex married a man and she is on the phone saying \u201clove you, dad.\u201d", "Or, he's hurt that his wife left him for another woman and he may feel that his whole marriage was a lie. He feels bitter about that. Then his kid 'betrays' him by calling the stepmom 'mom' and all the hurt rushes to the surface again.\nThis is basically a step parent triangle - normally the step parent 'replaces' the parent and the child directs their anger and hurt towards them no matter how misplaced. In this occasion the step has replaced the partner. Same hurt.\nI would say NAH because it's op's choice to call her step parent anything they mutually agree on, but hurt and jealously make a person behave unreasonably- but it doesn't make them an ah. They need time and understanding and a light touch. If op normally gets on well with the dad then that's the most important point and they should help him cope rather than exacerbate the hurt.", "Seems like your dad is having a hard time processing emotions and is lashing out in you.

The fact that he\u2019s saying it\u2019s disrespectful to bio mom is his way of projecting: he feels like he\u2019s being replaced", "Not sure why you jumped there. He might still be upset at the divorce, lonely, or any number of things.", "Tbf we don't know the context. It could just be the whole step parent thing and not actual homophobia/biphobia.
