You're being asked to navigate some rough waters that you should not have to. \n\nWith all that pressure, plus normal teenage stuff, it's not surprising that you reacted the way that you did. However, it's also not healthy.

I can't know for sure without talking to him, but what I suspect is happening is that your dad really loves you, and wants to stay an important part of your life. Regardless of the circumstances of the divorce, he now doesn't get to see you as much as he'd like to, and he knows that other adults, especially your stepmom, are becoming increasingly important to you, which makes him feel like he's losing that much more of you. And I'm sure he's probably also thinking that the closer you get to 18 the closer you get to being able to decide for yourself who you want to spend your time with. \n\nAgain, whether I'm right about all that or not, it's not Ok for him to lash out at you about your relationship with your stepmom.

Blessings on all four of you.", "Yelling shouldnt be the go to, healthy communication is important and if doesnt feel like youre able to then take a break from the situation. NTA for what you were trying to say.", "NTA. Tell your moms that they are not responsible for your dad's choice to act homophobic and decide for your bio mom that you calling your stepmom \"mom\" as well is disrespectful to her (i.e. taking away her choice on what she finds respectful/disrespectful) and telling you this instead of letting your mom tell you herself if she truly felt disrespected. Sit down with your sister (you may want to have your moms there to help you explain this one well) and tell her that even families will have disagreements, but that doesn't mean they love each other less or break ties completely. Tell her that choices and actions have consequences and your dad made a choice to try to dictate to you how you should be addressing your stepmom (and therefore taking the choice away from you), and the consequence is that you got angry and have chosen to distance yourself from him for the moment. How long that distancing lasts will be his choice in how he continues to act, since his behavior is at least skirting homophobia if not being full blown homophobia, and you are choosing not to support his attitude. Make it clear that this doesn't mean you don't love your dad anymore, and that you won't ever have anything to do with him again, but you are exercising your right to your own choice of behavior. Tell her that people will come and go in life (although those going aren't usually family unless it's through death), and that it's ok. It just means that you are growing and learning and changing into who YOU want to be and what YOU want to believe.

Even if everything you said when you screamed and stormed off was true, screaming and storming off is a terrible way to get anyone at all to listen to anything at all, and is a great way to upset everyone involved. Evidence: you screamed and stormed off and now literally everyone involved, including you, is upset. Sure, you had the moral high ground before you started screaming. Now tell me, where'd that get you?\n\n Take it from someone who has had their fair share of screaming fits over stupid crap, screaming and yelling will *literally never* get you what you want, unless all you want is to upset people. Again, even if you are 100% correct in every word that comes out your mouth, if those words are being screamed no one's going to change their mind and everyone's just going to end up more upset than they were at the start.\n\nI wanna be clear here that I'm not judging you, because you're SO young, but you also clearly need to hear this. \n\nYour father is a human who has feelings too. He's not right to try to police your relationship with your stepmom, but that by itself isn't a good reason to fuck up your relationship with him. Homophobia is one thing; having a personal dislike of the woman your ex-wife left you for is another thing entirely. (Whether bio mom left him \"for\" stepmom is beside the point, I'm just saying.)

There's gotta be a way to fix this.", "You are NTA but at only 17 and have made some huge assumptions and some serious mistakes that need to be corrected. \n\nWhatever went down with your parents divorce is their business and you need to leave it alone. The one point you need to recognize is that your father is still sensitive about the entire ordeal and your family dynamics. It isn\u2019t about that your mother remarried a woman, but that she remarried at all and she is happy and has moved on. \n\nYour participation in that side of your family, while wonderful, and deep down your father is happy that you are happy, it stirs up his own pain that he is so unhappy. He may not even realize the truth in what I am explaining to you here. \n\nYour mistakes. Your father, despite his own unhappiness, he has tried to provide and be there for you which is something even your step-sister can see is a real value while you seem to take him  for granted. \n\nYou have made your relationship with your father all about your needs and happiness and have forgotten him completely. To feel like you can disrespect your father as you have and do is just sad and shows such little regard for him after all he has done for you. You have much to make up for if you don\u2019t want to just lose him completely. \n\nAlso, try putting your father first and with respect when you are with him because in his life, you are all he has. If he were happier, that could change. You are part of his happiness level, so be aware of this. \n\nTry including your step-sister into your life with your dad if possible since she does not have a male role model. You did not say much about this and it\u2019s just a thought. It may help bridge relationships all around in your complex family. \n\nTake a firm responsible hand in your family putting everyone\u2019s needs before your own and maybe you will see some happiness bloom all around which of course will be great for you too. That is after all the secret of life. Doing for others while reaping the rewards. Best of luck to all.", "INFO: Did you Moms get together due to an affair?", "NTA.  Your dad needs therapy to process his resentment.  It took several years for my step-daughter to call me Dad.  I came into her life at 10 and it started at 15.  We\u2019re divorced now, but at 20, she still calls me Dad and I will always be there for her.  It\u2019s a special honourific for those that love and support you unconditionally.  Many biological parents don\u2019t deserve the title, but it\u2019s up to each child who they feel most secure with.  A good parent is just happy that their child has another support in their lives.", "OP you're NTA, your father is, and everyone here telling you to be gentle and delicate with his feelings when nothing wrong has been done to him is also an asshole. he's a grown man, he's the parent, you're the child and still *a* child. he should just be happy that you're loved. he is responsible for sorting out whatever feelings and discomfort he has without expecting you to handhold him through it.you were right to be upset, he *is* homophobic, and so are most of these answers.", "NTA but you \u201cblew up\u201d because you have been \u201cletting it go\u201d (but not really letting it go because it built up inside until you exploded). Part of maturing and growing up is learning to calmly stand up for yourself when needed and not to bottle things up.", "NTA, and I\u2019m so proud of you for standing up for your bonus mom. You are not responsible for your dads feelings in anything. He\u2019s allowed to feel weird, but he needs to keep it to himself. Your mom may only be upset because all parents want their kids to have perfect relationships with the other. You\u2019re a good kid", "NTA. But your dad can compete with a stepdad, in fatherly duties, but not with a stepmom. If that makes any sense. Imagine if your mom had married another man, and you called him dad. I'm thinking he may feel the same way with you calling her wife mom.", "Nta in that it's your call. For him to say it's disrespectful is crap as it's nothing to do with him, it's your relationship with her not his. Sounds like he's lonely and jealous.", "NTA. You are blessed with 2 moms. Revel and grow in that love.", "NTA \nUnless your stepmom had a problem with it then it\u2019s totally fine. Seems like everyone is okay with it except your dad and that\u2019s your dads problem. Time for him to grow up. Also they\u2019re probably not upset with you about blowing up, probably just the situation that your dad created.", "Just because he doesn\u2019t like you calling her mom doesn\u2019t make him homophobic.\n\nSounds like you\u2019re taking an easy out so you don\u2019t have to take the time to try and understand where he\u2019s coming from.\n\nIf most people had a kid and they started calling their step parent Dad or Mom they\u2019d be pissed off and feeling hurt too.\nHow he feels is pretty reasonable.\n\nThen again I don\u2019t really understand your family dynamic or history.\n\nI\u2019m gonna say YTA, simply because you called your Dad (who loves you) homophobic, rather than taking the time to try and understand his feelings and running away from a hard conversation.", "NTA.  Your father was all the things you said and it needed to be aired.  You didn't say what response you got from your father, but at least he now knows what he needs to do.  It was wrong of him and he knew it, but kept on being an AH.  Let your mothers know it has nothing to do with them and thank your sister for her concern.", "Ask him if it would better if you started calling step mom 'dad'?", "That's not the question...\n\nThe wherein was not aita for calling her mum.\n\nThe question was aita for yelling. And the answer is, it is always best not to yell. As soon as you yell, you are giving the other person the high ground, you will sound out of control. Say what you want to say, but do so calmly.", "NTA.", "INFO: OP do you have any specific evidence not reported in the post for your dad being homophobic?\n\nResenting your ex's partner because you're homophobic is a whole different animal from garden variety jealousy.\n\nSpeaking as a queer person, it's really bad to cry homophobia when it's not happening. It downplays actual homophobia and is unfair to accuse someone of a specific type of bigotry they are not guilty of. So if you don't have evidence of homophobia I'd say you are T A specifically for bringing it in.\n\nIf you do have evidence of homophobia you are very much not T A for calling it out.", "Does he know you think he's a great parent?\n\nIt sounds like he's scared of being replaced, so the best response would have been to ask why he felt that way, not to have shouted at him and escalated things.\n\nThat said it's easy to say that outside the moment. I really think you need to have a calm sit down chat with him, and if you can't do that try a letter.\n\nAnd maybe consider apologising for calling him homophobic, unless you have further evidence of that.", "The solution is do what makes you happy without guilt bits not your guilt it\u2019s there\u2019s. Also u set a boundary with you dad.  I\u2019m proud of u. Forget everyone else\u2019s drama", "I read a bunch of the comments here and I wanted to pitch in where you would see it, so I'm hoping my comment makes it through the masses. \n\nI'm a mom with a big complicated blended family. There is me, my daughter, my ex (daughters father), my husband, my son (my husband's son) and my exs new wife. My daughter calls me mom, her new stepmother mama K, her dad and my husband are both dad and my husband is sometimes Daddy J. She picked the names. I'm OK with anything she wants to call anyone because it just means more people to love her. Her biological father is not ok with it but he and I had to sit down and have a conversation about how it has nothing to do with his or my pride or feeling on the matter. It hurts his feeling that she has a bonus dad and she calls him dad. I had to make him stop telling her it wasn't ok to tell her she can't call him dad. He can't control how our daughter feels and had to set aside his pride for her benefit.\n\nYou should sit down and talk to your moms. You Bio mom should be the liason between you and you dad with tough situations if you feel unheard. See if you can get your mom to talk to him and get him to set aside his pride to realise its just more love and support for you. Because that's what truly matters here, love and respect.\n\nBest of luck! And if you need an extra extra mom,  my dms are open.", "[deleted]", "I reckon you might want to respond to the original post or one of OPs comments so they get the notification, rather than me.", "This. Well said.", "Hey even if this is all correct, it\u2019s not a kids responsibility to be their parents safe space. Kids are supposed to be kids and adults are supposed to get professional help", "That being said, you should also be allowed to express your feelings and it's ok to be fed up sometimes (6 years, my god). Although you're an adult soon and should learn how to express your emotions, your father *is* an adult and should know how to do this. It's not your fault that he's insecure and taking it out on you.", "OK so screaming never helps but you're totally within your rights here. It's just not your dad's business what you call your stepmom. It's just not and you can have a boundary about that, where if he brings it up you leave.", "on 1 small plus side, at least it wasn\u2019t before age 10 when they started screwing w the kids like that\u2026.bc you start making a kid feel unwanted when they\u2019re young like maybe 5, and man that\u2019ll be one fucked up kid \u2639\ufe0f  \n(i say this with confidence bc i was 5 when i found out neither parent wanted me, and when they split up they were fighting even more then *bc neither wanted custody*(!!!) lol and it has for real fucked me up for yearssss)", "they divorced when OP was 10. mom remarried when OP was 12. it\u2019s been 5 years since the mom remarried & 7 since they\u2019ve been divorced\u2026 he needs to move tf on. that has nothing to do with OP. you\u2019re making up your own story with no facts or proof. you\u2019re weird.", "You're doing so much assuming here my head is spinning.
