You did the right thing. I work at a hospital, I have to do the same thing every day, you feel like a dick, but it\u2019s a safety issue and that draws the line for me, I\u2019ll always be safe rather than sorry in a situation like this\u2026 NTA", "NTA. First job is protect the children. Seriously. You did good and I hope you do it again when faced with a similar situation.", "NTA.\n\nyou trusted your intuition and i can\u2019t fault you for that. if she is genuinely a parent needing to pick up her child, surely she\u2019d be able to call the daycare to explain the situation so someone could come and let her in/bring her kid out to her. \nat worst, she\u2019s just as inconvenienced as she was before you arrived and at best, you didn\u2019t let someone with ill-intent harm kids.", "NTA: You are protecting your child and others children by enforcing a rule. If anything bad happened to a child and you had let that person in, you\u2019d feel responsible in some ways. Good rapid thinking !!", "99.9% chance everything is legit with this person. It takes a village for safety as dedicated security peeps can\u2019t be everywhere to prevent that 0.1% chance. The other person may be annoyed but deep down understands ultimately this protects everyone\u2019s kids.", "NTA, they have key fobs for the children\u2019s protection.", "NTA You don't know that person and there's a reason why there're security measures to follow", "NTA  the school probably has rules for this and a good reason. Unless you knew me personally I would be upset if you let me in. Just like an apt bldg don't let strangers in.\nI am editing to add that you should bring this up to the administration and ask them to reiterate the rules and ask them not to let people in unless they have a fob.", "NTA. Protect our children.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "NTA It\u2019s 2023. The world is a strange and dangerous place.", "NTA, and as a former preschool teacher, thank you! We have these security policies in place for a reason. In fact, it might be in your contract with the daycare that letting in other people could be grounds for terminating care for your family. I'm sure there was a staff person/buzzer they could have used if they were a legit person for the kid. We'd have their info from the parent and want to see a driver's license, etc, before allowing them into the building.", "NTA.  You did the right thing", "NTA although I probably would have explained and maybe offered to get someone to come out to her.", "Definitely NTA. Your training taught you well. She could have had children there, but if she did, I bet she wouldn\u2019t have any trouble asking you to send the daycare director or a teacher out so she could gain access. It sounds to me as if she didn\u2019t belong there and your strong and unmistakable reaction to her assertion that she was going to follow you in dissuaded her, and that\u2019s why she had left by the time you came out. Thank you; you\u2019re the type of parent I would want to be associated with my daycare.", "NTA. I'm sure other parents and employees would appreciate you, the only person who might be upset is the lady who didn't have the fob", "NTA\n\nYou made the right decision. That woman did not offer any proof that she was a parent of one of the children in the daycare. She could have been anyone! Yes, maybe she was just another parent, but what if she had ill intentions? Props to you for putting the safety of the kids in the daycare first.", "NTA and I admire what you did. Others, including myself, probably would have let her in to not appear \"weird\". Good job", "NTA especially so with the recent awfulness happening at schools. She should know better.", "NTA. \n\nI went to my kids' school the other day. You're supposed to call the office and get buzzed in. Someone was leaving and held the door for me to get in, I felt really uncomfortable with it. So even from the other side of the interaction, I'm still on your side.", "If she was truly responsible for a kid there, she should hope that other parents don't just let in random people hanging around outside the doors. \n\nIt would also mean that she should have been fully capable of calling the center, identifying herself, and asking to be let in. \n\nThere is no scenario in which she would have needed to follow you in to legitimately gain access to her child. \n\nI've read enough stories about crazy people trying to kidnap kids from daycare after they've rightfully lost access to the kid because of their craziness. NTA", "NTA.  And I assume that if she was a parent and forgot her key fob (which is probably common) then she could call the manager or other staff member who knew her to let her in.  You were not responsible for her entry and in point of fact should not be letting her \u201cpiggyback\u201d with you.\n\nFor all you know, the daycare could use the key fob swipes as a way to keep track of who accessed the building for security measures and to cross reference which children have been picked up.  By having her contact staff, they can log her entry.  By just letting her in, you risk an accounting issue at best and a security or safety issue at worst.\n\nBut maybe this comes from working at a government facility for decades and this is just ingrained into our behavior.", "If this person was a person of color, you'd be an AH and this would be on national news", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
