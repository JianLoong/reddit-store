Wanting to feel heard by your mother has NOTHING to do with being spoiled by her father. One of my biggest struggles as an adult is that I was never heard or listened to.

From your daughters perspective her siblings are more important than she is. That statement \"maybe she should live with her dad all the time\" that statement came from a place that you do not care for her which is what she thinks no matter how hard you ve tried try to understand that is what she thinks and believes, and you reinforced it BIG time with your response.\n\nDo not be suprised if your daughter cuts you out of her life completely 100% and I mean 100% no christmas, no birthdays, no graduation, no wedding nothing do not be suprised if she decides you are dead to her and treats you as such.\n\nYour responses and statements regarding your daughter speak volume, you might \"love\" her or think you do, but you clearly do not \"like\" her and you blame her father and her for who she is and you are taking that out on her.\n\nYou genuinly told your daughter and just stop for a moment and think about it because your the adult, you genuinly told her you do not want to see her anymore and she should stay with her father all the time, and your here asking us if you were an a hole to her.

The way you talk about your daughter, it sounds like the ONLY reason you even habe your daughter is because you hate your ex more then you love her. \n\nI mean, you treat her like shes a burden more then anything else.

Good parents do that.", "YTA, She is a 14 year old who was trying to talk to you about her day and you couldn't even be bothered to give her 5 minutes of attention (not all of it, all the time, as you suggest, she literally just wanted to tell you a story), and you basically told her to leave when she got angry that you can't listen to her. \n\nYou chose to be a parent to a pile of kids and you need to work out how to provide for all of them properly, to attend to each one's needs. Your daughter needs you to listen to her sometimes. If you cannot do it in that moment, you need to be a grown adult and communicate that. \"Sorry honey, I'm just a bit distracted right now, and I want to listen to your story, would it be ok if we sat down after dinner so I can focus on you?\"", "YTA - asking for your undivided attention is not her acting spoiled or expecting unreasonable things. I understand that she chose a bad time to tell you this story while you were distracted cooking and keeping an eye on the youngsters, but she might not understand this. It is natural that her dad can give her his full attention the second she wants/needs it and that you can\u2019t and you need to explain this to her.\n\nWhat makes you TA is how you handled the situation. The second she started telling you the story you should\u2019ve told her \u201cHey sweetie. I really want to hear your story but right now is not a good time. I will have all the time to listen to you after I put the kids to bed, I promise.\u201d Instead you started fighting with her for sharing her feelings and agreed that she should go live somewhere else because she got angry that you weren\u2019t listening, which she had a right to be.\n\nETA: after reading your comments I see she\u2019s only with you 2 days a month. That just means it\u2019s even MORE important that you make time for just you and her to hang out! She seems like all she wants to do is just TALK to you without getting interrupted so give her a chance to do that! It sounds like that\u2019d improve your relationship a lot. If just sitting down and talking feels too stiff/forced for the two of you then do something together at the same time. Play a game, do some art/crafts (my 14 y/o cousin loves making her own earrings from one of those DIY sets), bake a cake, go for a walk (if you have someone to watch the other kids). It can be anything, as long as it\u2019s something you both enjoy doing. If those small hangouts go well you can suggest meeting up one afternoon a month to go out and do something together. I understand that you might not have the money for expensive gifts/outings but that\u2019s not what matters. What matters is that you give her of the time you do have and that you do small things to show her that you take an interest in her. It can be as small as asking her how that math test she had coming up last time went. That shows her that you listen and remember the things she tells you. Or buying her that cute keychain with a dog on it you saw at dollar store, because you know she loves dogs. Gestures and gift with thought and sentiment behind them are often more valued than the expensive or flashy ones.", "YTA. People in the comments are giving you very clear and consistent reasons that you're doing a bad job as a parent and you're just saying the same things trying to blame your daughter for \"her choices.\" The real problem here is very clear, and it's that you're not willing to put in any effort in being a mother to your eldest daughter.\n\nAs a person who was also neglected by my parents in favor of my brother, I hope that your daughter has a good therapist and that she removes your toxicity from her life as soon as possible.", "YTA.

Of course a 14 year old is going to scream.

If you got shared custody when she was younger, then telling her to stay with her father from now on implies that you are getting rid of her because of her behavior, and that she is disposable.

That gives you, on average, 28 days to split between your other children. As a result, Alec and Max get about fourteen days each of your attention- at least, of the attention you feel able to devote to your children.\n\nThen we come to the two days when you have Harlow. In your mind, you have to split this time between all three kids equally. This means that each child gets two-thirds of a day: 2/3 of a day times three kids equals six thirds, or two days. Are you with me so far?\n\nWhen it just comes to these two days, this looks fair, but that ignores the rest of the month. When you bring that into the equation, you see that Max and Alec each get fourteen-and-two-thirds days of your attention, and Harlow gets two-thirds- not even a full day of your attention. There is nothing equal there, to say nothing about equitability.\n\nSo Harlow goes to your home for two days a month, but only gets your attention for a third of that time. This stings for her, because she knows your other kids get almost fifteen days apiece to themselves. But she still tries to keep you in the loop: to cram an entire month's worth of stories and catching up into the two-thirds of a day she's allotted. Maybe she runs over her time here and there, because she's so excited to see you, for the brief time you can spare. And instead of being delighted that your teenage daughter wants to keep you involved in her life, you ignore her and then tell her she might as well not come over anymore.\n\nThis has nothing to do with how her father treats her, though I suspect you're angry at, or jealous of, him, and since you can't harass him your daughter becomes the target of these feelings. Her relationship with him is separate from her relationship with you. The issue is that she wants her mother to take interest, to be involved in her life. And you're telling her that unless she's willing to cede most of the limited time she has with you, she's selfish and not worth spending time on.\n\nI'm glad she does have a father who can give her undivided attention, to hopefully offset the message you're sending her: that she's not worth the energy. If having to feign interest is so exhausting that you'd rather never see your daughter, then go on behaving as you are, because I can guarantee she won't keep setting herself up for failure like this. If, however, you actually care about being present in your daughter's life, then do what you have to do to be present during her visits. If that means your sons get slightly less attention for two days, they'll still have the rest of the month to recover. Your daughter has made due with far less for far too long, and will need some action on your part to convince her you give even one singular damn about her.", "Seriously, OP? You are actually blaming your 14 yr old child for exhibiting normal 14 yr old behaviors. Definitely YTA.", "Part of being polite is actually listening to someone when they are speaking to you.

It was something about the father being a \u201cDisney dad\u201d but you can\u2019t see the rest because she removed it. OP: you have your daughter two days a month. Your other children (presumably) you have the other 28-29 days and they get the attention. Why is it unreasonable for her to think you\u2019re listening to her talk while making dinner? Or listening to her at all. \n\nI was very private, even as a child. When I was 6, when I was 14, when I was 28, I didn\u2019t really talk to my mom about anything other than academics. It drove her insane. My sister is the open sister and gave her the intimacy she craved. And my mother and father were together so I got plenty of undivided attention. I think you should consider yourself lucky that your child, at any age, wants to share her life with you. My mom BEGGED me to share things, and I just couldn\u2019t. And my mother didn\u2019t treat me like I was a horrible child, even though it hurt her. Up until she died, she never tried to make me feel less than my sister because I\u2019m not as open. \n\nYou are a bad mom. And as I said in my own YTA comment, you will be back on Reddit here in a few years crying because your \u201cungrateful\u201d daughter doesn\u2019t want you to meet her SO. Or come to family holidays. Or invite you to her wedding. Or be involved with her kids. You made your bed.", "Replying to OP's deleted comment that said \"Oh please. What 14yo girl wouldn't choose living with the fun Disney parent over their mom?\"\n\nNews for you, OP. If she is living with him 28 days out of 30, he is doing ALL the heavy lifting. I promise it's not all sunshine and roses and disney dad over there. He is disciplining her, dealing with those teenage hormones and everything that's involved in raising a teenager. Of anyone was perfectly set up to be a Disney parent, it would be you. But you are so resentful about your ex that YOU are ruining your relationshipnwoth your daughter.\n\nYou've said that she talks \"ALL THE TIME.\" No shit. She is trying to fit in a month worth of relationship into 2 days. Pay attention to her. If you can't because you have to make dinner or help another kid, USE YOUR BIG GIRL WORDS.\n\nThere is so mich more I want to say but I'm so mad for your daughter, I'll say stuff that would get me banned.", "This thread finally trickled to the truth. So much resentment. OP is in the middle of a teenage spat with her teenager. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be my friend?! Well, I don\u2019t want to be yours!!\u201d\n\nYTA, OP. It sounds like your daughter feels replaced. You have new kids from a new man. And when she does what a lot of kids who feel rejected do, withdraw, you push her away even more. She does need more attention. She deserves it, even. Because that\u2019s a really hard situation for a kid to be in and you should expect for there to be a transition phase. So go on and keep arguing with everyone here telling you YTA but don\u2019t be surprised when your daughter eventually says it.", "No wonder they got divorced, I wonder why her daughter doesn't want to spend 50/50 custody....", "Even if OP were to spend the entirety of those two days giving all of her attention to the eldest, she is still only getting attention from mom for 6% of the month. If OP splits her attention equally between all three kids on those two days, now the eldest only gets 2% of her mom's time. \n\nI get that OP can't completely ignore her other two kids for those two days, but her priority should be on the eldest since she will always be at a deficit. But OP isn't looking for equity. She is looking for an excuse to write off her daughter all together.", "More like a whole month \ud83d\ude36\u200d\ud83c\udf2b\ufe0f", "Or even be polite and say \"I'm busy with these things right now, can we talk when I'm done cooking?\" My son is with me 100% of the time and very very chatty. I've definitely had to work on not snapping when he repeatedly talks to me while I'm trying to do something. Now I just will tell him what I'm doing and that I'd love to hear what he has to say, but can it wait 5 minutes.", ">You are throwing a temper tantrum over your kid wanting to be with her dad\n\nNo, it's actually worse than that. She is throwing a temper tantrum because, get this, she has to *actually parent/spend time/pay attention AND give a shit about her 14 year old.* And for only 2 (two, 1+1) days OUT OF A MONTH! The horror!"]}
