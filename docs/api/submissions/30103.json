She\u2019s bitter af towards the dad and says it\u2019s her daughters fault for getting no one on one time.

If you couldn\u2019t listen to her story you could\u2019ve said give me a few minutes etc,. Screaming at a 14 yo doesn\u2019t work and telling her that she should stay with her dad from now on reinforces that in contrast to your title it doesn\u2019t sound like you treat all of your kids equally; it sounds like you treat your teen worst.", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t know, maybe you could have been an adult and said something like \u201cHey, I really want to hear about this, Harlow, but I can\u2019t give it my full attention while making dinner and helping with homework, so can you tell me at dinner?\u201d\n\nYou are an adult. So maybe you could model adult good manners instead of ignoring her and making her feel unwanted and secondary in her home. And then blowing up at her.\n\nYou have a teenager who actually wants to talk to you about her day/life and you can\u2019t even handle making time for that in a reasonable way? This was a big parenting fail on your part.", "Yta. You're not handling the situation in the right way. Just explain it to her.", "YTA for punishing your child for choosing to live with her dad.", "YTA.\n\nYou thought you were multitasking. Multitasking is actually impossible, and what you showed both Harlow and Alec is that their needs are not your main focus. You are clearly a busy person but if your kids are resenting your split attention, you need to do better. For example, helping with Alec\u2019s homework could have happened before you started cooking or after dinner. Harlow could have helped with meal prep while you two talked about her day. Heck, Harlow could have helped Alec while you cooked in peace and got some time to yourself. Allocate your resources better!\n\nThen you got mad at Harlow for pointing out your lack of attention (and yes, she should not have screamed at you but she\u2019s a literal child) and basically told her that you don\u2019t care if she stops visitation.", "YTA - but the problem is she wasn\u2019t getting ANY of your attention.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you don't even make the time to LISTEN To her? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She threatened that she will stay with her dad from now on if I keep being like this a\" ..luckily, she has ONE parent who is not an AHand  cares enough to spend time with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe itIS better to go stay with her dad, he is interested in her and does not push her aside.", "YTA. Wanting to feel heard by your mother has NOTHING to do with being spoiled by her father. One of my biggest struggles as an adult is that I was never heard or listened to. The fact she got angry is because she\u2019s hurt, she values you\u2019re love and attention yet you told her you\u2019re not against her leaving. She was wanting to feel loved and twice you failed at showing her that. Also, her father needs to stay tf out, he has no business texting you anything.", "YTA - there isn\u2019t some formula one can do to figure out how much time to spend with each kid. \n\nBut right now you have a kid who clearly needs your attention, and you\u2019re ignoring them. That makes you an AH.", "YTA your handling of this situaiton if completely off, and your not thinking of it from your daughters perspective at all.  \n\n\nHer siblings get your every day of the month, she gets to spend time with you 2 days of the month, and you blame her for that and her father. \"Who would not want to live with the disney parent\", who wants to have to choose between their parents, who wants to only see their mom 2 days a month or their father 2 days a month who wants that?  \n\n\nYour not dividing your time equally because you do not see them equally or speak to them equally. From your daughters perspective her siblings are more important than she is. That statement \"maybe she should live with her dad all the time\" that statement came from a place that you do not care for her which is what she thinks no matter how hard you ve tried try to understand that is what she thinks and believes, and you reinforced it BIG time with your response.  \n\n\nDo not be suprised if your daughter cuts you out of her life completely 100% and I mean 100% no christmas, no birthdays, no graduation, no wedding nothing do not be suprised if she decides you are dead to her and treats you as such.\n\nYour responses and statements regarding your daughter speak volume, you might \"love\" her or think you do, but you clearly do not \"like\" her and you blame her father and her for who she is and you are taking that out on her.  \n\n\nYou genuinly told your daughter and just stop for a moment and think about it because your the adult, you genuinly told her you do not want to see her anymore and she should stay with her father all the time, and your here asking us if you were an a hole to her. Is it any wander when thats the message you sent out there for her she went to her room crying in pain and hurt and is angry at you now.  \n\n\nTo her you chose your new family over her, to her you ignore her when she is there, to her you told her you dont want her in your life anymore and to just stay with her father all the time.  \n\n\nYour the adult not her you should be the one showing empathy and trying to think about it from her perspective.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems like you have resentment she chose to live with her dad over you.", "NTA.\n\nHarlow's a teenager now.

His child is being emotionally neglected by her mother and then told it doesn\u2019t matter if she stops visitation. This girl is 14 years old her dad absolutely has a right to stick up for his daughter who is not being treated right. If the shoes were switched and the dad was ignoring her and calling her a spoiled brat telling her to not come anymore because she wanted one on one time without his new kids and for him to just listen to her and the mom spoke up it would be no issue.

Sounds like you think everything your daughter does is spoiled and rotten. It\u2019s normal for people to want their mom to remember something they just said to them, it\u2019s normal for people to want their parents to take interest in them, it\u2019s normal to desire one on one time.

Good luck on ever talking to your kid again after 18.

You can\u2019t listen to her talk about everything you\u2019ve missed out on the other 28 days you don\u2019t have to be a mom to her? You can\u2019t make it a point to have one on one time with her FOR TWO FUCKING DAYS?!?! your other kids have you the rest of the month undivided attention but you can\u2019t even give your daughter two days of that.

That\u2019s ludicrous", "Of course she gets my attention but my point is she can't expect more attention and this is a result of her choice.\n\nI don't like the way he is raising her. He is making her a spoiled entitled child and I worry about her future", "She clearly doesn\u2019t. You hate your kid and it\u2019s so obvious. She absolutely can expect more attention. She sees you two days a month you SHOULD be showering her with attention in those two days. Your husband should make sure you get to spend those two days with her. Babysitters grandparents. A good mother would use all resources to prioritize a kid they only see two days a month. But then again you aren\u2019t. Did it ever cross your mind that your daughter only wanting to see you two days a month is a result of you being a terrible mother? 14 year old girls don\u2019t want to only spend two days a month with their mom for no reason. You\u2019re not going to convince anyone here she\u2019s the problem and not you"]}
