I\u2019m used to her childish behaviour but last week she took it way too far. I\u2019ve been vegan for 3 years. It\u2019s a moral thing and ever since going vegan I\u2019ve had a repulsion to meat, especially steaks. I get really nauseous by the sight of meat and the texture of the bones and veins and ughhh thinking about it is making my skin crawl.\nWell Jamie knows this fact well and on my birthday I came back from the bathroom during break and I see my bag has been left open and a whole steak, covered in juice and blood but wrapped in a thin piece of paper was sitting on top of my books in my bag. It smelled horrible and the juice was all over my library books and my hands and I started gagging and when I went to the bathroom to get tissue I could hear Jamie and her friends laughing. I was absolutely outraged, despite being used to her dim witted behaviour. \nWhen I went home I was reminded by my sister who\u2019s also in a few of my classes that videos of her writing on the bathroom walls, taking pictures of teachers and doing all sorts of idiotic stuff in school were on her instagram highlights on her private account, which she was on. I asked her to send me the videos and in a really impulsive moment I sent them all (and the steak story) anonymously to my school principal via email. \nTo make a long story short, she was not happy and Jamie got suspended and might be expelled. Nobody knows who did it but my close friends know it was me, they think it was out of character for me but also that it was a shitty thing to do.

Same for any school books from classes you had to carry around. The backpack also needs to be washed, if not replaced, as well; some backpacks can't be washed in a machine, and getting in the inside of a backpack to clean properly can be ridiculously difficult. \n\nBooks aren't cheap, so we're probably looking at $10-20/book, so the 'harmless' prank could be $100+ of damages. And trust me: someone who gets away with this crap will think they can do it again, or do worse, and get away with it. You're protecting yourself (or someone else!) from a worse situation. And by reporting it BEFORE she's an adult, she has a better chance of getting past it. Behavior at 16 can be written off at 20 as 'something stupid I did as a kid and learned from'; that same thing at 18+, when you're legally an adult, can become a criminal record keeping you from a LOT of jobs.

That\u2019s entirely justified imo. Especially as all you did was send proof of her actions; she\u2019s the one who committed vandalism etc. I was badly bullied in school and the girls put a gravy-covered sausage in my lunchbox when I went to the toilet. I was almost sick when I touched it and I couldn\u2019t eat the rest of my lunch.

You cannot always appeal to an upper level of authority, or some such kind of justice.  Sometimes you have to be able to just tolerate it; or I LOVE IT when the bully gets upset bc I act as if that person is invisible.\n\nThere are many ways to address bullying behavior.

We both just laughed. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Good for you! FAFO, bullies.", "NTA. I despise the vegan idea, but this was NOT harmless in any way.

It damaged library books and hurt you. \n\nI am not against sending the videos of Jamie vandalizing the school. 1) She shouldn't be vandalizing the school, disrespecting teachers, or doing other inappropriate things. 2) Posting her illegal activities online is her idiotic move. 3) You probably saved the school money fixing all the future vandalism she is hopefully now not going to be doing.\n\nHowever, even if you hadn't done that, I hope you would report her \"prank\" to the principal because 1) she and not you should pay for the damaged library books 2) bullying is not okay and you deserve to feel safe at school. \n\nNTA.

If this bully is doing stuff like that to you , I imagine she is hurting others with her \u201cpranks.\u201d  Others will likely not take it as well as you.

She may even get to make a fresh start with people who don\u2019t know what\u2019s she\u2019s done and new friends who will be better influences. Maybe she won\u2019t make use of this opportunity.
