I\u2019d see the texts conversations and it\u2019s clear that AP would be insanely rude and crazy. They would often block one another. \n\nDuring Covid I stayed with a friend who\u2019s mom became like a mom to me. When I left, tears were shed from both me and her. \nDuring Mother\u2019s Day, I thanked AN, my grandma and my friends mom for stepping up in my moms place and showing me love (my mom is dead).\n\nAP messaged me nasty things about both me, AN, and my partner (now my ex). I asked why she\u2019s saying these things and she said it was because I didn\u2019t thank her in my post. Mind you, I only spoke to AP maybe 1 time every year and saw her maybe once every 3 years. She did no stepping up at all. She never reached out once prior to this. \n\nSo I told her that\u2019s why she wasn\u2019t mentioned. And SHE WENT OFF. \n\n\nShe proceeded to show me screenshots of my mother talking about ending her life (which is how my mom actually died), and called me a waste of air because I didnt have a real career or good money when I was 20. She called my cousins the R word (they\u2019re autistic) and claimed AN was trying to \u201cbuy my love\u201d by stepping up when I needed it since my dad didn\u2019t and my mom was dead . Some insanely vile stuff.\n \n\nSo I told her she\u2019s dead to me. And to never reach out or speak to me again. \n\nAnd I said, \u201cwho sends a grieving family member screenshots of their mom saying those things right before committing? And the R word in 2021? And bashing AN, who IS like a mom to me??\u201d And that made her go ballistic.\n\nThis was on messenger, and after a while of her spamming me, I just put \u201ccongratulations\u201d which I didn\u2019t know would send a screen full of confetti. I thought that was HILARIOUS cause it was 100% unknown to me that messenger did that automatically.\nSo anytime AP messaged me during her rage, I just replied with confetti filled \u201ccongratulations\u201d until she blocked me\n\nWe haven\u2019t spoken since. She\u2019s recently unblocked me to show off her beach vacations (flexing her money which she bashed me for being poor in my 20s). I haven\u2019t blocked her cause imo whoever does the blocking means they give up/lose the argument lol\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: To clarify, when I mentioned whoever blocks loses the argument; I meant in this situation specifically. She\u2019s an alcoholic narcissist who never gets put in her place by anyone. And I know if I blocked her, she\u2019d think \u201cshe won\u201d and get satisfaction out of that. I don\u2019t want her to get satisfaction from that conversation \n\nAlso, I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m TA because I\u2019ve been told by many that I went way too far and have received gasps and looks around the room when I updated AN and her kids (my adult cousins) on the matter as if I was in the wrong", "created_utc": 1697526803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179skjl/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_shes_dead_to_me/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
