We've never had serious issues before and have always confided in each other about any issues we've had.\n\nSix months ago Lisa asked me out for dinner to a new tapas place. I'm Spanish, I miss tapas greatly, so I was excited to go. After we were done she apologetically told me she forgot her wallet - no issue, it happens, I covered the bill, which was massive (why are tapas only cheap in Spain?). She never paid me back. This has happened several times since then. I've tried asking her if she has money troubles but she only laughed uproariously. She'd then tell me she would wire me the money as soon as she got home. She never did.\n\nYesterday we went to the same tapas place with some more friends. On the way there I was talking to a friend of ours about how we had gone to the restaurant before, how delicious it was. I then said \"oh yeah that's when Lisa forgot her wallet\" and then added, mostly joking \"and she never paid me back\". I genuinely wasn't trying to start anything but I can't deny I was miffed. I had talked to her about the money several times before but had never gotten anything back apart from \"omg I'm so sorry I'll transfer it as soon as I get home, I'm really sorry!!\".\n\nWell Lisa obviously overheard and although she looked kinda pissed she said \"oh gosh yes that's true I keep meaning to transfer it to you. How about this, I'll cover your bill tonight?\" I was super happy about this and accepted gratefully.\nWe then got to the restaurant and before we went in, some of us were smoking outside and I saw inside her bag which was weirdly empty. I then asked her if she had her wallet with her. She dismissed me laughing and said \"of course I do\". I then told her \"look I just saw your bag, I don't think your wallet is in there and frankly, I'm not setting a foot inside this restaurant before you show us you brought it.\"\n\nGotta admit, I was really angry at that point because it really felt like she was going to use me again, since I was her closest friend there. Everyone else didn't understand the context and just looked at me weird and told me to calm down.\nWell long story short: we fought and it turned out she really hadn't brought it. I yelled at her that this was the fifth time in six months and that I was done paying for her only to never get my money back. I then went home.\n\nI feel guilty but also kind of happy that I stood up for himself. On the other hand, Lisa is super hurt by the whole thing, keeps saying I humiliated her and that she never did it purposefully. When I asked her how it's possible this has never happened in 12 years of friendship but has now happened five times in six months, she had no answer. We are speaking but things are really tense and uncomfortable.", "created_utc": 1667402178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk7xm2/aita_for_humiliating_my_friend/", "score": 284, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially since you've tried to work it out in private. Besides, at this point you shouldn't even need to bring your wallet to shoot your friend some money to get them back for something, with zelle and venmo and stuff.

They usually return the favor which is the great thing about friends. We\u2019re happy to treat each other once in a while, but with in reason. There\u2019s a difference between treating a friend & being taken advantage of. Lisa was definitely taking advantage of you. Sounds like she is having money issues but is too prideful to admit it. She should\u2019ve been up front with you instead of laughing off legitimate questions. You had enough and stood up for yourself. Lisa needs to solve her own issues because her issues are not your problem", "NTA at all. How *could* you be? She used you for a free night out 5 times already and was about to do it again.

Yeah humiliation sucks, but she brought it on herself. There\u2019s only so much a body can take, and she pushed you to your limit.", "NTA:  This definitely appears to be a pattern for her.  Maybe you could have brought this up in a different place/time, but when she offered to cover you that night and hadn't brought her wallet yet again, it seems perfectly reasonable to just call it done.", "NTA! She\u2019s stealing from you, and you caught her as she was about to do it again.

If you deicde to treat it is than your choice. At the moment you unknowingly treating Lisa.\n\nI have to say the not having the wallet thing is a bit difficult to comment on, I have seen people pay amounts on their phone, albeit she seems to have admitted that she didnt have her wallet ( how was she planning to pay for you both that evening???).\n\nThere is obviously some issue with her, I am unsure why she doesn't want to share it with you.

She has money problems and wants you to keep paying for her nights out.  NTA\n\nMake sure you tell your other friends about what's going on.

I can pay all my bills with just my cellphone nowadays, the \"I didn't bring my wallet\" excuse just doesn't work anymore.
