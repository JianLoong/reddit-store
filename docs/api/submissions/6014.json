You were very accommodating. She can wear something formal or stay home. Her threat to \"not recognize your marriage\" and still \"view you as single\" is just a desperate attention grab.\n\nThis isn't about casual dress.

Or 2) Let her own this outfit.  You're young enough to still do crazy things, and still be perfectly confident in it.  Let her be the odd one out.  Bring the dress on the backend so that if she wants to change into it, she can.

Are there any issues between her and your fianc\u00e9? Is she still wishing you and her father were together, especially if it was recent?

You will need to be in their favor when they rule the world.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nThe poor kid is probably having feelings about you getting married, and you telling her basically \"well don't come, I don't care \" is not helping. Being that age is hard enough. \n\nYour child is more important than a wedding aesthetic.", "This isn't an asshole question. You have a reasonable request but your daughter is 12. She (I'm going to assume pronouns from yours but is she/her the right pronoun expression right now?) has very few things she has control of at a time when her emotions are all novel and very powerful. You're getting married and since she has been unwilling and resistant to the planning process, I suspect she's not super excited about your marriage. So she's digging in her heels and attempting to exercise the tiny amount of control over her life that she feels she has - over her immediate body and clothing.\n\nThreatening to cut her out of the wedding if she doesn't conform is only going to make her feel more unhappy and more powerless in this situation - and more desperate to cling to any method of asserting herself and expressing her feelings. Speaking as a (former) goth teenager you need to not die on this hill. You can express your feelings to her but if your feelings are that she needs to look a certain way to belong in your life/wedding - set it that idea on fire and let it go. Because that's what she, in her pre-teen angst, is hearing. She is hearing that you are getting married and she's only welcome in your new life if she looks nice and is obedient.\n\nLet her wear whatever dumb costume she wants to wear. Take family wedding pictures. Hang them on the wall. Act as if she looks totally normal and in a few years she's going to groan and feel really dumb over those pictures. But she'll also feel like she was loved and part of your life when you were changing both your lives dramatically. There is a small but very real possibility that if you stop fighting her on this she won't need to rebel so much and then you two can go shopping for a more formal (but probably still alternative) outfit that works as a compromise for you both.", "YTA.\n\nIf you can't see your kid is looking for reasons to be pissed at you...\n\nShe's not putting herself or anybody else in danger by wearing what she wants so let her do it.", "Yes,\n\nyou are not respecting her, you want your daughter to validate your marriage, let her be.\n\nYou won\u2019t respect her, you\u2019ll have bigger issue down the line.", "YTA Why does it make you happy to know your daughter will be feeling miserable at your wedding?

She is trying to put her foot down and find some regularity, assurance that she isn\u2019t being caught up in someone else\u2019s storm.
