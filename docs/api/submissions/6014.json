It's odd to me how you expect her to process emotions in a more mature way than deciding she wants to feel comfortable in her clothing. It's not a rebellion. Her entire world is changing, her mom is getting married, her family dynamic is changing. If clothes are the one thing that can make her feel okay during such a life changing moment, let her have it. OP would look like the best mom down the line for letting her daughter feel okay. She can learn dress attire to other people's weddings, events, in life.\n\nEDIT 2: Last edit to this, OP says her fianc\u00e9 is fine with it. That'd be a beautiful way for her daughter to grow a strong bond with him! He seems to even see this is more than just appearances/cares more about her presence than OP.

Or 2) Let her own this outfit.  You're young enough to still do crazy things, and still be perfectly confident in it.  Let her be the odd one out.  Bring the dress on the backend so that if she wants to change into it, she can.

Are there any issues between her and your fianc\u00e9? Is she still wishing you and her father were together, especially if it was recent?

You will need to be in their favor when they rule the world.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nThe poor kid is probably having feelings about you getting married, and you telling her basically \"well don't come, I don't care \" is not helping. Being that age is hard enough. \n\nYour child is more important than a wedding aesthetic.", "This isn't an asshole question. You have a reasonable request but your daughter is 12. She (I'm going to assume pronouns from yours but is she/her the right pronoun expression right now?) has very few things she has control of at a time when her emotions are all novel and very powerful. You're getting married and since she has been unwilling and resistant to the planning process, I suspect she's not super excited about your marriage. So she's digging in her heels and attempting to exercise the tiny amount of control over her life that she feels she has - over her immediate body and clothing.\n\nThreatening to cut her out of the wedding if she doesn't conform is only going to make her feel more unhappy and more powerless in this situation - and more desperate to cling to any method of asserting herself and expressing her feelings. Speaking as a (former) goth teenager you need to not die on this hill. You can express your feelings to her but if your feelings are that she needs to look a certain way to belong in your life/wedding - set it that idea on fire and let it go. Because that's what she, in her pre-teen angst, is hearing. She is hearing that you are getting married and she's only welcome in your new life if she looks nice and is obedient.\n\nLet her wear whatever dumb costume she wants to wear. Take family wedding pictures. Hang them on the wall. Act as if she looks totally normal and in a few years she's going to groan and feel really dumb over those pictures. But she'll also feel like she was loved and part of your life when you were changing both your lives dramatically. There is a small but very real possibility that if you stop fighting her on this she won't need to rebel so much and then you two can go shopping for a more formal (but probably still alternative) outfit that works as a compromise for you both.", "YTA.\n\nIf you can't see your kid is looking for reasons to be pissed at you...\n\nShe's not putting herself or anybody else in danger by wearing what she wants so let her do it.", "Yes,\n\nyou are not respecting her, you want your daughter to validate your marriage, let her be.\n\nYou won\u2019t respect her, you\u2019ll have bigger issue down the line.", "YTA Why does it make you happy to know your daughter will be feeling miserable at your wedding?

She kept the lovely lavender dress on for the ceremony and photos, and then immediately threw on an LSU football jersey for the eating/dancing/socializing and tied her dress up so it wasn't floor length. Honestly, that kid was the life of the party and killed it on the dance floor.\n\nThere's middle ground for both parents and kids at weddings. For OP's case, why not find a nice black skirt/slacks that work with the heels, a good formal shirt for ceremony and photos, and then let the kid get comfy? Throw on a t-shirt and let her be her. Less than formal kid who is having fun is much nicer that a well-dressed angsty teen in the corner.", "She is YTA. I would not prohibit her from wearing it if she reall insists, but I would sit her down and have a serious talk. \n\nMaybe kid is not aware of what wearing this outfit could lead to. She needs to be able to handle evil looks, smirks, rolleyes, even unpleasant jokes or negative comments directly to her face. \nIt could easily end up with her in tears.

OP immediately saying, \"Then don't come.\" is also ... interesting.\n\nThat sounds like her true goal - there's something about the marriage that is upsetting the daughter. It could be the fiance. It could be that she no longer has mom to herself/does not feel like a priority. It could be other changes coming in the wake of the wedding that haven't been mentioned. But something about the wedding is upsetting her.\n\nI really think you need to work through this with her.", "My mother in law wore, and I quote \"her best jeans.\" My mother did NOT wear her usual baseball cap.

Who is hurting her? And why this person has the excuse to hurt her? \n\nI am nobody to judge but my feelings say that if this mother is hurting because her daughter doesn't want to follow the dress code and not because the kid is in pain from the wedding and the change in their lives then mother deserves to be hurted and YTA.", "This here was the answer I was scrolling for or would have put myself.

This girl will feel super lame later, but it will be her doing. Plus mom gets to show her that the person matters not the clothes. If I were the mother I would find great fun in this. I\u2019m weird though.", "I totally agree with you. Let the 12 year old wear her chosen outfit. (At least she's wearing a skirt.)

Adults can just use power over minors to get their way.

Again, this is a LIFE lesson between parent/child, not about the girls clothes, or someone's casual wedding where they didn't care how others dress.

You making this far to deep than it is; Op daughter being disrespectful period thinking she rule over, she can wear a formal outfit for one day", "I'm a Vancouver Canucks fan, and I would accept my daughter wearing a Calgary Flames jersey if it meant she would be at any event in my life. Only Canadians will understand the significance of this.\n\nOP - Somewhere deep down, do you see this marriage as a new start or chance for a life that you could have had if you didn't get pregnant young? And now you won't let anything blemish this dreamland vision of yours for a restart, even if it means sacrificing your relationship with your 12 year old child - a literal child - for your new partner and potential family? YTA.", "Yeah that completely strict adherence to dress rules comes from Old Classism, if you couldn\u2019t afford the clothes it was easy to keep you out without discriminating directly", "Did you read there's MONTHS leading to this event? She could've spent the time talking with her daughter, making compromises such as \"what if you changed after the ceremony?\" , or even letting her daughter voice her feelings? Instead OP just put a wedge in their relationship by saying \"If you don't dress how I want, don't be there\" \n\nThis is still a child. She isn't going to be a full mature woman, understanding her mothers important day. You're seeing this differently, I respect it. But I don't think I'm making it deep. Kids 99% always have a meaning behind them. Read the comments, you'll see people saying they pulled this same shit when their parent was getting married.", "It\u2019s almost like a normal tween behaviour can be shown in a matter of emotional importance to get attention?", "Yeah, but it's the fact that her mom is getting married. I'd say there's very few 12yr olds who are going to have uncomplicated feelings about that. \n\nMy dad remarried when I was about 30, and my brothers were 28 and 20. We went, behaved and dressed appropriately. Had a pretty good time, then drank ourselves into oblivion and spent an hour at about 3am crying on each other's shoulders. \n\nYes lots of 12yr olds push boundaries about clothes. But a 12yr old making this big a deal about what they wear at their own mother's wedding? Maybe you can't say for sure that's what's behind the clothes thing.\n\nBut you should absolutely consider it and at least ask the question before telling your possibly suffering 12yr old to just not come to your wedding.", "Surely she will want sharks with freaking laser beams on their heads.", "No you\u2019re wrong about this. The daughter will never, ever look back and think \u201cWow mom i\u2019m so glad you forced me to wear what you wanted I look so good in those pictures.\u201d This event (her mom marrying someone that\u2019s not her dad) is big and this decision is very small in comparison. OP should let her child embarrass herself with her clothing choice and let her learn with some grace. If your child hates you and the lack of respect you show them, you won\u2019t get any parenting done at all.", "trust me, she wont see this as a lesson in parenting. she will see this as her mother not letting her be her true self.", "Yeh a football shirt isn't appropriate, but a plainer tshirt could work.\n\nI feel there's more to this though, at 12 I knew how to dress appropriately for a wedding.", "If a t-shirt ruins your wedding day, seek therapy.\n\nIn what way do you think she's going to act in a skirt and sandals?", "No I don't expect a 12 year old to be an adult. But they have to learn there are consequences to her actions. The mother is the parent, she is the authority, the child has to 'respect her authority' (imagine cartman saying that). It may have to do with more, but that's the whole point, the mother is in charge, not the child.", "Oh come on. You don't really think the daughter wants to dress inappropriately because she's against dressing up in general do you? This isn't about the outfit, it's the kid's immature way of trying to exert some form of personal autonomy in a situation where major life changes are coming that she has no control or power over.    \n\n\nEven if it is about the dressing up, there are plenty of other occasions where this lesson can be taught without telling your own daughter she's not allowed to come to your wedding.", "You know what's a great way to teach a 12 year old to dress appropriately for the occasion? Letting them show up to something low-stakes (like her own mother's wedding, verses someone else's wedding or a funeral) dressed inappropriately. Living through mistakes is a better teacher than discipline ever can be. This is especially true if she's not doing it because she doesn't understand, but because she wants attention or is upset by the wedding-- sometimes the lesson kids learn from parents' discipline is not the one the parent intended. \"Dress appropriately or you can't go,\" is something the teaches a message when the event is something the child really wants to go, which we don't know for certain is the case here. OP should want her daughter there, though-- so refusing to let her go is just going to teach her appearances are more important to her mother than her, which is not the lesson OP or you intend.\n\nIMO there are two possibilities here:  \n1) OP's daughter is doing this to act out for attention because she's having complex feelings about her mom remarrying. If so, not letting her attend is going to harm the relationship between OP and her daughter. Ignoring the misdressing may be the best way to handle it without torpedoing the relationship-- shame might get to her, or the negative attention might make her feel good, but Mom should stand strong and just ignore it. If the reaction she wants is her mother's, don't fight, don't give her that \"any attention is good attention\".   \n2) The daughter actually doesn't understand what's appropriate, but is willing to die on the hill. If so, the embarrassment of actually showing up like that may be the best teacher. OP can arrange her to have an appropriate dress if her daughter realizes this partway through the wedding and wants to change.", " Ut she doesn\u2019t say that. She\u2019s not talking about grandpa\u2019s funeral or cousin\u2019s wedding but her own wedding,", "I've read quite a few but what about Op feelings in the matter? Op did compromise, Op stated  her didn't want to wear a dress then it came around again Op still was patients then boom Op daughter flat out told her, I'm not dressing up in formal wear at all. Stop sugar coating; Yes she a child that's all you've been defending \" she a child this she's a child that\"  it's has nothing to do with maturity or how she is handling the change. We do not know the other side that Op did give us insight so creating one will not change the moral fact that Op daughter was disrespectful period she has no rule over the choice of attire of the theme, she can have an input but it's not her wedding; if anything the outfit can be worn but follow the same color theory of the wedding casual formal style a mix of both maybe but the outfit Op describe is not appropriate it's disrespectful.", "I feel like it\u2019s more of a cry out for attention, she wants to assert she\u2019s still important in her moms life, which is why it\u2019s so sad her mom gave not attending to be an option.", "On the wedding day, the husband would absolutely be more important than the kid", "I mean what if there isn\u2019t a bigger issue.\n\nI\u2019m honestly not sure there is.", "If you need to wear a t-shirt to a wedding, you should seek therapy. I think she's going to act out, because she's giving everything indication she will.", "She already has to by watching her mother get married to someone. That's out of her control. She can learn dress attire at events like homecoming, prom, junior high dances, etc. Mom can let her wear that, then get sent home for it, if it comes to it. But her not wanting to dress fancy isn't about that. Kids always have a meaning behind it. Read the comments, others have shared they acted out the same way because of their parent getting married. Kids just want to feel seen/heard like we all do. Even OP's fianc\u00e9 seems to get that", "Finally, someone talking sense. You can even date and have a social life, but maybe take the child you are responsible for feelings into serious consideration before moving another adult into their home.", "I was laughing when I read that because I was thinking what could she do? I'm imaging the daughter making fake profiles on dating apps using her moms picture and giving away her real phone number so OP constantly has people texting her and just showing up for dates that they think OP has agreed to. Going to be confused AF because she is going to be the women in the picture, but saying she's married lmao", "She doesn't have to respect their marriage. She has to respect her mom and she's purposely choosing an outfit to be annoying. She's trying to interfere in any way she can to control her mom. I generally side with the kids on forced step-family stuff but she doesn't get to stomp her feet and get her way just because she wants to. She doesn't respect their relationship anyway so, nothing will change. She needs to be told who the adults are and that she's not in charge of anything. NTA", "If/when she gets married, you should pull the same stunt at her wedding. Cause we all know how much REDDIT loves it when mother of the bride has an opinion on \u201cher daughter\u2019s day.\u201d Funny how this rule doesn\u2019t apply to the daughter trying to change dress code at mom\u2019s wedding. NTA OP.", "Kid wants to wear these clothes to the wedding she must have a formal portrait taken in those clothes at the wedding,  and she must look at the 8\u00d710 photo of this outfit on the family wall every single day for the rest of their time at home.

Deny them.", ">It would extremely embarrassing for Op daughter to be the only not dressed appropriately for the wedding \n\nSee, I have never ever understood this mentality. How is someone being dressed inappropriately embarrassing for anyone other than the person who is dressed weird?  Unless it's a kid young enough that the parents still pick out their clothes for them I don' get this mentality that what your children wear says something about you.", "It's an hyperbolic example, which very well might be true, to illustrate my point. This is also the reason why I included potentially. \n\nBoth commenters brought up the point that is it very likely it is not about the clothes. Both OP's behaviour and the behaviour of the daughter points towards this, and the commenter just ignores the whole point, and starts ranting about dress codes.

So instead, they overexaggerate a personal issue and lash out in a way that is \u201csafe\u201d (or socially acceptable in their circles) at someone who is \u201csafe\u201d such as their parents who are bound to them. \n\nIt\u2019s an unhealthy coping mechanism that many don\u2019t begin to grow out of until they are removed from their stressful environment (which is why many people begin to mature drastically in college).", "Maybe he feels she is twelve and hitting an age where this is a hill not worth dying on.
