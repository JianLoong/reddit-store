You will need to be in their favor when they rule the world.\n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\nThe poor kid is probably having feelings about you getting married, and you telling her basically \"well don't come, I don't care \" is not helping. Being that age is hard enough. \n\nYour child is more important than a wedding aesthetic.", "This isn't an asshole question. You have a reasonable request but your daughter is 12. She (I'm going to assume pronouns from yours but is she/her the right pronoun expression right now?) has very few things she has control of at a time when her emotions are all novel and very powerful. You're getting married and since she has been unwilling and resistant to the planning process, I suspect she's not super excited about your marriage. So she's digging in her heels and attempting to exercise the tiny amount of control over her life that she feels she has - over her immediate body and clothing.\n\nThreatening to cut her out of the wedding if she doesn't conform is only going to make her feel more unhappy and more powerless in this situation - and more desperate to cling to any method of asserting herself and expressing her feelings. Speaking as a (former) goth teenager you need to not die on this hill. You can express your feelings to her but if your feelings are that she needs to look a certain way to belong in your life/wedding - set it that idea on fire and let it go. Because that's what she, in her pre-teen angst, is hearing. She is hearing that you are getting married and she's only welcome in your new life if she looks nice and is obedient.\n\nLet her wear whatever dumb costume she wants to wear. Take family wedding pictures. Hang them on the wall. Act as if she looks totally normal and in a few years she's going to groan and feel really dumb over those pictures. But she'll also feel like she was loved and part of your life when you were changing both your lives dramatically. There is a small but very real possibility that if you stop fighting her on this she won't need to rebel so much and then you two can go shopping for a more formal (but probably still alternative) outfit that works as a compromise for you both.", "YTA.\n\nIf you can't see your kid is looking for reasons to be pissed at you...\n\nShe's not putting herself or anybody else in danger by wearing what she wants so let her do it.", "Yes,\n\nyou are not respecting her, you want your daughter to validate your marriage, let her be.\n\nYou won\u2019t respect her, you\u2019ll have bigger issue down the line.", "YTA Why does it make you happy to know your daughter will be feeling miserable at your wedding?

We got no information to think this marriage was rushed or that step-father was evil. Daughter might be having difficulties, and thats okay, and should be addressed, but its not a reason for her to get to wear a soccer t-shirt.\n\nAnd back to my funeral example, it can be really hard to accept someone is dead, but you're still expected to show up in black and do the proper cultural/religious rituals (or white in some cultures),", "I said more than bright color.

After all, OP makes this whole big deal to talk about how she was willing to give her child multiple options based on *gender* expectations but if you pay attention to the daughter\u2019s requested outfit, nothing about it is outside of what would generally be considered \u201cfeminine\u201d \u2014 skirt, heeled sandals, all traditionally feminine. The only thing that falls outside of that is the Jersey. Which, I\u2019m no child psychologist here, but one might be inclined to ask if that jersey has special meaning to her? Is it a comfort item? Does she wear that jersey \u201cfor good luck\u201d or when she knows she\u2019s going into uncertain territory? If the jersey is more of a security blanket than it is the hallmark of a rebellious teenager, that is something that should be explored and worked through. Not just huffed at.\n\nOr, if the jersey *is* just a rebellious teen being a rebellious teen, why not be seeking therapy to explore *why* they feel their mother\u2019s wedding is the place to rebel? A therapist might be able to phrase it in a way that would make sense to the kid. For example, \u201cI understand that in general, you are feeling frustrated with your mother\u2019s new marriage and you want to express that. But can you think back to a time when your parents were maybe angry with you around a birthday, or a holiday, and postponed that anger or that punishment so they could *allow* you to enjoy the day unadulterated? That is what your mother is asking you to do here with her wedding. Do you think that\u2019s a reasonable compromise?\u201d  \nBut has the mother done any of that? No, she hasn\u2019t. She\u2019s stomped her feet and said \u201cFine!

Just to prove that Mom's happiness isn't worth the tiniest concession.  The outfit is over the top ridiculous and disrespectful.", "The daughter is 12 or 13, right?

Daughter has refused. The options Mom has are to permissively enable daughter, to force her into appropriate clothes, or to just say don't come if you wont dress appropriately. None are great options, but the latter is a perfectly okay middle ground.\n\nThe comments child has made could be deep seated anxiety over the marriage, or they could (and far more likely) be a teenage girl rebelling and trying to say a hateful thing in the moment. Ya know, like how pretty much everyone (as a teenager) you have ever known has said something shitty to their mom that they didn't mean.", "maybe where you're from, but I have never been to funeral where black (or that very least very dark gray or blue) was not the expected dress code, where everyone complied.", "Because not everyone's first reaction is therapy. In fact, most people's first reaction isn't therapy. I get this board is very pro-therapy, but its not something required or expected for all of life's struggles. Most people don't have a therapist on speed dial (and you know they aren't cheap). And frankly, OP has given us no information to think there is an ongoing problem.\n\nMost people's first reaction to changing life events isn't force their teenager into therapy (or other mental health care).", "And the mother telling her daughter \"It'd be best for you not to come\" is clearly ignorant. A child already has little power to their voice being heard. This kid saying she wanted to wear a soccer jersey with a skirt is her way of a protest. Anyone can see that.
