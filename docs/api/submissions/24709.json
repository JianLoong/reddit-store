After months of scouring multiple local and national adoption agencies and adoption websites (i.e. adopapet.com, petfinder.com), we finally came across a puppy that we saw was being rehomed. He was only 5 months old at the time and he was exactly what we were looking for in a pup (hypoallergenic, apartment friendly, super cute, etc.) We submitted an application online and requested more information about him. After that, the owners contacted us and we learned more about the dog. His owners stated that they had purchased him from a breeder out of state, the wife originally didn\u2019t want the dog, but the husband did. After 2 months of having him, they realized it was - in short - too much for them with their jobs and made the incredibly hard decision to rehome him. After an extensive interview process and competing against many applicants, they chose us to take him home. We signed a contract stating the transfer of ownership and that we will neuter him, take care of him, so forth. They said they didn\u2019t want any money for the rehome, just for him to go to a loving home. We offered many times as well to give them some compensation for their previous expenses with him. \n\nMy partner and I drove to pick him up and at the hand off location. We were very excited and had prepared long and well for this moment. Right as we are about the leave, the husband states some requests he has for us. He stated that he would like it if he didn\u2019t change his name, as it meant a lot to him and his wife as he was named after their favorite book. He also requested that he would like to remain in contact with us for the dog.

I asked his mom for the kid\u2019s birthday and then made little postcards of Guinea pig pictures and he got one for bdays, Xmas, and Easter up until the little critter passed.\n\nBut, your circumstances seem different and like these people are being kind of overbearing.

That little floofy face!", "Yes, I did feel like there was no true reason to agree to his requests that I felt were quite ridiculous and restricting. But, I feel guilty that he truly loved him and wanted him but his wife wouldn\u2019t let him. Then again, he shouldn\u2019t have given him up if he didn\u2019t want to.", "I definitely won\u2019t be inviting them to anything.

I\u2019ll add one now if I can :) thank you!", "I felt badly to do no contact considering he did love the pup, but then again, he shouldn\u2019t have given rid of him if that were the case.", "It\u2019s posted :) thanks!", "Thanks!", "We discussed it many times (if he was ready) before we officially adopted him, I even asked him at the hand off location if he was sure about this, but we have him now! \nSo, whether or not he really was ready, the pup is ours.", "I agree!\nI believe in their minds they still feel like they\u2019re responsible for him because they were never financially compensated for him, even though we offered. \nIt\u2019s in the contract that if we decided to rehome him ourselves we would have to pay them a sum amount for their time and efforts and they would want him back. \nSo to me it seems like they never (or in reality he never) wanted him to go.", "We just stated that we will consider it but we would be able to email/text pictures of him.

He has been texting me about the dog since we left it off.", "I\u2019d say NAH. They clearly have an attachment to the dog, and at the same time they\u2019re giving him up so he can have a better life.

She\u2019d just as happily snuggle up to my husband as we said goodbye to them when they left; she clearly recognized them and liked them, but just as clearly was content with the fact that she was ours now.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s a moot point since it would obviously gonna cause *you* distress.

But I find it weird to rehome your dog, but ask to be visit him on holidays and birthdays? If you rehome, you let go. Forever. You\u2019re right that it could confuse the dog. Also, I would never really feel like his owner, more of a caretaker in between their visits. If he is so attached he either shouldn\u2019t rehome him, or accept the dog will be gone. NTA and I wish you many happy years with puppy!", "This guy thinks he should get to spend holidays with you? That's an insane demand.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Just nod and take the dog and if its not in a LEGAL written contract then they have no legal standing. Remember, not all contracts are enforceable and I would guess that the adoption contract is not legally binding.", "NTA They can make all types of requests. Doesn't mean you have to do them. They made the choice to rehome the dog. That means the dog is no longer theirs. \nYou need to change the name of the dog to fit into your family. Don't allow them any types of visits. As it can confuse the puppy. \n\nI have a dog that was rehomed to me and they tried giving me a list of all their requests. I told them Fuck No. And took the dog and had it chipped and registered to me.\n\nOne of the requests was to have him intact and unvaccinated and that they wanted the dog 4 days a week but I would need to buy it's food and walk him. I had him netured and got all his shots.  \n\nAnother request was that any puppies he sired they would want first dibs. \n\nI had that beautiful baby boy for 7 years until he passed on from cancer.", "NTA.  He's your dog now.  I agree with others suggesting that you pass along a pic every once in a while.\nI have a cat that I got from a friend of a friend.  She was a rescue and the person who rescued her wanted to keep her, but her older cat didn't like the kitten. I make occasional posts on my FB page w/her pic and my friend passes them along to her friend so she can see how the cat so doing.\n\nEdited to fix a sentence .", "Thank you \ud83e\udd70 he\u2019s a mini Aussiedoodle.

And videos at first so he can experience the puppy being happy. \n\nI rescued a puppy that I couldn't keep. The forever mama sent me a nicely framed photo and I was able to see other photos and video.", "NTA. Too bad they didn't tell you all their rules before you adopted their pup. \n\nSend them pictures to show how happy the pup is, and how much he is loved, but I don't see his original parents being invited over for Christmas and Thanksgiving dinners. LOL \n\nA former owner did once sent my cat a Christmas card, along with a nice letter telling him how glad they were that he found such a loving home. We changed the cat's name and he picked up the new moniker immediately but four years later I called him by his \"birth name\" to see what he would do. He stopped what he was doing and stared at me with a puzzled look. He remembered.  I tried this test a couple of other times after that and the response was always immediate. He was the smartest cart ever.", "He's so cute! NTA by the way - he's your dog now, so you should be able to give him a name you like. As far as visitation, that's a really weird request. Maybe you can just keep them updated with pictures now and then.", "I wouldnt worry about requests from an obviously caring person at the moment of seperation.   Likely his grief will soften as time goes by.   NTA for not following his requests.   The dog doesnt care what you call him...  \n\nYou should wonder what your dog named you too.. :)", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe dog is yours. Change the name any way you like. And block their numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey were just looking for a caretaker, not a new owner. NIP tihs in the bud.", "NTA these are strangers asking you to treat them as extended family so they don\u2019t have to commit to giving away their dog. You\u2019re right to be weirded out.", "NTA. The guy is crazy. Put nothing in writing, or if he has your home address, consider backing out of the \"adoption.\"\n\nIt is a DOG. You don't have to jump through these types of hoops to get a puppy.", "So we did the same thing almost 2 years ago. These people adopted two puppies which when they got to be about 8 months old started fighting badly! So they had to be kept separate until they were fixed and the vet wouldn't fix them until they were year because they're large breeds. So they contacted a rescue and somebody I know there contacted me with their information, and we met them to pick up the dog.\n\nWe kept his name cuz he was 9 months old and had known his name for 7 months. Plus it's a cute name for us! He's named after a brand of something that we also own... So it works. However had it only been 2 months that he knew his name I would have been comfortable changing it if I didn't like it.\n\nWe have sent pictures multiple times to them and they send pictures of the brother, they've also sent us baby pictures of our dog. We did get them fixed. They happen to be in the area once and asked if they could stop by and see him, and we allowed that. They're nice people & I would absolutely let them see him again, but if they had tried to give me some set schedule that so many times a year they get to see him... That's weird! Especially since your people only spent two months with your dog!\n\nI'm saying that I don't see anything wrong with you keeping in contact with them if that's what you want. However them insisting on a set schedule or a certain amount of visits is just weird and honestly there's nothing that can do about it if you don't do it so pretty much do whatever you are comfortable with. \n\nThanks for paying the dog tax! He's super cute!", "I was a bit confused, expecting that they wanted you to also take the dog's actual parents but you meant \"original owners.\"\n\nNTA - what kind of dork wants to stay in touch with a dog that they can't handle? \"We moved out of State / Province / whatever. Good bye.\"", "No home address, but he did try to come to the home for drop off and I did not agree to that. We met at a public park for the hand off that was miles away. \n\nWe already have him! And we are happy with him. Legally he is ours. I can choose whether or not I want to be \u201cnice\u201d per say and let him have contact.", "I looked at the pic of your dog and he is beautiful and I love him so much. Because I love him more than anything in the world (except for my own dog) I demand that you name him Leon, and I also demand an open invitation to your house for the dog's birthday, my birthday and for all holidays, plus whenever I want some bonding time with Leon.\n\nThis goes for everyone reading this comment and their dogs. I love all of your dogs and will come over to your house for dog hangs. Don't mind me, just let us hang out. This is my life's work, now. Hanging out and taking naps with dogs I love but aren't part of my household.\n\nOh, and NTA. Obviously just kidding. I wish that were my life.", "NTA at all.  I mean if the dog was ten years old and named Felix, and your trying to rename it SuperDog, might be confusing as fuck for the dog, but he\u2019ll figure it out.\n\nAs for keeping them previous owners in the loop, no.  No requirement at all.  You could give them updates, but that\u2019s not really required at all.\n\nThis is your dog now, they couldn\u2019t take care of it at all.", "Nta we changed our pups name right as we got him because Shadow is rather generic and silly. Called him Shane all the way home", "Leon is a nice name, but we did name him Mister Man already, sorry for that. Of course, your dog and my dog will be best friends and we should set that up immediately and spend every holiday together.", "OK deal! Mister Man out loud and in public (but Leon and I both low key know what's up.)", "Thank you. There are some names too ridiculous for even a pet; as a common-use name Mist Bourne is one of them. Calling him a shortened form would be fine (lord knows my pets have had weird names) but saying that mouthful every time you called him or spoke about him is too much.", "My dog looks similar to yours and one of his nicknames is Mr. Mister.\n\nAnd NTA! They are asking too much. If you want to be unnecessary nice you could send them 1-2 pictures a year--I send the shelter from which we adopted our dog a picture of him every year on his pupaversary, but that's mainly for them to use if they want on fundraising materials/social media/etc. I wouldn't do it for some guy, but it's not unheard of to give updates.", "I immediately checked out of the wheel of time show when I heard the main character's name is Rand Al Thor because my brain goes Randall Thor and makes me giggle since I'm a child lol. On weird pet names, I named my younger pup Callisto but 90% of the time she gets called potato or stinks \ud83d\ude02"]}
