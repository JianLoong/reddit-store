After months of scouring multiple local and national adoption agencies and adoption websites (i.e. adopapet.com, petfinder.com), we finally came across a puppy that we saw was being rehomed. He was only 5 months old at the time and he was exactly what we were looking for in a pup (hypoallergenic, apartment friendly, super cute, etc.) We submitted an application online and requested more information about him. After that, the owners contacted us and we learned more about the dog. His owners stated that they had purchased him from a breeder out of state, the wife originally didn\u2019t want the dog, but the husband did. After 2 months of having him, they realized it was - in short - too much for them with their jobs and made the incredibly hard decision to rehome him. After an extensive interview process and competing against many applicants, they chose us to take him home. We signed a contract stating the transfer of ownership and that we will neuter him, take care of him, so forth. They said they didn\u2019t want any money for the rehome, just for him to go to a loving home. We offered many times as well to give them some compensation for their previous expenses with him. \n\nMy partner and I drove to pick him up and at the hand off location. We were very excited and had prepared long and well for this moment. Right as we are about the leave, the husband states some requests he has for us. He stated that he would like it if he didn\u2019t change his name, as it meant a lot to him and his wife as he was named after their favorite book. He also requested that he would like to remain in contact with us for the dog. He stated holidays and birthdays he would like to be included to see the dog. \n\nMy partner and I already agreed that we were changing his name, as the name didn\u2019t flow to us at all and in reality, meant nothing to us. We also didn\u2019t like the pressure of having to have our new puppy rekindling with his old owners as we felt like it would be confusing to him and ruin his adjustment. In the end, we know it was a request but we feel guilty for not wanting to have them reconnect as well as feeling bad for changing the name. \n\nSo, are we the assholes?\n\nEDIT: I attached a link to the pup\u2019s picture :) [pup\u2019s picture](https://ibb.co/v4643GC)", "created_utc": 1692107703, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rtfmb/aita_for_not_wanting_to_include_my_puppys/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I asked his mom for the kid\u2019s birthday and then made little postcards of Guinea pig pictures and he got one for bdays, Xmas, and Easter up until the little critter passed.\n\nBut, your circumstances seem different and like these people are being kind of overbearing. I would honestly block contact info with them.", "NTA - but I forgot anything else I wanted to say when I saw the picture.  What an adorable pupper!!  So cute!  That little floofy face!", "Yes, I did feel like there was no true reason to agree to his requests that I felt were quite ridiculous and restricting. But, I feel guilty that he truly loved him and wanted him but his wife wouldn\u2019t let him. Then again, he shouldn\u2019t have given him up if he didn\u2019t want to.", "I definitely won\u2019t be inviting them to anything.

I\u2019ll add one now if I can :) thank you!", "I felt badly to do no contact considering he did love the pup, but then again, he shouldn\u2019t have given rid of him if that were the case.", "It\u2019s posted :) thanks!", "Thanks!", "We discussed it many times (if he was ready) before we officially adopted him, I even asked him at the hand off location if he was sure about this, but we have him now! \nSo, whether or not he really was ready, the pup is ours.", "I agree!\nI believe in their minds they still feel like they\u2019re responsible for him because they were never financially compensated for him, even though we offered. \nIt\u2019s in the contract that if we decided to rehome him ourselves we would have to pay them a sum amount for their time and efforts and they would want him back. \nSo to me it seems like they never (or in reality he never) wanted him to go.", "We just stated that we will consider it but we would be able to email/text pictures of him.

They clearly have an attachment to the dog, and at the same time they\u2019re giving him up so he can have a better life. You see yourselves as the owners now and don\u2019t see any logical reason for continuing any kind of relationship with his former owners.", "lol thanks", "Wouldn\u2019t necessarily distress the dog - our second dog\u2018s former owners dropped by a couple times, and she would happily greet them and demand cuddles. She\u2019d just as happily snuggle up to my husband as we said goodbye to them when they left; she clearly recognized them and liked them, but just as clearly was content with the fact that she was ours now.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s a moot point since it would obviously gonna cause *you* distress. If you\u2019re feeling kind, send the guy a pic from time to time so that he knows his doggie is doing well.", "At least you know now for future :)\n\nA very distinguished pupper.", "Block his number and cuddle your adorable doggo.", "That his is, which is why we named him Mister Man"]}
