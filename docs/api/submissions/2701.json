I wouldn't feel sorry for a thing said to a person like that.  Her child deserves better.", "NTA. They rehoused two dogs after essentially neglecting them and then abandoned their cat leading to its death. They showed lack of responsibility, abusive behaviour, and poor judgement several times over . Your comment was likely hard to hear, but honestly deserved. I was thinking the same thing regarding their baby. I hope to god it\u2019s not the case.", "Nta.....wow i hope you can be there for your niece when she needs it.", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t treat animals like objects you can just banish when they inconvenience you. If it happened once, I could understand that. Having a dog for the first time can be an eye-opening amount of responsibility. But that second time is just cruel. \n\nAlso, I genuinely wish them luck with that baby. Because if they don\u2019t like hard work, they\u2019re in for a minimum of 18 years of some of the hardest work there is.", "NTA. Some people need to hear hard truths about themselves or they\u2019ll keep repeating terrible behaviors. Your sister will think twice now before adopting another animal. And she\u2019ll  surely be careful with her kid. Good for you.", "NTA", "My opinion goes against whatever Miss Manners says.  Your point is valid, and I'm sure I would have said the same thing as you did--and not apologized for it, either.  You threw truth in her face, and she didn't like it.  I would sit back and make popcorn, but now there's a kid involved, too.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA I feel as if some people never understand what it really means for an animal or child to be 100% reliant on them to learn, eat, drink, survive etc. Responsibility as an adult is a hard lesson, and harder for some than others. It kind of sounds like your parents never forced her to take responsibilities for the decisions she made and it is happening now. No offense. My dad would've made me get in that car or on that bike and not get off until I learned it because I asked for it. It was my responsibility, or your sisters.", "nta i'm glad to hear your parents are on your side because it seems like you guys will need to step in when it comes to that baby", "I'd say 95% NTA, with 5% ESH because it seems like you've (understandably) found her behavior unacceptable for years, let that bottle up, and then blew up on her, instead of telling her you didn't support her selfish behavior while she was doing it. Sad that she feels these animals' (and possibly the baby's) lives are disposable, definitely TA.\n\nJust for some info, did you not know she was pregnant? From the way this is written it sounds like you hadn't seen her for over 9 months and she came to a family gathering with a child out of the blue", "You\u2019ve stumbled onto a shitty reality of life. You are 100% right but you\u2019re still gonna end up kinda being the ah for this", "Ick. Both the AH. It\u2019s not really your place if it doesn\u2019t involve you. But it\u2019s also shameful for her to rehome animals out of laziness. Your parents are right. You may have been right in what you said, but it wasn\u2019t your place to say. \nLife rule. Stay in your lane if you want others to do the same.", "Yikes.\n\nShe is TA but I think you took it too far when you involved the child (even though you made a very valid point). \n\nSoft YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
