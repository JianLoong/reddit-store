He asked why we can\u2019t just go on Sunday and I said it\u2019s a school night, why can\u2019t he just see his friends on Sunday because we had plans first. Now we\u2019re lightly arguing because he keeps saying things like \u201cI guess i\u2019m just r\\*tarded\u201d and \u201ci just disappoint you\u201d.

I don\u2019t understand why he can\u2019t just spend the whole day with them and then go on a date with me around 5pm. That\u2019s all I ask. \n\nAITA for canceling our plans?\n\nEdit: Now he\u2019s mad because I don\u2019t want to reschedule. I told him I shouldn\u2019t have to reschedule when I had plans first. I planned a week in advance on purpose.\n\nEdit 2: I told him that it felt like i was second best. He said \u201csorry but they\u2019ve been my #1 since middle school\u201d.
