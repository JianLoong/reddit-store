I planned a week in advance on purpose.\n\nEdit 2: I told him that it felt like i was second best. He said \u201csorry but they\u2019ve been my #1 since middle school\u201d. I\u2019m starting to really reconsider being with him. I don\u2019t expect to be more important than his friends, but i do expect to be at least a little respected\n\nEdit 3: Talked to him more about it. He apologized and said from now on I\u2019m going to be his first priority and choice. i\u2019m his first gf and this is our first argument\u2026so i hope he keeps his word.
