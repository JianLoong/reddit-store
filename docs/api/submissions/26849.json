I have been in a relationship with my husband for 11 years and we have been married for 9 years. My stepkids are in our house every other week and with their mom every other week. The relationship with my stepkids is okay. Not perfect but not totally awful. They have always kept some walls up between me and them and my family and them. Polite and they'll talk friendly enough. But they don't want to be a part of family things with us either.\n\nMy mom has this cookbook that has been used by four generations of the family now. My grandma started it with her and her kids and then my mom got it and shared it with me and my siblings and now she shares it with her grandkids. Emma and Luke were offered to take part multiple times and they have always said they weren't interested. My mom was a little upset but understood that they might not be totally okay with that idea and she has left it open for them to change their minds.\n\nLast year Dex took part in the tradition for the first time with mom and I. My stepkids did not want to join us so we didn't force it. Dex regularly now cooks recipes from it with my mom (and sometimes me too). He loves it. He wants to add another recipe when he's older, something we've all done.\n\nThe topic came up while my ILs were around and Dex was telling them all about it. He mentioned how much he loves being part of it and he loves cooking and baking. My ILs asked if Emma and Luke had ever been a part of it and we said no, they hadn't wanted to be. They asked why not and we said they didn't seem the most comfortable with fully integrating like that as to be part of something that is a family tradition on my side but it will always be open for them to change their mind. They said we should have waited for them to include Dex and how my family and I have shown we don't care if they're involved or not. I told them they might never change their minds. They said I have made it so they won't now. They know my bio kid is more wanted by my family. I said that's unfair. They have been offered the chance many times and Dex shouldn't have to miss out because his siblings say no.\n\nThey said that's my role as a mom of three instead of a mom of one. I told them I would not make my son miss out just because my stepkids said no. They said that's why I'm wrong and why I am proving to be a poor parent to the non-bio kids that I have. My husband told them to leave and said they were wrong. But they insisted it was me who was wrong here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694704970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16il92n/aita_for_telling_my_ils_i_wont_exclude_my_child/", "score": 1210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(For many things, not all) They are not six or seven-year-olds who are actually children and should have extra consideration for things. They are grown enough to know what they want and don't want. They said no so it is a no! Dex is an actual little kid, he deserves to do things he wants to do despite what his step-siblings are doing or not doing.", "NTA \n\nAbsolutely not. In fact, you\u2019re being a good parent to all of them being flexible to their wants. If step-kids didn\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine as you didn\u2019t push them so. In fact, your family left the door open to them in case they do change their minds. \n\nAnd Dex should not be told to wait. Have him shine on this awesome hobby of baking. ILs went way out of bounds for these suggestions.", "NTA. Unlike your IL\u2019s, you actually *asked* your step kids what *they* wanted, and then respected their autonomy. And you\u2019ve let the step kids know that they\u2019re welcome to participate whenever they\u2019d like to, and are comfortable doing so. Moreover, their father agrees with your approach.\n\nThe grandparents sound incredibly self-absorbed.", "NTA.  Not every child -- biological or step -- has an equal interest in their parents' family traditions and/or cultural practices.  Your in-laws need to accept and be happy for your biological son's interests and chill about their your step children's lack of interest.\n\nI would tell them that you don't show your love for someone by denying them opportunities. You show it by providing them with choices.", "NTA - if they were 3 bio-kids (I hate that phrase btw), would they still have the stance that Dex can't do something if Emma and Luke don't want to?\n\nI get that your in-laws are being protective of your step-kids, but they are out of line with this conversation.", "NTA. It was an open invitation they choose not to take up. Dear Husband is on your page. Keep doing what you are doing\u2026.the step kids will join if and when ready. Don\u2019t bring it up with the in-laws again.", "NTA\n\nIL's just want an excuse to vilify you to your face, likely the way they have been vilifying you behind your back.\n\nYou left the door open to your step kids. They declined multiple times. It is wildly inappropriate to deny your child his heritage just because your step kids were not interested.", "NTA. You offer, they decline. It sounds like an awesome tradition but some people just don\u2019t like to cook. Im one if them. I HATE to cook & it shows when l do cook. Sounds to me like the IL are jealous that the don\u2019t have something to offer the step kids.", "NTA. You tried your best to get them involved and you listened to their wants when they declined. Maybe try to start some new family traditions that they are more interested in?", "NTA.\n\nWhat are the odds your in-laws would be up your ass if you had forced the stepkids to participate? Now you're the evil overbearing stepmom that tramples boundaries.\n\nSo what, Dex is just supposed to miss out on things with your side of the family because your teenage stepkids don't want to be involved? That way everybody loses, so it's more fair? Give me a break.\n\nYour in-laws should butt out.", "Absolutely NTA-You\u2019ve made it clear they are welcome to join in but you wouldn\u2019t force the issue. They\u2019ve made it clear they aren\u2019t currently interested. Your in laws are just looking for drama and strife. Good for you for not denying your son a family tradition.", "NTA \nFirst off it\u2019s always an option for your step kids that you\u2019ve offered and sounds like you won\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) deny. \n\nSecond, ruining something nice for your 6-year old isn\u2019t going to make the other kids feel better either. The ILs/grandparents sound slightly controlling, and jealous they didn\u2019t do something like this to bond with all 3 of them.", "NTA. Your step kids have their boundaries which is perfectly fine and you need to make that known to your in-laws.", "NTA. You're being an excellent mom. Just bc one child (or two) doesn't want to do something, doesn't mean you don't allow the other children to do it. As long as your step kids know that at any time if they want to join in they are more than welcome that's all you need to worry about. If one of your kids did not like to go swimming, would you stop the other kids from going swimming? No you wouldn't. Don't pay any attention to your in-laws they're being silly", "NTA. All you did was respect their choice without imposing anything on them and instead protecting your child's.\n\nI'm a big fan of the \"don't force relationships between people\" concept, your stepchildren have set some boundaries making it clear (in my opinion) that they don't feel comfortable considering you or your family as part of theirs and personally I don't see anything wrong with it as long as there is a mutual relationship of respect and politeness.\n\nOn the other hand, just as they have the right to get out of a situation that doesn't make them comfortable, your child has every right to want to be included and be part of this family tradition of yours without being influenced by the decisions of others.\n\nAs for your ILs they must realize that blended families are particular although it would be nice if everyone got along well and everyone was treated as equals in situations like this it doesn't always happen so it's better to settle for an \"imperfect\" family balance rather than forcing things and risking destroying everything.\n\nEDIT: grammar", "NTA and congratulations on your husband for sticking up for you. \n\nBeing a step parent is a lot like walking a tight rope. I think you did just fine and fair by your step kids. Forcing the issue, mandatory fun, is never a great way to go with otherwise voluntary activities.", "Can anyone point out the least liked grandchild in this scenario? I\u2019m thinking Dex?  NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have offered to include them, same as your bio kiddo.  They don't want to, fair enough!  Your in laws need to mind their business.", "NTA. Your child's life experiences should never be held hostage by his half-siblings lack of interest. You offered to include them, they declined, you accepted their decision but said the door is always open if they change their mind.  You were gracious and respectful towards them, but IMO your in-laws seem to be under the impression that anything you do separately with your kid is a slight to other two which is twisted and entitled thinking. I would hope that you would treat your stepchildren exactly the same even if they were your own biological children. Want to participate in this family tradition? No? That's okay, if you change your mind would love to have you.", "NTA. You asked them if they wanted to participate and they declined and you respected their answers. This is where the generations of parenting differ. The IL's come from a generation of \"you do what I want you to do kid and what I say goes\", meanwhile our generation are raising our children to have voices and opinions and it drives the older generation crazy. It doesn't sound at all like you are a poor parent and instead are letting the kids pick and choose what family traditions they take part in. Your IL's are the ones in the wrong here. Unfortunately I don't think they will believe you unless you actually bring it up in front of them with the step kids, which will probably start another argument.", "Nta. Your step kids don't want to be pushed into a tradition on your side. That's okay. You aren't pushing the idea on the step kids, that shows you put their best interests ahead of your own. You're a good step mom and it's nice to see a step parent story here that isn't ah post. Good for you for allowing the kids to choose their paths and relationships. I hope your youngest enjoys cooking and creating traditions with your side.", "NTA you gave your step kids a chance and they weren't interested. You made it clear they were still welcome in the future. Your in laws are being unreasonable", "NTA. Oh, for crying out loud! Your in-laws are being ridiculous. If their grandchildren want to drink water, they don't wait for you to drag them to a glass, do they?\n\nAnd what's best for kids is to acknowledge when they tell you they aren't interested in doing something and then go on about your happy danged business and do it by yourself. Dex should not lose out on anything just because no other kid in the family wants to participate. \n\nYour role as a mom is not to be a robotic C-3PO Tell them that.", "NTA. Your ILs are wrong to expect you to make your son miss out on something he enjoys just because his siblings don't want to take part. It's not fair for them to expect that of you, and your husband was right to tell them to leave.", "NTA you're not mom to 3, you're mom to 1 and step parent or wife of father to the other two. From your description your husband's kids don't see you as parent figure and don't want that relationship with you which is fine! You're doing great keeping the door open for them and including them as much as they want.", "These in-laws are ridiculous.  Dex should be denied the opportunity because the other two don't want it?  That's just dumb.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nPart of being a good parent is accepting your kid\u2019s saying no and respecting it wherever possible. You did that.", "NTA. Your IL are way out of line. You gave your step kids every opportunity to participate and have done the RIGHT thing by always allowing them to choose what they\u2019re comfortable with. Maybe one day they will, maybe they won\u2019t. The point is the option is always open to them. You have also done the right thing by including your son in the tradition and it being a joyful experience. Your in-laws are the ones showing favoritism by stating your son shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do anything unless his much older siblings do it which is ridiculous. I\u2019m glad your husband stood up for you. Good luck with everything and keep doing what you\u2019re doing!!", "\"I told them I would not make my son miss out just because my stepkids said no.\"\n\nIL's are out of line.

That doesn't mean their no means no for your other child. \n\nNTA.", "Did you feed your step children milk from the bottle or by breast feeding? No well then ILs probably think you should have had Dex wait to do that until the siblings decided to do it. \n\nBut seriously it sucks to be forced to do things you dont want to do and you probably would have just forced the kids away. Dex is at an age where he will do anything you tell him to and he'll figure out what he likes.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat a nutty accusation to throw at you!", "They are shit stirrers. Created drama when there was no conflict  NTA.", "NTA \n\nShe inserted her nose in her son\u2019s business.", "NTA Sounds like some people show favoritism to their bio relatives, and it isn't you.

Even if it\u2019s something traditional, if one person don\u2019t want to do it or want to do something else instead, why force them? If they want to someday maybe they can join in, but for now they said no and that should be respected. The person who said yes should also be respected regardless of if their siblings said no.", "INFO- Did the in laws ask Emma and Luke if they wanted to be included?\n\nYou have asked them several times and got a 'no' several times. You can't force them to participate in your family rituals. You have a fairly good relationship and if you push this, you could alienate them. Tell your in-laws to ask the children what they want.", "NTA. You and your mum have given your step kids more than enough opportunity to join in, and it seems like they are welcome to change their mind too. Not more you can do on that.\nI hope your husband stands by you in this and also sort out the attitude of your ILs.\nIt is a lovely family tradition to share recipes and cook together. I hope this doesn't take away the joy for you to continue the tradition.", "Hugs, NTA so they want you to ignore family with the child you gave birth to because their other two grandchildren don't want to do it. or be involved in it.  That is so wrong.  You can't force teens to do what you want.  Your inlaws see what you're doing as a competition and if your child is doing something that they aren't a part of your child shouldn't be doing it.", "I agree with you that they are old enough to know what they do and don't want. Even when they were younger and offered, it's one of those things where you can't force it and expect a good outcome. Which is why we didn't and left the offer open.\n\nJust a small correction. Dex and my stepkids are half siblings, not stepsiblings.", "And Dex may even want to drop it once he gets into his teens...if that's the case, he will probably not want to for a few years because teens often turn into jerks for a few years then regain their sanity after a while.  It's a fact that those puberty hormones mess with your mind like crazy.  Teen brain is as much a thing as pregnancy brain is.  It causes one to forget, to be moody, to feel things more deeply, and to feel like small things could be the end of the world.  Thank goodness it stops after a few years!", "Not legal adults yet, yes they can have sex, drive a moped or A tractor  and take care of their own money, but 18 is the year  we Swedes turn legal adults.\n\n'", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Exactly I doubt they will change their minds but if they do the option is open. However in the in laws minds the youngest might never get to be a part of his mother's family tradition and they seem okay with that. I doubt they would be if it was the other way around.", "Do I spy a Bluey fan?", "You have offered to include them, same as your bio kiddo. They don't want to, fair enough! Your in laws need to mind their business.", "I do agree with your point. However the age of majority in Sweden is 18 years. The age of consent is 15 years, but that does not mean you are a legal adult.", "NTA", "What are the odds your in-laws would be up your ass if you had forced the stepkids to participate? Now you're the evil overbearing stepmom that tramples boundaries", "First off it\u2019s always an option for your step kids that you\u2019ve offered and sounds like you won\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) deny.", "He's really loving it too! But Dex loves all things food to begin with lol. I love seeing him be so happy in the kitchen.", "I wonder how the ILs would feel if OP applied their suggested rule to all 3 of the kids and the the older kids couldn't do things unless Dex is also interested in them and can do them.", "It sounds like the ILs are looking for reasons to bitch about OP", "I truly don't believe this would be an issue if all three were my biological children.", ">Sounds to me like the IL are jealous that the don\u2019t have something to offer the step kids.\n\nhmm, they are the boring family?  You might have something here, if the older kids are involved more in their mother's family the grandparents may be upset that they are drifting away and expecting OP to fix the problem.", "We have tried that. They mostly take no interest in that kind of stuff from my side of the family. It's not like they complain about being around them. But the actual family traditions and stuff are things they seem to have a line around. With time maybe they'll be more open to joining or maybe not. At least we can all get along okay.", "Those were some pretty aggressive things to say to OP. Glad Hubby kicked them out.", "Either way, the kids didn't wanted to and it would've been wrong to force them.", "We did what we could without forcing them. We made the offer and asked if there was a reason why they didn't want to be involved. We have left the door open for them as well and they are still included as part of the family even if they don't take part in the tradition.\n\nAnd there was no affair going on. I met my husband 2 years after his divorce.", "My god how much more did OP have to do????????????", "What is wrong with you? You're just making shit up. OP and her family did everything right. They welcomed the kids, they invited them to be a part of it. They weren't pushy, which would have made things exponentially worse. They've left the doors open to kids to change their minds and be part of the family if they choose. The only people who suck and the meddling inlaws", "Why does OP suck though? They\u2019ve given the invitation and aren\u2019t forcing the matter, that is pretty good parenting.", "So here's a question. Did the grandparents ***even bother to ask*** their teenage grandchildren how they felt about this? Or are they just assuming that the half-sibs were purposely excluded by your family?\n\nNTA. You're doing it right in a tough environment. Keep it up. I can only hope that someday in the future your step kids become more open to a closer relationship with you.", "NTA You\u2019re respecting the kids boundaries in good way. One of the reasons I bonded with my steps was because nothing was ever forced on me. You have done a good job of leaving things open and I think it\u2019s really sweet that your mom wants them included but still backed off. You\u2019re doing it right. You may never be the Brady Bunch but there is nothing wrong with mutual love, trust, and respect.", "Sorry, I read half and typed step... I have no idea why.  \nAnyway! Do not worry about it! If you had sat there and pressured the two teens into taking part, everyone would have been miserable. Something their mom doesn't seem to get, or maybe doesn't want to. You did just fine, Dex is very lucky!", "You are doing awesome you are NTA they are you are letting you step children choose ans your birthed child choose. Your IL are the problem people", "NTA\n\nOP, I'm pleased for you that your young Dex wants to participate in the family cooking tradition. It looks like you've been kind to your step-kids and respectful of their choice not to participate.\n\nWhat I'm happiest to see is that their dad, your DH, is not allowing his parents to continue their unkind and combative stance about the children and your family's tradition. Their thinking is biased, illogical, and unkind.\n\nYou and your nice little family just keep on as you have been because it's positive and fun. \n\n\ud83e\udd68\ud83e\udd56\ud83e\udd50\ud83e\udd59\ud83c\udf65\ud83e\udd57\ud83c\udf72\ud83c\udf5c\ud83e\udd63\ud83e\udd58\ud83e\udd6f\ud83e\udd5e\ud83c\udf82\ud83e\udd6e", "I bet your ILs would have been less than thrilled if you had forced your step kids to participate. Unfortunately, this seems like a situation where you are damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t", "Can you imagine how much resentment this would have caused between all the kids? \u201cNo, Dex, you can\u2019t cook with grandma because your half sister didn\u2019t want to. We have to wait until your siblings say it\u2019s ok.\u201d Do your in-laws\u2019 want their grandkids to hate each other?", "There are so many stories in this sub of step kids suffering because their parents are trying to force them into a \"perfect family\" image that they don't want.\n\nI think you're doing really well to take the lead from the kids while leaving the door open for more if they want.  ILs can stuff it.", "OP you are doing a great job, you\u2019ve made it known to them they are welcome to join at any time and you\u2019d all love to have them participate. You\u2019ve respected their feelings and not put any pressure on them at all. Really awesome job. \n\nYour in laws seem to have maybe read too many fairy tales and think that if you aren\u2019t giving all the children the exact same things, for absolutely everything, then you\u2019ll turn into an evil step mother. I wonder if your ILs would be bringing this up at all, if they were your bio children and didn\u2019t want to participate in the tradition? \n\nEven in nuclear families, where everyone is blood related, children have different wants, needs and interests. They spend time with their parents/grandparents separately to their siblings, especially with larger age gaps. \n\nYou and your husband are handling things brilliantly. The ILs probably have very little experience of blended families and honestly don\u2019t have a clue what they are talking about. \n\nA lot of the time in step parenting, you\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. But you\u2019ve taken the best approach here, don\u2019t let your ILs make you doing yourself on that.", "If they were all siblings, not half-siblings, you would be the glass bowl for forcing your older children to participate in an activity they had no interest in. For example, if you grew up enjoying innocuous activity with your parents and wanted to pass on that enjoyment of innocuous activity to your child, but as your child got older, your child was not as enamored with innocuous activity as you are, then letting your child skip innocuous activity makes sense.", "Honestly, good for you for respecting your stepchildren\u2019s boundaries. They don\u2019t want to be involved, which is fine, and it\u2019s good that you respect that. You let them know that the door is open to change their mind. That\u2019s great. \n\nForcing them to cooperate, or to integrate with your family traditions if they don\u2019t want to, would have been disrespecting their boundaries. Your relationship might not be what you, or your IL\u2019s, hoped it would be\u2026but it sounds healthy because you offer to include and respect their right to decline. Good job.", "You would have been the ass hole if you tried to force your step kids into your side of the family against their will. You respected their feelings and your MIL doesn't know what she's talking about. You're the one living the Step Mom life, don't listen to her. NTA", "So they are mad you respected your stepchildren\u2019s boundaries? They are really reaching to make you the evil stepmother huh? NTA.  \n\nIt is absolutely unreasonable to exclude your son on account of his siblings not wanting to do this. If they were your children I imagine it would be the same.\n\nWhat do your in laws want? You to blatantly disregard your step children\u2019s boundaries? Or deprive your son of a family hobby he loves and cause him to resent his half-siblings (and you, and your mom)? That\u2019s ABSURD. You did the right thing by all your kids.", "Would they be this upset if all the children were yours genetically and the two oldest still didn't want to participate?? I doubt it... They are just picking a fight because you have a family tradition, and they cannot control it.", "I know, I live in Sweden. Thus for the most part tag I added.", "Yes! I am way too old for that show but it was just too cute. <.< I will be forcing my brother to allow my nephew to watch it.", "Then keep nurturing that. You\u2019re doing great OP!", "you let the older kids eat the food (if they are around) right?", "You are doing the right thing, let tge kids know they are welcome to be part of it as you consider them your kids blood related or not and you will always be there for them in whatever capacity they are comfortable with. Don't let the IL force a negative reaction and if they bring it up again bring those kids in and ask how they feel about it. Let them sit there and listen to the kids say we don't care he can do it if he wants and give them a fucking told you so morons smirk lol", "[deleted]", "IMO OP sucks because she keeps saying it\u2019s due to the kids not wanting to fully integrate into the family but in reality they may just not want to cook. And the mother being sad about it, idk seems like something my mom would say", "They never asked my stepkids how they felt about it.", "My first thought.", "I absolutely agree. Too many times the parents in a blended family push for an instant integration of all the kids. The kids suddenly have to be friends with a near stranger, share a house with a near stranger, do religion, holidays and parties with a near stranger, share all their toys and clothes with a near stranger, share sports and hobbies and friends groups with a near stranger... It never goes well. Kindness and politeness between all the family members is more than some bio families can do, but that's the ground floor for a blended family to allow the children to build an independent relationship with their siblings", "He's really loving it too! But Dex loves all things food to begin with lol. I love seeing him be so happy in the kitchen.", "Yes, of course.", "Your entire point is based off the assumption she may not have a good relationship with the kids, which we just simply don\u2019t know", "see this is kind of all you need to know. they\u2019re picking a fight to pick a fight, not because they\u2019re very invested in the actual stakes. or maybe they have different stakes (jealous of your mom\u2019s time with dex? idk, just speculating) we don\u2019t know about. either way, nta. dex is his own person, not a teaching tool to his siblings. he gets to have his own life and interests, just as they do. respecting your kid\u2019s boundaries is a good thing, and including kids when they want to be included is a good thing. if you put your life and dex\u2019s life on hold until his siblings want to be involved, the whole family will just learn to resent each other.", "It's pretty obvious they don't actually care about the tradition. They wanted to fight with you.\n\nDo they often pick fights or try to put wedges in your family? Eggshells type situation when they are around?", "This is where you are different from them. You took your step kids\u2019 opinions and comfort levels into account, and you didn\u2019t force them to take part in a tradition they\u2019re not comfortable with. Your in-laws, on the other hand, think that the adults should make the choices regardless of what the kids want. \n\nEven if they were all your bio kids, it\u2019s possible that the older two still wouldn\u2019t want to participate for some reason, and that would still be fine! It would still be their choice. \n\nYou\u2019re doing a great job of respecting who your step kids are as people, and that makes me really happy.", "I doubt this is news, but your in-laws don't like you.", " In laws are looking to create drama, don\u2019t give them the satisfaction.", "They wanted to attack her for leaving out the stepkids. When they found out she didn't they had to take another antagonistic stance even if it didn't even make sense."]}
