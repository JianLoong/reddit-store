I have been in a relationship with my husband for 11 years and we have been married for 9 years. My stepkids are in our house every other week and with their mom every other week. The relationship with my stepkids is okay. Not perfect but not totally awful. They have always kept some walls up between me and them and my family and them. Polite and they'll talk friendly enough. But they don't want to be a part of family things with us either.\n\nMy mom has this cookbook that has been used by four generations of the family now. My grandma started it with her and her kids and then my mom got it and shared it with me and my siblings and now she shares it with her grandkids. Emma and Luke were offered to take part multiple times and they have always said they weren't interested. My mom was a little upset but understood that they might not be totally okay with that idea and she has left it open for them to change their minds.\n\nLast year Dex took part in the tradition for the first time with mom and I. My stepkids did not want to join us so we didn't force it. Dex regularly now cooks recipes from it with my mom (and sometimes me too). He loves it. He wants to add another recipe when he's older, something we've all done.\n\nThe topic came up while my ILs were around and Dex was telling them all about it. He mentioned how much he loves being part of it and he loves cooking and baking. My ILs asked if Emma and Luke had ever been a part of it and we said no, they hadn't wanted to be. They asked why not and we said they didn't seem the most comfortable with fully integrating like that as to be part of something that is a family tradition on my side but it will always be open for them to change their mind. They said we should have waited for them to include Dex and how my family and I have shown we don't care if they're involved or not. I told them they might never change their minds. They said I have made it so they won't now. They know my bio kid is more wanted by my family. I said that's unfair. They have been offered the chance many times and Dex shouldn't have to miss out because his siblings say no.\n\nThey said that's my role as a mom of three instead of a mom of one. I told them I would not make my son miss out just because my stepkids said no. They said that's why I'm wrong and why I am proving to be a poor parent to the non-bio kids that I have. My husband told them to leave and said they were wrong. But they insisted it was me who was wrong here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694704970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16il92n/aita_for_telling_my_ils_i_wont_exclude_my_child/", "score": 3081, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(For many things, not all) They are not six or seven-year-olds who are actually children and should have extra consideration for things. They are grown enough to know what they want and don't want. They said no so it is a no! Dex is an actual little kid, he deserves to do things he wants to do despite what his step-siblings are doing or not doing.", "NTA \n\nAbsolutely not. In fact, you\u2019re being a good parent to all of them being flexible to their wants. If step-kids didn\u2019t want to, that\u2019s fine as you didn\u2019t push them so. In fact, your family left the door open for them in case they do change their minds. \n\nAnd Dex should not be told to wait. Have him shine on this awesome hobby of baking. ILs went way out of bounds for these suggestions.", "NTA. Unlike your IL\u2019s, you actually *asked* your step kids what *they* wanted, and then respected their autonomy. And you\u2019ve let the step kids know that they\u2019re welcome to participate whenever they\u2019d like to, and are comfortable doing so. Moreover, their father agrees with your approach.\n\nThe grandparents sound incredibly self-absorbed.", "NTA.  Not every child -- biological or step -- has an equal interest in their parents' family traditions and/or cultural practices.  Your in-laws need to accept and be happy for your biological son's interests and chill about their your step children's lack of interest.\n\nI would tell them that you don't show your love for someone by denying them opportunities. You show it by providing them with choices.", "NTA - if they were 3 bio-kids (I hate that phrase btw), would they still have the stance that Dex can't do something if Emma and Luke don't want to?\n\nI get that your in-laws are being protective of your step-kids, but they are out of line with this conversation.", "NTA. It was an open invitation they choose not to take up. Dear Husband is on your page. Keep doing what you are doing\u2026.the step kids will join if and when ready. Don\u2019t bring it up with the in-laws again.", "NTA\n\nIL's just want an excuse to vilify you to your face, likely the way they have been vilifying you behind your back.\n\nYou left the door open to your step kids. They declined multiple times. It is wildly inappropriate to deny your child his heritage just because your step kids were not interested.", "NTA. You offer, they decline. It sounds like an awesome tradition but some people just don\u2019t like to cook. Im one if them. I HATE to cook & it shows when l do cook. Sounds to me like the IL are jealous that the don\u2019t have something to offer the step kids.", "NTA. You tried your best to get them involved and you listened to their wants when they declined. Maybe try to start some new family traditions that they are more interested in?", "NTA.\n\nWhat are the odds your in-laws would be up your ass if you had forced the stepkids to participate? Now you're the evil overbearing stepmom that tramples boundaries.\n\nSo what, Dex is just supposed to miss out on things with your side of the family because your teenage stepkids don't want to be involved? That way everybody loses, so it's more fair? Give me a break.\n\nYour in-laws should butt out.", "Absolutely NTA-You\u2019ve made it clear they are welcome to join in but you wouldn\u2019t force the issue. They\u2019ve made it clear they aren\u2019t currently interested. Your in laws are just looking for drama and strife. Good for you for not denying your son a family tradition.", "NTA \nFirst off it\u2019s always an option for your step kids that you\u2019ve offered and sounds like you won\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t) deny. \n\nSecond, ruining something nice for your 6-year old isn\u2019t going to make the other kids feel better either. The ILs/grandparents sound slightly controlling, and jealous they didn\u2019t do something like this to bond with all 3 of them.", "NTA. Your step kids have their boundaries which is perfectly fine and you need to make that known to your in-laws.", "NTA. You're being an excellent mom. Just bc one child (or two) doesn't want to do something, doesn't mean you don't allow the other children to do it. As long as your step kids know that at any time if they want to join in they are more than welcome that's all you need to worry about. If one of your kids did not like to go swimming, would you stop the other kids from going swimming? No you wouldn't. Don't pay any attention to your in-laws they're being silly", "NTA. All you did was respect their choice without imposing anything on them and instead protecting your child's.\n\nI'm a big fan of the \"don't force relationships between people\" concept, your stepchildren have set some boundaries making it clear (in my opinion) that they don't feel comfortable considering you or your family as part of theirs and personally I don't see anything wrong with it as long as there is a mutual relationship of respect and politeness.\n\nOn the other hand, just as they have the right to get out of a situation that doesn't make them comfortable, your child has every right to want to be included and be part of this family tradition of yours without being influenced by the decisions of others.\n\nAs for your ILs they must realize that blended families are particular although it would be nice if everyone got along well and everyone was treated as equals in situations like this it doesn't always happen so it's better to settle for an \"imperfect\" family balance rather than forcing things and risking destroying everything.\n\nEDIT: grammar", "NTA and congratulations on your husband for sticking up for you. \n\nBeing a step parent is a lot like walking a tight rope. I think you did just fine and fair by your step kids. Forcing the issue, mandatory fun, is never a great way to go with otherwise voluntary activities.", "Can anyone point out the least liked grandchild in this scenario? I\u2019m thinking Dex?  NTA", "NTA\n\nYou have offered to include them, same as your bio kiddo.  They don't want to, fair enough!  Your in laws need to mind their business.", "NTA. Your child's life experiences should never be held hostage by his half-siblings lack of interest. You offered to include them, they declined, you accepted their decision but said the door is always open if they change their mind.  You were gracious and respectful towards them, but IMO your in-laws seem to be under the impression that anything you do separately with your kid is a slight to other two which is twisted and entitled thinking. I would hope that you would treat your stepchildren exactly the same even if they were your own biological children. Want to participate in this family tradition? No? That's okay, if you change your mind would love to have you.", "NTA. You asked them if they wanted to participate and they declined and you respected their answers. This is where the generations of parenting differ. The IL's come from a generation of \"you do what I want you to do kid and what I say goes\", meanwhile our generation are raising our children to have voices and opinions and it drives the older generation crazy. It doesn't sound at all like you are a poor parent and instead are letting the kids pick and choose what family traditions they take part in. Your IL's are the ones in the wrong here. Unfortunately I don't think they will believe you unless you actually bring it up in front of them with the step kids, which will probably start another argument.", "Nta. Your step kids don't want to be pushed into a tradition on your side. That's okay. You aren't pushing the idea on the step kids, that shows you put their best interests ahead of your own. You're a good step mom and it's nice to see a step parent story here that isn't ah post. Good for you for allowing the kids to choose their paths and relationships. I hope your youngest enjoys cooking and creating traditions with your side.", "NTA you gave your step kids a chance and they weren't interested. You made it clear they were still welcome in the future. Your in laws are being unreasonable", "NTA. Oh, for crying out loud! Your in-laws are being ridiculous. If their grandchildren want to drink water, they don't wait for you to drag them to a glass, do they?\n\nAnd what's best for kids is to acknowledge when they tell you they aren't interested in doing something and then go on about your happy danged business and do it by yourself. Dex should not lose out on anything just because no other kid in the family wants to participate. \n\nYour role as a mom is not to be a robotic C-3PO Tell them that.", "NTA. Your ILs are wrong to expect you to make your son miss out on something he enjoys just because his siblings don't want to take part. It's not fair for them to expect that of you, and your husband was right to tell them to leave.", "NTA you're not mom to 3, you're mom to 1 and step parent or wife of father to the other two. From your description your husband's kids don't see you as parent figure and don't want that relationship with you which is fine! You're doing great keeping the door open for them and including them as much as they want.", "These in-laws are ridiculous.  Dex should be denied the opportunity because the other two don't want it?  That's just dumb.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nPart of being a good parent is accepting your kid\u2019s saying no and respecting it wherever possible. You did that.", "NTA. Your IL are way out of line. You gave your step kids every opportunity to participate and have done the RIGHT thing by always allowing them to choose what they\u2019re comfortable with. Maybe one day they will, maybe they won\u2019t. The point is the option is always open to them. You have also done the right thing by including your son in the tradition and it being a joyful experience. Your in-laws are the ones showing favoritism by stating your son shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do anything unless his much older siblings do it which is ridiculous. I\u2019m glad your husband stood up for you. Good luck with everything and keep doing what you\u2019re doing!!", "\"I told them I would not make my son miss out just because my stepkids said no.\"\n\nIL's are out of line.

That doesn't mean their no means no for your other child. \n\nNTA.", "Did you feed your step children milk from the bottle or by breast feeding? No well then ILs probably think you should have had Dex wait to do that until the siblings decided to do it. \n\nBut seriously it sucks to be forced to do things you dont want to do and you probably would have just forced the kids away. Dex is at an age where he will do anything you tell him to and he'll figure out what he likes.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat a nutty accusation to throw at you!", "They are shit stirrers. Created drama when there was no conflict  NTA.", "NTA \n\nShe inserted her nose in her son\u2019s business.", "NTA Sounds like some people show favoritism to their bio relatives, and it isn't you.

You can go to the Gym but somebody else exercising aint gonna burn your fat.", "Ding ding ding I have a formative memory of my dad's mom yelling at my mom when I was six years old. I'd had very long hair down to my waist and asked to get it cut off to my shoulders because a girl in my class got a haircut and I thought it looked cool. So my mom took me to the local beauty school and I got a cute little haircut and bangs and I was thrilled.  \n\n\nWe all met up for Easter a few days later and my grandma goes, \"How could you do this to her!!!????!!?!\" and my mom was like, \"My six-year-old asked for a haircut, so I took her to get a haircut. What is there to be worked up about?\"  \n\n\nAnd her problem, of course, had everything to do with her own jealousy of my waist-length, pin-straight hair, and nothing to do with her concern over my mental well-being.", "I\u2019d love to see grandparents reactions if OP starts talking about pulling step-A from dance because B and Dex don\u2019t want to dance and B from sports because Dex is too young and A doesn\u2019t enjoy them. Oh, and no one can go to college until everyone can. \n\nEither the rules apply to everyone or no one, and doing the above  makes as much sense as stopping Dex from cooking. Ie. None at all.\n\nNTA.", "[removed]", "Actually, I think they have this fantasy of all those kids clamouring to be part of this tradition and are upset that it isn't this magical thing the stepkids are dying to be part of. \n\nRather than accepting the boundary the stepkids have set, OP 's parents blaming OP for their feelings being hurt, since they know it would sound crazy to be angry directly at the stepkids. Their behaviour sounds like typical narcissistic parents who expect the whole family to comply with their wishes.", "What they said.\n\nAlso this tradition of your family's is so sweet.", "EXACTLY. My family had a similar tradition. For decades, the boys weren't included, because they just assumed they wouldn't want to. But the second one of my cousins expressed interest, he was included and absolutely loved it. My kid and I observe the family baking holiday, and he loves it, too.", "U/unable_influence3547 please look at the above comment! Super helpful imo.", "I would add:\n\n\"They have been invited to join this tradition.  The invitation remains open, if they are interested, and they are and will be welcome to join in, should they want to.  It is, however, an invitation, not a command, and I will not force them to participate if they are not interested at this time, nor deny other family members the chance to participate because they are currently choosing to decline this invitation.\"", ">She said it twice and mentioned it a few times in the post.\n\nThe first time she mentioned was before the cooking tradition was brought up to show that before this, they've shown no interest in joining in family things. So I don't think it's unreasonable to assume that the reason they don't want to join this activity is bc of the same reason. It also makes sense that if they don't view OP as family, they wouldn't be interested in taking part in OP's family traditions. Like, sure, *could* it be bc they're not interested in cooking? Yeah, but if this is just another example of a pattern of behavior of them not participating in family events, that seems to be the more reasonable conclusion. \n\n>It\u2019s not like they are cooking all the time and don\u2019t have interest in the cook book.\n\nI don't know if this is worded weirdly or something, but I don't really understand what you're trying to say. Is they the stepkids? Bc they quite clearly *don't* have an interest in the cookbook, as expressed by them multiple times.", "Exactly.
