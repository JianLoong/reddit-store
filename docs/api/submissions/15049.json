Despite being so young I had very vivid and treasured memories of my mom and did not take to my dad dating a year after her death well. My dad recognized that he knew this would be hard for me but said that as the parent/adult he knew what was best even if it didn't seem that way at first and that he'd thank me in the long run. Not long after that he married my stepmom \"Lucy\" and when I began to act out over it my dad said that parenting alone was hard and that my sister \"Jessica\" (28f) needed a mom. My dad even got my maternal grandparents to tell me that everything would be fine and how I needed to be a \"good boy.\"\n\nThat was enough to get me to behave during the wedding but once Lucy moved in and started redecorating I started acting out again. My dad had had enough and just started punishing me whenever I acted out or made Lucy upset as well as used the \"Jessica isn't acting out like this\" and to be honest Jessica was easily pleased and wasn't alive long enough to have the same attachment to our mom as I did. It really upset me when Jessica started calling Lucy \"mom\" and it really ticked me off when Lucy started referring to me as her son. I always corrected it when she tried that around me.\n\nIt got worse when I was 8 and Lucy had her own kids because then my dad and her started pushing for adoption. Jessica, obviously, had no problems with it but I refused. My dad had my maternal grandparents come in again and tell me that adoption wouldn't be that bad but I still refused. Lucy and my dad pushed for the adoption anyway but thankfully the judge listened to my feelings in a private room and denied it. After that therapy started but it didn\u2019t last so they also tried the \"since you don't want to be a part of THIS family you don't get X or you can't come do Y\" but I was too stubborn for that method to work on me.\n\nThe only one who I felt was on my side was my paternal aunt who kept sticking up for me whenever she'd see what Lucy and my dad were trying to do, so when I turned 18 I went straight to her. It was when I became a legal adult that my maternal grandparents confessed that they were never O.K. with the situation but my dad threatened to keep me and my sister away if they didn't show support. I was furious, so furious that I had my surname legally changed to my mom's maiden name as I wanted nothing to do with my dad and only ever really talked to my paternal aunt.\n\nFast forward to now and my grandma has passed away (grandpa died in 2020) and according to their will only their legal grandchildren is to split a $250,000 inheritance and since Jessica is legally Lucy\u2019s daughter all she got was a framed photo of my mom and a letter. Jessica doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair and thinks I should share but I told her to get money from her legal grandparents. My aunt thinks I\u2019m being a bit harsh so AITA?\n\nETA: Because someone asked.\n\nIt had been two years since the last time she'd spoken to either of my grandparents while she frequently called and interacted with Lucy's parents. Jessica was never close to my mom's side of the family because she'd rather spend time with Lucy's family and/or didn't want to hurt their feelings.\n\nETA 2: Again since someone asked.\n\nWhen Lucy moved in she and my dad took down all of my mom's pictures and got rid of her things. I wasn't allowed to keep any pictures in my room and I would catch heat if I tried to celebrate my mom's birthday, mourn on the anniversary of her death, and get punished if I didn't celebrate Mother's Day the way Lucy wanted me too. So yeah, she wasn't this saint of a woman who stepped in when my mom couldn't to me.  \n\n\nETA 3: Because I'm starting to see the same thing  \n\n\n1. I don't blame Jessica for choosing to be adopted (now). I'm anger at her belief that she should get any money from my grandparents despite never showing an interest in having a relationship with them once she was 18+. They reached out numerous times but she never bothered yet has the belief that she's entitled to their money? That is what ticked me off.\n2. My mom had a sister who also had kids, I'm not getting the full $250,000.\n3. No I don't expect anyone from Lucy's side to leave me anything nor would I demand Jessica to share. It would be completely hypocritical.

Sounds fair to me.", "NTA, and I'm sorry for what you went through with all that. \n\nOthers have chimed in with their thoughts, but I'll add mine as well. Your grandparents worded the will in a very specific way. It was their choice how their money was divided, and that choice was that it should go to you. It's not unfair for Jessica to ask, but also she and everyone else have to respect the decision of your grandparents and you. If she wants to blame anyone, she can blame them for excluding her in the first place.\n\nBut overall, it absolutely sounds like they were trying to look out for you, knowing you would likely get nothing from Lucy and your dad.

Children have the capacity to love more than two parents. \n\nBut now your sister is an adult.  She's learned that her grandparents were blackmailed into coercing you both to be adopted.  She hadn't seen your grandparents in two years by her own choice. Her choices are hers to own. \n\nDo not share with her. Your grandparents didn't have to leave her anything.  Now she's their grandchild now that money is involved.

Insane to me they worked to erase your mother", "I agree with some of the others on here.  \n\nYour grandparents don't expect your dad to leave you anything because he has been an abusive arsehole to you as you would not do what he wanted.  \n\nThis is their way of making things equal as they expect your sister to inherit from dad, dad's parents and Lucy's family.\n\nIt is abusive to punish a child in any way for celebrating their dead mom's birthday or mourn on the anniversary of her death or for not celebrating mother's day for someone who is not their mother the way she demands they do.", "I think all the adults in your life were assholes, except for maybe your aunt. Without knowing way more information, I can\u2019t really judge beyond that. \n\nYou wrote that Jessica didn\u2019t maintain a relationship with your grandparents but if she\u2019s around Lucy\u2019s family more it\u2019s natural that she would be more involved with that family. Often as a child, you don\u2019t have a choice or your choice is heavily influenced by the adults in your life. \n\nFor example, If she sees Lucy as a mom but knows she\u2019s not her real daughter she might have felt obligated to choose Lucy\u2019s family or Lucy could be feeding her misinformation about your grandparents.\n\nNo way of knowing what your dad and step mom were telling her especially since your dad was basically blackmailing your grandparents. Doesn\u2019t sound like he liked them too much, 100% an asshole move on his part. \n\nThey were also probably influencing Jessica\u2019s relationship with you. \n\nJessica was way too young to remember your mom or make a choice about being adopted, even if she said yes. \n\nI find it a little petty of your grandparents to leave a picture and a letter to her and specifically leave her out of the will by saying \u201clegal.\u201d It\u2019s like they are punishing her for a choice she didn\u2019t even make. She didn\u2019t choose to be adopted, she was too young.

That would be a question to ask a lawyer, if you are worried about it. \n\nYour dad and stepmother should have made sure you had consistent, quality therapy to help with the blending of families and grief from losing your mom. They should never have withhold family activities or anything else. That was wrong of them. Along with probably a lot of other things they did. It sounds like a horrid environment for you. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t gone to therapy since you were a child, you should go. You understandably still sound really angry and bitter about all that happened. That\u2019s not healthy. \n\nEdit to add: just because you had a bad experience with what sounds like an unethical therapist as a child doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t have a good experience now. Look at reviews and look for someone who deals with childhood trauma and grief.", "NTA, your grandmother is allowed to leave her money to who ever she wants and no one is entitled to inheritance that was not left to them. Especially if it is someone they've made very little effort keeping in contact with. \n\nThat being said, I would maybe talk this out with your sister. She maybe had a very different experience with this, being younger than you, but her actions have been heavily manipulated by your father and Lucy. She was what, only 6(?) When she was given a \"choice\" to be adopted. That's not to say you owe her any money, but it is disingenuous to suggest she had the ability to decide not to be your grandparents legal grandchild when she was so young.", "NTA - no one is entitled to money and your grandparents clearly worded the will according to their wishes. \n\nBUT your sister agreeing to the adoption was a natural consequence of your father and step mothers behaviour and how young she was when your mum died. Be angry at your dad and stepmum but not at her. It\u2019s likely that your fathers focus on his \u2018new\u2019 family affected any chance of a bond forming between your grandparents and sister particularly if all evidence of your mum was removed from the house.\n\nI know you have had a bad experience of therapy thanks to the emotional abuse inflicted on you growing up but there are good therapists out there.

Is that correct?\n\nIf so, it seems like ESH (except your sister). Your dad and stepmom are obviously wrong for treating you poorly and trying to force a relationship. Your grandparents are not wrong for giving you an inheritance and you aren't wrong for keeping it, but both you and your grandparents seem to be heavily blaming your sister for accepting her stepmother into her life and y'all seem to view the adoption as an explicit rejection of bio mom + grandparents, when it isn't. All of y'all seem to be taking the worst possible course of action to let anybody heal and move on from this in a healthy way.", "Need more information. Are both of your parents toxic and abusive?

NTA", "Based on the information provided, it is difficult to determine whether or not you are the asshole in this situation. It is understandable that you feel hurt and betrayed by your father and stepmother's actions, especially when they tried to force adoption on you. It is also understandable that you feel entitled to your grandparents' inheritance, as they were your blood relatives and you have maintained a closer relationship with them than your sister has.\n\nHowever, it is important to consider the impact of your decision on your relationship with your sister. She may feel hurt and rejected, particularly if she did not have a say in her adoption and did not choose to be legally separated from your family. It is also worth considering whether or not your grandparents would have wanted their inheritance to be split between all of their grandchildren, regardless of legal status.\n\nUltimately, the decision to share your inheritance with your sister is up to you. It may be worth discussing the situation with a neutral third party, such as a therapist or mediator, to help you make a decision that is fair and balanced.", "NTA for taking your anger out on your father and stepmom, its quite clear they were trying to force these changes onto you but I'd argue YTA towards your sister.", "YTA, as well as your dad and your grandparents.

It's the exact opposite of that.

Despite being so young I had very vivid and treasured memories of my mom and did not take to my dad dating a year after her death well. My dad recognized that he knew this would be hard for me but said that as the parent/adult he knew what was best even if it didn't seem that way at first and that he'd thank me in the long run. Not long after that he married my stepmom \"Lucy\" and when I began to act out over it my dad said that parenting alone was hard and that my sister \"Jessica\" (28f) needed a mom. My dad even got my maternal grandparents to tell me that everything would be fine and how I needed to be a \"good boy.\"\n\nThat was enough to get me to behave during the wedding but once Lucy moved in and started redecorating I started acting out again. My dad had had enough and just started punishing me whenever I acted out or made Lucy upset as well as used the \"Jessica isn't acting out like this\" and to be honest Jessica was easily pleased and wasn't alive long enough to have the same attachment to our mom as I did. It really upset me when Jessica started calling Lucy \"mom\" and it really ticked me off when Lucy started referring to me as her son. I always corrected it when she tried that around me.\n\nIt got worse when I was 8 and Lucy had her own kids because then my dad and her started pushing for adoption. Jessica, obviously, had no problems with it but I refused. My dad had my maternal grandparents come in again and tell me that adoption wouldn't be that bad but I still refused. Lucy and my dad pushed for the adoption anyway but thankfully the judge listened to my feelings in a private room and denied it. After that therapy started but it didn\u2019t last so they also tried the \"since you don't want to be a part of THIS family you don't get X or you can't come do Y\" but I was too stubborn for that method to work on me.\n\nThe only one who I felt was on my side was my paternal aunt who kept sticking up for me whenever she'd see what Lucy and my dad were trying to do, so when I turned 18 I went straight to her. It was when I became a legal adult that my maternal grandparents confessed that they were never O.K. with the situation but my dad threatened to keep me and my sister away if they didn't show support. I was furious, so furious that I had my surname legally changed to my mom's maiden name as I wanted nothing to do with my dad and only ever really talked to my paternal aunt.\n\nFast forward to now and my grandma has passed away (grandpa died in 2020) and according to their will only their legal grandchildren is to split a $250,000 inheritance and since Jessica is legally Lucy\u2019s daughter all she got was a framed photo of my mom and a letter. Jessica doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair and thinks I should share but I told her to get money from her legal grandparents. My aunt thinks I\u2019m being a bit harsh so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

IDK.\n\nObviously dad/stepmom suck. Jessica was too young to be held responsible for the adoption choice. Just like you were too young to be held responsible if you'd acquiesced. Your maternal grandparents would have maybe given to both of you if you had? I applaud your young stubbornness, but that was never your responsibility.\n\nUltimately, it's your grandmother's will.

I\u2019m an adult, my \u201cparent\u201d died 3 years ago and if you told me a year was enough to grieve I\u2019d say and do things to your face that would get me banned if said.

Actions and decisions have consequences, especially those made during adulthood.

Even if the grandparents had just said \"grandchildren\", an attorney advising the executor would say that OP is the only heir through their daughter (OP's mom). And a competent judge would agree. Legally, if Lucy's parents leave a will saying \"per stirpes to grandchildren\" Jessica gets a share equal to her *legal* full-siblings (biological half-sibs).

Your sister is not the villain.\n\nIn terms of the now though your sister actually does have a potential Avenue of contesting the will (I'm a lawyer) and if she does choose to do that it will also take a lot of time money and effort on everyone else's part to deal with probate.

This is not a healthy way of thinking, and is clearly driving a ton of resentment and anger at your sister for \"choosing\" the bad person instead of your good mom. I would also bet money that this viewpoint is why she's more estranged from your maternal grandparents; if they are *also* obsessed with the idea that your sister rejected them, there's almost no way that she could have a healthy relationship with them where she wants to reach out; you and your grandparents are choosing to reject *her*.", "Then this your answer she made her choice years ago and you have no reason to feel guilty", "The answer to that question depends on him wanting or not wanting to be an AH.", "It's not really about the money, it was her family's legacy - which would have gone to her daughter had she been alive, and which she would likely have passed onto her TWO children. Deliberately cutting one out because the grandparents and son fell out with the father is petty, beyond belief. And I'm guessing it would have been totally against her dead daughter's wishes.\n\nI'm a mum, I would never punish my children for getting over my death and being happy. I would also be sad if they weren't able to move on and be happy again. But either way, I would be very angry if anyone else in my family punished any of them allegedly on my behalf for nothing. That's disgusting.", "And that\u2019s her fault?  She was a very young child at the time of adoption. She was lied to and made to feel that she could have a mom and grandparents. \n\n\nI\u2019m willing to bet that the grandparents who are willing to punishing her after their deaths also showed their golden child grandson favoritism, because he \u201cchose correctly.\u201d", "Dad was a dick, but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that the sister was lied to to make her believe it was okay with the grandparents. Their will punishes her, 20 years later, for something she chose as a child, probably 6-8 years old at the time. \n\n\nThey suck for that, not for the lie.

I can guarantee she won\u2019t.", "[deleted]", "I will say that your sister was very young and likely doesn't remember your mother at all. All she has ever known is your step-mother.\n\nAlso, if your dad didn't encourage a relationship with your sister and your maternal grandparents, I'm sure it would be hard for such a relationship to be cultivated and it's hard to start one as an adult if you've never had one as a child.\n\nSo I think that you shouldn't blame your sister for any of this. Blame your dad and step-mom. Your sister was basically influenced by them to do what they wanted and she was too young to make any real decisions.", "[deleted]", "Don't listen to that person, OP.

They're still genetically related.", "She was 8 if my math is right. Do you really think that an 8 year has the ability to understand the weight of your fathers manipulation and or what being adopted really meant in that context. She never had a mom and now she was getting one. She was probably brainwashed because she didn't have a mind of her own when Lucy came around. You had the advantage of knowing better. I know what you went through sucks and I totally understand not trusting therapy especially since I had several shitty therapists as a kid and in my teens. But maybe it's time to look into some sort of talk therapy to help you cope with these feelings. Your anger at your sister is misplaced. She probably was never allowed to feel close to your grandparents and honestly it was their responsibility to try to have a relationship with her once she turned 18. They should have explained to her what they did to you and it may have changed their relationship as well. It sounds like she was shunned for making that choice as a child who knew no better.

Although if I could see it happening if she was to reverse the adoption.\n\nQuoting OP here, it seems less like she hasn't made an attempt to see them and more like the grandparents cut her out of their lives for being adopted by the stepmom; him and his grandparents seem obsessed with her being \"legally\" unrelated to them because they view her adoption as a rejection of the bio mom and grandparents.", "If they didn't see her as a grandchild then thats despicable of them tbh. She was three when their daughter died, to write her off because of decisions that were essentially her fathers is awful. \n\nIf I ever thought that my parents would look at my children as less than because of the way they were raised once I'm dead, for chosing to live and be happy and have a mother figure when I couldn't be one I'd be utterly disgusted with them.

That\u2019s totally fine, and she has been an adult long enough that it\u2019s no longer on her parents. She had no interest in her bio grandparents until they passed and left behind money. They even left her a picture of her bio mom in the will, so if they wanted her to have more than that, they certainly would have made it clear.

Grandparents don\u2019t have a right to resent her for what her dad did when she was a kid, but they absolutely have the right to give their money/belongings to whomever they see fit after they passed. This would be a different situation if the grandparents passed when OP and sis where underage and the money was in a trust or something of the sort, but the \u201cshe was just a kid\u201d thing goes out the window because there was enough time afterwards to try and forge a relationship IMO.", "What is \"murky\" about the term legal grandchildren?", "I wanted to be sure that wasn\u2019t an assumption and a general \u201cJessica should have this when I die\u201d before I answered. \n\nSince if it is by Last Will & Testament we can assure OP that the moral decision has already been made, as well as the legal decision.\n\nGrandparents may well have taken into consideration that Sister will theoretically inherit from Adoptive- Grandparents, Adoptive-Mum and [Bio] Father.

Well, what if the same thing was happening to your sister? Willing her a picture of your mom seems like their version of trying to force you to treat your stepmom as \"mom\".", "Nah, I just think that this one is interesting pretty much *because* OP is in the right about the specific question of inheritance while everything surrounding it is so screwed up. Like, he's not wrong for keeping the inheritance, but it seems very much like the whole screwed up situation resulted in different forms of trauma and loss for both him and his sister (him more than her, obviously).", "Both grandparents and OP are trying to stick it to the sister by clinging to the \"legal\" grandchildren phrasing. They didn't just write - we leave it to our grandson - they (according to OP) deliberately wrote it in such a way as to show disapproval of his sister's love of her stepmom. Pure AH move. You better believe there was plenty more of that when they were alive.", "Putting someone in your will you want to disinherit is a way of making sure they can\u2019t say they were just forgotten.\n\nThe way they worded it, \u201call legal grandchildren\u201d was a fuck you to his sister for a choice she made when she was a child. His grandparents are assholes. That\u2019s why it\u2019s ESH. \n\n\nOP, if he actually loved his sister and wasn\u2019t full of anger, could easily split the money with her. But he wants to punish her, too. \n\nThe whole family sucks.", "Petty because they knew what leaving money to only one of them would do.", "He says in the post, after he turned 18 his maternal grandparents admitted they were against the adoption. If they told the children their real feelings Dad of the year threatened to cut them out of their late daughter\u2019s children\u2019s lives.", "I understand where you are coming from now. And I agree their dad and stepmom done some mature damage to them and thier relationship.\n\nIt amazes me that people can choose so walk away from their grandparents, or parents and everyone cheers them on. But the minute money is involved they think they should get their fair share.\nSorry you didn\u2019t want them in your life for whatever reason why do you think your entitled to their money.", "But again she choose to not have a relationship anymore, according to op grandparents were blackmailed into supporting the decision and then they tried to maintain a relationship but she didn\u2019t want too, so again why does she want their money if she didn\u2019t want anything to do with them?", "I agree this whole situation is fucked and the family sucks. But I just reread the post, grandparents encouraged OP to go through with the adoption, saying \u201cit wouldn\u2019t be bad\u201d but OP refused. Luckily for him a judge did not allow it to go through. If that had not happened, I wonder if the wording of the will would have been the same and OP would have been cut out as well, or if his sister would have been namely cut out. I don\u2019t think this has anything to do with the decision she made as a child, if it did, then grandparents are 100% TA. I think it has to do with the fact that she is a grown ass 28 year old woman and continued not to have a relationship with them. We don\u2019t currently have the info to know for sure. \n\nAdditionally, I don\u2019t think your argument of \u201cif OP actually loved his sister and wasn\u2019t full of anger he could easily split the money\u201d plays here. Who knows if sister even loves OP, it seems like they had a very rocky family life. Unfortunately, blood does not equate love, as we see in the will. To me it seems like sister wants money from people she hardly knew because her brother got some and \u201cit\u2019s only fair\u201d. \n\nI pose the questions to you again, would expect to receive a large sum of money in a will from someone you actively did not try and have a relationship with? Would you write someone who essentially tried to replace your existence with a new family into your will? This is far more complex then \u201cshe\u2019s your sister you should split it because you are supposed to love each other\u201d because it doesn\u2019t seem like OP\u2019s family took kindly to him not accepting the new mom.\n\nEDIT: typo and add my judgement is still NTA. But we need more info", "What is that exactly? From my perspective it seems like they were worried what the Dad, who has a history of punishing their grandchild, would do once they were gone. The sister still gets to inherit from 2 set of families while OP has one", "Yet again, chose is a strong word given the grandparents, and yet again not relevant to OPs being an AH. OP is an AH for (joining his grandparents in) punishing his sister for loving their stepmom, which is all that this is about.", "I would expect grandparents to be fair, yes. I would expect them to treat the children of their dead daughter equally, because it would be what she would have wanted, whether they liked the sister\u2019s choices or not. \n\n\nI don\u2019t have much of a relationship with my brother\u2019s kids, but I\u2019d never leave everything to my sister\u2019s kids and only leave his kids a book. I\u2019d distribute it evenly or give it all to charity.", "They knew it would drive a further wedge between the siblings. I\u2019m sure there always was one, because OP is bitter as hell and definitely holds a grudge against his sister.", "It seems some new info has come to light and that the grandparents are in fact assholes. I\u2019m going to change my judgment to ESH. Money split is dependent on relationship with sister at this point. If she was a jerk to him because he didn\u2019t want to accept new mom then there\u2019s no reason to split the money, if they have a good relationship despite that he should absolutely cut her in. Either way I think OP needs therapy. I think in terms of the will it depends on relationships, for example, I have an uncle who stole from countless family members including myself. That\u2019s something that warrants being written out of a will, if it\u2019s just some petty bullshit then it should absolutely be rectified.", "You're sure based on what exactly. You are just making up scenarios that suit your argument that are not proven in the post. What we know for certain is that after the mother died, the father decided to marry soon after and then removed any memory of of the mom in the house. In addition, he then blackmailed the grandparents into supporting him by threatening to stop them seeing the kids. He then tried to force adoption and was only stopped by the courts. Furthermore he punished OP for not getting adopted by excluding them from family events and activities. None of the facts laid out show the father to be anything but an AH who tried to erase the biological mother from the kids lives. \n\nThe kids are now adults and only one of them has maintained a relationship with the grandparents and therefore only one of them is inheriting. This makes perfect sense to me. However, you are making up hypotheticals about how the grandparents are actually in the wrong here.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give her a dime. It\u2019s your money. Let them think what they want. That\u2019s all irrelevant now. Your dad and step mom are huge AH for not allowing you as a child to honor your mother\u2019s memory.", "NTA - this warmed my heart tbh, I love how you stuck to your guns.", "NTA, But the things that you are complaining about are not Jessica's fault. I think the real question here is, what would your grandparents intention have been? \n\nAlso, if you do not share the inheritance, you can be sure that your father will cut you out of his will.  But it may be worth it if you're getting half of $250,000", "NTA. I'd bet you 250k if Jessica inherited money from Lucy's parents you wouldn't get a dime.", "That whole thing isn't needed. Granny left x to you. X is yours. If Granny wanted to leave to certain others, she would have.", "Nta. I don\u2019t think she should be punished for being a child and accepting a woman as her mom when she probably barely remembers your mom if at all. But if she didn\u2019t try to keep a relationship with them as an adult, she shouldn\u2019t expect an inheritance.", "NTA, you stayed loyal to your mother. The inheritance is yours.", "The grandparents did what they did without OP\u2019s knowledge. He is in no way responsible for what they did to the sister so he shouldn\u2019t be punished for their decision. Right, wrong or indifferent, it\u2019s done. NTA", "NTA - your sister was too young to get attached to your mother, she bonded with her stepmother and stepmother's family and neglected her relationship with her mother's family. \nThere's nothing more to add. \n\nYour father is a mofo for trying to erase your mother from your life. I understand why you resent the three of them. \n\nUse your money wisely, don't share it with them. \n\nGotta say, your maternal grandparents must have suffered a great deal when their daughter's existence was being removed from your life.\ngg grandma!", "NTA. She is in complete right to choose Lucy over a mother she barely remembers but then she can't get money. She gotta wait until Lucy's parents pass away", "NTA. You're not getting the full amount as it's being split amongst you and your cousins. Jessica had no contact with them for a couple years. And it was specifically for \"legal grandchildren\". Meaning they deliberately left her out of the will. You owe her nothing.", "Keep in mind his grandparents worded it that way for a reason.  They chose for the will to be handed out this way and it should stay that way. If he chooses to give her money that's his decision", "NTA, she didn't care about them. But she definitely cares about their money. Keep it for yourself and put it to good use. That's the money your mothers family left to take care of you. Good luck", "NAH about the money.\n\nThe way I see it, you\u2019re probably not going to end up in Lucy\u2019s parents inheritance, and possibly even your dad and Lucy\u2019s inheritance. For this reason, I don\u2019t think you should be expected to share the inheritance, especially because Jessica will probably be accomodated for on both fronts, whereas you might not. \n\nBut your grandparents are blatantly punishing Jessica for choosing to be adopted, which is really harsh, and she kinda has the right to feel slighted about it. She was 3 when her mom died\u2026.the only woman who she can remember being a mother to her is Lucy. It\u2019s reasonable that she would agree to be adopted. It\u2019s also reasonable that she\u2019d be close to Lucy\u2019s parents\u2026because Lucy and your dad actively fostered that relationship/probably brought Jessica to them a lot for holidays and things like that. Even if her relationship lessened with your grandparents after she turned 18\u2026there was still presumably 18 years of them acting as her grandparents growing up. She essentially has three sets of grandparents, and she has a right to feel really slighted that one set specified their \u201clegal\u201d grandchildren in the will as a direct \u201cfuck you\u201d to her for being adopted by Lucy.\n\nYou\u2019re kind of an asshole for telling her it\u2019s because she \u201cchose to be adopted,\u201d because it\u2019s shitty to reinforce that she deserved this for choosing to be adopted. If your dad and Lucy left you out the will, it\u2019d be shitty because your dad is still your dad, and it would  be pretty shitty if Jessica smugly told you \u201cWell, you chose not to be adopted\u201d wouldn\u2019t it?", "nta but your grandparents sure are. they literally told you and your sister to accept your new step mom, but now no longer considers your sister a grandchild ..she was too young to understand and this is held against her like she made some terrible choice. that\u2019s extremely shitty behavior.", "Look, you lost your mom at a traumatic time and had difficulties processing it especially with how your dad handled it. But are you really that blockheaded to think that your sister who is two years younger than you had the same cognitive ability as you did when making the adoption decision? Most kids can\u2019t form memories before 3, so she simply didn\u2019t have the same memories or connection to your mom. And because she made that decision at the age of 5 without your same connection you are willing to vilify her? Cmon man. Why do you think you can drive at 16 but not at 14? You haven\u2019t developed the same cognitive ability yet. And when you both had to make the decision, you had lived 40% more life than from her perspective. You would be obtuse not to acknowledge that. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for following the grandparents will - it\u2019s sad that she didn\u2019t feel the same connection to your grandparents. But you are definitely the asshole for misdirecting the blame that should squarely be on your dad to your sister. She\u2019s your blood, man.

Whether you care about them or not is the question.", "NAH, you're following their wishes, but I can kinda understand why Jessica might be hurt. I don't think anyone really did anything wrong. Sorry about your grandma.", "I think blaming your sister for seeing Lucy as her mom and \"choosing\" to be adopted isn't fair. Your father and stepmother are definitely AHs, but I think your grandparents are too, for punishing your sister over something she didn't control.

(Source, I\u2019m a mom of adult kids.) She probably would be glad there was a mom figure in her kids\u2019 life. I\u2019d give Jessica something, like a few thousand, out of respect for your mother. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "ESH. Except you sister. She was raised by Lucy completely, she is her mother. Holding a grudge against her because she doesnt remember your birth mother is quite ridiculous, and the fact that it has persisted until now 25 years later shows that you still have a lot of maturing to do. Your feelings towards your father and Lucy are completely justified though, their actions after your moms death and how they used family against you to try and pressure you was super fucked up, its definitely why you are so maladjusted with your relationship with your sister.\n\nI think you need to think long and hard about why your aunt, who is quite clearly the only adult in your life who is well put together, thinks you are being too harsh.", "Um your sister is still your grandparents grandchild. And she was a lot younger than you when you lost your mom. Sorry for your loss. It\u2019s not wrong for her to want a mom. Im not particularly happy with your description of the forced bonding with your step-mom. That really never works. Not that your dad shouldn\u2019t have married her or even considered your feelings on getting married as that\u2019s never a place for a child. He should have not forced the bonding nor remove your mom from your memory. Things would have been a lot different if they allowed you to grieve properly and allow you to bond with your step mom on your own. You and your sister experienced the same thing but at different developmental stages. She\u2019s not wrong and neither are you. I would have to say that you would be the AH in this case. You made it clear how you see things and what path you chose to walk on. That doesn\u2019t erase her from being your grandparents, grandchild.", "Ok so a few things here. Firstly you seem incredibly immature and I had to genuinely do a double take at the end to check your age because the post is like one written by a sixteen year old.\n\nSecondly in instances where a child is adopted by someone such as a stepmother then grandparents rights can actually be established in the courts for things like visitation. Also your grandparents treated her like theirs, even if they didn\u2019t have a great relationship, for their whole lives. My thoughts would be that if the will were to be contested by your sister then she would have a decent chance of success. \n\nYou seem incredibly bitter that your sister who has only ever known one mother chose to be adopted by her, which on the face of it seems like a good thing. You pride yourself on acting out against Lucy and hating her referring to you as her son even though legally she was acting as your parent. Jessica was SIX when she showed an openness to be adopted by the only mother she\u2019s ever known and you clearly still hate her for it. That\u2019s genuinely one of the weirdest things I\u2019ve ever seen. \n\nHas it ever occurred to you that your grandparents were actually ok with it but then out of spite to your dad afterwards they said they weren\u2019t? That\u2019s a distinct possibility. You say that Jessica got a framed photo of \u2018my\u2019 mom but utterly fail to see that \u2018my\u2019 mom was also Jessica\u2019s mom. Legal adoption after the death of a parent is very different to people who are adopted through the system so to speak. \n\nESH apart from Jessica, but especially you.

It sounds awful.\n\nNow, on to the ethical part of this.  You knew your grandparents.  Would it have been their wish for the inheritance to go to just you, or to be split?  If this was just an accidental legal loophole, then ethically you should split it.  Now, if they purposely worded it in such a way and gave specific instructions to ensure only you received it\u2026well then that tells you exactly what you need to know.  Often times in inheritances a nominal amount is given so the other party can\u2019t say they were \u201cforgotten\u201d and try to sue.  Was there a specific clause about the framed picture?

She probably didn\u2019t even understand at that age what they were doing. They literally ensured she wouldn\u2019t remember or know your mom. Your dad and stepmom, along with the encouragement of your grandparents, made it to where the only person she was allowed to know as a mother was her stepmother. \n\nNow to move on to the info we have from you about when you turned 18. When they said they went along with it, you could understand that because you saw the manipulation happening. You remembered your mom and them going along with it felt odd. So this revelation was a happy moment for you. Your sister though didn\u2019t have this. She likely had no memories of her mother, the adults in her life telling her to move on and consider her stepmom her mother, and then she turns 18 and the grandparents try to tell her about the manipulation. You are frustrated about the limited relationship, knowing the manipulation that went on, don\u2019t you think the people who have manipulated your sister for 18+ years into not knowing her biological mother wouldn\u2019t paint the grandparents as crazy? And what seals the deal on everything your dad and stepmom probably told her about your grandparents is their will not claiming her as their grandchild because of a decision she was manipulated into when she was 6. I guarantee the guilt and shaming is still going on. \u201cAre you going to believe them over me? I raised you when I didn\u2019t have to\u201d \u201cThey always hated me and tried to poison me against you.\u201d Your dad and stepmom get to say anything they want about the grandparents now. Also, remember you moved out at 18 and she was there with them alone. Manipulation wouldn\u2019t have stopped at this point. Typically individuals who do this will ramp up their stories when one person leaves and is exposed to the truth. They likely started putting little bits of poison against you and your grandparents frequently to your sister. Even telling her things like, \u201cyour grandparents are going to say they went along with xyz. I don\u2019t know why they would say something so awful.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t think you or your sister are AH\u2019s. As a social worker and someone who was raised by a mother exactly like this, I hope you all can find a place of peace and healing. The adults in your life abused you both based on the information you have given. Neither of you deserved this. Your grandparents were put in a bad situation and went along with it and handled it the way they thought was best. \n\nThere is no right answer to all of this. All I can offer is maybe have an open discussion with her about this. I would encourage a neutral mediator there if you feel comfortable with it. Ask her what was said to her, find out more about her decisions.

The nerve of your dad and his wife to throw away pictures of your mom and not let you remember her on her birthday \ud83e\udd7a You are definitely NTA, but your dad and his wife are huge AHs...", "Or maybe they had given op\u2019s sister a chance and she made it clear she didn\u2019t view them as family so they felt she wasn\u2019t owed anything so they changed the wording.\n\nThe great thing about the wording is if ops ain\u2019t decided to adopt late in life they would not need to update the wording because an adopted grandchild is a legal grandchild.", "It wasn\u2019t just her actions as a child.  She rebuffed the attempts of her maternal grandparents to have a relationship with her as an adult as well.  It\u2019s pretty reasonable not to will her money in that case.\n\nI don\u2019t know what was in the letter they left her, but I don\u2019t think it had to have been spiteful.  It seems like the grandparents always wanted to maintain the memory of their daughter in their grandkid\u2019s lives.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wrong of them.\n\nAs for OP, given the edit and how his parents were treating him, I\u2019m not at all surprised that they drove a wedge between him and his younger sister.  They punished him for mourning his mother on the anniversary of her death!  They were despicable.\n\nThat\u2019s not on Jessica, but it\u2019s pretty natural for distance to grow between OP and her as a result.  OP says he isn\u2019t holding that against her.  I hope that\u2019s true, but it would be human if it\u2019s not.  Given the tension of that history, I\u2019m not surprised that his sister\u2019s entitled demand made OP more angry than it might have in other circumstances.\n\nIt\u2019s also pretty reasonable for him to be angry at her guilt trip of him here.", "Genuine question, I\u2019m not being snarky: what action could your sister taken done at age 18, regarding her already established relationship with her stepmother, once she was at the legal age of \u201cinformed consent\u201d so to speak? She can\u2019t undo the past. \n\nAnd yes, I agree that it was wrong for her to neglect her relationship with your grandparents as an adult but my question is specifically what I asked above. Your other comments say she chose to stop being your mother\u2019s daughter by being adopted but I can\u2019t imagine any small child being able to comprehend that it *might* be construed that way. What did she do wrong besides not making an effort with your grandparents?", "I simply can\u2019t conceive of the cruelty of a surviving parent depriving a child of any photos or remembrances of their deceased parent. There is surely a special place in hell for people like that.", "She was socially their granddaughter - but not legally, depending on the wording.  At least in my state, the adopted out child is not able to inherit property directly if the grandparent passes away intestate, they\u2019re not considered an heir unless specifically bequeathed something by name.", "Honestly, that seems like an incredibly unfair way to treat someone who lost their mom at a young age. Why would it hurt them that their granddaughter was adopted as a little kid? It\u2019s not like she chose Lucy over her biological mother. Her biological mother died, and she was adopted by her stepmother. I can\u2019t imagine seeing that as a betrayal.\n\nI think OP is N T A because of the legal wording, but this is too much for me. The whole family seems to be full of vitriol and resentment.", "Regardless, the sister is asking her to share some of HER portion. Maybe the sister will end up with her own share when the legalities settle or maybe not. But she\u2019s not entitled to split someone else\u2019s share.", "I did see in another post this kind of situation and the adopted sibiling didn't have any rights to the inheritance. I wonder how this would turn out.\n\nNothing brings family together like money!  They never see you, but you have money they are there.", "This response is a bit much. Even without having spoken with a lawyer to confirm terms, it is clear that the sister had no relationship or interest. I am currently helping to take care of my grandmother. My brother, mother, and I work around the clock in shifts to support her every need including mental, physical, emotional, and financial. I know that she has a will and an insurance policy, but I don't know any designations and I have never asked. I do it because I genuinely love and care for my grandmother. I did the same thing with my grandfathers and other grandmother until their passings. I have never received anything for it, nor would I take anything for it. But it entirely pisses me off when family that only calls once a year want to know what they are being left and if they are on any policies. I hope she gets nothing based on the investment in the relationships. She is not part of that family and she can stay out now too.\n\nNTA", "[removed]", "> ~~Just because~~ **Jessica was adopted that does**~~n't~~ **mean that your mother is no longer her legal mother.** ~~Your mother is still on Jessicas birth certificate. Your mother didn't give up her rights or responsibilities in any way-she died.~~ **Jessica is legally** ~~her daughter AND~~ **Lucy's daughter.** ~~She is most definitely a legal grandchild, and you and your cousins need to stop treating her like she isn't.~~\n\nFTFY. \n\nThis is a huge paragraph of mis-information.\n\nDepending on the state, adoption of a child essentially rules them out in the case of inheriting from a biological relatives estate unless they\u2019re explicitly included in the will. \n\nThe amended birth certificate and the one that Jessica would receive would in-fact list Lucy as her mother. Not her Biological mother. In the event that OP\u2019s dad and Lucy would\u2019ve divorced when they were kids, Lucy would be entitled to custody of Jessica and/or support orders for Jessica as well. \n\nOP and the cousins are 100% correct and in the right for consulting an attorney on this. Especially if Jessica and/or Lucy feel the need to try to sue for a portion of the $250k.  Which they\u2019re entitled to do but it\u2019s an uphill battle with minimal contact over the last couple years and the diminished relationship that clearly Jessica and grandma had.", "Once my stepdad adopted me, I was issued a new birth certificate with his name and info instead of my bio dad\u2019s.", "Im sure you read the same site as me but failed to read:\n\n\u201cIn approximately 14 States, if a child is adopted by a stepmother or stepfather after his or her birth parent dies (as long as the deceased parent\u2019s parental rights had not been terminated prior to his or her death), the adopted child\u2019s right of inheritance\nfrom or through the deceased birth parent or any biological relative is unaffected by the adoption.1\nAdoption by the spouse of a birth parent generally has no effect on the right of the adopted child to inherit from or through that birth parent. In 11 States, when a child has been adopted by a stepparent, the child may inherit from either birth parent, depending on the circumstances\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that this seems to be the obvious and ethical way that it should work. It\u2019s clear that in circumstances where someone is adopted by their step parent after their own parent dies should not have an effect to make your dead parents parents legally your grandparents. This is clearly not how adoption law is supposed to work hence why you can get grandparents visitation rights in these circumstances. So legally there is ground to say that these people are Jessica\u2019s grandparents. \n\nSo it seems it would depend on the state. As some have said, the wording of the will is standard and allows for any other grandchildren born after the will is made to inherit. It also allows any secret children to inherit. The wording may not be related to OPs sister as such.", " I raise a fuss if I'm not. It's honestly disgustingly hypocritical to me.", "Except that she was only adopted by the step-mother.  Her father is her bio dad and she was not adopted by him.", "It's probably more that Jessica went no contact with the grandparents as an adult (26 years old and 2 years of NC). Her choice to \"side\" with the new mom is fine. But, she doesn't get to complain when she goes NC and grandparents don't leave her anything.", "She can raise fuss but legally she wouldn\u2019t have legal grounds to stand on if that\u2019s the case and she still contest it ,because let\u2019s face it some lawyers just want your money, if she losses she will have to pay the estates legal fees to defend the state and she have to pay her fees. \n\nOp and his cousins would be out nothing because she would sue the estate not him. The estate has an attorney who probably wrote the will which means he knows every loop hole in the thing. \n\nSo in the end ops sister raising a stink will get her no where just some major legal fees.", "In legal terms the moment she was adopted by the stepmom it severed any legal ties to the grandparents. \n\nIt made ops mother the natural mother not the legal mother it made the stepmom the legal mom. \n\nSo in reality the dad being her bio dad means nothing honestly. But the adoption changes everything about the maternal side. As far as the eyes of the law her step moms family is now her maternal family not the bio moms.\n\nThe wording in the will is what will get her. If it says all bio grandkids, which honestly I don\u2019t think it will, she still have a legal right. But if it says all legal grandkids then she doesn\u2019t because she isn\u2019t a legal grandkid.\n\n\nLook at in term of this way. You have a child with a woman. The woman doesn\u2019t want the child so she signs all her legal rights away. When she does this she is signing all legal rights to the grandparents away. This keeps the grandparent from suing you for visitation because they have no legal rights to that child.\n\nBut intern that keeps you from suing for any legal support.\n\n\nBut the wording in the will is key.\nSimple words like legal and bio in a will change the whole meaning of the will.", "That is my understanding to. So legally the money isn\u2019t hers it\u2019s op\u2019s.", "That's why I said look at the letter. That's the missing piece. It might clarify grandparents feelings.\n\nEither way, it was their decision and OP is under no obligation to give the sister any money. If you cut contact with someone for years, you should have no expectation that they will do anything for you."]}
