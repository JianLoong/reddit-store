It\u2019s about a 12 hour drive and every time that we have gone we have stayed with my mom 61F and brother 24M. My mom and brother bought the house that they currently live in together after my father passed with money he left my mom, and split the mortgage. \n\nMy wife and I both work from home so every time we go we try to spend more than a week there in order to maximize our visit. Our visits have usually gone off without a hitch, except for our last one which caused some lasting drama. My brother is an avid collector and has the basement filled with his stuff. While I was out at dinner with an old friend, my mom volunteered to watch my older son while my wife tended to the baby. Long story short, my son got a hold of some of my brother\u2019s vintage Pok\u00e9mon cards and drew on them. My mom didn\u2019t realize what had happened and it was only revealed the next day at breakfast. This caused my brother to become very angry and he yelled at my wife for being negligent which really upset her and called my son a brat.\nI talked with him about this and let him know that his reaction in front of my kids and wife wasn\u2019t cool, paid him back more than what the cards were worth, and apologized. \n\nI thought that had all blown over, but last week I got a text from him asking us to not stay with them at Thanksgiving or Christmas and to instead get a hotel. His point was that he doesn\u2019t like having kids in his house and that by virtue of him paying half the mortgage he can make that call. He also used this as an opportunity to rant about how messy my kids are, how misbehaved they are, how he doesn\u2019t appreciate waking up early in the morning due to their noise, and how my wife and I don\u2019t watch them at all. I refute this as especially when we are at their place my wife and I are always with them unless someone else is. I also refute the cleanliness argument as my wife and I go above and beyond in cleaning while we\u2019re there, even to the point where she has done his laundry to be nice. \n\nMy wife and I both think that he\u2019s making this a big deal for nothing and do not want to get a hotel. A hotel would be a far drive and around the holidays would end up costing us a lot. I haven\u2019t spoken with my mom about this yet as I know that she would get upset about the situation\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: The majority owner of the house is my mother who has invited us to stay each time we\u2019ve been and wants us to stay for over a week each time as she loves having my kids there \n\nUPDATE: My brother ended up telling my mom that he uninvited us. She called me to tell me that he had no right to do that and that she very much wants us to stay with her. She said she will talk to my brother and come up with a plan. I also plan on calling him and just letting him know, but also to see how we can be more accommodating to him when we stay\n\nFor everyone asking about how the Pok\u00e9mon card situation happened- a stack of them was left on a coffee table in the basement. My mom took my son down there to watch TV. He was coloring and started doodling on the cards. My mom didn\u2019t notice, it was only truly 3 cards that were damaged ", "created_utc": 1699381245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17q0oel/aita_for_not_staying_at_a_hotel_when_i_visit_my/", "score": 508, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How is it on you and your wife that said child did something bad? Yes financially it is your responsibility to replace what was broken but (for lack of a better term) morally your mother was the one who was not observant. How did the kid even get into a vintage Pok\u00e9mon set without grandma noticing? You paid above fair value, but grandma didn\u2019t do her job. \n\nAlso, your brother may pay half the mortgage but the down payment was from your mother. So she put down the bulk of the upfront money (which makes his mortgage payment cheaper) AND pays half the monthly mortgage. To me that\u2019s her putting up well over 50% and therefore she has the trump card in this situation. It\u2019s time to involve mom because it sounds like your brother is trying to put on his big boy pants while mommy ponyed up more money", "&#x200B;\n\na) 4 people for 3 weeks is ALOT, especially since 2 are kids\n\nb) \"my wife and I are always with them unless someone else is\" this doesn't do anything to refute the claim that you and your wife don't watch your kids.  Sounds like you are \"working\" while you are there, so clearly someone else is watching your kids for 40 hours a week.\n\nc) it doesn't matter how much your brother \"owns\" the house, it is his home, it isn't your vacation villa.\n\nd) why not compromise and visit for just one week a year and discuss with your brother what the best week would be.  And then have Mom visit you another time.", "ESH. A week+ visit is a long time, especially with two young kids, and I see why he wouldn't necessarily want to host the whole time. I'm sure your kids are great, but even great kids can be tiring. Is there a compromise available? Perhaps spend a few days at the house and the rest at a hotel or airbnb?", ">My wife and I both think that he\u2019s making this a big deal for nothing and do not want to get a hotel.\n\nI don't think he's making a big deal for nothing for what it's worth. It was good on you to pay him back for the damage done, but sometimes money doesn't solve everything. He was/is probably proud of that collection he had and it's gone.\n\nThat said, he has his opinions and whether some of them are justified or not is possibly up to interpretation. \n\nHe's only got half the mortgage so your mom's opinion does matter. But it sounds like this will cause a lot of contentious problems regardless. To me the hotel sounds like it could appease a lot of issues.", "ESH.\n\nYour brother sucks because it seems like a locked door would solve the bulk of the problem, but then there are a lot of other complaints related to living with young kids for a week. He has decided he won't tolerate and that is his perogative but it's very mean spirited. He is a grinch.\n\nYour mother, very gentle ESH. She should've better supervised the kids on her watch so that they wouldn't violate boundaries that she must have know would be a problem for brother.\n\nAnd you...you can't insist on going where you are only half welcome. Why would you even want to have them somewhere they aren't welcome? Bro has ownership status of his own house so he can veto your invite.\n\nIt's a shame. I would invite your mother to spend the holidays at your place instead.", "All of you need to learn how to compromise because your mother basically told your brother that it doesn't matter that he lives there full time and pays half the mortgage, that house will never truly be his because she has the final say. Is it possible for you to stay with other family members? If your mother isn't willing to try and  compromise i think her relationship with your brother might suffer (and so will yours)", "NAH/YTA (but only slightly). I think you're being a little self-centered on this one. I understand you're used to this arrangement but your brother has every right to not want to host a whole family of four with two small children for over a week. That's a pretty big imposition and while some families may welcome it, your brother has clearly articulated that he doesn't enjoy it and doesn't want it. These are also his holidays and probably his PTO and I can understand if he's frustrated at being woken up early and his things get ruined. It's his house and he's entitled to set boundaries for his space, especially after his property was damaged.\n\nI understand that for you, this may make the trip impossible, and that sucks. But maybe this arrangement isn't the best for everyone anyway. Maybe it's time to change up your tradition and do things differently. Perhaps your brother and mom can fly out to visit your family instead?", "It's not a big deal over nothing. Apparently his unease has been building and the cards was the straw that broke the camel's back. And if you've ever been a collector of anything, it's a huge deal. It doesn't matter if you gave him more than what you thought it was worth, you can't judge him for the value he placed in it or the fact that it's ruined. Forever. YTA.", "I mean I don\u2019t get actually wanting to stay somewhere someone doesn\u2019t want you. \n\nLike what kind of person goes well I know you don\u2019t want me in your home but haha fuck you I\u2019m coming anyway and for weeks not days and I\u2019m bringing babies/children hahaha \n\nNot a genuinely nice good person, regardless of what you think of your brother or what he has to say the person who owns over 50% of the property doesn\u2019t want you there because your children Damaged his stuff and you create mess and lots of noise but it\u2019s easy for you to palm your kids off on everyone else so it\u2019s nice and fun and easy while he hates being in his own home for three weeks.", "YTA.  It's disruptive to their life for all three of you to stay in their house, especially for a week.  Get an Airbnb to avoid resentment and bitterness coming out from these stays", "This one sucks because, while I feel your brother is being unreasonable, it is HIS house. You have to respect that he doesn\u2019t want your family staying with him during the visit. If your mother hasn\u2019t said anything about you being able to come over on her own, putting her in the middle of the situation could also cause unnecessary drama.\n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d plan for a shorter trip with a hotel suite booked for Thanksgiving and maybe offer to fly out your mother sometime after the holidays for an extended stay so your kids still have extra time with their grandma. \n\nNTA", "Well first of all, what is the purpose of even asking the question? Are you going to try and stay in your brother\u2019s house against his will? YTA. Second, dude, you visit three times a year and stay \u201cat least a week\u201d each time?! That\u2019s WAY too much to expect your brother to deal with. Third, it\u2019s patently obvious that your recollection of events is quite one-sided. Yeah, he\u2019s right\u2026get a motel room.", "Hmmm. I think YTA to not consider a hotel. And I think you\u2019re being rude about his feelings about staying at his home for a week+ at a time, that\u2019s very disruptive even if he loved your company. I might feel slightly differently if your kid hadn\u2019t destroyed something of his. Unless all of his space is able to be contained (like, locking the basement or his rooms, or if he had like a wing of the house where his possessions were) and you were very clear that you\u2019ll be in control of your kids at all times, I\u2019d feel wary about having you over too. Obviously cost is a factor but so are his feelings", "Yta. He clearly told you that you don't make your kids mind and he doesn't want you there. Stay at a hotel or don't go. Not everyone thinks kids are great and wonderful and not everyone wants them in their house for extended periods of time.", "NAH. It sounds like your 5 year old and brother share similar interests and maturity levels. Not surprised your mom ended up cleaning both their messes or that your brother felt it was appropriate to lash out at your wife instead of you.\n\nOffer to host at your house. 12 hours driving might enlighten your brother about the effort and money you\u2019re putting in to see them. People who don\u2019t travel never realize the sacrifices you\u2019re making to see them.", "NTA. Your mom was responsible for watching your kid, as she volunteered for it.   \n\n\nBut something is off in family relationship. I can't pinpoint what it is. I remembered when i visited grandma on her house, their were always some beds available for guests. this seems also the case here. I think there is something between you and your brother.   \n\n\nI also can't tell, whats the role of your mother. Also how your son got hold on the cards. It might be that your mother gave him the cards to play, thinking they are just worthless playing cards.", "YTA, If your brother is paying half of the mortgage, he should have a say in who stays.     You ran to mommy complaining instead of doing a 3 way call to discuss this or even sending an email to both to discuss this.   A 2 yo and 5 yo are can be very difficult to live with for more then a few hours at a time if you aren't used to them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am curious/concerned about the \"we are always with them unless someone else is\"   Do you ask if they are ok watching your kids or is this a oh, brother is watching tv so I am going to vanish (with out saying a word) for the next 4 hours, I am sure He won't mind watching them.  I know he has to be to work in an hour, but if he can't find my mom, missing a day of work doesn't matter. Maybe suggest either they come visit you for the holidays occasionally or find an airbnb somewhere fun that you all go stay at.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, when you are with your kids, are you actually monitoring their behavior or just letting them run wild.     Remember, what YOU might find what your little darling is doing cute others may find quite annoying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do go stay with your mom despite y our brothers wishes, I would suggest shortening the visit.", "Pay for the mom to come visit you for the holidays.", "YTA\n\nIt IS his house. He gets to make that call. Just like he\u2019d have to respect if his mom said she didn\u2019t want some of his guests staying there.\n\nCould you imagine having guests at your home and you don\u2019t want them there, and they say \u201ctoo bad so sad\u201d.", "Can your mother visit you in your home for the holidays?", "It doesn\u2019t really matter what you think or want though does it? You\u2019ve been informed you aren\u2019t welcome to stay at your brothers house", "NTA, Send your mom the text.  Just tell her you don\u2019t know what to do or say.  Remind her he doesn\u2019t own the entire house, and if he feels this way and she can\u2019t reason with him, then you won\u2019t be able to visit anymore.  Then tell her you and the kids love her very much and she\u2019s always welcome at your house.  \nJust switch it up.  Your brother won\u2019t ever come to your house, so instead of isolating your mom like he\u2019s trying to do, he will be isolating himself.", "How about grandma comes to your house for the holidays?", "NTA...it seems like a lot of people aren't looking at your comments or what you said. Your mom was watching your son when this went down, but he never went after her. Your brother seems to have a giant beef with your family and wants to stop the visits, and he ran to mommy thinking she'd be on his side for some reason. He may be entitled to some say, but your mom is the majority owner of the property so at the end of the day, I don't think he's being reasonable in demanding you stop staying with them, particularly because it's unreasonable to stay so far away at such a cost. And why isn't he taking steps to protect his things if they are at risk of being damaged?", "I personally think YTA. He lives there. He pays half the mortgage. You stay for at least a week with two young kids. And the fact that you think he is making a big deal for nothing, when some of his collection was ruined by your kid? Really?", "Rent an Airbnb, have your mom come stay with you and leave your brother in his castle, alone. It\u2019s not just his place or call.", "Put a lock on the basement door to keep the kids out.", "Why don\u2019t your mom & brother come to your place?", "YTA. It\u2019s not JUST your moms house, your brother does help pay the mortgage, so how come she gets the right to determine who gets to stay & who doesn\u2019t but your brother can\u2019t make that call? \n\nWould she be able to afford the house on her own if your brother got his own place?\n\nA week is a long time to have people in your home, especially children, when you don\u2019t normally have that kind of chaos going on - 3 weeks would be an absolute no go for me. Especially if I was also paying bills/mortgage\n\n& it\u2019s already been shown that your kids will ruin his things given the chance - like any unsupervised child", "NTA - but just get a hotel and make everyone\u2019s lives easier", "YTA\n\nQuite frankly, you visit too often. We had family come to visit for a week. I love them very much and they were the BEST guests! Unintrsive, always helping to clean and cook. But the introvert in me was exhausted by day 3 & I low-key hate myself for it. They were so lovely but I just could not relax.  I had to fake being sick so at I could stay home alone, decompress & recharge while the rest of my family hung out. I cannot imagine how your brother feels having people in his sanctuary so often.\n\nPlease consider staying elsewhere sometimes.\n\nEdit: you are NTA for the Pok\u00e9mon card situation though. It was an accident and you handled it well.\n\nEdit 2: your brother may not be an introvert bit he has the right to be comfortable in his own home and at peace that his possessions are safe.", "\u201cMy wife and are always with them unless someone else is\u201d is obviously not true. Otherwise the kid wouldn\u2019t have been able to get into your brother\u2019s private things and have time to destroy his collection. If it was your mother\u2019s job to watch him, then she is responsible for the damage and she should apologize and back up the son who helps pay her bills. So unless she can assure your brother that your son will never, ever be out of her sight when you are at their house and nowhere near his property, you and she are TA. \n\nAnd your brother can\u2019t be the one to stay at a hotel because he won\u2019t know if his property is being destroyed by your perfect, never out of sight children. Accept that young children are annoying to people who don\u2019t have any and make the necessary adjustments.", "Info What does your mother think?", "NTA - but I would refuse to go to their house.  If mom wants to see your kids she can fly to your place an stay for a visit.", "YTA. It's his house. It doesn't matter if your mother wants you to stay there. Your insistence on coming anyway is completely inappropriate, literally just as inappropriate as it would be for him to come to your house without your consent, wake you up, and destroy your things.

Obviously someone was negligent during that.", "Yta yta yta yta yta", "NTA (changed from yta) as OP clarified he\u2019s financially reimbursed his brother for the damage", "ESH. I feel your brother's pain. As a child free person having little kids invade your home for more than a week is freaking exhausting. Those 3 cards could've been worth a lot of money especially if they were part of a set. It may not have been a big deal to you, but is to your brother. And it seems like you're just brushing it under the rug. \n\nBrother should've talked with your mom before uninviting you. That's his ahole move. But since they are the shared home owners he should have some say in who is staying and for how long. \n\nWhy don't you fly your mom, give her a plane ticket go get her and drive her back or something, so she can come stay with you for the holidays. Your house is childproofed already and you wouldn't have to lug the kids around. Plus it would be more cost effective for your family.\n\nYou and your family imposing on them for more than a week at a time is your a-hole move.\n\nAgain everyone sucks here.", "YTA. 4 people for a week is a lot. Get an Airbnb.", "NTA - youre not the AH here BUT it is his house.

This issue is between your mum and brother. Why would your mum take a child to your brothers basement when their are collectables in there? It just seems really irresponsible of your mum to do that.  You paid the amount and more, which is the correct thing to do.\n\nYour brother is an AH for having a go at your wife in front of your kids when it was your mother watching the child at the time.\n\nYou're an AH for trying to sweep this under the rug and downplay the situation. The truth is your child unintentially destroyed something of value to your brother. Your brother is allowed to be upset about it. You paid the cost, but it's not always about the money when it comes to collectables. Sentimental value is a thing. Also, having 4 people (2 children under 10) stay at your house for a whole week is a lot. Your brother shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in his own house. Whether you deny it or not, kids are noisey and disruptive. Having an extra 4 people in your space for a week is disruptive. \n\nThat being said, your mother should be allowed to have guests over but this situation is between your mother and brother regarding their house.

It\u2019s about a 12 hour drive and every time that we have gone we have stayed with my mom 61F and brother 24M. My mom and brother bought the house that they currently live in together after my father passed with money he left my mom, and split the mortgage. \n\nMy wife and I both work from home so every time we go we try to spend more than a week there in order to maximize our visit. Our visits have usually gone off without a hitch, except for our last one which caused some lasting drama. My brother is an avid collector and has the basement filled with his stuff. While I was out at dinner with an old friend, my mom volunteered to watch my older son while my wife tended to the baby. Long story short, my son got a hold of some of my brother\u2019s vintage Pok\u00e9mon cards and drew on them. My mom didn\u2019t realize what had happened and it was only revealed the next day at breakfast. This caused my brother to become very angry and he yelled at my wife for being negligent which really upset her and called my son a brat.\nI talked with him about this and let him know that his reaction in front of my kids and wife wasn\u2019t cool, paid him back more than what the cards were worth, and apologized. \n\nI thought that had all blown over, but last week I got a text from him asking us to not stay with them at Thanksgiving or Christmas and to instead get a hotel. His point was that he doesn\u2019t like having kids in his house and that by virtue of him paying half the mortgage he can make that call. He also used this as an opportunity to rant about how messy my kids are, how misbehaved they are, how he doesn\u2019t appreciate waking up early in the morning due to their noise, and how my wife and I don\u2019t watch them at all. I refute this as especially when we are at their place my wife and I are always with them unless someone else is. I also refute the cleanliness argument as my wife and I go above and beyond in cleaning while we\u2019re there, even to the point where she has done his laundry to be nice. \n\nMy wife and I both think that he\u2019s making this a big deal for nothing and do not want to get a hotel. A hotel would be a far drive and around the holidays would end up costing us a lot. I haven\u2019t spoken with my mom about this yet as I know that she would get upset about the situation\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your brother pays half the mortgage- he is literally a co-owner of this house.  When your mom starts needing help with things, he will be the one caring for her, not you. His attitude about you and your family isn't great- but honestly, it has to be even harder to deal with you for an entire week when he is so annoyed by you. \n\nI am of the \" no overnight guests \" ilk myself. I would go nuts if my absolute favorite people in the world were living in my space for a week. My sister who I have had a rocky relationship with my entire life- whoa.
