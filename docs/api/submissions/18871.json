Texting isn't the way to communicate about it. Sending that at 10pm was purposely meant to ruin his evening like you felt yours was ruined, that's asshole behaviour.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  \n\nHe should have been courteous and let you know explicitly when he was coming to your place (or if he had changed his mind). But you're 30 and he's not your emotional support animal.", "ESH.\n\nI think you could have waited to mention that it's important to you that he comes home when he says he's coming home, or send a message to let you know he will be late. Sometimes you're out and about and just having a good time and you want to stay out. Him not messaging you makes him wrong, BUT, you also should have not sent him a message. Waiting and talking it out at an appropriate time would have been best in my opinion. If him coming back late all the time becomes a regular thing just bin him off. Don't see him as the only way of getting into a new place.", "ESH\n\nHe is your boyfriend and not your therapist.  It feels as if you are treating him as a therapist.  That your emotional needs trump all.  \n\nHe failed to communicate his plans of when he would come over.  You failed to clarify at the time plans were made.", "Girl he called you by his ex\u2019s name??? Byeeee listen to the red flags!", "NAH and even though it's not what you want to hear, it's much better to receive this critical information now before moving in with him.\n\nYou're asking for support and thinking your relationship is in a place where he can and should give you emotional support.  You're even thinking of him as a potential partner, someone to take the next step with.\n\nHe's clearly communicating that he is not that person.  He is not going to prioritize you, give you the support you are asking for.  To use an old phrase - he's just not that into you.\n\nYou've asked him and he's answered.  He's telling you who he is.  If you don't listen, if you ignore this clear communication or allow yourself to be placated by a later apology or something, you'll be lying to yourself about this relationship.", "So if I'm reading this right, he expressed a plan to spend time with you, then dropped that plan without communicating to you.  Your way of dealing with it (messaging that you were disappointed in him and then adding more complaints on top) doesn't sound like it was the classiest possible way to go about things.  But it's hard to be classy when you're in distress and the distress does sound warranted.  The phrasing of his reaction is a problem.\n\nI do think you should work on your emotional regulation in the face of stress.  But I'm going to go with NTA.", "Info: how much time do you spend together in a typical week?\n\nIf he routinely blows you off for his friends that's one thing, but going strictly by what you've stated here, you sound a bit controlling/high maintenance.  There was also no need to text him while he was still out, it's not like he was going to be able to immediately drive to you.\n\nEdit: ESH but almost Y T A.  He is an asshole because he said he would be there but wasn't, but you're the bigger asshole for making this a bigger deal than it should be, and for trying to derail his time with his friends instead of waiting until the next day to have a real conversation.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from and how you could feel not supported, but at the same time you don\u2019t have to make him feel like shit because you do. I don\u2019t think this is really an AITA situation it\u2019s more of a you guys should talk it out situation. You were sad, and he was having a good time hanging out with his friends, it\u2019s a pretty common couple problem. Most couples have had this happen before. You can\u2019t destroy him for having some personal time with his friends, but he also can\u2019t be shocked that you\u2019re upset that he wasn\u2019t there for you", "It\u2019s not a surprise that one may get drunk after a brewery tour. It probably wasn\u2019t a good idea for you two to have plans to meet after that. My advice would be to give him a bit of grace understanding that him being drunk after spending the day drinking is understandable. Start fresh today\u2026", "YTA based off your comment that you spend 4 nights/1 full weekend day together and are telling him he doesn't prioritise the relationship. he clearly puts you first and spends most of his time with you. it is important that he has a life outside you and maintains his friendships. this is something you should be encouraging, not dismissing, nor devaluing. it's unfortunate that you had a bad week but his long-standing plans gave you an opportunity to reach out to someone else for support. he didn't specify when he'd be home and it's reasonable to assume he'd be out after a brewery tour. the way you handled your disappointment -texting, messaging while he's with friends- isn't conducive to resolving the issue and comes off like you're selfishly trying to punish/control him. id honestly apologise if i were you but also request more specific communication next time, i.e naming a rough time to expect him home. that's reasonable and fair . it'd also be a good idea to ask for his perspective so he has a chance to explain his feelings and be heard. i hope it works out for you!", "YTA.  He should have communicated better with you to let you know his plans had changed, but I feel like he intentionally didn't communicate with you because he feared your reaction.  \n\nYou're 30 years old, lost your lease and refer to your apartment as your \"safe space\".  You seem neurotic and controlling.", "NTA he should have communicated better", "Let the man be. It's one night.", "Did you want him to drive over while drunk? \n\nI understand you\u2019re going through a lot here, and yes he should be supportive, having said that, you also need to understand the tour was already booked, he too deserves space, and time with his friends, also please realize, that even if he\u2019s there, what can he do about what you\u2019re upset over, besides being supportive? Especially when he\u2019s drunk? If anything, he will not have a good perspective on things because his mind is clouded.   \n\nFrom what I read in your answer, in the comments, you spend a lot of time together, and it could be worse, he could only be there one night a week, but he\u2019s there for 4.. how many times do you go to his place during the week? \nI feel like you texting him kind of pouting (sorry I know you\u2019re upset) was a tiny bit controlling, but I\u2019m not liking his response either. It was a bit rude. You already stated you both have a bit of trouble with communication of emotions. You\u2019re both on a different level there.  If you move in together, which may not happen now, because you may want him home and around you )when he\u2019s not working, ) 24/7 \u2026 it may be a red flag to him that you\u2019re too clingy and needy. People need their own space and boundaries. And I DO understand you\u2019re going through a bad time, and need comforted, let him have some space, and go out with friends without a time limit. You\u2019d not like it if that was done to you.  Try to get some perspective on the situation you\u2019re in, breathe, don\u2019t get involved with the drama at work, (if possible) and best of luck finding a new place. Look at it as a new life for you! \u2665\ufe0f. \n\nSorry for the long post.\nEdited\n\nEdited AGAIN to add I saw your edit and I saw you\u2019re now saying you \u201cdidn\u2019t know where he was going \u201c comment but originally you DID know\u2026 and I feel because you weren\u2019t winning the argument in here you changed it to go in your favor \n\nFor that, I\u2019m changing it to\n\nYTA", "Unpopular opinion...NTA \n\n>in this morning he accidentally called me by his ex girlfriends name.\n\nFor this alone he's an AH \n\n>When I called him at 8 there was a girl who yelled down the phone\n\nHe's also a lying AH\n\nHe has shown that you can't rely on him or his word.\n\nGet a new apartment and a new bf you can trust", "YTA. You get plenty of time with him during the week by the sounds of it with one of your comments, and tell him he's prioritizing friends over you. I'm assuming this means you'd be willing to cancel plans you had with friends to stay home when he's having a rough go? I also think it's a matter of incompatibility. I'm exactly like him and can't stand drama or emotions and don't do well with them at all. It's one of the many reasons I don't date anymore. You have to realize that dumping all those emotions on him then hounding him while he's out with his buddies is going to be exhausting for him. Anyway, sounds like you're not compatible and need someone who is better equipped for your emotional needs, because honestly you sound a little needy.", "Gently, YTA\n\nHe said he wanted to be home with you tonight. It didn't sound like a specific time, and he may well have thought midnight or 1am was fine, he'd be with you all the next day.\n\nI never think it's a good look when a GF is texting \"*where are you*\" or \"*you haven't done X,Y and Z*\" when (a) the GF knows where he is, and (b) he's with friends.\n\nWould you like it if he did that to you when you were out on a planned night out with your GFs? I mean, it's healthy for people in a relationship to have their own friends. If my husband did this to me I'd feel seriously caged and like he doesn't want me to enjoy himself.  The apartment will work itself out, his being with you this moment isn't going to solve that.\n\nI'm sorry you're feeling anxious...but your reaction is yours to control, and if you need extra therapy/meds, then the doctor will be the better call. Also - start looking around for a new place, set up some apartment tours, do something that will solve the problem, rather than stressing that your BF isn't there.\n\nYou have a job, you live independently - you **can** do this.", "ESH, you for scolding him via text and him for his response and, to a lesser extent, his actions. \n\nDid you have explicit plans for him to contact you at X time or be at your place by Y time? If so and if he didn\u2019t follow up, that\u2019s AH behavior.

Does that mean at 42 I'm still slightly young?", "She literally did call? She contacted him and was clear in her communications. He's the one that broke their plans and then made no effort whatsoever to contact her. She is in no way the asshole here.", "In your original post you said you knew what he was doing and where.. why are you changing it?", "She said in her original comment she was told. Now she\u2019s saying she was not?", "Yeah this dude is for the streets.", "She fucking called him asking all that hours before and he still didn\u2019t communicate. So yeah, I think it was the way.", "I read the OP and thought \u201ceither OP moved way too often as a child, or they lived in one house their entire childhood\u201d.  \nI mean, maybe they had an absolute steal for the past five years in a high cost of living area, and they will never find an adorable 2 bedroom craftsman bungalow with a shaded yard for $500 a month\u2026 but if it\u2019s a regular old apartment, it\u2019s a strange reaction for an adult to have, much less bad enough to rope your boyfriend into a pity party over maybe moving in together all weekend.", "So you're not allowed to have sad or anxious feeling about it? \n\nI definitely consider my home my safe place, you don't?", "It\u2019s mY sAfE SpAcE.. you know.. the new buzzword since 2020.. because that whole pesky job thing they were asked to do and did not do then got possibility spoken to about it traumatized them and was bad for their mental health so they wanted to stay home in the safe space or parents home because working was too traumatizing for them.   I\u2019ve seen it in hundreds of posts on here. Literally hundreds, then I get downvoted for speaking on it truthfully and pointing it out..", "I don\u2019t disagree! But read my next comment..", "What? I'm sorry but you have at least $5k ready to go at a moments notice? First, last, and securities, insurances etc? Then have the money to rent a truck and movers to help you move? I'm gonna have to say not everyone is ready for that atcthe drop of a hat.  You make it sound like it's so easy. It's not. Not to mention we don't know anything about her commute. We don't know what she does for a living. Not everyone has a fantastic paying job. Or hell even a good paying job. \n\nThis is a perfectly good reason to feel like it's a crisis. Not to mention she has said she had a horrible week and then found out about this on top. I'm sorry but I am going to disagree with you here.", "Yup. You\u2019re still slightly young! \ud83d\ude09. But when we were 30 we were expected to be well established , confident, and have out stuff together and not make 100 excuses as to why we weren\u2019t together. We never said our job wasn\u2019t good for our \u201cmental health \u201c and would just rather stay home in our safe space.. and not traumatized if our boss asked us to do something at our job, if someone said something we didn\u2019t agree with, \n\nWe learned how to deal with things.. 30 now is definitely different than 30 then. Haven\u2019t you noticed? Look at my downvotes \ud83e\udd23 I can see I\u2019m right because I feel that the truth can\u2019t be tolerated by the helicopter parents in here, and the very people I\u2019m talking about can\u2019t deal with it either. If they wanted to prove me wrong they could discuss it with me on here individually instead of just downvoting me \ud83e\udd23 but hey , I was trying to be kind! If they were here all the time and read a lot of the posts as I have, they\u2019d see I\u2019m not wrong! Oh well. I don\u2019t care about downvotes because everyone my age and older all say the same thing.", "I deleted the comment due to her changing her entire story because the votes weren\u2019t going her way. Very immature and proving my point to a extent and you\u2019re absolutely correct", "I do think though that they should find other people to be with, and she needs someone better equipped for emotional stuff. Most men just aren't wired for that and she recognizes that he isn't in her post. A lot of men, myself included just find it exhausting and can't sit through it. It's not that we don't care about the person, we just can't bring ourselves to be in tune with emotions.", "Generally from years in this Reddit when new information suddenly starts showing up in comments after the OP is getting a negative ruling\u2026I take the new information with a grain of salt.", "Anxious, to a degree, sure.  But there isn't a choice here.  She has to move.  The sooner she accepts that and starts taking steps to find another place to live, the better.  To be crippled emotionally because you are being forced to move is a sign of someone who isn't well-adjusted.  Life happens.  To DEMAND that her boyfriend be at her side during her pity party is nonsense.", "I don't know when we stopped raising kids and started catering to every little nonsense thing kids make up, but we have raised a generation of whiny little shits.", "I definitely wasn't what I'd call \"well established\" when I was 30. But there's nothing wrong with leaving a job if it was hostile or not good for your mental health, as long as you found something better.   \n\nIdk how old you are, but you're coming off as someone who just complains about millennials because we refuse to stay in shit jobs forever. The vast majority of us actually do know how to \"deal with things\" because we've been doing it most of our lives.    \n\nMy parents are baby boomers and they fully understand that our generation got the short end of the stick. Higher education is *vastly* more expensive than it was for them, we can't easily buy a house making minimum wage, and we can't afford to have children even if we want them.    \n\nJust because you see a handful of millennials like OP who are immature doesn't mean we all are.", "Bingo!  Her behavior is \\*checks notes\\* controlling.", "That depends on whether she has a history of doing this, or if she now starts one.\n\nIf it's the first time, I won't judge her harshly. But if it's part of or becomes a pattern, then it's another story", "I hate to say it because you say it reasonably, but this is kind of a toxic take.  It's not men's fault that some women tend to be so unreasonably based in emotion.  Women also get a ton of enablement for throwing themselves on the floor when bad things happens.  Imagine being a man sitting home on a saturday night texting his gf constantly to come home and throw a pity party with him because life is hard.  Every girl in that friend group would be like, \"It's time to find an adult\", and they'd be right.", "If your partner is having a crisis and asks for some support - and it's the first time something that serious has come up - would you blow her off?", "It happened to me after I moved in with my partner. \n\nNot a crisis per se, but they didn't have friends and I did. But every weekend I was about to go out, they suddenly felt sad or something happened and I was guilted into staying.", "I doubt it\u2019s the first time. Where are her friends in all this btw?", "In these cases the person who does this doesn't have many friends or \"I don't see my friends because I prioritize you why can't you do the same!! when you're in a relationship the outside people don't matter anymore!\""]}
