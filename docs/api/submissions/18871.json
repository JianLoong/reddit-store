Texting isn't the way to communicate about it. Sending that at 10pm was purposely meant to ruin his evening like you felt yours was ruined, that's asshole behaviour.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  \n\nHe should have been courteous and let you know explicitly when he was coming to your place (or if he had changed his mind). But you're 30 and he's not your emotional support animal.", "ESH.\n\nI think you could have waited to mention that it's important to you that he comes home when he says he's coming home, or send a message to let you know he will be late. Sometimes you're out and about and just having a good time and you want to stay out. Him not messaging you makes him wrong, BUT, you also should have not sent him a message. Waiting and talking it out at an appropriate time would have been best in my opinion. If him coming back late all the time becomes a regular thing just bin him off. Don't see him as the only way of getting into a new place.", "ESH\n\nHe is your boyfriend and not your therapist.  It feels as if you are treating him as a therapist.  That your emotional needs trump all.  \n\nHe failed to communicate his plans of when he would come over.  You failed to clarify at the time plans were made.", "Girl he called you by his ex\u2019s name??? Byeeee listen to the red flags!", "NAH and even though it's not what you want to hear, it's much better to receive this critical information now before moving in with him.\n\nYou're asking for support and thinking your relationship is in a place where he can and should give you emotional support.  You're even thinking of him as a potential partner, someone to take the next step with.\n\nHe's clearly communicating that he is not that person.  He is not going to prioritize you, give you the support you are asking for.  To use an old phrase - he's just not that into you.\n\nYou've asked him and he's answered.  He's telling you who he is.  If you don't listen, if you ignore this clear communication or allow yourself to be placated by a later apology or something, you'll be lying to yourself about this relationship.", "So if I'm reading this right, he expressed a plan to spend time with you, then dropped that plan without communicating to you.  Your way of dealing with it (messaging that you were disappointed in him and then adding more complaints on top) doesn't sound like it was the classiest possible way to go about things.  But it's hard to be classy when you're in distress and the distress does sound warranted.  The phrasing of his reaction is a problem.\n\nI do think you should work on your emotional regulation in the face of stress.  But I'm going to go with NTA.", "Info: how much time do you spend together in a typical week?\n\nIf he routinely blows you off for his friends that's one thing, but going strictly by what you've stated here, you sound a bit controlling/high maintenance.  There was also no need to text him while he was still out, it's not like he was going to be able to immediately drive to you.\n\nEdit: ESH but almost Y T A.  He is an asshole because he said he would be there but wasn't, but you're the bigger asshole for making this a bigger deal than it should be, and for trying to derail his time with his friends instead of waiting until the next day to have a real conversation.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from and how you could feel not supported, but at the same time you don\u2019t have to make him feel like shit because you do. I don\u2019t think this is really an AITA situation it\u2019s more of a you guys should talk it out situation. You were sad, and he was having a good time hanging out with his friends, it\u2019s a pretty common couple problem. Most couples have had this happen before. You can\u2019t destroy him for having some personal time with his friends, but he also can\u2019t be shocked that you\u2019re upset that he wasn\u2019t there for you", "It\u2019s not a surprise that one may get drunk after a brewery tour. It probably wasn\u2019t a good idea for you two to have plans to meet after that. My advice would be to give him a bit of grace understanding that him being drunk after spending the day drinking is understandable. Start fresh today\u2026", "YTA based off your comment that you spend 4 nights/1 full weekend day together and are telling him he doesn't prioritise the relationship. he clearly puts you first and spends most of his time with you. it is important that he has a life outside you and maintains his friendships. this is something you should be encouraging, not dismissing, nor devaluing. it's unfortunate that you had a bad week but his long-standing plans gave you an opportunity to reach out to someone else for support. he didn't specify when he'd be home and it's reasonable to assume he'd be out after a brewery tour. the way you handled your disappointment -texting, messaging while he's with friends- isn't conducive to resolving the issue and comes off like you're selfishly trying to punish/control him. id honestly apologise if i were you but also request more specific communication next time, i.e naming a rough time to expect him home. that's reasonable and fair . it'd also be a good idea to ask for his perspective so he has a chance to explain his feelings and be heard. i hope it works out for you!", "YTA.  He should have communicated better with you to let you know his plans had changed, but I feel like he intentionally didn't communicate with you because he feared your reaction.  \n\nYou're 30 years old, lost your lease and refer to your apartment as your \"safe space\".  You seem neurotic and controlling.", "NTA he should have communicated better", "Let the man be. It's one night.", "Did you want him to drive over while drunk? \n\nI understand you\u2019re going through a lot here, and yes he should be supportive, having said that, you also need to understand the tour was already booked, he too deserves space, and time with his friends, also please realize, that even if he\u2019s there, what can he do about what you\u2019re upset over, besides being supportive? Especially when he\u2019s drunk? If anything, he will not have a good perspective on things because his mind is clouded.   \n\nFrom what I read in your answer, in the comments, you spend a lot of time together, and it could be worse, he could only be there one night a week, but he\u2019s there for 4.. how many times do you go to his place during the week? \nI feel like you texting him kind of pouting (sorry I know you\u2019re upset) was a tiny bit controlling, but I\u2019m not liking his response either. It was a bit rude. You already stated you both have a bit of trouble with communication of emotions. You\u2019re both on a different level there.  If you move in together, which may not happen now, because you may want him home and around you )when he\u2019s not working, ) 24/7 \u2026 it may be a red flag to him that you\u2019re too clingy and needy. People need their own space and boundaries. And I DO understand you\u2019re going through a bad time, and need comforted, but not when he\u2019s drunk. \n\nESH \n\n\nbecause of his answer, but so do you for not letting him have some space, and go out with friends with a time limit. You\u2019d not like it if that was done to you.  Try to get some perspective on the situation you\u2019re in, breathe, don\u2019t get involved with the drama at work, (if possible) and best of luck finding a new place. Look at it as a new life for you! \u2665\ufe0f. \n\nSorry for the long post.\nEdited", "Unpopular opinion...NTA \n\n>in this morning he accidentally called me by his ex girlfriends name.\n\nFor this alone he's an AH \n\n>When I called him at 8 there was a girl who yelled down the phone\n\nHe's also a lying AH\n\nHe has shown that you can't rely on him or his word.\n\nGet a new apartment and a new bf you can trust", "YTA. You get plenty of time with him during the week by the sounds of it with one of your comments, and tell him he's prioritizing friends over you. I'm assuming this means you'd be willing to cancel plans you had with friends to stay home when he's having a rough go? I also think it's a matter of incompatibility. I'm exactly like him and can't stand drama or emotions and don't do well with them at all. It's one of the many reasons I don't date anymore. You have to realize that dumping all those emotions on him then hounding him while he's out with his buddies is going to be exhausting for him. Anyway, sounds like you're not compatible and need someone who is better equipped for your emotional needs, because honestly you sound a little needy.", "Gently, YTA\n\nHe said he wanted to be home with you tonight. It didn't sound like a specific time, and he may well have thought midnight or 1am was fine, he'd be with you all the next day.\n\nI never think it's a good look when a GF is texting \"*where are you*\" or \"*you haven't done X,Y and Z*\" when (a) the GF knows where he is, and (b) he's with friends.\n\nWould you like it if he did that to you when you were out on a planned night out with your GFs? I mean, it's healthy for people in a relationship to have their own friends. If my husband did this to me I'd feel seriously caged and like he doesn't want me to enjoy himself.  The apartment will work itself out, his being with you this moment isn't going to solve that.\n\nI'm sorry you're feeling anxious...but your reaction is yours to control, and if you need extra therapy/meds, then the doctor will be the better call. Also - start looking around for a new place, set up some apartment tours, do something that will solve the problem, rather than stressing that your BF isn't there.\n\nYou have a job, you live independently - you **can** do this.", "ESH, you for scolding him via text and him for his response and, to a lesser extent, his actions. \n\nDid you have explicit plans for him to contact you at X time or be at your place by Y time? If so and if he didn\u2019t follow up, that\u2019s AH behavior. It sounds like you didn\u2019t, though, and instead you relied on this kind of nebulous sense that he\u2019d come over.", ">He told me he wanted to come home and be with me tonight.\n\nTo me, this means that he wants to sleep with you tonight, not to spend the evening with you.  I don't know that either of you is an AH in this situation, but both of your communication skills definitely need work.  NAH", "NTA you now know his priorities, don't count on him to support you.", "NTA \nThis isn\u2019t any other week!!! you\u2019re going through a major change to the point that you are physically ill.

She's a fully grown adult, she's not a young person who is newly on her own without her parents. I'm 35 and I don't know anyone who would say that losing their rental is a crisis like this. Instead of stewing over where her boyfriend is and who he's with, she should be looking at new apartments.
