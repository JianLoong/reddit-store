That is just a slap in the face to give him $500 for a motorbike when you need $250 for school. It\u2019s rude and favoritism for sure. It would be one thing if they said no and he also didn\u2019t get anything, but no, he got literally twice the amount. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your parents kinda suck.", "NTA\n\nStart a GOFUNDME. Explain it as you did here, minus the argument at the end. Tag all outside family in it, as well as friends, classmates, etc. Everyone you know, basically.\n\nWhen your parents complain, explain you took their advice and 'you figured it out, like you always do'. Plus, it's not like you were lying. \n\nIf your parents are proud of themselves and think they were in the right, there should be no problem with others knowing what they did.", "NTA.\n\nThis is blatant favoritism and although you aren\u2019t entitled to their money, they behave like AHs and have to face the consequences of it.", "NTA - you're more responsible, so F\\* you, let's give money to the irresponsible person?!? Who the hell thinks like that?\n\nYou agreed you're not entitled to the money, but the sheer gall of their stance and it being rammed in your face? That's one gigantic final straw to me on the relationship.", "NTA. People don't like being called out on their shitty attitudes. I also don't think they understand the meaning of the word \"inconsiderate\". If you have a paypal or something I'd be happy to donate for school because yes, school is more important than a motorcycle.", "NTA\n\nThat *is* blatant favoritism and is absolutely bass ackwards. You don't reward someone for irresponsibility unless you want them to fail.", "NTA, although as someone who has been in your shoes, I can tell you that pointing this out doesn't actually change parental behaviour. Best to decide if you want to spend your life constantly frustrated, or distance yourself.", "NTA.  What kind of parent would prioritize a motorcycle over education??????", "NTA. Your parents are going to risk you graduating over $250 and they bought your brother a motorcycle? And their logic is it makes more sense to give money to the child who\u2019s irresponsible? I can see why you think they favor him because they clearly do and you called them out on it. I hope you get the money for your class and when they wonder why you rarely visit or call them you can remind them of this moment.", "NTA. Your graduating IS more important than a motorcycle, unless perhaps he really cannot get to work without it!\n\nCall all your relatives and explain what your parents did, refusing to pay an UNEXPECTED cost that will block your graduating when they had the funds to help you out (as evidenced by their handing twice as much to your brother right after you asked!).  Leave out the Golden child bit, just state facts. \n\nOr start a GoFundMe and tag your relatives and friends, explaining why you need the $$ and your parents refusal to help. \n\nAnd after you graduate, get a job and move away from these uncaring A holes.", "NTA -  I hope you do figure it out, and when you graduate and  move out you tell them if they ever need help, call your brother.", "NTA as someone who died on a motorcycle a couple years ago and thankfully still walking and breathing. Giving money to the irresponsible one to hope on a bike is asinine. I still love riding BTW and have no issues with the bike. Just irresponsible people being given the opportunity to ruin someone else's life on a machine that requires respect.", "NTA this was an unexpected expense and I\u2019m sure if it had been communicated to you earlier you would have budgeted for it. Education is more important than a motorbike and if anything the fact you are more responsible should mean that you have earned their trust in money spending!", "NTA Your family's fun!", "NTA, your parents sound like a mess. Is there anyone who can help you out in your time of need? A relative or a reliable friend you could borrow money from and eventually pay it off? Or even charging the program to a card and paying it back? Worst case, if not, then maybe you could visit your bank in person and see if they could work out a small loan for the money you need. If your parents aren't going to help, then they've made it clear where they stand. I'm sorry they're being like this to you...", "NTA- Horrible parents.  As for an immediate solution, would you be comfortable with buying it with a credit card and then paying it off within a month?  Does your school offer any resources for those in need?", "NTA  \n\n\nit is obvious that he is the favorite just by them giving him money when you ask, its like they had to have done so out of spite or something", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe parents would prioritize a motorcycle over a kid\u2019s education. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Are you just punking us?", "NTA. You simply spoke the truth. I hope you can work something out with the class. Can you talk to the bursar's office? Get a short term unsecured loan through your bank?\n\nAnd congratulations on putting yourself through school. That's a huge accomplishment. Your parents don't deserve you.", "NTA. And someone mentioned a gofundme. Do it. Also, remember this when you leave home and they come asking for money for you or your brother.", "NTA. If you are in the U.S., ask your university\u2019s Financial Aid office for an \u201cemergency loan.\u201d They can recalculate your academic costs to include this fee and cover it. \n\nOr, call the Foundation that supports your university. Ask if there are emergency funds and document the expense and the emergency timeframe. \n\nOr, dial 2-1-1 for your local United Way and ask them. \n\nBest wishes.", "NTA-why wouldn't they just split 250 for brother and 250 for you.", "They refused to give you $250 for your education and then turned right around and gave your brother double that for a motorcycle? NTA, they are, including brother. Clearly he knows they'll always be there to clean up his messes for him. I'd go low or no contact if I were you. See if you can get a payday loan or some sort of short-term loan to cover the cost of the material.", "Rewarding irresponsible behavior just creates more irresponsible behavior. Your parents aren\u2019t very good at their job. You are NTA.\n\nHonestly parents like this make no sense to me. Why drive away the one person capable of taking care of you in your old age? If I were you, and if they already thought I was an asshole and I didn\u2019t mind permanently burning a bridge, I would be tempted to say \u201cYou know what? Fine. Don\u2019t help me. But don\u2019t expect me to help you when you need elder care. You are clearly good at taking care of [brother], so you should be able to take care of yourselves. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll figure something out.\u201d\n\nThis situation sucks and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with it. Ask for help at your school. Universities sometimes have emergency assistance for students that your professor doesn\u2019t know about.

You can call them out but they aren\u2019t listening and they don\u2019t care. Maintain the contact you want. But understand, they\u2019re never going to stand up for you or help you, they\u2019ve made it clear.\n\nSecond, don\u2019t panic. How\u2019s your credit? 250$ is objectively not too much compared to having to drop the class. Are you financially responsible? You sound like you are since the only money you seem to have \u201cblown\u201d has been on school. Can you get a 0% interest credit card? Do you have a credit score? DONT take out a payday loan, but credit cards can usually be approved in under a week. Take the hit, do a money transfer if they won\u2019t let you pay with card and pay itr back as soon as possible. Hell even with interest and even if your broke you can probably pay 250$ back on the credit card relatively painlessly even if the money transfer gouges you some APR.\n\nBut when you pay it back, don\u2019t close the card if you trust yourself not to use it. Build your credit up. Closing the card so soon after applying, especially if it\u2019s your only credit line will hurt your score unnecessarily.", "NTA and now you know the facts.

Not sure where you are located but most colleges have secret funds it may take multiple days in the finance office but they can find funds.\n\nI had a friend that every semester has to cover a couple hundred dollars that her loans and scholarship didnt cover. They paid for it every time.", "NTA. It's really shitty of them to do that. Your education is at risk here, and they just expect you to figure it out yourself when they gave out twice that amount for a motorcycle that's less urgent. \n\nYour brother is the jerk here, not you. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this, and honestly I'm kind of worried. I hope things will work out for you.", "NTA. \n\nBut inwouod go above your professors head and get in touch with his supervisor. Because this is something that should have been addressed and discussed at the beginning of the semester. Not a month later. \n\nHad the professor given you advanced notice, as he's required to do most likely. Then you couod have had time to figure it out. But he didn't and you dont have time. \n\nI would talk to someone above him and let them know whats going on and get some help that way.", "Tell the truth and shame the devil!"]}
