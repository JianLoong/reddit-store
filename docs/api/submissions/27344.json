Not your religion,no reason to use the honorific. Now if you are in a majority Islam practicing country, it might not be a bad idea to add it just so this awkward situation doesn't happen again, but definitely NTA.", "NTA. You referred to him in a way that is common, especially for people not of that faith. I assume the person complaining would never say \"Our Lord and Savior\" before referring to Jesus.", "NTA. Your classmate is wrong. I'm not a religious person, but I studied it fairly extensively in college and your approach was the approach shared by all my classmates.", "NTA. Saying the phrase after sounds like an active part of worship, which you don't do for him. \n\nI've had several religious conversations and debates with Muslims before and in those conversations I've just referred to him as Muhammad and they never brought it up or commented, so it doesn't seem to be a universal thing to care about in that religion from what I can tell. And they weren't the type to let it rest if it was truly disrespectful because they knew I was coming from a place of mutual respect and understanding. This guy sounds like he just wanted to be offended. \n\nYou're not practicing the religion and the honorific isn't part of his name or title. Even referring to him as a prophet is more respectful than necessary because he's only a prophet from that religions (and potentially the other abrahamics?) perspective.", "\"Islamaphobic for not doing so.\"\n\nBS.  It's not your faith, so you don't have to do the honorifics.  Just like a non-Catholic isn't expected to do the sign of the cross (genuflect) when they enter pew in a Catholic church.", "Nta. You are not obligated to venerate any deity. Period. Your classmate is a fool.", "NTA. It's not your religion. Like the other commenter mentioned, most Christians wouldn't expect people of other religious to say \"Lord and Savior\" before \"Jesus.\"", "Nope NTA. The \"peace be upon him\" honorific is for Muslims to indicate their respect, but is not required of non believers. If he questions you again about this, just tell him \"there is no compulsion in religion\", which is supposed to be an article of his faith, and means that he cannot expect you to comply with his practices.\n\nIn practice, many Muslims will only use the \"peace be upon him\" upon first reference, and drop it subsequently or go out of their way to avoid saying his name so they don't have to repeat it each time. Like how in writing it's often abbreviated to \"pbuh\" - they know it's cumbersome to say/write out each and every time. This guy was just being silly and pretentious.", "NTA that\u2019s bullshit. You have no obligation as a non-Muslim to add that to the name. Even Muslims don\u2019t always do it.", "You also have to turn around three times and clap your hands twice...\n\nNTA. You don't have to follow every made up rule that people create. You were talking about a historical figure, not participating in a religious ceremony, there was no disrespect, just a religious bigot who couldn't stand by and be civil.", "NTA.  I thought pbuh was reserved for use by Muslims as well.  \n\nWhy \"honor\" someone you don't hold in that regard?  Seems hypocritical and patronizing to me.", "To be a professional historian you have to be somewhat impartial and objective. For me, adding a religious honorific after a persons name shows that that might not be the case here with your classmate and more than likely your classmate should be studying theology instead of history. And as a MAJOR no less...\n\nYou did nothing wrong by not adding the honorific. To be honest, if you have a trusting relationship with the professor or whomever is teaching this course, I would bring this question up with them.\n\nYours sincerely, a fellow history major", "Ask him to draw you a picture with the correct title just so you know to get it right in the future  \n\n\nObviously NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsk him if HE is willing to do the same: Will he call Cthulhu the great good chthulu in public?

Religions like to force themselves on nonbelievers as way to dominate and intimidate.  You don't have to kowtow to anything if it not your belief.", "NTA..... \"With all due respect, honorifics that are religion specific are held as a form of respect by that religion's practitioners. I am not one and therefor its not required nor disrespectful. \"", "As others have said, no. That\u2019s used by Muslims to show respect to a deity they believe in and hold in high regard. If you believe in a different religion or none then you don\u2019t need to honour a different/ any deity.\n\nYou didn\u2019t say anything Islamophobia.\n\nNTA", "No it is not disrespectful.

That kid is just looking to be a victim.", "NTA I do the same thing when having to talk about Jesus. I never include the Christ part because that part means saying that he is the messiah and my religion doesn't believe that he was anything more than a normal human that lived and died (he is not divine, he is not the messiah and he plays no part in my religion). If someone has a problem with that, that is on them not me.", "NTA. Fun fact there is no God and therefor any prophets claiming otherwise would be false.
