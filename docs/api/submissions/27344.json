My Jewish friends won\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t have a cheeseburger, my Muslim friends won\u2019t tell me I can\u2019t eat pork, and I\u2019ll be damned if I let my catholic friends tell me I can\u2019t jerk off.", "I can hate both.", "So you hate a huge portion of the people on this earth for no real reason other than you hate the concept of faith? I mean I'm an atheist but jeez I don't go around hating people because they believe in something", "Going to sue you for almost making me choke to death on a turkey burger!", "OMG thank you for this! Hard day and I laughed so hard at this...", "You would disrespect the guy Christians are always bothering everyone else about in this, the Year of their Lord 2023?", "Its Jesus MotherFucking Christ.", "Jesus H Roosevelt Christ?", "Did you do The Cross Points\u2014spectacles, testicles, wallet, & watch?", "Nuptial Mass only happens when both parties are Catholic, otherwise it makes no sense; they're not going to offer communion to your wife on the altar when you can't receive. \n\nIt's also more complicated in a mixed marriage; more guests will be ineligible receive communion so people get upset.", "We didn\u2019t have the Eucharist either because my husband is only sorta catholic and only his maternal family is Catholic.", "Lmao all i said is you rarely see them get criticized thats antisemitism?????", "Yeah on second read I absolutely agree with that", "I enjoyed this back and forth thoroughly.", "But... but... but if I can't *make* my religion apply to everyone else, then it isn't as fun!!!!  /s :D", "Oh don\u2019t worry it\u2019s obvious you hate people who are born queer, no need to tell me \ud83d\ude18", "No, the majority of faiths do the things I mentioned above.
