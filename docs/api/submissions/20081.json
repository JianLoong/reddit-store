Your mother just wanted to see you. You successfully have made her cry all day. How dare you. We asked before to see you. You refuse \u201d etc etc etc. and then when I responded explaining what happened, he ignored me and declined my calls. I sent 30+ texts to my parents individually and together explaining I am happy to celebrate with them but didn\u2019t appreciate them changing MY plans without telling me or asking me. \n\nOnce party started, my mother sent me hundreds of texts about how she\u2019s never been hurt so bad in her life except for by me. How she can\u2019t stop crying and congradulating me for making that happen, etc.  And when she heard I was spending my own birthday party crying in the bathroom (only until 10:30pm then I put my phone away for the night) she goes \u201cme too\u201d. Then midnight rolls around and she says \u201chappy birthday. I won\u2019t be talking to you tomorrow\u201d. \n\nThe next day, my father doesn\u2019t even call me.

She is STILL explaining how hurt she is and when we spoke the day after about how it was all misinterpreted, she refused.  \n\nIn the end; they\u2019re passing over it. We\u2019re fine.

They are not always the same.\n\nJust because someone says that you \"hurt them\" does not always mean they're being honest. Some people will say it because they've learned it gets them responses that end up to their benefit. Why should you have to apologize to a manipulator who's just manipulating?\n\nOther times it can be that someone is hurt, not because of what you did or didn't to, but because they had an unreasonable expectation for your actions and you did not align with them.\n\nFor example, I could have an expectation that you'll give me a Gold award for this comment. I don't really, but if I did, I could be hurt when you don't to it. But should you have to apologize because I was hurt by what was really my own unreasonable expectations? No. Not at all.

Your mom is super self centered and your dad seems to be her enabler. She was dead wrong", "Hey please repost on r/raisedbynarcissists !\n\nYou are NTA, anyone is entitled to have a birthday party without their toxic parents", "Your family (your mom, and then her flying monkeys who dont want to deal woth her upset and are used to handling things this way for her) acts this way on purpose to get you to cave. They quite literally bullied you about your own birthday, controlled your perfectly fine plans with your siblings when you had a very nice plan as well for dinner with your mom. You had it all thought out, but your mom feels the need to feel excluded so she has something to be upset about. She may not see it, but she needs to be at the center of the family or she is unsettled and finds something to be upset about. I have a grandmother that acts this exact way when she is \"excluded\" but she only acts as unhinged as your mom when it comes to me and my dad (not her niblings), otherwise she will talk to us about how \"hurt\" she is that this other person would \"do this to [her] after all [she's] done for them!\" When she has done what a normal loving family member would do in terms of helping a loved one when they need it, and then the other person has said they cant make it to a thing, or maintained a boundary that was always there. She will try to act nice or buy you things, then act like youre wrong for not letting her decide something in youenlife or at least include her in EVERYTHING. \n\nExample is when i moved away and she was sending me money for food each week in college. She was beside herself upset that i was upset about something that i didnt want to talk about. It was just something not worth talking to her about, it was very personal as well, i had said \"oh i was just talking to my sister about something\" and she hounded me for a day and a half about why i didnt trust her, she wished we were closer so i could tell her. She wanted to know what shwd done that was so awful that i didnt feel i could open up to her. \nAt a certain point i said, listen do you even hear what youre saying to me? Called out how crqzy she sounded, said im not her girlfriend i am her granddaughter and she cant control my life or be in every simgle part of it, it is my life.\nI had to stand up for myself or she would never change, she would always be trying to spin me in circles to get me to help her feel good. That isnt okay, either your mom is doing it on purpise because she is a narcissist and need to be in control (which is what it reads like, especially with the flying monkeys and your dad going a  step farther than just being an enabler and attacking/ignoring you as well) or she is like my grandmother and has been enabled and is not completely mentally well, and needs to learn boundaries. \n\nEither way, these people did this because they knew they could get you to cave, and now that they got wjat they wanted (and likely know it was wrong to do this) they arent ever going to apologize because they know they can get things to \"go back to normal\" just fine by doing things the way they always have. If you wanted an apology, you shouldve tried to do your kormal plans with siblings, ignore your parwnts horrible messages (certainly dont cater to them, thats insane but im guessing its cause youre used to this - i used to the same with my grams side of the family) and then take their word for it when they havw temper tantrums and dont want to see you. ALLLL of their goal on the first half of this was to make you feel like shit to get their way, thats IT. They didnt ever care about how you felt, only what they wanted and would prefer to do on YOUR day. These people dont care about you, even though they are your parents and theyre supposed to, theyre not required to unfortunately. They will howeever, have you beleive that you are required to love them. Thats not true either, nobody owes anybody anything, least of all a relationship that was never nurtured to begin with. If you were coerced and guilttripped your whole life instead of supported, you will talk yourseld into a relationship because they did so much for you, paid for food and a roof and did all these things everyones parents are supppsed to do. If they did the bare minimum, they arent entitled to anl relationship. Even parents who did it well woth boundaries instead of entitlement, with all the forgiveness and love in the world, would not expect a relationship with their kid. It is a privelage, not a right, to be in your adult childs life. These parents dont deserve to be in yours after how they acted on a day that is meant to celebrate you and your existence in this world. It shouldve been what younwanted or a day to make you happy at yhe very least. Instead they shit all over you to makw you feel like shit in an effort to get your mom what she wanted, to be the most important person on your birthday again. You dont owe them anything, and they owe you probably way more apologies than just for this instance, but im sure youll never get one. Take care of yourself, not your parents. They can take care of themselves just fine, and have been teaching you how to take care of their needs for your entire life, you need to learn how to take care of you now.", "NTA, honestly i personally think you should cut them out of your life, it sounds like they are just problems that use emotional abuse to get their way", "Wow your parents are drama queens.

Cut them off.", "That is all part of the manipulation. They don't say sorry but behave in a  way to make you feel bad. It's abusive.\n\nYou need to distance yourself every time they behave this way.

May the rest of your birthdays be better than the ones that have already passed.", "This may seem counterintuitive, but a really effective way to push them to change is lean in to being the bad guy.

Then the issue becomes \u201cis Supersecret321 a hurtful child?\u201d\n\nCut to the end next time and tell them point blank \u201cYes I\u2019m making you cry because you\u2019re a bad mother who has to make her own child\u2019s birthday about her and cannot stand going a single day without being the center of attention. And you wonder why I don\u2019t want to spend time with you.\u201d Block them after. One of two things will happen: they will either apologize to you a while later or find another victim to oppress.

Nothing you say will change their minds, because you\u2019re misunderstanding their goal, which is to make you feel guilty and unsure of yourself. They don\u2019t actually care about the birthday dinner, because any reasonable person would understand that you have a life and people need to be flexible when making plans. \n\nAny reasoning you try to present to them only gives them more ammunition to manipulate you.", "Well, now you know that your apologies mean nothing to them when they\u2019re worked up and unreasonable. So that saves you some time and energy next time they flip their shit over nothing. Zero apologies will have exactly the same effect as fifty."]}
