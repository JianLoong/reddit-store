Your mother just wanted to see you. You successfully have made her cry all day. How dare you. We asked before to see you. You refuse \u201d etc etc etc. and then when I responded explaining what happened, he ignored me and declined my calls. I sent 30+ texts to my parents individually and together explaining I am happy to celebrate with them but didn\u2019t appreciate them changing MY plans without telling me or asking me. \n\nOnce party started, my mother sent me hundreds of texts about how she\u2019s never been hurt so bad in her life except for by me. How she can\u2019t stop crying and congradulating me for making that happen, etc.  And when she heard I was spending my own birthday party crying in the bathroom (only until 10:30pm then I put my phone away for the night) she goes \u201cme too\u201d. Then midnight rolls around and she says \u201chappy birthday. I won\u2019t be talking to you tomorrow\u201d. \n\nThe next day, my father doesn\u2019t even call me.

This is awful\u201d all because of me. My mother send me probably texts about how because of me she feels like she has no family. \n\nSo yes I caved and did the resteraunt. She is STILL explaining how hurt she is and when we spoke the day after about how it was all misinterpreted, she refused.  \n\nIn the end; they\u2019re passing over it. We\u2019re fine.
