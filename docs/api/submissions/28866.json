She wanted to take \u201csummer off\u201d and recoup from the burnout she experienced. Very fair, supported the decision 100%.\n\nTypically I always have done the grocery shopping, dishes, take out the trash, and walk our dog. She cooks and does the laundry. She hires a house cleaner to do lion\u2019s share of the cleaning. Usually we split responsibility for everything else like feeding our pets, walking the dog, making the bed, etc\n\nI always have paid a larger share of our mortgage, bills, groceries, etc as I earn more - call it 60/40 split of bills when we are both employed. Now I pay about 80%+ or some bills in full because she is concerned about her savings being depleted. I have expressed concern about her spending habits as she makes $2k/month from unemployment and will spend hundreds per month on clothes/online shopping, $400+ on hair every couple months, etc. \n\nAs my work has gotten far busier and more stressful over the past few months, I have asked her to take on more responsibility around the house for the things that I normally have done. Important to note I DO NOT EXPECT TO BE EXEMPT FROM HOUSEWORK! Just need more help especially as I have been traveling and working later hours more often.\n\nShe has always refused and says things like \u201cYou just want me to be your Mom to do all of your stuff for you!\u201d and claiming that I am being lazy. \n\nShe has not applied for any jobs in her time unemployed. She had one interview set up by an old work connection of hers that did not pan out. She spends her weekdays working on her design portfolio which she says takes a long time (I\u2019m not a designer so idk?) but she has been working on it for 3 months, shutting herself in her office all day to work on it before spending the evenings playing Baldurs Gate on my gaming PC (it was Stardew Valley that she played all evening before BG3 came out)\n\nRecent example is that I went on a business trip to London for a full week+ and asked her before I left to handle the chores while I was away and to return an Amazon package for me. When I came home there was a giant pile of recyclables/boxes that hadn\u2019t been taken out despite trash service coming twice, sink overflowing with dirty dishes, and Amazon package sitting where I left it. She was surprised at why I was upset and it turned into a fight. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being manipulated.

If she doesn't want to do more chores, she can go back to work.   \n\n\nRegardless of whether she's working or not though, it is absolutely unacceptable to leave a mess for you to tend to when you return from a trip. That is absolute laziness.", "It certainly seems like she's taking advantage of the situation to live a carefree life of leisure.\n\nThe most charitable interpretation is that she's depressed from being unemployed and facing the prospect of looking for a new job. Instead of buying all those clothes, perhaps she needs to speak with a therapist. At any rate, her behavior as OP describes it is not reasonable.", "Exactly. She sounds really entitled not picking up more chores and spending do much of the little income she has on luxuries. And then she has the audacity to project her own behaviour on OP. I don\u2018t understand what\u2018s wrong with some people.", "Bravo.", "1 a day?  \nHow about one every 3 hours!  \n  \nWhen I'm 'unemployed' I'm employed by **MYSELF** to get another job.", "OP says wife accuses him of wanting her to be his mother.\n\nClearly OP's wife has turned OP into her mother.", "Honestly? I really am not sure. When I have taken advantage of unemployment before I\u2019ve had to provide proof of interviewing like a job application submitted, business card, etc.", "And just like you're not her mental health professional, you can't calm she *doesn't* have depression. \n\n> Sometimes lazy is just lazy. She sounds fine. She is furiously spending money on shopping and self care and playing teenager all on her husband\u2019s dime.\n\nReckless spending and avoiding responsibilities is absolutely a symptom of anxiety or depression. \n\n> I get taking a break from work. She did that. \n\nAs a mental health professional you should know that burnout can take *years* to recover from, and the symptoms can look like laziness to a lot of people. \n\n> But she is not even bothering to contribute to the household. She is trying to throw guilt on her husband because he asking her to help him out since he is working more to pay more of the bills while she plays. \n\nSounds like depression. Diving into video games for a sense of accomplishment after lack thereof in her professional life. \n\nIt's almost like she could be struggling with.... depression. Wild.", "I agree. She was the one creating all the mess as well. What would she do if she was single? \n\nHer working on her portfolio throughout the day could be counted as work/working towards work. But I do think she could clean up after herself when she\u2019s alone. Even during the day when he\u2019s working  if she\u2019s home alone during the day.", "Why is everyone ignoring the part where she is a designer and works on her portfolio everyday from morning until evening?\n\nIsn\u2019t that her working to actively improve her employment opportunities and the same effort of a course or job?", "I have in general always earned more than her due to our difference in careers. Over the last 5 years the gap has widened, and yet she has gotten to some roles that have paid her $135k/year.", "I\u2019m glad you said this because I am thinking about the long term as well. In one of our fights over this I have said that I don\u2019t know if I want kids because I don\u2019t know if she will take care of them. She scoffed and said \u201cOf course I would they need me!\u201d \n\nI have such a hard time believing it and it hurts me so much to feel that way. \ud83d\ude1e", "We\u2019re both white.", "I know for a fact she does not game during the day. In her office I genuinely believe she is doing work on her design portfolio, but the only issue is she is letting that be a blocker to even applying to jobs because she thinks it needs to be perfect exactly tailored for every interview.\n\nFor the one interview she did, she ended up going back and re-iterating a design she had done at the job she got laid off from to make it look better. That took her weeks.", "And then who's gonna pay her bills while she spends all day on bg3 lol?", "You mean wife beater? The lowest tier of beers.", "Right?, I would understand if she says \"I will apply non-stop to jobs 8 hours per day\" and doesn't have additional time. But this is not it.", "Thats exactly what I used to do.  Start applying for jobs at 10.00am through to 4.00pm, go for interviews  at job agencies etc.   Then start making dinner from scratch.   Probably explains why I had so few times in my life where I was not employed.   \n\nMy brothers had to be dragged out of bed with the threat of being kicked out by my father whilst telling anyone that'd listen that I had such \"good luck\" finding jobs.  It wasn't good luck,  it was hard work and tbh I hated some of the jobs I had but looking back it bought me to some of the best jobs I've ever had!", "I don't think most people resent it. I think the resentment was mostly towards women not having a choice, especially as some women could have been far more brilliant than their husbands if given a chance.\n\nAlthough some people can be very judgemental of both housewives and househusbands.", "People resent it now because those men who want it also now want the woman to work and contribute financially. While still taking care of the house. \n\nAgreed though. Wife isn't being fair at all.", "My province runs on EI. We have a buytload of seasonal workers who claim for 1/2 of the year. \n\nAnd they paid in to get it so they should. \n\nThey answer weekly reports search the jobs each is on...but it never is really.", "Well, in Sweden we do technically have that, but that process is so sloppy that you can cheat through it.", "It\u2019s almost like we are expecting her to put on her big girl pants and do something about it.", "Why are you getting downvoted?! None of us actually know this woman, so both comments are a valid take. She could or could not be depressed, and it's important for OP to see this as a potential to help her IF she needs it. The internet is weird.", "Seriously, why are you getting killed here. The so called mental health professional sounds fairly clueless to me. I suffered from depression, was diagnosed by an actual dr. and with the exception of the gaming, I was the wife.", "They're a professional, but I'm guessing not a good one", "Then she should shut up and be a woman?", "We must be from the same province \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "And she\u2019s using that income mostly on herself or the ration wouldn\u2019t be 80/20. Plus he is not asking her to do all the chores, just a bit more than before.\n\nAnd that\u2019s is no justification for expecting him to do her dishes when he wasn\u2019t even there that week.", "When I was a stay home mom, my husband used to complain that I was wasting a lot of money on myself. I was buying clothes for him and the kids and sometimes even for me, and replacing household items like sheets and towels and kitchen equipment as it wore out. But all he saw was that I was spending money in stores, so I must be wasting it on myself.\n\nI went back to work last year and it's pretty funny that my husband insisted I never did anything around the house, but the house went to hell when I was too tired to keep up my usual level of cleaning. I stopped washing his laundry and he piled it on top of his hamper until it was taller than me. Then he bought me a new washer and dryer so I would \"have fun doing his laundry again\". I used it to wash my clothes and my daughters did their laundry, but nobody washed his. After several months, he did his laundry because it got too smelly to wear again. He also likes to leave dishes on the couch. I stopped picking them up and at one point he had twelve dirty plates on the couch and armrest. He would sit down and they would start sliding toward him.  He told me I was really letting the house go instead of taking pride in it like I used to. There are more examples, but you can see why I'm sympathetic toward the woman in this story and why I think it would sound different from her point of view."]}
