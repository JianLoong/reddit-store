She wanted to take \u201csummer off\u201d and recoup from the burnout she experienced. Very fair, supported the decision 100%.\n\nTypically I always have done the grocery shopping, dishes, take out the trash, and walk our dog. She cooks and does the laundry. She hires a house cleaner to do lion\u2019s share of the cleaning. Usually we split responsibility for everything else like feeding our pets, walking the dog, making the bed, etc\n\nI always have paid a larger share of our mortgage, bills, groceries, etc as I earn more - call it 60/40 split of bills when we are both employed. Now I pay about 80%+ or some bills in full because she is concerned about her savings being depleted. I have expressed concern about her spending habits as she makes $2k/month from unemployment and will spend hundreds per month on clothes/online shopping, $400+ on hair every couple months, etc. \n\nAs my work has gotten far busier and more stressful over the past few months, I have asked her to take on more responsibility around the house for the things that I normally have done. Important to note I DO NOT EXPECT TO BE EXEMPT FROM HOUSEWORK! Just need more help especially as I have been traveling and working later hours more often.\n\nShe has always refused and says things like \u201cYou just want me to be your Mom to do all of your stuff for you!\u201d and claiming that I am being lazy. \n\nShe has not applied for any jobs in her time unemployed. She had one interview set up by an old work connection of hers that did not pan out. She spends her weekdays working on her design portfolio which she says takes a long time (I\u2019m not a designer so idk?) but she has been working on it for 3 months, shutting herself in her office all day to work on it before spending the evenings playing Baldurs Gate on my gaming PC (it was Stardew Valley that she played all evening before BG3 came out)\n\nRecent example is that I went on a business trip to London for a full week+ and asked her before I left to handle the chores while I was away and to return an Amazon package for me. When I came home there was a giant pile of recyclables/boxes that hadn\u2019t been taken out despite trash service coming twice, sink overflowing with dirty dishes, and Amazon package sitting where I left it. She was surprised at why I was upset and it turned into a fight. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being manipulated.

What\u2019s not fair is refusing to address this in any way and expecting your partner to pick up 100% of your slack for months on end with no complaints or acknowledgment or plan out of it. \n\nManaging extremely basic household tasks your partner literally leaves the country is not a misogynistic or controlling expectation. Neither is wanting some indication she\u2019s doing *something* - whether that\u2019s looking for a job or curbing spending or taking on more housework. It sounds like you waited a few months after her layoff with no change in expectation and that\u2019s great. I\u2019m in a similar agreement with my husband right now during an unexpected gap before a new job. One week to veg out, then tap back in. We\u2019re all entitled to a break, but being an adult with a house and a partner means pulling your weight more than not. \n\nMy only recommendation would be that this decision shouldn\u2019t be about money. I\u2019m a wife who does most of the housework because I straight up have the time to. My husband and I have similar pay and hours on paper, but we saw that he was pulling a lot of OT and I was rarely working full days in reality. It makes it a logical team-focused decision - \u201cI\u2019m doing more housework because I\u2019m the one who is more able to do it right now\u201d - rather than an emotional transaction-focused one - \u201cI\u2019m doing more housework because I owe it to you for paying bills.\u201d", "NTA - I've been through redundancy and during my unemployment I continued to pay my share of the bills from my savings as motivation. Gov assistance was minimal and came in at about 15% of my previous salary. My spouse offered to take on more (all) financially (our salaries were essentially the same) but I declined stating that we can revisit the arrangement at a later date, keeping them updated with my financial status so I don't struggle.\n\nI was also suffering from burn out but my new job was to find a job. While my partner was out at work I was 'at work' applying, rewriting CVs etc. I'm very qualified in my field but due to the job market in my location it took 4-5 months to get a relevant job offer.\nDuring this time I picked up a few more chores but only because it made sense since I WFH and didn't have to commute etc, our house had never been cleaner, we also got an additional pet during this time since I was present in the house 24/7.\n\nAfter I received my job offer and everything was signed I pushed back my start date a little and took that time to rest. At that point I binge watched TV shows, movies, did some crafts, played video games, relaxed and treated myself. I entered my new job happy and revitalised. \n\nUnderstandably not everyone would be in the position to go this route. My partner and I are financially savvy and quite anal savers despite being fairly low earners and even pre pandemic would ensure all our finances could be covered on a single income.", "NTA what you\u2019re looking for is completely reasonable.", "I would try to get her to find a job ASAP. That should be the main goal, not doing more housework. You can hire a maid when you both have decent jobs.", "To be fair, updating a design portfolio could take significant time (if she wasn\u2019t keeping it up over time) and be considered part of \u201cworking hours\u201d in addition to any job seeking would. That\u2019s legitimate work, and yes, depending on the type of design, it could take a lot of hours to get a portfolio competitive in the current market. \n\nBut NTA in general for wanting more from her at home. \n\nThat said, it sounds like she\u2019s depressed, and it\u2019s not necessarily going to be about logic to actually solve it.", "$400 a month thew up a red flag.

PSA I'd think twice before having children with someone like this.", "Nta. She isn't taking true accountability.", "If she wants everything to be split equally (housework etc), make sure all the bills are as well.

NTA", "NTA.  There is a finite amount of effort required to maintain a home.  No matter the circumstances both partners should make an effort to put in 50% of the effort.  That\u2019s it really.  If she isn\u2019t, she should.  It\u2019s the same with relationships in general.  When they are uneven they gradually fail.  Resentment builds quickly.", ">She has always refused and says things like \u201cYou just want me to be your Mom to do all of your stuff for you!\u201d and claiming that I am being lazy.  \n>  \n>Now I pay about 80%+ or some bills in full because she is concerned about her savings being depleted.\n\nNTA.

I imagine that she might be feeling helpless and worthless without job prospects. \n\nTry to 8ncrease her self esteem. Get her out of the house.

And when you were out off town for work for over a week, you came home to a dirty home trash everywhere.? \n\nis she suffering from depression? Or has she always been like this?

Try Stella Artois, the Champagne of Beers.", "Or filling out applications during work hours...", "There it is!  In a partnership each side contributes.  The old fashioned way was the man worked and the woman took care of the house and kids.

Make it make sense. It\u2019s ridiculous and unsanitary. He wasn\u2019t even there to eat her cooking or create those dishes. This alone tells you she\u2019s being unfair.\n\nHer having more time is one component but her not contributing financially is also to be put on the table. Housewives understand that their contribution aren\u2019t financial, but supporting the working partner is a given.

I still have to go to work everyday or my bills wouldn\u2019t get paid. Asking her to do a few extra chores when he\u2019s covering everything and probably burned out himself isn\u2019t asking much.
