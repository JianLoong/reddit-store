I'd argue that she should have gotten rid of the house cleaner and taken that work over herself since that was part of her contribution to the household and she can't afford to pay for it now.

It doesn't matter what the normal division of labor is, if one partner is not home for a time, then all chores are on the spouse that is home. Basically, he can't have chores when he's not home to generate the mess. Like the dishes all being dirty when had been gone for a week. He didn't use any of those dishes.", "Ma\u2019am, this is a Wendy\u2019s.", "I work part-time, my SO is working full-time.   \nThe days I'm at home I do all the everyday chores - some cleaning, cooking, laundry.   \nThose days I'm at work I only cook, SO is tidying op.   \nBigger cleaning, gardening, grocery shopping we do together, usually weekends.   \nI also don't contribute financially the same amount - as earning much less, I spend much less on joint expenses.   \nWe both have a feeling it is a pretty fair and it works for both of us many years.", "This!!! \nI wish I could upvote this comment a trillion times.", ">Don't marry her, and if you think you're stressed and overworked now, PLEASE don't be naive enough to have a kid with this person.\n\nThey're already married.  They absolutely should not have kids though.", "Oof, I really felt that. You have been getting so much shit in the comments and I feel for you having to read them. But I see you. I\u2019ve been you. Life can feel really hard at times and this is one of those times for you. Everyone is basically saying \u201cyou just need to pull your socks up\u201d but it\u2019s not a switch that you can flick, it\u2019s a process that needs to come from within - and it will, in time. Trust in yourself and trust in the process; you will get there. It sounds like you have a great husband so just keep communicating with each other. Best of luck!", "To add: my husband literally took 2 months off recently and he was full house-hubby mode. I was still working so I\u2019d wake up to him having made coffee, done or doing the dishes, and he made dinner most nights. Now that he\u2019s back to doing things, we are back to a more balanced workload. That\u2019s what I mean by it shouldn\u2019t matter what gender the person taking time off is, the responsibilities should shift.", "I wouldn\u2019t suspect depression\u2026.. while it looks very different from person to person, she is using \u201cmisogyny\u201d to manipulate him into not being an equal partner.", "Exactly!!! I totally agree with your comment.", "Ha! That's just what I was thinking.", "When I was between jobs I took a job at a grocery store outside my field because when you\u2019re not making anything, money is money. Since it was part time as most retail jobs are I spent the extra time putting my resume out to get a job again in my field. I\u2019m not sure what OP\u2019s spouse is doing here.", "The resentment was more 1. Women did not any choice in the matter, and 2. Men were doing literally nothing at home in regards to household chores/childcare, so basically being an extra, overgrown child the wife had to look after as well as the actual children. \n\nNow I agree that when one partner is working, the one who doesn't work/works significantly less should take in the bulk, but working doesn't exempt you from cleaning your messes, cooking occasionally or looking after the children you created.\n\nThe main problem now is that the men who want a \"traditional wife\" look after the house, cooks and cleans while also expecting her to also miraculously have an income to pay her part of the finances too, but are sulky that they can't have it both ways.", "You probably need to re-evaluate your marriage to her because she\u2019s taking advantage of you and manipulating you too. You\u2019re not her father.", "Most ppl just lie and put down places they\u2019ve applied at. Or they do apply but don\u2019t answer if they call for an interview", "That\u2019s fine, she\u2019s working on her portfolio, but if she doesn\u2019t apply or actively look for a job, what\u2019s the point?? It\u2019s been months.", "If she were a designer before, surely she'd already have a portfolio.  The fact that she's just now creating one makes me think that she's trying to become a designer.  I'm also concerned about it taking 3 months of 8+ hour days and she's still not ready.  She hasn't given a rough timeline of when her portfolio will be ready, either, which I'd expect from a professional designer.  An an example:  \"My finished portfolio will have 10 company logos, which takes me 4 hours per logo to create, 10 web page mock ups, which is 6 hours each, and 10 book cover mockups, which is 5 hours each.  That's 150 hours, plus an additional 20 hours for creating my own web space plus 6 hours of SEO tuning afterward as I monitor web site traffic trends.\"\n\nIf she is a designer, she could at least do some Fiverr jobs to help build her portfolio.  Even if she doesn't make much off of them, it would be something in the meantime to add to her resume.", "Partners are supposed to need each other as well. She needs you to coddle her and let her live a great life without lifting a finger. What do you need her for? I was a SAHM for 15 years and I did all the housework and yard work during that time, hubs worked hard and very long hours which I appreciated so much. I repaid that by making sure he could spend time with our kids when he was home, not mowing the lawn or cleaning bathrooms.", "Sir, please don\u2019t have kids with her and it might be in your best interest to separate temporarily from her. Stop allowing to keep gaslighting and manipulating you. \nStop being a doormat. \nNTA.", "With your logic... he isn't her father or maid. So... I guess, they should live in feckin messy house.", "There is a phenomenon in which depressed people manipulate those around them to keep caring for them. So its very posible that she is both, depressed and trying to manipulate op", "Oh damnit that\u2019s right.", "yeah I have a friend who was laid off from an event planning company and they gave her a year of her full salary as severance. She made more money that year because of her annual severance salary + collecting unemployment. \n\nHowever I do not recommend. Most companies are not that generous and will only do 40-60% of your annual pay for a few months.", "Same in Danmark - you have to send a few CVs weekly and register it on your profile, but that's basically it.", "I suppose so, yeah. Nonetheless, you do have to provide documentation if requested (at least in my state). And they can ask you for it even after you\u2019re no longer receiving unemployment, for at least a year or two. So even if you aren\u2019t actually applying for jobs, you need to have a spreadsheet or something with dates and names of places you supposedly applied to. If you are asked for this proof and don\u2019t provide it, you could have to pay back all the unemployment you received.", "Based on my personal experiences with friends who were diagnosed, they tried pretty hard to stay on their feet and they couldn\u2019t. They knew they were doing less and they felt terrible about it but they just couldn\u2019t make themselves do the work a healthy individual could output. In this case, depression doesn\u2019t have anything to do with it since she\u2019s not experiencing any burnout symptoms. She just doesn\u2019t want to and rather than talk it over, she jumped straight to accusing her SO (OP). Hence, I don\u2019t think this warrants the consideration that she may be depressed. And even if she is, it\u2019s not on OP to pick up her load, it\u2019s on her to get the help she needs and not use OP as a crutch while she gets to live her best life."]}
