MIL saw that we had not included two of the veggies and went and added a small amount of each to her plate. She then told my daughter to try at least everything on her plate. My daughter said she doesn't like them (this is when my husband and I heard what MIL was doing because we had already started digging in and helping our 2 year old). We told MIL to stop and she doesn't need to eat those. MIL argued that they were on her plate and every kid needs the rule that you need to at least try a bite of everything. I told her it was not our rule and I did not put those things on my daughter's plate. She said she did because she should eat them. My husband told her to leave it alone. She told my daughter yet again to eat the broccoli and sprouts and I told her she cannot force my child to eat something she doesn't want.\n\nMIL yelled and told me I am going to raise a picky eater with a bad attitude toward food if I didn't stop catering to her like that.

I had a very unhealthy relationship with food my whole childhood. Part of that, it is believed, was due to how strict my parents were about food. They did not believe you could dislike a piece of food and would always insist I eat everything and eat it all up. They would berate me, yell at me and intimidate me into eating the stuff I did not like. It created some bad compulsions that led to me starving myself through a large portion of my childhood. I was removed from my parents thanks to my grandparents stepping in when at the age of 13 I passed out in school and was rushed to the hospital. I was malnourished, weak as a preemie kitten and I did almost lose my life because of it. It took several years for any kind of healthy attitude to food to begin and I am very much still a work in progress. So MIL saying what she did really upset my husband because MIL is aware of what I went through and that I of all people do know what an unhealthy attitude to food is like.\n\nDespite all this, my telling MIL she couldn't force my daughter to eat something started off a big chain reaction and I wonder if I'm TA for saying it to her like that and whether I could have made things less explosive.", "created_utc": 1681813925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qis9c/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_cannot_force_my_child/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Many kids don't like Brussel Sprouts and Broccoli at your daughter's age because they taste too bitter to young children, and like them fine when they're older if not put off them for life by being forced to eat them too early.  \n\n\nSecondly, because even if you were wrong, you're the parent, you get to be the decider.    \n\n\nThirdly, because your daughter is your MIL's guest, and it's way rude for your MIL to treat a guest at her table - even one your daughter's age! - the way she did. If a guest says no to the food, the host says politely \"Oh sorry you don't like it\" not \"I have a rule you have to eat it!\"", "You're NTA. \n\n>MIL saw that we had not included two of the veggies and went and added a small amount of each to her plate.\n\n>MIL argued that they were on her plate and every kid needs the rule that you need to at least try a bite of everything\n\nFind out what your MIL doesn't like to eat, and next time she is at your home, pile it on her plate and quote her words back to her.", "NTA - you're not responsible for the unreasonable actions of others.\n\nYou're MIL is trying to interfere with how you're raising your children, she can either wind her neck in or not see your family.", "NTA. Your MIL is controlling. She should not be over stepping on your parenting and telling you how to raise your children. Something these older generations don\u2019t realize is that we raise our kids because of things that we went through when we were kids. And we try to avoid the same traumas on our children. You are absolutely correct. MIL is wrong.", "You're being good parents & respecting your children by listening to what they do & don't like. You're NTA because you were & are right. Your MIL was trying to push food onto your daughter & made a rule to satisfy herself. It wasn't as if your daughter had no veggies on her plate. She just didn't have the two she doesn't like & that's completely okay. \n\nOf all people *you* understand what can cause an unhealthy relationship with food & you're doing the right things to make sure that doesn't happen with your children. What your MIL did is exactly what you *shouldn't* do because it can/will cause issues. \n\nKeep doing what you & your husband are doing because you're being good parents. I'm wondering if this is the first time that your MIL has done something like this though because it seems odd that she'd suddenly cross this boundary so hard. Either way, she was completely wrong & owes all of you an apology as well as her never doing it again.", "NTA. \n\nRegardless of your background (though not to minimize it), your MIL was out of line, and she was the *only* one out of line.\n\nYou didn't make things explosive, not the way you're telling it here. All you did was tell her to stop pushing food on your kid. She's the one that took up with the yelling. It's not your responsibility to control her reactions, it's hers. If she wants to fly off the handle over a piece of broccoli, that's her problem. Don't make it yours. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong. And special mention for your husband who told his mother to back off. Sounds like you two and your little family are doing just fine.", "NTA. Trying to force a child to eat something can create an unhealthy relationship with food. You know that and it's prove by science.  \nWhen my son, and now daughter, turned 2 they became very picky eaters. They love meat but are not a big fan of vegetables. My son still isn't but eats it better now. My daughter absolutely refuses to eat. We don't force her. If she eats it, fine. \n\nTheir peadiatrician advised us to give them more fruit but still keep offering them. Put it on their plate, offer it in different ways. We also give yoghurt as dessert and we add fruit to it. That way they still get their vitamins.  \n\n\nAlso, your child, not your MIL's so she hasn't got a say. Your MIL is stuck in an old wives tale about picky eaters.\n\nMaybe next time invite her over and serve foods she doesn't like...She what she says when you tell her she's a picky eater and she should not be able to leave before she eats what you serve her... ;)", "NTA.\n\n>MIL argued that they were on her plate and every kid needs the rule that you need to at least try a bite of everything.\n\nShe put them there and started making up rules.

There might have been enough food scarcity in society that people had to eat what they were given because otherwise they\u2019d starve.

Now you know where not to go for meals. Since it's his mother, your husband should talk to his mother privately.

Your daughter not liking broccoli/sprouts at 4 years old isn't a big deal. Given your history, you're doing your best to help your daughter.

My mother had and still has when guests come over that you dont have to eat everything, not even the things you like.  \n\nTho i as a kid was allergic to a lot of things i am so unpicky eater i am difficult to make food for, i eat what i am given haha", "NTA, it would be understandable if your child declined all vegetables and MIL was ensuring she was getting a balanced diet (although there are better ways to encourage children to eat). However, forcing a child to eat specific food which they do not like and will not pose a risk to health by not eating it is out of line. Especially considering MIL knows your history with food. \n\nForcing children to eat food they do not like can result in food aversions, which will make them more \u201cpicky\u201d. If they don\u2019t associate that negative experience with eating that food product they may even like the food in the future. These are basic principles of operant conditioning. MIL will achieve the opposite of what she is intending.", "NTA. I get it, my 4 year old exists on chicken nuggets and spite some days. He\u2019s a super picky eater and forcing him to eat would just make it worse. On the bright side my 8 year old was the same way, and we didn\u2019t force anything. Now she tries everything on her own.", "NTA, its not like you gave her ice cream i stead. She\u2019s eating veggies, and thats what matters. Thats a stupid hill your mil\u2019s chosen to die on", "OP you literally were forced into an unhealthy relationship with food because of your mum's rules. How on earth is protecting your kid from the same bullshit an AH move.\n\nMore Importantly, your kid saw you have her back. And good on your husband. A lot of people would prioritize 'family peace' over your kids mental health.\n\nGood for you for standing up for your principles and kid.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It is not about food. It is about who makes the parenting decisions for your children. MIL needs to learn NOW that she cannot just take over whenever she disagrees with you or it will not stop.", "NTA. Your MIL was out of line.", "NTA - it's actually better to allow a child to figure out likes and dislikes on their own terms, and doing it that way usually fosters more varied eating down the line.\n\nThe rule for trying everything on one's plate typically goes hand in hand with he rule that you do not have to finish everything on a plate if someone else served you. MIL do not get to pick and choose if she's going to pull that one.", "NTA and no kid should be forced to eat something they don't want to. Its not like your daughter wasn't eating no veggies. Kids taste buds evolve and there are phases when they like and dislike something. As adults we choose what we like and kids should be offered the same level unless its just unhealthy stuff which isn't the case here. So your MIL was completely out of line and tell her that she had her chance with parenting with your husband and when it comes to your kids, you make the rules. Any problem she has is her own and you can tell her that you won't be taking any parenting advice from her.", "NTA, your child, your rules.\n\nSide note - I\u2019ve a little experience with anorexia, and have never heard of parents encouraging eating being any type of a precursor (sans forcing gluttony of course). Had a friend and coworker lose his daughter to it some years ago, was tragic. I\u2019d have leaned opposite based on my limited knowledge - encouragement to consume being helpful instead of harmful. Learn something new every day!", "NTA\n\nYour and your husband have an agreed approach to how you patent your kids, and it seems to be a really healthy approach to food, something you've clearly given a huge amount of thought to because of your own experiences.\n\nYour MIL is way out of line, and if you decide on no more shared mealtimes until she both apologises and accepts your mealtime / food rules in full, you would not be out of line.", "This is enough to go NC with MIL.\n\nNTA", "NTA - my mother was like this with us growing up and tries it with my children.

But just in case it's helpful for OP for the future, I'll just chime in to say the science suggests that asking kids to try one small bite of each food on offer can be a good thing--that's how they learn to like stuff. Now a policy of clean your plate is abusive imo, and we know it's bad for kids. But asking/encouraging them to try a bite is how they grow their palate. So the rule MIL was suggesting is developmentally sound, and is unlikely to lead to problems with food such as the one you experienced. Kids typically need to try a new food about 7x before they start getting used to it. However, it's still totally your right as a parent not to implement such a rule, and again, you know your child best.
