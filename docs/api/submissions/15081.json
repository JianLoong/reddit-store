MIL saw that we had not included two of the veggies and went and added a small amount of each to her plate. She then told my daughter to try at least everything on her plate. My daughter said she doesn't like them (this is when my husband and I heard what MIL was doing because we had already started digging in and helping our 2 year old). We told MIL to stop and she doesn't need to eat those. MIL argued that they were on her plate and every kid needs the rule that you need to at least try a bite of everything. I told her it was not our rule and I did not put those things on my daughter's plate. She said she did because she should eat them. My husband told her to leave it alone. She told my daughter yet again to eat the broccoli and sprouts and I told her she cannot force my child to eat something she doesn't want.\n\nMIL yelled and told me I am going to raise a picky eater with a bad attitude toward food if I didn't stop catering to her like that.

MIL and him argued it out until my husband and I left early.\n\nSome BG info that is somewhat relevant. I was diagnosed with OCD and anorexia when I was 13. I had a very unhealthy relationship with food my whole childhood. Part of that, it is believed, was due to how strict my parents were about food. They did not believe you could dislike a piece of food and would always insist I eat everything and eat it all up. They would berate me, yell at me and intimidate me into eating the stuff I did not like. It created some bad compulsions that led to me starving myself through a large portion of my childhood. I was removed from my parents thanks to my grandparents stepping in when at the age of 13 I passed out in school and was rushed to the hospital. I was malnourished, weak as a preemie kitten and I did almost lose my life because of it. It took several years for any kind of healthy attitude to food to begin and I am very much still a work in progress. So MIL saying what she did really upset my husband because MIL is aware of what I went through and that I of all people do know what an unhealthy attitude to food is like.\n\nDespite all this, my telling MIL she couldn't force my daughter to eat something started off a big chain reaction and I wonder if I'm TA for saying it to her like that and whether I could have made things less explosive.", "created_utc": 1681813925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qis9c/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_cannot_force_my_child/", "score": 578, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, forcing a child to eat specific food which they do not like and will not pose a risk to health by not eating it is out of line. Especially considering MIL knows your history with food. \n\nForcing children to eat food they do not like can result in food aversions, which will make them more \u201cpicky\u201d.

Your MIL was out of line.", "NTA - it's actually better to allow a child to figure out likes and dislikes on their own terms, and doing it that way usually fosters more varied eating down the line.\n\nThe rule for trying everything on one's plate typically goes hand in hand with he rule that you do not have to finish everything on a plate if someone else served you. MIL do not get to pick and choose if she's going to pull that one.", "NTA and no kid should be forced to eat something they don't want to. Its not like your daughter wasn't eating no veggies. Kids taste buds evolve and there are phases when they like and dislike something. As adults we choose what we like and kids should be offered the same level unless its just unhealthy stuff which isn't the case here. So your MIL was completely out of line and tell her that she had her chance with parenting with your husband and when it comes to your kids, you make the rules.

Now a policy of clean your plate is abusive imo, and we know it's bad for kids. But asking/encouraging them to try a bite is how they grow their palate.

Said it wasn't to bad. Never felt a need to see if he was right.", "I mean, I love liver and onions. No sauce, just pan fried liver with some caramelized onions, but it's a divisive dish. Offal as a whole tends to be pretty divisive.", "What if we withheld the sauce", "This is exactly what happened with my husband.    He learned to like so many new foods as an adult once he found out, not everyone cooks like his mom.", "The thing here is that those vegetables aren't new.  OP and the kids already know the kids don't like them.", "My summer camp tried to do that to me. They wouldn't let me make a sandwich until I ate a baked bean. I ended up going home a couple pounds lighter and starving. Not a great idea for a kid with ARFID.", "my family had the one bit rule too. (and still does for my nieces.)\n\nthey get a \"great job\" for having tried the new food. sometimes they love it. sometimes they don't. but they tried it.\n\nand i give a lot of credit to not just my parents but our extended family- everyone has always excepted that everyone will sorta eat what they'll eat. (my aunt was infamous for the fact that meals at her house- when her kids where young- always had pasta and chicken breasts/cutlets, in addition to the meal, so whoever joined for dinner could eat something.)", "True, but if this was the first time with such a sensitive topic, I can see how it snowballed. Treat it as a learning experience - it sounds like MIL is going to be a difficult customer about \"advice\" raising kids. The \"cheerful aggressiveness\" works. \n\nIf she's pushy \\*towards\\* the kids, they might have to implement a \"one strike and we're leaving\" policy. Not dramatically, just calmly. \"Mom, we talked about this. We're going now.\" And then talk on the phone later, if necessary.\n\nI had several \"your aunt is being rude, so we're going to go home now,\" incidents in my childhood. It was a little confusing because often I didn't know what she was being rude \\*about\\*, but hey, if I was rude at a party I had to go home too, so it made sense.", "It\u2019s not bitter TO YOU. It is bitter to other people.", "There's likely a spectrum amongst super tasters too, actually. I definitely could taste the chemical in science class, but I don't find very much of anything too sweet and many super tasters do have issues with sweet as well as bitter. I really hated broccoli as a little kid, though, and it and liver are the only two things I've ever cried over being made to eat.", "We\u2019ll just take his word for it.", "Still good. As long as it's seasoned.", "My mother made me sit at the table when I was 4 until I ate my brussel sprouts. I sat there the entire weekend and slept at the table. When they started to grow mold after 2 days, she finally threw them away. I know that some kids (stubborn like me) are NOT going to eat certain foods no matter what. \n\nI'm not a picky eater. There are just a few things I will not eat, no matter what. NTA. And I'm sure your kids will be fine. Brussel sprouts are not an indicator of picky eaters. People literally have a gene that makes certain things taste unedible, and brussel sprouts are one of those things (yes, I am aware that the GMO sprouts now supposedly make them taste better to people with that gene, but they still taste awful to some of us).", "New, in this context, is the first 40 exposures. Without repeated exposures, a kid will never grow their palate. Plus carrots at grandma's are very different from carrots at home, and we want kids to try different cooking methods etc to perhaps find one they like.\n\nAs long as there aren't allergies or other medical needs to consider, tasting one bite won't hurt a kid. Teaching a kid to be polite, to care about people's feelings, how to handle a dinner they don't love (someday they'll have business meals, in laws, etc) is important too.  \n\nWe had the two bite rule, our kid is now a very adventurous eater.  Furthermore we teach our kid to be a good guest - try a bite and if you don't like it, mum will feed you at home after, or you can eat the bits you do like.  \n\nIt didnt have to escalate into a huge conflict. There were many other ways to handle that situation.", "Reminds me of a girl I knew who's parents did the same to her sister. \nAnd eating seafood for her was always forced regardless of how she felt. \n\nTurns out she's horrifically allergic to seafood. Like. Shouldn't be in the same house as where seafood exists allergic.", "My stepmother would just start spanking. Eventually, you learn to choke down the peas because you don\u2019t want your butt to hurt more.", "mil pushed it though. The parents and the kid said no so mil should have dropped it and not tried to force a kid to eat something they don't want. neither you nor mil know how many times the kid has tried brussel sprouts and how recent her last attempt was. only the kid and the parents know.", "Yeah what\u2019s going on is that MIL is a pushy and overbearing host who thinks it\u2019s her place to dictate, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s awesome of OP to demonstrate that her kids don\u2019t have to follow the demands of self-involved adults just because they\u2019re being pushy. Autonomy, consent, respect. Maybe grandma should brush up on those basics if she\u2019s going to attempt to mentor children.", "I knew he was going to beat me for a million other things, so I stayed at the table.  I was picky but we don't know which came first, the food abuse or pickiness. I do know that when mom had to go out of town when I was about two, he refused to feed me because I didn't like what he offered. Apparently I drank from the bathtub for two days. She never knew until things ended.  It's no wonder I'm slightly feral even now that I'm old.", "This power struggle was between the mum and the mil, though, and that's the unfortunate part.  The kids had to see a much bigger deal being made than was needed, so they'll be even less likely to try things in future.", "Yeah, I did the same. Kid eats almost nothing. It absolutely varies by kid.\n\nNow that my kid is almost 13, he has started requesting to try previously disliked things, something we have been encouraging.", "and thats all on mil. SHE pushed, SHE got angry first. She made an issue where there was none."]}
