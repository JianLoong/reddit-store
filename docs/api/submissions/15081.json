MIL saw that we had not included two of the veggies and went and added a small amount of each to her plate. She then told my daughter to try at least everything on her plate. My daughter said she doesn't like them (this is when my husband and I heard what MIL was doing because we had already started digging in and helping our 2 year old). We told MIL to stop and she doesn't need to eat those. MIL argued that they were on her plate and every kid needs the rule that you need to at least try a bite of everything. I told her it was not our rule and I did not put those things on my daughter's plate. She said she did because she should eat them. My husband told her to leave it alone. She told my daughter yet again to eat the broccoli and sprouts and I told her she cannot force my child to eat something she doesn't want.\n\nMIL yelled and told me I am going to raise a picky eater with a bad attitude toward food if I didn't stop catering to her like that.

MIL and him argued it out until my husband and I left early.\n\nSome BG info that is somewhat relevant. I was diagnosed with OCD and anorexia when I was 13. I had a very unhealthy relationship with food my whole childhood. Part of that, it is believed, was due to how strict my parents were about food. They did not believe you could dislike a piece of food and would always insist I eat everything and eat it all up. They would berate me, yell at me and intimidate me into eating the stuff I did not like. It created some bad compulsions that led to me starving myself through a large portion of my childhood. I was removed from my parents thanks to my grandparents stepping in when at the age of 13 I passed out in school and was rushed to the hospital. I was malnourished, weak as a preemie kitten and I did almost lose my life because of it. It took several years for any kind of healthy attitude to food to begin and I am very much still a work in progress. So MIL saying what she did really upset my husband because MIL is aware of what I went through and that I of all people do know what an unhealthy attitude to food is like.\n\nDespite all this, my telling MIL she couldn't force my daughter to eat something started off a big chain reaction and I wonder if I'm TA for saying it to her like that and whether I could have made things less explosive.", "created_utc": 1681813925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qis9c/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_cannot_force_my_child/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are absolutely correct. MIL is wrong.", "You're being good parents & respecting your children by listening to what they do & don't like. You're NTA because you were & are right.

However, forcing a child to eat specific food which they do not like and will not pose a risk to health by not eating it is out of line. Especially considering MIL knows your history with food. \n\nForcing children to eat food they do not like can result in food aversions, which will make them more \u201cpicky\u201d.

Your MIL was out of line.", "NTA - it's actually better to allow a child to figure out likes and dislikes on their own terms, and doing it that way usually fosters more varied eating down the line.\n\nThe rule for trying everything on one's plate typically goes hand in hand with he rule that you do not have to finish everything on a plate if someone else served you. MIL do not get to pick and choose if she's going to pull that one.", "NTA and no kid should be forced to eat something they don't want to. Its not like your daughter wasn't eating no veggies. Kids taste buds evolve and there are phases when they like and dislike something. As adults we choose what we like and kids should be offered the same level unless its just unhealthy stuff which isn't the case here. So your MIL was completely out of line and tell her that she had her chance with parenting with your husband and when it comes to your kids, you make the rules. Any problem she has is her own and you can tell her that you won't be taking any parenting advice from her.", "NTA, your child, your rules.\n\nSide note - I\u2019ve a little experience with anorexia, and have never heard of parents encouraging eating being any type of a precursor (sans forcing gluttony of course). Had a friend and coworker lose his daughter to it some years ago, was tragic. I\u2019d have leaned opposite based on my limited knowledge - encouragement to consume being helpful instead of harmful.

Now a policy of clean your plate is abusive imo, and we know it's bad for kids. But asking/encouraging them to try a bite is how they grow their palate.

It *may* be her job to intervene if your child is malnourished or something (as your own grandparents did, OP) but not to make the judgment call on what veggies need to be eaten/tasted at a particular dinner. \n\nAlso, FWIW my own mother, who made me eat my veggies, has asked me not to enforce that same rule with my own kids when visiting her (my mother) because \u201cyou don\u2019t have to eat anything you don\u2019t want to at grandma\u2019s house.\u201d", "I had a bad relation with food when growing up for complete different reasons. Now I eat healthy to show my kids that even if you don't like it, you should try at least one bit. My kids one day day that they don't like broccoli and the next day they will eat it. \nIt's a difficult one", "NTA - most children don't like brussels sprouts! Asparagus, mushrooms, olives, kale, bitter greens- these are things they might like later in life, especially if they don't have hang ups about them from their childhood.", ">Firstly because I think you're right - forcing a kid to eat food they don't like will put them off it. Many kids don't like Brussel Sprouts and Broccoli at your daughter's age because they taste too bitter to young children, and like them fine when they're older if not put off them for life by being forced to eat them too early.\n\n100% this. There are still vegetables that I don't like because of that very reason. Namely peas and lima beans. Might even like them if they're properly cooked, but instead they trigger a trauma response.", "NTA\n\nAgreed, tastes change. And it sounds like there are veggies that the daughter likes eating. Working on the assumption that the kids know they don't like it because they have tried it, MIL is out of line.", "Yep, my Dad made me eat stuff I didn't like when I was 9 or 10 (he made chili with <shudder> pinto beans in it).  I am 53 and still gag when eating similarly textured legumes, don't ask how I respond to people trying to feed me pinto beans, cause I don't want the ban hammer.", "Liver and onions is a divisive dish that would probably suit this purpose well.", "My parents created an unhealthy environment surrounding food. I was a literal child. So yes, it was their fault.", "Because she already knows that.", "My kids have never met my parents. This is my husband's parents.", "Mushrooms are the biggest trigger for me. Can't have them and they cannot be on my plate. But I am at a point now where others can eat them without my being uncomfortable. I'll never ever try them again though, no matter how they are cooked.\n\nOh yeah, those are the only two she doesn't eat and she had mostly veggies on her plate that day but MIL still wasn't happy.", "My kids are still encouraged to try something. But my daughter knew she didn't like those two vegetables, we left those off her plate for that very reason. I don't see that as extremist.", "I don't think the \"try just one bite\" thing stands when the kid's already tried it and knows that they do not like it and do not want to eat it.", "Actually, the current science doesn't support this. It supports division of responsibility - parents are responsible for providing a healthy variety of foods, deciding what will be served and when, always including one food that feels 'safe' for their children. . Children are responsible for deciding what they eat and how much. \n\nThis allows children to enjoy mealtimes, completely free of pressure, and develop a healthy relationship with food in the way developmentally appropriate. \n\nTrying new foods is really confronting for most kids. SOME kids will do perfectly well being asked to take one bite of everything. But a lot will feel pressured and resist more and more. Some kids feel pressured by anyone commenting at all on what they're eating / not eating.\n\nIn division of responsibility they become familiar with foods by seeing them presented on the table over and over. If not pressured they'll eventually become curious and put something on their plate. They might not even eat it that time. They'll try things when they want to. Over time they'll become more interested in a larger variety of foods, in their own time and way without pressure. \n\nIt also includes regularly presenting 'junk' foods so they become less glamorous, and sometimes allowing children to eat as much of a 'junk' food as they want, to allow them to learn how to modify their intake.\n\nForcing children to try foods is not supported by science as an effective way to make them like them.", "[removed]", "Ok well that wasn't in any way described in your post. You said you simply noted your rules etc.", "dude it sounds like you've really done the hard work to recover from your ED. idk I could be wrong but it sounds like you've educated yourself about this & worked with professionals to build a healthy relationship to food.\n\nthis is such an invaluable thing for your kids. \n\nNTA and huge congrats!", "Watching your parents fight with grandma to the point you had to leave is not creating a \u201chealthy relationship with food\u201d either, though. \n\nI have a, let\u2019s say, *difficult* mother-in-law and my go-to has been aggressive cheerfulness. \u201cNo thanks, Sandy!\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re all set but thanks so much for offering!\u201d \u201cThanks for the advice, Sandy.\u201d \u201cI hear you and we\u2019re good!\u201d \n\nAnd then we just do whatever we were going to do anyway. The trick is to acknowledge the comment, fake appreciation for the advice, not say anything that can possibly be argued or negotiated, and change the subject quickly. Repeat, repeat, repeat. \n\nShe quickly found out she looks like an asshole arguing with \u201cThanks, we\u2019re good.\u201d \n\nI empathize with you a lot, and I\u2019m going with NTA, but there\u2019s absolutely no reason this fight should have escalated in front of your kids.", "That is understandable but since taste changes so much it would be a good idea to encourage them to try it every now and then (every half year maybe?) my taste changed so much and I'm glad my parents taught me to try things again because it really. Stuck into adulthood and I am way more willing to try something made a different way or have things I am neutral towards now that used to be an absolute no go", "It\u2019s still good to occasionally present it again (without comment) and have a policy that they have to try one bite. This allows for their palate to develop and it\u2019s good to encourage them to try stuff again.", "My anorexia was not about me wanting to be thin. It was never the thoughts I had regarding it. And yes, plenty develop it for others reasons but there is no single reason someone will develop it. My parents were downright abusive to me over food and it became a bigger problem for me.", "My grandpa did that with me when I was learning how to eat again. I had so much anxiety and issues over wasted food that if I couldn't eat something he would do it for me and over time he didn't need to. But it sure helped me.", "What a great grandpa! My grandparents were the only compassionate ones in the family when it came to my food issues and it's honestly thanks to them I overcame a lot of my negative food triggers as an adult. I was in my late twenties and my grandfather was still sitting there beaming at me proudly when he saw me try a food he knows I used to hate as a kid lol. \n\nMy parents were a lot like yours. I was born with some pretty severe digestive issues that carried over well into my childhood, leaving me with some severe sensory issues with food and a tendency to get HORRIFICALLY sick after eating.  My parents were the \"you'll sit at that table and clear that plate you selfish, ungrateful, dramatic little brat\" type and  would routinely scream at me, mock me, and berate me while I sobbed and gagged down food I KNEW was going to make me sick out one end or the other (sometimes both...) after. \n\nAs an adult I found out I have Celiac and am lactose intolerant but as a kid, I was just branded a \"picky eater.\" It really messed up my relationship with food for a long time and if anything it made me even MORE food avoidant and picky. One thing I've told my husband is, we are NEVER going to be those parents to our children!", "Your grandpa sounds like an amazing, smart and very kind man.", "Your grandpa is a superhero. Getting misty eyed here but don't tell anyone and spoil my mean reputation.", "We fed our kids all the vegetable first foods first when they started eating baby food.  Then we did the fruits.  This led to kids who eat damned near everything.", "This doesn\u2019t always work.  Sure sometimes it does, but it\u2019s just as likely not to.  Sincerely an infant/toddler teacher and nanny of multiple decades.  I currently nanny 2 toddlers.  1 started out eating veg only, then added fruit, then she ate everything, now she\u2019s more picky.  But she still eats a fairly wide variety of food and will try almost anything.  The other started out with veg and stayed on only veg for months because he was super picky.  Then he ate more.  Now he\u2019s back to picky and would live on oranges, applesauce, beets, and squash puree if we let him.  Sometimes he\u2019ll add yogurt or cottage cheese."]}
