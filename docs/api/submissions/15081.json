MIL saw that we had not included two of the veggies and went and added a small amount of each to her plate. She then told my daughter to try at least everything on her plate. My daughter said she doesn't like them (this is when my husband and I heard what MIL was doing because we had already started digging in and helping our 2 year old). We told MIL to stop and she doesn't need to eat those. MIL argued that they were on her plate and every kid needs the rule that you need to at least try a bite of everything. I told her it was not our rule and I did not put those things on my daughter's plate. She said she did because she should eat them. My husband told her to leave it alone. She told my daughter yet again to eat the broccoli and sprouts and I told her she cannot force my child to eat something she doesn't want.\n\nMIL yelled and told me I am going to raise a picky eater with a bad attitude toward food if I didn't stop catering to her like that. My husband became enraged and told his mom she was out of line, cruel and she owed us an apology. MIL and him argued it out until my husband and I left early.\n\nSome BG info that is somewhat relevant. I was diagnosed with OCD and anorexia when I was 13. I had a very unhealthy relationship with food my whole childhood. Part of that, it is believed, was due to how strict my parents were about food. They did not believe you could dislike a piece of food and would always insist I eat everything and eat it all up. They would berate me, yell at me and intimidate me into eating the stuff I did not like. It created some bad compulsions that led to me starving myself through a large portion of my childhood. I was removed from my parents thanks to my grandparents stepping in when at the age of 13 I passed out in school and was rushed to the hospital. I was malnourished, weak as a preemie kitten and I did almost lose my life because of it. It took several years for any kind of healthy attitude to food to begin and I am very much still a work in progress. So MIL saying what she did really upset my husband because MIL is aware of what I went through and that I of all people do know what an unhealthy attitude to food is like.\n\nDespite all this, my telling MIL she couldn't force my daughter to eat something started off a big chain reaction and I wonder if I'm TA for saying it to her like that and whether I could have made things less explosive.", "created_utc": 1681813925, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qis9c/aita_for_telling_my_mil_she_cannot_force_my_child/", "score": 1886, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, forcing a child to eat specific food which they do not like and will not pose a risk to health by not eating it is out of line. Especially considering MIL knows your history with food. \n\nForcing children to eat food they do not like can result in food aversions, which will make them more \u201cpicky\u201d.

Your MIL was out of line.", "NTA - it's actually better to allow a child to figure out likes and dislikes on their own terms, and doing it that way usually fosters more varied eating down the line.\n\nThe rule for trying everything on one's plate typically goes hand in hand with he rule that you do not have to finish everything on a plate if someone else served you. MIL do not get to pick and choose if she's going to pull that one.", "NTA and no kid should be forced to eat something they don't want to. Its not like your daughter wasn't eating no veggies. Kids taste buds evolve and there are phases when they like and dislike something. As adults we choose what we like and kids should be offered the same level unless its just unhealthy stuff which isn't the case here. So your MIL was completely out of line and tell her that she had her chance with parenting with your husband and when it comes to your kids, you make the rules. Any problem she has is her own and you can tell her that you won't be taking any parenting advice from her.", "NTA, your child, your rules.\n\nSide note - I\u2019ve a little experience with anorexia, and have never heard of parents encouraging eating being any type of a precursor (sans forcing gluttony of course). Had a friend and coworker lose his daughter to it some years ago, was tragic. I\u2019d have leaned opposite based on my limited knowledge - encouragement to consume being helpful instead of harmful.

Now a policy of clean your plate is abusive imo, and we know it's bad for kids. But asking/encouraging them to try a bite is how they grow their palate.

It'd be one thing if she said she didn't like them without ever even eating them (Green eggs and ham!), but you said she tried it and didn't like it.\n\nAnd that's fine. Taste buds eventually change and there may come a point where her taste buds develop to the point where she tries it again and suddenly thinks \"hey, this is pretty good.\" I used to love hard candies, sour sweets, chips and now I barely eat them anymore. Better to leave it as a simple \"tried it and didn't like it\" because that could always change. But when it becomes \"was forced to eat it even though I didn't like it,\" that would probably give her an extreme aversion to those foods.", "If you are curious, here is an open access relatively recent review article on this topic https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/2/107", "Not every kid is going to be the same.

If you know your child tried something a lot of times and still doesn't like it, or if your child has sensory issues, or if they like 99% of foods but not one specific one, that should all affect your judgment. But overall, asking kids to try a tiny bite of something before rejecting it is generally a good and science-supported strategy at raising kids who are willing to eat lots of different things. Again, it's not going to work for everyone. Aggregates do not tell you about individuals.\n\nHere is an open access relatively recent review. The key points they hit on are that trying a food repeatedly helps kids get used to it and increases the probability they will like it.

On the other hand, I understand you have had (and still do as you said) issues with food but what you're doing doesn't seem the solution either. You're telling them they are free to pick around a plate that has been served to them (in this case by your MIL, but it could have been anyone else). I'm not saying you should force them to eat a lot of everything they don't like, but they have to learn that the polite way to act is to at least eat some of it. You will have children that grow up being picky eaters if you don't find a balance between \"not a single bite\" to \"eat a whole plate\". I think you're biased by what happened to you so I recommend going to your pediatrician or nurse (some countries leave the nutritional part to nurses) and talk to them about your struggles and how you want to avoid it happening to your children and ask for tips and a meal plan or something of the sorts so you can all have healthy complete meals. They might even give you tips on how to \"hide\" foods they don't like into foods they do like. Example: my brother and I used to loathe peppers so my mom made these huge paellas with really small minced peppers so we would eat them and between the flavour being covered by the other ingredients and the super small sized pieces, we ate it easily. As we've grown older we eat practically everything besides allergies. My mom found her way to make us eat everything we needed but wouldn't eat and helped us ease into eating every kind of food.

I remember eating off a diving kid plate and once I would get to something I knew I didn't like, or had extra trauma around in that moment, it could pause the entire session because all I could think was how I was wasting it and how that was disgusting of me, how I should be ashamed, etc. Stuff my parents said. Him doing that for me still makes me want to cry sometimes.", ">MIL argued that they were on her plate and every kid needs the rule that you need to at least try a bite of everything. I told her it was not our rule and I did not put those things on my daughter's plate. She said she did because she should eat them. My husband told her to leave it alone. She told my daughter yet again to eat the broccoli and sprouts and I told her she cannot force my child to eat something she doesn't want.\r  \n\r  \nMIL yelled and told me I am going to raise a picky eater with a bad attitude toward food if I didn't stop catering to her like that. My husband became enraged and told his mom she was out of line, cruel and she owed us an apology. MIL and him argued it out until my husband and I left early.\n\nNTA you make your parenting rules.\n\nBut your MIL isn't wrong, in that not making your kids at least try new foods will turn them into picky eaters.\n\nI understand you had a bad relationship with food and bad experiences. So you certainly won't go extremely bad like your parents did with you, but remember to not let that reaction make you over-correct to the opposite extreme. Kids do need limits and encouragement for balanced eating habits.", "I was a member of the clean plate club as a child. I have a weight problem because of it, in my 60s and still feel I must eat everything on my plate. Because of this my children could not eating if full but they \"got hungry \" they have to eat the food on their plate. I never made them eat food they did not like ever.", "I think the key is to keep putting it on the plate but don\u2019t force them. Eventually they might try it?", "NTA\n\nYour daughter already established that she didn't like those vegetables so what's the point in trying again right now? She will when she wants, for now she already eat other vegetables so it's not like she's just eating nuggets or whatever", "NTA - I\u2019ll never understand adults who won\u2019t let children do perfectly normal things that adults do all of the time. Adults have the freedom to choose which vegetables they like and which ones they don\u2019t. They also don\u2019t have to eat anything they don\u2019t like. Why is your MIL trying to impose different rules on your child? It\u2019s almost bullying.", "NTA. This is how children get a DCA. Never force them.", "Both my kids try new foods all the time. We have always introduced new stuff to them. We just don't make them eat the stuff they don't like.", "She already tried those things and didn't like them. My kids are always up for trying new foods.", "A health visitor told me ordinarily you have to present a food around 11 times before they\u2019ll try it. Not sure if it works but there\u2019s no harm in it sitting on the plate."]}
