I didn\u2019t think this would blow up as fast as it did or as much as it did. I\u2019ve been wanting to reply to so many of you but I\u2019ve been increasingly more unwell as the day goes on. I had to log off work early just to recover so seeing the validation and reassurance is unbelievably relieving. My boss is also letting me take a day or two off if I need. I work from home for obvious reasons but I might take her up on it as I\u2019ve been so low energy. \n\nJust to note, John is already in therapy and while I can\u2019t find the person who made the comment, I will not be reaching out to his therapist but instead finding one for us or asking if I can join him with his. I didn\u2019t realize it could come off as me being sneaky and I don\u2019t want to add more crazy to this circus. \n\nThe only thing he\u2019s said to me is letting me know that a package has arrived for me. I said to put it aside and he just left a thumbs up emoji. According to my neighbor/friend he bumped into John and John said he took the day off. The only reason I know this is because my neighbor (who wasn\u2019t there when it happened) asked if I was okay. John said that he hopes so and that I wasn\u2019t there before ending the conversation. They reached out to me and I let them know I was fine but didn\u2019t go into details. \n\nI don\u2019t really know how to update this if anything happens later on this week but I\u2019ll look it up. I have a feeling I\u2019ll need people to talk to and right now, I have only my friend who is insisting I go straight to moving out.  \n\nSomeone also mentioned possibly showing him this thread and I am actually considering it. We both keep our circle small for different reasons so having an outside opinion might help.\n\nThank you again and hopefully I have something better to update you all with. \n\n\u2014\n\nI (29f) am married to \u201cJohn\u201d(29m)(3yrs married dated for 7yrs). Without going into too much detail I have multiple disabilities that leave me needing a wheelchair on occasion. Its genetic so I decided early in life that I didnt want to have kids because of it. I dont want to pass it on and it would be a huge risk to my body. My mom passed away when I was born and she also had it. John has always understood/agreed as he never saw himself as a dad. He and his brothers went into foster care due to his parents substance abuse. They were found alone fending for themselves.\n\nHes not sure about his father but his mother is back in his life after being clean for the past two years. Im happy for her as it is a huge problem in our state and not easy. My MIL has always been quirky but sometimes makes comments about my disabilities. \n\nRecently she has been asking when we were having kids as she is desperate to be a grandma. I explained my side multiple times. John has also explained his side how he has always said no to kids and that we spoke about it multiple times before marriage. Lately she has been very persistent which I ignored.\n\nOn NYE we had a small party and since it was my own home I didnt need to use my chair. My MIL came and when she saw me was visibly upset. Shes mostly seen me in a chair (especially in the winter time as it can affect me more) and said that seeing me out of my chair surprised her. Again I ignored it its something Im used to.\n \nIn my friend group we do a NYE wish and share it out loud. When it was my MILs turn her exact words were \u201cI wish for (my name) to finally put John first and give him the family he deserves\u201d and I froze. When I asked why she would say that she said that she felt that I was lying to John about my illness and faking it to avoid giving him a kid and called me a bad wife.\n\nI explained that I could pass away like my mom did and she said that it happens and if it did that she would take care of the baby. I admit that I was impulsive but hearing her be so casual about it made me rage especially since John wasnt intervening. Apparently she and John had been speaking about it as she believes he has to pass on his legacy and that Im holding him back.\n\nI f*king lost it. I said \u201ctheres no legacy to pass. You chose drugs over your kids and then left them. Even if there was a chance of me having kids I wouldnt leave them to a drug addict that thinks my kids are there for her to try again\u201d stormed out of the room and I went to bed crying.\n\nYesterday John said that he had been reconsidering the idea of kids because he wanted to be a better dad than his. I told him that if it was important that we could talk about fostering/adopting but he said MIL said they wouldnt be blood related so it didnt count. He and a few of my friends think I took it too far and while I somewhat agree I also feel like the idea of putting my life at risk because she wants a redo shouldnt be so casually glossed over.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704311089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xs319/aita_for_throwing_my_mils_addiction_in_her_face/", "score": 437, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Raging let's her know she can push your buttons and makes you look weak. She'll exploit that.\n\nShe's ignoring your boundaries, so properly set them. Tell her what action you will take if she brings this up again. I think not having her around is a better option. No contact.\n\nYou also need to have a careful heart-to-heart with your husband. He's allowing her to influence his thoughts and drastically impact your relationship. He needs help. He seems codependent and trying to please/appease his mother.  At the very least, he needs to help you. And he needs to understand that not using drugs is a low bar to have his mother in his life.

You have no need to reconsider your stance on pregnancy and *definitely* not due to them treating you like shit.\n\nHe's the problem because he's talking to his mother about family planning and not you.\n\nBecause when you were blatantly insulted in front of a crowd of people he took his mother's side on it.\n\nAnd because he's only considering himself and his interests in this equation, as if you weren't his wife but merely a womb he's considering using. He's acting like whether you have kids is his decision and his alone and yes, as if you not birthing his required amount of progeny on demand is \"being a bad wife\". It's NOT.

I ruined my mobility for other people's dreams and a doctor who lied to me about how it would improve my pain - it is so bitter. My parents also urged me to have a baby so they could \"try again\" - my parents are narcissists and I'm no contact/low contact with them because they do not value my life.

No way I don\u2019t think I\u2019d speak to her again at all. And she needs to apologize to you, although I highly doubt she will. \n\nAs others are saying, your husband is a big problem.

He and his mother talk and talk and talk and then he fucks with whatever birth control you're on if you haven't already been sterilized. Now you're pregnant.

Could you get an abortion, divorce, assistance should this scenario happen?\n\nI'm not one to always say \"dump him\" but seriously AITA tests the limits. You two need to have a serious discussion on what he's saying and how he's changing. You MIL needs to be pushed back with a 10 foot pole. Therapy, mediation, and some serious separation has to happen. She was out of his life for years. Her coming back and controlling him and him having some need to appease mommy in case she takes off again...this isn't a good life.
