My husband has a thirteen year old daughter with his high school sweetheart. They met at a prestigious private school my husband had a scholarship to, and the pregnancy was a big scandal at the time. My husband is successful in his career and so am I, but we are nowhere near rich. His ex comes from a very wealthy family and lives a highly luxurious life. Shes a bit snobby but has been kind to me throughout the time we\u2019ve known each other. We just come from two COMPLETELY different worlds. We get his daughter for a week. We have a three year old. \n\n\nLast week when my stepdaughter was over, we went to the stable she keeps her horse so we could go horseback riding. She has a horse but she doesn't see it often during the school year so I told my husband we should make it a habit to bring her when we can. We went and she was riding her horse and things were fine. I didnt even notice her outfit but it was designer head to toe. Her boots got really muddy and she ditched them there. We didnt find out until we were in the car and noticed she had only socks. She threw them in the trash! We were 15 minutes awya and I didnt feel like turning back, especially knowing she has hundreds of shoes at home\u2026 whats one pair? I was shocked but I know shes into fashion and they were \u201cfrom seasons ago\u201d so she didnt care. \n\n\nWhen we sent her back a few days later her mom calls furious. She said those shoes werent her daughters but from her own closet and they were  \u201cvintage Hermes riding boots\u201d and they were in good condition and she cant believe we would let her wear those to the stable, let alone let her leave them in the trash. She said it would take weeks for new ones to arrive. We just couldnt believe her anger. We know she throws away clothes and shoes like no other so why complain? Just because theyre \u201cvintage\u201d? She wants us to pay for half. She said that if they were from last season or from the past few years she wouldnt care, but they were vintage and finding them in her size makes them expensive and blah blah. My husband agreed to settle the peace. He sent her half (she sent the invoice) and she needed ones in near perfect condition making the price 2k\u2026 my husband asked me to send him half so 500$ and I refused. Hes saying Im an asshole since I was there too and was the driver and refused to turn around for them even though we were fifteen minutes away.

Her mother needs to take this up with Stepdaughter, not you and your husband.  It's obvious Stepdaughter hasn't been raised to value anything at all.  That's not your fault.\n\nGoing forward, consider whether you want to back off on responsibilities with regard to Stepdaughter.  For instance, if you hadn't taken her to the stables, the shoes wouldn't have gotten dirty.  So, maybe your husband needs to be the parent entertaining his kid during his visitation so nothing can be your fault.", "NTA \u2014 if my daughter tossed her non-Hermes riding boots because they were muddy\u2026.  Grrrr.  Clean them when you clean your tack! That\u2019s part of horse care.", "NTA. \n\nThis literally has nothing to do with you. \n\nIf your husband wants to give his ex a thousand dollars, he should.  But this has absolutely nothing to do with you, what your stepdaughter wears riding or anywhere else is not your business, and you should not give one cent toward the new boots.", "NTA. The child's mother must stop sending such expensive items with her daughter, knowing that she is this careless with her belongings. And other people's belongings. I believe we once spent 2000$ on a downpayment for a second hand car ... For a pair of second hand boots that is just ridiculous. And a hobby the rich mum could pursue without your help in my opinion. Anyway, she is your husband's daughter so I don't see why you should have to pay.", "The daughter needs to be responsible for replacing them. She can do chores and such until she\u2019s worked them off. Paying the ex is just enabling her irresponsibility.", "ESH.\n\n**Stepdaughter** should not have thrown out the boots.\n\n**You** should have returned to the stable to pick up the boots when you found out your stepdaughter threw them out.   Even if you weren't aware of how expensive they were, this was a moment where you could have taught your daughter, by example, that you don't just throw things out.\n\nIf the boots were so danged valuable, then both your **stepdaughter** and **the ex** should have made it known that they were valuable.  It's unreasonable to expect you to identify designer boots.\n\nUltimately, though, you were the adult on the scene.  You made the wrong call when you decided not to go back for the boots.  So I think you bear most of the responsibility for their loss.", "NTA Your stepdaughter is 13. She is old enough to be responsible for her own shoes.", "NTA. your stepdaughter is old enough to know to not take shoes from her mother (she should be making it up to her mother, NOT you) your husband shouldn\u2019t have agreed to send her any money.", "ESH.\n\nThe stepdaughter sounds very spoiled.\n\nHer mother shouldn\u2019t be giving a child $2k vintage boots.\n\nYour husband shouldn\u2019t have demanded that you pay half.\n\nYou should have turned around, since you were only 15 minutes away.\n\nBoth you and your husband could have called the stable, asked them to locate the boots, and set them aside until you came back.", "NTA This woman is crazy to think you should pay for the boots. You had no control over stepdaughter picking up these boots. Also it was her mother who taught her to thoughtlessly throw things in the trash.", "People won't agree but yes, you should have turned around and got the boots or in the least called the stables and had them retrieve the boots. And because you didn't even try, you do owe the $500. Also vintage is different from every day fashion and you you should be able to Google it and learn. YTA", "YTA. Your step daughter is a minor and you know she's wearing designer clothes that could be worth a small fortune. Even non-designer riding boots aren't cheap. You go back grab the boots and let HER explain to her mother why they're covered in mud and destroyed. Even if it wasn't expensive designer stuff, if you didn't buy it for her and she wore it to an event you took her to, it goes back with her to her home for her mother to decide what to do with it. Self preservation, my dude. You're the one that refused to turn around to go grab the boots, you owe part of the replacement.", "ESH .You were only 15 minutes away. You should have turned back and made her walk in her socks through the mud and muck to retrieve the boots. Her dad didn't argue, so he's an AH, too.\n\nAnd your stepdaughter is old enough not to be tossing things away like that. Her mother has been letting her get away with it or she wouldn't have so blatantly done it this time.", "ESH, although everyone else more than you. Your stepdaughter for throwing away perfectly good shoes because they got dirty (!!), her mother for buying $2000 boots for a 13-year-old child, and you for not being willing to go back when you were only 15 minutes away. If you're going to take on ferrying kids around, you have some responsibility for going back for things they leave behind, and \"my shoes were dirty so I threw them away\" is obviously ridiculous and not something that's okay for a kid to do.", "NTA: 13 is old enough for daughter to have mentioned the shoes aren\u2019t hers. She said nothing and also decided on her OWN to throw them away KNOWING they are not hers. Husbands a mug for paying anything", "You definitely should have turned around to get them, even if they were non-designer boots they still would have been expensive and worth the return trip. \n\nAnd all of you should be teaching this kid the value of money!! Kid should be doing chores to work off some of the value or parents not buying any new clothes etc for her for a period of time as punishment. She needs to learn consequences and that you can\u2019t just throw away things for no good reason.", "ESH. She\u2019s a brat but 15 minutes away is nothing and you, as the adult, should have went back for them and then grounded her. If this is a problem you talk with her mother and father and say either they start disciplining their kid or you don\u2019t take her out alone.", "YTA. You could have chosen to turn around and teach your daughter a lesson about not throwing things out/wasting and generally not being a brat. Instead you said \"fuck it, she is a spoiled brat and they can afford more\"\n\nInstead of stepping up, you chose petty vindictiveness.", "NTA\n\nThis is ridiculous. *Her daughter* is responsible, which maker *her* responsible.", "ESH but you.  \n\nAt 13 the daughter should know better.\n\nThe fact that she didn't is on her primary caregiver, her birth mother.  \n\nFather should also know better, though, and if going back immediately REALLY wasn't an option, he should've called the stable to have the bag set aside for later pickup, AND had the daughter call the BM right away to confess.", "How come the 13yo isn\u2019t responsible for the shoes? \nIt\u2019s not on you if she took them without asking nor how she treated the shoes during her visit. \n\nSuggestion: tell them that If you\u2019re supposed to be in charge of her shoes then the mother needs to send a full inventory of everything the SD is packing so that unauthorized items can be filtered out and all other items checked back in at the end of a trip. \n\nI bet that will end her b fit quickly.", "ESH for raising a child like this. Wow.", "If you refused to turn around, YTA.", "ESH. Yes, your stepdaughter is old enough to keep up with her shoes, especially knowing they were her mother\u2019s and not her own. But as a fellow stepmom, I try to reasonably keep up with things my stepdaughter brings from her mom\u2019s house (meaning things we didn\u2019t pay for) especially things like shoes, coats, and more expensive items. Things I know her mother is going to want back. You mentioned she was wearing head-to-toe designer, so it never crossed your mind that maybe her mom would not want those shoes thrown in the trash? Yes, having to waste another 15 minutes driving back is annoying but it seems it would have been far less annoying then shelling out $1,000 to cover new boots.", "ESH (step-daughter for throwing them out, your husband for not doing his job as a father, and you for showing little regard to no care since it IS NOT YOUR ITEM!). You better hope she doesn't take you to court and with her financial resources and who she probably knows based on her family privilege. I wouldn't even play around, next thing you know she gets more than the cost of those boots in court. As a stepparent and most importantly her father, you both should have watched what she brought over to the house. It is not difficult to tell what can get dirty or not and then she threw them out and it's not like her dad bought them. You didn't even return to the stable to get them. Honestly, they just needed a good clean with shoe shampoo, conditioner, and protector. I would be pissed too because wake up as parents. Vintage Hermes boots are EXPENSIVE GURL! You won't care as you should until something similar happens to you. If there's one thing I have learnt is to never play around with the rich. The back story was also not necessary. Someone's expensive item got thrown out on YOUR WATCH and you don't give a damn.", "NTA you literally didn't do anything. She threw away her own shoes and told you they were unimportant. That's on her mom for loaning her vintage shoes without explaining how important they were to her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You chose to let her throw her shoes away and now you're trying to excuse how strange that is. Two completely different worlds and yet you fully agreed tossing her shoes was a-ok.  Especially when you know she wears upscale items.  \n\nYou're her step-parent. You're in a blended family. She is also your responsibility. You made the decision to leave the shoes there. You absolutely should be sharing the consequences of the poor decision you made. You figured she was just so stinking filthy rich she wouldn't care....you were wrong.", "I'm with NTA.

Is it the stepmom\u2019s responsibility to keep up with such things, no not necessarily. But in this situation, I would have asked some questions before just being like no big deal, throwing away designer shoes is totally reasonable behavior.", "NTA. But I would have driven back.

Where OP screwed up is not going back to get them, or calling the stable to see if someone could retrieve them, or asking her husband or the girl\u2019s mom if they were truly needed, or honestly anything other than just shrugging and driving home and then acting all shocked pikachu face when guess what mom didn\u2019t actually want designer boots thrown in the trash. Like yes the kid is totally being a brat but that doesn\u2019t absolve OP from any wrongdoing. Yes, dad and the biomom suck too for letting the daughter get away with such behavior.", "Stepparents should not punish stepchildren. They should let the bio parent do it.\n\nBut if she can't punish stepdaughter for trashing her shoes, then she cannot be responsible for stopping her from trashing her shoes. This was not an accident: this was a choice made by the stepdaughter, and the stepmother is right to not accept responsibility. Since stepdaughter's behavior is outside of her jurisdiction, she has neither the right nor the authority to control the girl's behavior, and she would be a fool to volunteer to clean up the messes made by this girl's bad behaviors.\n\nThe correct course of action is to refuse to discipline the girl, refuse to accept the consequences of the girl's behavior, and refuse to accept responsibility for cleaning up messes the girl causes when she misbehaves, unless someone other than the \"miserable trio\" (dad, biomom, stepdaughter) is affected.", "In what world is retrieving the boots punishing the stepdaughter? Like my dude, I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so hung up on my judgement since others have said the same or worse. But if OP had grabbed the boots she wouldn\u2019t have a husband asking her for $500 right now. And she could wash her hands of it and be like look your spoiled brat threw these in the trash but I grabbed them so now you two as her biological parents can deal with her behavior. And then she should probably refuse to take her riding anymore."]}
