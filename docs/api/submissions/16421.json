Still, my feelings are not hurt and we both laughed after she finished apologizing. \n\nYesterday she was getting dressed to go to an appointment and said she wanted to wear bright summer colors(she usually wears dark brown or black colors) She went through a few different colored outfits while I was in the room, I left out and came back to her dressed in dark brown and black. I busted out laughing pointing out that I thought it was funny that she was so dead set on wearing colors but ended up in the usual black and dark brown. She later told me that it hurt her that I laughed at her, of course I apologized and told her that it was not my intent and that I was deeply sorry.

I laughed at my wife's choice of dark clothing when she had stated she wanted to dress in bright summer clothes. 2.

I bet she was frustrated with nothing colorful feeling right on her, so she went with her default and was frustrated. Then you bop in and laugh, which just hit wrong.  You didn't mean harm and you apologized. Bad timing is all.", "NAH. You both communicated. You apologised and made amends. Move on babe.", "NAH. She was upset, you apologised, job done. Right?", "NAH - It was funny because it was unexpected. She said she\u2019d try different colors but fell back to what she\u2019s used to. You laughed in a \u201cha, that\u2019s so like you\u201d/endeared kind of way, not a way to make fun of her. But she expressed that she felt hurt and you apologized, so no one\u2019s an AH. Sounds like you two have a great and healthy relationship with an open line of communication.", "NAH - I am guessing that there was a reason she wasn't happy with any of the bright clothes that was making her feel badly (not that you could have realized that) and that's why your seemingly benign comment ending up hurting her feelings.", "Gonna go with nah.. kinda silly tbh.. you just pointed out the obvious, not sure why she would feel hurt?", "TBH, her fashion sense sounds like my wife's (wanting to do colors... always ends up in black)... We joke about it too.\n\n*But* the key to having a good relationship where you can joke about *almost* everything is being able to recognize when you nevertheless do cross a line, and apologize. Y TA... but seems like you already have done the right thing so seems like it is all good so maybe NAH in the end? Either way it shouldn't let it be an impediment to continuing your joking back and forth (unless it keeps happening, in which case you need a sidebar conversation about what has changed. She might have stuff *going on* which she has been hesitant to open up about?)", "Damn, a straight NAH. I was gonna say, don't laugh at your wife's choices, because you're one of them, but you didn't do anything wrong.", "NAH. I was chuckling by the end. You have apologized. And this wasnt meant in a malicious body/clothes shaming way. We all have off days. Prob what happened here. She was feeling defeated by colour and the comment prob just felt off in that moment.", "NAH:  I agree with you because it is kinda funny when people are dead set to do something different and go back to their comfort zone. Plus you apologized when you found out it hurt her.", "NAH. Just a bit of miscommunication and not enough for anyone to be labeled an AH", "So you had a minor squabble and it\u2019s since been resolved.

She sometimes says or does goofy things while not trying to be funny and we both laugh. The fact that she felt hurt this time really made me think I might be TA", "I love that phrase and I laugh at her choice of me all the time(I am one undeserving and lucky bastard)", "I think you may have missed the point. Normally my wife and I laugh at anything. When this happened she got upset which is atypical of her which led me to believe my laughter could have been a-holish which in turn led me to ask the community whether my laughter at her fashion choice made me an asshole. Sorry that it was not more dramatic.", "Appreciate the feedback.", "Nah, someone feeling hurt over an innocent remark doesn\u2019t make you an AH. It\u2019s impossible to predict with 100% accuracy how someone will take our jokes or comments, even with people you love or are very close to. You\u2019d only be the AH if you got angry at your wife and ridiculed her for being hurt while refusing to apologize. But you apologized for causing her hurt even when you didn\u2019t mean to."]}
