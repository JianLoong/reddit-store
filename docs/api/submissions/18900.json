That's not rude at all. Dating advances & pua style cold approaches come at a 50% risk of rejection and everyone who decides to gamble in a 'shoot your shot' context knows this fact. \n\nBut all the anger and disgust connected solely with his age is a bit OTT, assuming that you are an adult or older teen who could easily pass for an adult. If he gave the impression of being an entitled weirdo, pestering jerk who was very rude, tried anything criminal or made vulgar comments to you- that would be different. \n\nI'm only attracted to guys that are older than me and date with a minimum 15 year age gap.  I'm not interested in any dating/sexual involvement with guys in their 20s or teens and never have been. But I don't take it personally or get enraged when they politely approach me. Nor even worse try persuading me to change my dealbreakers for them because they are 'different from all the others'. Just make it clear that I'm not interested and walk away.", "NAH for the interaction. Are you aware of the age gap in the French President's relationship? They don't see it as anything inappropriate.

I hate the world has become so fragile that flirting has become \"predatory\". Get over yourself, say No and get on with life. \n\nThe dude shot his shot. That's what happened all the time back before everyone needed to lighten the F up.", "Well, if he was presenting himself as he did, you could have just said \"No thank you.\" nicely.   \nStill, NAH, because you're an adult, not some child. An older guy finding you attractive isn't wrong, and you have a right to turn him down too, and you didn't call him names or anything... Right?", "Not rude. If he was really into you and had game, he would've been able to spend more time with you, the age wouldn't have mattered and you probably would've stuck around to spend time with him, but you weren't really interested, had any expectations like that and probably knew his interest anyway.\n\nSo that's all on him. You owe him nothing.\n\nI'm 34, look early mid 20, have no hang ups about age, take all the rejections in stride as it's a part of life and know everything is putting yourself out there and opening yourself up to that rejection from the start, which he didn't because his intentions caught you off guard. Maybe if he said something earlier or gave noticeable and gave you time to adjust and warm up things might have been different but in doing that it opens things up to earlier rejection and potentially being seen as creep for even trying then.\n\nHe was likely trying to gauge interest and build up something before asking but in the moment, especially when it's not at all your intention to meet someone like that, let alone an older man, that's usually the hardest part.\n\nNo harm in him trying just as much as there's no harm in you rejecting him.  So long as he respected your boundaries and you were safe, there shouldn't be much to worry about. If he's anything like me, rejection can occur on a near daily basis so he may be totally used to it.", "NTA It was creepy.", "NTA. Creepy dudes count on us being taught to be \"polite\". Pffft. You don't owe anyone your phone number. He's a predator counting on your youth.  \n\nBTW, do go back to your class. If he is there do not feel awkward. He's the one who deserves to feel uncomfortable. If he tries again, tell him \"for the second time, I am not interested in dating you. My dad is younger than you! Please stop\". Don't yell, but say it loud enough for others to hear. \nF politeness.", "NTA\n\nWell Done you! Predators use social contacts, such as manners, to guilt trip their victims into extending contact, thereby giving them more opportunities to close with their victims.", "Yta. Not for saying no, but for coming on here and your description of the situation. You\u2019re an adult calling another adult a predator. Id say you\u2019re the creep.

No trickery or deception involved.", "That's why they used the adjective \"creepy\" and not \"all\"", "Then this doesn\u2019t apply to you, does it?", "Don't be ageist you biggot.", "Where in her story do you see him insisting after she walks away (says no)? Sounds like he made his perhaps poorly chosen advance and that was that NAH", "She showed she wasn\u2019t interested, he kept trying to persuade her, thus continuing the interaction. Which should have stopped after she indicated she didn\u2019t welcome his attention.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t realize calling behavior \u201cinappropriate\u201d came with a time requirement. How long does a man have to engage a woman who clearly isn\u2019t interested in him and is actively trying to leave his presence before he can officially be called predatory?", "Interesting that you see a man continuing to push a woman who\u2019s shown her discomfort with the situation as a \u201cgentleman\u201d.\n\nSays a lot about you, honestly.", "Duct taped in a trunk is your threshold for \"creepy\"? Tell me you're an oven without telling me.", "No means no?\n\nI hope every gay man you meet for the next 30 years hits on you and never takes your first no. \n\nThen come back and tell me how a gay man never taking your no and giving counter points is perfectly fine and acceptable. \n\n\nI bet you'd act like they shoved a dildo in your ass or whatever.", "There *is* no counterpoint. She said no. End of story. Also his \u201ccounterpoint\u201d completely disregarded her feelings on the age matter, which gets another point in the creep column", "Uh, 1) he doesn't get a \"counter point,\" it's not a hostage negotiation. She said no thanks, she's not interested.\n\n2) \"It's not a problem for me\" isn't even a counter point, because it's a problem for her so it's irrelevant. Why would she care if some saggy-balled middle aged creep sees no problem with trying to fuck girls younger than his kids? Of course he doesn't, he's gross.", "By his 40s he should know her pointing it out was her saying it was an issue.", "6 seconds.", "Calm down, OP won't sleep with you", "Exactly. Some people find it creepy and it is. Find someone  your own age unless you were widowed and you want more children, other than that stick to people pretty much as close as possible to your own age.", "What are you even talking about? The thread is a man being creepy to a woman. \n\nAnd yes, no. Means. Fucking. No. Wether you like it or not.", "Fun fact. I'm hit on quite often by gay men. I tell them thanks, but literally not my type.\n\nDo you know what 99% of gay men do when they hear that? \n\nThey give it one more shot. Something harmless like \"well, if you ever want to try something new\", or words to that effect.\n\nThen, like a normal person, I say No Thanks again. We usually laugh. And on occasion, I tell them I'll still accept that drink if that was part of the proposal. \n\nSee how grown up and well adjusted these things can be? And used to be for years and years?", "Ah, now I see why you identify with the creepy old man so much.", "It stopped being innocent when she said no and he kept pushing. He disregarded her boundaries in their first interaction. That's not innocent, it's creepy, gross and predatory", "She did handle it. You're the one being fragile here.", "She handled it. You're the one whose delicate feelings are hurt despite (presumably) not being the rejected creep.", "If you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019ve earned negative 1000+ karma in this thread it\u2019s because you\u2019re wrong", "\u201cInnocent\u201d lmfao", "No, that\u2019s how harassing someone who\u2019s shown they aren\u2019t interested in you works.", "\"well if you want to\" is a lot different than \"i don't care\"", "Keep tipping that fedora", "And no fucks were given that day.\n\nBy either side!

He should have shut up and not bothered her again.", "Why, is a lawsuit what it will take to educate you on the difference between \u201chitting on someone\u201d and harassment? \n\nBecause I think you could probably figure that out on your own with a little bit of research and soul searching.", "Expect that is not what you said initially.", "That sounds correct. Good job skippy!", "Or, keep trying as dating is a numbers game.", "I'm really happy you are so bothered by this.", "Me? I'm not the 50 yr old in question.

Don\u2019t worry about being polite to a creep.", "NTA sorry such a great experience ended on a sour note.  Men like this are quite difficult to deter so IMO rude is the way to go. If they can't take it they can just stop doing this bs.", "NTA\n\nThat's self defense not being rude", "NTA. You are there to cultivate languages of interest. He was super gross, both to fathom anyone young enough to be his daughter would welcome that kind of attention, and for bringing that into a space dedicated to an entirely different purpose.", "Well, yeah, men who chase women half their age gross me out. However, you are not a child, so he's not a predator if he asks you out. At the same time, you don't have to coddle a man's ego when he asks you out. Especially if he's being rude and presumptive about it.", "Just be careful in these situations. Women have been hurt for saying no. Not saying this guy would have hurt you but there are a lot of people who can't take rejection. NTA", "How were u being rude? Don't feel bad for being honest and straight forward.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't even call you rude. When you pointed out the age gap it clearly meant you weren't interested. He pushed back even if gently so walking away wasn't rude.", "I don\u2019t think your TA. The exchange was fairly straightforward. Don\u2019t let one horny old bloke destroy your fun. Keep going and enjoy yourself", "If her gut didn't feel right then to shut him down like she did is a thing. If he gave off \"creeper vibes\" and she felt uncomfortable that is your intuition kicking in. That is a survival thing. Get the hell out of there right quick. Hurt feelings be damned. Last year I had this guy at our city bus depot tried to lure me into his car. I was waiting on Uber to arrive. \n\n*I just got dropped off from my company's charter bus. My company paid for a charter bus to shuttle us up and down the hill to get to work for the 2nd &3rd shifts. I had just done with the 3rd shift. \n\nThis gave off some serious creeper vibes and I felt very uncomfortable so i stepped back and got my bear spray out (my boyfriend got for me when i had too wait @ night fro my work bus).  I warned him to step back mind you others were watching. I just let him have it. He learned the hard way. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. \n\nI am glad OP stood her ground and not give into the man's request. High 5to you.", "You\u2019re NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing by declining this man\u2019s advances. It\u2019s good that you stood up for yourself in this situation.\n\nAs for your friends, don\u2019t listen to them. Nothing you did is what I\u2019d consider rude, so don\u2019t worry!\n\nPS - your English is great!", "NTA. Your friends saying he\u2019s just shooting his shot must have missed when he forgot to ask nicely for your number, instead of ordering it, and then didn\u2019t take you pointing out the age difference as a big fat fucking hint. Instead saying it doesn\u2019t bother HIM. Like??? It obviously bothers you? Your response was perfect", "NTA. You basically told him no and he refused to accept that answer. He is a creep.", "NTA\n\nIt's gross and honestly insulting when someone like that tries to make moves. Just nasty.", "No, be rude. Be an asshole. That's the risk you take when you try to hit on people.", "> I was shocked as I told him I\u2019m in my 20\u2019s. I told him he\u2019s way older than me ...\n\nIt's probably better to just say \"No\".  He might ask why and you could tell him if you want to, but you don't owe him an explanation.\n\nThat said, this guy is probably a creep who goes to this language exchange group for the purpose of meeting much younger women and asking them out.  I don't think that should stop you from going, just be prepared and know what you'll say if he asks you again.\n\nNTA", "Yea it does take a lot of courage but he should\u2019ve left it as that once you said he\u2019s twice your age. At least he was upfront with his intentions and said the date part. Next time just add oh I\u2019m not available and walk away. Or even a thanks for your interest bye. Lol", "NTA. \n\nThis sounds like a socialization event, not a speed dating event. No is a complete sentence and if your red flags were going off, you were right to question it and walk away.", "NTA, when I was in my 20s (now in my 40s), I was polite to way too many guys that I wasn\u2019t interested in, who were persistent, and I felt like I had to give them a shot.  So I applaud you for setting your boundaries and staying firm.", "Wow. A man hitting on a woman above the legal age. That is not a predator. A simple no thank you, im not interested is enough. But to call him a predator? That\u2019s an AH move.", "NTA.\n\nHowever whether his behaviour is acceptable or not depends on the details.  A 45 year old is absolutely OK asking out a 29 year old.  No judgement at all.\n\nA 21 uear old is a different story", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t bother me\u201d. Mf, clearly it does bother the one who said you\u2019re too old", "NTA. You\u2019re not required to give your phone number to any random creep who asks for it.", "NTA.", "NTA.  You weren't harsh.  Don't let him ruin this resource for you.  He overstepped.  His bad.  He's a big boy and I'm sure he is used to being rejected much more harshly all the time.  If he tries to guilt you, remind him it's not a dating event, not a night club, not his hunting ground, et cetera and he ruined a pleasant interaction.  Or ignore him.  Your guy friends that said he was just shooting his shot?  Think twice about them.", "NTA I don't think you were rude at all. You stated a basic fact, that he is way older than you.  You did not owe him a conversation about it. Turning and walking away was probably the politer thing than what would have been said had you stayed lol", "Nta.  Yuck.", "NTA. I've been way ruder than this lol", "NTA. He sounds incredibly arrogant. You mentioned your age and he said it didn\u2019t bother him. The guy can\u2019t read the room. No wonder he\u2019s unattached or looking for dates.", "NTA. Not by a mile.", "NTA and look out for other signs of misogyny from your friends that thought you were too harsh. That mindset is toxic and easy to look past, because of the patriarchal world we live in.", "NTA.  Regardless of whether his intentions were good or brave or whatever, your time, attention, and energy are not a prize to be won.  He doesn't \"deserve\" your number because he tried.  The \"friends\" who are saying you're the AH aren't good friends.  Watch out.", "Yea, it doesn\u2019t bother HIM.   \ud83d\ude44", "Doesn't really sound like anyone was an asshole here, people, of any age, can express interest, and people are free to turn them down. Some may be ok with an age difference, some aren't.", "I feel like that answer was both diplomatic and relatively polite.  Idk what your friends are calling harsh.  Nta", "They do this with young women on purpose. Your friends aren\u2019t quite up to speed yet. NTA", "Because of the sub id say YTA only because you could have handled it better. He gave you an out \"it doesn't bother me\" you reply \"well...it bothers me, but thank you\"", "NTA", "NAH.\n\nHe asked you out in a social setting. You said no, and walked away. He didn't hassle you on social media, or cuss you out, or pursue you after you said no.\n\nPeople say \"NTA, you go girl!\" so quickly, but forget that \"NTA\" means that the guy is therefore an AH. I don't think that's fair in this scenario.\n\nI don't think we should be calling guys AHs for asking a woman out (providing of course both are of an appropriate age, and the setting/context is not inappropriate.)\n\nOK, yeah, he's older than you and it's a bit weird. But it's not illegal. I don't think he's an AH for trying! I think you're being a bit judgy-wudgy, if I'm honest.", "I mean, NTA really, but \"you're twice my age\" is always a terrible response.  Just say you're not interested. The response you gave is why he responded the way he did, you left him an opening. Next time, just (politely) shut it down.  If the dude continues to pester then yeah, get rude as you want.\n\nImo it is weird for a guy in his 40s to go with a woman half his age and all, but also some ppl are into that, in both age groups.", "NTA!", "NTA. you owe him nothing", "I agree with your premise, but do think the term \u201ccreep\u201d I used too liberally here. Rapists are creeps, stalkers are creeps\u2026", "Apparently women turning down creepy men is considered rude.", "Exactly. And also, as an asexual person, I hate the way any given social situation can be made uncomfortable and uninviting by men who just want to \"shoot their shot\".  She's at a language meet up. This is the first time she's met any of there people and now it will be the last because some dude couldn't realize it's not the time or place.", "Disagree, she said \u201cYou\u2019re too old for me.\u201d and he tried to argue that he didn\u2019t care, implying she wasn\u2019t allowed to care either. Ignoring a no is creep behavior.", "I agree, he asked for her number and she said no and he let it go.  I'm not sure what the controversy is lol.  It's not like she screamed at the top of her lungs and cursed him out.", "I bet he goes there to pick up dates rather than to practice language.  He knows there will be much younger women like OP there.", "> but that wasn\u2019t gonna change his mind...\n\nChances are he goes to this group in the first place for the purpose of meeting much younger women to ask out.  This is definitely a thing that some creepy older men do.", "Fortunately for OP, this guy sounds like a garden-variety creep who found a place to meet much younger women and try to pick them up.  He probably isn't dangerous, but of course OP should always be careful that he isn't following her home or some such thing.", "bro, if you are trying to date women younger than your own kid, you're basically a predator. the fact thats she's an adult just means he's not dumb enough to actually go after a minor.", "Right?

My husband and I have an age gap, he\u2019s not a predator. She could have just said no and left it at that. But she\u2019s acting like he\u2019s hitting on minors.
