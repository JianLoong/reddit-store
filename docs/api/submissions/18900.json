No need to point out the age difference; he's pretty aware of the age difference and it didn't deter him asking (demanding, almost) your phone number. No (or \"non,\" in this case) is a complete sentence.", "NTA. He asked, you said no. That should have been the end. It doesn't matter if the age difference bothers him; what matters is that it bothers YOU. If he'd simply said, \"okay, have a good night\" when his request was denied, this wouldn't be an issue at all. You don't owe anyone an explanation for not giving them your number.

That guy is a creep, I could never imagine asking someone that is around 2 times younger than me on a date. If you're friends think that he was just \"shoting his shot\" and that you were to harsh on him then I don't think those are good friends.", "okay I'm confused? where the fuck is the bit where you were rude?

So NAH.", "NTA, if he approaches you again report him to those that run the group.", "NTA.\n\nYou were brusque, but that is the risk an older man takes when he asks for a young woman's number.\n\nHe knew the risk, believe me. He won't care. To a bon vivant, getting shot down is all part of the game. They're basically annoying but dauntless.", "NTA. He's such a creep lmao. I'll say you weren't rude ENOUGH to him, should've insulted him on his face.", "NTA. He shot his shot and got shot down. You don't owe anyone politeness,  especially if they make you feel uncomfortable.", "Not the jerk. He asked for your number. You politely said no. He pushed. You walked away.

NTA. \"It doesn't bother me.\"... \"Well it DOES bother ME.\" Or you could you with what I said to people when they asked if I was my dad's date to a wedding once. (I was 19) \"Do you really think that I (gesturing to myself) would have anything to do with that?(Gesturing to my dad.)\" Dad didn't mind because a. I'm his daughter. B. I'm too young for him, you know, young enough to be his daughter. You don't owe men who dismiss your rejections politeness.", "When men have nothing else they have the audacity.", "NTA for obvious reasons.\n\nFirst off, \u201cyou SHOULD\u201d from my understanding he was demanding you give your number to him.\n\nSecondly, you hardly know him. He could be a serial killer for all you guys know. Doesn\u2019t matter if you gave him your number and you guys just talked he could still take advantage of you.", "NTA - you're not obligated to make a creep feel better.", "NTA old pervs deserve to be treated like old pervs.", "NTA, though maybe you could have just said \u201cno thank you\u201d instead of pointing out the age difference. Like obviously that\u2019s a factor, but that wasn\u2019t gonna change his mind, he\u2019d already asked you out. Just say no and walk away, he isn\u2019t owed your number.", "OP is NTA. It's okay to say no to his request.\n\nHowever, all the idiots here (who are about to downvote me) labeling this guy a creep simply for asking are the AH's.", "NAH.\n\nHe was just shooting his shot. He knew that you were younger than him, so he should be prepared for the worst. The way you handled it was a little bad, but he understands that he looks like a predator, so nobody is in the wrong here.", "NTA.\n\nYou were not interested in dating him or giving him your number and let him know, then walked away. That's not rude at all. Dating advances & pua style cold approaches come at a 50% risk of rejection and everyone who decides to gamble in a 'shoot your shot' context knows this fact. \n\nBut all the anger and disgust connected solely with his age is a bit OTT, assuming that you are an adult or older teen who could easily pass for an adult. If he gave the impression of being an entitled weirdo, pestering jerk who was very rude, tried anything criminal or made vulgar comments to you- that would be different. \n\nI'm only attracted to guys that are older than me and date with a minimum 15 year age gap.  I'm not interested in any dating/sexual involvement with guys in their 20s or teens and never have been. But I don't take it personally or get enraged when they politely approach me. Nor even worse try persuading me to change my dealbreakers for them because they are 'different from all the others'. Just make it clear that I'm not interested and walk away.", "NAH for the interaction. Are you aware of the age gap in the French President's relationship? They don't see it as anything inappropriate. He asked you out, you shot him down. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nHowever, YTA for coming here and calling him a predator for...being middle-aged? Get over yourself.", "YTA. I hate the world has become so fragile that flirting has become \"predatory\". Get over yourself, say No and get on with life. \n\nThe dude shot his shot. That's what happened all the time back before everyone needed to lighten the F up.", "Well, if he was presenting himself as he did, you could have just said \"No thank you.\" nicely.   \nStill, NAH, because you're an adult, not some child. An older guy finding you attractive isn't wrong, and you have a right to turn him down too, and you didn't call him names or anything... Right?", "Not rude. If he was really into you and had game, he would've been able to spend more time with you, the age wouldn't have mattered and you probably would've stuck around to spend time with him, but you weren't really interested, had any expectations like that and probably knew his interest anyway.\n\nSo that's all on him. You owe him nothing.\n\nI'm 34, look early mid 20, have no hang ups about age, take all the rejections in stride as it's a part of life and know everything is putting yourself out there and opening yourself up to that rejection from the start, which he didn't because his intentions caught you off guard. Maybe if he said something earlier or gave noticeable and gave you time to adjust and warm up things might have been different but in doing that it opens things up to earlier rejection and potentially being seen as creep for even trying then.\n\nHe was likely trying to gauge interest and build up something before asking but in the moment, especially when it's not at all your intention to meet someone like that, let alone an older man, that's usually the hardest part.\n\nNo harm in him trying just as much as there's no harm in you rejecting him.  So long as he respected your boundaries and you were safe, there shouldn't be much to worry about. If he's anything like me, rejection can occur on a near daily basis so he may be totally used to it.", "NTA It was creepy.", "NTA. Creepy dudes count on us being taught to be \"polite\". Pffft. You don't owe anyone your phone number. He's a predator counting on your youth.  \n\nBTW, do go back to your class. If he is there do not feel awkward. He's the one who deserves to feel uncomfortable. If he tries again, tell him \"for the second time, I am not interested in dating you. My dad is younger than you! Please stop\". Don't yell, but say it loud enough for others to hear. \nF politeness.", "NTA\n\nWell Done you! Predators use social contacts, such as manners, to guilt trip their victims into extending contact, thereby giving them more opportunities to close with their victims.", "Yta. Not for saying no, but for coming on here and your description of the situation. You\u2019re an adult calling another adult a predator. Id say you\u2019re the creep. Say no if it isn\u2019t your thing, but don\u2019t go shaming other people because of your own insecurities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
