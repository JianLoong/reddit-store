That's not rude at all. Dating advances & pua style cold approaches come at a 50% risk of rejection and everyone who decides to gamble in a 'shoot your shot' context knows this fact. \n\nBut all the anger and disgust connected solely with his age is a bit OTT, assuming that you are an adult or older teen who could easily pass for an adult. If he gave the impression of being an entitled weirdo, pestering jerk who was very rude, tried anything criminal or made vulgar comments to you- that would be different. \n\nI'm only attracted to guys that are older than me and date with a minimum 15 year age gap.  I'm not interested in any dating/sexual involvement with guys in their 20s or teens and never have been. But I don't take it personally or get enraged when they politely approach me. Nor even worse try persuading me to change my dealbreakers for them because they are 'different from all the others'. Just make it clear that I'm not interested and walk away.", "NAH for the interaction. Are you aware of the age gap in the French President's relationship? They don't see it as anything inappropriate. He asked you out, you shot him down. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nHowever, YTA for coming here and calling him a predator for...being middle-aged? Get over yourself.", "YTA. I hate the world has become so fragile that flirting has become \"predatory\". Get over yourself, say No and get on with life. \n\nThe dude shot his shot. That's what happened all the time back before everyone needed to lighten the F up.", "Well, if he was presenting himself as he did, you could have just said \"No thank you.\" nicely.   \nStill, NAH, because you're an adult, not some child. An older guy finding you attractive isn't wrong, and you have a right to turn him down too, and you didn't call him names or anything... Right?", "Not rude. If he was really into you and had game, he would've been able to spend more time with you, the age wouldn't have mattered and you probably would've stuck around to spend time with him, but you weren't really interested, had any expectations like that and probably knew his interest anyway.\n\nSo that's all on him. You owe him nothing.\n\nI'm 34, look early mid 20, have no hang ups about age, take all the rejections in stride as it's a part of life and know everything is putting yourself out there and opening yourself up to that rejection from the start, which he didn't because his intentions caught you off guard. Maybe if he said something earlier or gave noticeable and gave you time to adjust and warm up things might have been different but in doing that it opens things up to earlier rejection and potentially being seen as creep for even trying then.\n\nHe was likely trying to gauge interest and build up something before asking but in the moment, especially when it's not at all your intention to meet someone like that, let alone an older man, that's usually the hardest part.\n\nNo harm in him trying just as much as there's no harm in you rejecting him.  So long as he respected your boundaries and you were safe, there shouldn't be much to worry about. If he's anything like me, rejection can occur on a near daily basis so he may be totally used to it.", "NTA It was creepy.", "NTA. Creepy dudes count on us being taught to be \"polite\". Pffft. You don't owe anyone your phone number. He's a predator counting on your youth.  \n\nBTW, do go back to your class. If he is there do not feel awkward. He's the one who deserves to feel uncomfortable. If he tries again, tell him \"for the second time, I am not interested in dating you. My dad is younger than you! Please stop\". Don't yell, but say it loud enough for others to hear. \nF politeness.", "NTA\n\nWell Done you! Predators use social contacts, such as manners, to guilt trip their victims into extending contact, thereby giving them more opportunities to close with their victims.", "Yta. Not for saying no, but for coming on here and your description of the situation. You\u2019re an adult calling another adult a predator. Id say you\u2019re the creep. Say no if it isn\u2019t your thing, but don\u2019t go shaming other people because of your own insecurities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No trickery or deception involved.", "That's why they used the adjective \"creepy\" and not \"all\"", "Then this doesn\u2019t apply to you, does it?", "Don't be ageist you biggot.", "Where in her story do you see him insisting after she walks away (says no)? Sounds like he made his perhaps poorly chosen advance and that was that NAH", "She showed she wasn\u2019t interested, he kept trying to persuade her, thus continuing the interaction. Which should have stopped after she indicated she didn\u2019t welcome his attention.\n\nAlso, I didn\u2019t realize calling behavior \u201cinappropriate\u201d came with a time requirement. How long does a man have to engage a woman who clearly isn\u2019t interested in him and is actively trying to leave his presence before he can officially be called predatory?", "Interesting that you see a man continuing to push a woman who\u2019s shown her discomfort with the situation as a \u201cgentleman\u201d.\n\nSays a lot about you, honestly.", "Duct taped in a trunk is your threshold for \"creepy\"? Tell me you're an oven without telling me.", "No means no?\n\nI hope every gay man you meet for the next 30 years hits on you and never takes your first no. \n\nThen come back and tell me how a gay man never taking your no and giving counter points is perfectly fine and acceptable. \n\n\nI bet you'd act like they shoved a dildo in your ass or whatever.", "There *is* no counterpoint. She said no. End of story. Also his \u201ccounterpoint\u201d completely disregarded her feelings on the age matter, which gets another point in the creep column", "Uh, 1) he doesn't get a \"counter point,\" it's not a hostage negotiation. She said no thanks, she's not interested.\n\n2) \"It's not a problem for me\" isn't even a counter point, because it's a problem for her so it's irrelevant. Why would she care if some saggy-balled middle aged creep sees no problem with trying to fuck girls younger than his kids? Of course he doesn't, he's gross.", "By his 40s he should know her pointing it out was her saying it was an issue.", "6 seconds.", "Calm down, OP won't sleep with you", "Exactly. Some people find it creepy and it is. Find someone  your own age unless you were widowed and you want more children, other than that stick to people pretty much as close as possible to your own age.", "What are you even talking about? The thread is a man being creepy to a woman. \n\nAnd yes, no. Means. Fucking. No. Wether you like it or not.", "Fun fact. I'm hit on quite often by gay men. I tell them thanks, but literally not my type.\n\nDo you know what 99% of gay men do when they hear that? \n\nThey give it one more shot. Something harmless like \"well, if you ever want to try something new\", or words to that effect.\n\nThen, like a normal person, I say No Thanks again. We usually laugh. And on occasion, I tell them I'll still accept that drink if that was part of the proposal. \n\nSee how grown up and well adjusted these things can be? And used to be for years and years?", "Ah, now I see why you identify with the creepy old man so much.", "It stopped being innocent when she said no and he kept pushing. He disregarded her boundaries in their first interaction. That's not innocent, it's creepy, gross and predatory", "She did handle it. You're the one being fragile here.", "She handled it. You're the one whose delicate feelings are hurt despite (presumably) not being the rejected creep.", "If you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019ve earned negative 1000+ karma in this thread it\u2019s because you\u2019re wrong", "\u201cInnocent\u201d lmfao", "No, that\u2019s how harassing someone who\u2019s shown they aren\u2019t interested in you works.", "\"well if you want to\" is a lot different than \"i don't care\"", "Keep tipping that fedora", "And no fucks were given that day.\n\nBy either side! (Get it?)", "Cool. You should be her atty and file a big lawsuit.", "I've heard the whole gambit. Do you not know gay guys come in all flavors of attitude? \n\nHave even been called ugly after pointing out I'm straight. \n\nWhat ever their reply, I know I'm looking good that day. Tell the wife I'm \"gay guy hot\" that day.", "LoL! So calling out creepy people for creepy behavior is \u201cfedora tipping\u201d? Lol, okay.", "Gosh, how jolly hilarious; I\u2019m splitting my sides with laughter. /s", "He took a shot, she said no he said he didn't care that she said no....", "and if you miss the shot you should probably stop shooting- unless you wanna get called a creep\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No is a complete sentence. Asked and answered. He should have shut up and not bothered her again.", "Why, is a lawsuit what it will take to educate you on the difference between \u201chitting on someone\u201d and harassment? \n\nBecause I think you could probably figure that out on your own with a little bit of research and soul searching.", "Expect that is not what you said initially.", "That sounds correct. Good job skippy!", "Or, keep trying as dating is a numbers game.", "I'm really happy you are so bothered by this.", "Me? I'm not the 50 yr old in question. You gotta sue him.\n\nI thought you internet atty's knew this stuff? But def go forth with the harrassment suit. It has legs."]}
