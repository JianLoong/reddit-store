If you make the same, where has he frittered away all his money?  This is a good reason not to marry someone, because a marriage isn't just love and sex, but also a financial partnership.  (2) Tell him that you will be getting a prenup.  Those can come in two (broad) flavors: default separate or default together.  Engage an attorney to walk you through this.  (3) Prenups are more complex than you keeping the house; you will need to keep the profits and fund the maintenance in a separate account without commingled funds.\n\nBut really, I'd have saved myself a shit divorce if I'd realized that she was a spendthrift.
