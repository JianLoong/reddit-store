When I met my now fianc\u00e9, I was pretty established and had already owned my own home. My fianc\u00e9 proposed to me last year and we have been planning the wedding but also planning to move into a home that we can call ours. I initially told my fianc\u00e9 that I wasn\u2019t selling my house because I thought it would be good for a rental property. He told me he felt it would make more sense to sell my house and use that money to put toward our new home so we can get something bigger and better than what we were originally looking for. I told him I didn\u2019t want to combine that money with the new house money seeing as how I got this home on my own before even being with him and it didn\u2019t make sense to combine the two. He came back and asked if the money didn\u2019t go toward the new house, could it at least be placed in our joint bank account. I again declined that offer essentially for the same reason as before. He invested no money into the home, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask for money from it. I also want to note that my fianc\u00e9 and I make around the same yearly. He\u2019s now upset because he feels as thought I don\u2019t want to invest in our future and somehow me keeping the money from my house to myself is kind of sneaky. I assured him that I would still be paying toward our new home the same way he would, but I\u2019m just not using the funds from my old home to do it.

The fact that he wants you to put the money into a joint bank account is telling. Rethink things before you marry this guy.", "Prenup time! He has proven that he can not look at this rationally while being together.

BUT - OP, it sounds like perhaps the two of you haven\u2019t discussed marital finances thoroughly?  It just seems that the two of you may have different expectations when it comes to assets.  Perhaps it\u2019s time to have a detailed discussion.", "NTA.  That's your pre-marital property.  Keep it separate.  The fact that he's pushing so hard is a bit of a red flag.", "NTA and it's a bit of a red flag that he expects you to, essentially, kick in more to a joint house than he is prepared/willing to do.  \n\nSome couples are cool with combining assets like yours or debts like student loans.  Clearly you're not.  He is, at least when it is in his favor.  If you can't come to understand each other's perspective and agree on a path forward 1) a therapist serving as a skilled neutral third party in the room might help, 2) you might want to reconsider the marriage - not because this is a huge deal (if you both think it's a not a huge deal), but because if it remains an impasse that you can't resolve, how will you deal with much larger disagreements in the future -whether to have children, how many children, how to raise them, how to deal with your parents as they age, various tragedies and struggles that you're encounter as a couple, etc.", "NTA. Your home is an investment- YOUR investment. Unless he plans on putting in the same amount for the joint account, he can not seize upon yours like he won the lottery. \n\nI agree that you might want to seek counseling to clear up some money matters. Have you seen his account and how he spends his own money? Is he saving, investing, or spending it as fast as it comes in? These are important things to know as he would now have access to yours. \n\nYou may want to consider having 3 accounts, yours, his, and household.", "NTA for wanting to protect your premarital assets.\n\nBut it might be a good idea for y'all to get some premarital counseling to help you work through these kinds of things (and others that may not have come up yet)", "Please get a prenup. Also show your boyfriend the Mark Tilbury video about passive income. NTA", "NAH. I think it\u2019s making him insecure and it\u2019s possible he sees it as your \u201cescape route\u201d. So he worries that you don\u2019t feel confident in the relationship. Especially since It would be a premarital asset so if something were to happen you\u2019d be all set. \n\nFor your side of it, you\u2019re right. He didn\u2019t put anything into it so it is fair for you to want it to remain yours. If you decide to sell it I suggest you do so before marriage so that the moneys remain a premarital asset. I also recommend a prenup. But that\u2019s just because statistically it\u2019s a good idea to have one.", "NTA. Do agree to both having a prenup. And whatever you do, separate finances and don\u2019t put the money for the rental in a joint account. Then it will be commingled. Not saying that your marriage won\u2019t last, but if the worst case scenario, you aren\u2019t losing anything either. If he loves you he would want you to feel protected.", "NTA\n\nPlease maintain separate finances.  And get a prenup.", "NTA. I don't think you're being sneaky at all. You're being entirely upfront about the situation, and I agree that the long-term value of a rental property is almost certainly higher (barring a real estate crash that thrusts us into a *Road Warrior*-style situation) than putting the money into one new house.\n\nINFO: Why does he feel so strongly about buying a \"bigger and better\" house? And would the rental income be going into the joint account, or would that be money just for you?", "Nta. What's HE investing in your future that has monetary value and segments of his lifespan invested in? Words are free, remember.", "NTA: one word. Pre-nup", "It's posts like this that make one wonder why people get married.", "NTA, what does his credit score and debt to income ratio look like?  If you are seriously considering marrying this person, sign a prenup.  He sounds like he is after your money.", "NTA and I definitely wouldn't be still actually even dating a guy who is so obviously threatened by your individual financial security that he will do anything he can to torpedo it.", "Keep your house, you're going to need it. Make sure your name is on the deed of the new house, not just the loan. Keep your money separate from his at all times, of you lend him money make him sign a document to that effect. Actually, don't Marty this guy, he's not trying to meet your standard of living by contributing like you do, he wants you to do all the work and then lay claim to it.", "NTA. If you're able to put an equal amount of money toward a down payment and monthly payment for a shared home as he is without selling your current home, I see where you're coming from.\n\nIt sounds like you guys might need to talk more about finances and I sense a certain level of questioning or distrust on your end. Do you intend to sign a prenup? Have you talked to an attorney about what will be considered marital or community property once you get married?\n\nI ask because keeping funds separate or assets in only your name may not do much for you depending on how your state views community property. \n\nFinal thought - I'm (36 F) extremely independent including financially from my husband of one year. Kept my own last name, our current home is in my name, have separate bank accounts, etc. That said, when the time comes, I will happily use the equity from this home to enable us to purchase the type of home we want, even though that means our down payment contributions will be significantly unequal. And that's not a dealbreaker for me. I'd encourage you to really dig into whether you're certain this is your person. I'm guessing you may have some concerns.", "NTA", "NTA.   You invested in your past and he's trying to leverage that.   You said no, that should be the end of the discussion.  As others have noted, now is the time to look at a pre-nup and also consider having a real thorough discussion of finances.   Are you sure you want to combine finances with this person?", "What's even the point of getting married?! \"For richer and poorer.... except for when I don't like that idea\" are terrible vows.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
