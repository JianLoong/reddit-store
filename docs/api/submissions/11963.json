It doesn't 'quite' apply because the store is a private entity, but it does in principle. You don't have to prove your innocence. Unless they can provide a compelling reason for wanting to search your bag beyond \"it's a bag\", then tell them to pound sand.\n\nThe threat of calling the police is also a non-starter. The police is a government entity, and the 4th amendment absolutely does apply (assuming USA). They wouldn't have a legal right to search your bag, either, without probable cause, and surprise, refusing to cooperate is not probable cause.\n\nBottom line: they can ask all they want. You can refuse all you want. The burden of proof is ALWAYS on the accuser. You don't have to preemptively prove you didn't steal anything. You shouldn't make some cashier's life worse in the process.

And if you have in your bag something that could have been bought in the supermarket, you could be asked to show a proof that you bought it elsewhere and that you didn't steal it.", "NTA.

So, while cashiers can certainly ask if they can see in bags, shoppers are under no legal obligation to say yes.

OP walks up to checkout with a suitcase that is not her property.  Yes Target can demand to inspect their own property before they sell it to a customer.  People like to hide things in a suitcase and shoplift that way.\n\nThe difference here is OP is being asked to open her own backpack.

Couldn't you just leave? I mean, they are not allowed to hold you with force. That is illegal.

The thieves typically just walk out of the store. The idea of a \"smart\" thief is long gone when there is no penalty for thieving. Walmart explicitly has a no chase policy and idk who told you they have crazy security. Most retailers have mostly fake cameras around the stores. The only thieves retailers are interested in catching are the employee thieves that have access to the cash drawers and is where a majority of the cameras are in the store. That is the only shrink that cannot be written off or accounted for.", "Walmart has loss prevention officers and people standing at the doors watching for theft and receipt checking. They also have dummy AND working cameras that are monitored. Furthermore, they us AI detecting cameras at the self-checkout to detect if things aren't being scanned. That's far more than most stores. \n\nAnd no one is saying these thieve are Einsteins, but they certainly learn how to avoid detection."]}
