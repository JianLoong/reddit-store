This is where we were instructed to wear comfy clothes we can beat up in order to clean the office. We were instructed to wear jeans and a t shirt or whatever was comfortable and similar to that. No sweat pants though. \n\nThe short version is that Ash was called into our bosses office and spoken to about her outfit choice. Which was jeans and a cropped sweater. I guess they just told her that wearing a cropped sweater that went just above her navel was inappropriate work attire even in a situation like this. Boss gave her an old t shirt with the company logo to change into.  \n\nAsh spent the next 30 minutes yapping my fricking ear off about how it\u2019s unfair, sexist, and embarrassing that she was spoken to about her outfit.  She said she was wearing jeans, and wore a comfortable top that she could get dirty and that is exactly what boss said we should wear. \n\nAfter growing tired of listening to her, I told her that i don\u2019t feel bad for her and that she made a dumb decision. She accused me of being as \u201csexist\u201d as our boss. I told her she\u2019s in a corporate job, and she\u2019s not 16 so frankly she should know better and that it doesn\u2019t take a genius to know you should probably have shoulders to knees covered in a work setting. \n\nI know I didn\u2019t put it kindly, but she was also yapping for awhile and I just couldn\u2019t understand how she didn\u2019t see this coming.

At a certain point you should be able to just say, \"Shut the fuck up,\" especially when that person is 100% wrong. This isn't high school any more and she made a dumb decision. If a guy showed up wearing a crop top he would have also been given a talking-to and been provided an old t-shirt to cover up.", "NTA, I don't think it sounds sexist to expect a certain amount of clothing coverage in a corporate office. Sometimes you just have to be blunt when someone is refusing to see their error.", "NTA. the only places of business where it's okay to wear clothes with an exposed midriff are bars and places with \"uniforms\" that are designed to show it. \n\nit's common sense that it's not acceptable in an office, even on the most casual of fridays.", "NTA.

Seriously, she doesn't understand proper work attire, and then she thinks it's a good idea to audibly complain about it for the next 30 minutes. You were brusque but potentially did her a favor in getting her to drop the subject. I'm sure any boss that 'spoke' to her about her poor fashion judgement, wasn't going to look kindly on her complaining to other employees about the incident. \n\nHopefully HR can clarify the rules. Shoulders to knees is pretty conservative but if those are the rules set down by your employer, so be it. \n\nI'd resume the work friendship but not bring up the incident.

This has nothing to do with appropriate corporate attire, as you were being asked to do spring cleaning for the company and specifically told to wear something comfortable that you don't mind getting dirty. She certainly had a right to complain about being singled out and asked to changed when the instructions only said not to wear sweatpants.", "YTA \n\nIf you have a mandatory cleaning day all professionalism goes out of the window, I would never clean in \"work appropriate\" clothes. And based on your comments you are pretty yucky...", "Find something worthwhile to complain about.", "ESH \nIf I was going to be cleaning and getting sweaty I would probably tanktop and jeans with a cardigan to put on after I wiped off any excess sweat. Unless you specify what's allowed it is open to interpretation.\n\nI think she sucks for getting this angry when they handed her a substitute shirt, and instead could have pointed out in future they need to have an explicit cleaning day dress code. \n\nI think it sucks you're expected to clean a workplace at all and would likely object to that as they should pay a damned service", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just know I wouldn\u2019t wear a tank top in that situation", "Was it the best choice, no. But the company messed up and really should have been more specific (or not hand them be cleaners at all). \n\nIt was not appropriate to make her cover up like that - it really only draws more attention to it. And OP could have had some more sympathy and (in their comments) was objectifying them.\n\nNo one has still been able to tell me how this exposed stomach prevents anyone from cleaning\u2026", "\u201cIt could be distracting. She\u2019s hot.\u201d Is what you said lol.", "As far as Ive read neither Op or Ash work for anyone commenting.", ">  I just know I wouldn\u2019t wear a tank top in that situation\n\nWear whatever *you* feel comfortable with, and respect other people's choices to do the same.", "There you have it. It wasn\u2019t the best choice at all, nor shouldn\u2019t it have been. At the end of the day, most people would think not to wear crop tops as it goes far beyond appropriate for business. Mistake on her side and yes, now the office will have to be concise but they really shouldn\u2019t need to if people understand appropriate corporate work attire. Yes I did see OP\u2019s comments and was objectifying her which is shitty as hell. But the initial post of her saying it\u2019s sexist,  it was not at all", "By what he said in the post, I don\u2019t believe the company is sexist but after his comments, I do think he is and his opinion is sexist.", "Singling her out by making her visibly cover up really doesnt sit well with me. That just draws more attention to her over sight. \n\nBest thing to do would have been to let her know that in the future she should wear something more appropriate.", "Also they gave her a shirt instead of sending her home to change or not come back.", "they singled her out because she probably was the only one who wore a crop top. Actions have consequences."]}
