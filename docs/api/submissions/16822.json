No sweat pants though. \n\nThe short version is that Ash was called into our bosses office and spoken to about her outfit choice. Which was jeans and a cropped sweater. I guess they just told her that wearing a cropped sweater that went just above her navel was inappropriate work attire even in a situation like this. Boss gave her an old t shirt with the company logo to change into.  \n\nAsh spent the next 30 minutes yapping my fricking ear off about how it\u2019s unfair, sexist, and embarrassing that she was spoken to about her outfit.  She said she was wearing jeans, and wore a comfortable top that she could get dirty and that is exactly what boss said we should wear. \n\nAfter growing tired of listening to her, I told her that i don\u2019t feel bad for her and that she made a dumb decision.

Seriously, she doesn't understand proper work attire, and then she thinks it's a good idea to audibly complain about it for the next 30 minutes.
