Last night, my BIL texted my husband inviting us to Thanksgiving at their house \u2014 with all extended family confirmed as yes. I sent a group text this morning thanking them for the invite, stating confusion about their hosting without circling back to us, and letting them know that, unfortunately, we won\u2019t be able to make it. Her response was that she remembers the conversation but didn\u2019t get a formal invite and wanted to cook her first turkey this year and hopes we come because family. I responded that if family, specifically our family, was a priority, then she would have reached out to us to talk about hosting. Instead of inviting everyone else in the beginning of October and us yesterday. She shut me down hard saying I clearly wanted to fight and to have a nice day. My husband and I said ok. Two hours later she texts us that my husband can no longer be our nieces godmother. I went off. AITA?

We have hosted holidays and holiday parties since my husband and I were dating over a decade ago. They have never offered to host previously. They recently bought a new house (last May) and my SIL\u2019s texts focused around the opportunity to host in their new home and we should understand. We live over an hour away from each other, and one of my children has anaphylactic food allergies, which she is quite lax about, and we have had to stop him from eating foods in her home that she has assured us is fine. He is also allergic to pets, which they have. My main issue is that she asked me the plan, did not indicate in any way that she wanted to host, and then went behind our backs to invite others before telling us. Like no mentioning that she wanted to host this year, so could we figure something out? And, my calling her out on that led to \u201churt feelings\u201d and \u201cus being disrespectful\u201d and unfit to be godparents. Like, what? After the godparent comment, I did let out some massive frustrations, but somehow she thinks that because I asked what happened with us hosting and didn\u2019t immediately say yes we would come, that justifies us being unfit to raise her child. And further suggested that she couldn\u2019t trust us. But, we are insulting? I can\u2019t even. But, maybe I\u2019m the asshole. So give it to me straight."]}
