I (25M) left home when I was 17 because my step-father made my teenage life a living hell. Little bit of a backstory, my mom had me when she was 19 and was a single mother until I was 12. We moved from place to place for many years until she met her husband. At first, me and him got along fine. While we had different interests, we were civil with each other at the time. He pulled me aside a year after they met and after we fully moved into his condo and asked me what I would think if he proposed to my mom. At the time, I was excited! Not only would my mom have a husband, but I would finally have the father figure I was desperate for! It was after their wedding when things took a turn. \n\nI\u2019m not going to say everything he did to me (I don\u2019t have enough characters for that) but here are some of the highlights:\n\n1. Took my bedroom door off of its hinges when I asked for more privacy\n\n2. Picked the lock on the bathroom door when I\u2019m answering natures call just to yell at me that I forgot to turn off my bedroom light that morning before leaving for school\n\n3. Threatened to game over himself when mom and I yelled back at him (he was screaming in my face for burning the dinner I was cooking that night)\n\n4. Said to my face \u201cyou have no idea how much I want to wring your neck right now\u201d because I didn\u2019t want to go to archery practice that day because I had a date\n\n5. Took away my Christmas presents on Christmas Day when I was 14 because I slept in\n\nThere are many others but not enough spaces. When I was 15, mom got pregnant and my little sister was born 9 months later. I adore her to this day. She\u2019s 9 now. Here is where I might be TA. One day in summer when I was 17, my step-dad and I got into a REALLY heated argument. I don\u2019t remember what about. I begged mom to call my grandparents to come pick me up. They did with my uncle hidden in another driveway to make sure my step-dad didn\u2019t follow us. Mom and I still kept in contact (we never talked about step-dad when her and I talked) but I went no contact with him. 8 years later we\u2019re at the current day and mom comes to visit for a month with my little sister. A day before they made their trip back, my little sister was crying saying she didn\u2019t want to leave because \u201cdaddy will just yell and scream again.\u201d That was a HUGE red flag for me so I asked mom to tell me the truth as to what\u2019s going on at home. She broke down and says he\u2019s been treating her worse and worse ever since I left and that she\u2019s planning an exit and divorce. 2 weeks later they\u2019re back with all of their stuff in tow. My step-dad\u2019s side of the family have been barraging me with messages saying it\u2019s all my fault and I broke up a family that didn\u2019t deserve to be.

You left because of HIS behavior, and he is the only one that to blame for that. Frankly your mother should be ashamed of allowing him to treat you that way. \n\nI see this as a point of celebration- your mom finally figured out that he\u2019s a nightmare and that no kid deserves to be yelled at for burning dinner or have their Christmas gifts take a way. Yes, this will be hard on your sister because she\u2019s young, and hopefully there will be therapy for all of you.

Even if you didn't ran away at 17, it was just going keep getting worse for you and probably you were just going to delay the inevitable. I am glad your mom and sister also ran away.", "Holy shit, NTA. Not only are you not TA, you're a crucial pillar of support for your mother. \n\nI hope you *do* cause their divorce. It would be the best thing you could do.", "NTA. Come on. Step dad is more that just an asshole. He\u2019s a psycho.  You saved your mother and sister.", "NTA. You did what you needed to do for your own safety and sanity. Not only that, because you left, your mother and sister have been able to follow that same path and find a way out.", "NTA; obviously not your fault and also, this sounds like a good move for literally everyone in the situation that you care about. Literally nothing to be guilty about", "This has nothing to do with you. You did nothing wrong. Your step-dad has some serious issues that possibly counseling could not change.\n\nDon't concern yourself with all the haters. Block them. Stay safe.", "NTA Abuse is the abuser\u2019s fault only and this guy was an abuser from the start. He abused you first and I guarantee he noted that your mom wasn\u2019t able to really stand up for you. It\u2019s not surprising that once his primary target left he switched to her as he already knew she wasn\u2019t likely to push back. It probably would have happened in time even if you stayed. Even if you were the catalyst for your mom\u2019s decision- How is it bad to break up a family where a young child is scared to go home and the father is not capable of treating his spouse with respect and decency?", "NTA!!! but it bothers me that your mom let this go on for years, but didn\u2019t seem to care until he directed his anger at her. Obviously, he\u2019s the biggest AH here, but your mom needs to apologize to you.", "NTA at all.  Your step-dad's behavior is the reason people don't want to be around him, and only he has control over that.  Sounds like your Mom gave him plenty of time to change his ways and he didn't.  Plus your Mom has to protect your little sister (you too when you were young).  No surprise his family thinks he is not at fault because they never taught him not to be an asshole.   Good for you for getting away on your own.", "NTA - Your stepfather is an abusive asshole. This is not your fault in anyway shape or form.", "NTA. It's not your fault it came to this. It would have been better if the relationship ended sooner, but that's not important right now. It's great that your mother understands now that this person is abusive and dangerous. Don't listen to people who say YTA, that's simply not the truth. Stay stafe.", "NTA !", "NTA and they are not divorcing because of you.  They are divorcing because your mother can no longer stand to live with an abusive AH and that AH is terrorizing your little sister just like he terrorized you.

It always astonishes me when all these outside people send messages that blame someone else when they are not involved in the whole thing.", "NTA: you saved your mom and sister from torment and abuse. It\u2019s the sole actions of your stepdad that contributed to their divorce. Never feel guilty of doing what was necessary to protect you and your love ones.", "Nta. It kept getting worse and worse after you left because his regular punching bag was gone. Your mom was using you at the time so it wasn't directed at her. You were the shield, when you left, she had to face it. Only then did her eyes actually open. Did she ever apologize for letting that happen to you?", "NTA\n\nDon't you see that has nothing to do with you? He was an asshole when you were here. He was an asshole when you weren't. He's an asshole. Full stop.", "Of course NTA. How are you responsible for his abuse? He treated his family like shit so they left him, end of story.

If  a 16 year old can break up your 3rd marriage, I think the universe is telling you that you are not \u201cwife\u201d material.    \n\n\nShe also tried to give me marriage advice one time.

It sounds like you helped your mom find the confidence to leave an abusive situation. You gave your mother and sister a lifeline.\n\nEverything you describe is your stepfather\u2019s fault. He is the abuser. You, your mom and your sister are the victims and I hope your mom is able to follow through with the divorce. \n\nBlock his family.", "No. That divorce isn\u2019t about you. Just like the marriage wasn\u2019t. NOTHING is your fault. Your mom\u2019s a big girl. She can make her own decisions. Block those asses in your step father\u2019s family. Good luck. (Mom might want a restraining order.) You\u2019re the opposite of the AH.", "nta - his awful behavior is not a result of you saving yourself from a toxic environment. he's the only one at fault, not you.", "NTA The thing about abusers is that they don't become less abusive, they just change their target when one leaves. He likely didn't even get worse, it just redirected to your mother when you left and made things more inconvenient to ignore.", "NTA - you left home years before your mother finally came to her senses.  Your stepfather is abusive, you, your mother and your sister are the victims.  Your stepfather is just trying make himself look better than he is and trying to find someone other than him to blame for his failures.", "NTA you are a victim. He is abusive it\u2019s only his fault.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s normal to feel guilt but this is a grown up problem and you were just a kid. \n\nThere is not even one tiny piece of this story that was your fault. \n\nHis behavior was escalating from the moment he married your mom and just continued. Your leaving was not a catalyst for his behavior or the demise of the relationship. Even if your mom perceives it that way, it\u2019s simply not true. \n\nBe prepared to testify in court if he fights your mom over custody of your sweet little sister. You could be her hero.", "NTA\n\nYour stepdad was a manipulative abusive AH. There was no marriage to break", "YTA. You fled for your safety, but then left your sister and mom to fend for themselves? You could've done more to ensure they were okay in the years you were gone. Instead, you chose to avoid confrontation with your step-dad, and look where it led.

That isn't on you in the slightest, don't ever let anyone tell you that you had to stay to keep others happy, because that's a hella toxic way of thinking, but it is probably the \"mechanics\" of the situation as it were.

I don't know if your conversation encouraged your mother to leave him, or if she would have anyway, but if you did play a part in it then you helped her and your sister to get out of a terrible home situation. You should feel proud rather than guilty if that's the case.", "NTA. What it sounds like to me is that you were the focus of his anger and abuse while you lived there and when you left, the anger he needed an outlet. So he aimed it at somebody else. The somebody else was your mother and your sibling.\n\nQuite frankly, the fact that your mother allowed him to be as abusive to you, as he was does not reflect well on her.", "NTA\n\nBlast them back. Tell them the abuser is the one who caused the divorce. Then block them.", "NTA. Regardless of where you live or what you said to whom or when, the relationship between your mom and your step dad is between them. You did not break them up regardless of what he thinks or tells his family. His behaviour toward you may have been part of the reason for the breakup, but that\u2019s on him and not you. Your mother is an adult and makes her own choices.", "It's 100% not your fault.\n\nBut... I'd take credit for it. He's a monster.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "Good for you for modeling to your mom how you leave abuse, and giving your sister a chance at a peaceful home. His abuse caused the divorce. You should be proud if you gave her the courage to leave.", "NTA. There is no possible interpretation in which you are the asshole. However, you are badass and your mom and sister are lucky to have you.", "NTA.  He had problems before you even existed", "100% NTA\n\nI'm so glad you all got out.", "NTA You left to protect yourself because you were his target. After you left he targeted your mom and sister. That isn't your fault it is his. They are gaslighting you into thinking it is your fault instead of actually blaming him for being abusive. NEVER doubt the choices you made. If it was a bad choice the other adults in your life wouldn't have helped you escape but they did because they could see the problem.\n\nIt took your mom this long to give up on him and that is not on you.", "NTA. You didn't cause the divorce. You got the ball rolling to your mom finally deciding to leave and to protect your sister. It's too bad she waited so long.blike thank goodness she had your actions to role model for her because your mom might have stayed even longer. And that would have hurt your sister and her even more.", "NTA.  You did what you had to do which was to protect yourself.  Once you left your mom became his new target.  You didn\u2019t do anything, and your mom should have protected you all those years ago.  Your stepdad family should put the blame where it belongs, on the abuser not the abused.", "NTA\n\nYou, your mom and your sister are the victims here. He is an abusive bast***\n\nIf any, you are the hero that helped your mother to make the choice to leave that guy.\n\nOf course his family will defend him. But listen, no pity to abusive basta***", "You left because he abused you. Mom and stepsis left because he abused them.\n\nNTA You didn't cause anything, he did. If he'd been a great father and spouse he'd still have a wife and kids.", "NTA, if it is because of you it\u2019s not your \u2018fault\u2019 it\u2019s your \u2018triumph\u2019 - you helped your mom and sister escape their (and your) abuser. Well done.\n\nAs for the idiots harassing you, well I guess you know where he gets his victim complex and lack of accountability from. Just remind them that stalking is illegal and stalking a minor is serious and then block them everywhere", ">If they divorced because of me wouldn\u2019t it be my fault after all\n\nI would wear that with pride. I'd tell everyone I saved my little sister from living with an abuser. Tell people it is your fault. Own it. Be proud.\n\nWould you want your little sister growing up thinking this is how men treat women? Would you want her getting in a relationship like that someday because that's what she thinks is normal?", "NTA, but your stepdad is and so is his family. It is NOT, I repeat, NOT your fault. The next time your stepdad's family tries to hassle you, just state (and I know it's not easy) your mom and sister left because of HIS behavior. Then block them.", "Fuck no. No you're NTA be any metric here. You were a child in an abusive environment. Not your fault. I'm glad you're out and I'm glad your sister and mother are too. I hope things get better for them and I salute you for having the strength to leave when you did.", "The fact that your stepdad NEEDS to abuse someone and his family blames you for it not being YOU doesn\u2019t make it your fault. There\u2019s something wrong and broken within him and he would have done it to someone if you had never met him. This isn\u2019t on you. \nAny other child he would have done the same to. You couldn\u2019t stop him and you couldn\u2019t cause him. He is who he is. \nI\u2019m sorry your mom didn\u2019t have the strength to leave for you. You deserve to know that she should have, you didn\u2019t deserve what happened.", "Facts", "This should be pinned as the top comment.  \n\nYou saved your Mom and sister \ud83d\udcaf", "Facts", "IS.  The stepfather IS one.\n\nLet's not leave out the family that created and nurtured the stepfather into being abusive. The audacity they have to blame OP for causing this divorce is astounding, as well.\n\n/u/ThrowawayMyDadIsBad should celebrate the fact that his mom and sister are saved and entering a brighter chapter of their lives.", "Mom has apologized. That was the first thing she did when I greeted her at my place.", "Mom has apologized yes. That was the first thing she did when I greeted her at my place after she moved out.", "LOL this gave me a good laugh. I could never be that petty personally. Thank you for making me laugh. Cheered me up a bit", "What a terrible, victim-blaming response this is. You should be ashamed.", "Brain dead take", "Uhhhhh. Worst take award", "Because a 17 year old child is responsible for \u201csaving\u201d their parent and sibling?! That\u2019s not sensible at all to suggest", "It is not the job of an abused minor to rescue his mother, who is a grown woman who should be protecting him, or his little sister, who he has no legal authority to take with him.", "OP was an abused 17 year old. His mother was the adult who should have protected her children and herself, and she failed miserably. Your opinion is one of the most disgusting and ridiculous things I've ever read on this site. Exactly what was a teenager supposed to do to save his mom?", "I'm glad! It shows that she didn't realize what she was doing with her actions or lack there of. But again, nta", "I tell people objectively. Not what they want to hear or makes them feel good. Facts over feelings.", "None of what you said was fact. It was all interpretation, and your interpretation was cruel.", "Factually, a 17 year old is not qualified to protect *two people* from an abuser.", "Factually you\u2019re an ass."]}
