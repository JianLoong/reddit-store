It wasn't a big party or anything, just some people over at his house to BBQ, play yard games, and hang out.  There wasn't really a set start-time, he just told people to come over after lunch and they plan to have food ready at 5pm.  My brother lives about a 30-minute drive from us.\n\nI told my GF on last Thursday that I would like to leave our place by 1pm so that we could hang out and socialize for a while before eating.  She agreed that was a good time to leave.  I had some errands to run Saturday morning, so I got those done and got home around 11am.  I ate a quick lunch and got myself ready by noon.  My GF had gone to the gym while I was gone and was slowly getting herself ready to go but hadn't showered by the time I was ready.\n\nWhen I finished getting myself ready, I asked her if she was still going to be ready at 1pm.  She said yes, but also said \"There's no rush, they'll be there all day.\"  I told her that while that's true, I would like to get there sooner than later and see people and hang out.  I left to take our dog for a quick walk before we left and told my GF to finish getting ready by the time I get back.  \n\nI got back just before 1pm and she was still picking out an outfit and hadn't done her make-up.  I told her to please hurry because I would like to get going.  Thirty minutes later and I find her on her phone placing a door dash order because she \"hadn't eaten anything for lunch yet.\"  I told her if she's that hungry, we can grab something on the way or there will be food at my brother's house.  She said she wanted an iced coffee too and I reminded her that there is a Starbucks 1/2 mile from our house. \n\nI told her to cancel the order and finish getting ready so we can go.  She said she'll finish getting ready while her order is being delivered.  I told her I'm leaving in 15-minutes with or without her and she just said \"Ok.\"   Twenty minutes later, her food still wasn't delivered so I told her I was leaving.  I guess she thought I was bluffing because she made no attempt to leave with me.  By this time it was past 1:30pm.\n\nShe called me 15-minutes later because she had apparently gone to finish her makeup and yelled for me to get the door when her food was delivered.  She didn't even realize I had left without her.  She told me to turn around and come get her.  I told her no, because I had already been waiting for her and given her numerous chances to leave at our agreed upon time.  \n\nI told her to take an Uber or something and meet me there (she doesn't have a car).  She refused and said unless I come get her, then she isn't coming.  I told her I would see her later that night then.  When I got home, she was pissed.  She said she spent all that time getting ready to look nice for me and my family, only for me to leave her at home like the dog.

If the party is going on all afternoon and into the evening, your girlfriend probably interpreted you saying 1 pm as 'around when I want to leave' whereas you meant it as a hard deadline. 1:30 is not egregiously late to be ready in this context, and taking off without her seems like a bit of an overreaction. This just seems like bad communication, unless she's routinely late for things and inconsiderate like this.", "ESH - I mean the party was for about 5, you wanted to go at 1, she would have been ready about 1:40, in that context 40 minutes isn't that bad.", "INFO: was this the first time she pulled this out. \nIf yes YTA\nIf no NTA", "Esh.

If so, his reaction makes more sense, and it was definitely an AH move for her to order food when they're trying to leave.
