It wasn't a big party or anything, just some people over at his house to BBQ, play yard games, and hang out.  There wasn't really a set start-time, he just told people to come over after lunch and they plan to have food ready at 5pm.  My brother lives about a 30-minute drive from us.\n\nI told my GF on last Thursday that I would like to leave our place by 1pm so that we could hang out and socialize for a while before eating.  She agreed that was a good time to leave.  I had some errands to run Saturday morning, so I got those done and got home around 11am.  I ate a quick lunch and got myself ready by noon.  My GF had gone to the gym while I was gone and was slowly getting herself ready to go but hadn't showered by the time I was ready.\n\nWhen I finished getting myself ready, I asked her if she was still going to be ready at 1pm.  She said yes, but also said \"There's no rush, they'll be there all day.\"  I told her that while that's true, I would like to get there sooner than later and see people and hang out.  I left to take our dog for a quick walk before we left and told my GF to finish getting ready by the time I get back.  \n\nI got back just before 1pm and she was still picking out an outfit and hadn't done her make-up.  I told her to please hurry because I would like to get going.  Thirty minutes later and I find her on her phone placing a door dash order because she \"hadn't eaten anything for lunch yet.\"  I told her if she's that hungry, we can grab something on the way or there will be food at my brother's house.  She said she wanted an iced coffee too and I reminded her that there is a Starbucks 1/2 mile from our house. \n\nI told her to cancel the order and finish getting ready so we can go.  She said she'll finish getting ready while her order is being delivered.  I told her I'm leaving in 15-minutes with or without her and she just said \"Ok.\"   Twenty minutes later, her food still wasn't delivered so I told her I was leaving.  I guess she thought I was bluffing because she made no attempt to leave with me.  By this time it was past 1:30pm.\n\nShe called me 15-minutes later because she had apparently gone to finish her makeup and yelled for me to get the door when her food was delivered.  She didn't even realize I had left without her.  She told me to turn around and come get her.  I told her no, because I had already been waiting for her and given her numerous chances to leave at our agreed upon time.  \n\nI told her to take an Uber or something and meet me there (she doesn't have a car).  She refused and said unless I come get her, then she isn't coming.  I told her I would see her later that night then.  When I got home, she was pissed.  She said she spent all that time getting ready to look nice for me and my family, only for me to leave her at home like the dog.

People who don't give a damn about other people's time are generally assholes. The nerve of her to get upset after she took so long getting ready and ORDERED FOOD before going to a BBQ. It sounds like she wanted to sabotage your day.", "NTA. \n\nDoes she do this often? If it was just this one time, I'd question if she didn't want to go for some underlying reason and try to talk through that with her. \n\nIf she does this often, Dude, you are with a dick of a human being, because that is some controlling BS right there. I'd have done the exact same thing.", "NTA= ugh, my word, your gf seems like a lot of work. This seems like a power play on her part, and good for you to not put up with it. I don't know how long ya'll have been together, but unless this type of behavior is an isolated incident, it would make me rethink the whole relationship.", "No, she took her sweet ass time when she agreed to leave at 1.\n\nThis person doesn't care about you getting time with family.  You were right to leave her at home.  She'll know better for next time.  NTA", "NTA, Does she make everyone wait for her often?", "NTA. But you need to have a real discussion about your respective behaviour. She could have been ready but chose not to be. My guess is she didn\u2019t really want to spend that many many hours with your family.  But she should have talked to you about it.", "NTA - fair notice given, expectations communicated.  She doesn\u2019t value your time. Hopefully it\u2019s a wake up call for her and things will be better next time. Should\u2019ve brought the dog with you instead.", "NTA, I\u2019m assuming you absolutely would\u2019ve let her get food from a drive thru on the way ?

Mine would be at the car ready to go before i am. She's just inconsiderate", "NTA.  You communicated with her multiple times that you wanted to leave at a certain time and she deliberately stalled getting ready.  My guess is that was trying to show you who was boss.  It appears that she succeeded, just not in the way she hoped.  At least she was able to look nice for the dog.", "Nta\n\nWhat she did was incredibly rude. She showed that she only thinks about herself... sure that's someone you want to be with?", "WTF? did she expect you to wait around all day for her?  She has 0 respect for you or your time.  Good for you that you left her there.  She was purposefully taking her time.  The question is why?  You've done nothing wrong.

Maybe she will learn to respect you next time", "NTA.\n\nBut also it should be noted... This falls under the \"You can be right or you can be happy\" clause.\n\nLike I agree with you and your frustration, but was it worth it?\n\nPersonally speaking this isn't a fight I would've stood firm on unless it's a habitual thing because it wouldn't have been a big deal to be an hour early instead of 2-3 hours early.\n\nBut that's just like... my opinion man.", "NTA- She took too long and you warned her.", "NTA - The thing that sealed my rating is that she ordered food 1/2 an hour after the time you said you wanted to leave.  Patience with someone who doesn't have good time management is fine and people who are chronic clock watchers (like me) can be AHs over just a few minutes, but 30 minutes late and then ordering food shows what she really though of your deadline.", "INFO: Are you sure she was okay with just hanging out for that long? Was this just a unilateral decision? Is she often late like this?\n\nTo me, this reads like your girlfriend really didn't want to be at your brother's house to hang out for 4 hours before the food was ready and then who knows how long after.", "Wow. Is this a recurring issue about time with you guys. Arriving three plus hours early for a party seems a bit extreme. But you told her your plans and she putzed around. ESH. You two don't seem to listen to each other.", "NTA- You gave her plenty of warning and told her before hand what time you wanted to leave. It doesn't matter if they're going to be there all day, you told her one day prior what time you wanted to leave. Her dragging out things was infuriating to read.", "NTA I\u2019m wondering if there was Any way your gf could have been more unsupportive, selfish, disrespectful and just plain rude\u2026 and I\u2019m drawing a blank. \n\nThis one is Not a keeper.", "I'm going to get downvoted for sure, but I say ESH (though she sucks more). If the party is going on all afternoon and into the evening, your girlfriend probably interpreted you saying 1 pm as 'around when I want to leave' whereas you meant it as a hard deadline. 1:30 is not egregiously late to be ready in this context, and taking off without her seems like a bit of an overreaction. This just seems like bad communication, unless she's routinely late for things and inconsiderate like this.", "ESH - I mean the party was for about 5, you wanted to go at 1, she would have been ready about 1:40, in that context 40 minutes isn't that bad.", "INFO: was this the first time she pulled this out. \nIf yes YTA\nIf no NTA", "Esh. You did tell her and she did agree. But you should have stopped and spoken to her directly and not through threats. \n\nAlso she\u2019s your gf, come on man. Don\u2019t be that guy, it\u2019s embarrassing.", "NAH - your gf views relationships as a competition and she decided to make you wait for her to reinforce how unimportant your wants are to her.  This is the same thing as that one family member that is always hours late to every family gathering because they \"had something important to do that took longer than they expected\"\n\nRead up on narcissism and see if she checks more boxes.", "I feel like there was another similar reddit story where the gf was always making the OP late and the overwhelming advice was to say when you\u2019re leaving and then do it. It\u2019s the same in this case. \nThis wasn\u2019t a case of the gf running late bc of unforeseen circumstances. She consistently chose to disregard the agreed upon timeline. Consequences.\nNTA", "Seriously, same here. I\u2019m disabled and it takes me some extra time to get ready, so I start early.", "Yeah, no nookie for a month for this stunt.", "Lol...what a bullshit cop out phrase.  You can be right or be happy. \n\nYou mean not having your needs met in a relationship or just roll over to make your partner happy?\n\nIf someone is at the point you need to say that, then just let the person go!", "Why would info be needed? If your theory is correct instead of communicating that she didn't want to be there that early or long she makes excuses and stalls frustrating both of them. Either way OP would not be the a*hole. That would be lack of communication on her part.", "In the post, it says  'she agreed that would be a good time to leave'. So if she really didn't want to hang there that long, she should've said it then, not agreed, then stall and stall and stall while never saying she had an issue. \n\nI think it's more likely she's just a person who runs late.", "He repeatedly said he wanted to leave at 1. This comment is nonsense\n\nI'll also add she wasn't ready at half 1. She noticed at 1.45 or so when the food turned up and she was still getting ready. He left at past half 1", "She wasn't ready at 1.40. He said it was past half 1 when he left and she rang 15 minutes later at the moment her food turned up while she was still getting ready", "> Read up on narcissism and see if she checks more boxes.\n\nLol. Classic reddit psychologists", "I'm not saying I agree with that outcome but it is a highly likely reality lol.\n\nRelationships are give and take, picking your battles counts for a lot.\n\nI still maintain my opinion shifts somewhat if this is a regular thing but I'd still recommend some real discussion or perhaps even counseling instead to avoid the risk of a negative feedback loop.", "Yeah I don't really get these posts, guy pisses off his girlfriend and then gets the whole Internet to rip into her... does he ever want to have sex with her ever again?", "I'm not entirely sure why you are ignoring all of the context I provided but I'll be generous and explain.\n\n>You mean not having your needs met in a relationship or just roll over to make your partner happy?\n\nNo. As I explained, unless this was a pattern of behavior it's not worth making a big deal and getting in a fight over it.\n\n>If someone is at the point you need to say that, then just let the person go!\n\nIf you think it's reasonable to let someone go because you were less early to a party with no firm start time than you'd've liked... Then I agree. You should let the other person go.", "Because depending on that answer, it could either be NTA or ESH. OP would in fact be an AH for making that sort of unilateral decision and just assuming his gf was okay with it", "What an interesting and unnecessary defensive response.", "Is it a unilateral decision if GF chose to not communicate but rather use tactics? No.", "Lol. Classic reddit psychologists", "> your gf views relationships as a competition and she decided to make you wait for her to reinforce how unimportant your wants are to her\n\nThis just reeks of Reddit psychologist syndrome. At no point does he insinuate that from her behavior, you are just taking a giant leap and assuming the worst with no evidence to support that claim", "Hence ESH", "What an interesting and unnecessary defensive response.", "She ordered the food at 1pm, that's all the evidence I need to know what she's doing. So either you do the same thing to the people in your life or your reading comprehension skills suck.", "Well you know how us narcissists who need to go NC with our family can be.", "> She ordered the food at 1pm, that's all the evidence I need to know what she's doing.\n\nOK? Explain the leap from ordering food at 1pm to narcissism. That's a massive, gargantuan leap.", "Oh, I see your reading comprehension skills are lacking.  I didn't say she's a narcissist, I just simply suggested OP read up on narcissism.\n\nWhat's very interesting is your desire to undermine my recommendation and try to prevent OP from learning about narcissism, who are you trying to protect?", "Don't worry, I'm learning plenty about narcissism by watching you try to convince people that you're a psychologist.", "Right. You didn't say she's a narcissist, you merely implied it. Huge difference difference there Tucker Carlson. \n\n> What's very interesting is your desire to undermine my recommendation and try to prevent OP from learning about narcissism, who are you trying to protect?\n\nPlease diagnose me in this thread reddit doctor", "What an interesting way to say, \"Thanks for supporting me with the issue I'm having in my original post.\"", "What an interesting way to say, \"Oh my bad, I got that wrong.
