If we are sharing a full or twin, it would have to be an emergency. \"I don't want your dad in my special room so I will not spend 3 days in a bed I already occasionally share with you\" does not sound like an emergency. \n\nPeople are saying OP refusing rent is a \"gotcha\" for him being the AH but perhaps he liked that she was using her money to help her family and thought they shared a value there. But, when it was his dad that needed something she was uncompromising.", "\u201c After all, she doesn't pay rent, and this is my apartment\u201d", "On it\u2019s face, it does sound weird.  But I think it\u2019s weird that she has her own room and doesn\u2019t contribute financially.  To each their own but that set up wouldn\u2019t work for me or, I bet, virtually any  woman or man that was footing the bill in this circumstance.", "The visit parents should stay in the guest room, which the girlfriend's been using for a long time. Doesn't make it forever hers.", "There isn\u2019t though. Not legally speaking in terms of occupancy. If she has lived there for more than a few weeks/ month, it is her apartment.", "You mean the leap from OP saying it is his apartment to him thinking it is his apartment? Lol", "He TOLD her not to pay rent which means she has probably offered more than once and been told \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it I got it covered\u201d (basically an earlier comment OP made) it\u2019s his guest, he wants the guest to have a bed he gets to sleep with GF or on the couch because HE is the host and it\u2019s \u201cno big deal\u201d to him so PERFECT HE CAN SLEEP ELSEWHERE", "This is just echoing OP\u2019s \u201cholier than thou\u201d mindset here which is unwarranted. She didn\u2019t ask for this so called \u201csacrifice\u201d.", "She offered to pay rent, but OP told her no.\n\nIf he doesn't want her to pay, then he also doesn't get to use it as leverage to get his way, because that's such a shitty thing to do.\n\nEdit: he's deleted a bunch of his comments.", "Ah yes, the \u201ctechnically it\u2019s the same\u201d. No one is talking about the \u201ctechnically\u201d here", ">The GF said she didn\u2019t mind OP sleeping with her in her bed, so clearly she doesn\u2019t have an issue sleeping with him. Which means she only has an issue sleeping with him in his bed.\n\nOr, she has an issue with a stranger being in her room with her things. Like, maybe she has diaries she doesn't want read. It's not unheard of for men to get weird with women's underwear, which she would be leaving in the room.  There are a lot of reasons one can think of for not wanting someone in your private space and we don't know her reason. I only brought up a few that could be the reason.\n\nThey all should have planned better. Maybe they could've moved OPs bigger bed into her room for them to sleep in together and given his father her smaller bed but in OPs room. Or they could've bought a twin bed to put in the living room for less than the cost of a hotel so everyone could have a bed. Lots could've been done if they had just considered that a 70 year old man needed a bed before inviting him over.", "I'm saying that because one particular piece of information doesn't add up. \n\nBut yeah I absolutely admit this is part projection on my life. As are most options on this sub. I've been creeped on so I'm gonna be extra cautious about it and look for it everywhere.", "She invited OP into her bed, so cosleeping isn\u2019t the issue here. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s just uncomfortable with the idea of a man she doesn\u2019t know well sleeping in her bed, if I had to guess?", "When you agree to live with someone who pays all the bills, even a really slow person should be able to understand they won't be getting to equal control the home. The apartment literally belongs to someone else. They get to decide what to do with the space. An occasional fuck does not change that simple fact.", "In my house we pay mortgage equally. If my 70 y/o father came to stay and I asked my spouse to sleep IN BED WITH ME so my father could sleep in the spare room, I\u2019d say \u201cI pay for this house TOO.\u201d \nHere\u2019s the rub\u2026 my spouse would NEVER argue with it and would offer to sleep on the couch themselves if needed. GF is TA 100%", "Yeah, sorry but I wouldn't give my bed to my elderly family members if they wanted to stay with me. If they're too old for the pull-out or an air mattress, they can get a hotel or I'll go take a hotel or crash somewhere and visit them instead. The idea of someone besides my partner in my bed squicks me out too much!", "Alright, sorry.\nIt works differently in my country though; only 2 things matter - how many rooms there are and whether the kitchen is separate or a part of one of the rooms. \nFor instance, our flat was \u201c3+1\u201d - it means there were 3 rooms (no matter if it was a bedroom or a living room) and a separate kitchen. \n2+1 means two rooms and a separate kitchen.\n3+kk means three rooms and the kitchen is a part of one of the rooms. \nSo when buying/renting a place, all we care about is how many rooms there are, we don\u2019t really care about their purpose.", "This was my thought. It\u2019s your dad, you take the couch and let him have your room if you can\u2019t sleep with your gf. I\u2019d think it weird you\u2019d rather have your dad in your girlfriend\u2019s room anyway rather than yours.\n\nIf you invite the guest, you should be the one you inconvenience, not anyone else. If she invited her mom and asked you to move to her room so her mom could have your room, I\u2019d say the same thing (that in that case she should give up her room and not make you give up yours.)", "It doesn't say she pays for nothing, she just doesn't pay rent. One doesn't need to be in years long cohabitation to qualify for being the same as a \"married\" couple. They live together, they are in a relationship. That is that. She offered to pay rent. He turned it down. He now uses that to hold over her head when she doesn't want a strange old man sleeping in her bed. He very likely uses this quite often to get his way.", "YTA for withholding information and deleting downvoted comments. Also YTA for holding paying the rent over your gfs head and using it as a bargaining chip even tho she offered to contribute. Your dad is the one visiting, you should be the one making concessions to accommodate him. Give him the big bed and sleep on the couch for a couple nights, its not a big deal.", "Let me get this straight, you want your dad to stay in her room, and she can stay in yours? By your logic, can\u2019t you suck it up while he is there, since it is turn father?", "YTA. He's YOUR dad, that means YOU sacrifice for him.", "YTA - she\u2019s an adult woman and has absolutely no obligation to allow her boyfriend\u2019s father to sleep in her bed. You not liking her bed but not wanting your dad to be on the couch is a you problem, she offered a very reasonable compromise to share her bed with you while your dad is visiting. Holding rent over her head as a means of control is an extra asshole move. If her not paying part of the rent is a problem, that\u2019s a negotiation completely separate from this.", "your girlfriend is right because you didn't plan this beforehand and basically told her to get out of her room", "YTA for not planning and communicating better.\n\nYou should have figured out sleeping arrangements before your dad got there. Give your dad your bed. You sleep on the sofa or get an air mattress. Or get your dad a hotel room like your gf suggested so everyone can be comfortable.\n\nYou let your girlfriend move in, have her own room and not pay rent. It is still her apartment as she lives there. If you want a different arrangement talk about it instead of painting her like a freeloader who has no rights.\n\nShe could have been more understanding but you treated her like she was in the way and assumed it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to tell her how things were going to be. That is a sucky way to treat someone.", "I\u2019m going against the grain with YTA. That room is her designated space. You have no right to offer it to a man without her consent. The rest of this, not paying rent, sleeping separately, etc. are terms you both agreed to beforehand. That doesn\u2019t make this just your house. You agreed to share the space. Why not swap with your dad? Or have him sleep with you? He is your guest, after all.", "Wait, gf offers to pay rent, you say no, then fail to plan for your 70yo dad\u2019s visit, then expect her to be okay with an old boomer stranger using her bed?? I think I\u2019m getting second hand nauseous \ud83e\udd22 YTA big time. No way I\u2019d be cool with that", "Comparing this room to a \"man cave\" here is misleading on OPs part and we shouldn't play into it. She sleeps there-- it's her bedroom. OP is in a relationship where each member of the couple has their own bedroom. It's not \"their room and her room\", it's \"his room and her room\".", "Have you heard the tale of the sexless inkeeper. NTA", "This definitely changes the perspective.  OP can sleep on the couch whether it's his apartment or not.  I'd let my parent sleep in my room and sleep on the couch or share my room with my parent.  These details changed my opinion from NTA to YTA.", "Even if she did. No matter, because the main issue is that she isn\u2019t compassionate enough to treat OP\u2019s dad to a proper bed for a few days. Even were the apartment perfectly 50/50 between OP and GF, this still wouldn\u2019t be good of her.", "Thanks! I can never remember how to pull those up", "Todays best comment. If i had any awards you'd get one. Now you just get my gratitude for making me smile.", "I\u2019m beginning to wonder if she is his GF, given the refusal to sleep in his room.  The OP says it\u2019s his home since he pays rent, making it seems like she owes him something that he willingly offered.", "OP said that he needs a proper place to sleep so HIM taking the couch is out of the question. Better send his senior dad to the couch.", "He's said in comments (hopefully not deleted lol) that they cosleep occasionally now but that she sleeps better alone.\n\nBut honestly...things about this story just aren't matching up. I'm more and more getting the vibe that the OP is leaving out something big like this, or completely lying although.", "Agreed. But also OP is being an AH to his own dad (not to the girlfriend). He really should have given his dad his own bed instead of the couch", "You are literally in a chain about people arguing if she'd be a tenant. In my places she'd legally be a tenant after a certain period of time (such as a month.) even if she isn't on the lease.\n\nShe also offered to pay rent but OP declined.\n\nLastly, there are some legitimate circumstances where only one person is not contributing towards the rent, even if it's a girlfriend or boyfriend. You don't know all the details to their arrangement. She could be covering utilities, groceries, doing a bulk of the chores, etc,.", "What would be preparing ahead?", "Figuring out something that isn't leaving your elderly dad to sleep on your couch, obviously. Including offering up your own bed for your own parent, long before your father spends one night on the couch."]}
