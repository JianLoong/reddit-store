But she doesn\u2019t.", "Found the entitled one.", "The man gave his gf a \"woman cave\" in an apartment that he paid 100% for. \n\nBut yea hes an AH because how dare he ask her to allow his father sleep in her room", "Ok but living space is definitely about who pays. Why is someone who didn\u2019t contribute to the cost of the place have a say in if they get a room or not. It\u2019s like the kid who didn\u2019t do shit on the project coming in the last day freeloading asking for the best grade and all the credit for not doing shit.", "While I don't disagree with you,  and think this one leaves a lot of things to the imagination, it's really hard for me to call him in the wrong for wanting to give a bed to a 70 year old.", "They both have this very transactional relationship, and in this case she's not afraid to stand up to him. He's not the only AH.", "Transactional? In what part of the story does it make it seem like she gives anything? She seems like a freeloading, entitled brat.", "Well I would guess that she is MUCH more attractive (and probably  signing younger) than he is and yes he is buying her time with a separate room and free rent.", "And gf could pay rent", "She, on the other hand, is", "I wouldn't want to cram in a twin bed either if there was a larger bed.", "That's the dad lol", "We had 2 bedrooms and a living room, we often had family and friends visiting us, we also hung together a lot. In my country, a living room is a \u201cmust\u201d.", "Yes needs her free woman cave, and it isn\u2019t the one time a month she lowers herself to share a room with her meal ticket.", "Nods.\n\nThat attitude was used on two of my aunts by their now ex husbands. It's creepy and abusive AF.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t pay rent so you don\u2019t get one of the two bedrooms in this apartment for your own\u201d is more like it.", "What's shitty logic is comparing literal children and the fact that they don't pay rent to a full grown ass woman who doesn't pay rent. She is dating OP yet won't make an effort to give up her free room for a few weeks for her boyfriends father? It's not a permanent situation, he's visiting.\n\nTo me this just shows that she doesn't care about OP's family at all and is incredibly selfish. I don't get how you could be so callous towards your partners parents for no reason.", "He said his girlfriend's bed is too small for both of them to fit in comfortably, but that still would have been a better situation than having his elderly dad sleep on the couch.", "If it were truly an issue then he shouldn't have allowed it in the first place.", "Don't see anywhere him saying she has to start paying rent.", "> As the only person paying for the place, the bf has every right to adjust the living arrangements as he sees fit.\n\nThis is a slippery slope to financial abuse. That\u2019s like saying any stay at home spouse gets no say in what happens in their household because they don\u2019t contribute to the bills.\n\nI agree that the girlfriend is being selfish, but OP agreed to the girlfriend living rent free and gave her the room to use as she sees fit. It\u2019s his guest. Ultimately it is OP\u2019s issue to resolve (by him sleeping on the couch). If he wants to change the agreement with the girlfriend going forward, they need to discuss it, but you can\u2019t just unilaterally dictate changes like that.", "Then NTA. A reasonable solution to the issue. Just a tip though. Lay off the \u201cI pay the rent\u201d just a little. She\u2019s your GF so I\u2019m assuming you want her there. In this situation it\u2019s reasonable to ask for this arrangement regardless of who pays rent, however you paying rent doesn\u2019t mean you can just kick her out of her room for any reason. Not saying you would do that at all just throwing it out there.", "Where's he going to put his luggage? Will he remove all of his stuff from the room as soon as he wakes up so he won't need to enter it at all til bedtime? Maybe his luggage will be in your room while he occupies her room? So he doesn't need to use the room during the day?", "In most cultures men pay for everything and wife pays for nothing. Do the wives have to follow orders because they\u2019re not paying rent?", "SAHP are not even remotely related to this conversation.", "To be fair, don't most people who are married and raising kids together sleep in the same bed at night? Doesn't seem like giving up a man/woman cave would be the end of the world.", "Then he's got some more lapse in judgement for that. He chose to do that.", "What a creepy opinion. I sure hope your spouse/future spouse never becomes a SAH. They'll get no say in anything.", "You're not Op so quit answering like you are.", "I own my own house.\n\nSwing and a miss, kiddo.", "Doesn't say her bed isn't a double, just it's not as big as the one is his room\n\nAlso doesn't say she doesn't pay all the bills while he pays the rent, I know my boyfriend and I had that arrangement at one point, because it worked out about us both paying the same rather than us paying half each of everything we split half the bills mine half his", "I'm just amused you think a room needs to be shared nightly for regular sex to be happening.", "And why can't the bf stay on the couch?\n\nAlso I specifically mentioned stay at home parents as well so lol. Many of whom do suffer financial abuse with the very logic.", "Or OP could have slept on the couch?", "Agreed. Unfortunately we don't have enough information about there relationship, so I guess we can't really make judgement", "Sure you can. gf is a guest. So is dad. He's asking one guest to make a temporary sacrifice for another. Seems like a reasonable request to me. \n\nBut you're saying that if bf wanted to turn the second room into an office because he got a new wfh job, then he's out of luck because he already gave the room to gf? Sorry, I don't agree with that. \n\nBtw, not every instance of a payer asking a non-payer to give up something (even for 3 whole days) is a slippery slope towards financial abuse. How many concessions must this man make to let people sleep at the home he's paying for?", "No wives or husbands were inconvenienced in the course of this post.", "But she\u2019s not thrown out of the apartment! It\u2019s a \u201cwoman cave\u201d and she just prefers to sleep there. OP asked her to sleep WITH HIM for A FEW DAYS?!

Sounds very different then your girlfriend getting a free ride.", "I'm sure they'd say yes.", "Historically \u2026 well yes.", "Ya ..you actually need to be a wife for that to be the case. This woman is just a girlfriend.", "Depends. I keep a separate bedroom from my partner. He's a loud sleeper, and I work very early in the morning.  It's just better for both of us that I have my own bed. Relationships can absolutely be healthy while still not cosleeping.", "No, it's his apartment he can pretty much do what he wants. Not to mention his request was entirely reasonable.", "Live in partners don't deserve the same treatment as a SAHM/D\n\n\nLet's be real here if this was bum ass man in his man cave everyone will tell his ass to get on the couch", "Stay at home parents are a totally different situation.

Never said I was answering for OP, nerd.", "That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not entitled kiddo.", "You honestly read that and think for a second they are having sex? She\u2019s less than a roommate to him, that would entail paying anything towards being there.", "Or his gf can act like a reasonable human being.", "I don't get how you guys don't see her as being rude as hell lol. OP's girlfriend is incredibly selfish and is being a literal child here", "OP agreed to let his girlfriend live there rent free. That's on him. He doesn't get to hold a decision that he made himself over her head. That's a really lousy thing to do to someone.", "And that's the logic that leads to people abusing their partners financially.", "So true.", "100%", "I'm an equal opportunity offender. Genitalia is irrelevant. Your guest so you move.", "Sounds like her living with op rent free was a decision the couple made together.

So entitled that I own my own place.\n\nHilarious, kiddo.", "And oddly enough, people on this sub (rightfully) complain about financial abuse all the time.", "But why?  She has no issue sharing a bed with OP since the occasionally do it.  Why would it make more sense for someone to sleep on the couch when they can share a bed and the other person get the other bed?\n\nHis gf just being stubborn don't you think", "We have no reason to think she is doing the cooking and sex, although, admittedly, no reason to think she isn't. Either way, why does she have a problem with spending a few nights in bed with her partner?", "How low is your IQ that you think entitlement deals strictly with home ownership?
