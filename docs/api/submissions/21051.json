And at some point he will feel like she did something to slip his control \"too much\" or he will make up something to remind her how he can be.\n\nIt wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't a coincidence that he came in while SIL was doing an interview.\n\n[https://voicemalemagazine.org/abusive-men-describe-the-benefits-of-violence/](https://voicemalemagazine.org/abusive-men-describe-the-benefits-of-violence/)\n\n>One night I started the group by asking the men what they thought the benefits were of their violence. At first they all looked at each other (notably) and said, \u201cThere are no benefits.\u201d This did not surprise me, as men who batter routinely deny their actions\u2014as they deny their intents as well. So I said, \u201cWell, there must be some benefits from the violence; otherwise why would you do it?\u201d They looked at each other again and then one guy started admitting there were benefits, and then they all chimed in until the four-by-eight-foot blackboard I was writing their responses on was full.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The first time I did this exercise I looked at the blackboard and I thought, \u201cOh my God. Why would they give it up?\u201d I then decided to ask the men: Why give it up? They then filled a two-by-two foot space on the blackboard with things like, \u201cget arrested,\u201d \u201cdivorce,\u201d \u201cget protection orders taken out against you,\u201d \u201cadult kids don\u2019t invite you to their weddings,\u201d \u201chave to go to groups like this.\u201d That was about it.", "Since he left, I wouldn't let him come back. Tell him he isn't welcome.", "Yeah, and make sure that you keep the lines very open and obvious too. You want him to think twice about everything because he knows if she asks for it, her brother will be right there and make him feel pitiful and small (rightfully) again. \n\nMaybe send Niece postcards from towns they pass through? Just pop into the welcome centers, or little touristy businesses. They don\u2019t have to be expensive, I think they\u2019re 3/$1 at the cute cheese factory near here.\n\nNiece gets a regular reminder that her uncle adores her, and every delivery reminding Asshole that eyes are on him.", "I mean, it might be fake but I\u2019ve called many people in my life a damn good/fine woman or man. It\u2019s not a phrase that seems strange to me, I wouldn\u2019t blink to hear it in the supermarket either in NC where I am now or Texas where I was raised.", "I respectfully disagree. However, I feel like your vote should be more E S H than Y T A. The BIL is a full blown asshole. I personally believe that OP is NTA. SIL's love life has been ruined already, and I think that OP would absolutely help SIL with whatever she needs wherever this situation goes. Just my 2 cents", ">A 16 year getting willed a home, in USA, well become the person of the legal guardian/parents.\n\nI am not sure what you are trying to say here but if you are saying a minor cannot be willed property in their own name in the USA you are wrong. A 16 year old can most definitely own property separate from her parents; her legal guardians are responsible for the costs and upkeep of the property until she reaches legal age and can live there with her, but it is still her property not theirs.\n\nOnce the 16 year old becomes a legal adult (18 or 21 depending on the state) the house and it's costs become her responsibility and she can choose to let one or both of her parents continue to live there or kick them out, because *it is her house.*", "She was on *a phone interview!* And if OP doesn't stand up to him, who will?", "It won't. But I'd still do it because fuck him.", "More likely he'll just be harder on her when they're not around.", "I definitely agree - I think i was looking for terms like that and used below the belt as a substitute for what I couldn\u2019t think of haha", "Only the devil knows this disgusting scene. Reassure her that you care about her and the kids, that they all deserve basic respect, and that you'll always have her back", "I also don't think he will change, and i also think the only reason he left is because op and husband are repairing his house - otherwise i fully believe he would have kicked them out, or at least tried\n\nBut SIL also needs a reality check. This man does not love her or he wouldn't treat her this way. I even doubt he respects her. She needs to get rid of this loser", "I mean by way of how she treats her in laws", "You feelin\u2019 weak? Good! Why don\u2019t you lay down and sleep? Earl?", "How old are you?\n\nYou have never had to do this it would seem.\nEver had to go to court to face your abuser, had bank accounts separated etc?\n\nIt would seem you are very immature if you are an adult", "Oh I fully agree that he is an A as well so ratting should have been ESH. However I assumed that the question was is OP an A toward SIL not her husband.", "One can only hope he leaves and never comes back.", "Absolutely. Even if she\u2019s right in thinking no one else would ever love her (doubtful)\u2026 better to be single forever than stuck with a massive asshole!", "He definitely doesn't love or respect her.  He sounds like he got with her to take advantage of her, manipulate her so he can have it easy with the power and control and gaslight her into sticking around and caring for him while he doesn't contribute.  Basically, a leech that has manipulated its host into thinking its a mutually beneficial situation.", "Plus deal with custody issues, since there\u2019s a kid involved.", "Then how about some empathy?", "Right this is a very sad situation all the way around", "I have come to realize there are two kinds of people in the world. \n\nSome of us have experiences and as a result want to help others having those same experiences, want to keep others from having to go through it and feel deep empathy for people going through that or similar things. \n\nThe other half have experiences and see others struggling and take stances like: well it happened to me and I came out fine, they just need to suck it up, I had to do it why should they get it easier, I got myself out of there aren\u2019t then it\u2019s their fault. \n\nIt\u2019s weird. And as a member of the first group I REALLY don\u2019t understand the second group. Also, it seems clear to me they have NOT come out fine, but they are unable to see that. Also, it helps to know that the population has a variable level of empathy- not everyone\u2019s empathy dial is on the same setting.", "Empathy tends to end up turning into madness, seeing the person repeat the same things in Loop", "I do have empathy, that\u2019s why I feel that victims of abusive situations should leave. It\u2019s more empathetic to sadly look on as people suffer from abuse? That\u2019s not my kind of empathy\u2026", "People are not so black and white and every expression is not directly related to some quantitative value of empathy that someone has. You can\u2019t measure empathy so simply. Tough love is a thing and is not a symbol of a lack of empathy. This is a tough world and people end up in hard situations and have to make some tough decisions. Leaving an abusive relationship is hard but not more challenging than staying. Staying is the most challenging thing anyone can do and it will only get worse. Especially if there are children, the parent in the situation needs to leave an abusive situation and get to safety because they need to protect their children. I\u2019m not for sitting back and watching people suffer because they are being manipulated and they are being weak. People need to realize their strength and protect themselves and their children.", "I feel like you\u2019re describing sympathy more than empathy. Empathy is completely putting yourself in their shoes and understanding/ recognizing exactly how they feel. \n\nYes, of course she should leave her husband. But blatantly telling someone to leave their abusive relationship doesn\u2019t really articulate that you understand all of the nuances and challenges that individual may be facing and what\u2019s holding them back from taking that leap. \n\nI really like Brene browns [video](https://youtu.be/KZBTYViDPlQ) on empathy vs sympathy.", ">. Tough love is a thing\n\nSaid by every abuser everywhere. Whole trauma subs are filled with stories about it, and how it's always the tough part and rarely the love part, and when the love part is seemingly there, it pales in comparisson to how tough the tough part is.", "Oh no. You mean people aren\u2019t just Terri types without nuance??? Our individual personalities? I\u2019m shocked. SHOCKED I tell you. \n\nI know the idea that someone might generalize to make something easier to write up in a comment thread while knowing it\u2019s more complex than that is shocking to you, but here we are. \n\nAlso: \n\nSee the post where I mentioned we don\u2019t ask have the same case empathy. \n\nAnd not how I *specifically didn\u2019t mention* WHY people might go one way or the other??\n\nIt\u2019s Reddit, I\u2019m not writing a dissertation.", "I don\u2019t have to put myself in the shoes of someone in an abusive relationship because I have been there myself. I know that leaving an abusive situation is not harder than staying in one. I know that the SIL in this story is with an abuser who does nothing to contribute to her family financially or anything at all. He literally sits on his ass and yells at people all day. I\u2019m not going to observe such a situation with enough \u201cempathy\u201d to think it\u2019s inescapable. SIL can toss his ass to the curb yesterday. Can do it 10 years ago. He is contributing nothing. He is a leech. He is only there because she allows him to be. She needs to stop. She\u2019s not a little girl. It\u2019s sad that she is in this position but she needs to take responsibility and make the changes she needs to better enjoy her life and to give her children a better life."]}
