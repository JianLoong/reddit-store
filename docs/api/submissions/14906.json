{"id": 14906, "submission_id": "12nse1v", "title": "AITA for walking away from my sister\u2019s wedding and ruining her reception?", "selftext": "I (26F) have two sisters, \u201cShirley\u201d who is 28, and \u201cMary\u201d who is 21. Shirley\u2019s getting married, and her naturally bossy and controlling nature has caused few dramas in all the months of planning.\n\nAt the beginning Shirley had six bridesmaids (me, Mary, three friends and her SIL). Friend1 walked away because Shirley wanted us to contribute 300$ each for the bachelorette. And a few weeks later, her SIL walked away because Shirley wanted the two blondes of the group (her and Mary) to go brunette so that we could all match. All of this stress has caused Shirley to act even more controlling and snappy, especially to our little sister, a very passive person who has always sought her approval. Mary changed her hair colour, lost three kilos, agreed to look after the guest\u2019s children during part of the reception, and got a week off work to help her prepare everything, all because Shirley wanted her to.\n\nFinally the big day came yesterday and Shirley was yelling at everyone during hair and make-up. At some point she caught Mary eating and made a rude comment about that being the reason why she still looks fat in the dress (I must add that Shirley got her a dress two sizes smaller than everyone else's), I bit my tongue and tried to understand that she was just under a lot of stress and not to ruin her one special day. I took Mary and went to do our makeup in another room until our sister calmed down, which caused some drama but Shirley got over it quickly.\n\nThe biggest drama happened during the reception. Mary thought she was supposed to watch the children during the speeches, cutting the cake, and first dances to make sure no child ruined the footage of those moments. But before any of that could happen, I found Shirley yelling in Mary's face in the back of the venue. Apparently, there was some essential footage Shirley wanted to get at the beginning of the ceremony, and it was now ruined because Mary was somewhere else. I intervened, Shirley started yelling at me, and I yelled back. She said we were ruining her wedding, and I told her that we would do better on her next one. Eventually, Mary (who had had a few drinks) threw up from the stress.\n\nNeedless to say, Shirley got even angrier. I could take the yelling, but when she grabbed Mary\u2019s arm, I reached my breaking point and finally walked out, taking Mary with me.\n\nWe missed about 70% of the reception, leaving Shirley without a maid of honour's speech and without babysitting. Word got around, and some people told me that everyone was talking about it and speculating what happened. Mary didn\u2019t want to leave, and she is feeling really bad that Shirley is not talking to us yet. Now, I'm wondering if I should have just sucked it up for a few more hours instead of ruining her special day. We are all really close, and I don't know if it was worth damaging our relationship for a bit of an attitude. But I couldn\u2019t stand to see Mary treated so poorly by someone she looks up to so much.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1681613365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nse1v/aita_for_walking_away_from_my_sisters_wedding_and/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Out-fucking-rageous!! No no and uh NO! Bridesmaids are human beings not little dress up matchy matchy dolls you prop up next to you. UGH and gross. \n\nPoor Mary needs to grow a pair (of ovaries) and stand up to this nonsense. You did right to pull her out of that highly charged situation. No one should be treated like that ever.

We give a lot of leeway to those whose wedding scenarios are brought up in the reddit, but your sister is a downright bully. There\u2019s no sugarcoating it. You were justified in standing up for Mary and yourself. Your sister owes you both an apology and don\u2019t let anyone else convince you otherwise.", "NTA, I'd have done worse tbh. Please urge Mary to consider trying therapy though. And to not give up if she does give it a shot and the first therapist doesn't work out, it can take a few tries until you find someone you click with. She definitely needs some help to work on her lack of self esteem and inability stand up for herself. (This isn't me blaming Mary btw, sometimes we just need help to be our best selves and to learn how to communicate and set boundaries.) I also hope you can both go NC with Shirley eventually, she sounds like a terror you'd be better off without.

If four of six bridesmaids took a hike, it\u2019s because she was the ahole", "NTA - your sister is awful.", "NTA. It seems your sister didn't learn from the first couple friends walking out of her event. She should've realized she can't just treat people badly and expect them to still not only want to stick around but fork out money to her and her events.\n\nEither she didn't learn that at all, or she just thought she could still treat you and Mary badly because you are family. So she might have just thought she could treat you guys badly but you'll put up with it because you're family and she can hold you hostage. Which based on your mention of Mary being passive seems REALLY likely.\n\nYour sister essentially gave you guys the choice of being treated like dog shit, or choose not to. She put you in a situation where it was stfu and be abused constantly or stand up against abusive treatment and then be blamed and massively guilt tripped for \"ruining her sPeCiAl dayyyyy\"\n\nYou sister is 1000% the asshole and you and Mary reacted the way any reasonable person would and should. I honestly hope you hold your bridezilla sister accountable and expect an apology for yourself but ESPECIALLY FOR MARY. Your asshole sister owes Mary the world's biggest apology. And if I was Mary I might not forgive your sister for her treatment and all that bullshit about Mary's weight. Your sister used her wedding as an excuse to show Mary how *she really feels* about her.

You say you are \u201cvery close\u201d but are you sure you want to be??

First of all, I pity the groom who might end up being the next Mary in the situation. In the future, the relationship would have become a toxic one with Shirley being the toxic one. I hope he's ok.\n\nSecond of all, you're really brave to stand up for your sister especially if this happens a lot. At this point, you and Mary should start keeping some distance away from Shirley. I think staying around Shirley longer may be the reason Mary doesn't seem to find her own voice to stand up for herself. Keeping some distance allows you two to move on from Shirley and become more confident.\n\nI'm rooting for you and Mary.", "NTA clearly, there\u2019s nothing more you could have done. There was nothing to satisfy your sister that day. She didn\u2019t take any of the criticism from the bridesmaids that left, and took all her rage out on her younger sisters.

Like, aggressively hurting you all. Not just by doing one thing wrong without thinking, but continually. No matter how stressed she is, none of what she's done is okay. How she's treated her bridesmaids is awful. You didn't ruin anything. It would have only gotten worse.", "NTA Shirley ruined her own reception and when her true colors start to show with her husband she will be divorced within two years or so. I would advise that op and Mary stay away from Shirley what I read in this post is very disturbing and sounds like abusive behavior, I\u2019m sure this wedding isn\u2019t the only time this type of behavior has happened.", "NTA- but also not the worst wedding I've seen.
