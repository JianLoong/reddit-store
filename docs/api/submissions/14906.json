{"id": 14906, "submission_id": "12nse1v", "title": "AITA for walking away from my sister\u2019s wedding and ruining her reception?", "selftext": "I (26F) have two sisters, \u201cShirley\u201d who is 28, and \u201cMary\u201d who is 21. Shirley\u2019s getting married, and her naturally bossy and controlling nature has caused few dramas in all the months of planning.\n\nAt the beginning Shirley had six bridesmaids (me, Mary, three friends and her SIL). Friend1 walked away because Shirley wanted us to contribute 300$ each for the bachelorette. And a few weeks later, her SIL walked away because Shirley wanted the two blondes of the group (her and Mary) to go brunette so that we could all match. All of this stress has caused Shirley to act even more controlling and snappy, especially to our little sister, a very passive person who has always sought her approval. Mary changed her hair colour, lost three kilos, agreed to look after the guest\u2019s children during part of the reception, and got a week off work to help her prepare everything, all because Shirley wanted her to.\n\nFinally the big day came yesterday and Shirley was yelling at everyone during hair and make-up. At some point she caught Mary eating and made a rude comment about that being the reason why she still looks fat in the dress (I must add that Shirley got her a dress two sizes smaller than everyone else's), I bit my tongue and tried to understand that she was just under a lot of stress and not to ruin her one special day. I took Mary and went to do our makeup in another room until our sister calmed down, which caused some drama but Shirley got over it quickly.\n\nThe biggest drama happened during the reception. Mary thought she was supposed to watch the children during the speeches, cutting the cake, and first dances to make sure no child ruined the footage of those moments. But before any of that could happen, I found Shirley yelling in Mary's face in the back of the venue. Apparently, there was some essential footage Shirley wanted to get at the beginning of the ceremony, and it was now ruined because Mary was somewhere else. I intervened, Shirley started yelling at me, and I yelled back. She said we were ruining her wedding, and I told her that we would do better on her next one. Eventually, Mary (who had had a few drinks) threw up from the stress.\n\nNeedless to say, Shirley got even angrier. I could take the yelling, but when she grabbed Mary\u2019s arm, I reached my breaking point and finally walked out, taking Mary with me.\n\nWe missed about 70% of the reception, leaving Shirley without a maid of honour's speech and without babysitting. Word got around, and some people told me that everyone was talking about it and speculating what happened. Mary didn\u2019t want to leave, and she is feeling really bad that Shirley is not talking to us yet. Now, I'm wondering if I should have just sucked it up for a few more hours instead of ruining her special day. We are all really close, and I don't know if it was worth damaging our relationship for a bit of an attitude. But I couldn\u2019t stand to see Mary treated so poorly by someone she looks up to so much.\n\nSo, reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1681613365, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nse1v/aita_for_walking_away_from_my_sisters_wedding_and/", "score": 1408, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So she might have just thought she could treat you guys badly but you'll put up with it because you're family and she can hold you hostage.

It's a big day for him too ! But why put so much pressure on yourself and everyone else, trying to make everything pErFEct. \"But it's my big day!!\"\n\nYou'll have many big days in your life. Yes, this is ONE of them, but only one. Chill out, brides ! Calm the f down !\n\nA wedding should be a celebration of love. Not a battleground.", ">I don't know if it was worth damaging our relationship for a bit of an attitude. \n\nYes re: abuse victims. Also, OP makes it seem as if she herself was the one damaging the relationship, instead of her horrible abusive sister. \n\nNTA because\u2026just no.", "Which is bizarre to me since I've always thought of emerald green as one of the colors that tends to make redheads' hair pop and skin glow, especially auburn. I've never seen that color not look fantastic on any redhead I've known", "My wife told her bridesmaids to get whatever dress they were comfortable with, it just had to be a specific colour (a really nice dark blue that looked good on everyone).", "New level of bridezilla - bridegorgon", "Yeah sounds like older sister is jealous of her younger thinner prettier sister. \n\nNTA- she was treating her little sister like a verbal punching bag. Attacking belittling and blaming her every step of the way. I feel bad for Mary trying to look up to someone so low.", "i think that one depends. like idk about you but my hair does some funky shit when it starts to fade, i'd probably strip it and go neutral to avoid looking like a clown", "For my own wedding I'm going to get infinity dresses for my bridesmaids.

Zilla is already the max so a bridegorgon would have to be one level down.", "I didn't state that very well. I would make sure it looked good I just wouldn't dye it a natural color.", "I admit mi mind went to demogorgon rather then Greek mytology gorgon, but I guess I stand corrected either way.", "I\u2019m certainly not going to argue with you about a speculation I made that there might be more to the story.", "Sorry, but seeing the possibility that Mary could be ah just kind of set me off. She literally dyed her hair and lost weight (while already being the thinnest one there) just for her sister\u2019s approval."]}
