We ordered takeout but because I had been drinking, I didn't eat much and decided to save it for later.  I ended up going to bed but some people decided to stay up. When I woke up I went to get my kebab but couldn't find it anywhere. I asked Jake and John where it was since they said they had cleaned the kitchen for us and they said they threw it away. I should note that I had put it on a plate and put the plate in the microwave overnight.\n\nI gave them a look and asked why. The kebab was massive- it took up the whole of a 12-inch pizza box and I ate maybe 4 bites. I had also paid for it so it was \u00a312 down the drain (which is a lot for me, honestly). They couldn't give me an answer but I was just frustrated and told them to leave. I don't know what it was about the situation, but it bugged me so much.\n\nMike came downstairs and asked what was going on and I explained. He said they should stay but they said it would be awkward and left. After they left, Mike said I was being overdramatic and petty. He said it was an honest mistake. I asked how throwing away a whole plate of food was a mistake?\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: [here](https://imgur.com/a/EXnaNkd) is a picture of the kebab. I had eaten the flatbread on top and some of the vegetables but that was it.\n\nEDIT 2: I hadn't planned on leaving it in the microwave all night. I had planned on eating it later that hour but passed out.\n\nEDIT 3: Didn't think this needed adding but\n\nQ-  'Very important info: how long were you asleep?'\n\nA- 'I'm not entirely sure but the movie that was playing when I went into the other room was still on when I came back through so no more than an hour and a half.'\n\nI guess the food still would have been out for longer than 2 hours at that point though.\n\nEDIT 4: I text Jake asking to talk when they wake up (it's 2am lol) so hopefully we can get things sorted. I also got another kebab. Pray for me.

Most people in Portugal (where I live), UK and France (mentioning these countries only as it's where I have family and close friends) do leave food in the microwave if the intention is to eat in a couple of hours of by next day. Some people don't put certain foods in the fridge because it might taste weird after being in the fridge, it might leave smell onto other foods (making them taste weird) or the other way around, or might leave a smell inside the fridge.\n3) Even if it was already bad, it's not the friends'house. They should've asked OP if it was okay to throw out. Or if they were so concerned about the food, why not take away from microwave, correctly seal it inside a tupperware or something and put it in the fridge?? Not throw away someone else's food!", "Yta. If you really wanted it you would have put it away properly. Live and learn", "NTA. I'm not sure that I would have kicked them out about it but I am wondering if they were just cleaning up the mess from the celebration than I'm not really sure what they were doing in the microwave. They obviously didn't have anything in there if your dinner was in there unless you have an unusually large microwave. Lastly common sense would tell me that if I found a full plate of food in the microwave it was there for a reason.", "thats alot of food. i dont think housemates friends have any right to chuck your stuff. however, i dont think you hve the right to kick them out either. that would be mike's call unless there is a specific rule they violated or there are specific rules in place where you get to kick other's guests out. ESH", "NTA but I do think you over reacted. They are assholes for eating or throwing your food, but it could have been a genuine mistake (if they did actually clean the kitchen) if they didn't know you were gonna finish your food. \n\nI would normally clean the kitchen out and throw out bits of unfinished food (or put it in the fridge if there's lots of it that could be eaten). I think if you told them you were gonna eat it, they wouldn't throw it. However it's not their home or food so they should have just popped it in the fridge if they were cleaning. I do think kicking them out for it was probably unnecessary because its probably caused you more grief than its worth.", "YTA - Food forgotten in the microwave was thrown out by people who were cleaning up after your party.", "NTA \n\nIt wasn't theirs to throw away or eat.", "Food that doesn\u2019t spoil easy can be left in a microwave for a decent amount of time honestly, but even if their intentions were to clean out of kindness, the safest option would have been to box the food and keep it in the fridge for OP to decide what to do later. \nGuests should never decide what to do with other people\u2019s food. If they\u2019re helping they should ask, if they can\u2019t ask then don\u2019t touch it. It\u2019s not their microwave, so what\u2019s the hurry to clean? Weird situation. \nNTA.", "YTA. To me it sounds like you had a fun birthday night, went to bed, they cleaned up the kitchen and threw away the kebab. It doesn\u2019t sound like they did this to fuck you over or anything. I get being upset but you could\u2019ve easily asked for the 12$ instead of throwing them out of the house.", "YTA... Whether they threw it out or ate it, you left it in the microwave and passed out. Zero chance I would think you were saving it for later.", "NTA, but the microwave is not an appropriate place to store food you want to eat later.", "NTA", "Ehhhhhh it was left in the microwave \u2026 that\u2019s not a great habit BTW, I once ate food left in the microwave for a few hours and got some pretty knarly food poisoning. They probably thought someone forgot food in there and tossed it. Better safe than sorry. Next time put the food in the fridge. If you were too drunk to do that, oh well \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s ok to be kinda pissed but this really isn\u2019t a big deal", "Did you check the trash to see if they ate it? NTA.", "I'm also British and messing with someone's drunk kabab is a big no! They deffo ate it! Cheeky AF mate. Get them to confess, they owe you another kabab. NTA", "NTA. It's not their house so them throwing away your food is so disrespectful. They owe you a meal. I don't blame you for kicking them out.", "NAH. To be fair I would toss food left in a Microwave myself. If you wanted to save it for later why wouldn\u2019t you put it in the fridge. Leaving it out increases the risk of bacterial growth", "They ate it and lied to you, so you are not the asshole, but put your kebab in the fridge. don't leave it in the microwave you're just asking yourself to get sick in the morning when you go to eat it.", "NTA\n\nAs other's have stated...they didn't throw the food away\n\nthey ate it", "Mate they ate his kebab which cost him 12 quid.", "Just because it was in the microwave it doesn't mean it's going to be bad the next morning (assuming the friends just thought that OP wasn't going to wake up before morning).\nEven if it was Sumner, which isn't l, it wouldn't go bad. Exception might be mayonnaise or milk, but not during fucking winter!\nAnd even if it was going bad, it's not their food! Maximum they could do was ask to OP, when she woke up, if she still wanted it or not, and if yes they might go \"it was out for X hours, no sure if it would be okay for you to still eat it\". And then leave it to OP's decision. Besides, once you start eating, if the food ain't right you're gonna sense it and just spit it out.", ">I could see selfish entitled idiots seeing it as fair game.\n\nFTFY.", "Op later commented that it was left out for only 90 minutes.", "That's fairly arbitrary, but you also shouldn't chuck hot food in the fridge either (it will raise the temperature of other things and can bump the temp of the whole fridge up to cause other food to spoil), so depending on what it is 2 hours left out may not even be enough for it to have dropped down to room temperature.\n\nI leave things out overnight fairly regularly in the winter with no issues. And really, you can pass a couple of hours at a xmas dinner or something where people will still be picking at the food.\n\nI'm sure they just dummied it anyway.", "For exactly that reason, they didn\u2019t want to pay OP back. Which is weird bc if I threw away someone\u2019s food (never would, wtf) I would offer to repay. I don\u2019t feel bad for generalizing here, but no way guys at a guy hang out, getting drunk, spontaneously clean or care about food sitting out for a couple hours. They totally ate it.", "Buy a new one? What they should have said anyway but clearly STOLE it and have no intention of paying OP back for it.", "You didn't think of it bc you're not like this and you don't assume someone is lying to you. Totally normal. \n\nOn top of all this they're acting like it's your fault that things are awkward.\n\nNTA , but they are.", "An upset stomach could be a problem but the food being held under 141 in the temperature danger zone can lead to food poisoning", "I do just want to say that not all forms of food poisoning actually cause the food to look, smell, or taste off. I learned this after I got what I believe was a staph infection/food poisoning. It's very common on foods that are not cooked after making (sandwiches, pastries, deli meat).\n\nTo be fair, it's not a particularly dangerous form of food poisoning, but it is more than just a \"bellyache,\" and I'm sure it's not the only disease that doesn't cause obvious spoilage.", "Yeah I definitely ate pizza that sat out for almost 24 hrs to no ill effect.", "Yeah but picture the fact you're a little drunk ordered food to a mates house.\n\nSure throw away the empty delivery containers, clean the plates or glasses you might have used.\n\nBut why, at your friends house, go into a microwave you didn't use. And then find OPs food, which they ordered together and throw it away", "I'm a woman, and I absolutely do not!", "Yeah, that's kind of my stance.\n\nI certainly wouldn't eat anything left in a microwave that long, but as long as you don't serve it to me or other people, I could care less. OP's an adult, and if they get food poisoning that's on them.", "All these people are snobs. Acting like they never ate last night's pizza! \"Cooked food is safe for 90 mins\"?!?!! These people would be the first to go in the apocalypse! \ud83d\ude02 I cook many times at night, leave the food in the pot overnight, reheat it next day for lunch and eat it with no problems.\n\nThose guys were probably high so they ate your food and didn't know what to say.

I've seen baked goods stored in a microwave, but never something perishable.", "Depending on what exactly is the food, not all of it needa to go to the fridge for the night... And it is definitely not gross, sometimes it's worse when you do put it in the fridge because then the whole fridge smells like that and other food might get a weird flavor, or even the other way around.\n\nAlso, even if it was something that gets bad by being out for a night (all I can think of right now is mayo or milk), as a guest I don't know if the other person wants me to throw away the food. So I will leave it be. Especially if it is INSIDE A MICROWAVE.\n\nStop judging OP on where they decided to leave the food.

With the middle area being the \u201cdanger zone\u201d. Usually you want to avoid leaving things in the danger zone as much as possible. Especially meat. I\u2019ve just personally dealt with getting sick from some left out chicken.

And if these guys are students (as I suspect from their ages), there's a good chance their flat is basically the same temperature as inside a fridge, given the cost of heating right now.
