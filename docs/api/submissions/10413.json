We ordered takeout but because I had been drinking, I didn't eat much and decided to save it for later.  I ended up going to bed but some people decided to stay up. When I woke up I went to get my kebab but couldn't find it anywhere. I asked Jake and John where it was since they said they had cleaned the kitchen for us and they said they threw it away. I should note that I had put it on a plate and put the plate in the microwave overnight.\n\nI gave them a look and asked why. The kebab was massive- it took up the whole of a 12-inch pizza box and I ate maybe 4 bites. I had also paid for it so it was \u00a312 down the drain (which is a lot for me, honestly). They couldn't give me an answer but I was just frustrated and told them to leave. I don't know what it was about the situation, but it bugged me so much.\n\nMike came downstairs and asked what was going on and I explained. He said they should stay but they said it would be awkward and left. After they left, Mike said I was being overdramatic and petty. He said it was an honest mistake. I asked how throwing away a whole plate of food was a mistake?\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: [here](https://imgur.com/a/EXnaNkd) is a picture of the kebab. I had eaten the flatbread on top and some of the vegetables but that was it.\n\nEDIT 2: I hadn't planned on leaving it in the microwave all night. I had planned on eating it later that hour but passed out.\n\nEDIT 3: Didn't think this needed adding but\n\nQ-  'Very important info: how long were you asleep?'\n\nA- 'I'm not entirely sure but the movie that was playing when I went into the other room was still on when I came back through so no more than an hour and a half.'\n\nI guess the food still would have been out for longer than 2 hours at that point though.\n\nEDIT 4: I text Jake asking to talk when they wake up (it's 2am lol) so hopefully we can get things sorted. I also got another kebab. Pray for me.
