Uninvited physical contact is inappropriate. It doesn't have to be sexual or violent in nature to be inappropriate. Certain relationships have a baseline level of implied consent for casual touch. Workplace relationships are not one of them. When you're in a romantic relationship, it is generally acceptable to not ask consent every time you put your hand on their shoulder/back or nudge their arm because that's standard in a relationship. Some people don't like that and it's on them to set different boundaries, and you are responsible for obtaining consent (and clarifying parameters on continued consent) for anything beyond casual touch.\n\nIn the state where I live, if I tell someone not to touch me and they even just put their hand on my shoulder, they have committed battery and I can press charges. You don't put your hands on someone without their permission. It's not a difficult concept.\n\nYou're not an AH for setting boundaries. He is an asshole for throwing a fit over either feeling embarrassed that he's been called out on his inappropriate behavior, feeling **entitled to touch another person**, or both. \n\nNext time he says something about it, ask him in front of everyone why he feels he has more of a right to touch you than you have to decide *who* touches you.", "Wear the title of \"bitch\" proudly.

They sound like they are just trying to connect in a positive way in their mind.\n\nI could also see that how you reacted may have worried them as the wrong accusation could ruin someone's career when that was not the intent...but that being said, you deserve your space and wishes to be met. \n\nMaybe worth a follow up conversation and finding some common understanding. \n\nHe likely doesn't know the life you have lived to this point and sounds like you (admittedly) over reacted some.  \n\nIf truly a feeling of being uncomfortable,  HR is a good choice, otherwise being an adult and talking to them directly will get you further.

As a woman, we're constantly doing the math to weigh whether speaking up is going to make you more or less safe. This guy has shown that he is not safe, lashing out over you communicating discomfort.

The only correct response on his end would have been \"thank you for telling me, I'm sorry I made you uncomfortable, I won't touch you again.\" \nYou did the right thing standing up for yourself and what you are and are not ok with.

If it doesn't prevent harm and isn't required for the job, there is no reason to put your hand on a coworker without their consent. \n\nI worked in a pizza place and we would occasionally have to reach out to stop someone from backing into us in narrow spaces. That's acceptable and necessary. When the manager ignored me and another girl after we told him not to just walk over and touch us for no reason, we walked out. It wasn't sexual or threatening, but we didn't want him putting his hands on our shoulders/arms when he didn't need to. \n\nHe thought it was great fun to disregard our express wishes and \"annoy\" us.

He said that because you called him out on his unacceptable behavior? This is a typical tactic of such guys. Don't fall for it. It's a good idea to be sensitive to other people's feelings, as you do, but he's taking advantage of that. In that case, your soul should wear steel-toed boots.\n\nYou're a good person for being considerate of him, but he's playing you for a sucker. I'm sorry to have to say that.", "I think he is an asshole, to be honest. If he was a friend, he would've respected your boundaries. But he didn't. He ran around playing the victim.

Laying it all out like that is really helpful, I don't think I've done anything wrong, I think I feel bad because he said he is uncomfortable, I have been this whole time and wouldn't want someone else to feel that way, but he's uncomfortable because of his own actions being address not because of something I've done.", "True, I don't actually think I've done anything wrong, but he said it made him feel like he had done something wrong and was a bad guy. I don't want anyone to think they've done something wrong over just a friendly pat on the back and hug etc. But just for me that's uncomfortable, it's not really a \"him\" issue, it's very much a me thing so I'm sad he feels that way.", "Hi I totally get what your saying, I don't feel bad for calling him out on it and letting him know it's not acceptable to me in the future, and I certainly won't be changing my mind or following up with an \" I'm sorry ur hurt \" convo, I guess I just feel a bit guilty. But the more I think about it the more feeling bad seems unreasonable. All I did was tell him not to touch me, that doesn't seem like a big deal or big ask to me.", "i mean this as nicely as possible, it is a \"him\" issue. he doesn't actually feel like that and he's saying that to emotionally manipulate you. there's nothing wrong with a friendly pat when you have *permission*, he knows he didn't have yours but he feels entitled to touch you. he's not upset that you made him feel like a bad guy, he's upset you stood up to him so he can't touch you anymore.", "First, your feelings are your feelings, even feelings of guilt, so just own them (and cherish them, because in this case it shows you're a humane human). I'm sure you already know that **feeling** guilty (you get to feel guilty) and **being** guilty are two separate things. You should be proud for sticking up for yourself, because it isn't always easy.", "Yeah, that makes a lot of sense actually. Thanks for helping me see it in a clearer light!", "Awww thanks! That's really nice, youve been really helpful, Thanks for helping me see it wasn't my fault"]}
