Uninvited physical contact is inappropriate. It doesn't have to be sexual or violent in nature to be inappropriate. Certain relationships have a baseline level of implied consent for casual touch. Workplace relationships are not one of them. When you're in a romantic relationship, it is generally acceptable to not ask consent every time you put your hand on their shoulder/back or nudge their arm because that's standard in a relationship. Some people don't like that and it's on them to set different boundaries, and you are responsible for obtaining consent (and clarifying parameters on continued consent) for anything beyond casual touch.\n\nIn the state where I live, if I tell someone not to touch me and they even just put their hand on my shoulder, they have committed battery and I can press charges.

If anything you did good by standing up for yourself. \n\nBut I can see why he took it so personal. \n\nI am very empatic and try to always see others point of view.. often forgetting that I matter too but at the same time it gives me a good idea of how the \"male\" ego could be hurt in this. \n\nHe could've felt like you were sort of accusing him of being inappropriate in a different way that you meant. To you all touching is inappropriate (I get it. I hate being touched and hate hugs. I feel dirty when I hug people especially if they're crying or upset and I feel like I have to) but to him inappropriate touching could be basically sexual harassment. \n\nJust to safe work relationship you could try to explain to him how all touching makes you feel and ask him to respect that and maybe say \"I'm sorry if what I said hurt your feelings but this is how I feel. I didn't mean to come off rude or make assumptions. I just meant I do not like all touching as it makes me feel upset/hurt/violated. Everyone has different background and what you might see as okay could be perceived as not okay for others. So again I am sorry for not being more specific about how I felt and not really saying anything other than hinting at it\"\n\nI'd like to also remind you that there's a big possibility he didn't realise you stiffening up or getting upset over it as they cannot read your mind. You probably could've been more vocal from the start and set that boundary from the beginning. It would've avoided the discomfort now. \n\nThe only mistake you made was accepting his interactions and excusing them as \"its on the site and that's meant as a joke\". It is not okay just because they do it between themselves who know eachother for probably longer.  I made the same mistake and paid the consequences. \n\nBut yeah if you feel like wanting to save up appearances you might need to be more open about how it made you feel.\n\n\nIf the issue persists and he keeps bitching about it then just take it up to the boss as that would be borderline harassment", "NTA. Any unwanted touching is inappropriate touching, regardless of technicalities. Though, I\u2019d have said something sooner. I agree with you that he needs to respect your boundaries, but he might have assumed touching is okay because you hadn\u2019t said anything up till this point and he\u2019s being oversensitive now that the boundary\u2019s been established. The male ego is a fragile thing when they\u2019re told \u201cno\u201d.", "NTA. I hope you know that this is him trying to control the narrative of the situation in case you were to complain to someone higher. I assume you guys were alone when you spoke to him about it, so the fact that he\u2019s telling other people is just so he can have people on his side. So I would go to a superior and mention a hostile work environment because he\u2019s actively turning people against you for not wanting unnecessary touching", "I've had co-workers that were more  touchy feely than i wanted (not a sexual harassment way) and it's deeply uncomfortable and hard to address.

Get HR involved and each and every time he touches her should be clearly documented and he should be told each time \u201cPlease do not touch me, we have spoke about this before and you need to stop\u201d.  No\nOther explanation or justification is needed.  Then when he pouts and complains report it as creating a hostile work environment.  That should get attention.  Lastly, unwanted touching is often a power move especially when done by an older person to a younger person.\n OP should not make excuses why she feels the way she does, the fact that it\u2019s unwanted is enough.", "OP, read this twice. Great response.", "Wtf, there is NO need to clarify and get into JADE territory. He is 100% in the wrong and acting like a spoiled child when nicely called out. Pathetic.", "Oh goodness, it\u2019s on her to assuage his \u201churt feelings\u201d over being politely and discreetly told she doesn\u2019t like to be touched (at WORK no less) ???\n\nGood lord, this is why men are the way they are, because of the entitlement and the need for mommy to console them when they don\u2019t get to do exactly as they like with no consideration for others. \n\nSUCH eyeroll at your response.", "No no no no no. Not only did this guy ACTUALLY do something inappropriate to you, his response to you was downright abusive.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with [DARVO.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO) It\u2019s a tactic abusers use to make you and others confused about who\u2019s at fault. YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING WRONG.", "That sounds like he\u2019s kind of gaslighting you. Or just painting himself as a victim when he\u2019s clearly not. When you said he told everyone it sounds to me like he wanted to get out ahead of you in case you told anyone. That means he knew it was wrong. It\u2019s very unlikely he didn\u2019t know you were uncomfortable. \n\nI one time barely touched a female police officer on the shoulder when I was talking to her. I\u2019m a female. She threatened to arrest me for it. She told me it was illegal. I had no idea and it kind of made me feel like a criminal with how she said it. But you better believe I never did anything like that again.", "No. No. NO. Accept that co-worker is not a person you can explain things exactly right to for him to magically understand that you do not like to be touched. You cannot make a man (or woman) understand someothing they do not WANT to understand. That his feelings are hurt because you gave him a boundary shows that this is not a man that can be reasoned with. He does not want to understand that you do not like to be touched because he feels that his right to touch you is more important than you having bodily autonomy. Therefore he's sulking. He's weaponising his sulking by making sure everyone knows about his feelings, which is both very un-professional, but also very strategic. He's making sure people turn against you. You need to go on a counter-offensive - 'geez, I didn't know it was so important for John to keep touching women who do not want to be touched.' Or 'John is being so emotional about insisting on touching me, it's difficult to take him seriously.'  Also, you should go to HR and/or your manager to get your version of events in first.", "Not your  fault  ,it might be his way but he needs  to adapt  and respect  boundaries.  NtA op", "He is weaponizing his feelings, he is trying to make you feel bad. He sucks. You have nothing to feel badly about, you have every right to tell him you do not want him to touch you.

For instance when I worked in restaurants, I would gently place my hand on someone\u2019s shoulders to let them know that I\u2019m behind them so we don\u2019t bump into each other.  If they tell me they don\u2019t like being touched, I make a mental note of that and don\u2019t touch them again.  I don\u2019t act all butthurt and or take it as an insult because I know it\u2019s not a personal thing, it\u2019s just a boundary I know not to cross.  He\u2019s being manipulative, don\u2019t make the mistake of putting his comfort above your own.", "Op, I'll feel REALLY upset if you don't transfer me 5k dollars right now.

He's not entitled to you catering to his every whim.", "JADE territory???", "This absolutely is a him issue, not a you issue.

I guess just at the time when I heard he was upset and uncomfortable etc because of what I said I automatically felt bad because well I didn't wanna upset him, I just wanted him to stop touching me tbh, I know it's very small touches he's doing but it makes me uncomfortable and it kinda dulls my day, which is a bummer because I love my work and my site. So I guess I originally felt like \" oh it was only a small thing and now I've seriously upset him over it\" but the more comments I'm getting, the more I realise I have nothing to feel bad about.", "Hi, Thanks this helps a lot. I suppose right now I'm just kinda shocked he's making a big deal out of it, I just asked him ( and I think pretty politely, i could've said it a lot worse ) not to touch me because it makes me uncomfortable.", "Justify\nArgue\nDefend\nExplain", "Here's the thing - HE DID SOMETHING WRONG.  You have been flinching and giving body language clues at minimum for months that this unwelcome.  Touching without consent is doing something wrong.

Going around to other coworkers and moaning that now he feels bad is manipulative garbage.

Does he actually feel any remorse now that he's realized how uncomfortable he's been making you for months?  Doesn't seem like it.

That's why he's unhappy.", "A friendly mantra that helps me (need to remind myself often)\n\"His emotions are not yours to manage.\"\n\nSo what if he's uncomfortable now, unlike you being uncomfortable with his touching you, you did not DO anything to him. If he's uncomfortable or \"feels like he did something bad,\" that's on him to figure out his own emotions.", ">that doesn't seem like a big deal or big ask to me.\n\nIt isn't. His reaction is purely to make you feel like you're in the wrong for setting extremely reasonable boundaries. You aren't. \n\nThis kind of reaction is a common manipulation tactic. Fuck that dude.\n\nEDIT: Honestly, boundaries you shouldn't have to be setting at all. It shouldn't be default that you're touching people at work. Greasy beggar.", "Thank you - useful acronym I didn't know.", "*Consent* is the key here, OP.\n\nJust stick to that narrative.  He never asked for consent.\n\nAlso, if he doesn't touch any of the men at the site as much or in the same way, you have a slam dunk response for anyone who questions his actions."]}
