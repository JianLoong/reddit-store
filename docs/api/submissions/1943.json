Uninvited physical contact is inappropriate. It doesn't have to be sexual or violent in nature to be inappropriate. Certain relationships have a baseline level of implied consent for casual touch. Workplace relationships are not one of them. When you're in a romantic relationship, it is generally acceptable to not ask consent every time you put your hand on their shoulder/back or nudge their arm because that's standard in a relationship. Some people don't like that and it's on them to set different boundaries, and you are responsible for obtaining consent (and clarifying parameters on continued consent) for anything beyond casual touch.\n\nIn the state where I live, if I tell someone not to touch me and they even just put their hand on my shoulder, they have committed battery and I can press charges.
