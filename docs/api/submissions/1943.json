Uninvited physical contact is inappropriate. It doesn't have to be sexual or violent in nature to be inappropriate. Certain relationships have a baseline level of implied consent for casual touch. Workplace relationships are not one of them. When you're in a romantic relationship, it is generally acceptable to not ask consent every time you put your hand on their shoulder/back or nudge their arm because that's standard in a relationship. Some people don't like that and it's on them to set different boundaries, and you are responsible for obtaining consent (and clarifying parameters on continued consent) for anything beyond casual touch.\n\nIn the state where I live, if I tell someone not to touch me and they even just put their hand on my shoulder, they have committed battery and I can press charges.

Being called on it has him all in an uproar because he knows it can cost him his job. Just the idea of sexual harassment has resulted in whole crews being fired on some jobsites. It's a BIG DEAL on any jobsite.\n When you add in that most jobsites do not have a HR dept to go to, makes it easy for his denials to sweep it under the rug. Go to your foreman and formally complain. Or if you have to, his supervisor. I know you don't want to be THAT person, but you might have to to counter his backpedaling to the rest of the crew. You do not have to put up with this BS.", "He needs to take it personally. It\u2019s personal. He is not a victim of anything here. He is the perpetrator. Stop trying to make him feel better about being creepy.", "\u201cBest to just keep getting harassed\u201d is really only the solution if you\u2019re in very real immediate danger.", "Ignore what katsmeow is saying other than the \"speak up sooner\" part, a person who genuinely didn't realize would just say sorry and not do it again in response to you simply stating your discomfort. People who make a big dramatic public scene afterward are absolutely the assholes. He's pissed that he couldn't take advantage of you being a young woman anymore and is acting unreasonable. \n\nThink about it this way, if the situation were reversed and you were the one making the touches to him, would you be behaving like he is if you made the mistake? Or would you actually act like an adult instead and say sorry and not do it anymore?", "If you've never seen it - he doesn't do it. Men who are genuinely just \"touchy-feely\" are, in fact, like that with everyone and all the time. They give hugs, high-fives, shoulder bumps, what-have-yous, to anybody - men & women. Innocent touchy-feely people that do it for bonding purposes, ask for consent first or try to pay attention to reactions, or at least back off when someone expresses discomfort. \n\nCreepers on the other hand... Pull this kinda stuff. NTA & please follow all the advice you're getting for HR reporting. If not just for you, for the next young woman in that situation.", "talk to your HR about this. this is considered sexual harassment", "But a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit is right now. (You, sueing them) which will make them take action SWIFTLY. Do it. He deserves it. If not for you, for the next woman who works here who will also get called a bitch if she doesnt want to be sexually harassed.", "You\u2019d be surprised at how much your boss can do. Please speak to him about it. If nothing else, it goes on the record and makes it easier for them to act the next time he does this, or if he escalated his behaviour."]}
