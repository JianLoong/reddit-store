But it doesn't go until that point, it is basically anything. We can't go to cfes because she says the smell of coffee and pastries make her sick to her stomach, and that besides that she can't drink coffee wich she used to love.\n\nShe is also in my friends group (I introduced her) and has the same attitude around clothes. We can't go shopping anymore because she will start crying that she can't wear the clothes or that the heels won't fit her.\nWe have told her that there must be clothes with a bigger size to complement her body now but she says that is a waste of energy and money.\n\nSo, In three weeks it will be my 30th birthday so I want to make it special. Since I was a child my best friend's and I favorite food has been sushi (we used to go out to this sushi place once a week) so I found this restaurant who will deliver me these freshly made sushi rolls.\nI have told  SIL today about this so I can warn her about the \"potential nauseating smell\" that she says she hates.\n\nThe moment I told her she got very mad. She told me how selfish I was for choosing the main food that she cannot eat at the moment. I tried to explain to her that I had always planned this and that I will also gather food specifically for her.\n\nBut she did not hear me. She screamed that I was doing this on  purpose just to humiliate her like \"all the other times\". It was there when I got very mad, and screamed back in front of her whole family (we were previously alone, but after hearing her screams people started to come) that she was being a bitch since she found out she got pregnant, and that that was only and excuse to tap how much of a brat she was and that she was prohibited from being near my house the day of my birthday.\n\n\nAfter that I was having none of it and went away leaving her crying (only husband came).\n\n\nAll of this was yesterday, and since then I have not stopped getting messages from hubs fily telling me to apologize because while she may had been behaving very demanding she was pregnant and I shouldn't put through emotions like that and that I was very cruel, especially for the sushi on my birthday thing \n\nMy Husband agrees with me, but I am not sure, maybe I have not been empathetic.

If she puts some under her nose, it'll overwhelm any other smells.

It's your birthday, your preference, and if she doesn't like it she's free to skip. Same goes for clothes shopping or whatever.\n\nSure, when you're doing things as a family or whatever it's fine to adjust to cater to someone with special needs (even if temporary), but that doesn't mean every single thing needs to be about her. But she raised it to the asshole level by screaming at you for not bowing to her needs. Pregnancy hormones are an explanation, but not an excuse for being rotten to others.", "A bit of both. \n\nRegarding food, especially when she\u2019s around, YTA. Smells sometimes have a huge impact on pregnant women, so her asking to avoid them isn\u2019t unreasonable. \n\nRegarding shopping, NTA. In that case, not wanting you to shop with her around is her being an entitled brat.", "No. NTA.", "ESH. \n\nPregnant people have complicated emotions due to hormones, body dysmorphia and not feeling like themselves. It was perfectly reasonable for her to put boundaries in place for what she was or was not willing to do. And sometimes when people are not feeling themselves, we accommodate their otherwise strange requests because we love them. It's not hard to avoid kebabs, sushi, cafes and shopping when you hang out with your pals. \n\nNow that being said, she was a bit of a brat in going in on you for *your* plans for your birthday. She is always free to decline hangouts when something that's around her is not going to work.", ">But I have thought about me being pregnant and I wouldn't behave like that!\n\nYTA - Sushi and Coffee are definitely two things pregnant women try to avoid (not b/c of smell, b/c of the raw fish and the caffeine), so you basically are throwing a dinner party she can't attend.  Also, your SIL is full of raging hormones (which have made this into a \"I don't want you there\" thing).  If you were pregnant, you very well may act just like this.  You aren't the same person.\n\nYou wouldn't act a certain when when you are pregnant, but this is how you act when you are not pregnant (and 30)?\n\n>It was there when I got very mad, and screamed back in front of her whole family (we were previously alone, but after hearing her screams people started to come) that she was being a bitch since she found out she got pregnant, and that that was only and excuse to tap how much of a brat she was and that she was prohibited from being near my house the day of my birthday.\n\nYou can do whatever you want for your birthday, but it seems like you are deliberately excluding her (out of annoyance, not thoughtfulness) and she is full of hormones that are making her way more sensitive than she normally would be.  I don't know what your issue is.  Have you never met a pregnant lady before?", "ESH you're both acting ridiculous. You are being petty and it's not easy having to avoid food you love, but she's also overreacting.", "Nta. She just stay home", "NTA - your birthday is about you, not her.  It's fair to make accommodations, but she wants EVERYTHING to be about her.", "ESH. \n\nSIL has no grounds for being irritated at you getting sushi for your birthday, much less irate, and she should simply politely bow out of shopping trips for clothes if she can\u2019t handle the emotions they create right now. It\u2019s reasonable to an extent for family to gather at a restaurant the pregnant person can handle. Pregnancy doesn\u2019t last forever.\n\nOP is an AH for screaming and name calling. You\u2019re an adult. These are responses to conflict that would earn my 6 year old consequences. An adult should be able to handle it better.", "NTA being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean having a by pass to be a b&@\u20ac! Enough of excusing those attitude !", "NTA, pregnancy isn't an excuse for shitty behavior. Is it understandable why she can't have sushi? yes. Does it mean she can dictate how you celebrate your birthday especially when you had plans to accommodate her? Absolutly not, why is your husband siding with her when he agrees with you?", "ESH SIL because she trys to dictate, what you can do for your birthday and you for screaming. There could have been a better way to handle that.\nAnd by the way, i ate sushi while pregnant. There are many sorts without fish or even with fried fish/shrimps.\nBut she really sounds annoying, with all her demands.", "YTA - Pregnant women have hormones going haywire and one of the symptoms is severe nausea at certain smells. There was a story on here a while ago about a woman who\u2019s husband drank every night but the smell of alcohol always made her vomit, and she could still smell it on him even after he brushed his teeth. She wasn\u2019t making it up, it\u2019s just that the hormones can make pregnant women have an almost superhuman sense of smell. \n\nYou need to apologize for calling her names. Try to compromise with her - it\u2019s your birthday and you can choose to go wherever you want. Maybe you can meet up with her another day?", "I had hyperemesis for all 4 of my pregnancies. My diet and what was good was limited.  Even so, the extent of my \u201crules\u201d were NO ONE shared my french fries.  DO NOT STEAL A SINGLE FRY and my husband couldn\u2019t have hot peppers on his subs\u2026some of the time.  He checked with me, on a good seat I could tolerate the odor.  \n\nI was hospitalized for hyperemesis and I learned to manage it after that.  It was work. If someone\u2019s birthday treat was a restaurant specializing in coffee and hot peppers, a place I *could not* have safely gone to, I would encourage them to go, wished them happy birthday, and **pleasantly** said I would stay home, because who wants to ruin someone\u2019s birthday???\n\nTell them to knock it off, she can be a reasonable adult and go and eat something cooked, or not go and recognize that this is temporary and you get to celebrate your round number birthday even if she is pregnant.  NTA", "But sil is taking it out on op and others. And not once or twice, but several times", "NTA. Been pregnant 4 times and never demanded people for ANYTHING. She doesn't seem to want anyone to enjoy what they like and it must all cater to her. Um, no thank you. She can get her own food if she doesn't like sushi. It's your freaking birthday.", "NTA.  \n\nPregnant women definitely experience smell issues, my best friend from college's wife, who had loved coffee beforehand, could no longer come to coffee with us because the smell nauseated her.  \n\nBut expecting you to plan your own birthday celebration around her preferences and blowing up when you don't is obviously self centered to the point of toxic - sounds like she's playing all this up for maximum effect.  Good luck at the holidays this year, I'm guessing this behavior doesn't improve.", "NTA you were right in how you reacted and your SIL is being pretty rude.", "NTA. I'm pregnant right now, and sure things make me feel sick sometimes. I'm also allergic to shellfish, but if my husband wanted sushi for his birthday, I'd be the first to pay for it. I also don't use pregnancy as an excuse to be a b***h.", "NTA. I was pregnant and didn\u2019t make anyone accommodate me in any way.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to organize whatever birthday catering you like and she\u2019s free to not go, eat cooked sushi (plenty of safe for pregnancy options at most sushi places), or bring alternative food for herself. She was being unreasonably demanding but you didn\u2019t need to scream at her or name call.", "nta", "ESH you all sound exhausting. Your SIL is obviously out of bounds. She doesn\u2019t get to decide things on your birthday. If it\u2019s just a regular day out it\u2019s considerate to avoid places with string smells. Stop inviting her to things if she\u2019s going to try and dictate everything. \n\nYou instead of talking to her about it calmly waited until you were ready to blow and did. Much better ways to go about this.", "ESH. One pregnant and brat, one brat.", "Don\u2019t invite her!!

I would never tell someone they cant continue their tradition for their birthday of getting sushi. I would tell them have fun and send me pictures of their outfits. All i could eat was french fries for months with my first and still wouldn\u2019t dictate where my family ate for a family dinner. \n\nI still went shopping with my sister and i just chose not to try things on. One energy wise and two I knew I wasnt gonna wear for long. I always encourage her on try stuff on and shopping. \n\nIt sounds like your sil is having a hard time with her body changing and her nausea. She needs to work on that however she cant expect everyone to cater to her for everything. \n\nYou suck for yelling and name calling. That never helps any situation.", "NTA\n\nUninvite her asap.

Your birthday, not hers.", "ESH Sounds like you blew up at the last straw and you both acted hurtfully to each other.", "NTA.  I understand some accommodations from time to time, but it's ridiculous for her to expect you to center your own birthday plans around her preferences.  You're not even married to her.  If she doesn't like being around people while she's pregnant, then she should simply stay away instead of forcing everyone to walk on eggshells around her.  \"The smell of sushi nauseates me right now, so I can't make it to your party this year.  Enjoy your birthday!\"  That's all she had to say.", "ESH. You can make sure she has a sandwich or something to eat and she shouldn't be forcing all of her restrictions on everyone else.", "NTA. The family dinner thing makes sense. Yes, foods really can bother pregnant women, even the smells. However, you shouldn't have to cater to her clothes shopping and your birthday dinner. If those things bother her, then she can skip it.

I get that she's your SIL but she's been a pain in the ass for 4 months. Have YOUR day be about you because it's clear that the rest of the year has to be about her until she pops that baby out. \n\nFor the love of god, I swear some women just become possessed when pregnant. And yes, there's hormones changes involved but I swear some of the stories here are more Dr Jekyll& Mrs Hyde.", "NTA...she is weaponizing her pregnancy.  I have been pregnant a lot, hormones do not make you rude or entitled.  Honestly, I am tired of the pregnancy excuse for being a crappy person.", "She can eat sushi if the fish/protein is cooked or if it\u2019s vegetarian sushi.", "ESH. Pregnancy nausea is no joke. You may think you'll definitely be more flexible when you're pregnant, but that's not really up to you so much as it is to your hormones. I realize you thought you were being nice to offer SIL a heads-up about the smell at the party, but knowing in advance that it'll be there won't make her less sick. It just means she probably can't come. \n\nIt's her right not to come, and it's your right to have sushi, but neither of you need to be in a screaming match right now about who is the more spoiled. Adults should act better than this. C'mon.", "Double AH", "Why are you feeling obligated to do everything with her when she's clearly not up to it? I don't understand this at all.", "NTA at all and yea yea hormones and emotions cz pregnant but that doesnt give someone free reign to be an insufferable jerk. If she cant stand the smell of coffee or sushi(which is understandable) then she just doesnt get to come, if she cant stand shopping because it will make her cry then she doesnt come thats it and thats all although there are super cute maternity clothes now and she could baby shop but whatever if she doesnt want to shop. Its your birthday and you should do whatever it is that you want to do and if she doesnt come owell shouldnt be any hard feelings on either side.", "ESH.  You're right that she's being a bit bratty, but, why even invite her to that event? She can't eat the food and the smell will make her barf. \n\nI can see how it seemed like you were rubbing it in. Ha ha, I'm having a fun party and you can't participate.", "YTA First if all, screaming and insulting a pregnant woman over her dietary preferences is offensive and uncalled for.

More info here: https://www.healthline.com/health/pregnancy/can-pregnant-women-eat-sushi#why-to-avoid-it\n\nEdit to add that surely you can either compromise on what\u2019s served or have sushi with friends at a gathering without your SIL, and get together with her for some other meal at a different time.", "NTA  \nI had horrible morning sickness the first 5 months of my pregnancy, many foods triggered me.  I didn't expect anything from anyone, I just removed myself from situations that made me ill.  It's your birthday, eat what you like.  Your SIL is over the top expecting everyone to change their life for her, she's not the first pregnant person in the world.  Your delivery could have been kinder, next time don't bottle up your feelings this long.", "NTA. She sounds like an entitled nightmare. Well done on standing up for yourself", "NTA at all but maybe check in with her to see how she is doing emotionally, she might be worried or anxious about the pregnancy and how her life will  change soon and being a jerk is how its manifesting itself on the outside. Or she might just be a jerk!", "You\u2019d behave like that, some of it anyway. She\u2019s not being dramatic about the food smells, she really can\u2019t tolerate them right now. If she\u2019s to be included, that means having food she can be in the same room with.", "ESH.  All the things you mention are normal for pregnant women and you have not been very empathetic at all.  Their heightened sense of smell can turn them into throw up machines at worst and nauseated at best.  It's not her fault, that is literally what pregnancy does to someone and they have zero control over what smells negatively affect them, which ones do not, and that can change in a moment.  You do not seem very sympathetic or willing to go where she might be able to stand the smell and eat.  She also can't eat certain things as recommended by her doctor, such as caffeine and sushi.  She is dealing with a ton of body changes in a short period of time and is probably wondering what she will look like after baby, making her feel insecure so shopping for clothes like you used to do just heightens that insecurity.  Of course she feels like it is a waste of money to buy clothes she may or may not fit in after pregnancy and they may not look good on her even if they fit.  You seem to be stuck in the past.   \nHer reality now is body changes, sensitivity to smell, and being unable to eat things she used to eat which you seem unable to accept.  While she should not have demanded you do something else for your birthday, you knowing she can't tolerate the smell should have approached it and said, I understand if you won't come, but I planned this before your pregnancy. You have no idea how you will behave if you are sick from smells constantly when you are pregnant.  You have no idea how you will act when you have an unsympathetic sibling that insists on behaving like you aren't pregnant when you cannot.", "NTA\n\nYou offered accommodations for her pregnancy & she still got mad. That's on her. And pregnancy is no excuse for rudeness", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to eat whatever you want to eat on your birthday.   You don't even share the same living space, so I have no idea why that'd be an issue.\n\nINFO: Was her behavior at all like this before she became pregnant, or is this a complete change of personality?", "YTA. You gave your family the choice of vomiting or not attending your birthday - basically no choice at all. When I have a birthday dinner with my family, I pick a restaurant / food that accommodates everyone. My family doesn\u2019t like certain types of ethnic foods, and I have family members that also get nauseated by certain food smells, so I avoid those types of restaurants so that all attendees can enjoy themselves.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Oof. No sympathy. No empathy. No desire to change plans (which she doesn't have to, it's her bday - but going ahead with plans that purposely exclude someone in your friend group is still a dick move no matter what the reason is - in the case of pregnancy it's discrimination since it's very clear she didn't want SIL there - again, not obligated to invite her, but given OP's attitude it's a dick move).

SIL is just enjoying being an AH.", "Is mostly husband's family wich he hasn't seen in a long time so he feels he want to make up the time lost. I enjoying going out so I never bothered. Is only the last months when SIL found out she was pregnant.\n\nIf you refer to the friends, you can get better knolegde trough my comments.", ">why even invite her to that event?\n\nImagine if she found out she wasn't invited. Not sure if I can blame it all on the hormones but that sure would cause drama. \n\nPick your poison as they say.", "I moved back to our home city six months ago, originally it was going to be only my family (husband include)  and best friends.", "Its her birthday and she wants sushi so she can have it its not about SIL! Also she said she would get her her own food but was warning her because the smell of sushi makes her sick. Also the pregnant lady was screaming at her first so she yelled back. Being pregnant does not give you the right to treat others like shit and be a demanding asshole which the SIL clearly is and if she doesnt want to be around sushi then guess what she doesnt have to come but she doesnt get to dictate the lives of others because is having a baby.", "While I agree with the first part, no one is forcing the SIL to join or eat any sushi. And the reason sushi is bad is because certain fish have high mercury content and it is actually safe for pregnant people to eat some types of sushi in moderation. And even if op is an AH, so is the SIL, just because your pregnant does not mean everyone you know has to plan around you to accommodate you.", "OP seems seems to be operating in the present. OP still has a life outside this pregnancy/baby, sucks that SIL is having a tough time but guess what? That\u2019s SIL\u2019s problem. OP\u2019s 30th should be about OP, not about a baby that isn\u2019t born yet or a full grown adult throwing a hissy fit.", "But she can wait right? Besides, is my birthday and I get to decide, especially on something that I have wanted for a long time.\n \n\nShopping is usually one of the excuses friends and I used to have to gather together (SIL joined the group after).\nWe never made her feel inadequate, is okay that her body is growing, a human being is developing after all and that's something that will happen to me one day too. \n\nWe told her that we can go shopping for clothes to prepare for the next months but she is flat out refused. \n\nIt  wouldn't bother me that much if she then left my friends and I also go out, but once she knew about a getaway of my group from a friend of her who's saw us and then wrote to us that she would \"prefer if we don't do that anymore\".", "I agree with ESH, but it's only raw sushi that pregnant women should avoid. I personally have never been to a sushi restaurant that didn't have cooked rolls too. I'm 18 weeks pregnant and I've had my favorite cooked rolls twice during this pregnancy. I wouldn't demand we not go a specific restaurant because there are a handful of things on the menu that I can't eat while there are also things I can eat. Also, the current guidelines for caffeine suggest limiting intake to less than 200mg per day, it's not like alcohol.", "Nobody is forcing SIL to eat it. OP can get a few things that SIL can eat or just choose not to invite her (I am leaning towards the latter because SIL will try to make the party about her).", "Everyone sucks here", ">You can do whatever you want for your birthday\n\nRight, but the fact she goes around to her and tells her she won't want to come b/c of sushi... idk... I can see why SIL thinks she's saying \"I got sushi b/c I don't want you there\" not \"I love sushi, but we can do something else\"", "I would have had a separate event with her. Had two birthday meals. A win all round.", "She hasn't, she's shown jealousy mostly. \"Source food for her\" okay, how? Just don't invite her.", "I was of the impression that the sushi was a friends group thing. \n\n*\"my best friend's and I favorite food has been sushi (we used to go out to this sushi place once a week) so I found this restaurant who will deliver me these freshly made sushi rolls.\"*", "Sounds like they have been incredibly accommodating up to this point.  Other people get to celebrate their own life events as they want.  OP presumably didn't make anyone in this story pregnant and has no responsibility to change their plans to accommodate someone else on their birthday.  Especially when it wipes out their entire favorite type of food.", "Go to Japan. I guarantee you pregnant women there eat sushi. \nNot to mention you can get rolls with no raw ingredients.", "So why not do sushi with just the friends and something else with family? \n\nShe literally can't go to this event unless your other guests are all cool with getting barfed on.", "It\u2019s not just mercury. Raw fish can have bacteria that are potentially harmful to pregnant women. Look at the link I posted. I do agree that the SIL also behaved poorly and in retrospect my judgement should have been ESH.", "As long as you guys aren't excluding her each time you go out, then NTA. \n\nShe literally cannot eat some of the things you guys like. So she's not TA for listening to medical advice. However, she doesn't get to demand that everyone else change and cater things for her. Pregnancy does not mean the world revolves around you. \n\nHowever, YWBTA if you guys are constantly doing things she cannot join on. So as long as you guys are still making plans to hang out with her and eat the foods that she likes, so that she still feels like a valued member of the friend group, then she doesn't get to demand that you \"don't do that anymore\". Not everyone can and should be part of every plan. You could have sushi with your friends at your house for your birthday, and go out to a SIL-appropriate restaurant with her on a separate day. \n\nHowever, I do wonder if there is something else to the story, since she screamed \"like all the other times\" -- what was she talking about there?", "got it, thank you", "Good for you for catering entitlement?, OP is not you and she doesn't have to cater anyone but herself on her birthday.", "Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s even more hurtful to exclude a family member/member of her friend group?\n\nAnd what jealousy???", "Either way, she\u2019s free to exclude her SIL, but expecting her not to feel bad about it is a bit much. Of course she\u2019s going to feel that the choice of meal is more important than her company is. If it is, okay, but expect the backlash.", "Op doesn\u2019t have to plan her birthday around her husbands pregnant sister. Yes it would be nice but chances are op and her husband would end up forking up a higher bill to accommodate 1 person for Ops bday. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t mean you get to have a say and control what others do any day of the week but especially not someone else\u2019s birthday. Being pregnant means you don\u2019t get to everything you can do when you\u2019re not and that does include not being able to join every social outing that happens. This isn\u2019t a family celebration op is having but one with her friends and while op seems to have some grudge against SIL, it still doesn\u2019t make op an AH for not planning their day around someone else.", "Okay invite a pregnant woman to a sushi place lmao. You're just as petty as OP then :)", "I don\u2019t eat sushi and I\u2019ve been to a ton of dinners at sushi restaurants. Order something else.", "You\u2019re comparing things that aren\u2019t the same. It\u2019s different when you\u2019re pregnant. She\u2019s not making it up. There are food smells she can\u2019t tolerate right now."]}
