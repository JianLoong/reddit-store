With 4 bodies in the small space it gets very hot, I admit that it is uncomfortably warm.  \n\n\nRather than wear lightweight house clothes they insist on wearing their underwear when we\u2019re all in the apartment. Small tight boxers and little lacy/mesh bra and panties. At night they will sleep in my living room completely naked and do not even try to cover up when I have to pass through the living room in the morning on the way to the bathroom to get ready for work. I even make sure to communicate to them PRECISELY what time I will be coming in the room so they can set an alarm and be aware of when they need to cover up.  \n\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has confronted them several times about this and each time they scoff and ask when we became \u201cso puritan\u201d. Even when it\u2019s not unbearably hot they do this (It\u2019s happened at least 4 times previously in spring and even winter so it's not just a temperature thing!) and I am getting increasingly frustrated with their lack of respect in my own home.  \n\n\nI\u2019ve been terse with them this weekend because I am fed up with this behaviour and because my mother-in-law made a disparaging comment about my weight.

I worry that she is right and I am the asshole. Maybe I\u2019m just being prude but also in this instance it was very very warm so maybe I should let it slide?

If they have plenty of money, why are they sleeping in your living room instead of a nice hotel? If you don't have air conditioning in your apartment, they should be paying for TWO hotel rooms for the duration of the heatwave. Then everyone could enjoy their visit a lot more.

How much longer are they meant to be there? For convenience sake, I would suggest letting this visit play out and then limiting future visits to non overnights.

It's your home, too, and they should respect your request them wear clothes. Just because their nuclear family is fine with this behavior doesn't mean you have to be, and your husband should be on your side. You deserve to be comfortable in your home and absolutely do not stay somewhere else when they visit -- if you do that, they win, they've scared you off. \n\nIt'd be tempting to do something that makes them uncomfortable, but it's just you being you in your home. Working out in the living room while they sleep. Making out / being affectionate with your husband in front of them. Have a personal conversation of you own with your friends and family about your in-laws terrible behavior.", "Your house, your rules. If they don\u2019t comply, they\u2019re not welcome.

My cousin used to walk around my house the same way, in front of my \u0125uaband. So I completely feel where you've coming from.

Yes, some cultures/traditions don't involve objections to nudity, but you aren't from one of those and it's your place.\n\nIf you're the leaseholder, what would any written agreement you may have happen to state about number of guests, lengths of visits, freelance strip shows, etc.? Are there any local ordinances which may be relevant? It'd be important to abide by the laws, but sign the three of them up for a cheap hotel and have movers take their stuff there, change the locks, and be glad if you haven't actually married into that.", "Maybe with all the heat your air conditioning might  stop working and it would be too uncomfortable for anyone to study in your  apartment.

Society is. \nUltimately nudity is natural, we're born naked and should be allowed to just be naked whenever we want (in non sexual ways of course). It's society that shames and sexualises our bodies. For no good reason I might add. \nEveryone should have the right to choose how much or little they wear. I get your house etc, but people shouldn't be shamed because they're conformable in their natural state.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You've already had several conversations to try and remedy the situation, it's time for consequences.\n\nA key warning here is to not sacrifice the sanctity of your home for another's pleasure.

Hangovers or long nights)"]}
