My SIL and her husband have two kids, 5 and 7, who are extremely spoiled, overstimulated, undisciplined kids. The type to turn your house upside down, break things, don't sit down, don't say please and thank you.  When my SIL was pregnant with her first child about 8 years ago, she wanted my MIL to move in with her (she was newly retired, living alone but completely able bodied and independent) and my MIL happily agreed. My BIL is absolutely useless, a hands off, lazy guy that thinks his job as a husband/dad stops at earning money to provide for his family (my SIL also works full time). My SIL and I had some issues many years back over her general sense of entitlement but we are good now, not BFFs, but fine.\r Over the last 8 years, my MIL's health has declined, she is now 75 years old. Not only does she help my SIL raise her kids, she cooks all the meals, cleans, does all the laundry. My husband takes my MIL to all of her doctor's appointments, and assists her financially when needed so it is not like we are hands off in that regard.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where the problem begins-\r  \n\r  \nMy SIL and MIL have now started to clash and neither of them are happy living together. My SIL is wanting my husband and I to take her in. My MIL can no longer live alone or drive so that is not an option as she really needs assistance getting around. I have no problem taking her in, we aren't the best of friends but it's my husband's mother and no matter what, I respect that. But my MIL is a hoarder and we have very different ways of living. I am not my SIL, I cook, I clean, I run my own house so my MIL will have to respect that. Also, I refuse to have my home look like an episode of Hoarders. \r  \n\r  \nSecond issue- my SIL still needs help with the kids because no one will be home for them when they get home from school, this was my MIL's job. My SIL wants the kids to change bus routes and be dropped off at my house so my MIL can take care of them until she gets home from work. I work full time from home--I cannot have those kids in my house when I'm on calls literally 75% of the work day. Not to mention what will happen come summer vacation....\r  \n\r  \nAITA for:\r  \n1. Telling my MIL she will have to adhere to my rules as a wife, woman of the house.\r  \n2. Mentioning that my SIL's kids are not allowed here during my working hours and/or daily during summer vacation. My home should not be an extension of my SIL's home just because we live close by. \r  \n3. Just being generally pissed off that it's come to this. My SIL doesn't realize how good she has had it with years of having the live in help and is completely ignorant of how her spoiled nature has broken my MIL's body down. Also, she still wants to reap the benefits of having her mother help her with the kids but now putting the burden of her on my husband and I.\r  \n\r  \nFor the record, my husband and I are 100% completely on the same page about everything.", "created_utc": 1703094855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n0o5w/aita_for_setting_strong_boundaries_with_inlaws/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But... good luck.  I really don't think these are going to hold.  They're going to sneak those kids in your house the first chance they get.", "NTA", ">But my MIL is a hoarder\n\nOof. Yeah. Mine was too. It was 100% no go for living with us because of this single issue. She was a delightful person but the way she lived oozed out of her pours into every inch of living space and it was just...gross. No way that was coming into my house, husband fortunately was even more adamant about that than I was.\n\nNTA. At all. Your house, your rules.", "NTA. Your home is your work place and, for your type of work, children have no business there. Even if that weren't the case they have no right to volunteer your home to babysit those kids.", "NTA But\n\nYour husband and you are on the same page and this is HIS family. Have him handle things, following what the two of you agreed on. There is no reason to stress yourself when he should be taking it.", "NTA\n\n  \nTaking your MIL in would be incredibly generous. Most wouldn't do it, after she helped SIL, shje should stay there.\n\n  \nBut THIS \"My SIL wants the kids to change bus routes and be dropped off at my house so my MIL can take care of them until she gets home from work\"  is COMPLETELY Ridiculous. Either MIL is fit enough to do childcare - then she should do it a SIL's house. ANd if she can't,  SIL's will have to find someone else. YOU taking care of MIL AND SIL'S kids is a ridicuolous idea. Make it a HARD NO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo make a ruel: IF MIL wants to see the kids, SIL has to pick her up. And the kids can visit only as long as they are accompagnied by a parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut: In reality, you should let MIL stay with SIL. SHE got the benefit, SHE shopuld do the work. MIL chose to live with SIL, there is NO need for you to let her change that just because SIL wants to get rid of her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnD: MIL moving in with you will mean that you either give up your job or hire a caretaker.", "NTA.  Your conditions are more than reasonable.  I wouldn't put it past SIL to try to have the kids dropped off at your house anyway though so be prepared for that.", "No no no. \nYour SIL needs to find her own childcare. \nYou are NOT FREE to do it.  You work from home and need an absolutely quiet house. \nSo No to SIL. \n\nShe either keeps MIL at her place, or she gets her own childcare. You are NOT available, and neither is MIL while in your home. \n\nRegarding MIL, have a serious discussion with your hubby. \n\nSHOW HIM THIS POST. \nYou will not live with a hoarder. \nShe either comes without all of her possessions/stuff, and lives a minimalist lifestyle or she can\u2019t come. \nOr you will be tossing her things behind her back and will not be apologizing for it.", "SIL you\u2019ve had an unpaid babysitter, housekeeper, cleaner for years. Time to pay for childcare and someone to take care of your mom.", "NTA - but even if you do set these boundaries, expect them to be tested and bent and broken.\n\nFind a backup plan for where MIL might go that doesn't involve your house, and have that as the 'alternate plan' that you can present, and have it something that can actually be put into play if you do take her in, and when the rules are broken.  \n\nMy brother was a hoarder - well, not quite, but it did take 6 trucks from 1-800 got junk to clean out his 2 bedroom apartment after he passed away.  I understand that a bit, and that's a psychological problem.  If she does move in, set the bar very high for maintenance of the space she moves into.  Anything else will result in a quick cascade to disaster.", "NTA. Boundaries are incredibly important and often times people don't stick to thrm to placate certain people who are pushy. It's great your husband and you are in agreement. Just stick to them and don't back down. It sounds like they're fight back but don't budge an inch. Bravo OP", "NTA.\n\nDo not do it. As you said, it's not just the MIL, it's the baggage (niece/nephew) that comes with it.\n\nOn the MIL moving in thing alone, if you allow your MIL to move in, you will be in a constant battle to maintain your household.  Hoarding is an insidious disease.\n\nSecond, SIL will constantly be at you to allow the kids to come to your house.  \n\n\nETA: In other words, it won't just be a \"one and done\" regarding setting your boundaries.  You'll have to field tons of complaints, requests, demands, etc. ... probably daily.", "NTA.  The answer should be NO!  Not one of them will do you the respect of living up to whatever agreement you make.", "Hoarding is a psychological problem. Telling her she can't do it will work as well as tears on a house fire. I'm sorry but I would not consider any of this. The kids WILL end up at your house. They WILL all disrespect your boundaries. They've spent years proving to you who they are. Believe them. Find another solution for your MIL as living with you is a recipe for disaster. NTA", "Good for you for laying down some rules. And it\u2019s so good that you and your husband are on the same page. \n\nYou know there is going to be pushback. And if your MIL gives you too much resistance, you can remind her that there are assisted living homes she could move into-and you will be looking into it, if she doesn\u2019t go with the program.\n\nAnd your SIL and her rampaging horde of two- they will have to figure something out that doesn\u2019t depend- in any way - on *you*. Sucks for them. But they are not your problem. NTA", "NTA but you would be CRAZY to have MIL move in. It will make you & your husband miserable. Your SIL will dump her kids on you every chance she gets. Contact a social worker & figure out what the senior housing options are in your area.", "NTA, just say no to all of it.", "NTA -  I have seen this happen before.  One sibling has parent live with them when parent is younger, more active, but then wants to dump parent off when they get older.  You cannot equate taking care of parent when they get oldeer", "NTA\n\nBut FFS\n\n>  I have no problem taking her in\n\nYes. You do. Several problems. And this post is a list of them.\n\nHer retirement is not your nor your husband's responsibility. Full stop.", ">my SIL still needs help with the kids because no one will be home for them when they get home from school, this was my MIL's job.\n\nSounds like she needs to make up with MIL then.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
