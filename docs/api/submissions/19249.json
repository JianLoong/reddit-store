The moment anyone throws out the \u201cIf you love me\u2026..\u201d line I\u2019m automatically going the opposite direction.  I hate that.  It is pure manipulation and I won\u2019t put up with it for one moment.  At that point we would either be leaving for home or I would be going out to enjoy my vacation.  \n\n\u201cIf you love me, you won\u2019t ruin my vacation because you think you\u2019re too fat.\u201d\u2026..That works both ways, but obviously you wouldn\u2019t say that.", "NTA. Her feeling bad about herself is valid, but she should not have insisted you stay in the room with her at all times or been such a downer the whole time. If you were acting in love and like you're proud to be seen with her at the beach, I wish she could have had a little confidence. But maybe you weren't since you make comments like I love her, but.. and she had six months but didn't do anything", "NTA When she said \"if you loved me you wouldn't complain\" I knew she's the AH. That is very manipulative.", "NTA- while feeling like crap about yourself is a valid thing to experience, her forcing you to stop your vacation because of her insecurity is not cool. \n\nWhile bringing up she had time to lose weight would probably sting and only make her feel more shitty, I can understand where you are coming from. I agree with other commenters that she really needs someone to push (lovingly and calmly) for her to go to therapy and figure out the root of her insecurity. Then I\u2019d say just working on making sure she feels beautiful and attractive TO YOU. If she really cares about what strangers think over what you think then I think that speaks volumes to her mindset and priorities. \n\nAs someone who has also struggled with self image there comes a time when you either have to go all in on lifestyle changes to feel better about yourself, or mentally come to terms with your body and learn to love it. The best option is somewhere in the middle. Where you stop hating yourself as much but also do what you can to take better care of your body. She really needs to find this medium, and I hope it\u2019s something she can gain through therapy and self reflection and support from those closest to her.\n\nOverall it seems she really manipulated you here. And if she\u2019s unwilling to genuinely apologize or acknowledge this, I\u2019d consider if you really see a future with this person.", "NTA. She should not have agreed to a beach trip if she is that self conscious about her weight. Extra AH points for using the 'if you loved me' line.", "NTA\n\nShe is ridiculous and controlling.\n\nThat is one of the most selfish things ive ever read.  The only thing preventing her from going to the beach is her own mind.  The fact that she selfishly wanted to prevent you from leaving the room is bizarre.  And the way she informed you by saying \" and \" oh by the way, you aren't leaving either\" rather than discuss with you is disrespectful, uncaring towards you, and extremely controlling.  Quite honestly, seems.like she has some sort of mental or emotional problem that she needs professional help for to know a vacation is coming up for 6 mo, then go on vacation and refuse to leave the room.  \n\nThats's some crazy behavior.", "NTA.  That said, if you aren't already, tell her you will never love her less if she never loses another pound.  Then, in the nicest way possible, recommend your wife see a therapist and possibly a dietician.  I say this as a \"just fat\" person.  Fix your head, move your body.  Dieting will make you crazy.", "NTA. Easy NTA.", "NTA she sounds like she's got some serious anxiety and that's valid but it isn't valid to force you to miss out on things because she's feeling anxious, either. The if you loved me you'd stay thing is especially not ok. \n\nHer anxiety isn't her fault, but the way she treats you because of it is. She needs to see a professional about it.", "Nta. Your wife knew how she felt about her weight before you arrived at your destination. I\u2019d be outraged if I went on vacation with someone who expected me to stay cooped up in the hotel room. Your wife is being unreasonable. She could\u2019ve literally wore any outfit to the beach if she felt uncomfortable in swimwear.", "You will probably catch hell. I'm going to say NTA. It's like you said, you both knew about this trip for 6 months. She could've gone pedal to the metal and gotten into some sort of beach-ready shape. She didn't and she punished you. Is she obese?", "NTA. She can feel however she wants about herself, but the second she tried to ruin the trip for you, she became an asshole.", "NTA, but even if she's overweight, I don't think it's the core of the issue, Ive seen too many 200 kilo people on the beach to think the weight itself causes the issue, she need confidence in herself. If you can treat that, you'll probably get her onto the beach, and as an added bonus, she'll probably end up losing the weight as a by product.", "NTA.  She shouldn't have agreed to a beach vacation if she didn't feel comfortable in a suit.", "NTA - that\u2019s crazy.  She knew what she looked like before the trip and if she felt so upset, she could have said something before you got there.  And for her to insist that you weren\u2019t allowed to leave the room because she felt badly about how she looked?! \n\nI wish all of the ESH people would flip this around gender wise and see how you\u2019d react.  If a man suddenly decides he felt too scrawny or too portly to wear a bathing suit on the beach - and refused to wear anything else - and then refused to allow his wife to leave the hotel room because he felt ugly for the entire vacation, I suspect most people would be calling him abusive and controlling.", "NTA. I would say I can't believe people are blaming you, but we all know why.\n\nShe had 6 months to get comfortable. She wasn't able to and that's ok. What isn't ok is her turning it around and trying to stop you from doing things and then emotionally blackmailing you.\n\nIf she truly feels this way, she needs professional help. Dumping all her issues onto you is extremely manipulative", "It\u2019s a trip, you are never gonna see these people again, put the suit on and have fun. If you feel like shit , you had time to do something. You ruined the whole trip with your attitude. Husband is not an asshole..", "NTA This is the rest of your life if you stick around.", "Trauma is the root of addiction, and she\u2019s addicted \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f she needs therapy not a diet", "NTA", "NTA.  \n\nYou said your wife does NOT have a medical issue causing weight gain and, had months to prepare for the trip.\n\nYour wife dropped the ball and, remember, misery *loves*  company.\n\nYou shouldn't be punished for your wifes insecurity.", "ESH - She let her issues/insecurities ruin the vacation for both of you. That sucks. \"You had six months to get in shape\" Also sucks. That was never going to help her get out of her head and it was only going to hurt her. You knew that. You said it because you were mad. I'm sure she didn't want to ruin the vacation. \n\nI'd ask her to look into therapy for her insecurities. Plenty of fat people go to the beach and live their best life. I'm fat, I put on a swimsuit every day and go to the pool with my toddler. This isn't just about being fat. Insecurities like this will not be fixed with weight loss and I'd be worried about dieting triggering a potential eating disorder given how insecure she feels in her body. I know so many women who lost the weight and still weren't happy when they got there.", "ESH. Her worse than you by far, but you could have tried reassuring her that she looked fine in a one piece or whatever she fit into instead of telling her she should have taken the last 6 months to get into shape.\n\nShe needs therapy and should consider asking a doctor for help with nutrition and responsible dieting and exercise.", "I can't decide if this is 'no assholes here' or 'everyone sucks here'. Mostly, I suspect this is the sort of problem that ought to have been solved before anyone got on the plane. \n\nWhy on earth were you going on a beach vacation? \n\nI read this and I don't think, \"Gosh it would be great if the wife spent six whole months desperately amping up her gym schedule so she could spend a week relaxing,\" because what's the point of a vacation if it ruins half your year? Exercise because you like to exercise; exercising in order to look good in a bathing suit is a fool's game. \n\nWho suggested this vacation? Is there a destination the wife \\*would\\* have enjoyed? is there a destination \\*both of you\\* would have enjoyed? Has the wife ever liked a beach vacation? I'm baffled.", "Esh - you are for the way you talk about her and thinking weight is only related to PCOS or thyroid issues. There's also genetics, mental health issues, etc. She is for agreeing to a beach vacation and not letting you go out by yourself.", "I think your wife may not have ruined the vacation for everyone - sometimes it's hard for all of us to relax when we're stressed and anxious, especially if our mental health isn't in a good place. It's understandable that she wouldn't be in the best state of mind to enjoy the trip, so I think it was unfair of you to criticize her for it. Maybe try to find ways of helping her cope with the stress next time.", "Tempted to say ESH, although I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve given us enough info to make a good call. \n\nLike, yeah, assuming you\u2019ve given an accurate rendition of things, your GF is being passive-aggressive and manipulative by telling you that you can\u2019t leave the room, either. Sure. \n\nBut how the hell did you guys (both adults) plan this vacation six months ago and not expect her self-image issues to pop up when it came to hanging out in places that require or expect a bathing suit? You knew it was a beach trip, claim to love her, and yet you sound incredibly unsupportive and uneducated about fatphobia and how it affects people (particularly women) who struggle with their weight.** Did you not think to reassure her, or did you do so but are just not mentioning it here?\n\nWhat makes me think we need more info is that I notice that you mention her age but not yours - are you older and chose/paid for this vacation without her input? Are you the same age as your GF and are just claiming ignorance that she would encounter this issue? Or are you younger than her and have to take advtange of a shared vacation because of having worse job benefits and therefore had no choice in the matter?  \n\nHonestly this hot mess sounds like you\u2019re a sugar daddy, pissed because his hottie girlfriend felt insecure for having a roll on her tummy. If you\u2019re not, right on, but if you are - gtfo, we all have bigger problems to deal with. YTA even if ESH. \n\n**\u201cIt\u2019s all her diet\u201d is rarely true, jsyk: two people can eat the exact same diet but have radically different body shapes. If your GF has struggled with her weight for her /entire/ life, I suspect there\u2019s more than just \u201ceating bad food\u201d to it. Additionally, telling her that she \u201cjust could have dieted\u201d is bad advice at best and actively cruel in my eyes. Google some facts about the efficacy of the yo-yo effect of diets and human base weights.", "The thing that jumped out at me from your post was \"Obviously I love her\"\n\nWho are you trying to convince?\n\nYou're not happy with her weight, she's not happy with her weight. Go on a holiday to push all those insecurities & frictions to the max.\n You both seem to be trying to start arguments...\n\nCounselling or give up.\nESH", "Okay ESH. It wasn't fair of her to make you feel guilty for wanting to do certain activities she's too insecure for on your shared vacation but you also sound incredibly unsupportive and judgmental of her issues with her weight. You both sound unpleasant and miserable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She's been checked for PCOS & thyroid and her weight isn't related to issues with those, it all comes from her diet.\n\nObviously, I love her, but, this weight thing is one hell of a roller coaster and nowhere was that more spotlighted than last week when we took a week off for a beach trip.\n\nWe'd had this trip planned since December. We get down there and it started as, \" I'm too fat for my two-piece\" it then became, \" Well, I don't want to wear a one-piece\" and it became, \" I'm not leaving the room\" and \" oh by the way, you aren't leaving either\".\n\nWhen I asked why exactly her not feeling great about her weight or her body meant that my trip was down the tubes, she flipped that into, \" If you loved me you wouldn't complain\".\n\nI told her that, this wasn't a case of me springing a trip on her out of nowhere, she had 6 months to get in shape that she could be happy with, and she didn't.\n\nWe spent 5 days arguing and, only those last 2 days was I able to get her to go to the beach, to the pool. She kept saying I'd ruined her trip because she felt \" on display\". I told her she'd ruined my trip.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm comfortable, but also then part of the gathering.", "Probably goes without mentioning, but yeah, there was a lot of, \" everyone will stare at me\" and I had to tell her, people are too wrapped up in their phones and their own people and their own stuff to focus on what others are doing.", "She is", "she was more miserable on the beach than she was in the room", "No. Not true at all. Plenty of AITA posts where men get angry on vacations because of XYZ and make their wife and children suffer for the vacation and people excuse him too.... This isn't a gender flip situation.

You just said she's had issues with her weight for years. Six months of diet and exercise isn't enough time for a complete body transformation.

It really didn't matter to other people.\nI found that quite reassuring.\nHe had a hissy fit!  \ud83d\ude36\n\nI should have seen that as a red flag...", "I didn't say anything about your therapy suggestion. I said she had deep anxiety, and not \"main character syndrome\". \n\nMain character syndrome is something you say about self centered people to highlight that they  see other people as side characters in their story rather than real people with real lives. \n\nAnxiety issues are not that."]}
