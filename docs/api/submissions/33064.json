She knows I want us to go one day either as a family or as a couple, but need it to work financially due to it\u2019s expensive reputation. She told me I was never considered to be invited because I don\u2019t have enough vacation leave to take this fiscal year (which is true) plus I said \u201c(I) didn\u2019t want to go\u201d (not true and she knows it). She proposed taking our one daughter \u201cso (I) won\u2019t need help\u201d while she\u2019s gone. Our 2 year old daughter is a horrendous sleeper though, often catches illnesses from daycare, and I won\u2019t have leave to care for her if she gets too sick to attend daycare.\n\n- My wife returned from Colorado a week ago after visiting her best friend there for 4 nights because her friend\u2019s IVF failed. (We live in Canada FYI). There were no objections from me, so long as I was able to ensure that my mom was available to help me with the kids (and she was). Things went smoothly for both of us and I even told my wife that things were going so well on my side that she could totally extend her trip if she wanted.\n\n- My wife and I are travelling with my friends (well our friends, but my friends originally) to Puerto Vallarta this January for a week as a 40th birthday trip. She\u2019s bitter about PV as the destination because she wanted Hawaii (she loves PV but we\u2019ve been there twice in two years) but her Hawaii proposal got shut down due to expense and logistics (some couples are only able stay 5 nights)\n\n- Furthermore, she is going to Palm Springs in early April with her girlfriends to celebrate their 40th. Again, I\u2019m totally cool with this, as my mom is available (and genuinely happy) to help while my wife is away.\n\n- Despite all of this, my wife thinks I\u2019m being a jealous, controlling asshole because I was livid when she told me about this, and said (very angrily) I did not support her planning another trip given the number of trips that are already on the books. I also told her never to try pulling this again, (proposing a trip without me behind my back). Her response was I can\u2019t tell her what to do. My response was fine, but I reserve the right to be fucking livid about it.\n\n- My mother in law and sister in law live in the same city as us, and they (and sometimes we all) have travelled together in the past, so it isn\u2019t like they never see each other or don\u2019t travel together. Also for the record I like my mother in law and sister in law a lot.\n\n- Finally, my wife\u2019s mom suffered a traumatic brain injury 10 years ago, which has resulted in emotional changes with my mother in law (she\u2019s pretty even tempered overall, but she can get irrationally upset/offended over things at times, so the idea of this trip getting yanked out from under her worries me)", "created_utc": 1702623564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18iu7s6/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_stop_planning/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also , do you get a weekend away without the family? Who pays for these breaks? Is your wife working?", "NTA\n\nShe sounds incredibly selfish.  Its fair enough to want to do things separately but not telling you about the trips and also how many she is going on is both rude and very unfair on you.\n\nThe whole taking the 4 year old under the pretence of not leaving you with too much work is nonsense.  You still have the 2 year old and I'm pretty sure the 8 year old is going to quite rightly feel left out.\n\nMy guess is she is the kind of person who wouldn't react well if you told her you had arranged to go on a golfing holiday with friends in a couple of months without informing her before you booked it all.", "Maybe it's time to plan a weekend fishing ur whatever for you and son. Tell her about it after it's planned. Or with some buddies.", "NTA these things are a team effort at some point at least. But side note, what do you guys do for a living to afford traveling so often (with kids) and get that time off", "NTA. You work all week, she works weekends, and she doesn't seem to like you very much, or her kids... OH, I'll take a fancy vacation but you can't come is pretty darn disrespectful. And the You don't have enough time off but I'll leave a 2 year old with you just shows it wasn't about your leave at all. And how does the 8 year old feel?

But in all the examples you laid out, you kept saying you were fine with it, fine with it, etc. except the most recent.\n\nThe issue I see is the discrepancy between her ability to travel and yours. Your time off and the balance of both work schedules means, as you stated in a comment, it takes more planning in advance, but then it often doesn\u2019t take priority. This is fine though and your wife needs to commit to helping make it work for you to be able to travel too.\n\nI think your response to her is understandable and certainly your feelings are valid, but I think you went about it the wrong way. At another time, in another conversation, you need to calmly point out this discrepancy and explain that you want to be able to take trips too, whether individually or as a family. Look at the calendar for next year and have your wife block off a few weekends for the purpose of your individual trips and discuss the weeks where you would need time off for couples or family trip. Lay it all out at once.\n\nIs there a reason why your mom can\u2019t help with your kids on the weekend if you were to travel and your wife was working?\n\nGood luck!", "INFO - did she buy the tickets to Hawaii without talking to you first or is she still in the planning stages?\n\nAlso INFO - who\u2019s birthday is being celebrated in Puerto Vallarta?

I would say counseling before the marriage explodes.\n\nShe wants to travel...she can pay...you want her to stay home until you can go... you are furious...not a good situation.\n\nBetter work this out.", "NTA. I mean good for her for paying for these trips, but I\u2019m really having a hard time wrapping my mind around a parent of 3 kids under 10  being able to take multiple child-free (and spouse-free) vacations in a year\u2019s time. That obviously places a lot of responsibility on the other partner and their support system. You say you don\u2019t have a problem with most of it, but it can\u2019t help but highlight relationship inequities and eventually cause resentment.\nI\u2019d also think the grandparents, aka support system, would start to side-eye this after a while.", "NTA\n\nYeah this kind of stuff doesn\u2018t work anymore when you have kids. My husband and I were (or still are) in the same spot. We agreed on one long weekend away for each of us per year. There\u2018s still sport\u2018s training camps, his tournaments and stuff where he\u2018s gone several days or whole weekends, which I accept as long as I feel like accepting it because it\u2018s important to him. \n\nI\u2018d find it incredibly hurtful if he just wanted to go on vacation several times a year without me. I also work weekends (only 1 or 2 a month though), so we\u2018d never spend time as a family if he did that.

You are probably in no position to feel the pain of a failed IVF but a spa trip, a shopping spree and some hiking are sometimes coping mechanisms rather than holidays.\n\nIn general, you can ask her to discuss things with you in advance but your tone (based on what you described here) very much makes you the a-hole. She isn\u2019t using your money, you get to stay with your kids for a few days with help from your mom usually and you still feel entitled to be livid (I take this to mean you started yelling and telling her off).\n\nWho takes care of the kids during the week?

In the body of this I went out of my way to make it crystal clear that she very much had my support for the other two solo trips, because help was/is lined up . Again, the number of trips are getting excessive (and Hawaii is a huge trip compared to say, Colorado) and I\u2019m pissed I wasn\u2019t consulted in advance. \n\n2) I am not counting the trip to PV as one of the three solo vacations, I\u2019m counting Colorado as 1, Palm Springs as 2, and Hawaii as 3. PV was included for context (because yes, we still vacation together, but at the same time, it illustrates motive for planning a solo Hawaiian vacation behind my back).\n\n3) We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree on whether Colorado constitutes a \u201cvacation\u201d. Yes, supporting her friend served as the impetus for this trip, but this was most definitely not a trip where her friend was crying on her shoulder in the living room. It was hiking, sightseeing, a spa trip, soaking in hot springs, Target shopping, tons of restaurants and litres of wine. She came back refreshed AF and happy to have enjoyed her break from work and momming. So say what you will, but for all intents and purposes I call the Colorado trip a vacation. \n\nEdit: Why don\u2019t we split the difference and say that the Colorado trip counts simultaneously as \u201csupporting her friend\u201d and as a \u201cvacation\u201d?\n\nThanks for your comment. Even if we don\u2019t see eye to eye on everything, it gave me the opportunity to add additional context (for example, that the Colorado trip may have been initiated for \u201cdowner\u201d reasons, but it most definitely was not a \u201cdowner\u201d trip)", "show us on the doll where men hurt you", "Again, good opportunity to clarify some things here:\n\n- The daycare/school takes care of the kids during the week (during the day). In terms of childcare outside of daycare/school we\u2019re split pretty evenly during the week. My wife does slightly more \u201ccare\u201d stuff at home (doing the girls\u2019 hair, packing lunches) while I do virtually all pick ups/drop offs and academics for our son. Obviously there are many more details to pore over but suffice to say it\u2019s more or less even during the week, and I definitely do more during the weekends because she\u2019s out shooting (which is fine; it\u2019s the nature of her job).\n\n- Why do I get to be livid? Because who the fuck starts planning a Hawaiian vacation without their spouse and two of their three kids without consulting their spouse first?! If the tables were turned in your life and this you truly don\u2019t think you\u2019d tell your spouse off, my hat goes off to you. I\u2019m not even being sarcastic, seriously, you\u2019re the better person.\n\n- Of course I want to be included in the trip to Hawaii! Actually this touches on another important point. The destination is a factor too, because we both want to go to Hawaii (together) one day, and with her going without me, it dramatically reduces our chances of us all going together one day because of a) the expense, and b) my wife doesn\u2019t like returning to far away destinations, no matter how much she enjoys them (she prefers to try going  somewhere new). So yeah, I consider that to be super selfish of her.\n\n- Yes, I\u2019ve had help in the past, but in this instance I would not feel comfortable asking my mom for help if my wife were to go to Hawaii, because I\u2019m just, embarrassed from having to ask for so much damned help already. My mom (and dad too) will be watching our kids while we go to Mexico too.", "So you are saying you can't just randomly decide to take a vacation without talking to her first? Makes sense. \n\nWhy don't these rules apply to her again?", "Perhaps book a couple of weekends away with friends. She leaves child care to you for her, and you can do likewise. Just make sure you have at least one family holiday all together a year.", "Father-son bonding time is a good thing.", "If you planned something for you and your son it might just be a good bonding time for you. You don't have to make reservations but maybe start checking into things and if you find something you like ask him if he likes it too then tell wife you want to do it. Then book it. Son would probably enjoy time alone with you without sisters around.", "Time to get some re-wiring done.", "yeah! why would she take the middle child? wouldn't taking the baby be less stressful for OP?", "whos paying everything else with the house and kids", "I get it now. Most of this is just noise - Bottom line is, you wanted and expected and looked forward to experiencing Hawaii as a couple and you are HURT that she is disregarding that or not seeing it as important.\n\nHave you told her this?
