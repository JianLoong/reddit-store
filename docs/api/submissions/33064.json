She proposed taking our one daughter \u201cso (I) won\u2019t need help\u201d while she\u2019s gone.

I also told her never to try pulling this again, (proposing a trip without me behind my back). Her response was I can\u2019t tell her what to do. My response was fine, but I reserve the right to be fucking livid about it.\n\n- My mother in law and sister in law live in the same city as us, and they (and sometimes we all) have travelled together in the past, so it isn\u2019t like they never see each other or don\u2019t travel together. Also for the record I like my mother in law and sister in law a lot.\n\n- Finally, my wife\u2019s mom suffered a traumatic brain injury 10 years ago, which has resulted in emotional changes with my mother in law (she\u2019s pretty even tempered overall, but she can get irrationally upset/offended over things at times, so the idea of this trip getting yanked out from under her worries me)", "created_utc": 1702623564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18iu7s6/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_stop_planning/", "score": 499, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its fair enough to want to do things separately but not telling you about the trips and also how many she is going on is both rude and very unfair on you.\n\nThe whole taking the 4 year old under the pretence of not leaving you with too much work is nonsense.  You still have the 2 year old and I'm pretty sure the 8 year old is going to quite rightly feel left out.\n\nMy guess is she is the kind of person who wouldn't react well if you told her you had arranged to go on a golfing holiday with friends in a couple of months without informing her before you booked it all.", "Maybe it's time to plan a weekend fishing ur whatever for you and son.

But in all the examples you laid out, you kept saying you were fine with it, fine with it, etc. except the most recent.\n\nThe issue I see is the discrepancy between her ability to travel and yours. Your time off and the balance of both work schedules means, as you stated in a comment, it takes more planning in advance, but then it often doesn\u2019t take priority. This is fine though and your wife needs to commit to helping make it work for you to be able to travel too.\n\nI think your response to her is understandable and certainly your feelings are valid, but I think you went about it the wrong way. At another time, in another conversation, you need to calmly point out this discrepancy and explain that you want to be able to take trips too, whether individually or as a family. Look at the calendar for next year and have your wife block off a few weekends for the purpose of your individual trips and discuss the weeks where you would need time off for couples or family trip. Lay it all out at once.\n\nIs there a reason why your mom can\u2019t help with your kids on the weekend if you were to travel and your wife was working?\n\nGood luck!", "INFO - did she buy the tickets to Hawaii without talking to you first or is she still in the planning stages?\n\nAlso INFO - who\u2019s birthday is being celebrated in Puerto Vallarta?

That obviously places a lot of responsibility on the other partner and their support system. You say you don\u2019t have a problem with most of it, but it can\u2019t help but highlight relationship inequities and eventually cause resentment.\nI\u2019d also think the grandparents, aka support system, would start to side-eye this after a while.", "NTA\n\nYeah this kind of stuff doesn\u2018t work anymore when you have kids.

You are probably in no position to feel the pain of a failed IVF but a spa trip, a shopping spree and some hiking are sometimes coping mechanisms rather than holidays.\n\nIn general, you can ask her to discuss things with you in advance but your tone (based on what you described here) very much makes you the a-hole.

In the body of this I went out of my way to make it crystal clear that she very much had my support for the other two solo trips, because help was/is lined up . Again, the number of trips are getting excessive (and Hawaii is a huge trip compared to say, Colorado) and I\u2019m pissed I wasn\u2019t consulted in advance. \n\n2) I am not counting the trip to PV as one of the three solo vacations, I\u2019m counting Colorado as 1, Palm Springs as 2, and Hawaii as 3. PV was included for context (because yes, we still vacation together, but at the same time, it illustrates motive for planning a solo Hawaiian vacation behind my back).\n\n3) We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree on whether Colorado constitutes a \u201cvacation\u201d. Yes, supporting her friend served as the impetus for this trip, but this was most definitely not a trip where her friend was crying on her shoulder in the living room. It was hiking, sightseeing, a spa trip, soaking in hot springs, Target shopping, tons of restaurants and litres of wine. She came back refreshed AF and happy to have enjoyed her break from work and momming. So say what you will, but for all intents and purposes I call the Colorado trip a vacation. \n\nEdit: Why don\u2019t we split the difference and say that the Colorado trip counts simultaneously as \u201csupporting her friend\u201d and as a \u201cvacation\u201d?\n\nThanks for your comment. Even if we don\u2019t see eye to eye on everything, it gave me the opportunity to add additional context (for example, that the Colorado trip may have been initiated for \u201cdowner\u201d reasons, but it most definitely was not a \u201cdowner\u201d trip)", "show us on the doll where men hurt you", "Again, good opportunity to clarify some things here:\n\n- The daycare/school takes care of the kids during the week (during the day). In terms of childcare outside of daycare/school we\u2019re split pretty evenly during the week. My wife does slightly more \u201ccare\u201d stuff at home (doing the girls\u2019 hair, packing lunches) while I do virtually all pick ups/drop offs and academics for our son. Obviously there are many more details to pore over but suffice to say it\u2019s more or less even during the week, and I definitely do more during the weekends because she\u2019s out shooting (which is fine; it\u2019s the nature of her job).\n\n- Why do I get to be livid? Because who the fuck starts planning a Hawaiian vacation without their spouse and two of their three kids without consulting their spouse first?! If the tables were turned in your life and this you truly don\u2019t think you\u2019d tell your spouse off, my hat goes off to you. I\u2019m not even being sarcastic, seriously, you\u2019re the better person.\n\n- Of course I want to be included in the trip to Hawaii! Actually this touches on another important point. The destination is a factor too, because we both want to go to Hawaii (together) one day, and with her going without me, it dramatically reduces our chances of us all going together one day because of a) the expense, and b) my wife doesn\u2019t like returning to far away destinations, no matter how much she enjoys them (she prefers to try going  somewhere new). So yeah, I consider that to be super selfish of her.\n\n- Yes, I\u2019ve had help in the past, but in this instance I would not feel comfortable asking my mom for help if my wife were to go to Hawaii, because I\u2019m just, embarrassed from having to ask for so much damned help already. My mom (and dad too) will be watching our kids while we go to Mexico too.", "So you are saying you can't just randomly decide to take a vacation without talking to her first?

You left out hella important details....to the point that it would affect a lot of previous judgements.\n\n\nLook she needs to talk to you first about trips. You could have just calmly discussed with her instead of getting mad about it.\n\nYou suck because you made it seem like you never go on any trips, you pay for everything, and that she already booked the trip and she never discussed this with you.\n\nHer dream vacation is Hawaii. She's tried multiple times to go and hasn't. The TWO of you are doing a huge trip for YOUR birthday...to Mexico after the rest of your friend group shot down Hawaii. Again. You chose to go to Mexico with friends over going on a trip to Hawaii with just your wife. You made that choice.\n\nI'm sorry OP...but it's a big deal for her to go. YOU didn't make it a priority. And that's fine. It is for her. So since you choose other vacations over that....she's going to go with her Mom and sister.\n\nAnd now you're mad about it??\n\nShe's planning a trip. Nothing's been booked. She didn't do anything without you aside from not telling you first.... Everyone is literally still talking. Nothing's been done .. \n\nYou just seen jealous that she's able to do this. She makes her own money...and it's a significant amount. You failed to mention that tidbit in your post too. She works a high paying job with minimal hours. She splits all your bills 50/50 and pays for her own trips independently. Only working weekends. Her schedule is planned out well in advance because of this. You're acting like she booked a trip and is leaving next week.\n\nAlso you're acting like she's spending tons of money...when in fact she's excels at saving money by finding killer deals for all your trips. It takes A LOT of effort and time to find those deals. Sometimes you need to book them quickly...even if the travel is a long time away. She needs to know the availability and budgets of those going ON the trip... It's probably WHY she dicussed the trip with your in-laws first and not you.\n\nYou're also punishing her for your job limitations. I'm sorry you have used up all your PTO.... But her job allows for flexibility. And you used your PTO for other vacations.... So it's not a matter of you never doing anything either.\n\nYou can ask for her to talk to you first about wanting to go somewhere with her family. You cannot forbid her from going...just because you cannot go with her anymore since you had multiple chances and failed to do so and used up all your available time for other vacations you wanted to do. Also you could go through the time and effort to plan trip with your wife like you claim you want...instead of always leaving it up to her...also another reason why it probably stings for her that you're mad about this.\n\nAlso with her Mom's brain injury....maybe she's wanting to spend time and do a meaningful trip with her Mom while she is still \"her Mom\"... I'm sorry that the TBI is affecting her brain and behavior,.. unfortunately things will only continue to deteriorate over time.\n\n\nLook I get you always want to get consulted first.... sometimes things happen and your not. This is just one of those times. It's just hard for me to feel you're nt-a in this because this wasn't out of the blue. Your wife has been trying to go to Hawaii....and you've been choosing elsewhere .. for whatever reasons. It wasn't a priority for YOU....and you made that clear to her. You don't get to be upset with her for not giving up on it. Yes obviously there's the whole childcare issue to work out....but THAT isn't the ACTUAL problem going on here....now is it OP?!? Everyone is voting in your favor because of the details you left out and focusing on the kids...and not the real problem between you and your wife.... If you truly care about resolving this issue with your wife and aren't just seeking \" I'm right you're wrong\" validation ... hopefully this response helps you understand where she is coming from....\n\nAlso I do not understand why you just didn't use the time to go on a trip to Hawaii with your wife. You wrote about how much you NEED/WANT on an alone trip with her..... Yet you kept picking other trips and frankly people (friend vacation ring a bell??) OVER your wife. You can't claim something is a huge priority then cry foul when you had multiple chances to do it and willfully picked other things. That's what your wife has been trying to tell you OP.... So maybe listen to her NOW and follow through with your alleged priorities.

There\u2019s a 3000 character limit for the body of my post, and it took many edits to pack in the information that I did. The solo trip she just took, and the one she has on the books are relevant as, a) they are close together and b) it illustrates that I\u2019m totally supportive of her taking solo trips if they are discussed with me in advance and I don\u2019t think she\u2019s taking an excessive amount in a given period time. Also I would be a bazillion times more lax about this if we weren\u2019t parenting 3 young children.\n\n- My wife most definitely does not have a high paying job with minimal hours (in fact I explicitly stated in a prior comment that we both work full time). You\u2019ve inferred that she only works weekends because I mentioned that she shoots on weekends, but she shoots during the week too, and editing (and communicating with clients) takes up way more of her time than shooting. This is a common misconception about photographers, and one that irks my wife to no end. After taxes her income is moderate, as is mine.\n\n- Just because my wife proposed Hawaii previously when planning our group trip, does not make it her \u201cdream vacation\u201d. Hawaii has only really come up (mutually) in the last year as a contender, and one that we are both interested in (under the right circumstances). Hawaii was never raised by my wife (or me) until about a year ago.\n\n- WE, not just SHE excels at finding killer deals for our trips. Your wording implies that she\u2019s the one doing all the work planning our trips/scoring deals. That\u2019s not accurate. Also the only \u201cdeal\u201d she identified was the airfare. She suddenly had very little to say when asked about accommodations and food.\n\nAlso I cannot emphasize enough the relevance of us raising three young children together as a married couple. If you\u2019re actually in my shoes (married with three young kids) and you don\u2019t find the scenario I described offensive, you are 100% morally superior to me (and I\u2019m not saying that with snark; you seriously are)", "This implies we aren\u2019t equal parents to our children, which is pretty sexist. Also I can assure you there\u2019s no way in god\u2019s green earth my wife could parent our three kids with me gone for the week without help or drastically reducing her work schedule. \n\nKeep in mind our kids ages. Yes, our 8 year old is (mostly) a breeze now, but the 2 and 4 year old require an insane amount of attention, wake up multiple times almost every night, and constantly get sick from daycare.", "Yes they get to be livid because she's just booking stuff with nothing prepared lol", "When you're booking a week long holiday without telling your partner then somethings wrong", "Ops wife is not planning trips for *them.* She is planning trips for *her* without talking to the person who would be responsible for everything while she is away.", "Nta but make her take all kids with her not only one. \n\nSince she's free and in company she can take care of all of them especially since you have no Vacation left in case one gets sick.\n\nAlso agree for the future that you agree in advance on a number of trips a year and only mutually approved", ">She pays for the vacations she takes alone.\n\nSo, what is actually the problem? Is it that she's going to a destination (Hawaii) that you wanted to go to?\n\nBecause the real problem seems to be that you have much less vacation time than her, and she's unwilling to sit around at home when she has time off and you can't take any.\n\nSince you don't get as much time off, it sounds like you need to prioritize the trips that you want to do as a family, instead of trips with friends.", "But it is still a trip away from the family which is OPs issue with how often she does it", "100% not because our son has school.

Regardless of your mother-in-law\u2018s brain\ufffc injury and potential reaction, I think it\u2019s an incredibly valid conversation to have with your wife that this vacation needs to be canceled. If she goes, it will do permanent, irreparable damage to your relationship. \n\nYou need to sit down and have an honest, calm conversation with her about the root reasons for your (extremely valid) hurt and disappointment. Ask her how exactly she expects you to feel when:\n- she\u2019s fully aware you have both had a Hawaiian trip on your bucket lists to enjoy as an entire family, yet she very intentionally planned it at a time she knows neither you, nor the entire family can go.\n - she\u2019s gaslighting you by saying you said you didn\u2019t want to go. \n - she has a history of not wanting to go back to places she\u2019s already been, so this trip basically takes Hawaii off the table as a family trip, and for you personally. \n- intentionally or not she\u2019s holding her mother\u2019s potential reaction over your head, which essentially results in you feeling blackmailed into going along with this.  \n- she\u2019s leaving 2 children with you, when your mom is already over-extended, you have no leave, and one of the kids is prone to illness due to her age. \n - she\u2019s choosing only one of your children to take with her which would be incredibly hurtful to your son, yet she seems very cavalier about his feelings and yours.\n- her selfishness is not only deeply hurtful to you, but has the potential for deep, long-term damage to your marriage.\n\nDon\u2019t come at her out of anger, don\u2019t get angry during the conversation. Take the time to tap into your real emotions and be vulnerable enough to be completely truthful about your feelings.  If she doesn\u2019t respond with anything other than, \u201ccrap, you\u2019re right. I got excited for this opportunity and didn\u2019t take all this into account. I\u2019m so sorry honey, I\u2019ll talk to my mom tomorrow, and we can work on planning a trip for the whole family.\u201d, then you know you have some very serious problems in your marriage. \n\nIf she digs her heels in, I believe the only way you\u2019ll survive this without deep resentment is marriage counseling. Because she\u2019s not in a marriage at that point, she\u2019s using marriage to get what she wants and doesn\u2019t give a shit what you want. Talk to her, and good luck.

You need some therapy to understand why you allow her to do whatever she wants and how to deal with it better (giving an ultimatum is likely just going to cause her to lash out since no one likes getting an ultimatum no matter the reason). Also, if you want to maintain your marriage (and this is something you need to figure out in personal therapy) you are probably going to need couples counseling to figure out why she thinks it is okay to do whatever she wants but you are not allowed to (and why she treats you the way she does) and how to come to a middle ground on things.", "Did she schedule this trip when your son is in school?
