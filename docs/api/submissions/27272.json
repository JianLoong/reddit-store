No matter what I did or said his wife would claim I was behaving rudely or maliciously and would scream and cry until I apologised.\n\nMy brother, her parents and her brother contacted me over the years to explain this was how she \"related to girls\". Screaming and crying and \"reconciling\" afterwards was her way to be close to girls and I was urged many times to play along and accept this about her because over time we would become close from it.  \n\nBut it got to the point where it was unbearable. Every message and interaction with her was exhausting and she delighted in putting me down in front of other people. \n\nMy brother absolutely enabled this and made everything worse. In fact the final straw was him secretly recording a conversation we had where he asked me some deeply personal questions (at the time I thought he was trying to be vulnerable together to mend our relationship) and I caught him playing the recording to her as they both laughed at me.\n\nI got a job opportunity far away and jumped at it, making going no contact suddenly much easier, and have not spoken to either of them since. They have also not tried to contact me since I moved. \n\nThey recently had a child, something I only know about because my mum told me, and she has begun pestering me to visit them and send gifts/messages. I have tried to say \"no, thank you\", and even explained if they reached out I would respond, but I am not interested in initiating contact.\n\nBut every conversation I have with her now begins and ends with \"you are an aunt now, you need to act like it\", or some variation. So today I said \"I am not an aunt, I am not in this baby's life in any way\" and she was really upset with me. \n\nShe asked me if I was rejecting her grandchild, which of course I am not. She is welcome to have a relationship with whoever she wants and be as involved as she wants. But I am not in this baby's life, as an aunt or otherwise, and I don't see that changing in the future honestly.\n\nThe conversation only soured from there, with her insisting that if I refuse to accept I am an aunt, then I am claiming she is not a grandmother. She is now not speaking to me and insists I am being unnecessarily hurtful and creating sadness in a time that should be happy... I really don't think of myself as an aunt at all, but am now wondering if it was cruel to voice that thought?

What your brother did was abusive emotionally and your sister was verbally and emotionally abusive. The recording is a huge slap and breach of trust. They do not love or respect you at all.

NTA", "NTA.  You are not obligated to put yourself back in a toxic environment just because your abusers have had a child.  Your mother is being irrational.  Unfortunately, I have no idea how you can get through to her.  You may need to go no- or low-contact with her as well at this point.", "HUGE NTA You were a sister too. It didn\u2019t make any difference. You were a SIL too. Didn\u2019t make any difference. You were disrespected repeatedly. \nNow they want you to behave a certain way because you are an aunt? So sorry!", "NTA, enjoy a more peaceful life going no contact.", "NTA.  You have a seriously narcissistic and dysfunctional family.  Your brother is an absolute creep and has a wife who perfectly suits him.    That poor child doesn't have a chance.\n\nYour mother is also such an AH.  She only cares about appearances.  How she has twisted this situation so she is somehow the injured party is truly pathological.  I guess your brother takes after her.  Did they bully you growing up?\n\nWhat does Mommy Dearest think of how your brother and his wife treated you for years?  I'm sure she told you to get over it.  \n\nI'm sorry OP but this is your mother's choice.  If she does call you again, then let her know again that this is a mutual NC. Ask her why she only holds you accountable for the separation between you and your brother's family. Remind her of their cruelty and how exhausting and hurtful it has been for you.  \n\nYour brother and his wife have no desire to include you in their family life so why would you contact them?  You only know about the baby's existence because ***she*** told you. It's purely biology that makes you an aunt to this baby because there is no relationship with that family.  Again, that is their choice as much as yours.  \n\nOP, get some counseling.  This is so emotionally difficult and you may be facing a total family NC.  You need support.

The \u201cif you say you\u2019re not in the baby\u2019s family, I must not be in the baby\u2019s family either!\u201d excuse is incredibly manipulative.", "Your SIL is a manipulative witch who used her crying and family to train those around her to capitulate to anything she wanted, and to passively accept anything she said.\n\nGive your mom a second chance and ask her if they are threatening to keep her from seeing her grandchild unless she collared you and forced you to comply with their abuse. Be blunt and don't soften the question. You can decide what to do when you have more information.\n\nBut even if she admits that is what they are doing, that's still ***her problem*** to solve, not yours.", "If they are restricting your mother's contact to the baby of you don't return to the family,  that's her issue with them. This is not your problem. \n\nIf true, you do realize that your own mother is ok with you being used as a punching bag by other family members?\n\nKeep your distance. \n\nTell you mother you are maintaining your distance from them.  As far as you're concerned your abusers are not part of you family, therefore you are not an aunt. \n\nActions have consequences. \n\nTell your mom if she continues to push your boundaries you'll be forced to go low contact or even no contact.\n\nNTAc for saying you're not an aunt.", "Building off what your dad said I'm assuming without a scapegoat and no other women to blame it's becoming harder to ignore behaviors.\n\nThey need you back to pretend like it's normal, or to get the tension out. They don't want contact with you they want a punching bag", "Also consider that you have no control over what happens on your mom\u2019s end of the call.  You should assume that every conversation you have with her may be relayed to your brother and SIL, or they may very well be in the same room listening in.", "Oh you are absolutely talked about. You're the one who stood up to them. Their manipulations didn't work directly, so now they're trying through your mum. You need to hold firm or you'll be right back where you were before. Maybe your mum'll realise what they put you through now she's the focus of their toxicity.\nNTA", "This, it's not a \"you\" problem, OP!\n\nYour mother should indeed see them for what they are, if they are using the baby like that", "If mom was more rational, my best guess on why she wouldn't mention any pressure would be that the super easy, logical response would be some quick sympathy followed up by \"That's something you need to take up with them.\"  \n\n\nBut I'm a lawyer who negotiates contracts, so I'm constantly trying to anticipate counter-arguments.  It's usually folly to assume others are strategizing the same way.", "Perhaps she is using \u2014 female mysogyny\u2026or, perhaps, she is confused on her sexuality\u2026", "I knew a woman like this. She always needed a target for her anger & frustration. I was only a kid and didn't understand why I went from being a nice, good kid to being a total failure who can't do anything right."]}
