To make a very long story short she was verbally, physically, and emotionally abusive to me my entire life. She also constantly stole from my dad and did nothing to contribute to the house. More than once her actions almost caused our house to be put into foreclosure. My dad told me once the only reason he stayed with her was because of me. He felt she would make sure he didn\u2019t know where I was or if I was even alive. Looking back, I understand what he meant. Sadly, the legal system was never on his side in the 90s and early 2000s. \n\nFast forward, he got sick when I was in high school and remained chronically ill until his death a few months ago. I tried many times to get him to move in with me but he wasn\u2019t doing anything until he knew the house he worked so hard for was safe. He remained married because he couldn\u2019t kick her out and he wasn\u2019t able to go anywhere for legal assistance as he couldn\u2019t drive. My dad hated my mother and even requested I have her cremated and flush her ashes down the toilet when she dies. \n\nSadly, he got very sick last year and spent months in and out of the hospital. He came to live with me and ultimately lived out his final days on hospice but he was safe, cared for, and loved. \n\nIn the years leading up to this my mother was speaking to multiple men on the internet claiming to be divorced. I have proof of this for least 15 different men and there were likely many more. A majority of these men were scammers but that\u2019s a long story for a different day. \n\nWhen he died I left her name out of the obituary. I didn\u2019t feel she deserved to be recognized as his widow when she\u2019d acted as though she wasn\u2019t married for years. \n\nInitially there was only backlash from my mother, which I expected. However, even though it\u2019s been several months, I\u2019ve gotten feedback from other saying I went too far and what I did was uncalled for. The commentators don\u2019t know the whole situation and I don\u2019t feel the need to explain myself. I stand by my decision and would do it again.

Stay grounded in why you did this. People with opinions rarely know the full story. Your father compromised his adult self to be with you and you were loyal to him in his most needed time. This is love. Your mom, however, did not contribute an inch of empathy or kindness during his decline and demise. Love on.

In the obituary I named myself, my brother and one stepchild. Fuck the other two. Disrespectful assholes.", "NTA.  Even though they were legally still married they hadn't been in a relationship for a long time.  It's not uncommon for ex-partners to be left out of the list of survivors in an obituary.", "Obituaries are funny things, but since she didn't step up and treat folks right, I'd say NTA based on what you've written here.   Remember your father in peace and anyone who doesn't like that can just STFU.", "NTA.

Obituaries are to memorialize the deceased and to recognize those who love them. Your mother clearly didn\u2019t love your father, and he made his distaste of her clear. She treated him poorly and doesn\u2019t deserve to be recognized in writing along with those who love and miss him.", "Mild NTA. Your mom deserved it, and it's probably what your dad wanted. \n\nMy mother and I, and my father's stepchild, are not in his official obituary. (Mother divorced him and I escaped; unsure about the stepchild.) His second wife is the only one shown. His stepgrandchildren are listed as grandchildren, without parents. This is probably what my father wanted. \n\nHowever, there is no way to conceal the truth from a DNA test. Some relative in the next few years is going to get a surprise. Then they are going to be curious. His perfect family will be revealed as fictional. The effort of writing and publishing a scrubbed obit will be in vain.\n\nSo yes, she deserves to be cut out, and you paid for it, so write what you want. Just know that you created a slightly false history, and people will wonder about who censored it, and why.", "NTA but if you stand by your decision and don't feel the need to explain yourself why are you asking here?", "NTA\n\nAnd thats why you don't marry on a whim kids", "First, my heart goes to you over the loss of your father.  \n\nIf you stand by your decision and would do it again why post here?

Neither does it shine a great light on you. And when something is in print, it usually looks better when not created with any ill will-- because it won't be republished differently.", "I may be going out on a limb here but YTA. The obit is about the persona\u2019s life, not other people\u2019s feelings and judgements about the people in the deceased\u2019s life. \n\nIf they weren\u2019t divorced, they were married. Also try to remember that it\u2019s possible nothing will change your feelings about your mother or their relationship but try to remember it was their marriage and both undoubtedly made choices. Also people rarely have the full story on anybody\u2019s relationship, even their parents\u2019, no matter what\u2019s been said. \n\nIt sounds like your dad was magnanimous in his actions when it came to both of you, sounds like a good quality to, maybe even something to strive for.

I\u2019m in my mid 30s and decided for myself more than a decade ago the type of person my mother is. His comments had nothing to do with that. \n\nI respect they were married for a very long time however her actions diminished that time, not his.", "I agree she hasn\u2019t been a good wife. I\u2019m not defending her at all, but leaving her out of the obit was unnecessarily unkind for the sake of unkindness. They were married either way. You didn\u2019t do anything but dig the knife in. \n\nHe could have left her. You\u2019re in your mid thirties.. which means he stayed for 15 years (more!) after you were an adult. Staying for the kids is one thing.. but at some point you\u2019re staying for other reasons. \n\nI know you\u2019re hurting, OP, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an Asshole (at all), but I agree with the people in your life who are saying it was uncalled for. \n\nTake care of yourself OP."]}
