{"id": 24972, "submission_id": "15uyucz", "title": "AITA for leaving itemized tips to compensate for my wife's behavior?", "selftext": "My wife and I (in our 30s) dine out every once in a while but not too often because of my wife's annoying habit, inherited from her family. She always complains, sends food back if it's not absolutely perfect, and makes needless requests/substitutions (she doesn't have allergies or sensitivities). It can easily take 5 minutes for her just to order her own food and sometimes I've already finished my meal by time she gets her food because she sends it back, asks for modifications, etc. I know restaurant staff don't appreciate it. I've tried talking to her about this but she doesn't see an issue with it.\n\nAnyway, we make decent money and we use our combined fun funds on dates/dinners. I recently started writing what my wife does on the receipt and then calculating a tip (in addition to the normal gratuity) to compensate. So, to a receipt I might add:\n\n\\-  Complained about not having \\_\\_\\_ beverage, +$5\n\n\\- Asked 5 questions about a single menu item, +$5\n\n\\- Asked for new drink because too much ice, +$5\n\n\\- Sent meal back, was exactly what she ordered, +$5\n\nShe didn't notice me doing it the first two or three times but last night she noticed I was spending a lot of time on writing a tip amount and asked why. I showed her what I wrote. She's been mad at me since, saying I'm embarrassing her to the staff. I told her she's embarrassing us both.\n\nAITA? Petty, maybe, but an AH?\n\nETA: My wife is otherwise a very nice, caring and generous person. She does always say please and thank you even for her most absurd requests. Annoying each other like this is our love language, but this time she's pretty mad. Oops.\n\nUPDATE: Alrighty friends, we've had our laughs and shared our perspectives. Since my wife frequents this subreddit I went ahead and showed her this post. With that said I'd like to address a few things:\n\nFirst, she and I both know that any posts on this sub are peepholes into people's lives and characters, not display cases. Yes my wife's behavior when dining out is bad which is why I tried to think of a way to point it out and make up for it. That said, she's not a bad person. Learn to separate the two and you'll get far in life.\n\nSecondly, when I say she was (lol... *is*) mad at me I don't mean that she is deeply hurt and distraught. She's calling me an asshole, yes, but that's normal for us. If this was something that was actually hurtful to her, I wouldn't be sharing it online.\n\nAnyway, she would like for you all to know that she is taking your responses to heart and she is going to be more mindful of how she dines. She would like to add that she didn't think it was a big deal before because, as she puts it, she doesn't think twice about meeting expectations in her line of work, even if they are above and beyond the norm, she's just happy to meet demand, but she recognizes that not everyone feels that way. She's going to try to be a better customer.\n\nShe said reading this was brutally eye-opening but we both also found some laughter and had a good discussion.", "created_utc": 1692398684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uyucz/aita_for_leaving_itemized_tips_to_compensate_for/", "score": 8121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a server I think people like that come out to dine not for the food, but to simply boss someone around that they see as beneath them. Maybe she gets treated poorly by customers at her job so she in turn comes to a restaurant to lord power over the poor wait staff.\nShe\u2019s putting peoples jobs in jeopardy for her own sick power play. How gross. If I was a manager at a restaurant she frequented I\u2019d ask her not to come back since she\u2019s never pleased and now she\u2019s costing us money by wasting food.", "That's EXACTLY what you should do for her, you say she's great and you love her despite this habit of hers. Make a list of why you love her as an apology then discuss (very seriously) why she feels the need to act this way about food. Its great that you're lighthearted and fun but this is not a funny situation and should be handled without humor for now. Laugh about it later when yall are all good again.", "Speechless over here.", "Well she could show her gratitude by being less picky and difficult to deal with!", "Even when she\u2019s sent food/drinks back several times? This doesn\u2019t add up\u2026. Make it make sense!", "Returning food COSTS RESTAURANTS MONEY. Unless you\u2019re tipping the cost of the meal, plus more\u2026.you\u2019re essentially asking for a refund or a comp.", "At least she acknowledges what she is doing can have an affect on the restaurant staff.", "I feel that's only appropriate if you asked for no ice due to teeth sensitivity.  Otherwise, if there's too much ice for your taste, you chalk it off as a loss and remember to not order drinks there again.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t have sent it back. I would have drank it all and asked for another with less ice.", "It really depends. If you order lets say,  the fresh-squeezed lemonade for $6.50, and you drink is filled to the brim with ice, then you are not getting what you paid for. It is common for waitstaff to be instructed to do things like this to make money for the restaurant. Don't tell me you have never been pissed off at ordering an expensive drink to find it is 75% ice. I have also seen people complain it's not fair to waitstaff to request no ice etc. Really, that situation is a lose-lose. Ask for less ice? Too picky. Ask for no ice? Annoying and too picky. Expect an appropriate amount of ice for your expensive beverage? Well, you should have asked for that.", "Yeah because it still has pickle juice all over my food and I will literally barf.", "See that changes things, because she's willing to accommodate people as much as they accommodate her. It means she has healthy self esteem and doesn't take it personally when people have strong preferences", "Restaurant staff were just pissed off though.", "You are an enabler and your wife sounds like she needs therapy to get yo the bottom of the real issue - unless, of course, the real issue is that your wife is an obnoxious, power-hungry, annoying, rude and time-wasting b.", "Yes! Maybe give her $5 per course that she doesn't send back! Haha", "love this - plus it's always fun to witness a new fetish being born ;)", "Okay this made us cackle. XD", "This absolutely genius!", "Insufferable is the perfect description, she should do a shift as wait staff for a day, she'd get just how poor this behaviour is.", "It\u2019s not worth that the risk that they\u2019ll spit in both our food.", "I had the nicest lady say her trout was really cold\u2026 I was confused because her order hadn\u2019t sat at all, I\u2019d been quick to be able to get it to her from the kitchen but I said OK no problem I\u2019ll take it back to the kitchen\u2026 Whereupon the cook who took it started roaring with laughter \u2013 he said \u201cyes it\u2019s cold, it\u2019s sushi!\u201d. Turns out somehow it had missed going in the oven and had been prepped but not cooked \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1d and then sent out for me to serve\u2026\n\nI cannot tell you how sweet that lady was when she pretty much had a right to be annoyed that her fish hadn\u2019t even seen the oven before it was served to her!", "Man, one time, I ordered a burger and fries at a Chili's, and the burger was fine and dandy, but the fries were cold the minute they hit the table. I politely asked for the manager and told him something along the lines of it not being a big deal for me as I probably would have only eaten a couple even if they were perfect, but he might want to check in with the cooks before some asshole came in. I just wanted them to be aware there was a problem. My burger got comped, which wasn't my goal, so I just tipped the waitress the cost of the burger on top of my usual generous tip. The moral, even if you have a legitimate complaint, there's no need to be an asshole about it.", "I've sent back overcooked meat. It was basically shoe leather. Luckily the sides were fine so I could eat those until they brought out a new steak (or porkchop? I don't remember).\n\n(worked at fast food, spitting was not a thing, no matter how annoying you were.)", "I'm a nice person at least according to my boss so I'm always as friendly as I can be. But I've had to send it back a few times and Everytime it's only for the absolute worst things. Like raw beef and shit.\n\nPeople who give any workers a hard time for no reason are the absolute worst.", "Ditto, only thing I\u2019d add is if the food is burnt. X", "We could but no one's actually that petty. We'll fucking bitch about you, OPs wife has had horrendous shit said about her... In the back!\n\nNot worth my job, and one more order to the kitchen is meh. Good places won't regularly have a lot coming back. \n\n\nOnly time in the last 10 years I've sent food back, nice expensive steak restaurant in Canary wharf, London, she ordered rare, I as asked for medium. They came out over on both, hers med, mine well done.\n\n\nThey cleared the table and refired the entire thing, took maybe 10 minutes, they comp'd the 2 glasses of wine as well", "Same here. Like, I'll only send something back if it's something I literally can't eat - like once a burger came with jalapenos that I didn't order and that weren't normally on the burger, and I can't eat them because I'm mildly allergic (they're not going to kill me, but they make me really miserable for a while). Or if something is burnt beyond edibility or underdone like you said. Otherwise nope, I'll just be quiet and eat it!", "While it's true they could, and there certainly are some shitty people out there who regardless what their job is, could do some fucked up things to get back at a patron they feel slighted by, ~20 years in food service (half in cooking and half in management/hybrid roles) tells me that's overabundantly not what most would do.\n\nSee, it's one of those things where generally the people who do it actually like, even love, doing it....it's a passion, something they take care and pride in. And regardless if it's a high class place with cooks/chefs who went to culinary school, or a more family (and cost) friendly spot, that's pretty universally true from my experience. There may be a few POS's who'd fuck with people's food, but they truly are few and far between. Even when they're not paid all that well. \n\nAs one who was not formally trained in school, I'm one of those types. Something about the enjoyment of knocking someone's socks off when they eat food you've prepared for them is just beautiful to the soul. I was always an artist, especially working with pizza dough. I can't begin to explain the satisfaction of pulling something out of the oven (the last 2 I worked in were open kitchen concepts where the pizza makers were out in front) and literally hearing customers at the counters, or the servers waiting for the pie/boli they're taking to a table and just going \"wow, that looks amazing.\" Then, hearing it from the table they deliver it to. Honestly music to my soul every time. I genuinely miss that part of it, but I still get it at home when I cook for my lady and our kiddo (and the same for when she does, as she's quite adept in the kitchen as well).\n\nThat's not to say OP's wife's habit isn't still beyond annoying, but it can be downright disheartening for a cook (or server if we're talking drinks) because it makes them feel far less disciplined and \"good\" at what they do than they may actually be.\n\nI can say in that time there was only ever one instance where it came to my attention someone had messed with someone's food. It was a long time friend who was a delivery driver, and he had to take a remake to someone and was pissed because they didn't tip him well. So he apparently, on the sly, got a large souffle cup and filled it with jalapeno brine. Then dumped it all over the plain pizza he was redelivering. I was running the joint that night. Lady came in, slammed the soggy thing down on my front counter and I could immediately smell the jalapeno. Once she told me what was up, I immediately saw the name and knew that thing hadn't left the store like that.\n\nTook A LOT of apologizing and genuinely expressing that neither I, nor any one of my cooks, would do that. And that I knew it hadn't left like that, because I cut and boxed it myself.  Dude happened to be out on another delivery at the time, so after I made good with the rightfully pissed off customer, I waited for him to get back. We'd worked together a long time, and we were friends outside the place. Told him I had no choice but to fire him on the spot when he returned. He admitted what he'd done, and all I could say to him was \"how could you possibly put the business, and me, in such a state of liability should something bad have happened?\"\n\nI saw the look in his eyes shift, as if he hadn't considered that, and I said \"yeah man, someone could've had an allergy to it and went into anaphylaxis, or maybe they have ulcers and this causes a GI bleed. You could've harmed someone whether you intended to or not. And all over what, a buck or two?\"\n\nHe didn't argue about it anymore with me. Just nodded and left.\n\nMy point being that's the one time over a loooong period of time where I witnessed something like that, and I was witness to fuck tons of food being served to others. As funny as the movie *Waiting* is, and I love it, it's very much embellished and leans into that urban legend type of stuff regarding dining out.\n\nBut I digress, what OP's lass does (even if it's done politely), is make passionate but often times underpaid people feel inept at what they do...not to mention any time \"getting it right\" is going to cost the place money in food waste. Those places have lots of overhead, and often pretty thin profit margins. Not as razor thin as grocery stores, but still really tight. The more waste there is, the harder it is to turn a solid profit. That's not cool from any angle, and especially not to those who are genuinely trying to make our night by really knocking a meal or dessert out of the park. \ud83e\udd15", "Actually putting bodily fluids in someone's food is definitely way out of line, holy shit.\n\nWorst I've ever done was decaf someone for consistently being an asshole for... well, basically as long as he's been coming. Never pays for anything, starts fights constantly if he doesn't get his order for free, and corporate won't let us tell him to go kick rocks because they've got less spine than an oldschool beanie baby. So on the odd occasion when he orders something with espresso, he gets decaf.", "I'm one of four kids. My siblings and I have talked. Every one of us has worked food service.

Some of the guys would mess with the food of their friends who ordered (like hiding an anchovy or jalape\u00f1os or crushed red pepper on one slice), but I never saw anyone deliberately mess with a customer's food.  Except, of course, for the one time I did it myself.  \n  \nI took an order for a woman once, it was only a salad and was under our delivery minimum, but we did it for her anyway.  I actually ended up delivering the order to her, and realized when I got there, that she lived in my boyfriend's old apartment.  Joked about it with her, she was super pleasant, I asked for payment - her total was $6.25, and she gave me a five, a single, and a quarter.  No tip, and I was only paid hourly, not per delivery.  I was pissed.  Got back to the restaurant and complained about getting stiffed after we did her the courtesy of delivering her order to begin with, and another driver said she'd done the same thing to him the last time she ordered.  \n  \nCouple weeks later, an order comes in on a Friday night, in the middle of a rush, to the same address.  I was on the make line that night, saw the ticket, recognized the address, and got mad all over again.  Well, she ordered a large Big Pie, which was our version of the super-supreme everything pizza.....and I made sure she got EVERYTHING.  \n  \nAfter saucing the dough and adding a layer of pepperoni, I scraped all of the old scattered toppings off the make table onto her pizza - stuff that had been dropped over the course of the night and dried up and got warm and gross.  Crunchy shredded cheese, dried up wrinkly olives, sloppy green peppers and onions, greasy meat, and sooooo much semolina flour from all the dough we'd stretched that night.  It had to be a solid pound of extra shit.  Then I put the rest of the toppings on the pizza, topped it with cheese, and threw it in the oven.  \n  \nLo and behold, the driver that delivered it got stiffed.  He was complaining when he got back, so I told him what I did and he laughed and thanked me, said it made his night so much better.  And she never ordered again, so I considered that a massive win for us.  And who knows, maybe she learned her lesson.  Don't mess with people who handle your food and know your address.  \n  \nAnd before anyone comes at me for \"ohhh but what about allergies, you could've killed her\" ..... I didn't scrape anything onto that pizza that didn't normally come on that pizza.  It was just terrible disgusting quality toppings.  I'm an asshole, not a sociopath lol", "My mate and i when we were working together used to joke about it with particular customers. He was BOH and I was FOH.

Or this chick just pissed on the floor i just mopped, her gravy could use some bubbles.\n\nThat being said, it was never serious and it never once actually happened. We both know that's absolutely disgusting. Those situations were handled by him as he was also the manager. The guy who was harassing me was removed after the police were called and the one who pissed on the floor was sent outside to wait for her food while I cleaned up her mess and told not to come back. It just helped me cope by making a joke about it, because if i let those situations get to me while I was still on the job I wouldn't be able to keep working.

No one is saying, including OP, that the money magically makes it okay. But you know what typically happens in non-tipping countries?

They sit there, do nothing to help you, and occasionally throw you patronising \"apologetic\" glances that do *nothing* to make you feel better.\n\nI'd rather get the extra tips, because at least then I'm getting *something* for my trouble.
