People should focus on eating healthy and be mindful of portions, but counting calories very quickly can become an obsession and lead to disordered eating. Source: Been there done that after having my first kid.", "Yes. It leads people down the path to developing eating disorders because they\u2019ll be so focused on only eating a certain amount of calories daily they\u2019ll keep shrinking the amount to lose weight in an extremely unhealthy way.", "This is America. Now it\u2019s the starving kids down the street.", "Always remember this: no matter how hot she is, there's some guy somewhere who's sick to death of putting up with her shit.\n\nHow this *isn't* OP -- **yet** -- is a mystery.", "Probably stops mid blowjob (because of a stray hair) and has him go back and shave his cock & balls.  Then when he gets back, decides she doesn\u2019t actually want to give the blowjob anymore, and wants him to eat her out instead\u2026 then tells him, \u201cnot like that, do it like my EX used to.\u201d", "If you were my regular I would see how much money I could make her win me", "Probably accurate.", "\ud83d\ude02", "I shudder to think the amount of expectorations your wife\u2019s family has unwittingly swallowed over the years.", "The staff would prefer not to have to tolerate abuse to start with. You laughing about this doesn't make her behaviour acceptable. If you were a decent person you would refuse to go out with her.", "She sounds completely unreasonable when it comes to food.  \n\nSounds like she could really use some help to figure out WHY she\u2019s like this (stop blaming her family\u2026at some point, she CHOSE this behavior).\n\nI would hate to be a guest for dinner in your home, because I might not be able to stop myself from matching her obnoxious energy when she demands critiques.", "Except they are not being compensated financially. Yes, the husband is throwing money at them, but they are still be treated like they are their lessors. What's your price for treating you like crap?  The hubby seems to know since he itemized it out!", "I want to speak to her manager I SPECIFICALLY SAID one BACKflip", "That's another problem we have occasionally.  I'll give it a try! Thanks.", "Shhh..I was just covering for you!", "Ok then.", "Shhhh we don\u2019t talk about that", "I want to endorse this but my wallet doesn't. XD", "They are\u2026exactly being compensated financially. I think everyone should have to work in the service industry to understand what actually goes on behind the scenes. But every server knows that you deal with people like this. Usually they don\u2019t even tip. So if you have to do your job anyway you might as well do it for some poor sucker with a difficult wife who you know will tip you well. It\u2019s just part of serving. I\u2019ve done it and if anything they probably all just talk shit about OPs wife when they leave and it\u2019s entertaining.", "No problem! My kids are 18+ but I have a couple of young bonus kiddos, still works like a charm even 20 years later :)", "Absolutely its a part of serving and as a former server I know this all too well.  I used to get large tips stuffed down my pants by drunk middle aged women while serving brunch with unlimited mimosas.  I guess even though I got treated like shit, at least I got compensated, right?  \n\nSorry, money never should be considered compensation for treating someone like a lessor and taking away their dignity. Never.", "Well let\u2019s go on a campaign to change the entire service industry and expectations. In no way am I excusing this behavior, but we can both agree it\u2019s better to be tipped generously than not"]}
