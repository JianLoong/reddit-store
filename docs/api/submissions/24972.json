It can easily take 5 minutes for her just to order her own food and sometimes I've already finished my meal by time she gets her food because she sends it back, asks for modifications, etc. I know restaurant staff don't appreciate it.

Petty, maybe, but an AH?\n\nETA: My wife is otherwise a very nice, caring and generous person. She does always say please and thank you even for her most absurd requests.

Some of that is perfectly normal. The two of you need to find a middle ground. You can ask for you food however you want want. You can ask about menu items.

IDK but it's annoying.", "I really must stress, as annoying as she is with it, she's not cruel or meaning to be. She says please and emphatic thank-you's. And yes she has actually.
