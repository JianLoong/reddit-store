{"id": 98, "submission_id": "yirl68", "title": "AITA for \u201cparading around with a concealed weapon?\u201d", "selftext": "(repost for length)\n\nToday we had a halloween potluck at work, so I made a 9\u201d layer cake, and brought a cake server plus my 8\u201d chef\u2019s knife. Having a loose knife in the bottom of my bag seemed like a terrible idea so I wrapped it up in a kitchen towel and tucked it under everything else.\n\nThis morning I dropped off the cake and server when I got to work, but forgot to dig out the knife. When I had a free moment between meetings later on I grabbed the towel bundle to bring it over. My path there takes me through a couple of other offices, and a coworker who needed something grabbed me halfway there. By the time I finished that up I needed to rush back to my office for another meeting instead of completing my errand.\n\nSo, since I couldn\u2019t bring it over early, I decided to just take the knife with me when I went over to get food myself. Several people from another department happened to be leaving at the same time when I went through so we walked together. One of them was an admin (let\u2019s call her \u201cMary\u201d) who sits in an area that I have to pass through a lot, and she had already seen me go by with the knife bundle twice.\n\nWe get to the potluck and I unwrapped my knife to cut the first piece and leave it there for others. Mary then pulled me aside after I got my food and (I kid you not) started SCOLDING me like a child for carrying around a sharp object. I thought she was being completely ridiculous making a big deal about it, and said I wasn\u2019t a kindergartner and was perfectly capable of transporting and handling sharps without accidentally murdering someone. This wound her up even more, and she started accusing me of \u201cparading around with a concealed weapon\u201d when I had walked through the office earlier in the day with the knife bundle. \n\nBy now she was loud enough that one of the managers (from another department) noticed and wandered over to see what was going on. I told him she was making a big deal about me bringing a knife to cut the cake. She told him I was \u201cflagrantly disregarding safety protocols\u201d (wrong) and she was correcting me before I hurt someone. I pointed to the table, where our baby-faced fall co-op was in the process of using the knife to cut himself a piece of cake, and sarcastically said that since the actual child could handle it, I was pretty sure no one was in danger of accidental dismemberment. The manager kind of laughed awkwardly, said that we were all capable adults and he trusted our judgement, and suggested we have some pie before hurrying away. Mary started to say something (and looked ready to start the whole thing up again) so I cut her off with a \u201cnope, I\u2019m done with this\u201d and went over to sit with some work friends. When I summarized what happened a couple of people claimed I was being unfair and that Mary was just trying to help. \n\nAITA? Admittedly I probably should have been more diplomatic, but I was hangry and her condescending attitude (while actively preventing me from eating my food) was really irritating.", "created_utc": 1667256900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yirl68/aita_for_parading_around_with_a_concealed_weapon/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
