Having been in the stepbrother\u2019s shoes, when I came in the picture I basically ruined my brother\u2019s life. (Idk why snot on walls is so common but I fully acknowledge how gross that is, except I\u2019d do it in my poor brother\u2019s room) I don\u2019t deny that my developmental disabilities made my brother miserable, even if he does his best to not hold a grudge. All my screaming and running around the house naked made it impossible for my brother to study or have friends over. He ended up spending most of his time in dorms and rarely visited more than once or twice a year.\n\nThat being said, we really can\u2019t control it and forcing Steve to choose between his son or your mom is always going to be a rough one. \nHowever, you also didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter and now you\u2019re thrown into this mess. Maybe your mom is ok with caring for a disabled child, but she forgot to consult you. At the same time, empathy is important and if your sibling were born with a disability, you can\u2019t just kill them. I feel bad for forcing my brother out of the home, which is something he acknowledges was pretty traumatic for him. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to say to make this better or who\u2019s really in the right or wrong here, but I fully empathize with you. If you ever need to talk about it/any coping strategies I\u2019m here for you. You\u2019re allowed to express your frustration at the situation, but please be kind and patient with Jack.", "NTA. I would not agree to such living conditions either.", "Always puzzles me when an adult's choice of a new bed-mate apparently puts their bio kid under some duty to love one or more complete strangers.\n\nYes, OP is being less than sympathetic to the youngster but why should she. She has no investment in this relationship of her mother's and no benefit, quite the opposite.\n\nIf this had been about 'my flat mate has just moved his entire family into my home' there would have been howls of anger. This is the situation OP is in. The fact that the young son is autistic adds a layer of discomfort that OP's mother should have considered before inviting her boyfriend into her daughter's life.\n\nOP is finding her life disrupted and no-one cares. Her distress is valid.", "Eh, idk. This is complicated. My mom married two different men over the course of raising children and just brought them into her children\u2019s lives without consulting the kids. We were all expected to just accept this new person living with us that we didn\u2019t know. Those men were differently, but equally toxic. My mom chose the husbands over her children. It caused trauma for her children that followed them into adulthood. Divorces and parents bringing new partners and THEIR children into an already established household is difficult for kids, to say the least. \n\nYou said \u201cnew boyfriend\u201d but also step-brother. Those two things are confusing to me because if they aren\u2019t married then he\u2019s not your step-brother. Anyways, it\u2019s very valid that you\u2019re struggling with this change in your environment and autism isn\u2019t easy. Your mom should have discussed this with you IMO. But also, your post struck me as lacking empathy or understanding for a little boy with a disability. He\u2019s probably struggling with these big changes too but isn\u2019t as equipped as you yet to explain how he feels. It\u2019s okay to say that living with him is difficult, but it\u2019s not okay to frame his actions as disgusting, annoying, weird, or any of the other adjectives you used. He may learn to regulate his emotions and socialize with people differently as he gets older, but it will be different from when or how you learned these things and that\u2019s okay. \n\nMaybe live with your dad for a while? Honestly IDK. You know your family and situation better than anyone here so just take care of yourself, be kind, find space away if you can. I\u2019d say ESH but sounds like you all might be doing your best in a difficult situation.", "NTA. Autistic or not, a child can still be taught boundaries and consequences. Something which it seems like no one put the effort to do so with Jack. Which is gonna have major consequences for everyone involved as Jack grows up.", "NAH - Is anyone really the asshole here?\n\nJack is obviously NTA. He's a disabled child. It's a sad reality that he really cannot help how he behaves. Hopefully he, and those around him, can learn coping mechanisms to improve his quality of life. It takes a huge commitment, and if you're mom is willing to do that then he is **very** lucky to have her. Don't take that from him.\n\nI wanna say Steve is probably NTA because he's just defending his son. Though I'd have to understand more about the \"berating\" you part to pass full judgement. To be fair, you sound completely disrespectful toward him (\"good-for-nothing\"), and if that's not a symptom of him genuinely treating you poorly, then that's a you problem that needs improving.\n\nBut you're NTA either, because you didn't ask to be brought into a situation where you have to be instantly understanding toward someone who disrupts your life and makes you miserable. You're a kid too, and you do matter as well.\n\nBut seriously, he's a little boy, and you're not. So try to be the bigger person.And if you can't, then just live with your dad, because Jack living in a hostile environment will only make things worse for everyone.", "I'm gonna say ESH, you're not an ass for hating living in a situation your not comfortable in, and your mother is not the ass for wanting to live with her new bf and his kid. But, blaming a mentally disabled seven year old is not cool. He's autistic and literally caan't help it. Your mom sucks for expecting you to just be ok with all this and like the bf and his kid. I would recommend discussing this with your Mother and Father present and try to limit your time over her house if nothing can be done to ensure your comfort in the house. Is it possible to move to your Dads house? That would be my advice if there's no ther option.", "YTA I don't usually call minors assholes, but you're an asshole. You're old enough to understand what autism is and what a disability is. Your step-brother has autism - he's not being weird or childish. Your attitude is disgusting. I don't give a shit whether you like him, but he's a goddamn human being with a neurological disorder that he cannot control and he's *seven*.\n\nIf you can't handle living with a person who has special needs, please, see if you can just stay with your father instead. And grow up.", "YTA. You just sound like you hate Jack for being autistic. He's a disabled child, try to be at least a little bit patient and kind with him. Omg.", "ESH \n\nYou're almost an adult and asking your mom to end her relationship,  which is what would happen if Jack was kicked out, is selfish.  There's a solution here. If jack goes to his moms , those are your days there. When Jack is there, go to your dad's.  You can move out in 2 years, so just try to make it work . You don't have to be bffs with the kid, but I'm sure you can manage to be polite and work with your parents on figuring out a solution", "ESH. \n\nYour mum and her boyfriend: for moving in together without considering how it would affect their kids. \n\nYou: you make it seem like Jack is a bad kid..  Tantrums until he gets what he wants, has a binky at age 7, he is weird and has no friends. He is autistic. He can't control it. I know you're young and it's not fair but don't blame Jack for the way he is. \n\nI think it would probably be better you to limit visits though like you want to. You need to feel safe and comfy in your home. I'm sorry your mum put you in this situation.", "YTA. Jack is disabled. He can not control what he is doing. He is suffering inside.", "NTA. She's choosing her boyfriend over you. Can you stay at your dad's full time and refuse to see her until she apologises to you and then, only at a neutral public place with no boyfriend or kid. \n\nShe doesn't deserve to be a mother, there's no excuse for doing what she's doing to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There\u2019s a reason why autism is considered one of the most difficult diagnosis for a family to deal with.

Something just isn't sitting right for me here. When she stays with her mother that is supposed to be her home and her safe place. Her mother is failing her as a parent because she decided to get in a relationship and ignore her child's mental wellbeing. It's selfish. And now you're telling me that they should just accept that they somehow are less deserving of having their place in their own fucking home at their moms house because Jack needs her more?

He is a kid and his mother should be prioritising him over her new relationship.

Also I think the mom is TA for moving in her 20 years younger boyfriend within a year of the divorce, maybe not the smartest call.

OP is going to be 18 in two years, why not wait until he\u2019s legally an adult to bring the boyfriend in.\n\nI\u2019m also not on board with telling a 16 year old that they should be the bigger person here.
