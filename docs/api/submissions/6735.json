You have no right to try and force people to use the bathroom as that is their body not yours. Still it is understandable to be bothered by such a smell. It is not our place to judge someone for farting as he may have had a medical condition. Still it is embarrassing to be farting in a vehicle around strangers. It is within your rights to have someone get off your bus but to throw coins at them makes you a jerk as someone could have gotten hurt. Stop he was a bit of a jerk for not owning up to it but we don\u2019t know his situation. He is a bit of a jerk while you are a bigger jerk for forcing people to use the bathroom and throwing coins at someone.", "NAH lmao.
