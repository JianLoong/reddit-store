Sometimes that's true, fart leads to poo. Other times it's not, and farting can happen when there's nothing ready to come out (other than more smelly gas a bit later).

But I'm going to assume he wouldn't know (I personally don't get a fart schedule from my body with hours of notice).\n\nPassenger could also have helped by owning up, but he was probably really embarrassed - all the more so the more of a big deal you made it - and there would be really nothing he could do about it if, as above, going to the toilet wouldn't help.\n\nIn which case I'd treat it more like:\n\nWould you kick out someone who has Tourette's and spent 7-9 hours swearing periodically?\nWould you kick out a toddler that had a tantrum every half hour for 7-9 hours?\nWould you kick out someone with a medical device that kept beeping?\nWould you kick out a baby that kept soiling it's nappy and needing to be changed?\n\nIf there's something the passenger can do about it (eg if they're playing loud music, being rude to other passengers, setting off stink bombs, turning up in clothes caked in manure and not washing), then sure, it's on them.\n\nBut if they can't do anything about it, aren't deliberately causing trouble, there is only discomfort rather then danger to other passengers, and they're not doing this so often as to be a significant issue for your company, then I think you should be more inclusive for someone who probably needs to travel for his job and to earn money, and therefore YTA.\n\nIf you genuinely believed that farting is something you can just turn off by going to the toilet, like sometime can turn off their loud music with the volume control, then I can understand why you acted how you did, and then really no-one is to blame as you just didn't know.", "YTA, open a window.\n\nAnd you didn't even properly refund him, yeah you suck.", "There are strong odor control products that are sold in Medicak ostomy supply stores that would help a lot.  \n\n\nMedi-Aire is one such.", "Well if you\u2019re a slitheen in a human skin disguise then you are gonna fart a lot", "I have never been as gassy as I was during pregnancy and the postpartum phases.
