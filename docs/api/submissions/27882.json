Good for her, I'm all for people being who they are. Now, his teacher, in an effort to be supportive, is planning a \"gender reveal\" themed party for the class. The idea is that any kid who wants to can \"reveal\" their chosen gender, not just the transgender student. Meaning, the boys declare as boys and the girls (and the trans student declare as girls).  I think this is a dumb idea, but that's not a hill I'm going to die on.\n\nHere is the problem -- my son and his female friend both want to do gender reveals as the opposite gender for \"fun\". They're not transgender, they're not questioning their identities, they just think it's a cool party trick. My wife says it's harmless and making a big deal is transphobic and to let it go. I'm struggling though. I can't help but think that doing a \"fake\" reveal could be incredibly disrespectful to the transgender student and her family. It also has me thinking that the whole thing is inappropriate.\n\nMy wife is adamant that I shouldn't talk to the school about it or pressure my son to reconsider. She thinks I'm making a big deal out of nothing and if my kid is actual curious, I could be shutting him down.  But I'm worried that it's actually a very big deal for the transgender student and her family.

This could cause all kinds of problems...bullying, backlash from other parents, the teacher getting in trouble for encouraging it. It's not supportive at all to suggest this.  If a student is actually transgender, the gender reveal should be for them only, and why tf does it need to be done in front of the whole class?

It sounds like these kids aren't mature enough to realize what they would be telling their classmate if they follow through on their plan. They think it's silly, but for her it's important to be able to say she's a she. The teacher should have realized this would happen with a bunch of 10 year olds, and you definitely need to speak with her ASAP to avoid a potentially devastating moment for the trans child. The teacher had good intentions, but this was poorly executed. Your son cannot go through with this - at best, he'll look back on this moment and cringe at how cruel a \"joke\" this is, and at worst, he could really hurt that girl and tell her he sees everything she has and will go through to assert her identity as something that can be mocked.\n\nYou absolutely need to intervene by stopping your son from doing this and alerting the teacher.

The trans kid\u2019s gender identity isn\u2019t a prank, and there are really only two possible outcomes here: either the other kids think this is hysterical and it becomes legend, to the unending mortification of the trans kid, *or* the joke falls flat and your son and his friend are now branded as transphobic bullies.  He could get in official trouble, too.\n\nOr both, depending who you ask - no reason this couldn\u2019t split the class.\n\nI would normally not suggest ignoring a spouse\u2019s input, but if she won\u2019t budge, you need to act anyway.

She stopped, looked at me, and said \u201cThank you for calling it a dress, and not a costume.\u201d\n\nThe same principle applies here; doing something sincerely and recognizing the appropriate context/meaning of an action is great! Trivializing it is not appropriate. \n\nYou can by all means sit down with your son and talk about whether or not he is questioning his gender identity, and reiterate that to do so is perfectly fine!

Good for her, I'm all for people being who they are. Now, his teacher, in an effort to be supportive, is planning a \"gender reveal\" themed party for the class. The idea is that any kid who wants to can \"reveal\" their chosen gender, not just the transgender student. Meaning, the boys declare as boys and the girls (and the trans student declare as girls).  I think this is a dumb idea, but that's not a hill I'm going to die on.\n\nHere is the problem -- my son and his female friend both want to do gender reveals as the opposite gender for \"fun\". They're not transgender, they're not questioning their identities, they just think it's a cool party trick. My wife says it's harmless and tells me to let it go. I'm struggling though. I can't help but think that doing a \"fake\" reveal could be incredibly disrespectful to the transgender student and her family. It also has me thinking that the whole thing is inappropriate.\n\nMy wife is adamant that I shouldn't talk to the school about it or pressure my son to reconsider. She thinks I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but I'm worried that it's actually a very big deal for the transgender student and her family. The parents of the trans kid are very involved in the school and that also makes things socially hard for us.

Isn't that the point? That we just let kids identify how they want? That's pandora's box and it's been opened.

The title made me believe you were against the trans community but this turned out to be the opposite.  \n\nNTA your son may think it\u2019s fun or funny but it\u2019s not always the case. This poor girl finally got the courage to come out seeing other students do it can either look like wow I have more people like me or seen as being made fun of.", "What if you just informed the teacher ahead of time what your son and his friend plan on doing? Just be like 'Hey I don't know if this would be like disrespectful to the trans student or whatever but maybe it's best to let you know that my son is planning...\" - then if it is a problem, I don't know, at least you told them what was going to happen. \n\nThen hope the teacher doesn't tell your son that you contacted them. If the teacher does tell your son just be like \"Well I didn't know what to do!\" and run out of the room.", "NTA - you are being respectful of the Trans community.  The teacher is trying to be supportive of the student,  but it is misguided and not fully thought through. I would talk to administration and voice concerns about students not taking the reveal seriously.", "OP NTA, I myself identify as nonbinary, and as someone else said in the comments (in summary of their trans child) you are absolutely the type of person I would want to have in my life as an ally. And with your son, I absolutely understand children  don\u2019t always fully understand the things that they joke about (I had kids at the middle school I attended joke about night time workers if you know what I mean, even though we chances are most of us at that age didn\u2019t fully comprehend what that type of work comes with at that point). So I am grateful that you want to teach your son why this sort of topic isn\u2019t something to joke about. And as a cna, if you do have a conversation with your son about it, as a cna as well, I recommend trying to put it in his perspective as to why comments like that hurt our community. Like for example, I\u2019m left handed and once got called stupid by a fellow (at that point in time) middle school student because I\u2019m not right handed. Something similar in the way of like if your son wears glasses, ask how it would make him feel if someone teased or made jokes about it to him. At any age being treated definitely doesn\u2019t fell good. And with the teacher, I understand wanting to help the kids try and start learning about different gender identities. However I think her plan of action in doing so is wildly weird and I know the intent is good on the teachers part, it would probably make me very uncomfortable having all that attention like that. And especially with other kids, it would definitely set up the transgender child to potentially be treated and bullied by classmates. So in her case is say slightly the AH. However with your wife, even if she doesn\u2019t have issue with your son making that sort of thing, it\u2019s 2023, somebody would definitely take offense to your son making jokes like that. And I definitely wouldn\u2019t want your son to have someone come at them sideways for taking offense either! So I\u2019d say she\u2019s also slightly the AH. And with that, please do what you can to teach him why those sort of jokes can hurt people, with it being 2023, you never know what could happen if someone takes offense to something. And I genuinely wouldn\u2019t want anything to happen to your son. And please contact the school to tell them you\u2019ve heard students talking about making jokes about and seeing you could be done about it!", "NTA, but coming from a trans adult who came out in high school, this is a valuable teaching moment. \n\nTake the time to sit down with your kid and explain that peoples identities aren't a joke and why it can be seen as harmful for them to do something like that.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you\u2019re trying to be respectful of the classmate and her feelings.

It's one thing for transfolks to have their own coming out parties, but this seems too performative on BEHALF of students (that may or may not include their input).\n\nOn top of that, the teacher is then \"encouraging\" students to come out as their gender. This can be good and bad - again, celebrating differences is great!

How does one go through with it in this fucking economy?!!\n\nBut yeah. I guess being a kid in the 90\u2019s was different. Never had the actual urge to become male, but was a total tomboy and renounced my femininity and delicateness~ and got into softball and kicked some ass!", "I mean no 10 year old will know theyre pan & NB", "No. And I was in high school in the mid-90s. Kids identify with gender from preschool. They're grouped by gender all the time. By 5th, they're all about crushes and most have begun puberty (5th grade classes in the spring smell RIPE). Your body changing from a child to an adult will bring about gender identity questions no matter what."]}
