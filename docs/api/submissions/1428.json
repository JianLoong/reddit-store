We're starting to pick up on each other's everyday habits and one of his is: he is on his phone like 80% of the time. \n\nSometimes we'll be in bed, not having sex just getting ready to sleep, and he'll open his phone to watch something. Sometimes he notices that Imm just laying there and he closes his phone and pulls me towards him. It's cute but i just wish it would happens quicker not after I've been sitting there with a blank face. He isn't doing anything sneaky (trust me, I've seen it) he just likes to play chess, or browse Twitter, watch videos, etc etc. It doesn't get in the way of sex or our personal connection time, none of that. Just that when he wakes up he grabs his phone and will sometimes run late due to scrolling for 40 mins.. or if we're in the kitchen, or he's in the bathroom.. makes me feel like a video is more interesting than talking to me. \n\nNot to discreet him or anything, he is incredibly helpful around the house, he washes the dishes and cooks breakfast for the both of us, sometimes cooks dinner, he is so great but this habit irks me. \n\n I get watching a funny video here and there but it is seemingly never ending with him. \n\nI'm also concerned because it is getting in the way of him getting tasks done, or not wanting to get up because he's on his phone.. or running late, which means I have to leave my desk and rush helping him do everything (I WFH) \n\nI don't expect us to be fully engaged 24/7 but, I'm genuinely concerned and want to help him. I want to also understand why he constantly needs media stimulation. It makes me feel like I'm not stimulating enough.

It's not about you, so don't make it about you. We live in a place and time where the entirety of the world's knowledge and entertainment is in a tiny device in our pocket at all times and some people are just more prone to use it than others.  \n\n\nWhether or not you understand it is irrelevant; you are not him, he is not you and thus your personal feelings about and habits surrounding using a phone aren't the same and that's okay. You don't need to frame it as \"I'm worried about him\" because people being on their phones a lot in 2022 is completely normal. At the end of the day, you're feeling insecure and the only person who can work on that is you; don't make the mistake of subconsciously villainizing your partner and their commonplace habits in lieu of working on your feelings of insecurity, jealousy, etc.  \n\n\nIt's perfectly fine to have the conversation of \"if we've got somewhere to be/something that needs to be done, sit the phone down until that's dealt with,\" but it doesn't need to be anything more than that.", "YWBTA - if you went online about it rather than talking to him about it in person.

If it's not getting in the way of your sex life and he helps out, what's the issue?\n\nNarcissistic if you expect him to be fully focused on you every waking moment of his day.", "YTA.
