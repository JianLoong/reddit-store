{"id": 18706, "submission_id": "13xj0ym", "title": "AITA for not backing up my husband when he grounded our daughter?", "selftext": "Background: our daughter (10) has a condition known as ARFID - avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. She also has anxiety and ADHD and is a high maintenance child. She is in therapy and on meds, but the food issue has not gotten better. She has panic attacks when you ask her to eat something new. (And before someone says not to feed her and she will eventually eat...that doesn't work. She will just not eat all day. This is an actual psychiatric disorder.) \n\nMy husband made a deal with her recently. If she tries any food he asks her to for 2 weeks, she can get a new kitten. This is a bet that he won't lose, her anxiety and fear over food is too great. But she did try a few new foods. But then one will trigger her anxiety and she will panic and then have to start over. I am fine with this, even though I had no input into the deal. The furthest she made it was 2.5 days and then he asked her to try oatmeal, which she did, but then spit it out and he wouldn't let it count if she didn't swallow it. She couldn't bring herself to take another bite. I was iffy about that, but it was his deal with her so his rules. \n\nToday he asked her to try a peanut which she has tried before and hates. She freaked out because she already knows she can't stand the texture and was afraid she would puke. Instead of starting over, today he threatened to ground her. She was already in panic mode and melted down. I was upstairs WFH, and she runs up to me in tears. I hadn't heard all of what happened downstairs, so thought she must have yelled at her dad or been rude. She said no, it was just that she wouldn't try the peanut. I don't remember exactly what I said, but basically I didn't think grounding was fair in this case if her side of the story was accurate. Well, this pissed my hubby off, and even though he confirmed that it was only because of her refusal, he started yelling at me for not backing him up, because we have to \"be a team.\" I don't feel like him unilaterally deciding she is grounded is a team to begin with. I don't think I should have to back him up when I disagree with him - I feel I should stick up for my daughter. I don't agree with grounding/yelling about the food issues, because it never works, only making the situation worse. It's going to make it a negative experience in her mind and she will never like any food that she's made to try that way. \n\nSo, AITA for agreeing with my daughter that her dad wasn't being fair? She is still grounded at this point, I didn't undo it. If it makes a difference, he did agree after our argument that I made valid points, but thinks I should've agreed with him in front of her and then discussed it with him later. (Which wouldn't have made a difference, he wouldn't have reversed it because then she wouldn't respect him for going back on his word.) Of course, him yelling at me for not backing him up was also done in front of our daughter.", "created_utc": 1685629682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xj0ym/aita_for_not_backing_up_my_husband_when_he/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's dangling a carrot she is incapable, at this moment, of reaching. \n\nThe grounding is also gross and terrible, but all of it is secondary to the emotional damage he is inflicting on your daughter.

Having also had a kid with feeding issues, I very much doubt anyone with any education in her disorder would have given him approval for this idiotic scheme.

You are blurring the lines between parenting and providing medical healthcare. You are treating this as if it is something willful that you can coax or coerce into submission. But you can't.

Encourage them to try new things, but stay silent if they don't. Negativity, punishments, and threats will worsen their anxiety and increase their likelihood of panicking. \n\nIf your husband won't step back, you need to put your foot down.

He can't have it both ways.\n\nI disagree with the \"deal\" he made with your daughter, since the deck is so stacked on his side. All he has to do is ask her to eat a food he *knows* she hates, and she loses. I think you should have intervened before now when you saw he was taking unfair advantage.

She is only grounded from the computer for the rest of the day. So there is still plenty she can do. I would undo it, but it would cause so much more problems with hubby than it is worth. \n\n2. We already have four cats. So we don't really need another one. My husband didn't expect her to make it 2 weeks, but will honor the deal if she could because it would be \"worth it.\"\n\n3. While she has an official diagnosis, it's hard to find a specialist for it. She has mainly been working with her therapist on her self-esteem, anxiety and ADHD. Most of the programs are not covered by insurance and far away. There is one that she wasn't eligible for until she was 10 that I need to look into. But most eating disorder places are for anorexia and bulimia, this condition isn't as well studied yet.\n\n4. She will panic if we put a new food anywhere on her plate. We have gotten to the point where we can ask her to try it and she will say \"no thank you\" rather than freak out, which is progress. \n\n5. Hubby is mainly worried for her health and willing to try anything at this point. Her diet is very limited. No veggies. Only fruit is apples. (If they are sweet and have no brown spots.) Very little meat, basically only if it is breaded and she can't see the actual meat. She eats a lot of spaghettios, chicken nuggets and pizza. She does like yogurt and for some strange reason, loves Grape Nuts, so it's not all completely unhealthy things. \n\n6. I was a picky eater as a child, but not to this extreme. You know how your parent will say \"I hope you get a kid just like you!\" That's what happened but her pickiness is 10x worse.
