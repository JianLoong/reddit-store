{"id": 18706, "submission_id": "13xj0ym", "title": "AITA for not backing up my husband when he grounded our daughter?", "selftext": "Background: our daughter (10) has a condition known as ARFID - avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. She also has anxiety and ADHD and is a high maintenance child. She is in therapy and on meds, but the food issue has not gotten better. She has panic attacks when you ask her to eat something new. (And before someone says not to feed her and she will eventually eat...that doesn't work. She will just not eat all day. This is an actual psychiatric disorder.) \n\nMy husband made a deal with her recently. If she tries any food he asks her to for 2 weeks, she can get a new kitten. This is a bet that he won't lose, her anxiety and fear over food is too great. But she did try a few new foods. But then one will trigger her anxiety and she will panic and then have to start over. I am fine with this, even though I had no input into the deal. The furthest she made it was 2.5 days and then he asked her to try oatmeal, which she did, but then spit it out and he wouldn't let it count if she didn't swallow it. She couldn't bring herself to take another bite. I was iffy about that, but it was his deal with her so his rules. \n\nToday he asked her to try a peanut which she has tried before and hates. She freaked out because she already knows she can't stand the texture and was afraid she would puke. Instead of starting over, today he threatened to ground her. She was already in panic mode and melted down. I was upstairs WFH, and she runs up to me in tears. I hadn't heard all of what happened downstairs, so thought she must have yelled at her dad or been rude. She said no, it was just that she wouldn't try the peanut. I don't remember exactly what I said, but basically I didn't think grounding was fair in this case if her side of the story was accurate. Well, this pissed my hubby off, and even though he confirmed that it was only because of her refusal, he started yelling at me for not backing him up, because we have to \"be a team.\" I don't feel like him unilaterally deciding she is grounded is a team to begin with. I don't think I should have to back him up when I disagree with him - I feel I should stick up for my daughter. I don't agree with grounding/yelling about the food issues, because it never works, only making the situation worse. It's going to make it a negative experience in her mind and she will never like any food that she's made to try that way. \n\nSo, AITA for agreeing with my daughter that her dad wasn't being fair? She is still grounded at this point, I didn't undo it. If it makes a difference, he did agree after our argument that I made valid points, but thinks I should've agreed with him in front of her and then discussed it with him later. (Which wouldn't have made a difference, he wouldn't have reversed it because then she wouldn't respect him for going back on his word.) Of course, him yelling at me for not backing him up was also done in front of our daughter.", "created_utc": 1685629682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xj0ym/aita_for_not_backing_up_my_husband_when_he/", "score": 787, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are blurring the lines between parenting and providing medical healthcare. You are treating this as if it is something willful that you can coax or coerce into submission. But you can't.

Encourage them to try new things, but stay silent if they don't. Negativity, punishments, and threats will worsen their anxiety and increase their likelihood of panicking. \n\nIf your husband won't step back, you need to put your foot down.

He can't have it both ways.\n\nI disagree with the \"deal\" he made with your daughter, since the deck is so stacked on his side. All he has to do is ask her to eat a food he *knows* she hates, and she loses. I think you should have intervened before now when you saw he was taking unfair advantage.

While she has an official diagnosis, it's hard to find a specialist for it. She has mainly been working with her therapist on her self-esteem, anxiety and ADHD. Most of the programs are not covered by insurance and far away. There is one that she wasn't eligible for until she was 10 that I need to look into. But most eating disorder places are for anorexia and bulimia, this condition isn't as well studied yet.\n\n4. She will panic if we put a new food anywhere on her plate. We have gotten to the point where we can ask her to try it and she will say \"no thank you\" rather than freak out, which is progress. \n\n5. Hubby is mainly worried for her health and willing to try anything at this point. Her diet is very limited. No veggies. Only fruit is apples. (If they are sweet and have no brown spots.) Very little meat, basically only if it is breaded and she can't see the actual meat. She eats a lot of spaghettios, chicken nuggets and pizza. She does like yogurt and for some strange reason, loves Grape Nuts, so it's not all completely unhealthy things. \n\n6. I was a picky eater as a child, but not to this extreme. You know how your parent will say \"I hope you get a kid just like you!\" That's what happened but her pickiness is 10x worse.

Just because I understand does not excuse her inactions. She left him when I was an adult, AFTER the damage had been done. Im not saying divorce him now, but make it clear that he shapes up or you and the kids are out of there. The ONLY thing you are doing right in this scenario is not lashing out at your child.

Which two want to be friends? You get to pick the two, then you decide how much of each and put them together on the fork/spoon, and eat them together. It really helps my daughter eat more broccoli (her favorite veg), versus eating it by itself. And then there are foods that are pre-buddied, like spaghetti with red sauce. Once you're comfortable buddying food, then you can use it to help you get more familiar with less preferred foods. Perhaps there's a buddy food for... apples... that makes them consumable. \n\nThe other strategy you might want to try is where you change the appearance of a food slightly. It's the exact same food, but it looks just a bit different. Green food coloring added to some mac and cheese. Cut the hot dot into strips instead of coins. This one helps us get un-stuck from the \"I only eat this one kind of yogurt/mac and cheese/whatever\" that is dangerous when there are supply chain issues. (Seriously, my kid likes exactly one flavor of yogurt and it's the Target in-house brand. She eats zero fruits and 1-2 vegetables. Yogurt is necessary.) And if you can get brave about a food looking different, maybe you can be brave about food in another way.\n\nWe do talk a lot about what a food is like, but she mostly shuts down if she's decided it's scary. I completely understand her reaction, as it is mine also on occasion, but as an adult I have ways to talk to myself or trick myself so I can have a broader food experience. Also her knowledge/experience is limited, so there's not always something we can compare it to. Hence bringing in a psychologist. Unfortunately there's a 4-5 month waiting list for that. \n\nI really enjoy talking about feeding therapy and all that we've learned, if you can't tell. :) It's been a really good experience, even though it's been slow and a huge commitment. We have a long term goal in mind; we weren't expecting quick results. We just need her to be able to go to kindergarten and not starve. \n\nIt sounds like you've found some good strategies that work for you and are managing. I love that you asked about buddy foods - it shows that you're open to change and trying to explore the world of food, versus just giving in and only eating plain chicken breast sandwiches and carrots (having known adults who have ridiculously limited foods they will order at restaurants, this was a real person).

It made me wonder if I was even really being abused or if all parents hit their children so this was normal. Then, when I finally decided that being smacked around wasn't normal, it made me wonder why I wasn't worth protecting.\n\nIn the end, the physical harm healed a lot faster than the mental/emotional harm they caused me.

ARFID can be really annoying to live with, both for the person who has it and the people caring for them. It took a long time for my family and I to find a way that works for us.\n\nYou need to talk to your husband about how he views her eating disorder because it is not the same as being picky. Forcing her to eat foods she dislikes could be like him asking her to stick her hand in fire, your body will physically try to stop you.

What she needs is support and what your husband is doing is not that.\n\nThe thing you need to target is not the eating itself but her anxiety and overall mental health. The better she is mentally the easier it is to eat new foods. The most important thing is that your daughter eats something.

Get some vitamins to help make sure her nutritional needs are met, but otherwise let her eat the things that make her comfortable. You can buy foods that are easy for a 10yo to prepare and she will eat so that if she cannot eat what is prepared for dinner she doesn't go hungry. If you find she's only eating one specific thing, try and improve her mental health.\n\nI would suggest looking at ARFID less as a \"picky eater\" issue and more as a food allergy.

But I'm taking the gamble because she chose to come to a sub for judgement instead of a support sub. \n\nI'm not particularly upset so I wouldn't say I'm triggered. But I did speak bluntly because OP is an adult who needs to know the consequences of her actions in order to be judged as per the point of this sub.\n\nAnd not every abuse victim becomes an abuser in turn. The cycle of abuse means they themselves may fall into abuse, BUT not necessarily that they'll choose to have a child that they'll then choose to watch be abused. When that does happen, the victim is no longer *just* a victim because now they're complicit in someone else's abuse. OP isn't just a victim anymore. That's why I voted ESH, she is now complicit in abuse instead of merely being victimized herself.", "Reddit is the absolute worst place for OP right now.", "Yeah she should he home while her husband yells and forces his daughter to eat food that literally makes her vomit doing nothing.", "YTA for allowing your husband to bully, scare and intimidate your daughter. She is dealing with a very serious and crippling disorder. I also have a high-needs child and would never allow anyone to treat them this way. When my then husband refused to change and learn how to adapt and properly parent our son I left him. Granted this is a hard-earned perspective I have developed. But these kids NEED someone undoubtedly in their corner. One mother to another (and I don\u2019t mean to sound too harsh) you need to step-up for your daughter. Be tough and firm with everyone who would have her feel ashamed or needing to mask her true self. There is nothing wrong with who she is. She does not need to be fixed, she needs her family to love her for who she is.", "NTA, please stick up for your daughter OP. Dad is emotionally abusing her whether or not he realizes it.", "ESH\n\nRun this \u201cdeal\u201d by your child\u2019s therapist. They can tell you why it\u2019s a terrible idea. Plus it will clue the therapist into the fact your husband is probably 50% of your daughter\u2019s issues, and is slowing (or preventing) her current progression. Inappropriate activities like what you\u2019ve just described are probably the tip of the iceberg of what\u2019s going on in this house. \n\nDo better.", "NTA\n\n\nI have ARFID and ADHD as well, though I'm 32. My mother forced me on multiple occasions growing up to eat food I couldn't handle to the point of me vomiting. I have never forgiven her for that or my father for letting it happen. We don't speak now even though I only live 15 minutes away. \n\n\n\nYou have a chance to remain a safe parent. Your husband? He's broken her trust BADLY. He needs to apologize to her, now and get his head out of his ass.", "NTA\n\nIt seems he realised it was not turning out the way he had planned and took that as a personal insult to his ego. Then he punished her for something beyond her control. That's cruel. \n\nI hate this 'we have to be a team, so I can do whatever I feel like and you will have to back me up'. It sends a terrible message to the child, as fairness is no part of it.\nHe is breaking his OWN rules, and expects you to back him up on that?  That is not parenting. He's saying \"You will do as I say, because I am the boss, and we outnumber you\" That is BULLYING\n\n\n>he wouldn't have reversed it because then she wouldn't respect him for going back on his word.\n\nHe would be SO WRONG!\n\nThe best thing my parents EVER did, was showing me they were able to make a mistake, realise they were wrong, and then APOLOGISE to me. I must've been 7 or 8. I still remember that happening.  I felt SO grown up and respected, and it installed a deep trust in them, because *if* they were wrong, they'd realise and act accordingly. That was priceless parenting.", "You both need to sit with her therapist and ask them to assess the situation. NTA", "NTA. Your husband needs to stop playing mind games with your child. It\u2019s toxic. He also shouldn\u2019t be yelling at you\u2014especially in front of her. You need to have a serious conversation with him and then unground her as a \u201cteam.\u201d", "NTA. I'm sorry, but at the moment your daughter is grounded because daddy's ego is hurt. \n\nThis is not an acceptable situation. \n\nDad needs to ease up on this. His behavior is massing the anxiety worse, so making her reactions worse. \n\nHis bet would have been a great idea if he could have kept it light and fun. It had the potential to really be effective. \n\nProviding a little bit of extra incentive for her to push her own anxiety feelings would have been really freaking brilliant. \n\nI'm sorry he wasn't able to manage his own emotions enough to let that work. Does he by chance also have unmanaged anxiety?", "NTA but your husband is abusing your daughter. Not all abuse is physical. He knows she has this condition, he knows what triggers her and is deliberately doing it then punishing her when she can't comply.", "ESH  \nTo be frank OP - your husband sucks and I would be shocked if your daughter has a relationship with him once she's 18. The fact you allowed this to happen past the oatmeal incident is honestly boggling.   \nI scrolled your comment history and saw how little he cares about you and your family (smoking in the family car after you've told him to stop multiple times is insane) so while I understand divorce isn't an option for everyone, he sounds like someone who deserves to be alone. Try to be a better advocate for your daughter - I'm incredibly sad for her.", "NTA\n\nI understand his frustration but grounding her for a medical condition is wrong. I suspect my daughter has arfid. The arfid subreddit is a great place to get a look at how she sees food. Around your daughter's age is when I put the responsibility of feeding herself on her. She's 13 now and rarely eats what I make for dinner. She has gotten so much better since then. Occasionally she even asks to try a new food. My only rule to that is it can't be done in an expensive restaurant. She can try our food. I will happily let her try bites of my food.", "You and your husband grounded her because of\u2026\u2026..a disability? Yeah? You\u2019re both assholes.", "Your husband is unhinged. I have adult ARFID and it makes zero sense but if you can\u2019t get it down you can\u2019t. I do think you\u2019re slightly the asshole for even allowing your husband to bother her about food, though. A huge thing with ARFID is distraction- the more you focus on it, the harder it is. He\u2019s only making it worse and her feel terrible.", "NTA and since he made the unilateral decision to ground her I Would make the unilateral decision to get her a kitten.  She tried her best. I\u2019m sure that 2.5 days was a huge accomplishment for her and she deserves a reward.\n\nSetting unrealistic goals knowing that they can\u2019t be achieved is setting her up to fail.   This isn\u2019t teaching your daughter good eating skills.  It is child abuse.", "As someone with ARFID, what your husband is doing can be traumatizing, and he is likely going to make her food aversions even worse. NTA, but if you don\u2019t put a foot down and stand up for your daughter, she will have no one advocating for her, and this will probably get much worse.", "Peanuts are a fucking nightmare for people with texture issues. They're grainy and get stuck in every crevice of your mouth and you keep finding bits of them on your tongue hours after you eat them.\nYour husband is an idiot and it's ableist as shit to freaking GROUND HER for having food issues. What on earth is he thinking? NTA keep sticking up for your daughter against this nonsense.", "ESH (except your child) What your husband is doing is abusive, and you are only condoning his abuse by letting him continue to ground her. Stick up for your daughter better. Unground her and let her know she is not bad for this. She deserves better.", "I said this in another comment but I think you need to hear it here. \n\nYou married a man exactly like your father. \n\nYou married a man willing to use his daughter as a verbal punching bag because he's \"cranky.\" \n\nYour dad yelled far more than your husband? That's not how your daughter sees it. He's punishing her for an eating disorder. That's disgusting. \n\nLet me speak now from my own experience, when I was 10 foods that I was able to eat before suddenly gave me a really bad upset stomach. My dad thought I was faking it. Demanded I eat my dinner or starve. Locked me in my bedroom for a week because I tried to explain that I physically couldn't eat it, it was making me feel ill. \n\nThat was almost two decades ago. I still remember it like it happened yesterday. I remember my mother doing nothing because she didn't want to be yelled at as well. She allowed my father to use me as a verbal punching bag because she didn't want to be in my place. It took years before I could trust her, even remotely, again. Our relationship still isn't the best. And I don't talk to my father anymore. \n\nDon't make the same mistakes my parents made. Don't let your daughter grow up in an environment where she's screamed at and punished for a eating disorder she doesn't want. Be a good mother. Please.", "Holy shit. Sweetheart, get away from him. Please. He is abusing you, he is abusing your kids. What you have just described is *abuse*.\n\nHe sounds very, very much like someone who abused me during my childhood. They made my childhood absolute hell.\n\nWhat you described him doing to your daughter with ARFID? That's not him trying to help: that's him wanting *power*. He is enjoying forcing her to do what he says, because it makes him feel powerful.\n\nThe answer to the question you're replying to? It should be \"never\". What I mean is, in a non-abusive relationship, if someone asked if you ever felt like you had to protect yourself or kids from him, the normal answer would be \"never\".  Any answer besides \"never\" - like you saying \"not often\" - means he is abusive.\n\nPlease, please, for your own sake but most especially for your children's sake (because it's obvious you love them!), DIVORCE HIM. Get them away from him. It doesn't matter if he's in therapy, it's obvious that isn't doing enough, and it's obvious that he is still causing your kids harm.  They deserve to have safe, not-scary childhoods.\n\nYou're their mom. Your job is to take care if them. To protect them.  Right now, he is hurting them, and you need to get them out if there.\n\nMy parent never got me away from the person who abused me, who was a *lot* like your husband.  My parent just watched.  I've never forgiven my parent.  I never will. Please, please be better. For your kids, and for you. \n\nMuch love to you \u2764\ufe0f", "That is a good first step. It was a tiny step, but a good one.\n\n\u2018Your next step needs to be to get away with your kids right away. That will be a giant  step.  Please leave.", "Jesus Christ that's cruel. He is *cruel*. He is delighting in hurting them.", "Your husband is sadistic and cruel and you are allowing him to treat your kids like that. Be a better parent.", "OP isn't just underreacting. She is tacitly approving his abuse and therefore participating in abusing her daughter. \n\nHer husband is sick. He is making false promises that BOTH parents know he does not intend to keep, which the daughter is ignorant of. They are BOTH using her ignorance of their cruelty to coerce her into an endless cycle of meaningless, visceral suffering that she has no idea has no hope of reward or end. Except now, because of OPs lack of action, she knows she will be forced to participate unwillingly in a sick game where she is punished if she does not entertain her father with her suffering, and she knows no one, not even her mother, will help her. Kids are smarter than you think. She probably knows somewhere this is no longer about the illusion of earning something if she pushes herself, it's about her father taking joy in watching her harm herself. OP is watching her husband actively torture their child and sitting by and doing nothing. \n\n\nOP, your daughter will never forget that you let her father do this to her. My father let my mother do the same to me as a child. I don't talk to either anymore, but I'll tell you this--I hate my father a lot more than I hate my mother.", "I'm getting \"she married a man just like her father\" vibes from this post. They might not act exactly the same, but Jesus Christ her husband is a raging asshole"]}
