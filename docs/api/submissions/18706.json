{"id": 18706, "submission_id": "13xj0ym", "title": "AITA for not backing up my husband when he grounded our daughter?", "selftext": "Background: our daughter (10) has a condition known as ARFID - avoidant restrictive food intake disorder. She also has anxiety and ADHD and is a high maintenance child. She is in therapy and on meds, but the food issue has not gotten better. She has panic attacks when you ask her to eat something new. (And before someone says not to feed her and she will eventually eat...that doesn't work. She will just not eat all day. This is an actual psychiatric disorder.) \n\nMy husband made a deal with her recently. If she tries any food he asks her to for 2 weeks, she can get a new kitten. This is a bet that he won't lose, her anxiety and fear over food is too great. But she did try a few new foods. But then one will trigger her anxiety and she will panic and then have to start over. I am fine with this, even though I had no input into the deal. The furthest she made it was 2.5 days and then he asked her to try oatmeal, which she did, but then spit it out and he wouldn't let it count if she didn't swallow it. She couldn't bring herself to take another bite. I was iffy about that, but it was his deal with her so his rules. \n\nToday he asked her to try a peanut which she has tried before and hates. She freaked out because she already knows she can't stand the texture and was afraid she would puke. Instead of starting over, today he threatened to ground her. She was already in panic mode and melted down. I was upstairs WFH, and she runs up to me in tears. I hadn't heard all of what happened downstairs, so thought she must have yelled at her dad or been rude. She said no, it was just that she wouldn't try the peanut. I don't remember exactly what I said, but basically I didn't think grounding was fair in this case if her side of the story was accurate. Well, this pissed my hubby off, and even though he confirmed that it was only because of her refusal, he started yelling at me for not backing him up, because we have to \"be a team.\" I don't feel like him unilaterally deciding she is grounded is a team to begin with. I don't think I should have to back him up when I disagree with him - I feel I should stick up for my daughter. I don't agree with grounding/yelling about the food issues, because it never works, only making the situation worse. It's going to make it a negative experience in her mind and she will never like any food that she's made to try that way. \n\nSo, AITA for agreeing with my daughter that her dad wasn't being fair? She is still grounded at this point, I didn't undo it. If it makes a difference, he did agree after our argument that I made valid points, but thinks I should've agreed with him in front of her and then discussed it with him later. (Which wouldn't have made a difference, he wouldn't have reversed it because then she wouldn't respect him for going back on his word.) Of course, him yelling at me for not backing him up was also done in front of our daughter.", "created_utc": 1685629682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xj0ym/aita_for_not_backing_up_my_husband_when_he/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Negativity, punishments, and threats will worsen their anxiety and increase their likelihood of panicking. \n\nIf your husband won't step back, you need to put your foot down.
