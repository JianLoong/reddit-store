Lately, instead of eating what I make him for lunch, he opts to buy lunch that is \u201cmore calories\u201d and claims that he\u2019ll also eat the lunch I make him later (which he constantly says he loves and is his favorite but make him too full ??). He never tells me when he buys lunch but I find out when I\u2019m home because I obviously see the trash left on the dining table. I told him how I feel about this and he claims that he eats my food too but also needs to buy lunch as well\u2026 EDIT: but he says that for days and doesn\u2019t eat it until the every last day before it\u2019s about to go bad\u2026\n\nI got so fed up with this continuous cycle that I straight up threw the rest of the lunch he didn\u2019t eat, that he said he would eat later, into the trash can right in front of him. I told him to avoid my hurt feelings and so that I don\u2019t need to waste my energy any longer, that I was never going to cook for him again. He can eat out - I don\u2019t care anymore. \n\nHe is now upset but I have been upset over this constantly. I threw the food away right in front of him to show him I sincerely mean it this time.

You only for wasting food, though. If he's expecting you to cook for him 3meals a day and also leaving his trash on the dining table, I'm guessing you do even more for him and the household even though you commute and he doesn't. \n\nTry to stand up for yourself a bit better.

Instead of getting mad about it, you could have just stopped making him lunch when it became apparent that he was not going to eat it later.  But you continued to make it and then threw a tantrum when you finally got fed up with him not eating it.\n\nHe, on the other hand, should have just told you he\u2019d get his own lunch.

It\u2019s understandable to be hurt, but the adult solution would be to tell him that even though he says he\u2019ll eat it, food keeps going bad so you\u2019re simply not going to make food for him. If he wants something he can tell you but if he decides not to eat it again you\u2019re not going to make him any more food at all. Throwing food away like that may have seemed like a way to teach him a lesson, but you need to learn how to clearly explain and follow through on your boundaries.", "You could have communicated this without any of the theater\nI understand you are upset and have reason to be, but you reacted quite like a child having a tantrum.

He\u2019s a grown man and can make his own meals.", "YTA\n\nStop trying to control him.\n\nIf you cook the food for him, it's his. Leave him TF alone already. If he eats it, ok...if he doesn't, ok.

This has applications aside from eating but YOU CANNOT MANDATE HOW HE EATS. He can literally take a bite of your food and spit it out (not in front of you at least) because it might not be what he wants to taste and it the food isn't what he deems worthy of entering his system, he can spit it out.\n\nAnd to anyone who says that this is too much and he should at least try it, I say to you, fluck off. I have the best relationship with food today compared to years ago because I've allowed myself to \"nope\" out of any food that I do not want in my system. I do not care who made it, how much it costs or how significant it is to anyone else. If I do not love the food, if I do not think it's the best for my body, if doesn't get eaten. Unless I specifically hire a nutritionist to tell me what to eat, I don't let anyone else tell me what to eat. Accept and respect that of your BF, especially if he's working on gains.", "YTA.

I feel like your grossly overreacted, when a calm conversation would have gotten a lot more solved and no food wasted. He says he loves your food, but that he's bulking up and needs more calories. Can you add more calories to the meal you make him? Or request he eat your meal first, and he can order more later if he's still hungry? It doesn't sound like he's trying to disrespect you and your effort -- he is just aiming to eat a LOT of calories and your meals alone don't seem to be enough.
