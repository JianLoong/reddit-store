You need to understand though that sometimes your efforts are not appreciated when they aren't asked for.

It is possible that he likes the idea of home cooked lunch but when it comes to eating it he decides he is in the mood for something else. \nMy advice would be stop cooking immediately unless you're cooking for yourself and cook what you enjoy. Make enough for you two to share as an evening meal of he doesn't want it take leftovers as lunch and let him sort out his own food. Re-evaluate in few weeks and if everyone is happy with the arrangement then keep it that way. If he wants changes then discuss it but don't offer your own labour unless he asks and make sure you are happy with new arrangements before agreeing to it.
