You need to understand though that sometimes your efforts are not appreciated when they aren't asked for.

It is possible that he likes the idea of home cooked lunch but when it comes to eating it he decides he is in the mood for something else. \nMy advice would be stop cooking immediately unless you're cooking for yourself and cook what you enjoy. Make enough for you two to share as an evening meal of he doesn't want it take leftovers as lunch and let him sort out his own food. Re-evaluate in few weeks and if everyone is happy with the arrangement then keep it that way. If he wants changes then discuss it but don't offer your own labour unless he asks and make sure you are happy with new arrangements before agreeing to it.

That's after already not even cooking for himself?\n\nCooking for each other can be a sweet way to show care for your partner and I know plenty relationships where that works. But in your case it seems like you're taking on the brunt of the work without any gratitude.", "I\u2019m stuck on him working from home but you\u2019re the one cooking 3 meals a day. Is he a virtual surgeon or rocket scientist? /s \n\nWhy on earth isn\u2019t he making himself lunch at the very least, if not also cooking dinner at least 3/4 nights a week? \n\nNTA and stop cooking in the first place rather than throwing food away.", "NTA....he works from home...u dont, so why the hell are you making ALL his meals????", "Assuming he still eats the breakfasts and dinners you prepare for him, the obvious idea is to stop making lunches. And maybe begin an adult conversation about this instead of acting like a child.", "Just what everyone else has said here....don't cook for him, you're not his mother. He works from home, he can cook his own meals", "Cook for yourself. If he eats, he eats. If he doesn\u2019t, the leftovers are yours. He\u2019s an adult, he\u2019ll figure it out", "NTA and sign him up for a cooking course or something. Dude needs to learn to make things for himself.", "NTA. \n\nShould have dared him to eat that tuna then and there though.", "Stop cooking for him then. Seriously, he wants the calories, but says your food makes him \u201ctoo full\u201d. I don\u2019t understand except, he wants junk/fast food I guess. Besides, why are you cooking all damn day and night. Can\u2019t he cook?", "> Why are you wasting your time and food making this grown ass adult's lunch? \n\nNot only that:\n\n>He never tells me when he buys lunch but I find out when I\u2019m home because I obviously see **the trash left on the dining table**\n\nThat would drive me insane! OP... Stop making your relationship unbalanced! Y'all need to do an equal amount of choirs", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Thank God OP isn't married yet.", "[removed]", "> Why are you wasting your time and food making this grown ass adult's lunch?\n\nCome on, lots of people do this for their spouse, it's not the issue here at all if he were eating it normally and thankful for it. Seriously do you guys even like people you are with?", "She\u2019ll lose her 5ct pear cut engagement ring (ratio 1.62) that she can\u2019t stop bragging about if she does that!", "Exactly!", "Not just his lunch but all of his meals", "Yep, the fact that he doesn't even clear up after his own ass also jumped out at me.   \nSpoiled little pumped up body builder who thinks she is his personal slave.  \nOP is NTA", "Lol I wouldn't even do it if he asks. They both work. The bf from home. He doesn't appreciate her efforts. He can make his own damn food!", "And stop cleaning behind him. Let him clean his own trash.", "Exactly! Why to make a scene out of it if you can simply stop cooking? Less work to do - more free time. \nAnd yeah he could just say he doesn\u2019t want her food.", "He leaves it in the fridge for days and eats it right before it\u2019s about to go bad", "Don't dump food, dump the adult man who you are raising as a spoiled brat with money to spend.\n\nI would say Y-T-A for staying with someone who can't even cook a BREAKFAST for himself, never CLEAN after himself leaving his trash around and makes you waste food. \nHe will never change OP, after you he will have another one making his meals and run after him cleaning his trash.", "That stood out to me too. He just leaves the trash on the table? Like he's too inconsiderate to even throw out the trash and leave it smelling up the place."]}
