They texted me and said they called off work because their 3 year old is sick. So I felt bad.

I get that kids get sick all the time. And my kids have been sick multiple times and I obviously informed them but I still watched their kids.

I have been watching their kids for some months now. I volunteered. I do get paid. Just recently they got sick with Covid and everyone in my house got sick. \n\nMy 3 year old is still coughing so bad they throw up and my 1 year old still has a cough as well, just not as bad. They texted me and said they called off work because their 3 year old is up since 3 am puking with a fever. So I felt bad because they\u2019re already stressed that they might lose their job for calling off. But anyway I ended up asking if they could find someone else to watch the kids for a day or two because I don\u2019t want my kids getting more sick. \n\nThey said it was fine and they get it but I asked if they were mad at me and now they won\u2019t answer me. I get that kids get sick all the time. And my kids have been sick multiple times and I obviously informed them but I still watched their kids. But it\u2019s a constant thing now since may of 2023 they are always sick. And I just want it ease up a little bit. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Especially with covid. \n\nA lot of people in the world have taken the stance of \u201cwe have vaccines now it\u2019s all good\u201d but people are still being hospitalised or dying from it. Much less than before, but it still happens. I cancelled my birthday bbq 2 weeks ago because I was exposed to it (luckily didn\u2019t catch it) but the knowledge that I could have passed it on to others if they visited was enough for me. Not worth the suffering.\n\nAnd as someone else said, a childcare centre would reject her kids if they were sick. You\u2019re not the solution for this event."]}
