{"id": 21593, "submission_id": "14tdw1n", "title": "AITA for calling my sister-in-law and brother whores after my sister-in-law insulted both me and my wife?", "selftext": "My wife \\[34F\\] and I \\[47M\\] are staying with my parents \\[72F & 71M\\], grandma \\[90F\\], older brother \\[50M\\], brother-in-law \\[48M\\], their kids \\[10F & 7M\\], younger brother \\[40M\\], sister-in-law \\[38F\\], and their kids \\[9M, 7F, & 4M\\] at a beach house we rented for 2 weeks. \n\nI should preface this by saying that frankly, I do not get along with my younger brother (\"Tod\") and I do not like my sister-in-law (\"Anne\"). That said, I am civil with them and while I don't see them often, I do love my niece and nephews. Yesterday, my wife (\"Alice\") and I were babysitting all of our nieces and nephews while my grandma napped and everyone else went to see a movie. \n\nNow, once we got here, Alice and I had baked cookies for everyone to eat. We'd baked them later in the evening, and Anne (who works as a personal trainer) told her kids that they couldn't have any. The kids were upset, of course (especially since their cousins were allowed cookies), but Anne was insistent that they weren't allowed any at the time. She and Tod are generally quite strict with the kids' diets (none of them have any food allergies), and to my recollection they have only been allowed a popsicle once this past week. While everyone was out, one of the kids asked Alice if they could have cookies, and so we gave them all some cookies to enjoy. \n\nWhen everyone came home, Anne asked the kids what they did, and one of them mentioned that we gave them cookies. She then told them to play on the beach, where they were watched by my older brother and brother-in-law and were joined by their cousins. \n\nAnne then proceeded to get very mad. She started off just saying that we shouldn't have given them cookies because she hadn't said they could have them. Alice started to apologize and say we just wanted to let them enjoy their vacation, but Anne interrupted her and told her that \"she didn't trust a fat ass with \\[her kids'\\] health.\" \n\nNow, I was absolutely livid, and I told her to shut the fuck up. The argument spiraled from there, and at one point Anne said she should never have trusted two \"psychos\" with her kids (Alice and I met in a therapy group 11 years ago after we were discharged from the hospital for mental health concerns - though I'd like to emphasize we weren't there for anything that would ever even imply that we'd put anyone else in danger).\n\nI then told her that it was rich for two whores to think that they could ever raise morally-healthy kids (Anne was originally Tod's \"best friend's\" wife, but the two had an affair, during which their oldest child was conceived, then Anne and her husband had what sounds like a rather messy divorce). \n\nShe then started crying and left, and our family is a bit divided over this. I realize that I was very harsh, but so was she and I do not think it was her place to dish out what she couldn't take.

Not having a cookie wouldn\u2019t have ruined their vacation, adults calling each other names and crying definitely would, YTA", "Tbh no sweets before dinner is a pretty common rule imo. Like would you feed a vegetarian kid some meat without asking mom and dad since it was unfair the other kids got hot dogs? Or feed someones kid whose family practiced Ramadan during that period? They are living a lifestyle they have chosen for their family to live ,It's not up to you to decide what someone else's kid eats or doesn't eat. Like how would you feel if your brother and SIL started shoving their strict food rules at your kids because they felt it was unfair that your kids lived (in their opinion) unhealthy eating habits? They didn't ask you to make it \"fair\" by not giving the other kids cookies.\n\nYou've taken the \"well my kids do it so it's fine\" but put something else in that spot and see if you'd appreciate it. They go to a friend's house whose parents let them drink alcohol, their parents ask you and you say you are uncomfortable with YOUR kid drinking at that age. Then you hear that they let the kid sip wine behind your back. Is it ok?", "they already denied you and you did it anyways.", "Nothing changes parents minds on your authority like tormenting their children repeatedly for extended periods of time. Those parents will sure learn their lesson about fairness and who is being the most nice to their children. /S", "True, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s cookies. That doesn\u2019t warrant the behaviour of SIL fat shaming OP\u2019s wife and bringing up their past mental health issues, which is just so low to do that.", "I know you have repeated this, but I actually love this response. Kind of evil, but kind of fitting.", "What if OPs SIL said that her kids can\u2019t have cookies every 20-30 seconds because she doesn\u2019t want the to be fat like OPs wife? That would get the same message across right?", "Hopefully you and your wife learn the same lesson. Respect others parenting choices.", ">When they were allowed a treat \n\nFurther INFO- What kind of treat are we talking about? Also, has your sister had these rules regarding snacks in the past?", "Anne did.", "SIL implied it during the argument.\n\n> at one point Anne said she should never have trusted two \"psychos\" with her kids", "That's fair, and to be clear I recognize that I shouldn't have let the kids have cookies (though I do stand by it being quite unfair to them).", "I respect that assessment, I'm just clarifying that I didn't insult her for her feeling that she can't trust us with the kids, I insulted her for making completely uncalled for insults.", "And I'm not refuting that. I'm refuting that her insults were, realistically, in any way connected to that.", "Fair enough. I still think that the downright cruel insults were worse than giving the kids cookies - especially since my wife was apologizing and I would have in the moment too - but I concede that I shouldn't have let any of the kids have cookies.", "Popsicles. And I don't really know, they don't seem to be quite so strict for Christmas, but admittedly we've never spent an extended period of time together with all the kids either.", "Just because you think something is unfair doesn't mean you get to override someone elses decision, especially when it's not your business.  \n\n\nI think it's unfair my coworker has a widescreen and I don't, yet you don't see me stealing one.", "But that\u2019s sort of the point here. \n\nYou chose to \u201cbe brave\u201d and let the kids have some fun that their parents wouldn\u2019t approve of. \n\nYou don\u2019t then ALSO get to be butt hurt that they disapprove and act like AHs. \n\nYou should have been prepared to be the bigger person given you chose to wind them up. \n\nSo they were definitely AHs, both for being too restrictive with their kids on holiday and for being rude to you guys. But you CHOSE to put yourself in the line of fire; so ESH.", "Insults weren't ok, but you certainly are not trustworthy. They are now questioning how much sugar you've slipped them while you watched the kids, and you clearly do not see it as a big deal. Was this the first time you trampled the boundary or did you get caught slipping them treats before? Yes the insults were downright cruel, and so were yours. But you made the first asshole move.", "So you and your wife knew the kids could have popsicles, but you gave them cookies instead, not knowing they were not allowed? Am I following correctly?", "I think it\u2019s unfair that some people are starving to death and I\u2019m not, yet you don\u2019t see me feeding them. /s", "Really you should have just taken the heat and apologized profusely.", "Certainly not trustworthy? That is such a reach. What a fragile world you live in.", "Yes, they asked for cookies, so that's what we gave them.", "\ud83e\udd72"]}
