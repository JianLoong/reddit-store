{"id": 21593, "submission_id": "14tdw1n", "title": "AITA for calling my sister-in-law and brother whores after my sister-in-law insulted both me and my wife?", "selftext": "My wife \\[34F\\] and I \\[47M\\] are staying with my parents \\[72F & 71M\\], grandma \\[90F\\], older brother \\[50M\\], brother-in-law \\[48M\\], their kids \\[10F & 7M\\], younger brother \\[40M\\], sister-in-law \\[38F\\], and their kids \\[9M, 7F, & 4M\\] at a beach house we rented for 2 weeks. \n\nI should preface this by saying that frankly, I do not get along with my younger brother (\"Tod\") and I do not like my sister-in-law (\"Anne\"). That said, I am civil with them and while I don't see them often, I do love my niece and nephews. Yesterday, my wife (\"Alice\") and I were babysitting all of our nieces and nephews while my grandma napped and everyone else went to see a movie. \n\nNow, once we got here, Alice and I had baked cookies for everyone to eat. We'd baked them later in the evening, and Anne (who works as a personal trainer) told her kids that they couldn't have any. The kids were upset, of course (especially since their cousins were allowed cookies), but Anne was insistent that they weren't allowed any at the time. She and Tod are generally quite strict with the kids' diets (none of them have any food allergies), and to my recollection they have only been allowed a popsicle once this past week. While everyone was out, one of the kids asked Alice if they could have cookies, and so we gave them all some cookies to enjoy. \n\nWhen everyone came home, Anne asked the kids what they did, and one of them mentioned that we gave them cookies. She then told them to play on the beach, where they were watched by my older brother and brother-in-law and were joined by their cousins. \n\nAnne then proceeded to get very mad. She started off just saying that we shouldn't have given them cookies because she hadn't said they could have them. Alice started to apologize and say we just wanted to let them enjoy their vacation, but Anne interrupted her and told her that \"she didn't trust a fat ass with \\[her kids'\\] health.\" \n\nNow, I was absolutely livid, and I told her to shut the fuck up. The argument spiraled from there, and at one point Anne said she should never have trusted two \"psychos\" with her kids (Alice and I met in a therapy group 11 years ago after we were discharged from the hospital for mental health concerns - though I'd like to emphasize we weren't there for anything that would ever even imply that we'd put anyone else in danger).\n\nI then told her that it was rich for two whores to think that they could ever raise morally-healthy kids (Anne was originally Tod's \"best friend's\" wife, but the two had an affair, during which their oldest child was conceived, then Anne and her husband had what sounds like a rather messy divorce). \n\nShe then started crying and left, and our family is a bit divided over this. I realize that I was very harsh, but so was she and I do not think it was her place to dish out what she couldn't take.

We only have OP's (obviously biased) word to go on, which may even be 3rdhand information from a child who just wanted more snacks. Unless OP was told by the parents that they'd only allowed their kids one popsicle as a treat all week and no other sweets, how would they even know?\n\nPossibly the kids had already had snacks before going over there, or possibly the mom had plans for later and didn't want them to overdo it.

It seems wildly inappropriate to blame OP and his partner as deserving of being ridiculed for their weight and mental health for simply giving a treat to literal children.

He was allowed to do whatever, including screaming profanities in the living room on the Xbox. He was 8 and around there. \n\nOnce he said some really vile shit.

Couldn't bother having a discussion but instead lashed out personally? Pretty sure the kids will be more impacted by that stupidity then the fucking cookie.", "Finally someone with common sense\u2026I was thinking ESH but the fact OP thinks he\u2019s owed an apology for the mess he created is wild.

I'm sure I have positive experiences with my father. I'm told all the time about good experiences we shared, but I can't remember one. I can only remember him giving me diet shakes, telling me I wasn't allowed to have almonds cuz they were too high in calories. \n\nI remember when I was worried my mother was relapsing her eating disorder when she got a diet app (she didn't know it was a diet app when she got it, but once she has it she just couldn't turn it off, compulsively weighing everything, even things like grapes and cucumbers) and when I told him I was worried about her, he told me I was trying to sabotage her because I was jealous. Treating your kids like this will erase every good memory they've ever had of you.", "A cookie? Seriously?", "To be fair, the fact that they instantly went to bodyshame on top of not allowing their kids to have any cookies does not exactly inspire great confidence in their relationship with food or how they deal with it with respect to their kids.", " Fostering disordered eating doesn't just mean severe restriction - it can also mean teaching kids that some foods are good or bad, or some bodies are good or bad, or just having strict rules around food that aren't based on allergies or need. \n\n\nHer big reaction and immediately escalating to body shaming is a pretty giant red flag.", "I was wondering the same thing. I went back to re-read because I thought I missed something. \n\nHonestly I\u2019ve noticed that because so many people eat a lot of sweets, fatty foods, junk etc they get bothered by others who eat a minimal amount or want their kids to eat a minimal and start projecting and trying to brand them as wrong or unhealthy.", "No one said severely restricting food intake.

Basically I\u2019ve a terrible relationship with food, sugar, I don\u2019t want that for my kids, it\u2019s gotten to the point where the oldest at the time would have an upset tummy due to being spoiled.

They were 'only' allowed one popsicle so far that week. How many popsicles are you out there feeding your kids? One per week is totally fine, healthy even. \n\n2. OP is apparently overweight (or the insult wouldn't have made sense). \n\n3. SIL is a personal trainer and also apparently pretty elitist and hostile about size/weight. \n\nSo maybe they are incredibly strict. Or maybe they're just trying to keep their kids eating healthy, OP's not very healthy at all, and they don't want their kids to emulate OP or OP's kids bad habits. It's definitely an ESH situation in my book, if OP's an accurate narrator, \n\nHonestly, I totally get why SIL was super pissed, I would be too.

Probably not. That was not their decision to make. That said, SIL took a 1 out of 10 intensity problem, and ratcheted it up to 11 out of 10 immediately. \n\nSIL is lucky she was talking to someone that responds with hurtful (true) words when attacked that viciously as opposed to something else.

I would have given them two cookies boundaries be damned. Wait until these kids get to college.

In fact, the mom made a point of sending the kids outside before she confronted OP.

And fat shaming another person as your go to insult. Being strict with your kids diets is fine so long as you instill a healthy mindset towards food. Because if you don't once those kids are out of your control they're very likely to start breaking the 'taboos' and lack the appropriate amount of self control to regulate their new found food freedom.\n\nThe fact that SIL seems to have unhealthy mindsets towards overweight people definitely makes me wonder if she's failing to instill those healthy mindsets in her kids. Can't say for sure as I don't know her and wasn't there, but it definitely made my brow raise.\n\nOP and wife shouldn't have broken their diets and they both are AHs for doing so, but SIL is a whole different kettle of fish.", "There\u2019s no evidence that these parents were doing that.

That is where the SIL sounds over the top, in saying no cookies in the context of three other children receiving cookies that were baked in their presence, while on vacation. It's excessively restrictive, and that plus jumping straight to fat shaming the wife, suggests SIL is raising her kids with some unhealthy thinking around food intake and body image. OP, you shouldn't have broken parents' rules, but I probably would have done the same.

OP has obviously treated them poorly for years because he disapproved of a sex life that is none of his business; he's no angel here. Trashing their boundaries behind their back after they were explicitly given a different directive and doing something that isn't going to help the kid in the long run (even if they're deprived of junk food) was the wrong thing to do. The end. The rest is just extra. OP's wife tried to apologize, but OP did not, and instead if diffusing the situation, continued to play piss-in-the-sandbox and return body shaming with shaming he's obviously been inflicting on them for years, albeit more bluntly.

My friend got punched because of my actions and someone's bad reaction to my actions, and by punching the person who punched my friend, I'm not making matters any better either.

If OP bothered her that much to warrant lashing out there is no way in hell she should have ever left her kids with him. This is on Anne.

I\u2019m honestly not sure what the final straw was anymore but I got tired of our kid\u2019s vacations being so rigid - why? It should be LESS rigid, if anything\u2026 it\u2019s VACATION. So, now the kids do what we allow - and no longer conform to cousin\u2019s rules. They can sleep in a bit, they can have ice cream for dessert and cereal for breakfast. They can be on electronics in their rooms during downtime. It isn\u2019t a free for all by any stretch but it certainly is far from cousins rules\u2026 initially. \nOver the past 3-4 years the cousin\u2019s have been allowed a bit more. I think their mom got tired of the fight and realized we weren\u2019t re-joining the strict rules. \nI would NEVER have given their kids cereal but I also would not forbid my kids from having it or expect them to hide it. Cereal (and cookies) are not shameful things. They see loads of other kids with treats and have to deal.
