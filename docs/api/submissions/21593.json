{"id": 21593, "submission_id": "14tdw1n", "title": "AITA for calling my sister-in-law and brother whores after my sister-in-law insulted both me and my wife?", "selftext": "My wife \\[34F\\] and I \\[47M\\] are staying with my parents \\[72F & 71M\\], grandma \\[90F\\], older brother \\[50M\\], brother-in-law \\[48M\\], their kids \\[10F & 7M\\], younger brother \\[40M\\], sister-in-law \\[38F\\], and their kids \\[9M, 7F, & 4M\\] at a beach house we rented for 2 weeks. \n\nI should preface this by saying that frankly, I do not get along with my younger brother (\"Tod\") and I do not like my sister-in-law (\"Anne\"). That said, I am civil with them and while I don't see them often, I do love my niece and nephews. Yesterday, my wife (\"Alice\") and I were babysitting all of our nieces and nephews while my grandma napped and everyone else went to see a movie. \n\nNow, once we got here, Alice and I had baked cookies for everyone to eat. We'd baked them later in the evening, and Anne (who works as a personal trainer) told her kids that they couldn't have any. The kids were upset, of course (especially since their cousins were allowed cookies), but Anne was insistent that they weren't allowed any at the time. She and Tod are generally quite strict with the kids' diets (none of them have any food allergies), and to my recollection they have only been allowed a popsicle once this past week. While everyone was out, one of the kids asked Alice if they could have cookies, and so we gave them all some cookies to enjoy. \n\nWhen everyone came home, Anne asked the kids what they did, and one of them mentioned that we gave them cookies. She then told them to play on the beach, where they were watched by my older brother and brother-in-law and were joined by their cousins. \n\nAnne then proceeded to get very mad. She started off just saying that we shouldn't have given them cookies because she hadn't said they could have them. Alice started to apologize and say we just wanted to let them enjoy their vacation, but Anne interrupted her and told her that \"she didn't trust a fat ass with \\[her kids'\\] health.\" \n\nNow, I was absolutely livid, and I told her to shut the fuck up. The argument spiraled from there, and at one point Anne said she should never have trusted two \"psychos\" with her kids (Alice and I met in a therapy group 11 years ago after we were discharged from the hospital for mental health concerns - though I'd like to emphasize we weren't there for anything that would ever even imply that we'd put anyone else in danger).\n\nI then told her that it was rich for two whores to think that they could ever raise morally-healthy kids (Anne was originally Tod's \"best friend's\" wife, but the two had an affair, during which their oldest child was conceived, then Anne and her husband had what sounds like a rather messy divorce). \n\nShe then started crying and left, and our family is a bit divided over this. I realize that I was very harsh, but so was she and I do not think it was her place to dish out what she couldn't take.

But I think OP's response may have been shooting themselves in the foot. When you see someone parenting in a way that may be harmful, it's best to try to maintain a healthy relationship with the parents and kids, so that you'll be able to support them.  \nBlatantly going against parents' wishes in this way makes the parents not trust OP, and may limit their access to those kids, who need healthy adult relationships", "Meh, that\u2019s not their call, though. OP stated he does not get along with his brother and sister-in-law which tells me 2 things: 1. He probably doesn\u2019t spend enough time with either of them to determine they have harmful parenting styles, and 2. He may be looking for ways on this vacation to get under their skin. He has no evidence to support a claim that his nieces and nephews are developing eating disorders due to their strict diet, nor did he mention any concerns about it in the post.

It's the SIL's. \n\nWhat is going to end up happening is those kids will end up with eating disorders and overweight because of such a restrictive diet, but SHE will have to figure that out on her own. Restricting cookies isn't going to hurt those kids. We don't know what else she is restricting from them. Remember, all we are getting is ONE side of the story.

Let's ask the kids themselves...", "Yeah these people are making absolutely absurd leaps here. My kid is very sensitive to sugar. I don't mind at all if he has a treat at an appropriate time.

OP won't be able to influence anything about their parenting with the relationship they have.", "I completely agree with this, especially when it\u2019s a large family sharing a vacation home. Expecting other family members to enforce your ultra strict rules is just flat out not realistic in front of other children.

If OP thought the kids were in danger because of the parenting style, he and his wife should have taken them aside without the kids and explained why they see the restrictive diet as harmful. That's all they can do. If the kids aren't being starved or deprived of proper nutrients, no intervention is going to happen from anyone but family and friends. The courts certainly won't care.\n\nAlso, how would OP know that the kids had only had one popsicle all week? We only have OP's (obviously biased) word to go on, which may even be 3rdhand information from a child who just wanted more snacks. Unless OP was told by the parents that they'd only allowed their kids one popsicle as a treat all week and no other sweets, how would they even know?\n\nPossibly the kids had already had snacks before going over there, or possibly the mom had plans for later and didn't want them to overdo it. No one really knows.\n\nThe point is that, yes, ESH because she went in for personal insults and body shaming, but it did start with OP and his wife crapping all over boundaries that other parents set for their own children that may or may not have had a great reason, but were not inherently harmful boundaries on their own, and instead of taking the L and apologizing for overstepping, OP flew right back with just as childish an insult. So no one is the good guy here; yes, if we see a parenting style that we think is harmful in some way, there are better ways to address it than just going behind the parents back (unless the children are in immediate danger).", ">exactly what evidence do you have\n\nJust the fact that Anne escalated so quickly from being upset that the children had a cookie to insulting the body of OP's wife isn't direct evidence, but I propose it as circumstantial evidence that Anne has an issue with food and body type.

OP also states they only had one popsicle in the prior week so there should be no worry about these kids having too much sugar, calories or anything. Vacation time is also a perfectly applicable time to be a little lenient. \n\nCase in point my parents were pretty careful about me and my brothers diets when we were younger, did not allow much sugar or cookies or anything but would allow us to partake as they saw fit; again family time, vacation time and certainly most times when everyone else was partaking.

Please look up orthorexia, especially as a parenting style.", "Not letting them have sweets at all is restrictive and just making sweets the forbidden fruit and that much more desirable.", "It isn't \"whenever they want\", though. It's a cookie, during their vacation. Is it not better to teach them that it's okay to eat what they want, as long as they have it in moderation - controlled amounts, not too often? I agree that OP shouldn't have fed the kids cookies when their parents had already said no, but I have to admit, I also agree that not letting your child have even a single homemade cookie during their vacation is overly strict, and like the previous commenter said, essentially encouraging them to develop eating disorders. They're kids; they don't hear \"controlled food intake = controlled health/body\", or whatever their mom is trying to teach them (which even then isn't something you should be teaching a child that's too young to properly understand, imo, unless they already have weight problems). They hear \"if I eat any of what I want to eat, I get fat, and mom won't like me anymore\".
