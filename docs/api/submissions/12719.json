He does all his own self-care chores; tidies and cleans his own room, does his own laundry, makes his own snacks, lunch, and breakfast. He also does a lot of household chores; loading/unloading the dishwasher, feeding the dog, help make dinner etc. My stepchildren are less inclined to help around the house or even do their own personal chores. \n\nFor the most part my husband and I raise our own kids and have firm boundaries about discipling and parenting each other\u2019s kids. I have a good relationship with my step kids. If I ask my stepchildren to do certain chores they will sometimes, do it and other times so they'll say they\u2019ll do it later and never get back to it. This often ends up with me having to nag them or do it myself. My husband will rarely ask his kids to do any chores. He won't even make them do their own laundry and does it himself, sometimes I have to do it because it gets so backed up, they don't have any clean clothes to wear. The 11-year old's room is always a mess and I regularly have to go in there to get dirty cups and plates. In December I got so sick of the state of it, I made SS help me clean and tidy.

My husband does do some housework but as he works full-time and I only work part-time, I take on the bulk of it.

I even wanted to make it so the kids could earn rewards for doing extra chores to give them incentive. \n\nHe was against this. While I believe that chores are an important way to contribute to the family unit and learn necessary skills for adulthood, my husband doesn't agree. He was raised in a very strict home and both him and his ex-wife believe in more free-range parenting for their kids. He thinks kids shouldn't be burdened with any chores and that he doesn't want his kids to spend their limited free time doing chores that don't interest them. He also doesn't think it will be hard for them to pick up the skills later in life. He thinks I'm an asshole for continuing to bring up his kids doing chores and that if I do make them do more chores, they'll just want to spend more time at their mom's house.

YOU are having the responsibility of removing items such as dishes that should only be in the common area (kitchen/dining room). \n\nI do not think your way of parenting is wrong because you are teaching your child to respect where they live (his personal space & shared spaces) and how to function as a unit. \n\nMaybe instead of suggesting a chore list, state that there needs to be an added house rule that items, such as dishes, that are suppose to be found in shared spaces CANNOT enter personal spaces as to avoid having to retrieve them.

I taught my kids how to pack their own lunches in kindergarten. Being able to feed yourself and make good choices is a life skill. We would grocery shop weekly and they would pick out what they wanted for the week that was healthy. We had pantry shelves for school lunch stuff and for weekend treats and desserts. Laundry is not that big a deal. Everyone in my house has their own laundry basket and is responsible for their own clothes.  I have always explained to my kids that I\u2019m teaching them basic things about life; how to feed yourself, clean your clothes, set an alarm and wake up on time.

I am a teacher with a masters degree in early childhood and I can confidently tell you that when children are young is when you install helping habits. Does your husband make them brush their teeth if they don't want to? Put on shoes and a jacket when it is snowing? Make them where a seatbelt in the car? Probably so and why is that. Oh, because YOU are the adult! It is YOUR (specifically his and his exs) responsibility to raise future independent adults who can function in society. While I understand you can't be so strict, going to the complete opposite spectrum is just as harmful. \n\nChildren need structure and your suggestion is a perfect one. It sets realistic expectations, provides positive rewards, and connects rewards with work. You can't teach an old dog new tricks and it is harder to break a behavior when it has become a habit (look at smoking for instance) than it never getting started.\n\nIf he refuses then you need to step back and refuse to do housework/chores/wash clothes/etc. Let him see how his \"free-range\" parenting is working out for him. Afterall, he expects them to learn the hard way using consequences or just magically learn how to be a functional adult through osmosis so let him handle it.\n\nYTA- though with the amount of responsibility you are placing on your own son. He is too young to be making all of his meals alone. You should be doing that together (at least dinner) so he can learn how to cook things for himself besides sandwiches. I think you need to look up realistic chores for his age group and go from there. Cooking over a hot stove is not appropriate to do alone.", "NTA.  Thank you for teaching your 8-year-old to be a responsible kid.  I'm not sure I was doing my own laundry at that age, but I was definitely sorting and folding.    \n\n\nAs for the other two, it's time for some malicious compliance.  If your husband doesn't think his kids should do chores, your husband should do their share.  Doesn't matter that he works FT and you PT.  No more doing the stepkids' laundry or picking up their dishes.  Buy some ant traps and let them live in slop for a while.", "YTA for trying to overstep your agreement. Suspect the last part about your husband being concerned that his kids won\u2019t want to stay at his, is a key part of his parenting approach.", "YTA. I do think that his approach of never having the kids do any chores is not the right way, but you and him agreed that you\u2019d each decide these things for your own kids. I also think you\u2019re a huge AH for making your EIGHT year old child basically do all his own care tasks. Way too young", "YTA. \n\nIt would be one thing if you wanted your step children to help with more family oriented tasks, but the examples you give (like cleaning SS's room or doing their laundry) are things it sounds like you are putting on yourself. Let his room be messy. Let them wear dirty clothes. Thats on them. If your husband wants those tasks done (which Im not entirely convinced is the case) let him do it. Once you distance yourself from all their tasks that are uniquely theirs, you may find the remaining chores you have to do far more palatable.", "Ugh. NTA. If laundry backs up, they can wear dirty clothes. If they get hungry they will eventually make their own breakfast and lunch. Maybe you can buy a special set of plates for you and your son. You can wash them, and the others can eat off their own filthy plates. I wouldn't want a fight, but I wouldn't do the chores for kids who are close to grown.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your problem would be solved if you stopped doing everything for them. Stop cleaning for them and cooking for them, and they can figure out what to do at that point.", "YTA that is an ambitious list of duties for an 8 year old, plus school and home work\u2026 he needs a vacation", "ESH. You agreed to parenting your own kids only, and shouldn't have gone beyond that, though I get where you are coming from. That said, your husband and his ex are not setting their kids up to be independent, functional adults.\n\nMoving forward, close their doors, refuse to do their laundry, and reward your son like crazy foe doing his chores. Either your husband will pay out the nose trying to balance all you give your son with his kids, or they will start begging for chores.\n\nThe other option would be to make the chores \"optional\" but tied to rewards they REALLY want. This will only work if hubby is on board though.", "NTA. Stop helping your husband and step kids. They will learn real fast to do their own laundry, clean their own rooms, or be shunned by their peers for going to school in dirty clothes or if some of their friends see their rooms. Not your circus, not your monkeys!", "I was \u2018raised\u2019 like this. My mother said it was for my brother and I to be independent and never have to rely on anyone. In reality it was because she was too self-involved to be a parent. I also raised step kids. You are a parent to them and only ever a second rate enforcer of the primary parents rules. If you can\u2019t change the parent\u2019s minds you\u2019re just being an unreasonable jerk in the kids eyes. Not TA, in my opinion because it sounds like you have their best interests at heart and know deep down that they could surely become entitled aasshloes who struggle at adulting.", "Right? My 7yo can prepare meals if needed and loves to get his own snacks and maybe breakfast on the weekends\u2026but all snacks, breakfast and lunch? And all laundry?? C\u2019mon. Let the poor kid be a kid,", "Fr, I agree. I do think it\u2019s important for kids to do chores and to teach them basic life skills, but 8 is too young for most of that. Strange", "Glad I'm not the only one that thought the 8yo list was excessive. I was reading this like damn looks like that 8 year old should make HER a chore chart and get some help around the house.", "I agree and this is how I feel about OP. She is too hard on her son and the husband is too permissive. At BEST it\u2019s ESH.\n\nAs far as dishes/laundry, don\u2019t do the laundry (natural consequence for the husband) and only let paper plates/cups go into rooms because you can\u2019t not have dishes for the rest of the family.", "Right!? Does he do your taxes as well OP? \n\nThis is  a lot for an 8 year old. YTA.", "She wouldn\u2019t be out of clothes since she has her 8yo doing the laundry\u2026", "She said he only makes his own snacks, breakfast, and lunch, is that too much? \n\nMy mom was also like this when I was his age so I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird", "I snorted at \u201csings with tiny mice\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "As someone who was not raised like this I wish I had to do more chores as a kid instead of having to figure things out at 23.", "I went through what OP\u2019s son is going through and I cried at one point about how overwhelmed I was with everything to my aunt and she turned around and told my mom I was claiming to be \u201cCinderella\u201d.  Honestly I left home at 16. Pushed for emancipation, moved across country to stay with my grandma for a little bit. Went NC for a long time. \n\nYeah OP, YTA. You\u2019ve agreed to your own parenting styles and now you\u2019re pushing your own agenda onto him and his kids.", "OP said she washes the steps clothes when they  are out. Stop washing the steps clothes and eventually they will learn to do their laundry or dad will be forced to deal with it.", "Breakfast and lunch and snacks everyday? That\u2019s a lot for an 8yo. And all the laundry?", "The recommended way of doing this would be to gradually introduce new tasks at an age-appropriate time. Having the kid do all these things is okay, sure, but every day is a great way to make folks overwhelmed.", "Same. My mom was a hoarder and our house was never clean, so I was never expected to do any chores. I used to keep my room and bathroom clean, and that was it. When I moved into my own place, things were clean. But the moment I had kids, I stopped being able to keep up and my house is a mess. I mean, I know how to clean, but the habits aren't there. I also have ADHD, depression and anxiety, which doesn't help. But I feel like if I'd had the foundation for chores things would be better.", "There is definitely a happy medium.", "She did not say \u201call the laundry.\u201d She said he does his own laundry.", "My situation wasn\u2019t bad, I was just coddled/treated like the princess of the house by boomer/gen x cuspers who went the opposite direction in some ways of how they were raised. Like you I\u2019m neurodivergent and have anxiety and keeping up with cleaning is hard for me.", "That makes no sense. How much clothing could a child have to even get to a half a load of laundry before he runs out?", "At his age, I did my own laundry every Thursday evening, like clockwork. Started doing this at 6 years old. \n\nWhy is everyone acting like it's rocket science? You throw everything into the washer, put it all on the cold cycle, and it's fine? It takes at most, 15 mins out of your day, including folding.  \n\nThis is how I've done my laundry going on 30 years. It also ensured in a big family that nothing ever went missing, my sheets were clean, and I always had something to wear.  Does this work for \\*every\\* kid? No, probably not. But it's not beyond the grasp of an 8 year old, either."]}
