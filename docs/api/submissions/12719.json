This often ends up with me having to nag them or do it myself. My husband will rarely ask his kids to do any chores. He won't even make them do their own laundry and does it himself, sometimes I have to do it because it gets so backed up, they don't have any clean clothes to wear.

YOU are having the responsibility of removing items such as dishes that should only be in the common area (kitchen/dining room). \n\nI do not think your way of parenting is wrong because you are teaching your child to respect where they live (his personal space & shared spaces) and how to function as a unit. \n\nMaybe instead of suggesting a chore list, state that there needs to be an added house rule that items, such as dishes, that are suppose to be found in shared spaces CANNOT enter personal spaces as to avoid having to retrieve them.

I taught my kids how to pack their own lunches in kindergarten. Being able to feed yourself and make good choices is a life skill. We would grocery shop weekly and they would pick out what they wanted for the week that was healthy. We had pantry shelves for school lunch stuff and for weekend treats and desserts. Laundry is not that big a deal. Everyone in my house has their own laundry basket and is responsible for their own clothes.  I have always explained to my kids that I\u2019m teaching them basic things about life; how to feed yourself, clean your clothes, set an alarm and wake up on time.

I am a teacher with a masters degree in early childhood and I can confidently tell you that when children are young is when you install helping habits. Does your husband make them brush their teeth if they don't want to? Put on shoes and a jacket when it is snowing? Make them where a seatbelt in the car? Probably so and why is that. Oh, because YOU are the adult! It is YOUR (specifically his and his exs) responsibility to raise future independent adults who can function in society. While I understand you can't be so strict, going to the complete opposite spectrum is just as harmful. \n\nChildren need structure and your suggestion is a perfect one. It sets realistic expectations, provides positive rewards, and connects rewards with work. You can't teach an old dog new tricks and it is harder to break a behavior when it has become a habit (look at smoking for instance) than it never getting started.\n\nIf he refuses then you need to step back and refuse to do housework/chores/wash clothes/etc. Let him see how his \"free-range\" parenting is working out for him. Afterall, he expects them to learn the hard way using consequences or just magically learn how to be a functional adult through osmosis so let him handle it.\n\nYTA- though with the amount of responsibility you are placing on your own son. He is too young to be making all of his meals alone. You should be doing that together (at least dinner) so he can learn how to cook things for himself besides sandwiches. I think you need to look up realistic chores for his age group and go from there. Cooking over a hot stove is not appropriate to do alone.", "NTA.  Thank you for teaching your 8-year-old to be a responsible kid.  I'm not sure I was doing my own laundry at that age, but I was definitely sorting and folding.    \n\n\nAs for the other two, it's time for some malicious compliance.  If your husband doesn't think his kids should do chores, your husband should do their share.  Doesn't matter that he works FT and you PT.  No more doing the stepkids' laundry or picking up their dishes.  Buy some ant traps and let them live in slop for a while.", "YTA for trying to overstep your agreement. Suspect the last part about your husband being concerned that his kids won\u2019t want to stay at his, is a key part of his parenting approach.", "YTA. I do think that his approach of never having the kids do any chores is not the right way, but you and him agreed that you\u2019d each decide these things for your own kids. I also think you\u2019re a huge AH for making your EIGHT year old child basically do all his own care tasks. Way too young", "YTA. \n\nIt would be one thing if you wanted your step children to help with more family oriented tasks, but the examples you give (like cleaning SS's room or doing their laundry) are things it sounds like you are putting on yourself. Let his room be messy. Let them wear dirty clothes. Thats on them. If your husband wants those tasks done (which Im not entirely convinced is the case) let him do it. Once you distance yourself from all their tasks that are uniquely theirs, you may find the remaining chores you have to do far more palatable.", "Ugh. NTA. If laundry backs up, they can wear dirty clothes. If they get hungry they will eventually make their own breakfast and lunch. Maybe you can buy a special set of plates for you and your son. You can wash them, and the others can eat off their own filthy plates. I wouldn't want a fight, but I wouldn't do the chores for kids who are close to grown.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I read OP\u2019s chores for her 8 y/o and in no way do I think OP is treating her son like a servant. She is teaching her son how to do his own laundry (again-not anyone else\u2019s\u2026 just his own.) She is expecting him to have ownership of his space, his belongings, and his messes. These are important life skills that many individuals don\u2019t learn because their parents don\u2019t take the time to teach them or have expectations of them. (It\u2019s actually easier to \u201cdo it yourself\u201d as a parent then it is to teach a child to do a chore, hold them to the expectation that it will be done, check the quality of doneness, and follow up regularly to make sure that chore is done.) \n\nIMO OP asked her 8 y/o to do very little \u201cwork\u201d that isn\u2019t basically maintaining his own belongings and space. Loading/unloading the dishwasher, feeding the dog, and *helping* with dinner isn\u2019t slave labor, guys. It\u2019s basic chores. That child will be thanking his parents when he is self-sufficient and competent as an independent adult. Doing laundry these days in most countries is extremely easy. She\u2019s not asking her 8 y/o to scrub his clothes by hand over a washing board. Load laundry, insert detergent, choose setting, hit start. Folding clothes is also not that difficult, and in fact, is a great way to develop fine and gross motor skills. Children who are unprepared for the reality of life on their own frequently get smacked in the face. They go through a massive shock when they realize how much work a typical day holds, and worst of all, if they haven\u2019t been taught how to clean, do laundry, and cook, adult life is harder than it needs to be, not to mention the unnecessary expense involved in ruining clothes, burning dinners, ordering takeout, and hiring outside cleaning help. \n\nAs for OP\u2019s step-children, at 11 and 14, they should absolutely be cleaning their own rooms. Yes - she is not their mother, but she didn\u2019t punish them for not cleaning. She tried to gently assert some authority about household tasks, which IMO falls under the role her husband assigned her as \u201chousehold manager\u201d due to her part-time position at work. The real AH here is their dad, who is essentially slacking on his **job** as a parent in order to win \u201cfavored parent\u201d points. Runner-up AH is their bio mom, who isn\u2019t coparenting with their dad in a way that prevents the kids from weaponizing household chores and custody time with their dad to get out of normal responsibilities. Saying things like \u201ca child\u2019s bedroom is their space and they can have it how they want\u201d is meant to extend to decor, layout of furniture, and wall-hangings. It ends at cleanliness, destroying the space, etc. Where is the line? Are the kids allowed to decorate their bedroom walls with grape jelly all because it\u2019s \u201ctheir space?\u201d Is it ok if food starts to mold in their bedrooms bc nobody is requiring them to clean up after themselves? **Come on\u2026** OP\u2019s husband is an absolute AH here. He\u2019s abusing the concept of \u201claid-back parenting.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like OP has *tried* to get her husband to be an active parent, but he would prefer to be a combination of absentee parent who expects very little of his children and snowplow parent who \u201cdoes the work\u201d for his children rather than prepare his children for adult life. \n\nOP, you aren\u2019t the AH here, but my advice is to stop having the \u201cparenting method\u201d fight with your husband. I would simply set your boundaries as - \u201cI won\u2019t tell you how to parent your kids, but I need all spaces in this house to be at a certain cleanliness and I\u2019m not cleaning up after your kids anymore. If you don\u2019t want them to clean up after themselves or have a chore chart, then you can do clean up after them. If you don\u2019t expect them to help with dinner or have chores as people who live here and contribute to the food demands and mess-making, then you need to do their share of the cooking/cleaning. I shouldn\u2019t have to pick up the slack left by your decision not to require them to clean up after themselves or help out around the house as household members.\u201d \n\nYou can\u2019t force him to parent his children the way you want. Reddit is right about that. It\u2019s not your place. You can ask, but he has the ultimate say. It stinks that you guys are married and not in alignment on parenting. I would gently recommend couples\u2019 counseling, since I see a lot of potential pitfalls in your future based on your different parenting outlooks and the struggle to get to a compromise you can both live with. That said, regardless of whether or not it\u2019s \u201chis right\u201d to parent his children how he wants, his approach is an AH approach, as it forces you to pick up the slack, doesn\u2019t consider your feelings when it comes to a clean house, and overall is going to fail his kids when it comes to preparedness for adult life. You don\u2019t have to be a rigid parent to expect your children to help out, and having chores as a child is not servanthood.", "NTA but stop doing their laundry at a minimum.

And personally I would make it a daily task, not a once a week thing because that just sounds gross especially since she mentions the kids taking dishes to their rooms. Now that\u2019s either going to piss off the step kids or the husband is going to probably get fed up doing it, but that\u2019s the consequences of not adding the rule.", "Again I don't disagree, but even those small changes will require the support of OP's husband to implement successfully.

I don't see why people get upset with the breakfast snacks can be a bag of chips or a sandwich.   When me and my sisters were younger we did dishes and made our breakfast school days and laundry we switched off on chores.
