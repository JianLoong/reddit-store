It started a while back when his mom told me I wasn't allowed to join the family lunch on Easter if I didn't go to church with them. I am pagan they are Christian. My husband told me to get over my discomfort and stop ruining his holiday. Long story short he spent the day with his family and I stayed home. I should also add that I have gone to their church 2 times prior because his mom wanted to show off our children. Each time I have been uncomfortable and \"sucked it up.\" this time I finally said no. \n\nThen comes the day before Thanksgiving and his mom tells him and his brother only are requested to attend dinner with their aunt who is in town. Only it turns out the entire family was there just not me. His mom says it was just a mistake and he believes her. The only thing is the restaurant was only 10 minutes from the house and If it was a mistake I could have been called at any point to join in, I wasn't. \n\nBecause Of the Easter incident and this, I told my husband I would no longer be attending ANY family gatherings, and as far as I was concerned his mom could kick rocks. \n\nHe said this was unfair and we came to the compromise that I would attend Thanksgiving and Christmas and that on Christmas Eve we would start our own holidays. \n\nFast forward to one day before Christmas Eve. I'm super excited I've wrapped all the gifts made plans etc. \n\nHowever, his mom invited us over for Christmas Eve, and I expressed a desire to stick to our plan, he insisted we didn't have concrete plans and pressured me to attend, saying my attitude towards family gatherings could lead to a divorce and how he thought we had moved past the Thanksgiving incident. \n\nEventually, we agreed to spend Christmas Eve as originally planned, but then he remembered he promised his dad and siblings he would spend Christmas Eve golfing and that's exactly what he was going to do. \n\nOn Christmas Eve, I woke up feeling genuinely unwell told him as much and he still left me and the two kids 3 months and 2 years by ourselves to go golfing. A couple hours later I called to let him know I had a fever of 104 and he told me he had 4 holes left and would be home soon. \n\nI spent the rest of that day and Christmas sick. He took the kids to his mom's house and came back telling me we're now expected to spend both Christmas Eve and Christmas at his parent's house to make opening gifts less chaotic.
