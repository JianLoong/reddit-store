He obviously doesn\u2019t respect you, he\u2019s going to continue to do whatever his mom wants, his family obviously doesn\u2019t bother to include you, and he\u2019s told you what he expects from you. To stay home and take care of the kids no matter what. He\u2019s walking all over you and standing up to him isn\u2019t working. Do you really want to set that example for your kids?", "Why are 2 married?", "Grow a spine and divorce this person already. He doesn't care about you one bit, only about himself and his real family, mom, dad etc.", "You're NTA \n\n>he insisted we didn't have concrete plans and pressured me to attend, saying **my attitude** towards family gatherings could lead to a divorce \n\nI vote you take him up on that. He is more committed to his uber controlling mommy than he is to his wife and children.", "NTA\n\nNothing will get better it's time for a divorce", "NTA, but you would be if you don't divorce him. Let's look at the facts.\n\n- Doesn't defend you against his mother. I don't believe he didn't realize you were the only SO missing at the dinner.\n- Makes an agreement with you, pushes you to break agreement once, reluctantly sticks with agreement, then breaks it anyway to *go golfing*\n- Leaves you with a 100+ fever, which he knew about before he left, to care for two small children. This could have endangered at least the youngest one.\n- When you call to ask for help *with the kids you're both the parents of*, he insist on finishing the golf course. Playing golf with your dad is more important to him than your health and the wellbeing of his children.\n- Breaks another promise by dragging you to Christmas Day with his parents anyway.\n\nDivorce him. He does not care about you or your children.", "Ah please choose the divorce option that he threatened you with. NTA, well except to yourself. You were sick with a significant fever and he couldn\u2019t be bothered to care for you or help with the kids, golf was more important than his family. Think about that long and hard, golf was more important than his family and he left you alone on Christmas, plus the other holidays too.", "NTA Sounds like your attitude to family gatherings should become more pronounced if it\u2019s going to lead to divorce. Really pitch that sucker so it lands.", "You need to divorce him already. He\u2019s a mommas boy and clearly doesn\u2019t care for you at all.", "YTA - this is the part where comprise comes into relationships. If something is important to your SO, it should be important to you.", "NTA\n\nIt's hard being married to someone of different beliefs and even harder when you are sick and they dgaf. You may want to reconsider the dynamics or the relationship and possibly seek family therapy kf not a divorce. If you have a fever of 104 that means you could pass away and need to be in the hospital and yet he finished his golf game and then came home... not a good sign", "That goes both ways, you know. Starting their own Christmas eve tradition is important to the OP, so her SO should find it important. She's already compromising by going over on Christmas Day, when she really doesn't want to. Compromise doesn't mean doing whatever the other person wants, it means meeting in the middle. OP gets Christmas eve, and the SO gets Christmas day. Problem solved.\n\nETA: Also, the SO left his sick wife home with two children under three to go golfing. Who abandons their sick spouse to go golfing? You'd think that his wife's health, and her dangerously high fever, would be more important to him than the last four holes, wouldn't you?", "What?! How about if someone is treating your SO like crap, you should give a crap?  Husband and MIL demand OP put aside her beliefs (just as important as theirs) in order to be allowed to attend family lunch, exclude her from other family gatherings then disregard her plans for Christmas Eve and instead just state, \u201cthis is what we\u2019re doing\u201d. I don\u2019t see any compromise on the part of the husband. Having Christmas Eve to themselves was the least compromise she could have got, as she didn\u2019t want to go to any family gatherings and instead came away with having to go to thanksgiving and Christmas (you know, literally ALL of the holidays for the rest of the year), with the caveat that she got Christmas Eve. OP is in no way TA, but her husband and MIL sure are. Particularly husband since he seems to not give a crap about her wants or feelings and doesn\u2019t honour their plans or help out with his kids when she\u2019s sick.", "Terrible comment.", "OP's husband that you?", "NTA your husband is a mamas boy who needs to grow up.  He is not respectful to your beliefs but expects you to be respectful to his families.  Tell him to kick rocks", "NTA and honestly his threat of divorce sounds like a blessing. He sounds like a mommy's boy who will never set boundaries with her. \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA your husband doesn't care about the fact that his mom is deliberately excluding you or that you were sick and miserable and running a serious fever while doing childcare. So what about you does he care about?", "No father who genuinely loved his children and his spouse would ditch them all for golfing while his spouse is that sick. Even aside from the fact that he promised to spend the holiday with you and then broke his promise, you should be in bed resting, not solo parenting! NTA.", "NTA\n\n>he insisted we didn't have concrete plans and pressured me to attend, saying my attitude towards family gatherings could lead to a divorce\n\nNo HIS attitude to you and his kids will lead to divorce.\n\n It's time. Start squirreling away money and any important paperwork you need.   Find a safe place for you and the kids.  Compile the paperwork for what a divorce attorney will need.\n\nHopefully you can get most of it done by Easter. So you can rise up and take back your power.  For he is being a bit and walking over you and not giving a fuck about you", "NTA\n\n> my attitude towards family gatherings could lead to a divorce\n\nHe\u2019s using this as a manipulation tactic but I would consider taking him up on it based on the level of respect and care you\u2019ve described.", "NTA. See a lawyer. See a marriage counselor.", "why are you with this person?", "INFO: Does he *ever* respect you? Or does mommy always get her way?", "Divorce\n\nDivorce\n\nDivorce\n\nStop staying with people who do not respect you", "You have a husband problem. He's more interested in pleasing mommy then being with you.\n\nNTA obviously, but I'd probably take him up on the divorce- and take the kids with you.", "NTA. Your husband chose to marry a pagan. He knows your beliefs. If he won\u2019t stand up for you and still chooses his parents over you then he\u2019s not honoring his wedding vows. You\u2019re not being a Grinch, but you are being an AH to yourself by staying with a man who doesn\u2019t prioritize you or stand up for you to his parents. He\u2019s showing you who comes first in his eyes.", "It's not a matter of if but when this relationship is going to end badly, one way or another. Start preparations now and a safe place to stay since your husband and in-laws can't be counted on", "Right? I see posts like this where the partner is like. Okay, I'll compromise and get my way both ways.\n\nAnd the other person's left holding the bag usually while sick and taking care of the kids themselves.\n\nIf my partner was out golfing well I had 104\u00b0 fever, I would be planning my escape."]}
