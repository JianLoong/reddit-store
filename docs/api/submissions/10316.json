I find it presumptuous that your MIL took it upon herself to book a room for two adult couples to share without talking to anyone first. And then to have the audacity to call you \u201cungrateful\u201d? You are not ungrateful- she overstepped and made an assumption about your travel needs. It\u2019s not weird that a couple would want privacy. Tell her thanks but no thanks and get your own room.", "Four people, one bathroom, getting ready for a wedding at the same time? That\u2019s a no from me, dawg. NTA.", "NTA \n\nMost adults aren\u2019t looking to share a hotel room with another couple if they can afford not to", "Sounds to me like mom is just trying to make sure that her kids don\u2019t have sex during the trip.  NTA", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a grown adult and can make your own choices. Just do it.", "Nope NTA Thank your mother in law but let her know you and your partner will book your own room.", "NTA, but if your partner isn't the one running interference on this then you need to have a serious talk with him.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe it's a nice gesture for her to offer to pay for a room for you, but she should realize that you and your partner want to have a private room to yourselves.", "NTA obviously, but why didn't your partner deliver that information to his mother?", "NTA - you're all adults, why would you want to share?", "NTA- Say you snore if it will help deflect the weird vibes, although yes I realize you should be able to be honest about it. Some people get weird about stuff if they are putting up the money, but that\u2019s about them and their need to feel like they did something big.", "NTA. Mil should have asked instead of assuming her kids and their SOs would want to share a room. She's not required to pay for 2 rooms but then you could have turned her down. Politely.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get why it matters who paid for the room/where you sleep. You\u2019re not refusing to pay your portion or something, you want to pay for a room. I can\u2019t see how this is a problem other than maybe she feels like you threw back a gift? If you want, you could try just having a calm conversation with your MIL, let her know you appreciate her looking out for you both, but you really would feel more comfortable not sharing a room. I think that first part is important, to let her know you appreciate it. She might be feeling rejected.", "NTA. \n\nHaving been in a similar circumstance, it was arranged as a family getaway in addition to the wedding. Family activities taking place before and after the wedding so we all shared rooms. \n\nI'm assuming this is what your MIL wants to achieve, but maybe turn down the hotel but ask to meet up for brunch the day after with everyone instead?", "You definitely didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You are an adult who can make decisions for yourself and she needs to respect that and your boundaries. I suggest you talk to your partner a little more about this, because even though this is just a little thing, It could lead to a bigger things happening and worse situations.", "NTA\n\nYou are entitled to your privacy, and choice to share a room. This should've been communicated by MIL before she booked the room. For her to say you are ungrateful seems like an attempt at emotional manipulation.", "NTA - it\u2019s kinda weird but maybe MIL was trying to be thoughtful. Thank her for the kind gesture but say you already have your lodging covered, not refundable if you have to go there.", "NTA, they didn\u2019t bother to ask you. That\u2019s on them.", "You\u2019re 30 and way past college frat house days.  MIL should realize that.  NTA", "You didn't do anything wrong. They made a decision without running it by you first. NTA.", "NTA that is a very odd sleeping arrangement for adults who can afford their own room. I would have done the same as you.", "NTA. She shouldn't have done this without asking you first. It's a really strange thing for her to expect that you would want to do this.", "Nta. While generous, personal arrangements like that should be discussed before booking.  Your partner needs to have your back on this. \"We so appreciate that you thought of us mom,  but we're going to book our own room so that everyone has their privacy. \"", "NTA- you are an adult and paying for yourself. Thank her for the nice gesture but say you have booked your own room", "Totally NTA!  You\u2019re an adult and you get to make your own reservations!!  If she got ticked off about you declining the reservation she made for you (and she never asked, she just did it), that\u2019s just too bad.  Maybe she should ask another adult (?!) before making reservations for them.\n\ngo and have fun and get your own room.", "NTA it is not ungrateful to refuse something you never asked for or wanted and makes you uncomfortable. She is annoyed because she is trying to control the situation. If you get your own room, she cant.", "NTA\n\nAs long as you're willing to pay for your own hotel room, I don't see the problem.  Maybe your MIL has to feel in control over everything related to the wedding?\n\nYour MIL is the AH here for insisting you share a hotel room with your partner's sister and her husband.", "NTA- bunking up together is for kiddie sleep overs or frat parties, not two grown ass couples who need their own space.\n\nI\u2019m guessing MIL still sees her kids as the former or latter.", "Snoring could keep you from getting a good nights sleep \u2026 definitely not the asshole.  I value my sleep too. \nControlling people are annoying af.", "NTA. She\u2019s ungrateful if any one is, you\u2019re doing everyone a favor, now the other couple can have a room to themselves and everyone can have their privacy like most adults enjoy\u2026 I would never stay in the same hotel room as another adult couple related or not, we very much like our privacy. This is another example of someone taking something personal and getting offended when it had nothing to do with them or their actions\u2026 so sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA\n\nYou were not asked if you were okay sharing a room. You were not asked if you wanted them to make a reservation at all.  It is not ungrateful to say no thanks we'll just get our own room. You are all adults and it is a bit odd to expect married couples to share a room.", "Nta as long as you were actually appreciative. \"Thank you so much for the room. However, we'd prefer a private room so we'll pay for it, and this way SIL and husband get their own room, too\". Vs \"No. We don't want to sleep with other people. What were you thinking?\"", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHis is easy: get your own room, and ignore them. Tell them THEY can share the room with BIL themselves.", "NTA.\n\nUm. You\u2019re paying for it. What\u2019s the big deal?", "NTA", "NTA. What kind of bullshit is that?  No 30 year old couple wants to share a room with another couple. I wouldn\u2019t take that room for free either.", "Are there two doubles in the room or adjoining rooms you can close the door between?

NTA.\n\nOP, your husband needs to contact his mother and tell her that you two will be paying for your own room. He should get his sister on board, too. If MIL pushes and fusses tell him to bring up your sex life. It'll shut her down. \n\nA simple: \"Mom, we are both married couples. My wife and I will likely want to have sex at some point and I'm sure sister and her husband will want to, too. That is not appropriate in a shared room.
