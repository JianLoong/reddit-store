Or highlighting that you two have more money than anyone else in the nuclear family.

If you had expected MIL to pay for it--could have been a little bit a-ish, but you were all good.", "Well, thank her and enjoy yourselves, she\u2019s been punished and apologized hopefully you\u2019ll all move on", "NTA, super wierd tbh, 30 yr old couples don't share hotel rooms unless they're swingers.", "NTA My husband and I have shared a room with my sister and her husband many times. There\u2019s a casino a couple hours away we go to every once in awhile overnight and we just go to have fun and we save some money by sharing. Now in our situation my sister and I are very close, we got with our husbands as young teens and we all grew up together spending all our weekends together. We\u2019re each close with each others spouses. My brother in law is more like a brother. He\u2019s the one who taught me how to drive when everyone else was (rightfully lol) to scared to teach me (he also taught my daughter because as scary as I was she was worse lol) My sister feels the same about my husband. To use it\u2019s not a huge deal. However if you asked me to share a room with my husbands brother and his ex I would have been way to uncomfortable, I\u2019d either get my own room or just not go. Nobody should just assume anyone would feel comfortable sharing a room with someone.", "NTA and book a totally lavish, multi room suite in a hotel. Go out with a bang!!", "All drinking coffee in the morning and blowing up the bathroom. Never mind the wedding. I can\u2019t think of in what world this would seem like a good option if it wasn\u2019t necessary because of a financial or room availability reason. \ud83d\ude33", "To me, it sounds more like she thought they were kids who would like to have a sleepover.", "Wait until she's pestering them for grandkids. Oh how the turn tables.", "I just updated about that!", "Yeah I guess I was very vague so firstly she is a very kind women she in my opinion is extremely sensitive, self conscious and anxious. She is going to bring this up and guilt us about this for a while. (That\u2019s what I meant by win lose) she\u2019ll probably say \u201cwell I was trying to do a nice thing and everyone got mad at me for being nice\u201d or \u201clast time I tried to do something nice everyone hated it anyway\u201d Im not sure if she knows what she\u2019s doing when she makes us feel guilty for things but she does it a lot. And yes we do tell her she\u2019s doing it and she doesn\u2019t seem to understand. \n\nSo I guess my unenthusiastic reaction to getting privacy is me knowing I\u2019ll have to deal with that lol I wanted to find a way where she couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t react like this but I guess that wasn\u2019t realistic. \n\nHer and her daughter have a very hot and cold relationship and I don\u2019t know how the conversation went all I know is when I told her she reacted with \u201cWHAT THE FUCK NO\u201d and I believe called her mother.", "The controlling behavior to stop both couples from having their intimacy is audacious\n\n\u2018How dare you prevent me from preventing you from having sex!\u2019", "OP says partner, not husband. How much do you want to bet MIL is meddling because she has hang ups about \"pre-marital\" sex? Double AH points for dragging the other couple into it as stand-in chaperones", "So she's manipulative. Got it!", "I posted earlier find a nice B&B, book to rooms and have fun without her.", "Just read the update. NTA. I\u2019d still go ahead and book your own room without letting her know. Personally I\u2019d feel more comfortable knowing I have a room secured because of all the drama with your MIL. Maybe she did book a room for sil/spouse and a separate one for you/spouse or maybe she plans to share with one of y\u2019all. (There should be three rooms in total no? Where is MIL sleeping?) or she could say the hotel cancelled one of them at the last minute. Either way its better to be safe than sorry in this situation.", "I mean it sounds like the couples just deal with her on the principal that she\u2019s your spouses mother? There does seem to be an undertone of dislike towards her. I can understand that especially with her guilt tripping behavior and constantly bringing up past events such as this one. If she does try to guilt trip you guys about this again I would just stop the communication right there (and continue to do so until she got the hint) I don\u2019t think she\u2019s narcissistic though. Just another old woman being rude to her adult children occasionally. \n\nWhatever your SIL said and did most definitely solved that problem though lol! (I\u2019m not trying to suggest low contact or no contact because I don\u2019t know your relationships and whatnot, but if it does get to be too much for you, I don\u2019t think any of us would blame you for taking a step back with her. Even more so if your husband also backs you up and handles the relationship with her himself!)", "Often disguised as altruism", "Yeah but in my head I don\u2019t think she even sees how that is manipulation. That could be me just trying to see it that way", "I never even thought about where she would be sleeping oh my lol", "Like some kind of congressman", "You definitely want to see it that way because knowing somebody's setting out to manipulate you just feels icky and we don't want to feel like people are doing that to us!", "When I was young, I would share hotel rooms with friends at science fiction conventions.  It helped everyone with finances.  It was terrible.  Wet towels on the bed!  A couple having sex when I was in the room!  Chaos!  Disaster!  \n\nIt's actually amazing I still talk to those people.\n\nJust say no to sharing hotel rooms.", "NTA", "NTA I'm a parent and I just want to say not all parents are weird like this. I would never think two adult  couples would want to share a room, married or not. \n\nwith adults and adult couples, there is always an expectation of privacy. that's why MIL has her own room!", "Ugh, NTA. You're adults, not high school students who can't afford to travel without stuffing as many people in one room as possible \n\nMIL is ridiculous thinking two adult couples should share a room.", "NTA... I like to save money, but I will pay extra for my own room. I'd rather skip meals", "NTA, but be kind to your MIL, this sounds like a kind gesture that landed wrong.", "NTA - What the heck? Doesn't she know what married couples do in hotel rooms? How did she think her own children were made? Like...is she starting to lose her mental acuity? Is she OK?", "NTA but I would be telling her that you didn\u2019t want to share because you\u2019d feel uncomfortable having sex with your sil and her husband were in the next bed. Embarrass her.", "yeah even if no one was planning on having any sex, this is an extremely uncomfortable situation", "I would only consider it assholeish if they were insisting the MIL pay for additional accomodation, but they offered to pay for it themselves so what's the issue?", "Yup its about control", "I get terrible nightmares and have been known to punch my SO in my sleep. My FIL gets night terrors and yells in the middle of the night.

MIL shooting herself in the foot here, big time!", "Oh gosh \ud83d\ude02 That\u2019s a comedy movie plot line right there!", "I legit spit out my tea reading this!", "I refer to my spouse as my partner. I know a lot of people who use interchangeably with spouse or husband/wife.", "idk, she also called her partner's sister her SIL. they could easily be married", "I love swifties", "Like, does she not know what couples do when they're alone, or is she just pretending not to know? All of this is bizarre. All of it.", "Tale as old as time", "I think parents often forget their kids are adults now and may want privacy.\nOP NTA.. and good on you to approach SIL..\n\nAlso I've learned it's more productive for me (f) to talk to MIL than my partner (m). He agrees to whatever, forgets about boundaries or even what he's supposed to say after we discussed it. I gave up, I'll deal with her myself.", "Maybe she thought it would be like a childhood pajama party.....heaven help her! NTA", "Sounds like MIL thinks you are all still around 12 years old and would enjoy a sleepover!  \n\nI'm going NAH because MIL is clearly being ridiculous, but she meant well and has corrected her mistake.  You and your SIL have the right to privacy and the right to tell MIL you didn't like her idea.", "Seems you made your point and it was corrected to your liking and  you are still complaining.\n\nYTA", "Especially not with their grown siblings. I love my brother and sister in law but in no universe am I sharing a bathroom with his ass again unless absolutely necessary. And he wouldn\u2019t want to see me without a bra or in bed with my husband. It\u2019s just awkward as fuck.", "I laughed at \"but you're all the same age\". Sounds like a clueless parent who looks at their 30-year old offspring and still sees a kid. Maybe she imagines they will stay up telling spooky stories and playing board games.", "Yeah it's super weird, and I don't know any 30ish couples that would want to share a room with another couple.  I literally just booked my own room on a trip with my childhood friend's family even though he assumed we'd stay together.  I'm just more comfortable in my own room, and since I'm a grown-up & can afford it, why not?", "You guys must all be eating pizza a couple of hours before going to sleep.", "She sounds manipulating and exhausting.", "You never know MIL could be from Alabama.", "Reserve and pay for your own room (perhaps choose a different hotel if you prefer).\n\nIf you don't, she'll control what kind of room you get, the floor you're on, which room are adjoining, and she may be bold enough to ask for her own keycard at the front desk. You're not children. You don't need supervision. \n\nBy making reservations for you, she crossed a boundary. Better nip this kind of behavior in the bud right away. Or the next time, she'll book hotel rooms and plane tickets for you.", "for 4 of you to share a room? how old does she think you all are? 8? 10?", "NTA. She was trying to be nice but also failed to see you all as full-grown adults who would obviously want their own rooms. She needed to be corrected on this, or it was bound to happen again.\n\nI do hope your SIL didn\u2019t go too hard on her though since MIL\u2019s intentions were good. Hopefully though she\u2019ll just let you all get your own rooms on your own though.", "That sounds like a her problem."]}
