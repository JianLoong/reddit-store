I find it presumptuous that your MIL took it upon herself to book a room for two adult couples to share without talking to anyone first. And then to have the audacity to call you \u201cungrateful\u201d? You are not ungrateful- she overstepped and made an assumption about your travel needs. It\u2019s not weird that a couple would want privacy. Tell her thanks but no thanks and get your own room.", "Four people, one bathroom, getting ready for a wedding at the same time? That\u2019s a no from me, dawg. NTA.", "NTA \n\nMost adults aren\u2019t looking to share a hotel room with another couple if they can afford not to", "Sounds to me like mom is just trying to make sure that her kids don\u2019t have sex during the trip.  NTA", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re a grown adult and can make your own choices. Just do it.", "Nope NTA Thank your mother in law but let her know you and your partner will book your own room.", "NTA, but if your partner isn't the one running interference on this then you need to have a serious talk with him.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe it's a nice gesture for her to offer to pay for a room for you, but she should realize that you and your partner want to have a private room to yourselves.", "NTA obviously, but why didn't your partner deliver that information to his mother?", "NTA - you're all adults, why would you want to share?", "NTA- Say you snore if it will help deflect the weird vibes, although yes I realize you should be able to be honest about it. Some people get weird about stuff if they are putting up the money, but that\u2019s about them and their need to feel like they did something big.", "NTA. Mil should have asked instead of assuming her kids and their SOs would want to share a room. She's not required to pay for 2 rooms but then you could have turned her down. Politely.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get why it matters who paid for the room/where you sleep. You\u2019re not refusing to pay your portion or something, you want to pay for a room. I can\u2019t see how this is a problem other than maybe she feels like you threw back a gift? If you want, you could try just having a calm conversation with your MIL, let her know you appreciate her looking out for you both, but you really would feel more comfortable not sharing a room. I think that first part is important, to let her know you appreciate it. She might be feeling rejected.", "NTA. \n\nHaving been in a similar circumstance, it was arranged as a family getaway in addition to the wedding. Family activities taking place before and after the wedding so we all shared rooms. \n\nI'm assuming this is what your MIL wants to achieve, but maybe turn down the hotel but ask to meet up for brunch the day after with everyone instead?", "You definitely didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You are an adult who can make decisions for yourself and she needs to respect that and your boundaries. I suggest you talk to your partner a little more about this, because even though this is just a little thing, It could lead to a bigger things happening and worse situations.", "NTA\n\nYou are entitled to your privacy, and choice to share a room. This should've been communicated by MIL before she booked the room. For her to say you are ungrateful seems like an attempt at emotional manipulation.", "NTA - it\u2019s kinda weird but maybe MIL was trying to be thoughtful. Thank her for the kind gesture but say you already have your lodging covered, not refundable if you have to go there.", "NTA, they didn\u2019t bother to ask you. That\u2019s on them.", "You\u2019re 30 and way past college frat house days.  MIL should realize that.  NTA", "You didn't do anything wrong. They made a decision without running it by you first. NTA.", "NTA that is a very odd sleeping arrangement for adults who can afford their own room. I would have done the same as you.", "NTA. She shouldn't have done this without asking you first. It's a really strange thing for her to expect that you would want to do this.", "Nta. While generous, personal arrangements like that should be discussed before booking.  Your partner needs to have your back on this. \"We so appreciate that you thought of us mom,  but we're going to book our own room so that everyone has their privacy. \"", "NTA- you are an adult and paying for yourself. Thank her for the nice gesture but say you have booked your own room", "Totally NTA!  You\u2019re an adult and you get to make your own reservations!!  If she got ticked off about you declining the reservation she made for you (and she never asked, she just did it), that\u2019s just too bad.  Maybe she should ask another adult (?!) before making reservations for them.\n\ngo and have fun and get your own room.", "NTA it is not ungrateful to refuse something you never asked for or wanted and makes you uncomfortable. She is annoyed because she is trying to control the situation. If you get your own room, she cant.", "NTA\n\nAs long as you're willing to pay for your own hotel room, I don't see the problem.  Maybe your MIL has to feel in control over everything related to the wedding?\n\nYour MIL is the AH here for insisting you share a hotel room with your partner's sister and her husband.", "NTA- bunking up together is for kiddie sleep overs or frat parties, not two grown ass couples who need their own space.\n\nI\u2019m guessing MIL still sees her kids as the former or latter.", "Snoring could keep you from getting a good nights sleep \u2026 definitely not the asshole.  I value my sleep too. \nControlling people are annoying af.", "NTA. She\u2019s ungrateful if any one is, you\u2019re doing everyone a favor, now the other couple can have a room to themselves and everyone can have their privacy like most adults enjoy\u2026 I would never stay in the same hotel room as another adult couple related or not, we very much like our privacy. This is another example of someone taking something personal and getting offended when it had nothing to do with them or their actions\u2026 so sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA\n\nYou were not asked if you were okay sharing a room. You were not asked if you wanted them to make a reservation at all.  It is not ungrateful to say no thanks we'll just get our own room. You are all adults and it is a bit odd to expect married couples to share a room.", "Nta as long as you were actually appreciative. \"Thank you so much for the room. However, we'd prefer a private room so we'll pay for it, and this way SIL and husband get their own room, too\". Vs \"No. We don't want to sleep with other people. What were you thinking?\"", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHis is easy: get your own room, and ignore them. Tell them THEY can share the room with BIL themselves.", "NTA.\n\nUm. You\u2019re paying for it. What\u2019s the big deal?", "NTA", "NTA. What kind of bullshit is that?  No 30 year old couple wants to share a room with another couple.

NTA.\n\nOP, your husband needs to contact his mother and tell her that you two will be paying for your own room. He should get his sister on board, too. If MIL pushes and fusses tell him to bring up your sex life. It'll shut her down. \n\nA simple: \"Mom, we are both married couples. My wife and I will likely want to have sex at some point and I'm sure sister and her husband will want to, too. That is not appropriate in a shared room.

Just because everyone else tiptoes around her for fear of being guilted out of their minds, doesn\u2019t mean you have to. I wouldn\u2019t.

Its not weird for a married couple to want PRIVACY!!", "NTA, I wouldn't be able to sleep in that scenario, getting ready would be stressful, and god forbid you set the precedent that you're fine with this and get stuck doing it for every family event and vacation.", "NTA\u2026 Thats just weird & I\u2019m sure your partner, SIL & her partner all agree.\n\nPrivacy is a necessity.", "What?? Your MIL expects two adult couples to share what's essentially a bedroom? That's weird af. It's making me incredibly uncomfortable, and I'm not even in that situation. NTA.\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't discuss it further with the MIL. Figure out a second room amongst yourselves. I'd imagine your SIL and her husband are equally uncomfortable, and may have already booked a room too.", "NTA but your partner is a coward for even allowing that to happen in the first place or being the one to say absolutely not after you found out. It\u2019s also creepy as hell that his sister and her husband are going along.   \n\nAdult couples sharing a hotel room is not normal.  You have nothing to feel bad about but I would really question how much time you want to spend around people like that.", "Definitely NTA, but why is this all going through you? \nIt should absolutely be your partner\u2019s job to tell his mom the very reasonable information that you two will be getting your own hotel room.", "NTA. I\u2019m not a dramatic person but I would not share a room with my BIL and his wife outside of an emergency. It\u2019s ridiculous for anyone to care that you\u2019re paying for your own room.", " Nta. It's weird your MIL thought that it would be fine. Also you said you'd pay for another room so what is she complaining about.", "Definitely NTA. There are very few people I\u2019d share a hotel with\u2026 another adult couple is definitely not one of them!", "NTA.

Except she rented a multi room condo for them, my sister and her family, and me and my son. I don't exactly play well with my family because my mom is overwhelming and overbearing and I call her out on it where as everyone else is in the \"don't rock the boat\" category.\n\nI drove the 4 hours to the wedding, and then the 4 hours back afterwards instead of staying the night in an enclosed space with them. My son stayed to play with his cousins though. But I saved myself a night of hating my life lol.", "NTA. I would not be happy with that sleeping situation either.", "NTA.  Get your own room.  This sounds like some kind of power play on her part. And, yes, it's very weird.", "NTA. I\u2019m absolutely with you in this one.

That's super weird if your MIL to even book without asking you first.", "NTA", "NTA. I would personally find it difficult to even get to sleep in a room with another couple in it.

My husband isnt afraid of standing up to his mom at all", "She really only offered to pay for half a room for OP.", "I guess I did write this like I\u2019m the one handling it he is equally as involved maybe I should have put are we the asshole lol he\u2019s not afraid to stand up for himself we\u2019re just both frustrated about it and I wanted outside opinions", "Let him get to it then.

I couldn\u2019t breathe we stayed with her because she used scented detergent, scented fabric softener, fragrance satchels, air freshener. Ended up  sleeping with the window open in 27\u00b0F weather so I could breathe properly.

I\u2019m glad he hasn\u2019t left you to handle this alone. \nYou are not the AHs!
