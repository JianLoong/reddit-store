A drunk driver hit her on her way home from work. It hit me like a ton of bricks and after intense therapy, life seemed okay, well that was until Lorraine. Lorraine was a pain in my ass. She had no money, no empathy, but much disdain for me. She also had two daughters: Mallory (10) and Rebekah (13). They were spawns of satan. They would destroy my things when I wasn't home and when I'd complain to my dad, Lorraine was always there to defend them. My dad never really took my side in these arguments, and for years, I chalked it up to him not being in the right state of mind after my mom died. But sooner or later, I moved on, and my dad never did. Thus began a cycle of Mallory and Rebekah's constant abuse, Lorraine's lies, and my dad's obliviousness.\n\nI was 15 when they got married and when Mallory and Rebekah transferred to my school. They made it their mission to humiliate me. One evening, while I was out with friends, they logged into my computer and found private images I had sent to my boyfriend. The next day, there was a review posted to my school's page with 1 star and the image reading, \"would bump up the rating if this whore got expelled\". The photo was live for three hours, enough time for kids to save and share it, leading the school to consider expulsion. In an unusual move, my dad defended me for the first time. I got a week's suspension, while Mallory and Rebekah got off scot-free. I ended up dropping out and was home-schooled by a tutor my dad paid generously for.\n\nLorraine hated that my dad spent money on me so she convinced him to write up a new will. He left half of his assets and estate to me and the other half to her and her kids to share. Although she tried arguing for it all, my dad wouldn't budge. I am now 18 and a few weeks ago, my dad passed away due to covid. When my dad's safe was opened, the will was nowhere in sight. Lorraine has been accusing me but cannot provide proof. This is because I do not have it and do not know what happened to it. My uncle came forward with my dad's previous will, where he left me everything. Without proof of the new will, Lorraine cannot legally inherit anything.\n\nNotably, Lorraine's severe shopping addiction left her penniless. Her family was almost homeless before my dad and without inheritance, they could end up on the streets. As much as I hate them, I feel as if I cannot leave them to most likely die hungry and poor. Lorraine's family has reached out saying that I am going to leave them homeless all because of my \"greed\" and that I am a complete asshole. I am not sure if my revenge plan is justified so help me, please.

If the money is distributed from your dad's estate the taxes are paid by the estate. If you are sole inheritor and then give to them, then his estate pays when you inherit, and then you have to pay gift tax to them. You can deduct gift tax from the gift. \n\nThere should also be an executor if the estate is large enough to really contest things. \n\nFinally wills should not be left in a safe, but given to a lawyer with copies here and there. \n\nAs for revenge or pettiness, don't be that person.

Block them on everything, don\u2019t give them any contact details, cut them out. If you\u2019re feeling very generous enough for a shared dorm hostel so they have somewhere for the night.

I certainly wouldn\u2019t make it easy on her, I\u2019d bring up the abuse, I\u2019d talk with the whole family, etc. make it clear you don\u2019t HAVE to do anything.\nIf you do help, help month to month, in a structured way.

The missing will could become a huge problem for you since your dad\u2019s widow is not even mentioned in the will that was found.  If your dad had left a will in which he specifically noted he was not leaving his widow anything (and frankly, he would have been smart to leave her a small amount to protect you), then maybe you\u2019d be okay.  As it stands right now, depending on where you are, she may have grounds to contest the will.  Be proactive and get on this right away.\n\nNTA because I totally understand your reasons, but I\u2019m worried it\u2019s going to backfire on you in a spectacular fashion.

Your father never made a new will or never made it official, hence why your uncle had the previous will.  He never recovered from your mom passing and didn\u2019t know how to get rid of Lorraine.

They want you to honor a will that doesn\u2019t seem to exist anymore if it ever did. There is a chance your father just wanted to shut up StepMonster and he told her he did a will but his intent was never to enact it and to leave it all to you etc. you don\u2019t know and you can\u2019t be sure. What you can be sure of is this person and her spawn have no regard for you and you are unlikely to want a long term relationship with them going forward, so legally and morally you are in the clear. She is an adult and she will make decisions that are best for her and her children.

Please honor & respect that", "NTA she wouldn't hesitate if it was the other way around. But be ready for her to contest the will. You need to retain a lawyer.

There are so many ways this could go bad for her, even if she were to try to split the inheritance. They sound vindictive and they will try to find a way to screw her.\n\nNTA OP whatever you decide, but for God's sake get an attorney right now. If your uncle has the previous will maybe he can recommend the attorney who drew it up. If no attorney was involved then it's even more crucial that you get one now.", "Drawn up or not, a man who can make a will can also change his mind and tear it up.", "YWNBTA-My vote is that Dad destroyed the will, too.  He made the will to appease his wife but had an Aha moment after and did right by his child.  \n\nI disagree with offering a settlement. It may be construed as OP concedes that they deserve a share.  OP needs the lawyer's advice on that.", "It does. If the dad worked with an attorney to make the will, which is fairly common, the attorney would also have kept a copy.", "I respectfully disagree with this. It sounds like Dad said he would change the will to keep the peace.

But I'd prefer it if my brother had done the right thing.", "it sounds more like he\u2019s jumping at the chance to protect you.", "Yep. They should take up a collection amongst themselves.", "Yes, this. My understanding is (IANAL) that wills that leave out a plausible beneficiary entirely are contestable. If the legatee gives beneficiary A one hundred bucks, it tells the court that they weren't forgotten, and that $100 was the amount they were valued at. But a will that leaves a widow out entirely can be contested on the grounds that it must be obvious that a mistake was made, and it can be tied up in court until lawyers eat the entire estate. \n\nI concur. GET A LAWYER, now!", ">Is there any chance that he might have been the custodian of both wills, and decided to lose the one with her name in it?\n\nLOL. That's a real possibility. I mean, if he had one will, surely he'd have been given the new one."]}
