A drunk driver hit her on her way home from work. It hit me like a ton of bricks and after intense therapy, life seemed okay, well that was until Lorraine. Lorraine was a pain in my ass. She had no money, no empathy, but much disdain for me. She also had two daughters: Mallory (10) and Rebekah (13). They were spawns of satan. They would destroy my things when I wasn't home and when I'd complain to my dad, Lorraine was always there to defend them. My dad never really took my side in these arguments, and for years, I chalked it up to him not being in the right state of mind after my mom died. But sooner or later, I moved on, and my dad never did. Thus began a cycle of Mallory and Rebekah's constant abuse, Lorraine's lies, and my dad's obliviousness.\n\nI was 15 when they got married and when Mallory and Rebekah transferred to my school. They made it their mission to humiliate me. One evening, while I was out with friends, they logged into my computer and found private images I had sent to my boyfriend. The next day, there was a review posted to my school's page with 1 star and the image reading, \"would bump up the rating if this whore got expelled\". The photo was live for three hours, enough time for kids to save and share it, leading the school to consider expulsion. In an unusual move, my dad defended me for the first time. I got a week's suspension, while Mallory and Rebekah got off scot-free. I ended up dropping out and was home-schooled by a tutor my dad paid generously for.\n\nLorraine hated that my dad spent money on me so she convinced him to write up a new will. He left half of his assets and estate to me and the other half to her and her kids to share. Although she tried arguing for it all, my dad wouldn't budge. I am now 18 and a few weeks ago, my dad passed away due to covid. When my dad's safe was opened, the will was nowhere in sight. Lorraine has been accusing me but cannot provide proof. This is because I do not have it and do not know what happened to it. My uncle came forward with my dad's previous will, where he left me everything. Without proof of the new will, Lorraine cannot legally inherit anything.\n\nNotably, Lorraine's severe shopping addiction left her penniless. Her family was almost homeless before my dad and without inheritance, they could end up on the streets. As much as I hate them, I feel as if I cannot leave them to most likely die hungry and poor. Lorraine's family has reached out saying that I am going to leave them homeless all because of my \"greed\" and that I am a complete asshole. I am not sure if my revenge plan is justified so help me, please.

Sounds like those three need to get their shit together.", "NTA. Your stepmom is and adult, her kids are older, and she can support herself.

Your dad may have reconsidered and destroyed the new will intentionally.

If the money is distributed from your dad's estate the taxes are paid by the estate. If you are sole inheritor and then give to them, then his estate pays when you inherit, and then you have to pay gift tax to them. You can deduct gift tax from the gift. \n\nThere should also be an executor if the estate is large enough to really contest things. \n\nFinally wills should not be left in a safe, but given to a lawyer with copies here and there. \n\nAs for revenge or pettiness, don't be that person.
