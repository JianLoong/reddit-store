She told me it's going to be at this fancy high end place.\n\nShe knew I have this expensive watch because she was shocked when I told her it costs $6000 to service it. She couldn't understand how an old watch would cost $6000 (her own words). I told her that's the servicing cost, the watch itself would cost at least $10000 (I think. I am not a watch expert). She told me she wanted to borrow the watch for the wedding 2 weeks before the wedding. I said yes but I am worried she might mishandle the watch. She would say 'that old watch', 'how can an ugly watch costs $6000' or 'stupid luxury watch frenzy'.\n\nYesterday (3 days before the wedding) she came to take the watch. I told her I don't feel comfortable giving her the watch. We got into an argument. She said I care more about the watch than her. She said it's just a watch. I told precisely that how she refers to it as just a watch or that old watch that I don't feel comfortable giving her the watch. She left and told me don't bother calling her until I am willing to lend her the watch.\n\nAITA\n\nEdit\n\n1. It's around 38mm. So it's not too big.
