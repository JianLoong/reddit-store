She told me it's going to be at this fancy high end place.\n\nShe knew I have this expensive watch because she was shocked when I told her it costs $6000 to service it. She couldn't understand how an old watch would cost $6000 (her own words). I told her that's the servicing cost, the watch itself would cost at least $10000 (I think. I am not a watch expert). She told me she wanted to borrow the watch for the wedding 2 weeks before the wedding. I said yes but I am worried she might mishandle the watch. She would say 'that old watch', 'how can an ugly watch costs $6000' or 'stupid luxury watch frenzy'.\n\nYesterday (3 days before the wedding) she came to take the watch. I told her I don't feel comfortable giving her the watch. We got into an argument. She said I care more about the watch than her. She said it's just a watch. I told precisely that how she refers to it as just a watch or that old watch that I don't feel comfortable giving her the watch. She left and told me don't bother calling her until I am willing to lend her the watch.\n\nAITA\n\nEdit\n\n1. It's around 38mm. So it's not too big.

It doesn't matter if it's a luxury item or some cheap item, others should respect the sentimental value. \n\nOP needs to put the watch in a safe deposit box or something similar for a time. Then, think about this relationship. Because ultimatums are never a good thing, especially combined with disrespect", " I'm glad/sad I'm not the only one thinking it.", "Stolen bot comment    \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14im0g7/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_gf_to_wear_my/jpgpdzg?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "OP is best off if he cuts her out of his life.", "Bot    \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14im0g7/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_gf_to_wear_my/jpgpar3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "I would be uneasy about continuing a relationship with someone who told me lend me your valuable item or don\u2019t talk to me.", "Do yourself a favor & put the watch in a safety deposit box or a lock box.", "NTA. It's funny that only after you revealed its value to her she wants to hold on to and presumably wear a men's watch that she has otherwise called ugly and stupid to a wedding it seems like you may or may not even be invited to. \n\nDon't let that watch out of your sight.", "That's unusually large for a woman's watch, and way too large for a woman's watch at a formal event. (Women's fine jewelry watches get smaller, not larger, than normal.)\n\nBesides which, *if she thinks it's ugly, she doesn't want to wear it to dress up.*\n\nDo not let her touch that watch, and make sure you have it stored somewhere safe \u2013 preferably in a safe (a large one, that she couldn't possibly transport) or safety deposit box. Because I guarantee you that she didn't just want to wear it; she found out what it's likely worth, and she was going to \"accidentally lose\" it.\n\nAlso, please have it appraised and get it insured.", "That sounds ridiculous. It's obvious she only wants to wear the watch so that she can brag to her friends about how expensive it is. She obviously doesn't know anything about watches, including how to care for them, and her carelessness could end up destroying it. She has no respect for your grandfather's watch, just its value. Not to mention the danger she'd be putting herself in by walking around with something so expensive, while telling everyone how expensive it is, it will be a miracle if someone doesn't try and steal it. If she wears it they'll all be trying to get a look at it, trying to touch it, maybe even trying it on, like it's nothing more than a toy. I doubt that's something you want. Something that expensive should not be lying around your house, you should have insurance at least.", "How is wearing a men's watch that very few people would recognize as expensive \"dressing up\"? Is she planning to tell people how much it costs? Sounds rude and snobbish.", "I know about these watches because my husband is obsessed with high end watches. Do NOT lend that piece to her. This whole thing is weird and not normal. No is a complete sentence.", "Why does she want to wear it if she called it ugly??", "Nah 38mm is too big for women's formal wear. (I used to work in luxury fashion) - women's watches average around 28-32mm and can go much smaller when they dress up for stuff.  35mm is considered a \"unisex\" size but would generally be casual or large on the woman unless she was very tall. This was a man's watch that she considers ugly that she only became interested in when she found out the lowball value.  \n\nI would immediately take it to get it appraised, insured and then put in a safe deposit box. And NOT a stand alone home safe that can be picked up and taken away. I'm pretty sure it's worth much more than the amount you told her.\n\nI'm gonna be charitable and assume she wasn't planning to steal it - she likely just wanted to brag about its value to friends and would end up scuffing the crap out of it,  damaging or someone she knows would target her and steal it.  She clearly doesn't care about its sentimental value and only about the monetary worth.", "Unless the bride has some sort of vintage watch aesthetic, I can\u2019t imagine this will blend.  Have it appraised, unsure it, but lock it up so she can\u2019t get to it!", "The price of several nice cars. The watch could be worth several hundred thousand dollars if not more due to the fact it\u2019s vintage.", "NTA although you should have said no to begin with. That was a mistake but it doesn\u2019t make you the AH here.", ">Also, no one pays any attention at a wedding at what the bridesmaid's jewelry looks like\n\nMy whole thing is generally, a full set of jewelry for the day is what is gifted to the bridesmaids by the bride, so why does she need the watch? While no one in particular pays attention to bridesmaids jewelry it can impact the overall cohesive look of the day.\n\nBut asking to borrow the watch definitely doesn't make any sense", "No one is even supposed to pay attention to the bridesmaids, because the wedding is supposed to be about the bride.", "My thought too, otherwise why would she be so insistent to wear an \u201cold ugly watch\u201d with her Bridesmaids dress. That bad boy would just conveniently fall off and get lost because it\u2019s sooooo old. \n\nOP you are NTA, put that watch somewhere safe.", "Especially not a man's watch. I could see a dainty watch with gems or something.", "NTA and dump her! The whole thing is bizarre.", "This is the problem. Stop bullshitting and just be assertive; it\u2019s your watch; you can decide who wears or not, there\u2019s no reason required.", "As others have said, get it appraised, insured and locked up somewhere safe immediately.", "Yeah if it's old and ugly why does she want to ruin her outfit with it? How many people there are going to know this 'ugly' watch is a vintage luxury piece?\n\nThe guy at the pawn shop she sells it to will certainly know!", "And then he can press charges for grand larceny."]}
