As an aftermath of this, he's my parents biggest priority. They always make sure we both have everything we need, but when he breaks something, I have to give him my own stuff.

When I broke my headphones he refused to borrow me his and I had to wait 6 months to get new ones.\n\nA week ago his phone broke and he needs a new one. My mom came and asked me if I could give my brother my own phone because she can't afford one right now and that she will buy me a new one when she can. I then refused because I need one too and I bought the phone with my own money. She then said that I need to understand that he is older and needs one more than I do, she can't afford a new one right now and that she will do the same for me when I will be in college. I then got very angry and told her that while I do understand that she can't afford one right now, he's old enough to buy his own and that he's a spoiled brat. She then begged me to give him my phone and I told her that she doesn't love me and only cares about my brother. She then left the room crying.  We are struggling with money right now and I feel very guilty for making my mom sad over this, but I'm sick of having to give him everything I have when he breaks his own stuff.\n\nEdit: my brother does have a job which he can barely pay rent with since it's low income.\n\nAm i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689520286, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1518pct/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_phone_to_my_brother/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
