There is a caveat to my NTA ruling though in regards to sanitary makeup practices.\n\nThe only thing I want you to bare in mind for the future is that sharing eyeliner can be unsanitary unless you are sharpening the pencil liner/only putting a little bit of the liquid liner out and using it with separate eyeliner brushes for everyone.

It was just something fun that you guys were doing and he wanted to be involved.

Or did he just walk in, see your brother and set off/tell you that you couldn\u2019t go to the movies without you saying anything in response prior to that?

He\u2019s right, it\u2019s one thing to play with that stuff at home with kids, but if you were going to take him out while wearing makeup, you should\u2019ve asked. He may be overreacting, but I wouldn\u2019t take my young nieces *or nephews* in public with makeup on without clearing it with their parents.

Kids should be prepared for that.\n\n\nAnd your dad over reacted banning you from going out.\n\n\nBut the kid owns pink and flowers...so maybe that's not the intent, in which case, yes, YTA. Your dad's comment was that a 7 year old shouldn't wear make up (he didn't specify boy). I'm an adult woman and I HATE eyeliner. I feel like it gets in my eyes, makes me uncomfortable. As an adult, I can make that decision. Your friend is not a professional make up artist....she could make it really uncomfortable for your brother. \n\n\nAnd, presumably, they didn't buy a brand new eyeliner for your brother. This eyeliner was on your friend's eyes and then your brother's eyes. That's not safe. Putting makeup on a kid, of any gender, should 100% require asking the parents first.

Everyone in the comments created a nonexistent narrative and reacted based on their own opinions and biases, when the simple fact is that makeup is an adult accessory often to enhance features to make someone more attractive.

Long before marriage, we had the discussion of \"if our future son wants to wear nail polish, dresses, a princess backpack, it's cool,\" but the first time my 3 year old daughter asked to wear nail polish, my husband and I discussed it together....based on age, not gender.\n\n\nMake up on a 7 year old, including siblings is absolutely something that should be asked to parents first.", "Dishonest how? I come from a Christian country it\u2019s homophobia more than HALF of the time. It\u2019s the norm in my country for fathers to put their kids in a sack and hang them upside down to \u201ccorrect\u201d their thinking. I have nothing to say about child pageants l, some kids actually enjoy joining those and some kids are forced by their parents most of the time *in my country* is an attempt to put their kid in the tv industry. OP probably did not think of phoning her dad because he was probably on his way home and busy getting ready to go to the movies and wasnt expecting an over reaction from her dad", "\"A hat is not the same thing as makeup\" is just a false statement. To OP, who is also a child, she sees makeup as a normal, or at least fun thing. It's as normal as a hat. It's just self expression. She doesn't see it from YOUR perspective where it's this adult thing that requires adult permission to wear. Because she clearly wasn't taught that by her father. Adults use makeup to hide blemishes and control their appearance. Children use it for costumes and to play dress up. Makeup is used by people of all ages, it doesn't belong solely to adults. Again, it's a tool of self expression. Parents can set boundaries around it, just as they can with clothes (such as hats), but they need to set boundaries before doling out punishments. \n\nMakeup is not just an adult accessory for the sake of attractiveness, that's just your perspective. I'm sorry you feel that way about it. I don't think they put eyeliner on their brother to make him attractive, and it's creepy if that's why you think they did it. As I already pointed out, it's not always inappropriate for children, because it's often marketed towards children, for fun. \n\nShe's not the AH. She didn't know she needed to ask, her parent failed to set that boundary. She's not wrong for doing something she didn't know was wrong and couldn't have guessed was wrong, and is something that is generally not considered wrong (as you can tell by everyone else here who thinks this is an incredibly stupid reason to ground someone for.) If her father had just said \"oh sorry honey, I'm not comfortable with you putting makeup on him, don't do that again and take it off before you leave\" this whole situation wouldn't exist. I think being that he is the adult, this whole situation is his fault.\n\nIf OP knew prior that she couldn't put makeup on her brother and did it anyway, then she would be the AH. But she didn't know. She's not an asshole for it.\n\nYou are creating a non-existent scenario where OP knows it's (according to you) common sense to ask to put makeup on your sibling.", "While the things you mention are sad and do occur, there is no evidence of any of that presented in the story. We can only go off of what was given in the story, which is absolutely zero homophobia whatsoever. \n\nFurthermore, makeup is not what makes you gay. My brother is straight, despite all the dressing up, and I have plenty of gay friends who are gender conforming, and straight friends who are gender non-conforming. Your assumptions that a boy who likes to wear makeup and likes pink must be gay is\u2026 not great. Also inaccurate. He\u2019s also seven. So putting a sexuality on him at all is similarly\u2026 not great. Let kids be kids. \n\nPeople have a problem with child pageants because makeup is meant to make people more attractive, kids are not attractive, they are kids. It is often seen as sexualizing and inappropriate to parade them in public in this adultified way, which appears to be OPs fathers issue. Which you are dismissing with your own bias. OP only needed to ask, since it\u2019s not her child, she chose to do something else. That makes her the guilty party in the situation presented instead of the one you and others have invented because a boy who likes pink and makeup exists. *That* is problematic.", "It is common sense and OP said in her post \u201cI know makeup isn\u2019t usually for kids\u201d - which suggests she was very much aware (probably from being her brothers age) that makeup was an adult accessory, because it is, even if you\u2019re trying to change the meaning now. So OP was aware that this was something that likely required further discussion than a hat. So she could\u2019ve asked and chose not to. I have nieces and nephews, I would ask their parents if I wanted to do costumes or dress up or makeup in public with them, because they aren\u2019t my kids. OP can ask. \n\nThese comments are so absurd and the rationalizing is tedious. People know these things or there wouldn\u2019t be an outcry about toddlers and tiaras or dance moms or any of that stuff. They\u2019re defending this case because they decided the dad has some hang ups about a boy wearing makeup, even though he said and implied nothing of the sort. If OP wants a real opinion on the topic, she\u2019s going to have to omit the sex of her sibling elsewhere. Ridiculous.\n\nEdit: and play makeup, that is often silly and shaped like crayons, is not the same thing as adult makeup. Everyone can stop being disingenuous, especially since we know that\u2019s not what OP put on her brother.", "When the fuck did I say makeup make kids gay? I said the dad probably felt it *MIGHT* make his son gay which could explain the over reaction. You need to read better my friend. I dont know what kids pageant you\u2019ve been watching but here it\u2019s all just cutesy. Anyone who starts seeing it as kids trying to look like adults and getting turned on is sick. You are making this deeper than it needs to be. You are saying let kids be kids yet wouldnt accept the fact that kids do these stuff on a regular basis without asking their parents. Why should dad get to approve or disapprove of what kids wear? Do kids not have any autonomy over their own body?", "NTA.   If he didn't like it he could have asked you nicely to remove it or not do it again.  Not letting you go to the movies is overkill.", "The 7 year old is not a doll Ken or Barbie; maybe should have asked permission, pretty easy to do.", "NTA. If the kid wanted to dress up that\u2019s his choice. His body choice. Plain and simple. Dad is dense to think THIS is what determines his sexuality, if you put makeup on him or not.", "NTA. Your dad could be terrified of his son being gay or trans, which makes him a jerk. Or he just has very old-fashioned attitudes and needs to realise that this is the 21st century, some men wear make up and lots of women don't (I can't be bothered with make up myself).", "NTA", "NTA. Your dad is just being homophobic.", "NTA. You\u2019re dad is very homophobic.", "Your dad does the educating not you. I'm guessing you didn't know better so NTA.\n\nBut if you go against your father's wishes YTA.\n\nPutting makeup on a boy without the ability to understand gender roles and his WILLINGNESS / UNWILLINGNESS to break them is a shitty move. And at this stage of life it's the job of the parents to decide for him.\n\nSo even if you don't agree with your father and think that he looks cute in pink your father thinks his son might be confused by this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo:\n\n1. don't be a parent for children who aren't your children.\n2. Listen to your dad, he knows better than you on most things.\n3. If your dad is wrong your brother can wear pink and make up later in life, when he's made his mind about it.", "NTA.  You and your bro were going to do something fun together & he wanted to be a part of what you were all doing.  A little eyeliner really is nbd.  Most ppl I think would've laughed about it, not get pissed.  Your dad is most certainly overreacting.", "NTA\n\nThat's sad.  Your little brother was excited and having fun with his big sister and her friends!  For a 7 year old that must have been the coolest and most fun thing ever!  My youngest absolutely loves it when his older siblings, who are all 7 to 8 years older than him, do things with him.  Your dad ruined what could have been a great memory for all of you.  Your dad's insecurities ruined a whole night and a whole lot of fun.  Your dad sucks here.", "NTA. Your dad is the asshole for being pissed and punishing you. He is being unreasonable and overreacting. He is also being sexist and homophobic, implying that makeup is only for girls and that boys who wear it are somehow wrong or bad. He is not respecting your brother's choices or interests, and he is not supporting your bond with him.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, and you don't deserve to be yelled at or grounded", "NTA for the makeup, thats cute. But YTA for bringing a 7 yo to see Barbie. He wont understand most of it. \ud83d\ude2b", "Seven is too young for makeup.", "YTA it\u2019s mood good to influence kids like that. Gonna make him something he doesn\u2019t even know about. Y\u2019all making boys into girls.", "NTA: I completely agree with your POV and logic. Assuming you\u2019ve not been in a similar situation before, your dad is completely unjustified in his reaction and it\u2019s completely over the top. Whilst I get his frustration that you didn\u2019t ask, he didn\u2019t go about it the right way at all.\n\nHowever, that being said now you know your dad doesn\u2019t like it, if you don\u2019t respect that going forward then you\u2019re the AH (same applies if you\u2019d been told before). There are a number of reasons your dad may not like what happened:\n- He may feel like his son was being used (not sexually or anything but just as a joke or \u2018toy\u2019 as kids often do with younger siblings) for you and your friends entertainment. \n- He may think make-up is wrong on any kid that young.\n- He may think his son could grow up to be embarrassed that he did that/ there are pictures of that.\n- He could have cleanliness/ safety concerns.\n- He could be a homophone (100% possible).\n\nUltimately his reasoning doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s his child and if he doesn\u2019t want it to happen then you should respect that. (Assuming any co-guardian also agrees with him). You should try and notice that this is sensitive for him and anything in a similar \u2018arena\u2019, if you will, that you think might be fun to do with your younger brother would also probably warrant a check with dad.\n\nThat being said, I just want to stress I completely think he was the AH in this scenario and he overreacted, I agree with your reasoning and would not parent my son this way. My caveats were more so some advice for going forward as I do think doing something your father seems very against for his own child is wrong.", "NTA. \n\nThis is just a guess, but I suspect your dad would have reacted differently if you'd put eyeliner on a 7-year-old girl. You were including your little brother and letting him have fun with you. \n\nNot sure the Barbie movie is appropriate for a 7-year-old, but that's another matter...", "NTA. You didn\u2019t force him to dress up or put make up on. He seemed really eager to dress up with his older sister and friend. It was themed for the movie. Dad is just being unreasonable cause \u201cboys shouldn\u2019t wear makeup\u201d nonsense he grew up with. \n\nThat being said Barbie is PG-13 and might not be appropriate for him being only 7.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nSounds like your dad is worried it will make him gay or trans. Ask your dad if he'd go gay if they put a bit of make up on him and when he says \"no\" you go \"yeah, it's almost as if it's ridiculous to think a bit of make up will change your sexuality or gender and it's nothing but a ridiculously insecurity\".", "NTA\n\nIf the make up had something dangerous to the kid so ok don't put it on him but if you are used to that brand and he old enough to not put inside his mouth so no problem\n\nI have seen a lot of kids using make up and is normal like parties having body paint for kids\n\nSo yes no problem about it\n\nI think you father is seen this like a thing against masculinity\n\nWhat makes no sense too\n\nHe is using his power as a parent for punishing you both for something he needs to see a therapist about", "Your dad is not comfortable with his masculinity and is taking it out on you and your brother NTA.", "NTA. Your dad isn't objecting to the makeup because he is a kid, he is objecting because he is a boy. Your brother is just a little boy having fun, getting into the spirit of the movie. Putting on makeup for one night is not going to turn the child gay. Little boys and girls all like to have their faces painted.", "NTA. Your dad\u2019s reaction is way over the top. If he really was only bothered by the eyeliner because of the age, he would have just said to wash it off and then let you go. But most likely that was just an excuse and he had a visceral reaction to seeing his son dressed in pink and flowers (as well as eyeliner) due to underlying homophobia.", "NTA your dad's reaction is super homophobic and not necessary.", "NTA.  He was having fun being part of the group and it was awesome if you all to include him.  Ignore your dad.", "NTA, and your Dad needs a holiday, or some good whiskey, or somethin... :)", "NTA your dad is homophobic", "Did your brother want makeup?\n\nThen no NTA.\n\nYour father sounds like he might be homophobic though.", "It's really a shame more people don't seem to know this. It's really important to be careful with anything going near the eyes regardless of gender.", "Only ONCE in my life did I borrow my friend\u2019s eyeliner. The next day, I had an eye infection so bad, I had to walk from my bedroom to the bathroom with my eyes swollen shut, blindly searching for the sink so I could wash all the goob out of my eyes to be able to see again. Never again.", "I'll bet these people are American and Dad is totally fine with 7yr old wearing face paint for Halloween >insert eye roll here<", "Oh there's a reason he's freaking out and it's called homophobia.", "That doesn\u2019t make OP an AH tho. It just means they didn\u2019t know and weren\u2019t hygienic.", "She had permission- from her sibling to put makeup on him.\n\nI highly doubt it occurred to her she needed permission to put eyeliner on him. If I was a kid I wouldn't think about it, especially if there wasn't a precedent set in the household that would contradict my decision.", "She clarified in the comments that he\u2019s made because of the brothers age, not his gender\u2026but keep making assumptions", "The dad absolutely does not \"know better\" in this instance. He took a fun bonding moment between siblings and turned it into something negative. No reasonable person thinks playing fun dressup as a 7-year old is going to have negative consequences.", "Wearing pink will not gender confuse children, they don't need to be a certain age to decide if they can wear pink lmao", "Did that put a bandaid on your balls?", "My bet: face paint is allowed in \u201cboy colors\u201d only, to play goblins or superheroes. \n\nNo pink, no rainbow, no butterflies, no sparkles. In Amurica, that\u2019s how you catch the gay.", "At 7 years old, pink eyeliner is kind of like face paint. I agree to be cautious when sharing eyeliner, for sure. But I don\u2019t have a problem with a seven year old experimenting with colorful makeup for fun. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s encouraging a full face of makeup on the kid for school everyday - which I agree wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for any seven year old. But this is just a little bit of dress-up. It reminds me of when I was around that age on Halloween. My mother would\u2019ve never allowed daily makeup when I was 7, and rightly so, but I did get to wear some sparkly eyeshadow on Halloween to go with my Glinda the good witch costume, as a fun little treat. This seems similar to that.", "Something tells me dad wouldn't have thought about the hygiene aspect of it, unless he wears makeup as well? \n\nI get the feeling this is more about traditional (toxic) masculine ideas.", "He\u2019ll get over it, don\u2019t worry, just ride it out. As a younger brother, I can say it\u2019s a right of passage to have stuff like that done to you \ud83d\ude02 don\u2019t buy into the Reddit PC madness, your dad is just looking out for your brother. I\u2019m kinda jealous my sister didn\u2019t get grounded now\u2026", "Putting make up on a child to sexualise them is pretty dodgy, but there is a difference, fun make up does not sexualise a child of any gender. My daughter had a palette of rainbow colours, including yellow and green lipstick that she loved to play with when she was about 3. That is nothing like the adult style make up worn in beauty pageants. \n\nKids cover themselves in make up every Halloween \n\nI would argue that the weirdness lies with any adult that gets turned on rather than in the kids having fun.", "I'm a sensible parent and I put whiskers on my boys (7 & 5) with eyeliner because it's cute and funny. They also use blush sometimes so we can pretend to be george washington and friends. Loosen up or your kids will may end up repressed as hell.", "I'm not convinced that's really it. I'd want to know if the dad would have kicked off if a seven year old girl had tried make up.", "Nail polish doesn't carry the same infection risk that shared eyeliner does. And yes, I've had friends who had makeup done by their older sisters, and I've also seen their parents yell at said sisters for not asking sometimes. The reality is, every household is different, and the parents get to set the rules. \n\nI get the feeling OP knew this wasn't going to go over well since she had her brother ask for permission to do to the movies, but not for the makeup.", "Nobody said anything about sexualising kids or getting turned in. Jfc, you've got terminal reddit brain. \n\nThere's health risks in sharing eye makeup.", "Ah but even as an autistic person I got the subtext so wtf is wrong with you", "Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re not convinced, if he told her it was because of age I\u2019m inclined to believe it until she says otherwise\u2026you can\u2019t go around making huge assumptions when the evidence points in the opposite direction", "A 7 year old can absolutely consent to certain things, not things they don\u2019t understand the weight of of course, but eyeliner isn\u2019t one of things. It\u2019s pink paint, nothing more, nothing less. It goes on, doesn\u2019t hurt, washes off. A 7 year old can fully understand what the experience, pros, and cons of eyeliner will be. If you think a child can\u2019t consent to that then face painting booths must really piss you off.", "Or OP didn\u2019t realize it would be an issue, because it\u2019s incredibly normal to put a little fun make up on your younger siblings if they ask. Genuinely don\u2019t know someone who *didn\u2019t* do that with their older sisters growing up and none of them got in trouble. If it\u2019s a problem for OP\u2019s dad, he should\u2019ve mentioned it earlier.", "Except you [didn\u2019t](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c1l8n/aita_because_i_put_makeup_on_my_little_brother/jttqu45/). OP has confirmed. Everyone can stop making up their own narratives now.", ">Genuinely don\u2019t know someone who didn\u2019t do that with their older sisters growing up and none of them got in trouble.\n\nSounds like their household has different rules than OP's!", "How old is OP? I know as an adult not put makeup on my nieces without their parents\u2019 permission and I know not to share applicators, but when I was 16 it might not have been the first thing on my mind since makeup does seem pretty harmless", "Yes, which is why OP\u2019s dad should\u2019ve said that earlier. Rules on when to use makeup should come with buying the makeup, not added later.", "It's also pretty nice of OP to include her little brother in the thing she's doing with her friends, so definitely NTA.", "If the dad didn\u2019t have any (presumably older) siblings who used makeup growing up, it\u2019s unlikely they would have thought to have made this a rule. If he had have come in, saw what happened,  decided he wasn\u2019t cool with it and then stopped it whilst keeping a level head I doubt OP would even be posting this.\n\nThe dad\u2019s mistake (and why I say he\u2019s the AH) is his reaction to what was clearly an innocent and ignorant mistake. It was over the top and unnecessary.", "Did you have siblings growing up?", "Yes. And I never would have put makeup on my little brother without asking my parents. \n\n\nMy 3 year old knows to ask me before giving my 1 year old things, unless it's a toy she knows we always let him play with.", "So OP knows it's not as common for kids to wear makeup, but, presumably she is a child who wears makeup herself, unless she took the makeup from her father. That doesn't then indicate she needed permission to wear it.\n\nI'm not changing the meaning. Makeup isn't inherently an adult thing, it's used by all ages for different purposes. YOU would ask a parent to put makeup on their kids. Because you are an adult and you know you can't do something to someone else's kids without parental permission because you never know how a parent will feel about it. OP is a child, who doesn't see things this way, and also it was her sibling, not some other family's child. There isn't a precedent set in her household about this (until now).\n\nPlay makeup works the same as real makeup. You get color pallets and tools to apply the makeup. She put pink eyeliner on her brother? That's as good as putting on some bright glittery blue eyeshadow for fun. The only difference between kids makeup and adult makeup, is who it's marketed for and of course quality control."]}
