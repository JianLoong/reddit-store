There is a caveat to my NTA ruling though in regards to sanitary makeup practices.\n\nThe only thing I want you to bare in mind for the future is that sharing eyeliner can be unsanitary unless you are sharpening the pencil liner/only putting a little bit of the liquid liner out and using it with separate eyeliner brushes for everyone.

It was just something fun that you guys were doing and he wanted to be involved.

Obviously, I wasn\u2019t there for this argument, but I have a sneaking suspicion that you were told you couldn\u2019t go to the movie after arguing with your father about the makeup situation\u2026. Did you and your father argue back and forth before he said no movie? Or did he just walk in, see your brother and set off/tell you that you couldn\u2019t go to the movies without you saying anything in response prior to that?

He\u2019s right, it\u2019s one thing to play with that stuff at home with kids, but if you were going to take him out while wearing makeup, you should\u2019ve asked. He may be overreacting, but I wouldn\u2019t take my young nieces *or nephews* in public with makeup on without clearing it with their parents. I certainly wouldn\u2019t do adult makeup for the public at all, drawing cat whiskers is an entirely different ball game to adult looking makeup.", "ESH \n\n\nYour dad's comments probably came from a place of \"boys shouldn't wear make up\". In which case, he sucks. It's important for kids to learn it's okay....but also to learn that it's not necessarily socially accepted and might come with unwanted comments. Kids should be prepared for that.\n\n\nAnd your dad over reacted banning you from going out.\n\n\nBut the kid owns pink and flowers...so maybe that's not the intent, in which case, yes, YTA. Your dad's comment was that a 7 year old shouldn't wear make up (he didn't specify boy). I'm an adult woman and I HATE eyeliner. I feel like it gets in my eyes, makes me uncomfortable. As an adult, I can make that decision. Your friend is not a professional make up artist....she could make it really uncomfortable for your brother. \n\n\nAnd, presumably, they didn't buy a brand new eyeliner for your brother. This eyeliner was on your friend's eyes and then your brother's eyes. That's not safe. Putting makeup on a kid, of any gender, should 100% require asking the parents first.

Adultifying children is inappropriate to most people, makeup is generally used by adults to make their facial features more attractive.

Everyone in the comments created a nonexistent narrative and reacted based on their own opinions and biases, when the simple fact is that makeup is an adult accessory often to enhance features to make someone more attractive.

Long before marriage, we had the discussion of \"if our future son wants to wear nail polish, dresses, a princess backpack, it's cool,\" but the first time my 3 year old daughter asked to wear nail polish, my husband and I discussed it together....based on age, not gender.\n\n\nMake up on a 7 year old, including siblings is absolutely something that should be asked to parents first.", "Dishonest how? I come from a Christian country it\u2019s homophobia more than HALF of the time. It\u2019s the norm in my country for fathers to put their kids in a sack and hang them upside down to \u201ccorrect\u201d their thinking. I have nothing to say about child pageants l, some kids actually enjoy joining those and some kids are forced by their parents most of the time *in my country* is an attempt to put their kid in the tv industry. OP probably did not think of phoning her dad because he was probably on his way home and busy getting ready to go to the movies and wasnt expecting an over reaction from her dad", "\"A hat is not the same thing as makeup\" is just a false statement. To OP, who is also a child, she sees makeup as a normal, or at least fun thing. It's as normal as a hat. It's just self expression. She doesn't see it from YOUR perspective where it's this adult thing that requires adult permission to wear. Because she clearly wasn't taught that by her father. Adults use makeup to hide blemishes and control their appearance. Children use it for costumes and to play dress up. Makeup is used by people of all ages, it doesn't belong solely to adults. Again, it's a tool of self expression. Parents can set boundaries around it, just as they can with clothes (such as hats), but they need to set boundaries before doling out punishments. \n\nMakeup is not just an adult accessory for the sake of attractiveness, that's just your perspective. I'm sorry you feel that way about it. I don't think they put eyeliner on their brother to make him attractive, and it's creepy if that's why you think they did it. As I already pointed out, it's not always inappropriate for children, because it's often marketed towards children, for fun. \n\nShe's not the AH. She didn't know she needed to ask, her parent failed to set that boundary. She's not wrong for doing something she didn't know was wrong and couldn't have guessed was wrong, and is something that is generally not considered wrong (as you can tell by everyone else here who thinks this is an incredibly stupid reason to ground someone for.) If her father had just said \"oh sorry honey, I'm not comfortable with you putting makeup on him, don't do that again and take it off before you leave\" this whole situation wouldn't exist. I think being that he is the adult, this whole situation is his fault.\n\nIf OP knew prior that she couldn't put makeup on her brother and did it anyway, then she would be the AH. But she didn't know. She's not an asshole for it.\n\nYou are creating a non-existent scenario where OP knows it's (according to you) common sense to ask to put makeup on your sibling.", "While the things you mention are sad and do occur, there is no evidence of any of that presented in the story. We can only go off of what was given in the story, which is absolutely zero homophobia whatsoever. \n\nFurthermore, makeup is not what makes you gay. My brother is straight, despite all the dressing up, and I have plenty of gay friends who are gender conforming, and straight friends who are gender non-conforming. Your assumptions that a boy who likes to wear makeup and likes pink must be gay is\u2026 not great. Also inaccurate. He\u2019s also seven. So putting a sexuality on him at all is similarly\u2026 not great. Let kids be kids. \n\nPeople have a problem with child pageants because makeup is meant to make people more attractive, kids are not attractive, they are kids. It is often seen as sexualizing and inappropriate to parade them in public in this adultified way, which appears to be OPs fathers issue. Which you are dismissing with your own bias. OP only needed to ask, since it\u2019s not her child, she chose to do something else. That makes her the guilty party in the situation presented instead of the one you and others have invented because a boy who likes pink and makeup exists. *That* is problematic.", "It is common sense and OP said in her post \u201cI know makeup isn\u2019t usually for kids\u201d - which suggests she was very much aware (probably from being her brothers age) that makeup was an adult accessory, because it is, even if you\u2019re trying to change the meaning now. So OP was aware that this was something that likely required further discussion than a hat. So she could\u2019ve asked and chose not to. I have nieces and nephews, I would ask their parents if I wanted to do costumes or dress up or makeup in public with them, because they aren\u2019t my kids. OP can ask. \n\nThese comments are so absurd and the rationalizing is tedious. People know these things or there wouldn\u2019t be an outcry about toddlers and tiaras or dance moms or any of that stuff. They\u2019re defending this case because they decided the dad has some hang ups about a boy wearing makeup, even though he said and implied nothing of the sort. If OP wants a real opinion on the topic, she\u2019s going to have to omit the sex of her sibling elsewhere. Ridiculous.\n\nEdit: and play makeup, that is often silly and shaped like crayons, is not the same thing as adult makeup. Everyone can stop being disingenuous, especially since we know that\u2019s not what OP put on her brother.", "When the fuck did I say makeup make kids gay? I said the dad probably felt it *MIGHT* make his son gay which could explain the over reaction. You need to read better my friend. I dont know what kids pageant you\u2019ve been watching but here it\u2019s all just cutesy. Anyone who starts seeing it as kids trying to look like adults and getting turned on is sick. You are making this deeper than it needs to be. You are saying let kids be kids yet wouldnt accept the fact that kids do these stuff on a regular basis without asking their parents. Why should dad get to approve or disapprove of what kids wear? Do kids not have any autonomy over their own body?"]}
