It was just something fun that you guys were doing and he wanted to be involved.

Or did he just walk in, see your brother and set off/tell you that you couldn\u2019t go to the movies without you saying anything in response prior to that?

He\u2019s right, it\u2019s one thing to play with that stuff at home with kids, but if you were going to take him out while wearing makeup, you should\u2019ve asked. He may be overreacting, but I wouldn\u2019t take my young nieces *or nephews* in public with makeup on without clearing it with their parents.

Kids should be prepared for that.\n\n\nAnd your dad over reacted banning you from going out.\n\n\nBut the kid owns pink and flowers...so maybe that's not the intent, in which case, yes, YTA. Your dad's comment was that a 7 year old shouldn't wear make up (he didn't specify boy). I'm an adult woman and I HATE eyeliner. I feel like it gets in my eyes, makes me uncomfortable. As an adult, I can make that decision. Your friend is not a professional make up artist....she could make it really uncomfortable for your brother. \n\n\nAnd, presumably, they didn't buy a brand new eyeliner for your brother. This eyeliner was on your friend's eyes and then your brother's eyes. That's not safe. Putting makeup on a kid, of any gender, should 100% require asking the parents first.

Long before marriage, we had the discussion of \"if our future son wants to wear nail polish, dresses, a princess backpack, it's cool,\" but the first time my 3 year old daughter asked to wear nail polish, my husband and I discussed it together....based on age, not gender.\n\n\nMake up on a 7 year old, including siblings is absolutely something that should be asked to parents first.", "Dishonest how? I come from a Christian country it\u2019s homophobia more than HALF of the time. It\u2019s the norm in my country for fathers to put their kids in a sack and hang them upside down to \u201ccorrect\u201d their thinking. I have nothing to say about child pageants l, some kids actually enjoy joining those and some kids are forced by their parents most of the time *in my country* is an attempt to put their kid in the tv industry. OP probably did not think of phoning her dad because he was probably on his way home and busy getting ready to go to the movies and wasnt expecting an over reaction from her dad", "\"A hat is not the same thing as makeup\" is just a false statement. To OP, who is also a child, she sees makeup as a normal, or at least fun thing. It's as normal as a hat. It's just self expression. She doesn't see it from YOUR perspective where it's this adult thing that requires adult permission to wear. Because she clearly wasn't taught that by her father. Adults use makeup to hide blemishes and control their appearance. Children use it for costumes and to play dress up. Makeup is used by people of all ages, it doesn't belong solely to adults. Again, it's a tool of self expression. Parents can set boundaries around it, just as they can with clothes (such as hats), but they need to set boundaries before doling out punishments. \n\nMakeup is not just an adult accessory for the sake of attractiveness, that's just your perspective. I'm sorry you feel that way about it. I don't think they put eyeliner on their brother to make him attractive, and it's creepy if that's why you think they did it. As I already pointed out, it's not always inappropriate for children, because it's often marketed towards children, for fun. \n\nShe's not the AH. She didn't know she needed to ask, her parent failed to set that boundary. She's not wrong for doing something she didn't know was wrong and couldn't have guessed was wrong, and is something that is generally not considered wrong (as you can tell by everyone else here who thinks this is an incredibly stupid reason to ground someone for.) If her father had just said \"oh sorry honey, I'm not comfortable with you putting makeup on him, don't do that again and take it off before you leave\" this whole situation wouldn't exist. I think being that he is the adult, this whole situation is his fault.\n\nIf OP knew prior that she couldn't put makeup on her brother and did it anyway, then she would be the AH. But she didn't know. She's not an asshole for it.\n\nYou are creating a non-existent scenario where OP knows it's (according to you) common sense to ask to put makeup on your sibling.", "While the things you mention are sad and do occur, there is no evidence of any of that presented in the story. We can only go off of what was given in the story, which is absolutely zero homophobia whatsoever. \n\nFurthermore, makeup is not what makes you gay. My brother is straight, despite all the dressing up, and I have plenty of gay friends who are gender conforming, and straight friends who are gender non-conforming. Your assumptions that a boy who likes to wear makeup and likes pink must be gay is\u2026 not great. Also inaccurate. He\u2019s also seven. So putting a sexuality on him at all is similarly\u2026 not great. Let kids be kids. \n\nPeople have a problem with child pageants because makeup is meant to make people more attractive, kids are not attractive, they are kids. It is often seen as sexualizing and inappropriate to parade them in public in this adultified way, which appears to be OPs fathers issue. Which you are dismissing with your own bias. OP only needed to ask, since it\u2019s not her child, she chose to do something else. That makes her the guilty party in the situation presented instead of the one you and others have invented because a boy who likes pink and makeup exists. *That* is problematic.", "It is common sense and OP said in her post \u201cI know makeup isn\u2019t usually for kids\u201d - which suggests she was very much aware (probably from being her brothers age) that makeup was an adult accessory, because it is, even if you\u2019re trying to change the meaning now. So OP was aware that this was something that likely required further discussion than a hat. So she could\u2019ve asked and chose not to. I have nieces and nephews, I would ask their parents if I wanted to do costumes or dress up or makeup in public with them, because they aren\u2019t my kids. OP can ask. \n\nThese comments are so absurd and the rationalizing is tedious. People know these things or there wouldn\u2019t be an outcry about toddlers and tiaras or dance moms or any of that stuff. They\u2019re defending this case because they decided the dad has some hang ups about a boy wearing makeup, even though he said and implied nothing of the sort. If OP wants a real opinion on the topic, she\u2019s going to have to omit the sex of her sibling elsewhere. Ridiculous.\n\nEdit: and play makeup, that is often silly and shaped like crayons, is not the same thing as adult makeup. Everyone can stop being disingenuous, especially since we know that\u2019s not what OP put on her brother.", "When the fuck did I say makeup make kids gay? I said the dad probably felt it *MIGHT* make his son gay which could explain the over reaction. You need to read better my friend. I dont know what kids pageant you\u2019ve been watching but here it\u2019s all just cutesy. Anyone who starts seeing it as kids trying to look like adults and getting turned on is sick. You are making this deeper than it needs to be. You are saying let kids be kids yet wouldnt accept the fact that kids do these stuff on a regular basis without asking their parents. Why should dad get to approve or disapprove of what kids wear? Do kids not have any autonomy over their own body?", "NTA.   If he didn't like it he could have asked you nicely to remove it or not do it again.  Not letting you go to the movies is overkill.", "The 7 year old is not a doll Ken or Barbie; maybe should have asked permission, pretty easy to do.", "NTA. If the kid wanted to dress up that\u2019s his choice. His body choice. Plain and simple. Dad is dense to think THIS is what determines his sexuality, if you put makeup on him or not.", "NTA. Your dad could be terrified of his son being gay or trans, which makes him a jerk.

Assuming you\u2019ve not been in a similar situation before, your dad is completely unjustified in his reaction and it\u2019s completely over the top. Whilst I get his frustration that you didn\u2019t ask, he didn\u2019t go about it the right way at all.\n\nHowever, that being said now you know your dad doesn\u2019t like it, if you don\u2019t respect that going forward then you\u2019re the AH (same applies if you\u2019d been told before). There are a number of reasons your dad may not like what happened:\n- He may feel like his son was being used (not sexually or anything but just as a joke or \u2018toy\u2019 as kids often do with younger siblings) for you and your friends entertainment. \n- He may think make-up is wrong on any kid that young.\n- He may think his son could grow up to be embarrassed that he did that/ there are pictures of that.\n- He could have cleanliness/ safety concerns.\n- He could be a homophone (100% possible).\n\nUltimately his reasoning doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s his child and if he doesn\u2019t want it to happen then you should respect that. (Assuming any co-guardian also agrees with him). You should try and notice that this is sensitive for him and anything in a similar \u2018arena\u2019, if you will, that you think might be fun to do with your younger brother would also probably warrant a check with dad.\n\nThat being said, I just want to stress I completely think he was the AH in this scenario and he overreacted, I agree with your reasoning and would not parent my son this way.

But this is just a little bit of dress-up. It reminds me of when I was around that age on Halloween.

That doesn't then indicate she needed permission to wear it.\n\nI'm not changing the meaning. Makeup isn't inherently an adult thing, it's used by all ages for different purposes. YOU would ask a parent to put makeup on their kids.

OP is a child, who doesn't see things this way, and also it was her sibling, not some other family's child. There isn't a precedent set in her household about this (until now).\n\nPlay makeup works the same as real makeup. You get color pallets and tools to apply the makeup.

Regardless of whether a 7 year should or should not have makeup does not matter. What does matter is that as the older sibling you should be responsible and not do things that are risky with your younger siblings who trust you.

Anyway, it's not OP's place to decide whether brother should go to the movie.  OP rightly told the kid to ask the parent about it.", "I'll just say that as someone with memories of situations like that, I don't look back fondly on my mom for this sort of approach. \"All these other people aren't on your side, and your mom isn't either\" was the takeaway for me and a lot of other kids that were queer or otherwise gender-nonconforming. \n\nThe other kids don't matter. You never have to see them again once you're older, but your parents are set for life. I'm thankful we're in a good spot now, but I can't say I don't still occasionally remember when those situations happened and feel sad again.", "children don't need to care about gender roles and don't need things to be unnecessarily gendered. let them be kids and have fun and do age appropriate things (like being curious about dressing up or playing around with makeup) regardless of how society has needlessly gendered them.", "> But if you go against your father's wishes...\n\nDad should make his wishes known before he punishes OP for going against them.  He didn't.  Dad is punishing OP for not reading his mind, and that is wrong.", "I agree, Dad is lying.  If it was about age he wouldn't have flown into a rage and grounded OP, he'd have just told her to go wash it off him and don't do it again.", "If you honestly think that homophobia is the problem here, then what is your argument to OP's brother having pink clothes and clothes with flowers on them?", "I seriously doubt toxic masculinity is the problem if OP's little brother has clothes that are pink or have flowers in his closet.", "Was that critical review by Ben Shapiro by any chance?

Don't be obtuse.", "That's what he said.  Do you believe him?  It's really weird that he's punishing you for what should be considered a very minor thing. \nWould he have been this angry if *you* had played dress-up with makeup at that age?", "Why?", "It's a safe assumption the dad is transphobic because he freaked out about his son wearing makeup. If the kid were a girl wearing makeup, it'd just be misogyny. Either way, the dude is no prince.", "So getting your face painted at a birthday party is wrong at 7 yrs old as well?  Because that is basically what happened here.", "Why", "Normally, a parent wouldn't get so *angry* over that.  He would just say please go wash it off and don't do it again because I think he's too young.  Instead he's furious and he's punishing OP.", "I'm sorry.  Though I hope you keep a good relationship with your brother.  It's nice when siblings get along and have fun.  Not every sister would be as welcoming to a brother asking to be included, but actually it's really nice that you did.  I hope that doesn't change though I would advise maybe just being more low key around you Dad since you've seen how he can be.\n\nIt's precious to see two good siblings and it would be a tragedy if he ruined that for both of you.  Hopefully it can bring both you closer in spite of your fathers actions.", "Fun?  What's that?  /s", "No? Kids that age do not get to make choices with their body. I can\u2019t believe this is even a question. Kids do not get to make choices for their bodies.

He has a limited amount of right to make decisions for his body, this expands as you age. Infants have very little ability to make decisions about their body, they can\u2019t decline a vaccine or decide not to wear a particular shirt. As kids get older, we give them a little more autonomy. How much or how little depends on the parents. They can choose their own clothes, many parents don\u2019t allow makeup until they\u2019re teens. Some wait a little more for things like hair dye, most restrict certain clothing like shirts that say \u201cfuck you\u201d or something. Piercings and tattoos are again a matter of certain parents or legal restrictions, this is also true of alcohol and nicotine.

Reminds me of my little brother in the early 90s screaming because my mum had got a new electric razor for her legs and wouldn't let him shave his legs too. It had nothing to do with smooth legs (because he was 6 and had no hair to shave!) or the nail paint she was putting on her toe nails, he just wanted to join in with both. To this day me and him still reminisce over the shaving tantrum :')", "I have a friend whose husband freaked out when she wanted to buy their young son a toy kitchen.\n\nHere's the thing - the dad is a chef.", "I agree with you that it's just a lot of willful ignorance that begets bigotry. But especially with the queer community a lot of the hatred stems from older people who are self-loathing. There's a psychological component to it where they hate themselves and can't stand who they really are. That's why they're causing strife, and they hate and ridicule the next generation.\n\nNow I myself am straight but it's something I've seen with friends and family members and it's a measurable discernible pattern.", "No, he saying that I didn\u2019t have a hygiene concern, it was all about not letting a boy wear pink eyeliner.", "Yup, tell her that", "I wouldnt describe \"probably homophobic\" as an amazing leap from \"becoming angry upon seeing my son in a tiny amount of makeup for a specific one'-off occasion\", tbh. It's not even a shuffle away. More like a twitch.", "Why, did it turn you gay?", "No makeup for Halloween parties!  No makeup for school plays!  No makeup when playing dress-up with sister and her friends!  No makeup ever for any reason!", "You think a child asking their sister to put makeup on them is something they shouldn't have the right to do? They don't deserve that level of autonomy? Why? How is that harmful. I can see not letting them forgo medicine, not letting them only eat unhealthy food, not letting them where something blantly offensive because those are harmful. What are you trying to protect by denying the child this?", "The evidence is his ridiculous overreaction.  Telling OP to go wash it off the kid and don't do it again is reasonable.

As I\u2019ve already pointed out several times, there is a difference between Halloween and child pageants, there is a difference between playing dress up and attending public events. As a culture, we understand these distinctions and condemn some but not others. Some make the child look more grown up than others, which many find inappropriate or concerning. For that reason, if you would like to put makeup, hair color, or other generally accepted adult products on a child, and especially take them to a public places, you ask their parents first. It\u2019s really pretty simple. I\u2019m not sure why everyone is acting like they don\u2019t understand this concept and next week they\u2019ll be on here condemning some parent who wants to put their kid in a child pageant but here we are.

That's literally the opposite of good parenting.", "except what about the kids boundries or wants? the dad's \"boundries\" trump the kid wanting to play around with makeup (which is relatively harmless) and dress up because he thinks it's \"disgusting\"?", "I believe the dad saying it's an age thing as much as I believe conservatives claiming they care about the safety of children", "Ffs even animals can consent.
