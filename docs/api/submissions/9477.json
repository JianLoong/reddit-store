You were doing what needed to care for the child.", "NTA gosh this is ridiculous. I worked with little kids with neurological differences and disabilities for a while. I wasn't related to any of them, but if they were having a hard time and came to me for comfort, of course I hugged that kid!! I held so many hands, let smaller kids sit on my lap if they needed, etc. Physical touch can be so comforting to kids- that is why they run to you for it. You were assigned a caregiver role.

Not for the affectionate care for your nephew, that was appropriate.\n\nBut for how you handled the interaction with the teacher. Teachers are given extensive training about appropriate touch and interactions in school that are warning signs for sexual misconduct. A teacher being vigilant of this is DOING THEIR JOB, and should not be reprimanded by you or anyone else for being cautious.\n\nNationally, 1 in 4 girls & 1 in 6 boys are sexually abused before age 18.\n\nThis could have been an opportunity for you to help educate them about supports for autistic children - which could help Alex and other kids down the line. Instead their takeaway is just going to be a negative interaction with an asshole parent.", "YTA. Teacher doesn\u2019t know the familial situation and was looking out for Alex. How would she know if you\u2019re on good terms with your brother and SIL or if you are even his uncle? Even with chaperones, teachers shoulder the responsibility on field trips and it can be chaotic, especially when there are students you don\u2019t know well.", "YTA. You are being defensive and making it all about you, and being a poor example for all the kids by doing the opposite of what a teacher asked of you. \n\nI hate to tell you this, but family often do the worst by smothering kids with special needs. \n\n- A retired  teacher", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
