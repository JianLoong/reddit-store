I don't know why your ex would not have learned Spanish by now. She has had at least 15 years to pick it up.", "I don't understand every saying YTA.\nYou actively were excluding her by not inviting her in the first place. So think you need to make a correction there.\nMaybe the drama wouldn't have ended if you had let her know prior it was only going to be you and your family, \nMaybe you should have had your daughter talk to her mom about letting her have dinner with just your family.\n\nI'm obviously in a differing opinion here. But she wasn't invited to the gathering. Probably for this similar reason. You guys aren't together anymore, and your daughter is a teenager. There's no reason she needs both parents at a one side of the family get together. If it was a gathering of both families then yeah it would definitely be rude. But seeing as how she must have fought you to make sure she came to an event she wasn't invited to, even by her own daughter. Then she's the rude one.\nI think everyone saying you're the AH, are just white people thinking of themselves being in a room of foreign languages being spoken, and then getting offended at the idea that you wouldn't be accommodating to them, when English speakers are very rarely accommodating to foreign speakers.\nLike yeah it would suck to go to a gathering of people who are speaking only a language you do not understand. But that sounds like *one* of the reasons why she wasn't invited to begin with. I think it might have been more mature though to be straight with her and say it's just your family and no one will probably be speaking English. Would she go to Spain, not learn any Spanish, and then demand everyone around her start speaking English just because she's there? \n\nIdk. To me if you insist on coming to an event you were specifically not invited to, it's not anyone's job to be accommodating to you just cause you're there anyways, when you were excluded from the party to begin with.", "NTA, she harassed you then you obliged but YTA cuz you didn't translate for her", "Im going agaisnt the grain.\n\nNta\n\nMom had 15 years to learn her daughters first language, she didnt, thats where it ends for me, she refused to learn her daughter's language then threw a hissy fit when her daughters family prefered to speak their first language", "NTA People seem to be missing that Mom/Ex has had FOURTEEN YEARS to learn Spanish. What kind of parent doesn't bother to learn their child's family's preferred language after FOURTEEN YEARS?\n\nShe forced herself into your child's party and then got mad that you spoke your preferred language anyway. You could have given her a polite reminder that the family doesn't speak English as a preferred language, though, and let her decide if she really wanted to show. Sounds to me like she expected to be catered to if she showed up, even though she was neither invited nor actually wanted.", "ESH. She shouldn't have harassed you into including her but you should have stood your ground instead of letting her come then excluding her from conversation. Next time just say it's a thing with your family.", "NTA I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and assume that most people here who think you\u2019re evil doesn\u2019t speak a different language as their mother tongue. It is quite uncomfortable to switch gears from not having to think about what you\u2019re saying to having to think about it. It\u2019s uncomfortable. ESPECIALLY when you\u2019re with your family where your whole dynamic has been in Spanish since waaah. And yes, after 14 years she should have AT least become familiar with the language to understand it somewhat. She can speak English and they can answer in Spanish. It\u2019s super rude to come to a place where everyone\u2019s speaking a language they\u2019re comfortable with and expect EVERYONE to switch and become self conscious because you don\u2019t speak it. And by this point SHE knew everyone prefers Spanish and yet she assumed she could come and have everyone cater to her. \nA tiny bit mean but she pushed herself into the event so it evens out. She could have just left quietly, learned her lesson and tried to learn the language before the next event.", "Nta. But info- daughter didnt want mom to come?

I can\u2019t even wrap my head around how mean your being\u2026.. it\u2019s gonna come back and bite you in the ass\u2026..", "Then they just should have said no if the daughter didn't want her there.", ">My family and I were the ones speaking spanish and excluding my ex\n\nRead this VERY CAREFULLY.", "Ok you literally just said you were excluding you ex haha", "Mother tongue is the first language someone learns as a baby nit the language of her mom.\n\nMy daughter's mother tongue is spanish", "That's exactly the opposite of what op said.", "It\u2019s not entitled to want to be able to join a conversation at a party Jesus what has happened to people that basic human decency is entitlement nowadays", "Probably because op is encouraging the daughter to ostracise her mother, he makes it very clear she's a daddys girl and I doubt he makes his disdain for his ex a secret, so she's acting accordingly to gain his approval and make HIM happy.", "You said in a different comment you only dated for a month. So why exactly should she make that effort? Your daughter can easily grow up bilingual without her parents knowing both languages.", "She wants to be involved? Great. She can through a party for her daughter then", "The drama queen ruined it not me", "I'm not sure why y'all keep saying this. It doesn't make you look smart just does the opposite. I already explained what I meant by this", "Yes, but the daughter's mother's tongue is English. I meant it's a funny coincidence to literalize the idiom.", "The Mother speaks English.", "it is entitled to bully your way into a party where you have a pretty good idea of the language might be Spanish and then expect everyone to bow down to you. That\u2019s my point. The topic should\u2019ve been discussed by  mom and dad.  there is shared blame here", "My daughter is bilingual but she prefers spanish. It's her daughter's language she should want to learn it like I learned english for my daughter", "You're transparent. These shitty childish replies tell me everything about the poor man and father you are.", "Why do you hate the mother of your daughter?", "It\u2019s \u2018our\u2019 daughter you twit. She\u2019s shared between you and your ex wife. \n\nChrist, how did you raise a kid to be 15 and still act this much a child yourself. \n\nGrow the hell up. Your reasoning is poor, do better.", "Throw", "You're unhinged", "You know, you should just step up and be honest that you purposefully did not put any efforts into being in any way inclusive towards your ex in regards to language and that you purposefully did not speak any english. \n\nYou obviously dislike your ex very much and what you did was a petty move. But probably not the end of the world. We all can be petty and a bit of an ass sometimes. So just step up and admit it instead of trying to weasel some internet strangers into saying you\u2018re the good guy here. These lame excuses are just tiring.", "Bud you\u2019re rambling in the comments. You are the drama", "More childish insults instead of accepting responsibility. Not a man.", "You're yourself a teenager mentally. The kind of replies you're giving are making me think that either you're actually a teen pretending to be an adult and creating a false aita scenario or you're an adult who's an immature prick not maning up to his mistakes. You're infact shifting the accountability of your and your family's actions to the ex. No wonder she's your ex.She's at Good riddance from you etiquetteless folks.\n\nI wonder what kind of virtues you're instilling in your daughter(if there's one)", "You seem more the drama queen in this situation", "You realize that we\u2019re simply reading the words you typed out, right? \n\nYou don\u2019t look very smart either seeing as you keep trying to insist that \u201cwe excluded her\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that you excluded her. Ffs. \n\nYou realize that your daughter is eventually going to be old enough to look at these events through a more mature lens and see quite clearly how shitty you\u2019ve behaved, right? She\u2019s not always going to be Daddy\u2019s Girl, blinded to what he\u2019s doing. You\u2019re adversarial towards her mother, that is going to have consequences some day.", "OP never mentioned if he told her that she wasn\u2019t wanted. He just said she \u201cinsisted\u201d which can mean just her asking about it and he never said he specifically told her she wasn\u2019t wanted there. And even then even if you do not want a person there it\u2019s still impolite if you exclude them. If you have a party even if you don\u2019t like someone you should include them in some conversations, that\u2019s called being a good person and it\u2019s not entitled to expect that from people", "I'm confused here. You dated your daughter's mother for about month but you didn't know English and she didn't know Spanish. Did you both know a third language? How did you communicate if you learned English after your daughter was born (or after you knew you were going to be a parent)?", "You learned english just for your daughter? \n\nSo I assume you don\u2018t live in a country where majority of people speak english and your ex must be in the minority then. In that case, it\u2018s quite baffeling that your ex hasn\u2018t learned any spanish so far.
