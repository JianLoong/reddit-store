Mentioning your concerns is understandable, I suppose, but you should've backed off when he first asked you to. \n\nI'm sure his daughter is aware she's gained weight; she doesn't need you to point it out. You say she used to be active in high school so she's very much aware of the changes in her own body. First year of college can be rough, and some people cope with the sudden stress through food. There could also be a health issue if the weight gain has been that sudden. \n\nYou bringing up her weight isn't going to make it less stressful. It doesn't sound like you've been a mother figure in her life long enough for that to be your place. You being the one to bring it up will probably just have the opposite effect of making her more self-conscious and adding onto her stress. Leave her be. Leave the health advice for her doctor (and maybe a therapist) to handle and the concern trolling for the trashcan where it belongs.\n\nINFO: I'm also curious how/if you know for sure how many pounds she's gained? Has she mentioned it or are you guessing (and therefore inflating) the number? I'm just confused because (in my estimate, I could be wrong) she wouldn't be able to wear her old clothes anymore if she actually did gain 100lbs.

But if you push the issue, you will be. You have a concern, you voiced it, and he's set a firm boundary. Respect it.", "NTA for bringing it up, but YWBTA if you keep mentioning it. Ultimately, it's an issue between her and her dad, if you bring it up repeatedly, you'll only set yourself up to be an enemy to them both.", "Yta - the problem IS hers to fix - IF she wants to. Her arches probably hurt FROM cheerleading and dance. Back off.", "NTA but drop it. Not your problem, you inquired now let it go. If you continue, YTA", "My perspective as a healthcare professional.\nI would go to bat for her. Weight is harder to lose the older you get. 100lbs in a year is pathological not physiological.

If not, you're likely to piss off dad.", "Nta\n\nObesity is a health concern.", "Yes, you ATAH. You know what can happen to young women in college? That can lead to a woman, either consciously or unconsciously changing body? Also, even if she is just eating more... let her figure it out. Why are you so interested in how attractive she is? She's not a cheerleader or perhaps even a dancer anymore. Let her earn her education without having to be attractive to you.", "NTA for initially bringing it up, but be careful here. This could very easily backfire on you and make the situation worse. If he has a good relationship with her, hopefully he can find a nonjudgmental way to figure out what\u2019s going on and how to support. But I agree with all the comments that say now it\u2019s time to drop it.", "NTA, he needs to direct that energy at his obviously unhealthy daughter.  Excessive eating can mask so many other issues, many of them mental health related.  He needs to engage with his daughter now to make sure she's okay.", "YTA Yes your concerns about this young lady's health is validated but you should have dropped it when he told you to. She's not going to address her weight issues until she's ready to.

Not to mention there could be (and likely is) another underlying issue causing the weight gain besides the assumption that she's just \"eating badly and not exercising\". \n\n>She needs help.\n\nYes, and part of helping is knowing how to approach these situations and how not to. Dad's gf that doesn't seem to have a close relationship with the daughter telling her to exercise and eat better isn't going to help.", "Fair enough", "100% correct. We know what we need to do, we just need to get there on our own! Nagging us will make it much worse - much, much worse.", "But where did OP *get* that number? I\u2019m guessing bf\u2019s daughter hasn\u2019t come out and said, \u201cHey, I\u2019ve gained 100 lbs since high school!\u201d  I\u2019ve learned that, in general, people aren\u2019t very good at judging another person\u2019s weight. We all carry it differently and have different body types. \n\nIn the end, no matter if it\u2019s 15, 50, or 100 lbs, it\u2019s none of OP\u2019s business. This girl isn\u2019t her daughter, and she\u2019s a full grown adult capable of managing her own life.", "You guys do 4 years of University? Or is that just for your High School?", "Thank you!!!\n\nAn ADULT?!?! O/P is trying to police an adult who is very much aware of what they are putting in their mouth?\n\n YTA", "Make sure she gets the care she needs. Most women can easily tell you of a time when a provider blew off their concerns.", "I agree, do not take that advice. I guarantee she KNOWS she's gained weight, she KNOWS it's not healthy and anything you say will feel like an attack. If she wanted to talk to you about it, she'd bring it up. \n\nJesus, those of us with weight issues know we have issues and know what we need to do. Don't infantilize us.", "Care to elaborate as to why?", "Context. But yes, it's not healthy to gain 100lbs in a year, but I doubt that's even true. OP also says that the student complains about \"tight\" clothes. You can't fit into clothes if you've gained 100lbs. I think the \"health concerns\" is a way to hide a different concern. Again, because they haven't talked about WHY the student might have gained an appreciable amount of weight.", "So you say gaining a ~100 pounds in a year or two is not at all concerning? \n\nPersonally I wouldn't be able live with myself knowing that I refused to help someone who is not my blood but family nevertheless because it is socially not acceptable to confront someone about excessive overweight.", "So do nothing. Let your step daughter slowly eat herself to death. Marvelous advice.", "Yep, my mom always stressed me out because my weight and I comforted myself with food and sweets.", "A baccalaureate degree is a four year college degree.  It's the \"Standard\" degree.  BA = Arts, BS = Science, etc.  An Associate's degree is a two-year degree.\n\nSo \"traditional\" college / hs are each four years.", "Yes, most bachelor degree programs are four years.", ">I guarantee she KNOWS she's gained weight, she KNOWS it's not healthy\n\nThis is what gets me about people who act/think like OP and others. Do they think the person doesn't know/notice the weight gain? \n\nI'm also not sure how the daughter would fit into her pre-weight-gain clothes (assuming the outfits she's referring to are from a year or so ago) if she's actually gained 100lbs. They wouldn't just be snug, they wouldn't fit at all so I'm guessing OP is exaggerating the amount of weight gained.", "Your fathers girlfriend taking you out and asking you why you\u2019ve gain so much weight. Especially after the father has explicitly asked you to stop you want to then go behind his back. What about that situation sounds like it will go well? She would not only ruin the relationship with the daughter but also with her boyfriend.", "OP IS trying to talk about it. Her bf shut it down, she should respect that, but she\u2019s not an AH for bringing it up to her bf.", "Did I say that? Because I'm pretty sure the first paragraph in my comment included this:\n\n>Her bf could talk to the daughter and find out what might be going on, but definitely not OP.\n\nAnd that I also explained that SHE shouldn't be the one doing anything and why.", "Interesting, almost all courses are 3 years where I live unless you\u2019re doing a part masters degree within your course.", "That\u2019s interesting, most degrees are 3 years where I live unless you do a part masters alongside your degree. I\u2019m in my 3rd and final year of a BA in Primary Education with QTS, which is only 3 years.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking as well. Gaining 100lbs would never make clothes \u201csnug\u201d they would be impossible to even attempt to put on. I think OP exaggerated weight gain to get the NTA votes.", ">the father has explicitly asked you to stop\n\nCare to quote where it says that?", "> I asked if he had any concerns with the weight situation. He said that he isn't concerned", "most americans specialize later than people in countries with European-style higher ed. It varies from university to university (and type of institution) within the US, but for mine, I didn't \"declare my major\" --ie decide the subject of my degree--until the end of my second year. This is not uncommon. Most American universities also have general ed requirements which take up course time. The ideal goal behind it is to produce a well-rounded citizen as much as an expert in a specific career path.\n\nAlso, since primary and secondary education (elementary and high school) curricula vary vastly from state to state, first-year college students do not come in with the same degree of knowledge or even literacy/numeracy across the board.

The first year is more about getting you accustomed to University writing and life\n\nInterestingly though, all degrees in Scotland are 4 years. England and Wales they\u2019re 3 years. But you also get university for free in Scotland which you don\u2019t in the wider UK. \n\nFor us, you pick your degree and then that\u2019s it. Your university will then tell you your modules for the degree, usually about 7/8 a year. You write an essay/exam/presentation and then you pass or fail. If you fail you redo it in summer term but your grade is capped at 40% (the lowest passing grade)"]}
