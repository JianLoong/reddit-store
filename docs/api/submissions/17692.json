Invite who you want, don\u2019t invite anyone who you don\u2019t want there.\n\nFor context:  when my son got married her parents had no money, he asked me to pay for the wedding, which I did.   My only stipulation was that it was his and her wedding and no one was to try and interfere (change their minds - which was a huge issue).  It was a challenge at times and her parents at one point complained that \u201ctinkerpro is running the show, that isn\u2019t fair\u201d.   My son replied that \u201cmom has only supported our decisions, hasn\u2019t questioned anything, and only said that a few of my friends should be invited or else it all the guests would only be bride\u2019s family\u201d.   There a LOT of them.  I made sure that they got what they wanted.  I only refused to pay for the rehearsal dinner and some stupid decorations that I though were over priced.

She was the one that did the hard work and actually stayed and raised me. My dad was basically completely absent. I did invite him as a guest, and he came. Side note- he didn't attend either of my half sisters weddings (the kids he stuck around for) and had a tantrum that the younger one didn't want him walking her down the aisle. Also, he got married two years ago and still hasn't told me lol", "To me, it\u2019s the difference between sentiment and tradition. Tradition demands that your father, the man who \u201cowns\u201d you \ud83e\udd2e be the one to give you away to the next man who \u201cowns\u201c you. It\u2019s historically a handing off of property which used to come with payment\u2014no different than livestock.\n\nSentimentally, on the other hand, you can choose to take the hand of the one who has earned your trust, one who has walked beside you, guiding & supporting your steps, to the threshold of the next phase of your adult life. At the end of that walk you can confidently let go as you, a fully capable woman in charge of her own self *thankyouverymuch*, embrace a new family of your choosing. It\u2019s an *honor* not a birthright and you don\u2019t fucking owe it to anyone, least of all the asshole who abdicated the role in the first place. \n\nYour not-father fully believes it\u2019s his right to do the first one.
