It\u2019s your\u2019s and your partner\u2019s day and you shouldn\u2019t feel obliged to invite anyone regardless of if you share the same blood.

Your father has no right being with you on the most important day of your life when he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to be with you during the mundane days. It\u2019s just a status symbol to him that he feels entitled to. But it\u2019s not entitled, it\u2019s earned.

Your biological father was never in your life so don't sweat it.    Don't give into emotional blackmail from these people who are pressuring you to invite him.", "100% NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules.\n\nIt's awesome to have your brother walk you down the aisle.", "Easy. NTA.", "Definitely NTA\n\nAnyone trying to make you think otherwise needs to get in the bin, imagine thinking someone who you haven't spoken to for 5 years should do the most personal of things. He forfeited that right the moment he stopped showing up for you. I hope the people giving you trouble come to their senses and you have a fantastic day", "NTA. It doesn't matter what others want, it's about what YOU want. Your brother has been pretty much raising you right?

Or if you're not close with those harassing you, uninvite them/block them.", "NTA, it's your wedding and walking you down the aisle should be the person who's been the most like a father to you. IF you even want to indulge in that tradition at all.  This dude who thinks because he donated 1/2 of your DNA is just that: sperm donor.  Dads are there for scraped knees, school performances, broken hearts, teaching you how to change a tire. Which one sounds more like Dad?  DNA contributor or big brother?  Do yourself a favor, block everyone you can and whoops forget to drop their invitations in the mail.", "NTA. It is your wedding so you are free to choose who walks you down the aisle and who attends your wedding. Its your special day after all.", "It's your wedding. You are a grownup who made a choice to have things go a certain way. Do what you want and inform others that you only want people who support you at your wedding. They can either get on board or consider themselves uninvited. NTA", "NTA. The karma her would be to tell him he can walk you down the isle, and then take that away from him, just like he did to you when you were younger. Give him a taste of how he made you feel.", "NTA Your wedding your choice. Your Dad was never there for you. It's pretty presumptuous of him to assume that he'll be walking you down the isle. Have your brother walk you down. He may not be technically your father but he is your father.", "NTA - Tell him, 'Yeah, walk me down the aisle Dad....oh, but you won't show up just like your empty promises so I'm skipping this heartache and asked my brother who walked in when you walked out on me 16 yrs ago.\"\n\nYour sound decision will be not regretted later. This is your day; the beginning of a new life chapter. Create and enjoy what you truly want.", "Hold on so the man who decided not to give his daughter a home still thinks that he's her dad? NTA", "Meh.  Invite him as a guest.  Let your brother walk you down the aisle.  Tell all the people with opinions that you aren\u2019t interested in hearing what they think, you have made your plans and are happy with them.\n\nHappy Wedding!    And good luck, sounds like a lot of people are going to want things \u201ctheir\u201d way.  Remember, it is  YOUR and your future husband\u2019s wedding, do things the way you want.  Invite who you want, don\u2019t invite anyone who you don\u2019t want there.\n\nFor context:  when my son got married her parents had no money, he asked me to pay for the wedding, which I did.   My only stipulation was that it was his and her wedding and no one was to try and interfere (change their minds - which was a huge issue).  It was a challenge at times and her parents at one point complained that \u201ctinkerpro is running the show, that isn\u2019t fair\u201d.   My son replied that \u201cmom has only supported our decisions, hasn\u2019t questioned anything, and only said that a few of my friends should be invited or else it all the guests would only be bride\u2019s family\u201d.   There a LOT of them.  I made sure that they got what they wanted.  I only refused to pay for the rehearsal dinner and some stupid decorations that I though were over priced.  Told the bride\u2019s mother if she wanted those so bad, she could pay for them herself.", "NTA\n\nTo hell with technicalities. Technically your father was supposed to show up to your birthdays. Technically he was supposed to step up and take care of you when you became an orphan. Technically he should have given a damn about you even when he had nothing to gain from it. Whether you'll regret not inviting him or not, it's your choice to make, so do whatever feels right to you, and it's nobody's damn place to tell you what he deserves from you.", "I got my mum to walk me down the aisle. She was the one that did the hard work and actually stayed and raised me. My dad was basically completely absent. I did invite him as a guest, and he came. Side note- he didn't attend either of my half sisters weddings (the kids he stuck around for) and had a tantrum that the younger one didn't want him walking her down the aisle. Also, he got married two years ago and still hasn't told me lol", "To me, it\u2019s the difference between sentiment and tradition. Tradition demands that your father, the man who \u201cowns\u201d you \ud83e\udd2e be the one to give you away to the next man who \u201cowns\u201c you. It\u2019s historically a handing off of property which used to come with payment\u2014no different than livestock.\n\nSentimentally, on the other hand, you can choose to take the hand of the one who has earned your trust, one who has walked beside you, guiding & supporting your steps, to the threshold of the next phase of your adult life. At the end of that walk you can confidently let go as you, a fully capable woman in charge of her own self *thankyouverymuch*, embrace a new family of your choosing. It\u2019s an *honor* not a birthright and you don\u2019t fucking owe it to anyone, least of all the asshole who abdicated the role in the first place. \n\nYour not-father fully believes it\u2019s his right to do the first one. Sounds like your brother deserves to do the second. That\u2019s my hot take anyway.\n\nYou are 100% NTA, and congrats on your big day!", "I don't think you would regret it. \n\nYou would regret not letting your brother walk you down the aisle.\n\nYou wedding, your way", "NTA. I think I heard it in a song somewhere\u2026\u201dYou only get what you give\u201d.", "NTA It's your wedding, your choice and none of their business who you choose. The fact they feel entitled to voice an opinion on this issue is weird to begin with and very inappropriate.", "It's insane how they're treating you.  You are absolutely right for thinking of your brother, who was there for you, instead of your absentee dad.\n\nDon't take any of those asshole messages to heart, and remember that you don't have to respond to any of them.  You can simply close the box, leave them on read, and go on with life. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019ll regret inviting him.
