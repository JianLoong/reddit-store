This one will, too.", "Nah I think it\u2019s understandable your dad is upset. Most people nowadays just see it as a cute moment for father and daughter not something offensive.

It's your wedding and you get to choose the events and customs you include, and as you note you aren't singling this one thing out or doing this in order to hurt his feeling. Meanwhile he isn't the AH for wanting to experience it, and quite possibly it's something he has thought about and looked forward to. \n\nJust one thought that might work as a compromise... Would you consider being walked down the aisle by perhaps both parents? It's not necessarily about being 'given away' - you could repurpose the ritual entirely to instead simply be two people who love and support you, being with you as you approach this major step, commitment, milestone. Perhaps then it would feel less paternalistic and possessive.", "NTA, but I\u2019ve seen more modern weddings where both parents walk the bride down the aisle.

I asked both of my parents to walk me down the aisle, and that's what we did. No giving anyone away, just a way to include them.\n\nThere are lots of things you could do involve your dad.

I'm close to your age and my parents are dead; if something like this meant something to them and I could give it to them I just would, it wouldn't be some huge sticking point to me personally. Yeah it is antiquated and kinda ridiculous, one could even say offensive in a certain light. But it's also in practice not what it used to symbolize, it's just a tradition and a way to show respect to your dad. No, you shouldn't have to show respect this way. But if I were you I'd spend some time thinking about how important this really is to you. It's literally 30 seconds and no one else will think anything of it, but it sounds like it might mean a lot to your dad.", "NTA BUUUUT you sure could be nicer. If it means a lot to someone I love, i think i can find it in my heart to give them this memory. Maybe compromise with two or three steps instead to make it bearable? \n\nAlso Dont think of it as giving you away.\nChange the symbolism... much like they guide you on your first steps as a kid, bring you to daycare and then school... this could be more like sending you off to the next chapter of your life.", "You are NTA for not wanting to feel like you are representing 'property'\n\nBut I do agree with the posters who have said that hopefully there's room for compromise. Maybe my story might give you something to think about.\n\nI was 45 years old when I got married, and one of my most cherished memories was being walked down the aisle by my very frail 82-year-old father who recently passed from dementia. My father-in-law missed the majority of the event driving my dad to and from so he could facilitate this happening. \n\nThere's no way in heck that I am property. I know that, everyone at the wedding knew that too. It was still a lovely way for me to honor my father.\n\nAll that said, at the end of the day it is your wedding and you do you. Perhaps ask your dad to have a special part of the ceremony like a reading or something in lieu of walking you down the aisle. That might be a way to make him feel special and still stand firm to your principles", "Why don\u2019t his parents, close friend, of relatives walk him down before you? The groom is always waiting, why not have him walked down too.\n\nI had some gay friends, and they had their parents and aunts and uncles walk both of them down.\n\nAllows you to honor your dad in a way that removes the negative tradition. You can even make your husband go last and you can wait for him.", "YWBTA if you refuse to let him do it imo\n\nI agree it's an outdated tradition but if it's important to your father you should just let him do it imo. You don't want to do it because you see it as your dad \"passing ownership\" of you to your husband. You *know* your dad doesn't \"own you\" and it sounds like your relationship with him is fairly healthy, so I assume he doesn't see you as property. He just wants to walk you down the aisle \"because that's what dad's do\". I think you're making too big of a deal out of it.\n\nIf it's really SUPER important to you to communicate to everyone at your wedding that you firmly believe that you are not \"property\", (so important that you are prioritizing communicating that over \"throwing your dad a bone\") I guess don't let your dad walk you down the aisle. If you care about your dad's feelings and want him to feel like he's part of your wedding then just let him do it. It's up to you to decide if \"making a statement\" is more important than avoiding family drama and hurt feelings.", "NTA. Could you maybe find something special for him to do at the wedding so he feels included? Or how would you feel if you stopped for a kiss on the cheek at the of the end aisle before taking your place up front? (Though I do see how that could also be interpreted as \"giving you away\")", "NTA \u2014 it\u2019s your wedding.", "YTA.  He's probably looked forward to doing this with you his whole life, and you are spitting his wish to be at your side on the most important day of your life back in his face.  This is a simple compromise.  Walk down the aisle with him, give him a kiss, join your fiance, and just tell your officiant to skip saying the \"who gives this woman\" crap, which, I do agree, is outdated and icky.  But you are making it a bigger deal than it is.", "NTA, weddings should be firmly about celebrating the marriage of two people, and people inserting themselves into it so they can do what they want/ feel is right is stupid. Op is already not doing things traditionally and her dad needs to get over himself. Also, not for nothing, they\u2019re getting married in a pizza place. There isn\u2019t going to be an aisle in the traditional sense.\n\nAll the YTAs in here are full of shit", "NTA but it doesn't have to mean that. A lot of people celebrate Christmas who don't believe in Christ - you're allowed to participate in a tradition without believing in the underlying dogma. So, it's totally your choice but it'll cost you nothing to give your dad an active role he otherwise won't have.", "I don't like wedding patriarchy - but my dad and mom both walked with me - so not so much giving away as being a part of it.\n\nI get it though and you are nTA", "NTA.", "Your wedding, your rules. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHowever The very act of a wedding service is draped in tradition and symbolism.  How about a compromise?  Have both parent walk you down the aisle and do not think of it as your father giving you away but your parents guiding you to a new life.

I'm just giving my opinion on the matter which is what she asked us to do.", "If YOUR WISHES are more important to you than less than five minutes of your life to make your dad extraordinarily happy, when I've given you a perfectly reasonable compromise to your stated reason for objecting to it, well, you do you sweetie.  It is, as you said, your wedding.", "It shouldn\u2019t, it just seems like a weird hill to fight on. If something so simple can make your father happy, why not?", "No offense but only a Christian or someone raised in some way in that faith would say Christmas as it currently exists isn't inherently Christian. It is and non Christians who DO celebrate other holidays feel that acutely every holiday season.", "Honestly do what you want but remeber. Actions have consequences. \nYou might find yourself having poorer relationship with your father after", "Just really, really selfish.", "I don\u2019t have a great relationship with my mother.", "He\u2019s been there for me. That doesn\u2019t mean I need to change who I am for him. As I said, part of being a parent is realizing your child is their own person with their own beliefs and morals. Good parents accept that.", "Gross.", "While I appreciate the *so subtle* attempt of trying to tell me I will feel bad about it when they\u2019re dead\u2026 I assure you I will not.", "She\u2019s inviting him and he\u2019s part of the wedding procession!", "Who said I am not inviting him to the wedding?", "No it\u2019s not. He\u2019ll get over it.", "You seem really offended that I didn\u2019t take your suggestion. It\u2019s just not for me, too much going on.", "How is it not like that? You are suggesting I put his wants over my own, are you not?", "He does not handle his emotions well in the moment but I am sure he will process it in his own time and be fine.", "Yes, that\u2019s what the entire post is about.", "Yes, my wishes at my wedding are more important than the wishes of other people whose wedding it isn\u2019t.", "Her wishes for *her wedding* should actually be more important in deciding how *her wedding* goes", "Because it would make me unhappy..?", "Why?", "Ah, sorry to hear that.", "Did you ask this question to actually get people\u2019s opinions or just to argue with them in place of your parents? If you don\u2019t want him to walk him you down the aisle - don\u2019t do it. But stop pretending like you care what he or anyone else thinks.", "It's your life, your decision", "Then why you are here if you have all the answers to everything? You don't want it and says your dad will suck it up and get over it then just do it your way, why lose time asking something if it's already decided how all of it will go?", "Yes I am! Because there are other options that could make both of you happy..unless you really just don't give a shit about your dads feelings.\n\n*\\*Food for thought tho...you could always let him walk you down the isle, give you a kiss on the cheek, shake your future husbands hand, and let him go sit down with your mom..\\*****you can totally skip the part where they say \"who gives this woman to this man\"...***", "Because you don\u2019t like the perception of the tradition or you simply don\u2019t like the idea of your dad walking with you on your wedding? \n\nIt\u2019s your wedding, you do what makes you happy.", "I didn\u2019t ask anywhere if I should go back on my decision. I am not changing my mind about it. I asked if I was wrong. The overwhelming response is that I am not.", "So again\u2026 putting what he wants above what I want.", "Because I don\u2019t like the meaning of the tradition and I don\u2019t want to be a participant in it.", "Then case closed, have the pat on your back that you want, enjoy the feeling and have a happy marriage", "I don\u2019t understand why you posted here. You\u2019ve obviously made up your mind on what\u2019s going to happen. \n\nWhat are you hoping to gain from posting here?", "And you won\u2019t, because it\u2019s your wedding.", "Thanks!", "I am pretty sure I posted here to ask \u201cAITA\u201d as the sub name says. Which I\u2019ve overwhelmingly gotten the \u201cno\u201d response.", "Okay then, YTA for your combative replies and snarky attitude.", "You\u2019re entitled to your opinion, but I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m expected to\u2026 not respond to people that I disagree with?"]}
