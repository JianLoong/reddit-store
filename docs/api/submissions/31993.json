But that\u2019s me, everyone sees the rituals through their own lens and you aren\u2019t wrong for wanting to feel your most comfortable best on your wedding day.", "NTA\n\nYou can do whatever you want BUT remember that every choice we make has consequences whether good or bad.  This one will, too.", "Nah I think it\u2019s understandable your dad is upset. Most people nowadays just see it as a cute moment for father and daughter not something offensive. It\u2019s your day though so it\u2019s up to you. Maybe you could have both parents walk with you?", "NAH. It's your wedding and you get to choose the events and customs you include, and as you note you aren't singling this one thing out or doing this in order to hurt his feeling. Meanwhile he isn't the AH for wanting to experience it, and quite possibly it's something he has thought about and looked forward to. \n\nJust one thought that might work as a compromise... Would you consider being walked down the aisle by perhaps both parents? It's not necessarily about being 'given away' - you could repurpose the ritual entirely to instead simply be two people who love and support you, being with you as you approach this major step, commitment, milestone. Perhaps then it would feel less paternalistic and possessive.", "NTA, but I\u2019ve seen more modern weddings where both parents walk the bride down the aisle.

Sometime people do things for other people even though they don't like doing it.", "NTA\n\nI, too, objected to women being treated as property during my wedding ceremony. I asked both of my parents to walk me down the aisle, and that's what we did. No giving anyone away, just a way to include them.\n\nThere are lots of things you could do involve your dad.

I understand that's how it originated, but I just assumed that we all agreed that it's now just a nice moment for a father and daughter to share on her big day. But TIL and to each their own.

Anyhow, NTA, its your wedding you should do what you want.", "YTA and good lord you sound insufferable as well.", "\n\nNAH - is the only response I feel right saying.  You have the right to do what you want on your wedding day, your right it's your day.\n\nDad has the right to be mad about it.", "You're NTA but despite that I'd seriously consider if this is a hill you want to die on. I'm close to your age and my parents are dead; if something like this meant something to them and I could give it to them I just would, it wouldn't be some huge sticking point to me personally. Yeah it is antiquated and kinda ridiculous, one could even say offensive in a certain light. But it's also in practice not what it used to symbolize, it's just a tradition and a way to show respect to your dad. No, you shouldn't have to show respect this way. But if I were you I'd spend some time thinking about how important this really is to you. It's literally 30 seconds and no one else will think anything of it, but it sounds like it might mean a lot to your dad.", "NTA BUUUUT you sure could be nicer. If it means a lot to someone I love, i think i can find it in my heart to give them this memory. Maybe compromise with two or three steps instead to make it bearable? \n\nAlso Dont think of it as giving you away.\nChange the symbolism... much like they guide you on your first steps as a kid, bring you to daycare and then school... this could be more like sending you off to the next chapter of your life.", "You are NTA for not wanting to feel like you are representing 'property'\n\nBut I do agree with the posters who have said that hopefully there's room for compromise. Maybe my story might give you something to think about.\n\nI was 45 years old when I got married, and one of my most cherished memories was being walked down the aisle by my very frail 82-year-old father who recently passed from dementia. My father-in-law missed the majority of the event driving my dad to and from so he could facilitate this happening. \n\nThere's no way in heck that I am property. I know that, everyone at the wedding knew that too. It was still a lovely way for me to honor my father.\n\nAll that said, at the end of the day it is your wedding and you do you. Perhaps ask your dad to have a special part of the ceremony like a reading or something in lieu of walking you down the aisle. That might be a way to make him feel special and still stand firm to your principles", "Why don\u2019t his parents, close friend, of relatives walk him down before you? The groom is always waiting, why not have him walked down too.\n\nI had some gay friends, and they had their parents and aunts and uncles walk both of them down.\n\nAllows you to honor your dad in a way that removes the negative tradition. You can even make your husband go last and you can wait for him.", "YWBTA if you refuse to let him do it imo\n\nI agree it's an outdated tradition but if it's important to your father you should just let him do it imo. You don't want to do it because you see it as your dad \"passing ownership\" of you to your husband. You *know* your dad doesn't \"own you\" and it sounds like your relationship with him is fairly healthy, so I assume he doesn't see you as property. He just wants to walk you down the aisle \"because that's what dad's do\". I think you're making too big of a deal out of it.\n\nIf it's really SUPER important to you to communicate to everyone at your wedding that you firmly believe that you are not \"property\", (so important that you are prioritizing communicating that over \"throwing your dad a bone\") I guess don't let your dad walk you down the aisle. If you care about your dad's feelings and want him to feel like he's part of your wedding then just let him do it. It's up to you to decide if \"making a statement\" is more important than avoiding family drama and hurt feelings.", "NTA. Could you maybe find something special for him to do at the wedding so he feels included? Or how would you feel if you stopped for a kiss on the cheek at the of the end aisle before taking your place up front? (Though I do see how that could also be interpreted as \"giving you away\")", "NTA \u2014 it\u2019s your wedding.", "YTA.  He's probably looked forward to doing this with you his whole life, and you are spitting his wish to be at your side on the most important day of your life back in his face.  This is a simple compromise.  Walk down the aisle with him, give him a kiss, join your fiance, and just tell your officiant to skip saying the \"who gives this woman\" crap, which, I do agree, is outdated and icky.  But you are making it a bigger deal than it is.", "NTA, weddings should be firmly about celebrating the marriage of two people, and people inserting themselves into it so they can do what they want/ feel is right is stupid. Op is already not doing things traditionally and her dad needs to get over himself. Also, not for nothing, they\u2019re getting married in a pizza place. There isn\u2019t going to be an aisle in the traditional sense.\n\nAll the YTAs in here are full of shit", "NTA but it doesn't have to mean that. A lot of people celebrate Christmas who don't believe in Christ - you're allowed to participate in a tradition without believing in the underlying dogma. So, it's totally your choice but it'll cost you nothing to give your dad an active role he otherwise won't have.", "I don't like wedding patriarchy - but my dad and mom both walked with me - so not so much giving away as being a part of it.\n\nI get it though and you are nTA", "NTA.", "Your wedding, your rules. NTA.", "NTA\n\nHowever The very act of a wedding service is draped in tradition and symbolism.  How about a compromise?  Have both parent walk you down the aisle and do not think of it as your father giving you away but your parents guiding you to a new life.

We even totally surprised my mother-in-law by surrounding her and doing a special honor dance for the mother of many who marries off her last child (my first husband was the final of six to marry). She was completely floored and SO excited and pleased. Nobody was pressuring us, though... in large part because my husband and I were more traditional than either of our families, and so neither set of parents even knew the traditions we were deciding whether or not to use. We pleased ourselves. \n\nIn my second wedding, my children walked me down the aisle. We got married in the front yard of our house; my one attendant rolled down the aisle in a powered wheelchair, and when my kids and I got up to the front, they stayed right there with us because we took vows to them immediately after taking vows to each other. It was important to us to cement the entire new family, not just our bond between the two of us, so each child received custom-written vows from my husband and I together. It was great. \n\nThere are tons of different ways you can make traditions your own or create new ones on the spot.

I can rest now, because I know they have a partner who will love them and cherish them just as much as I do.\"\n\n  \nPersonally I don't see why we limit it to daughters. I would be so exceedingly happy to do that for any of my kids, because like I said it's more like a happy moment that allows a parent to share their joy with the couple.

I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but for me personally it was more about my dad being there for me. I didn\u2019t want to walk down the aisle alone and I knew that if I tripped or stumbled my dad would save me. \n\nI also knew that my dad viewed it as an honor and was very proud to have that moment with me. My parents very much have \u201chippie\u201d mentalities and encouraged me to love dinosaurs and monster trucks as well as Barbies growing up. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a misogynistic thing to them because they raised me to be a strong and independent person who didn\u2019t need anyone to take care of me, but would support my choice in a life partner that would make me happy. \n\nSo it was just another way for my dad to support me.
