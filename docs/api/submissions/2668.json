Completely pleasant, a line a car-respondance if you will.", "Staple them to her front door.", "Don't be silly, her car is parked properly in her garage...", "That's interesting. Here in Germany anyone can put flyers etc in your mailbox. Pizza delivery is a common one.", "Is OP allowed to tape it onto the mailbox?", "Tell someone you don\u2019t live in England without saying those words haha The letter would be mush in minutes round here!!", "That's a really dumb take, only to show that none of those things are actually the neighbour's concern lol", "For they way op neighbor put the letter at night in a costume to not be recognized I don't think it will say anything nice, they are probably threats. I would open one to see what's inside and if is something to be scare of then ask to make a police report about it. This person doesn't seem to be very rational, and can be a danger if something ticks her off", "love this idiom. i\u2019m stealing it", "Without postage, that's a federal crime. Not worth the potential $5000 fine.", "I love you both! This conversation was amazing! 10 out of 10, love the level of petty snark. OP please do the return to sender thing!! \n\nPS if you have the info of the cops she called before I would call them and see what options you have. Since you have video harassment may be on the table", "Wait... So if I lived there and wanted to put say a get well soon card in the mailbox of someone with covid that would be a crime? Wtaf...", "NTA but watch your tyres.", "Personally I\u2019d wet the notes down and whip them at her place like giant spitballs. Your way is probably better, though. Def NTA.", "NTA of course. No explanation needed.\n\nCan you put it in her letterbox?", "NTA. Does your neighbor read every spam email they receive or answer every spam call? \n\nI'd only suggest recycling the notes as soon as you see them to, you know, um, save the environment. Or tearing them into small pieces to make mulch... Or use them to light cigarettes... I wouldn't want them defacing my car.", "NTA.  She\u2019s been told that there\u2019s nothing illegal about you parking your car on the street.  She shouldn\u2019t be wasting police time trying to enforce her personal preference that everyone park in a garage, nor should she be hassling you over it.", "NTA, good luck. I once offered to park a beater RV outside a similarly annoying person's home, they moved.\n\nYou sound like you are in the USA and yes the cops there are violent and dangerous, especially to PoC", "YTA - parking your car on the street when you own a garage is inconsiderate and annoying. Yes the street is public space, but people should take responsibility for their own belongings and park in their own driveway/garage. We live somewhere where people park on the street, and use their garage to fill with junk, and it\u2019s one of our biggest pet peeves.", "NTA. Maybe look into a restraining order.", "NTA. This woman needs a hobby.", "I was going to say you were nta until you made the statement about the cops", "NTA, and most people learn cops can be very dangerous the hard way. My friends mom still likes cops even after they arrested him in his front lawn after having his little brother call him otp to come home and kept coming to the house to arrest him when he already was in custody. Her reasoning is, her grandpa died in his apartment (didn't know, he just wasnt answering for a week) and the only way she could get inside is by calling the cops to break down the door. \n\nDoes she think they're dangerous? Her son literally had the jobs of dragging bodies that were shot and beat to a medic tent during some well known riots from cops killing someone where we live. \n\nSome people live in lala land", "I would stuff the unopened letters in her mailbox. NTA. Get a restraining order for harassment, show them the dash cam footage", "Do you have a community facebook page? A neighbour hood watch type thing? Upload the dashcam footage and ask who is this person?Then scan the note and say you're confused why this is an issue when its legal to park on the street. Just out her insanity. People will recognise her even with a mask.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m petty so I might consider leaving a note under my own windshield with a religious tract.", "OMG THIS WAS MY OLD LADY NEIGHBOR!!!\n\nYeah. The note says really mean stuff so I\u2019d ignore it too. Wish I had as when one got removed and I was parked \u201cwrong\u201d another appeared. \n\nGenius. I feel really dumb not thinking of it. Also been living here nearly 50 years. I\u2019m smacking my head. \n\nNTA", "Oh wow, so you are a woman and your neighbor didn't understand why you might be wary of the police?!? I (46f) have heard so many horror stories about officers taking advantage of the total power imbalance between their female prisoners and themselves, with little the women can do about it. Hell, I read somewhere that even Alfred Hitchcock feared the police more than anything else, bc of their ability to take away his freedom.", "I would take them an put them in her mailbox  with the note 'I think you misplaced this on my car' nta \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "As a UK citizen, that's incredible. Our letterboxes are on our front doors & the postman shoves junk mail through, regardless of whether we have actual mail. Imagine getting a criminal record for posting a note to your neighbour! Land of the Free, eh? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOp's NTA. Neighbour sounds a right busy body. A word of caution; I've seen neighbour disputes escalate into far more serious confrontations. With tragic consequences (neighbour's bf obtained a gun & shot dead her neighbour point blank). In London. Please take care; she could have more sinister motives", "Are you parking in front of your garage? Or are you blocking two spots by parking elsewhere? Is there a lack of parking places in your street? Conversely, are you the only person parking on the street? Are you blocking a driving lane?\n\nYou would still be NTA, this is just curiosity.", "Oh hell yes. Plaster it all over the neighborhood!", "Our government allowed Royal Mail to do a deal with the likes of Dominos & Pizza Hut & other companies to post their tat through our doors. We no longer have the choice about junk mail. A good reason my recycle bin is always full now.", "How often is mud an issue in your city that you have to actively think about preventing it from smearing if you have something attached to your wipers", "Print a screen grab of the security film showing it\u2019s her and put that under the wiper. Leave until she sees it.", "You are driving a several ton hunk of metal. You should 1000% be thinking of these things and avoiding any issues this simple to fix.", "They do if they're cops.", "Yep love it", "Damn, what a way to spend your cake day."]}
