Deliver the notes back to her house.", "You don't chose to be black and you are typically raised your religion.  Cops chose to be cops, some are good guys, but many are on power trips and some are flat out dangerous.  Cops have the power to ruin your life and get away with it, not wanting to mess with them is sensible.", ">Of course not all black people are violent, but it is a problem\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Treat people as people. Everyone deserves to be judged on their actions.\n\nIn generalizing black people as you have, what are you trying to acheive? Fighting lazy generalizations with even lazier ones? Good work.\n\nNot all cops are violent. But it is a problem. It is a problem that might make the risk-averse reluctant to have them involved.", "I almost said that, but then I figured if she's so adamant about OP parking in their garage then she probably parks in her garage. And we don't want OP arrested for trespassing lol", "Then she knows OP knows it's her.", "Im not sure what your point is. That the OP should welcome the presence of the police over something this trivial?\n\nYou dont seem to understand why some people might try to avoid being known to the police.\n\nYour bizarre conflation of generalizing about the police and racism fails to take into account that the problem many people have the police is the disproportionate amount of power they have. Black people do not and to suggest such a thing is as ignorant as it is offensive.\n\n\"Do cops kill more people then they should? Of course, any death that\u2019s not in an honest to god self defense situation is wrong, and cops should not get special protection\u2026 for every person killed they should be on trail just like you or me would, and evidence used to show if it was self defense or unnecessary force. Same trail, same punishment as everyone else.\"\n\nThats what should happen. It doesnt always, as you imply. Because of the amount of power they are granted.  \nYes, generalizing is bad. It is also a point so banal as to be not worth the trouble it took to type it.", "True, bad choice of wording. But my point of you should judge an entire group of people as dangerous because of the actions of a few remains the same.", "I don\u2019t make the association for individuals, as they should be treated. The associations I presented are from different media types and how differen groups are presented, either from encouraging it, or trying to do the right thing and discourage stereotyping through education. \n\nMy point was simply to show that generalizations of any group are dangerous and wrong. Treat people as individuals, not as groups.", "Ooooo fair point fair point. I'm sick and scrolling in a drug induced fog so the logic hamster is not on the wheel.", "She'd know if she put it in the mailbox too? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I agree that they have to much power, and am all for removing/reducing that, and treating them as you would any other person. \n\nMy point isn\u2019t specifically about the cops\u2026 it\u2019s my personal dislike towards at generalization of any group of people, based on the stereotype applied to them because of the actions of a minority of that group. \n\nIn this case, because of OPs comment, it happened to be about the police\u2026 but it could have just as easily been about any generalized group of people and I would have responded the same.", "We've all been there before! Feel better soon!", "Aww! Thanks!"]}
