If you\u2019re parking in a really inconvenient spot, it\u2019s only a matter of time before you get hit, and that would be at least half your fault for not even hearing the argument.", "NTA- she will get the point eventually that you don\u2019t give a damn about her letters. \n\nWhat you are an AH for is that last bit. Are there AH cops in the world? Yes\u2026 just like their are AH military members, politicians, CEOs, managers of target, etc\u2026 every groups has AHs\u2026. But that doesn\u2019t mean that EVERYONE of a certain profession is the same, as you lump them in to be. Yes, we have an epidemic of power hungry idiots who need sensitivity training or to be humiliated and fired so they can\u2019t even get a mall security job\u2026 but just because the media puts highest priority on sensationalizing it, doesn\u2019t mean that even a majority of police are dangerous\u2026 it\u2019s a minority that gets the majority of publicity.
