AJ says he wants to be part of the family again, but he also thinks he is the victim and is owed an apology. He also says that I need to be on his side, stand up for him, and get them all together in a room where they will talk things out. But I think he is the one who owes them an apology, and everything that has happened to him is his fault, even though he has faced some pretty serious consequences for his behavior. Those include:\n\n1. He worked with our father until summer 2022. Our dad (68M) says AJ was terminated for sexual harassment. AJ says this is bullshit and that actually he was unfairly fired for disagreeing with our dad at work. \n2. Our younger brother James (27M), who is in a relationship with a non-binary person, decided to go no-contact with AJ at the end of 2021 due to transphobic comments that AJ made in front of his partner. As a result, AJ was not included at Christmas 2022. \n\nLong version: I can\u2019t say what the reason is that he thinks he was fired for on here. But I think I can say that it was related to his views on an event that the whole world became VERY familiar with in 2020. I actually think that alone would have been a valid reason for terminating him because AJ and my dad are both pediatricians and it is related to his job because he was giving parents advice in line with an opinion not backed up by the scientific consensus in his field of work. \n\nBut he also asked out a receptionist who had to turn him down more than once, and that is the official reason given for his termination. There\u2019s no evidence that he said anything explicit or threatening to her, but come on dude - no means no. \n\nJames (younger brother) brought his new partner (who is non-binary) to Christmas 2021. AJ decided to bring up the JK Rowling controversy out of the blue, saying that he thinks she was right and that it\u2019s really unfair that she\u2019s getting backlash for just speaking the truth about trans people. Full disclosure I wasn\u2019t actually present for this conversation. Only James, AJ, and James\u2019s partner were in the room. That\u2019s James\u2019s side of the story. AJ\u2019s side of the story is that he just said he liked Harry Potter and James flipped out \u201clike a psycho\u201d. I don\u2019t think I believe that because AJ has said plenty more transphobic and homophobic things since then, although not to James because again - James has not spoken to him since then. \n\nGrowing up, we were extremely close. We are twins. I never wanted to lose the relationship with AJ. But now I think to do what he\u2019s asking me to do I would actually have to trick James into showing up and ambush him. Plus AJ expects me to stand up for him and be on his side and is super angry that I won\u2019t.", "created_utc": 1674763185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m0x35/aita_34f_for_not_backing_my_twin_brother_34m_in/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can love your brother and still hold him accountable for his assholish behavior. No one should ever expect someone to side with them when they know damn well that they are in the wrong. \n\nAJ is burning bridges and exploding relationships all over the place.

To quote one of life's greatest philosophers: \"Ain't nobody got time for that.\"", "NTA and frankly given you're his twin, if you can't get through to him, nobody can. I don't mean it's your responsibility, I mean that nobody likely currently has the level of close relationship that you have with him, so it may take you going \"No, you're being an ass\" to get through to him.    \n   \nOr you might not get through to him.

He needs to come back to reality and realize that his behavior (intended or not) has gotten him in trouble, not a series of unfortunate coincidences.\n\n>AJ says he wants to be part of the family again, but he also thinks he is the victim and is owed an apology\n\nIt just doesn't work that way. He's not taking ownership of his actions and behavior, and instead of any meaningful reflection or change on his part, he wants people to play into the fantasy that he's the ultimate victim. If you were to help him down this path, he would likely just find some other way to act out and get himself blacklisted by the rest of your family.\n\n>Plus AJ expects me to stand up for him and be on his side and is super angry that I won\u2019t.\n\nWhat your brother needs is someone to be real with him and call him on his behavior. Playing into his alternate reality won't help him. If he can't realize that he can't say and do whatever he wants without consequences, any \"second chance\" is going to be short lived.\n\nIf I were you, I'd shoot straight with your brother here. He needs honesty and directness, not fluff that plays into him false victimhood.

This is unacceptable behavior.  You can ask once, but then you never ask again.", "I mean I can't really think of a scenario where firing his son for sexual harassment saves face for your Dad. Seems more like your brother trying to deflect it and blame politics.\n\nAll I can say is that regardless to what side you take the relatives who can't stop arguing politics at gatherings are super obnoxious, so I think this sounds self-inflicted and NTA for declining to play peacemaker.", "There's no interpersonal conflict here, so this is likely to be taken down.\n\nAJ doesn't sound like the kind of person that can be reasoned with.

Your twin is absolutely not the victim here. Everyone around him is. I know you love him but his views and those like him are hurting a lot of people.

You don't need to back him up just because you're blood related. Let him clean up and deal with his own messes. He's an adult.", "NTA.  You can stay out of it, or you can tell AJ how you see things and help him improve his behaviour and make amends.  But you should not conspire to try and coerce your family to accept AJ's offensive behaviour.\n\nSeems like AJ is choosing to offend in ways that are calculated to most damage his family ties, and if so, he might need some counseling to try and figure out why he's sabotaging himself.", "NTA. Do what you know is right. Just because you are twins doesn't mean you must back him, even when he's wrong.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about. Because I think it\u2019s likely to get worse. I didn\u2019t include some things in this post because of the rules but basically AJ went down a far-right rabbit hole over 2020 and never said any of the shit he now says before that. I sort of feel responsible for it because I have an anxiety disorder and at the beginning of the pandemic it was really bad so AJ started trying to give me reassurance that the pandemic wouldn\u2019t be that bad. Eventually though, it ended up making me think he\u2019s not safe to be around because he wasn\u2019t taking it seriously and so I didn\u2019t visit for the holidays in 2020. We had a massive fight where he threatened to drive to my house (in another state like 8 hours away) and basically kidnap me and he started really kind of harassing me and yelling at me that I\u2019m crazy and my husband had to call him and tell him to back the fuck off and that he better not come here because we will not open the door and he will call police on him for trespassing if he has to. So. Part of me thinks he went down the far-right rabbit hole as an overreaction to my Covid anxiety and it led to exposure to other far right ideas.", "No it doesn\u2019t look great to admit that your son harassed someone, but not doing anything about it looks worse. Basically AJ thinks he was looking for a reason ever since they started fighting over the pandemic stuff. He said the woman told him she felt bad that he had to leave over it and she wasn\u2019t the one who brought it to my dad\u2019s attention, but gossip spreads in an office like that. Everyone knew about it by the time my dad found out and so he said that even if the woman said she was ok to still work with him, his hand was forced because it would affect the office environment to send a message that that\u2019s ok behavior and a lot of people might not feel comfortable working in a place where that\u2019s the case. So AJ\u2019s rants about it have been about how he was \u201ctreated like a r*pist\u201d over something that was \u201cinnocent.\u201d Which ties back to politics because it ties in to the far-right line about how you can\u2019t say anything to women these days etc. and that he didn\u2019t even say anything \u201caggressive\u201d to her. He\u2019s obviously not right cause it is inherently aggressive to ask someone out who works for you. Especially a second time after they said no. But the scary thing is no, I actually don\u2019t think he believes he did anything wrong in that scenario.", "This is going to sound like such a cliche but \u201che wasn\u2019t always like this.\u201d And I think I just want to hold onto how it used to be and it\u2019s depressing that I can\u2019t make it go back. I have had some struggles with anxiety and until 2020 he was really supportive. Our mom passed away when we were teenagers from a very rare form of cancer and after that I started having panic attacks, usually related to physical health symptoms. He was kind of the only person who knew what to say to calm me down. Until that didn\u2019t really work anymore in 2020 during the pandemic because he just started kinda denying it and that actually made me feel unsafe. I responded to another comment with the details of that. But. Yeah for a long time we were really close.", "Yes, codependence has been a problem throughout. We went to the same college but then he got into a great medical school. I applied for law school at the same school but was not accepted there. I met my husband in school and we got married and ended up staying in the city where we attended school. That cured a lot of the codependency but clearly there is still some.", ">Part of me thinks he went down the far-right rabbit hole as an overreaction to my Covid anxiety and it led to exposure to other far right ideas.\n\nEven if this is the case, please know that it isn't your fault. AJ made choices that led him to this point, and that's on him.", "Oh no, OP.  You did not cause this.  He's a grown man.  An adult by any standard.  He made the decision to dive down the right-wing rabbit hole.  You didn't hold a gun to his head and drag him there.\n\nSeriously OP - YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE for your twin's beliefs or actions.

I'm sorry that's happened to you.\n\nUnfortunately there's only so much you can do about it - express your boundaries and what behavior your find unacceptable clearly, the rest is up to him.", "Thanks. Since you were willing to help me you can DM me about your family issue too if you need someone to talk to.", "NTA. AJ is a bigot and seemingly antivax. Sounds like he went down some rabbit holes that your family is not happy with. Also, he is using your dads company as his dating pool, exposing dad to legal liabilit. You should have a heartfelt conversation with AJ and let him know that you love him, but he owes the others an apology. If he wants to take that out of you, you will go NC with him too.", "I think you need to keep your distance from Aj, as what you've written here about his behaviour is frankly scary. So many people have gone down that rabbit hole and few have returned as better people. I'm sorry."]}
