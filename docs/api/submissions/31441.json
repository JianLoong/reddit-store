My friends Ashley, Sandra, and Kate (all 28F, too) are my bridesmaids. Last summer, I got them together over drinks and made cute bridesmaid-posal gifts, and they all happily agreed to stand with us on our big day. Ashley was my neighbor growing up, and I went to college with Sandra and Kate. Needless to say, we are very close and can tell each other anything.\n\nNow, Kate has always hated long skirts and dresses. She\u2019ll wear them occasionally for events, but she feels her legs are her best feature and often goes for skinny jeans. She\u2019s very into her appearance, but not in a vain way, I think it actually comes from insecurity and being bullied in middle school. We are having a church wedding, so I picked bridesmaid dresses that are long and have cap sleeves. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, Kate called me and said she couldn\u2019t be a BM anymore. I asked her why, and she said she had actually realized she was a transman and didn\u2019t want to present as a woman at the wedding. I told her that was totally fine and I\u2019d still love to have her as a bridesman in a color-coordinated suit. She cried and thanked me. I asked if she wanted me to use a different name and/ or pronouns, but she said no. She asked me to keep it quiet, as she won\u2019t come out until after the holidays.\n\nWell, just yesterday I got a call from my cousin Missy (37F), who is my matron of honor. She is in a weight loss group with Kate, apparently, but she never put two and two together that Kate was \u201cKate, Lemon\u2019s bestie from college.\u201d Two days ago, the group had a meeting and got on the topic of body image. People were talking about how to navigate situations that bring up body image issues. Kate shared that she feels she \u201clooks like a 600 pound life cast member\u201d in a dress, and she even tricked her best friend into letting her wear a pants suit in her wedding. Kate mentioned something about the reception venue (very unique), and it was enough for Missy to get suspicious and put the pieces together.\n\nI haven\u2019t confronted Kate yet, but I\u2019m absolutely fuming, and I think I want to kick her out of the wedding. But I was talking the situation over with my sister yesterday, and she said Kate might really be doubting her gender and I should be supportive. The thing is, Kate could\u2019ve just told me she\u2019d feel too body conscious in a dress, and I would have let her wear a pants suit no problem. She didn\u2019t need to manipulate me into it. It\u2019s the lying that hurts me and makes me want to kick Kate to the curb.\n\nAITA/ WIBTA if I removed Kate from my wedding party?", "created_utc": 1700592076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180o17m/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 1662, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am a Trans Man and I always hated dresses/skirts/makeup/a whole bunch of other things growing up. Ever since I came out, I am very much anti anything that would make me feel the wrong gender. To me, pant suits are very feminine. Feminine presenting people prefer pant suits when possible and masculine presenting people prefer 3 piece suits. \n\nI find the whole situation with your friend extremely odd. Why would your friend say \"Hey I'm trans and this\" to you but then do what this friend did to a different group of people? I say have a very solid and very lengthy discussion with your friend. \n\nHowever, I will say NTA. That's simply because you don't want someone in your wedding party or on your special day that would make you feel negative emotions but that's also jus my opinion.

Gently...\n\nBody dysmorphia is body dysmorphia, regardless of if it's gender-based or based on something else. She's obviously feeling extremely uncomfortable in her own skin, and that feeling can be intolerable. It sucks that she felt ok with lying (if it even was a lie, who knows), but maybe she panicked and felt so much anxiety, she felt it was the only choice. It is true that many people understand the severity of body dysmorphia if it\u2019s gender related, but they don\u2019t really get how severe it is when it\u2019s gender congruent. So, I can see why she felt like lying would get her point across better, and I don't think she was trying to \"play you for a fool,\" I think she was just feeling really insecure.\n\nDoes it really make that big of a difference if she wears a suit, for whatever reason? Would you rather she be uncomfortable and anxious?\n\nI think Missy is \"TA\" here, for stirring the pot right before your wedding and disclosing something that was said in a private therapy group. Those groups are supposed to be completely confidential. Kate clearly needs the therapy badly, and now she won't feel comfortable getting help there anymore, so Missy's actions were really counterproductive. She should have stayed out of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit-\n\nI think you should message Missy:\n\n\"Hey, I really appreciate you reaching out in concern about Kate. However, I've decided that it is clear she is dealing with a ton of body image issues, and it doesn't matter to me if they are rooted in gender dysphoria or general body dysmorphia.

I know she isn't a liar outside of this context, she is probably just feeling really insecure and it's messing with her head. I think it's best if we don't confront her about this, I want her to continue feeling comfortable getting support in your group.\"", "I\u2019m probably the minority but I would be more upset my friend lied to me than just being honest with me.

They're uncomfortable for me, and I usually look either pregnant or like an overstuffed sausage.

We certainly don't. \n\nIf she is really your friend you shouldn't jump to conclusions, I'm inclined to think she wasn't intentionally tricking or manipulating you but rather it is a symptom of her struggles with her body image and/or transitioning. It would be incredibly outrageous for someone to lie about that just to wear a different outfit for one occasion...so unless you think she is capable of that then you shouldn't draw that conclusion yet.

Everyone is hyper focusing on the word \"tricked\" when it's been filtered through multiple layers at this point!", "The fact that you listed all the abuse your friend has gone through but still can\u2019t understand why OP\u2019s friend would want to test the waters by making up a story about lying about being trans before revealing himself is appalling", "But WHY? If she truly is trans, then why would she even need to bring up the story unless she was proud of her trickery?", "Why would she need a cover story? Plenty of women wear suits to weddings these days.", "I think that\u2019s absolutely plausible, but please do not misgender him", "Fuck this was deep. Great points!", "I agree. She has to talk to Kate before anything else.", "You literally have a reply in this thread saying that because pants suits are feminine to you, you think Kate lied to OP and isn't a trans man. I'm telling you that at least one trans man--me!--is fine with wearing a pants suit. You don't need to be telling cis people how to gender-detect real trans from fake ones. They're already too eager to do that. \n\nI find it astonishing that you have not even considered that Missy might be transphobic and trying to hurt Kate. Surely you're aware of that possibility?", "The point is, we don't know if *Missy* is telling the truth about Kate.", "Missed that, thank you for correcting me. Whether its true or not I never wanna mis-pronoun someone.", "YES. Thank you. It's so very very very unlikely that a cis person would lie about being trans. It's very very very *likely* that a cis person might misunderstand, or be a TERF/transphobe, or any number of other mistakes.", "This!!!!", "Just because Kate said she tricked someone doesn't mean she said how she did.", "The fact that she was callously lying and admitting she \u201ctricked\u201d  OP, speaks volumes. It\u2019s not something one who is trans would lie about, as it could be terrifying and not something someone who is trans would life about", "I agree..OP is NTA but Kate is. The comment about tricking her is the giveaway.", "Yeah, sh used that wording because she's proud of her deception, pretty fucked", "Because he would like to come out to the group but is afraid they will be hateful and unaccepting.  Telling them he lied about it let\u2019s him see how they react and how they feel about trans people without exposing himself.  As someone who is agender but isn\u2019t out in real life except to a small handful of people, I have no problem understanding why he would do this.", "Because she's proud of her deception \ud83e\udd2e", "It's a weight loss group, not a support group. I'm thinking WeightWatchers etc. Those groups gossip like the dickens and people horrendously over-share every week.", "Yes, Missy has SERIOUSLY overstepped here.  She should not be allowed in the group.", "That\u2019s true, but why did you jump straight to suggesting OP was treating her friend as a prop instead of a person?", "True, although one point in Missy's favor is that she shouldn't know why OP agreed to let Kate wear a pantsuit.\n\nPersonally I'd just assume that Kate asked and OP said yes. I  wouldn't think it was because Kate told OP something that could potentially be a lie.", "But this isn't testing any waters. Its just her telling how she tricked her friend because she doesn't like how she looks in a dress. And if she were a trans man, but not out, not having to wear dresses would be easy.", "No serious person would look at a women in a pants suit and think \u201cOMG they\u2019re trans!\u201d \n\nI might understand that \u2018testing the waters\u2019 attitude with a coworker, not a group of best friends from college. It\u2019s deceptive, with a group of people you should be able to communicate honestly with.", "I'm not r/blueavole. I never said such a thing.", "People on Reddit love arguing why the obvious thing that obviously happened might not have happened. \n\nIt\u2019s clear to everyone with a brain what the logical conclusion is, and there\u2019s a reason why \u201cthink horses not zebras when you hear hooves\u201d is an expression, but Reddit loves zebras.", "It absolutely is testing the waters.  By saying he lied about being trans, he can see how the rest of the group feels about trans people before coming out to them.  It\u2019s a safe way to find out if they will be accepting or abusive if he does come out.", "Sorry I really think this is a testing the waters situation.", "Oh, sorry. Why did you respond to my response to them then?", ">It\u2019s clear to everyone with a brain what the logical conclusion is, and there\u2019s a reason why \u201cthink horses not zebras when you hear hooves\u201d is an expression, but Reddit loves zebras.\n\n\nWell duh have you ever tried to shoe a zebra? It\u2019s impossible!\u2026/s if not obvious", "To be fair, most of the posts on this sub are the equivalent  of \"My friend and I heard hooves. I think it is horses. My friend thinks it is zebras. Am I wrong?\" A single comment saying\"of course it is fucking horses\" would get old. So instead reddit goes \"well maybe they are in Africa or at a zoo.\"", "First of all, its she, as OP said she didn't want to change pronoun use.\n\nSecond, she only told OP she was trans, nobody else. So what group are you taking about?", "You realize some people hate this emotional psychological BS, could careless if you are trans.  Like this testing the waters thing would infuriate me more then anyone else.  My ADHD ass would be like just tell them you hate dresses and they make you feel fat.", "Uhhh...  that is such a stretch.  If i wanted people to have a good opinion of trans folks while I feel them out  I would not start out by portraying myself as a deception and certainly not one I can discard easily when convenient or if the audience want receptive.  That would be the opposite of what Is do and the most common way folks explore trans is through dressing non confirming while pointing out how it made me happy and maybe shifting pronouns along the agab -> gnc -> enby -> real gender pipeline.", "Because I'm honestly alarmed how many people are taking as gospel that Kate lied when *OP doesn't know that*. Missy could be mistaken. Missy could be lying to cause drama. There's a million other possibilities here, but you and others are 100% sold that Kate must be lying. Why??", "\"*She is in a weight loss group with Kate, apparently, but she never put two and two together that Kate was \u201cKate, Lemon\u2019s bestie from college.\u201d Two days ago, the group had a meeting and got on the topic of body image*. People were talking about how to navigate situations that bring up body image issues. Kate shared that she feels she \u201clooks like a 600 pound life cast member\u201d in a dress, and she even tricked her best friend\"\n\n\n^ that group, that she thought was totally unconnected to the op", "Where do you get 100% sold from when I used the caveat \u201cseemingly\u201d? I agree that OP should talk to Kate before taking Missy\u2019s word for what happened, but my main point was that at no point did OP treat her friends as props.", "Ok, but how would she be able to test the waters with that group considering she never tells them she is trans?", "Well y\u2019all should possibly reconsider this phrase as a culture\u2026and I say that as an American, there\u2019s no effing excuse for us EVER really"]}
