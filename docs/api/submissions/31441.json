My friends Ashley, Sandra, and Kate (all 28F, too) are my bridesmaids. Last summer, I got them together over drinks and made cute bridesmaid-posal gifts, and they all happily agreed to stand with us on our big day. Ashley was my neighbor growing up, and I went to college with Sandra and Kate. Needless to say, we are very close and can tell each other anything.\n\nNow, Kate has always hated long skirts and dresses. She\u2019ll wear them occasionally for events, but she feels her legs are her best feature and often goes for skinny jeans. She\u2019s very into her appearance, but not in a vain way, I think it actually comes from insecurity and being bullied in middle school. We are having a church wedding, so I picked bridesmaid dresses that are long and have cap sleeves. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, Kate called me and said she couldn\u2019t be a BM anymore. I asked her why, and she said she had actually realized she was a transman and didn\u2019t want to present as a woman at the wedding. I told her that was totally fine and I\u2019d still love to have her as a bridesman in a color-coordinated suit. She cried and thanked me. I asked if she wanted me to use a different name and/ or pronouns, but she said no. She asked me to keep it quiet, as she won\u2019t come out until after the holidays.\n\nWell, just yesterday I got a call from my cousin Missy (37F), who is my matron of honor. She is in a weight loss group with Kate, apparently, but she never put two and two together that Kate was \u201cKate, Lemon\u2019s bestie from college.\u201d Two days ago, the group had a meeting and got on the topic of body image. People were talking about how to navigate situations that bring up body image issues. Kate shared that she feels she \u201clooks like a 600 pound life cast member\u201d in a dress, and she even tricked her best friend into letting her wear a pants suit in her wedding. Kate mentioned something about the reception venue (very unique), and it was enough for Missy to get suspicious and put the pieces together.\n\nI haven\u2019t confronted Kate yet, but I\u2019m absolutely fuming, and I think I want to kick her out of the wedding. But I was talking the situation over with my sister yesterday, and she said Kate might really be doubting her gender and I should be supportive. The thing is, Kate could\u2019ve just told me she\u2019d feel too body conscious in a dress, and I would have let her wear a pants suit no problem. She didn\u2019t need to manipulate me into it. It\u2019s the lying that hurts me and makes me want to kick Kate to the curb.\n\nAITA/ WIBTA if I removed Kate from my wedding party?", "created_utc": 1700592076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/180o17m/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_wedding/", "score": 799, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am a Trans Man and I always hated dresses/skirts/makeup/a whole bunch of other things growing up. Ever since I came out, I am very much anti anything that would make me feel the wrong gender. To me, pant suits are very feminine. Feminine presenting people prefer pant suits when possible and masculine presenting people prefer 3 piece suits. \n\nI find the whole situation with your friend extremely odd. Why would your friend say \"Hey I'm trans and this\" to you but then do what this friend did to a different group of people? I say have a very solid and very lengthy discussion with your friend. \n\nHowever, I will say NTA. That's simply because you don't want someone in your wedding party or on your special day that would make you feel negative emotions but that's also jus my opinion.

Gently...\n\nBody dysmorphia is body dysmorphia, regardless of if it's gender-based or based on something else. She's obviously feeling extremely uncomfortable in her own skin, and that feeling can be intolerable. It sucks that she felt ok with lying (if it even was a lie, who knows), but maybe she panicked and felt so much anxiety, she felt it was the only choice. It is true that most people understand the severity of body dysmorphia if it\u2019s gender related, but they don\u2019t really get how severe it is when it\u2019s gender congruent. Does it really make that big of a difference if she wears a suit, for whatever reason? Would you rather she be uncomfortable and anxious?\n\nI think Missy is in the wrong here, for stirring the pot right before your wedding and disclosing something that was said in a private therapy group.

We certainly don't. \n\nIf she is really your friend you shouldn't jump to conclusions, I'm inclined to think she wasn't intentionally tricking or manipulating you but rather it is a symptom of her struggles with her body image and/or transitioning.

If it came down to it, would Kate not wearing a dress be a show stopper to you? You aren't evil if it is (I would be hurt that Kate would be okay doing so for other things, but not my wedding!

She may have felt more comfortable sharing her insecurities in that setting than with you. And if she is so deeply unhappy with herself and insecure that she felt like her best or only option to avoid wearing a dress in front of everyone at a wedding was to say that she\u2019s a trans man, I\u2019m hard-pressed to call her an AH for that, even though lying about being trans is beyond shitty.

It is very, very common for trans folk to lie about their gender, make up stories, to even make ourselves into the bad guy, all to cover up for the utter confusion that surrounds our gender.
