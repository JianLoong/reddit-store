You'd have to be the one who judges the situation and loss vs gain, but you might have enough rope to preemptively nip this on the bud. \n\nIt would be the truth to say that you made out with the girl when you were extremely drunk, vulnerable, and had poor judgement. Your gender identity shouldn't matter because your friend took advantage of the first time you were drunk around them and took an incriminating video. It being the first time you were drunk around them is the big thing. It has no pattern of behavior to attach to it. \n\nAgain, you'd have to weigh loss vs gain. But, could you preemptively bring this up to anyone at your workplace because your friend has shown that they might use it against you? You'd simply state the facts of the situation.

Maybe you do not, and it is all projected onto you by this friend because they have issues. All I'm saying is that this friend certainly feels that way, deep down. And this video is their validation for all their negative feelings they have been burying deep inside.\n\nIf you look back at past conversations through the lense of what I just discussed, I would be shocked to find out there have been no snide comments, *jokes*, looks or them preferring to be seen as \"less than perfect\" by friends other than you so they wouldn't feel judged. \n\nIn short, this person is not your friend as it stands. Doesn't mean you can't salvage a friendship with some hard conversations, lots of communication, and openness from both parties. But judging by their response, I'm not sure they are ready to face the truth of why they want that video.\n\nPerhaps peer pressure can help if that's the case?
