But is your \"friend\" aware of the potential legal issues?", "I'm terribly sorry, but I don't think she intends to fully get rid of it.

She has no reason to record in the first place, and most certainly has no reason to keep the recording.", "NTA, she should delete it, and if she won't, she's not your friend. But once you sort that out ... if you're determined to stay in the closet, you can't get drunk and make out with girls in public.

Besides that\u2026 she can\u2019t record you or have videos of you making out with anyone, without your personal consent. Besides that, you should consider making out with people in private if you don\u2019t want your life being exposed. People nowadays love to pull out their phones and record just for the plot.

A real friend would never say that and would delete the video at your request.\n\nThis is the kind of thing that will be believed by whomever talks about it first. A stupid person might say that you should be able to be public about your sexuality and you shouldn't work for a company like that in the first place- but that doesn't matter because outing someone without permission is universally bad. You'd have to be the one who judges the situation and loss vs gain, but you might have enough rope to preemptively nip this on the bud. \n\nIt would be the truth to say that you made out with the girl when you were extremely drunk, vulnerable, and had poor judgement. Your gender identity shouldn't matter because your friend took advantage of the first time you were drunk around them and took an incriminating video. It being the first time you were drunk around them is the big thing. It has no pattern of behavior to attach to it. \n\nAgain, you'd have to weigh loss vs gain. But, could you preemptively bring this up to anyone at your workplace because your friend has shown that they might use it against you? You'd simply state the facts of the situation. You were drunk around your friends for the first time. You were vulnerable and taken advantage of. Kissing another girl shouldn't matter because you were drunk.

Her response sucks as well, and she sounds like a generally shitty person. \n\nHowever, you chose to get sloppy drunk. I get it, no judgement, been there many times. But if your private life is that important to you, don\u2019t have queer makeouts in front of people. Anyone could have filmed it, or someone at the party could know your boss. You can\u2019t expect your friends to be strict about your privacy if you aren\u2019t yourself. I do get that accidents happen, and of anyone your friend should be understanding of that!

Good Luck.", "YTA, you have no right to privacy in a public space, when others are present. Doesn't matter if it's a friends house, you still have no right to privacy.

Some people do them when they're drunk, with consent AND asked/them knowing they're filmed. Even then,  a polite filmer asks, whether one should delete the content first thing in the morning, when the one being filmed is sober again. \n\nShe hoarding it is quite weird if you ask me.
