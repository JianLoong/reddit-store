{"id": 5729, "submission_id": "zw1fex", "title": "Update: My brother tricked his wife into naming their kids after Robins.", "selftext": "I told Mikey and his wife that I posted on Reddit. Mikey was confused that I figured out what he was doing, because he knows I have no interest in comics. So, I sent both of them the post. Mikey was really embarrassed when he read what many of you said.\n\nMikey is playful and loves his kids more than anything. Our family has always been one to tolerate small short-term white lies for the sake of harmless pranks. However, Mikey's lie wasn't small, short-term or harmless. He hurt his wife's feelings deeply.\n\nMikey says (and SIL confirmed) that he was never insistent about naming my oldest nephew Richard. There were other names he suggested, but she liked Richard, so they picked it. Mikey spends a lot of time with Ricky. He often takes him to job sites and lets Ricky pretend to be his assistant. He has this playful thing with Ricky that he's Mikey's \"sidekick\" and they're a team. It's sweet.\n\nHere endeth the sweetness. When my SIL was pregnant again, Mikey wanted to replicate the Robin thing. He wanted to name this son after the next Robin, Jason. My SIL wasn't as big a fan of that name, but she also didn't have a name she loved. Mikey was very persistent about the name, so she decided it was fine. He never told her why he wanted that name, just said he really liked it.\n\nMy SIL said to him, and to me as well, she doesn't have a problem with the fact that he got the name from a comic book. She gets what the meaning is to him, even though she doesn't like comics, and she does think it's cute. Her issue is that he lied by omission. Even though she wouldn't have cared about the name, he lied just in case she might have, and if it had been something she wouldn't have approved of, she would want to have been able to say no. However, even this she would have not been too mad about. The lie of omission became an active lie when he made up a family member to convince her of the name of the next Robin, Stephanie, when there was a girl name she loved, Chloe. That's not a small lie for a cute prank.\n\nEven though Mikey was defensive initially, after they had a private conversation this morning, he realized how wrong he was and apologized. My SIL said he was very sincere, and Mikey has never been good at faking sincerity. He feels very bad for taking advantage of her trust. He feels even worse that it involved their children.\n\nThis whole thing has soured my SIL on the name Chloe. Now it only reminds her of the fight and hurt. She wants to come up with a completely new name, maybe one related to her hobby, like Mallory or Rita. She's going to take some time to not think about it. Their marriage isn't in danger, but a wound is there. Now that Mikey has admitted fault, it can heal, and it will with time.\n\nIf you learn anything from Mikey, learn that everyone makes mistakes. If someone truly loves you, they can usually forgive you. However, to earn that forgiveness you have to admit to what you did, not double down and try to trick your way out of it.", "created_utc": 1672100497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw1fex/update_my_brother_tricked_his_wife_into_naming/", "score": 547, "replies": ["[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuh0c0/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_no_one_in_our_family/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "This is all your SIL's FIL fault for his love of life.", "Are you talking about my dad?", "Oh my god I can\u2019t believe this website is free", "Yeah this one's going in the BORU Hall of Fame", "Wow!

That was a betrayal - a years long lie. I hope your SIL allows herself to fully process how she feels, allows herself to be mad if she needs to be, and that Mikey steps up to actually atone for what he did.

Like Cassandra or Barbara!", "It was a super good read!", "What about little Eddie-Munson?", "In most areas he is very selfless. I had to cut a lot out of my original draft of the update to stay under 3k characters. I wanted to say more about my brother's personality. He is an amazing father and loving husband. When my SIL got invited on a trip she really wanted to do when Ricky was eight months old my brother made sure there was nothing to impede her trip. He took care of everything, and she came home to a spotless house.\n\nThe thing about Mikey is that he is impulsive. On a less charitable day I might even call him childish. He's also one of those people that rarely sees anything as a big deal. In his mind this was a cute and harmless prank. Only after our mom and his wife separately explained to him just how messed up it was did he get it.\n\nMy SIL told me when we were texting she had to use this example: \"Imagine you wanted me to try a food, but you weren't 100% I would agree. So you didn't tell me what it was. Then I tried it and asked you specifically what it was and you lied.\" He was horrified by that scenario and that's when it started to click.", "My SIL was only not talking to me that day because she was upset with my brother and confused about why he would lie, but she didn't want to start something in front of the kids or my parents, so she was trying to just say as little as possible and think about everything. She was never angry with me.\n\nMy brother did apologize to me. It was a brief almost offhand apology, but that's okay. Right now he is focusing on his wife, as he should. I might get a \"real\" apology at a later date, or I might not. It isn't really about me.", "He is very embarrassed about that now. Our mom said something to him about how grandma would be very disappointed that he made up a lie like that about her family. He was so close with grandma and I think he is ashamed now.", "He has completely accepted that.

I think those are the last names of famous climbers.", "Mountain climbing and hiking are her passion. I think those are last names of guys who broke some climbing record or something.", "No, Chloe is the name she has always wanted for a girl. It does suck that this ruined the name for her. There's a possibility that by the time the baby is here the name will have lost the negative association for her. Only time will tell.", "She doesn't think it's small, but they love each other. They promised for better or worse and right now it's worse. She's hurt. She feels like he took advantage of her unconditional trust in him that caused her not to question when he spun a yarn for her. All the same, he has admitted that he is in the wrong, apologized, and agreed that whatever name makes her feel better about this will be the name regardless of his preference. Healing from this will take time, but she is willing to put in the effort to forgive and he is willing to put in the effort to work for that forgiveness.", "Commentors on the last post already warned me about those names.", "lmao", "Are you having a stroke?", "I remember that! Poor little girl", "I saw that on tiktok that poor poor child is going to loath her mother", "Idk OP-- for him to think of the name thing as a PRANK is far worse that the food anecdote your SIL gave him.

Then, more egregiously, he double downed on it. Never do that. He should have known better. The first time, with Jason, when it was just a \"didn't tell the truth\" lie, that could have quickly been forgiven. The lie he fabricated to cover up the first omission is so much worse by multiple orders of magnitude.\n\nI love my brother, but this might be the stupidest decision he ever made.", "I was so confused.

He only said \u201cwell I was going to tell her when we were done having kids!\u201d because he got caught and had to admit it. \n\nI doubt he was really going to tell her after they were done having kids. No he was going to wait until someone else picked up on it.

I thought the emphasis was on the taking care of an eight month old by themself so the other partner could get away. Which for me is a very nice thing to do for someone from either end of the gender/parental role. As imo both parents should be equally picking up responsibility when they're that young and a handful, so one giving the other a break is nice enough to stand out from my perspective. I read the place being clean as an afterthought, as like I said I don't expect the place to be spotless just intact upon return. cleaning and chores and life is hard enough just by myself, can't imagine having to take care of a kid and keep it spotless too. Also I think we expect the homemaker to keep things clean and take care of the kid regardless of gender as that's part of the job they usually agree to. If my partner is working and Im stay at home parenting Im gonna assume im doing a greater portion of the cooking and cleaning, as the workweek is designed with the idea of a homemaker in mind (which for the record I think is bullshit and Im against if they want raise wages to make that possible). So then having all those responsibilities given to one person when the other one leaves, to me, is a point where honestly I wouldn't expect the Homemaker to keep everything spotless. So imo regardless of gender they should get some kudos for that now that I think it through.", "Lol! So I just looked it up and she is Damian's mother? That is pretty funny because one of the comments in the original post was \"at least he didn't suggest Damian\". So I really hit a home run there.", "Eh, I said it more as the context of naming a child after a fictional character in general while actively keeping the name origin/inspiration a secret from the other parent/spouse lol"]}
