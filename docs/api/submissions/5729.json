Mikey was confused that I figured out what he was doing, because he knows I have no interest in comics. So, I sent both of them the post. Mikey was really embarrassed when he read what many of you said.\n\nMikey is playful and loves his kids more than anything. Our family has always been one to tolerate small short-term white lies for the sake of harmless pranks. However, Mikey's lie wasn't small, short-term or harmless. He hurt his wife's feelings deeply.\n\nMikey says (and SIL confirmed) that he was never insistent about naming my oldest nephew Richard. There were other names he suggested, but she liked Richard, so they picked it. Mikey spends a lot of time with Ricky. He often takes him to job sites and lets Ricky pretend to be his assistant. He has this playful thing with Ricky that he's Mikey's \"sidekick\" and they're a team. It's sweet.\n\nHere endeth the sweetness. When my SIL was pregnant again, Mikey wanted to replicate the Robin thing. He wanted to name this son after the next Robin, Jason. My SIL wasn't as big a fan of that name, but she also didn't have a name she loved. Mikey was very persistent about the name, so she decided it was fine. He never told her why he wanted that name, just said he really liked it.\n\nMy SIL said to him, and to me as well, she doesn't have a problem with the fact that he got the name from a comic book. She gets what the meaning is to him, even though she doesn't like comics, and she does think it's cute. Her issue is that he lied by omission. Even though she wouldn't have cared about the name, he lied just in case she might have, and if it had been something she wouldn't have approved of, she would want to have been able to say no. However, even this she would have not been too mad about. The lie of omission became an active lie when he made up a family member to convince her of the name of the next Robin, Stephanie, when there was a girl name she loved, Chloe. That's not a small lie for a cute prank.\n\nEven though Mikey was defensive initially, after they had a private conversation this morning, he realized how wrong he was and apologized. My SIL said he was very sincere, and Mikey has never been good at faking sincerity. He feels very bad for taking advantage of her trust. He feels even worse that it involved their children.\n\nThis whole thing has soured my SIL on the name Chloe. Now it only reminds her of the fight and hurt. She wants to come up with a completely new name, maybe one related to her hobby, like Mallory or Rita. She's going to take some time to not think about it. Their marriage isn't in danger, but a wound is there. Now that Mikey has admitted fault, it can heal, and it will with time.\n\nIf you learn anything from Mikey, learn that everyone makes mistakes. If someone truly loves you, they can usually forgive you. However, to earn that forgiveness you have to admit to what you did, not double down and try to trick your way out of it.", "created_utc": 1672100497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw1fex/update_my_brother_tricked_his_wife_into_naming/", "score": 33, "replies": ["[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuh0c0/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_no_one_in_our_family/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "This is all your SIL's FIL fault for his life of life.", "Are you talking about my dad?"]}
