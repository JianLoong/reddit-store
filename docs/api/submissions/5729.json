{"id": 5729, "submission_id": "zw1fex", "title": "Update: My brother tricked his wife into naming their kids after Robins.", "selftext": "I told Mikey and his wife that I posted on Reddit. Mikey was confused that I figured out what he was doing, because he knows I have no interest in comics. So, I sent both of them the post. Mikey was really embarrassed when he read what many of you said.\n\nMikey is playful and loves his kids more than anything. Our family has always been one to tolerate small short-term white lies for the sake of harmless pranks. However, Mikey's lie wasn't small, short-term or harmless. He hurt his wife's feelings deeply.\n\nMikey says (and SIL confirmed) that he was never insistent about naming my oldest nephew Richard. There were other names he suggested, but she liked Richard, so they picked it. Mikey spends a lot of time with Ricky. He often takes him to job sites and lets Ricky pretend to be his assistant. He has this playful thing with Ricky that he's Mikey's \"sidekick\" and they're a team. It's sweet.\n\nHere endeth the sweetness. When my SIL was pregnant again, Mikey wanted to replicate the Robin thing. He wanted to name this son after the next Robin, Jason. My SIL wasn't as big a fan of that name, but she also didn't have a name she loved. Mikey was very persistent about the name, so she decided it was fine. He never told her why he wanted that name, just said he really liked it.\n\nMy SIL said to him, and to me as well, she doesn't have a problem with the fact that he got the name from a comic book. She gets what the meaning is to him, even though she doesn't like comics, and she does think it's cute. Her issue is that he lied by omission. Even though she wouldn't have cared about the name, he lied just in case she might have, and if it had been something she wouldn't have approved of, she would want to have been able to say no. However, even this she would have not been too mad about. The lie of omission became an active lie when he made up a family member to convince her of the name of the next Robin, Stephanie, when there was a girl name she loved, Chloe. That's not a small lie for a cute prank.\n\nEven though Mikey was defensive initially, after they had a private conversation this morning, he realized how wrong he was and apologized. My SIL said he was very sincere, and Mikey has never been good at faking sincerity. He feels very bad for taking advantage of her trust. He feels even worse that it involved their children.\n\nThis whole thing has soured my SIL on the name Chloe. Now it only reminds her of the fight and hurt. She wants to come up with a completely new name, maybe one related to her hobby, like Mallory or Rita. She's going to take some time to not think about it. Their marriage isn't in danger, but a wound is there. Now that Mikey has admitted fault, it can heal, and it will with time.\n\nIf you learn anything from Mikey, learn that everyone makes mistakes. If someone truly loves you, they can usually forgive you. However, to earn that forgiveness you have to admit to what you did, not double down and try to trick your way out of it.", "created_utc": 1672100497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw1fex/update_my_brother_tricked_his_wife_into_naming/", "score": 3216, "replies": ["[original](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuh0c0/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_no_one_in_our_family/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "This is all your SIL's FIL fault for his love of life.", "Are you talking about my dad?", "Oh my god I can\u2019t believe this website is free", "Yeah this one's going in the BORU Hall of Fame", "[removed]", "Your brother sucks.

I had to cut a lot out of my original draft of the update to stay under 3k characters. I wanted to say more about my brother's personality. He is an amazing father and loving husband. When my SIL got invited on a trip she really wanted to do when Ricky was eight months old my brother made sure there was nothing to impede her trip. He took care of everything, and she came home to a spotless house.\n\nThe thing about Mikey is that he is impulsive. On a less charitable day I might even call him childish. He's also one of those people that rarely sees anything as a big deal. In his mind this was a cute and harmless prank. Only after our mom and his wife separately explained to him just how messed up it was did he get it.\n\nMy SIL told me when we were texting she had to use this example: \"Imagine you wanted me to try a food, but you weren't 100% I would agree. So you didn't tell me what it was. Then I tried it and asked you specifically what it was and you lied.\" He was horrified by that scenario and that's when it started to click.", "My SIL was only not talking to me that day because she was upset with my brother and confused about why he would lie, but she didn't want to start something in front of the kids or my parents, so she was trying to just say as little as possible and think about everything.

I might get a \"real\" apology at a later date, or I might not. It isn't really about me.", "He is very embarrassed about that now.

They promised for better or worse and right now it's worse. She's hurt. She feels like he took advantage of her unconditional trust in him that caused her not to question when he spun a yarn for her. All the same, he has admitted that he is in the wrong, apologized, and agreed that whatever name makes her feel better about this will be the name regardless of his preference. Healing from this will take time, but she is willing to put in the effort to forgive and he is willing to put in the effort to work for that forgiveness.", "Commentors on the last post already warned me about those names.", "lmao", "Are you having a stroke?", "I remember that!

I thought the emphasis was on the taking care of an eight month old by themself so the other partner could get away. Which for me is a very nice thing to do for someone from either end of the gender/parental role.

I read the place being clean as an afterthought, as like I said I don't expect the place to be spotless just intact upon return. cleaning and chores and life is hard enough just by myself, can't imagine having to take care of a kid and keep it spotless too. Also I think we expect the homemaker to keep things clean and take care of the kid regardless of gender as that's part of the job they usually agree to. If my partner is working and Im stay at home parenting Im gonna assume im doing a greater portion of the cooking and cleaning, as the workweek is designed with the idea of a homemaker in mind (which for the record I think is bullshit and Im against if they want raise wages to make that possible). So then having all those responsibilities given to one person when the other one leaves, to me, is a point where honestly I wouldn't expect the Homemaker to keep everything spotless.

(I know you probably picked that up somewhere but no.) You have to remember there are two versions of Jason Todd and that young Jason, either version, wasn't a jerk. He did probably kill what's his face but I don't blame him for that. I don't think he saw another option. A lot of the later young Jason was terrible were retcons and they were still mostly him being overprotective and willing to be violent over it, which isn't Damian at all.

Jason's issue is his entire life is an episode of 60 minutes.) \n\nStephanie is more ripped off from Jason I think (the original intro of the character was to be Robin's Robin to give Tim, who was more serious, some levity. She was not meant to be a main character. That only happened because Dixon wanted to move Tim out of Batman to Blue Beetle and it got the green light and then was yanked when he started setting it up.) \n\nA lot of Jason's life story was given to Stephanie but less terrible. Jason's mom was a hardcore addict, Steph's mom was a pill addict. Jason's mom overdosed. Steph's mom got better. Jason's dad was a henchman beat to death by Two Face, Steph's dad is a D list villain quasi ripping off the Riddler, he died. There's a list of stuff here. \n\nGrown up Jason also isn't necessarily a jerk. If you write out his life story, it's fucked. Jason is supposed to be bad or evil because we're supposed to agree with Batman. I largely don't agree with Batman. How many innocent people have to suffer so bad people can have another second chance. I think the Robins all grew up to become the heroes they themselves needed when they first became Robin. \n\nI started reading comics when Jason Todd v. 2 was introduced. He was not a bad kid.

I consistently say, if someone makes an honest mistake, owns up to it and takes actions to redress it, that's fine.\n\nIt's AH behavior if someone makes an honest mistake and doubles-down on it, or continues repeating it over a long period of time.  After all, the most meaningful apology when we make a mistake is not to do the same thing again.", "If my boyfriend would let me, I'd have the whole batfam. Still though I can see MAYBE not wanting to name a kid after Jason Todd, just based on his storyline. Though it would be cool if you had like, a sidekick-y kid named Richard, a rebel named Jason, a gay kid named Tim, and a future zookeeper named Damien. No Cass though, that'd be brutal, and I'd be worried if you had a girl named Barbara and a boy named Richard, maybe don't let them get too close.", "I reckon this'll be the next \"reddit story gets recapped as news\" on buzzfeed or mumsnet wherever.", "Barbara is also a nice girl name", "Hmm... I am oblivious to comic book lore, but there's a Richard, Jason, Stephanie in my family. Secret batman dishing out names?", "Tbh my biggest problem wouldn't have been the lie, but the choice of Stephanie over Cassandra \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Maybe they should call the baby Carrie now\u2026", "Thank you for the follow up, props to your brother for owning up and apologizing.\n\nBut I mean they've made it this far, might as well go with Stephanie lol", "r/MuseumOfReddit", "Thank you! I had absolutely no idea what was going on here.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

That\u2019s bare minimum.\n\nHe sounds like he has Peter Pan syndrome and everyone around him just lets him live in Never Never Land.\n\nFor the record I literally have a tattoo that says fangirl and had a doctor who themed wedding. I\u2019m deep into nerd culture.  Your brother has main character syndrome", "Seriously.  It's a coordinated campaign of lying/manipulation going on for *years*.  That's like the exact opposite of impulsive.", "It\u2019s not even that Ricky was Richard\u2026for me, the first Robin is and always has been Dick Grayson, I hardly ever think of him as \u201cRichard Grayson,\u201d and even if I did I would never think of him as \u201cRicky Grayson,\u201d nor do I recall any comics or movies ever calling the first Robin \u201cRicky.\u201d Mikey was incredibly subtle here, and I think (like some people have said) the first two names were a non-issue, this only became a problem when he resorted to making up a dead family member to keep his pattern going for the new daughter.", "I disagree. They talked it out. She expressed her feelings. He listened and owned up to mistakes. They are *actively* working through this rather than letting resentment build up or just saying \"eff this see ya\". Sounds like they are the picture of how a healthy couple should be handling a major issue like this and I can't fathom what a couple's counselor would tell them to do differently \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "This is Carrie Kelley erasure.", "I know someone who has three kids with X-men names, and it's a complete coincidence.", "Marthaaaaa", "I have a cousin that makes some terrible life decisions.  She has a child named Ryu because one of her terrible life decisions was to marry someone else that ALSO makes terrible life decisions.", "There is a doctor named Loki Skylizard, though in his case his parents gave him a normal name at birth and let him change it at 12.", "Carrie? I thought it was Cassie (Cassandra Cain)?", "That takes on name off our baby list lol. My husband doesn't like Batman though, he's mire of a Supernatural guy, so we'll probably do Samara or Lorelai", "Carrie Kelley was Robin in The Dark Knight Returns and the sequels. \n\nCassandra Cain was Batgirl but was never a Robin."]}
