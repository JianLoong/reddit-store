I am not the type of person to constantly need to know where my GF is. I trust her, she is an adult and has the right to go/do as she pleases without someone badgering her about where she is and who she's with. \n\nFor this trip though, I asked her if she would mind to send me nightly texts to let me know they all made it back to the hotel okay. New Orleans can be a dangerous place, and I'm a bit worried for a group of young women out late in downtown NO. She scoffed a bit when I asked, but agreed.\n\nTo get to the point, she didn't check in for two straight nights after getting there. The first day I just assumed she was having fun and forgot, the second day I started to be a little worried. The third morning I decided to call her (she hadn't opened the couple texts I sent) just to make sure she was okay. Before I could even speak she let me know exactly how ridiculous she thought I was being, not yelling but obviously upset. She, essentially, said I was being overbearing and needed to chill out and let them have their fun.\n\nShe hung up on me and we haven't talked in the three days since then. She won't be coming home for another week. I don't want to bother her, but I also want to apologize (even though I'm not sure I did anything wrong...)\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: I added a comment with some more background", "created_utc": 1684426738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l3edn/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_send_checkin_texts_while/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking for a curfew! I\u2019d be worried she\u2019s taking a vacation from the relationship.", "Personally, I consider it common courtesy to check in with your partner when you're on vacation or out at night.  Hell, my friend group gives check in texts when we get home from a night out in our own city.\n\n\nNOLA is a different animal now.  I'm saying that as someone who is there a couple times a month.  When I'm there, I have my location turned on so even people IN MY GROUP can have that extra peace of mind.\n\nNTA.  Anyone who says you are hasn't been paying attention.", "I grew up in NOLA.

It can be a dangerous place, especially for young drunk tourists.  \n\nIs it possible that you care more about her than she does about you? That might explain it.  \n\nYou\u2019re sound like a nice guy here, and not a control freak, so don\u2019t let her make you feel like one.  \n\nTake care!", "Need info.  How long have you been in a relationship?  Maybe she is not considering the relationship quite the same way you are.  If you are in a longer term monogamous relationship and she cannot text you even once per day, then she is not your gf anymore.", "NTA if you come of a place of genuine concern.\n\nThe way to go about this is changing concern checkups for \"dont forget to send me a good morning\"\n\nThat way it does not feel like you are looking on how late you go to bed or where you at and so on.\n\nGood morning, did you have fun yesterday, when you have 5 minutes call me so I can tell you my day.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been married34 years, and we touch base daily by at least text if one of us is away, or if we\u2019re doing a long drive, say 4 hours. Just a brief confirmation that all is fine. \n\nThat\u2019s what people who care about each other do.", "Thank you all so much for the perspective! Just to clarify a bit:\n\nWe are not living together, though we do spend a lot of time together at one place or the other. We met a long time ago in college, then happened to bump into each other a while back and started dating 5mo ago.\n\nWe don't typically text all that often since both of us prefer face to face, in-person communication. I never ask her for scheduled texts or calls, I just wanted some piece of mind since I knew they would be out late, probably drunk, as a group of young women who someone might try to take advantage of or mug or whatever else might happen. I don't think they are incapable of taking care of themselves!\n\nIf we don't see each other in person for a few days, it is quite normal for us not to text/call very much during that time. That probably seems weird to most people, but that's how we've always been and it's the reason we fell out of touch for a while after college. I feel as if it makes the time we spend together better since we tell each other everything in person, I don't know about her. I didn't expect daily pics and things, I've just been excited to hear all about it when she gets back.\n\nI'm taking the advice to wait until she gets back to heart. I'll just explain everything then and hope we can figure out what went wrong. Thank you all!", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and just say that I personally hate sending check-in texts. I\u2019m not sure why, it just feels like I\u2019m being infantilized or controlled, or like I\u2019m being asked to manage the other person\u2019s anxiety. I understand doing it after a flight or a long drive, and texts during the day to exchange updates are great, but checking in every night seems like overkill. If your girlfriend is going out drinking, she probably just wants to come back to her room and pass out.\n\nThat said, you weren\u2019t wrong to ask, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to check in if she didn\u2019t plan to follow through, and she shouldn\u2019t have gotten upset with you on the phone, so overall NTA.", "Honestly, I think it\u2019s kind of sus that she didn\u2019t offer to do this herself. \n\nI would expect her to want to check in with you from an a emotional standpoint of wanting to see how your day went, etc., rather than even a safety standpoint.  \n\nJust because you\u2019re on vacation doesn\u2019t mean the other person doesn\u2019t exist.", "If you guys live together, pack up your stuff and leave this isn't a relationship worth keeping.", "NTA.  People in a romantic relationship have a right to expect basic checkins during long separations, and she agreed to do it.\n\nIf she didn't want to, she should have had that discussion at the time, not agreed then decided not to.\n\n>  but I also want to apologize (even though I'm not sure I did anything wrong...)\n\nYou haven't done anything wrong, and shouldn't apologize.  She, on the other hand, has lied to you, declined to communicate honestly with you, and seems to hold you in contempt:\n\n> She, essentially, said I was being overbearing and needed to chill out and let them have their fun.\n\nApparently a single text in the evening is enough of a burden to ruin her entire vacation.  That should tell you everything you need to know about how she views you.", "nta. it\u2019s not like you asked for hourly check ins.", "Dear god I was in NO for the Jazz fest a few weeks a go.  I was sending the woman I had just started dating pics each day just because it was exciting and I wanted to share (I did check, she didn't mind and liked seeing NO since she had never been)\n\nThe near two weeks of radio silence is concerning.  Like my GF and I send good morning and good night texts every day and we live 14 minutes from each other.", "NTA. You're not asking for a detailed report, just to know that she's safe.", "NTA. I will say that I\u2019m not sure your gf considers this relationship as important and potentially as monogamous as you do. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s there to sleep with other people at all (I hate that this sub seems to jump to that conclusion so often), but for a committed partner touching base once a day should not be a big deal. If I can\u2019t touch base with my partner for a day when I can it typically comes with an apology, not a tongue lashing. She doesn\u2019t seem to care that much about your concern\u2014which to me makes me think she is not as committed to you as you are to her.", "You're NTA. The \"safety check\" is a routine thing for most couples. She's obviously seeing it as a control issue though.", "Hmmm, NTA, but it feels like you need to understand what she's not telling you directly. When she scoffed and agreed, you got her real answer first--she's scoffing because she thinks you're being ridiculous, agreeing to get you to shut up. When you called on Day 3, she let you have it because she thought you got the message the first time: she thinks you're being ridiculous. \n\nIt's hard to objectively call this one, because a lot of it depends on where both of you are in this relationship. It honestly sounds like she feels smothered, which is why the two weeks away from you without having to check in might be so important to her, so I really suggest you use this time on your own to evaluate your relationship and see if you guys are in the same place. If your relationship is relatively new, it may also be that she doesn't enjoy being asked to check in with another person about her activities when she's away. \n\nLet her enjoy her remaining week away. You'll have plenty to talk about when she gets back. Best of luck!", "Honestly, I would probably dump her. She\u2019s hanging up on you and not even opening your texts. She\u2019s probably out fucking around.", "please post an update after GF gets back from the vacation\n\nAlso, stop reaching out to her on her vacation she has unequivocally told you how she feels on the subject", "Based strictly on the info you provided, NTA (assuming you hadn't been informed that she'd be checking in daily with someone else).If something were to happen to them, like they disappeared, who would contact authorities to start an investigation?  When traveling or hiking, someone should *always* be generally aware of where you plan to be and when you plan to be back at your safe base. Always, always, always.", "Nta. Sounds like she's not into the relationship honestly. Her behavior definitely  makes you question what she's doing there.", "N T A for wanting to know she's safe but kinda Y T A for wanting scheduled check ins. You could have easily just text her through out the week to ask how the trip was going and ask if she was having fun. \n\n\nAsking for scheduled check ins could have put her on the defensive because she doesn't need your to parent her or take on what may be seen as a \"protective role\". You all should definitely be a talk about why you asked for the check ins so she doesn't think it's about control.", "NTA and for me personally this would be a dealbreaker.", "NTA she agreed to check in texts to appease your concern then DOESN'T CHECK IN? It's one thing to have a problem with checking with an S/O (I guess) but to agree to one and then not do so is beyond fucked up! I woulda been out of my mind with worry, how could she expect you to be otherwise? And then she berates you for being worried over her not checking in as she agreed to ? Fuck that.\n\nI mean maybe I'm biased because I had fairly protective parents so I grew up inured to the existence of check in texts as a means of reassuring people and I can get that it's weird / a hassle for people who haven't but I still think this reeks of inconsideration. I mean whether or not she thought it was unnecessary she AGREED to it before she left. And then utterly failed to care enough about your feelings to actually do it.", "NTA, dump her ass.  She is trash and doesn't respect you.  Who wouldn't be concerned about their significant other when they are gone for 2 weeks on vacation where alcohol and other stupid young people are involved?  \n\nThe behavior is super sus. She is probably cheating and projecting.", "NTA\nI  can't imagine not texting my man every day at LEAST once.", "NTA: You don't need to apologize to anyone but yourself. She's gaslighting you.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't asking for a 2 hour phone call or hourly texts.   You weren't asking for a minute by minute accounting of what she did the day. \nYou were asking for about 140 seconds of her time out of 14 days to text 'we're good' or 'back safe at hotel' or 'go shit in a hat' - hell, sounds like you'd accept a middle finger emoji...", "Your girlfriend is an adult. Plenty of women go to NOLA in groups. It\u2019s a hot spot for bachelorette parties. It\u2019s not as dangerous as you think in the touristy spots.", "Nta at all. It's definitely not too much to ask for one text a day to make sure she's ok", "NTA.", "INFO:\n\nWas she texting you through the day and just forgetting the nightly check-ins? Or was she just not communicating with you at all?", "NTA at all. You have nothing to apologize for. There is either a lot more going on here behind the scenes that led up to this, or OP's GF just doesn't actually really care about him much.\n\nHonestly, I'd either be leaving the relationship, or, if I felt so strongly that I wanted to try and save it, I'd be having an extremely frank conversation as soon as she walked in the door, with a bag already packed to leave in case it goes sideways right away (which, at this point, I would say the relationship is already over, frankly, GF isn't invested in it whatsoever).", "NTA, like 100%. Its perfectly customary to check in with a partner during trips. I think maybe she is feeling generally suffocated and instead of telling you directly she\u2019s doing it like this (childish). Sounds like you two need to talk about where each of you stand in the relationship.", "NTA, like 100%. Its perfectly customary to check in with a partner during trips.

Is she wants to go the entire trip without talking with you at all it's clear she doesn't value you or the relationship. For fucks sake your asking for a text a day so you know she's safe. That's not asking for anything but 2 seconds out of her day. Her response is extremely childish and defensive. I wouldn't be shocked if there's more than just her friends around", "NTA. It\u2019s odd that she\u2019s refusing to check in. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking her for hourly updates. Her getting mad over it is unnecessary. You sure she went on this trip with her friends?", "NTA.\n\nI would *never* go days without checking in with my boyfriend. First of all, dailyish communication is normal in longterm relationships. Second of all, if I'm on a trip I want him to know I'm fine. The fact that you specifically asked her to keep you apprised and she still didn't is a red flag. Why did she want to forget about you so badly?\n\nI'm getting the vibe she doesn't actually like you very much and was using this trip to escape you. Don't stay with someone who treats you like that, dude. She doesn't care enough to even so much as open a text, much less send one, so you know she's alive. You can do better.", "NTA - even with your caveat that y\u2019all prefer face to face communication vs phone/text. There\u2019s a handful of cities in the US where this request is totally valid and NOLA is one of them. I\u2019ve absolutely had encounters there than made me a bit uncomfortable and pretty much always try to have at least one person with me when I\u2019m there. \n\nI do think there\u2019s nuance in how the request was asked and you may not have asked it in the best way. This could partially explain intentionally ignoring your texts and her reaction when you called, however, that doesn\u2019t fully justify her actions.", "NTA- I totally get wanting to hear she had made it their safely. I do that with my own family and many of my friends.  At least that first text you'd have known.  If she did not intend to text you, she needed to be an adult and tell you that before she left rather then pretending to agree.   She agreed to text you, so after 2 days you called and asked how she was, SHE blew up for really no reason.  I dont see why you'd need to apologize.", "Dump here. Who starts a phone call yelling at someone?", "My girlfriend would call and text every night. It doesn\u2019t sound like she respects your feelings. I would probably ditch her and find someone that does. I can easily see the whole relationship turning sour quickly when she returns. \nNTA: just stop messaging her and if she doesn\u2019t start reaching out just move out before she gets back and be done", "NTA. I think most people in a happy and committed relationship, unless they are in a place with no phone service whatsoever or otherwise unreacheble, would want to send a daily text to their SO just to check in/let them know they are ok when away for several days. \n\nI also honestly think you are wrong in your reasoning that New Orleans is dangerous for a group of women, since it's basically one of the hen-do capitals of America, but that is beside the point. \n\nShe is purposely avoiding you when out with her friends. \nIs this a new thing? Have you been together long? Is this something that you can overlook in a relationship? That is up to you.", "You are NTA but almost naive as well.", "NTA  provided you were not using the check ins to monitor her where abouts vs simply knowing she was ok.\n\nIs there a history of you being over bearing? Hard to know your relationship dynamics, but it sounds like all communication is now being withheld and if you have respected boundaries and showed you trusted her, that is not right.  \n\nAs an aside, if someone i was involved with did not want to speak with me at all for 2 weeks at all while on vacation,  it would get me questioning.  My previous partners have been eager to share pictures and the excitement of what they have done or were doing.", "NTA. I guarantee if you were the one on vacation, she'd demand multiple updates throughout the day. Your request was normal and her refusal is disrespectful if you and your relationship.", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult and can manage herself in \u201cbig, scary\u201d NOLA.", "ESH. Your girlfriend for flipping out at you for calling, because tbh, it is reasonable if you are USUALLY in communication with your partner daily, especially if you've had an agreement, to check in after 2 days of no contact. \n\nYou because being worried about a \"group of young women out late in downtown NO\" is, likely unintentionally, really condescending. She's an adult and can take care of herself. I do think it's totally reasonable to have a convo about how much you'll be communicating during a vacation, but that's a 2-way discussion.", "NTA. You asked her to put your mind at ease regarding her and her friends' safety and she agreed. Then went radio silent, not checking in or contacting you at all for two days????? Not even to say hi???? Or send a picture to show you what they are up to??? You are not overbearing. I consider checking in once a day the bare minimum even when I know my SO is not in a potentially dangerous situation (being an intoxicated woman in a group of intoxicated women, out late in an area with a bad rep definitely sounds potentially dangerous and your caution seems warranted)", "NTA. It was such a small ask, and you even made sure not to go nuts when she missed a check in. And the fact that she criticized you on the call before you even spoke is a bit much too. Sounds like this girl would prefer to be single.", "NTA if you know how bad the crime is there right now. My friend's roommate grew up there and she's always telling my friend not to go certain places, sometimes depending on the time.

Once a day isn\u2019t an absurd ask at all.", "It feels really weird that the girlfriend isn\u2019t texting at all. Like, I get it, she\u2019s on vacation, but when I\u2019m on vacation and I see something cool or something funny happens, I shoot a quick picture or text to my BFF about it. It takes less than 30 seconds and it maintains the closeness of our relationship when we\u2019re away from each other. Is there a reason OP\u2019s girlfriend doesn\u2019t want that with her partner?", "Right! NOLA is beautiful but I'd be scared downtown even with my best mates. It can be pretty dangerous and getting mugged is no joke. Far too common, so the least she could do is check in.", "This.  All I want to know is that you're not dead in a ditch. \n\nNTA", "Yea\u2026 I grew up near NOLA, and I avoid it like the plague at night, and around Mardi Gras. Too much crazy shit going on. \n\nI\u2019d rather go to BR parades and not have to worry as much, even if they\u2019re not as spectacular.", "And if she really didn\u2019t want to do it she could have said so beforehand. Defo NTA", "Thank you, I'll have to give that some thought", "Almost five months, not crazy long but definitely monogamous. My family has just always been the \"text me when you get there type,\" maybe she isn't that way", "That's what intended, I just didn't want to make the title super wordy. Thanks for the advice!", "Would you say it's normal for you both to communicate in some form at least once a day?", ">Just because you\u2019re on vacation doesn\u2019t mean the other person doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nPure speculation on my part but I think she is taking a \"vacation\" from the relationship", "What if it's his house?", "Thank you", "did a three day drive to FL in Jan.  Texted my sister my destination for the day when I set out in the morning and an \"I arrived\" in the evening so someone would be able to at least start looking for me", "Thank you", "It is absolutely dangerous. I live in the French Quarter. There are shootings all the time. I\u2019d love it if someone was wanting me to check in when I got home every night.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve also been robbed and assaulted downtown when I was walking to/from work. Had multiple trespassers in my courtyard. One left a loaded gun behind and another took apart my garden shears and tried to break in using one of the blades. It may look like Disneyland here, but it\u2019s not. Behaving sensibly and being aware of your surroundings will not always protect you.", "If she didnt want to text him, then she needed to be an adult and tell him that before she left rather then lying and saying she would.", "She said she'd do something, then she didn't do it.  If she's an adult, she's accountable for that.", "Plenty of people go to Syria and make it back alive too. What\u2019s the OP is asking for is just normal stuff. I would say the same if she were in Davenport, Iowa.", "I wasn't really expecting texts through the day. We talk face to face and don't text each other much at all, so that part was normal. I realize that probably sounds really odd too, but had I not asked her to let me know they were okay I probably wouldn't have expected a text the whole trip. I was planning on hearing about it when she got back.", "Agreed, I'm beginning to think I might have phrased it badly in the beginning without realizing it and now it's just a misunderstanding that's blown up a bit. Thank you", "I don't necessarily think New Orleans is dangerous, just that late night bars in a very large city can be dangerous. Thanks for the input though, I guess she might have the same impression", "Definitely not monitoring! I trust her, just want to make sure they're okay.", ">You because being worried about a \"group of young women out late in downtown NO\" is, likely unintentionally, really condescending.\n\nIs it? I've been told numerous times by women that I don't understand how scary it is to be a woman, how every woman has to be safe at night (and in general during encounters with men) because they never know what might happen to them, and that I take my safety for granted. So am I supposed to think that women are at risk of being attacked late at night, or am I supposed to think that everyone has the same level of safety regardless of gender? Seems like either way I'm going to piss someone off.", "Yeah, I've been thinking on it for a minute and I think leading with a request to send nightly check-in texts can easily be misunderstood as, \"Please report nightly so I know you didn't get in trouble, and also so I can establish what time you get back at the hotel.\"", "It sounds like she doesn't care about you very much. It's not hard to send text messages, you weren't asking for constant attention. Sending one text message a day is literally so quick and easy, and personally I can't imagine going that long without texting someone I care about and am dating", "NTA and I would dump her.  She is not serious about the relationship if she cannot even text once per day. She went to a party city for two weeks with her girl friends.  Not going to say she is doing her anything, but it\u2019s a big red flag.", "I\u2019m a grown adult, live on my own and I still text my parents when I reach my office and leave the office. Haha.", "I don't think I'd respond very well if somebody I had been dating for five months (which to me is not very long) asked upfront for daily checkins when I was on a girls' holiday. But that may be because I'm an older generation, idk.", "In general is she a thoughtful person? I would kind of assume not and this is just a glaring example of when you need a thoughtful partner.", "If we see each other, definitely. We spend time together most days. If we don't see eachother its normal for us to just catch up later and not text or call. Very unusual for a relationship, I know. It was very out of the ordinary for me to ask for a text every day.", "Shit, I don't think she considers it a serious relationship in the first place.", "I agree", "I know someone who sings in bars in NO and stopped singing at one particular bar after a guy pulled a gun on her and demanded she keep singing", "Completely agree. To me it's the same as saying \"let me know when you get home\" after someone leaves your house which nobody has a problem with", "And I do it for my parents too and sometimes I forget especially when on vacation.", "You're right, that does sound odd! Are you okay with this level of communication? \n\nI am historically terrible at the \"got home safe\" text and there are definitely situations where I could see myself taking her side. You don't sound like you're being overbearing at all, so this isn't one of them. NTA.", "New Orleans is dangerous", "I honestly hadn't even thought of it that way, but I can definitely see it now. Thank you.", ">personally I can't imagine going that long without texting someone I care about and am dating\n\nI have been with my S/O for 5+ years (living together for 3) and sometimes I text them I miss them \u2014 while we\u2019re both at work and will see each other in a few hours. We aren\u2019t needy either, we do plenty of things apart, including separate vacations with respective friend groups.\n\nI cannot **not** imagine texting just to catch up with them while on a long vacation away either!", "A psychologist asked me (in an in-office session after I got raped and was confiding about certain others in my life) if a certain guy who had been acting like he had feelings for me wanting me to pick him to be my boyfriend if the guy ever talks to me on social media. He wanted to see it since I trust people's words and get taken advantage of. My doctor told me \"If name has time to pee, he has time to text you.\" since I kept saying he was too busy to chat with me online.", "No, lets be honest: if the genders were reversed, at least 75% of the posts would be pointing out the idea of 'on vacation with a likeminded group in a party city and wants to be left alone with zero vacation means fucking around.'\n\nSo yeah, she's probably fucking around.\n\nI think she and OP have different views of what the relationship is and how serious it is, which is fine, but zero communication about it makes it not fine, and her actively lying to OP makes it her fault.", "This is an extreme rarity though. Not saying there is anything wrong with it but you have to be in the <1% range of people who do this.", "Exactly! I've done this with friends after leaving some place late at night. I've had non-monogamous casual dating dudes ask me to text them if I left their place late to make sure I got home okay.", "Yes, we just don't really ever text each other. We are both very face to face oriented.", "I'm sure people are going to hate what I'm about to say but I'm going to say it anyway.\n\nIf you've only been together 5 months and your normal habit is not to have text/phone contact every day then it's possible she's just not thinking of it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand that you're concerned about her safety, but if you guys aren't the text every day type and she's not a check in kind of person then I get why she's forgetting to do it, especially when she's out with a bunch of friends and they're all distracted by each other and all the stuff they are doing.\n\nIt might be easier for me to see things this way because I've never been a check in person myself and when things get busy or I've had a long day, I can forget other people even exist. \n\nMy husband isn't a check in person either and we travel separately for things all the time, neither one of us have panicked if we don't hear from each other for a day or two when we know shit is busy.Of course we both have rampant adhd so I'm sure that contributes.\n\nI understand that this can be a big point of contention in relationships and it be very difficult to find a solution that works for both parties, especially when both sides have very different expectations and experiences.\n\nI don't think either of you are wrong in this situation and the only thing I can really do is have a discussion about it when she gets back. It's possible that you can find a way to handle it in the future, but it's also possible that u won't, some people think it's obvious that u check in and others just don't think it's a big deal. \n\nIf u are both types, it's entirely possible that you'll never agree on this and if u can live with it, cool, but if not then it might be something that goes in the we might not be compatible column. Only u guys can decide and there's no right or wrong answer, only what works for u and what doesn't.", "They live together, I think.\n\nEdit:  why did this get down-voted?  Lol, Reddit\ud83d\ude02", "Unfortunately, that\u2019s not surprising.", "Yes, I'm okay with it. Neither of us are much on texting, I've just grown accustomed to sending my family the \"got home\" texts because they always ask and I thought it might be nice to hear from her this time so I didnt have to worry at all. I think we just got mixed up and need to talk about it.", "I\u2019m fairly certain bathroom breaks are when my husband texts me to ask how my days going.", "I guess I\u2019m in the top 1%!", "I think after reading through everyone's thoughts this all just kind of blew up as a misunderstanding. Thank you for your comment, we will definitely talk through it", "Well, he says they've only been together for five months:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l3edn/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_send_checkin_texts_while/jknkkz8/\n\nSo if they do live together, well, now he's learned a valuable lesson about not entangling your lives before you really know the other person.  Five months simply isn't long enough to know somebody well enough to be moving in together.", "Yeah I think so as well, hopefully that doesn't mean it's a case of the OP thinking it's serious, and the GF just thinking 'eh, it'll do for now to cover half the rent.' Sure doesn't seem like she cares much about him to me.", "lol That was funny but I'm sure he meant if someone can make time to use the bathroom, then they can also make the time to text me even once.", "It's nice you have a such a close relationship with your parents!"]}
