I am not the type of person to constantly need to know where my GF is. I trust her, she is an adult and has the right to go/do as she pleases without someone badgering her about where she is and who she's with. \n\nFor this trip though, I asked her if she would mind to send me nightly texts to let me know they all made it back to the hotel okay. New Orleans can be a dangerous place, and I'm a bit worried for a group of young women out late in downtown NO. She scoffed a bit when I asked, but agreed.\n\nTo get to the point, she didn't check in for two straight nights after getting there. The first day I just assumed she was having fun and forgot, the second day I started to be a little worried. The third morning I decided to call her (she hadn't opened the couple texts I sent) just to make sure she was okay. Before I could even speak she let me know exactly how ridiculous she thought I was being, not yelling but obviously upset. She, essentially, said I was being overbearing and needed to chill out and let them have their fun.\n\nShe hung up on me and we haven't talked in the three days since then. She won't be coming home for another week. I don't want to bother her, but I also want to apologize (even though I'm not sure I did anything wrong...)\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: I added a comment with some more background", "created_utc": 1684426738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l3edn/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_send_checkin_texts_while/", "score": 545, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking for a curfew! I\u2019d be worried she\u2019s taking a vacation from the relationship.", "Personally, I consider it common courtesy to check in with your partner when you're on vacation or out at night.  Hell, my friend group gives check in texts when we get home from a night out in our own city.\n\n\nNOLA is a different animal now.  I'm saying that as someone who is there a couple times a month.  When I'm there, I have my location turned on so even people IN MY GROUP can have that extra peace of mind.\n\nNTA.  Anyone who says you are hasn't been paying attention.", "I grew up in NOLA.

It can be a dangerous place, especially for young drunk tourists.  \n\nIs it possible that you care more about her than she does about you? That might explain it.  \n\nYou\u2019re sound like a nice guy here, and not a control freak, so don\u2019t let her make you feel like one.  \n\nTake care!", "Need info.  How long have you been in a relationship?  Maybe she is not considering the relationship quite the same way you are.  If you are in a longer term monogamous relationship and she cannot text you even once per day, then she is not your gf anymore.", "NTA if you come of a place of genuine concern.\n\nThe way to go about this is changing concern checkups for \"dont forget to send me a good morning\"\n\nThat way it does not feel like you are looking on how late you go to bed or where you at and so on.\n\nGood morning, did you have fun yesterday, when you have 5 minutes call me so I can tell you my day.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been married34 years, and we touch base daily by at least text if one of us is away, or if we\u2019re doing a long drive, say 4 hours. Just a brief confirmation that all is fine. \n\nThat\u2019s what people who care about each other do.", "Thank you all so much for the perspective! Just to clarify a bit:\n\nWe are not living together, though we do spend a lot of time together at one place or the other. We met a long time ago in college, then happened to bump into each other a while back and started dating 5mo ago.\n\nWe don't typically text all that often since both of us prefer face to face, in-person communication. I never ask her for scheduled texts or calls, I just wanted some piece of mind since I knew they would be out late, probably drunk, as a group of young women who someone might try to take advantage of or mug or whatever else might happen. I don't think they are incapable of taking care of themselves!\n\nIf we don't see each other in person for a few days, it is quite normal for us not to text/call very much during that time. That probably seems weird to most people, but that's how we've always been and it's the reason we fell out of touch for a while after college. I feel as if it makes the time we spend together better since we tell each other everything in person, I don't know about her. I didn't expect daily pics and things, I've just been excited to hear all about it when she gets back.\n\nI'm taking the advice to wait until she gets back to heart. I'll just explain everything then and hope we can figure out what went wrong. Thank you all!", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and just say that I personally hate sending check-in texts. I\u2019m not sure why, it just feels like I\u2019m being infantilized or controlled, or like I\u2019m being asked to manage the other person\u2019s anxiety. I understand doing it after a flight or a long drive, and texts during the day to exchange updates are great, but checking in every night seems like overkill. If your girlfriend is going out drinking, she probably just wants to come back to her room and pass out.\n\nThat said, you weren\u2019t wrong to ask, she shouldn\u2019t have agreed to check in if she didn\u2019t plan to follow through, and she shouldn\u2019t have gotten upset with you on the phone, so overall NTA.", "Honestly, I think it\u2019s kind of sus that she didn\u2019t offer to do this herself. \n\nI would expect her to want to check in with you from an a emotional standpoint of wanting to see how your day went, etc., more than even a safety standpoint.  \n\nJust because you\u2019re on vacation doesn\u2019t mean the other person doesn\u2019t exist.", "If you guys live together, pack up your stuff and leave this isn't a relationship worth keeping.", "NTA.  People in a romantic relationship have a right to expect basic checkins during long separations, and she agreed to do it.\n\nIf she didn't want to, she should have had that discussion at the time, not agreed then decided not to.\n\n>  but I also want to apologize (even though I'm not sure I did anything wrong...)\n\nYou haven't done anything wrong, and shouldn't apologize.  She, on the other hand, has lied to you, declined to communicate honestly with you, and seems to hold you in contempt:\n\n> She, essentially, said I was being overbearing and needed to chill out and let them have their fun.\n\nApparently a single text in the evening is enough of a burden to ruin her entire vacation.  That should tell you everything you need to know about how she views you.", "nta. it\u2019s not like you asked for hourly check ins.", "Dear god I was in NO for the Jazz fest a few weeks a go.  I was sending the woman I had just started dating pics each day just because it was exciting and I wanted to share (I did check, she didn't mind and liked seeing NO since she had never been)\n\nThe near two weeks of radio silence is concerning.  Like my GF and I send good morning and good night texts every day and we live 14 minutes from each other.", "NTA. You're not asking for a detailed report, just to know that she's safe.", "NTA. I will say that I\u2019m not sure your gf considers this relationship as important and potentially as monogamous as you do. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s there to sleep with other people at all (I hate that this sub seems to jump to that conclusion so often), but for a committed partner touching base once a day should not be a big deal. If I can\u2019t touch base with my partner for a day when I can it typically comes with an apology, not a tongue lashing. She doesn\u2019t seem to care that much about your concern\u2014which to me makes me think she is not as committed to you as you are to her.", "You're NTA. The \"safety check\" is a routine thing for most couples. She's obviously seeing it as a control issue though.", "Hmmm, NTA, but it feels like you need to understand what she's not telling you directly. When she scoffed and agreed, you got her real answer first--she's scoffing because she thinks you're being ridiculous, agreeing to get you to shut up. When you called on Day 3, she let you have it because she thought you got the message the first time: she thinks you're being ridiculous. \n\nIt's hard to objectively call this one, because a lot of it depends on where both of you are in this relationship. It honestly sounds like she feels smothered, which is why the two weeks away from you without having to check in might be so important to her, so I really suggest you use this time on your own to evaluate your relationship and see if you guys are in the same place. If your relationship is relatively new, it may also be that she doesn't enjoy being asked to check in with another person about her activities when she's away. \n\nLet her enjoy her remaining week away. You'll have plenty to talk about when she gets back. Best of luck!", "Honestly, I would probably dump her. She\u2019s hanging up on you and not even opening your texts. She\u2019s probably out fucking around.", "please post an update after GF gets back from the vacation\n\nAlso, stop reaching out to her on her vacation she has unequivocally told you how she feels on the subject", "Based strictly on the info you provided, NTA (assuming you hadn't been informed that she'd be checking in daily with someone else).If something were to happen to them, like they disappeared, who would contact authorities to start an investigation?  When traveling or hiking, someone should *always* be generally aware of where you plan to be and when you plan to be back at your safe base. Always, always, always.", "Nta. Sounds like she's not into the relationship honestly. Her behavior definitely  makes you question what she's doing there.", "N T A for wanting to know she's safe but kinda Y T A for wanting scheduled check ins. You could have easily just text her through out the week to ask how the trip was going and ask if she was having fun. \n\n\nAsking for scheduled check ins could have put her on the defensive because she doesn't need your to parent her or take on what may be seen as a \"protective role\". You all should definitely be a talk about why you asked for the check ins so she doesn't think it's about control.", "NTA and for me personally this would be a dealbreaker.", "NTA she agreed to check in texts to appease your concern then DOESN'T CHECK IN? It's one thing to have a problem with checking with an S/O (I guess) but to agree to one and then not do so is beyond fucked up! I woulda been out of my mind with worry, how could she expect you to be otherwise? And then she berates you for being worried over her not checking in as she agreed to ? Fuck that.\n\nI mean maybe I'm biased because I had fairly protective parents so I grew up inured to the existence of check in texts as a means of reassuring people and I can get that it's weird / a hassle for people who haven't but I still think this reeks of inconsideration. I mean whether or not she thought it was unnecessary she AGREED to it before she left. And then utterly failed to care enough about your feelings to actually do it.", "NTA, dump her ass.  She is trash and doesn't respect you.  Who wouldn't be concerned about their significant other when they are gone for 2 weeks on vacation where alcohol and other stupid young people are involved?  \n\nThe behavior is super sus. She is probably cheating and projecting.", "NTA\nI  can't imagine not texting my man every day at LEAST once.", "NTA: You don't need to apologize to anyone but yourself. She's gaslighting you.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't asking for a 2 hour phone call or hourly texts.   You weren't asking for a minute by minute accounting of what she did the day. \nYou were asking for about 140 seconds of her time out of 14 days to text 'we're good' or 'back safe at hotel' or 'go shit in a hat' - hell, sounds like you'd accept a middle finger emoji...", "Your girlfriend is an adult. Plenty of women go to NOLA in groups. It\u2019s a hot spot for bachelorette parties. It\u2019s not as dangerous as you think in the touristy spots.", "Nta at all. It's definitely not too much to ask for one text a day to make sure she's ok", "NTA.", "INFO:\n\nWas she texting you through the day and just forgetting the nightly check-ins? Or was she just not communicating with you at all?", "NTA at all. You have nothing to apologize for. There is either a lot more going on here behind the scenes that led up to this, or OP's GF just doesn't actually really care about him much.\n\nHonestly, I'd either be leaving the relationship, or, if I felt so strongly that I wanted to try and save it, I'd be having an extremely frank conversation as soon as she walked in the door, with a bag already packed to leave in case it goes sideways right away (which, at this point, I would say the relationship is already over, frankly, GF isn't invested in it whatsoever).", "NTA, like 100%. Its perfectly customary to check in with a partner during trips. I think maybe she is feeling generally suffocated and instead of telling you directly she\u2019s doing it like this (childish). Sounds like you two need to talk about where each of you stand in the relationship.", "NTA, like 100%. Its perfectly customary to check in with a partner during trips.

Is she wants to go the entire trip without talking with you at all it's clear she doesn't value you or the relationship. For fucks sake your asking for a text a day so you know she's safe. That's not asking for anything but 2 seconds out of her day. Her response is extremely childish and defensive. I wouldn't be shocked if there's more than just her friends around", "NTA. It\u2019s odd that she\u2019s refusing to check in. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re asking her for hourly updates. Her getting mad over it is unnecessary. You sure she went on this trip with her friends?", "NTA.\n\nI would *never* go days without checking in with my boyfriend. First of all, dailyish communication is normal in longterm relationships. Second of all, if I'm on a trip I want him to know I'm fine. The fact that you specifically asked her to keep you apprised and she still didn't is a red flag. Why did she want to forget about you so badly?\n\nI'm getting the vibe she doesn't actually like you very much and was using this trip to escape you. Don't stay with someone who treats you like that, dude. She doesn't care enough to even so much as open a text, much less send one, so you know she's alive. You can do better.", "NTA - even with your caveat that y\u2019all prefer face to face communication vs phone/text. There\u2019s a handful of cities in the US where this request is totally valid and NOLA is one of them. I\u2019ve absolutely had encounters there than made me a bit uncomfortable and pretty much always try to have at least one person with me when I\u2019m there. \n\nI do think there\u2019s nuance in how the request was asked and you may not have asked it in the best way. This could partially explain intentionally ignoring your texts and her reaction when you called, however, that doesn\u2019t fully justify her actions.", "NTA- I totally get wanting to hear she had made it their safely. I do that with my own family and many of my friends.  At least that first text you'd have known.  If she did not intend to text you, she needed to be an adult and tell you that before she left rather then pretending to agree.   She agreed to text you, so after 2 days you called and asked how she was, SHE blew up for really no reason.  I dont see why you'd need to apologize.", "Dump here. Who starts a phone call yelling at someone?", "My girlfriend would call and text every night. It doesn\u2019t sound like she respects your feelings. I would probably ditch her and find someone that does. I can easily see the whole relationship turning sour quickly when she returns. \nNTA: just stop messaging her and if she doesn\u2019t start reaching out just move out before she gets back and be done", "NTA. I think most people in a happy and committed relationship, unless they are in a place with no phone service whatsoever or otherwise unreacheble, would want to send a daily text to their SO just to check in/let them know they are ok when away for several days. \n\nI also honestly think you are wrong in your reasoning that New Orleans is dangerous for a group of women, since it's basically one of the hen-do capitals of America, but that is beside the point. \n\nShe is purposely avoiding you when out with her friends. \nIs this a new thing? Have you been together long? Is this something that you can overlook in a relationship? That is up to you.", "You are NTA but almost naive as well.", "NTA  provided you were not using the check ins to monitor her where abouts vs simply knowing she was ok.\n\nIs there a history of you being over bearing? Hard to know your relationship dynamics, but it sounds like all communication is now being withheld and if you have respected boundaries and showed you trusted her, that is not right.  \n\nAs an aside, if someone i was involved with did not want to speak with me at all for 2 weeks at all while on vacation,  it would get me questioning.  My previous partners have been eager to share pictures and the excitement of what they have done or were doing.", "NTA. I guarantee if you were the one on vacation, she'd demand multiple updates throughout the day. Your request was normal and her refusal is disrespectful if you and your relationship.", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult and can manage herself in \u201cbig, scary\u201d NOLA.", "ESH. Your girlfriend for flipping out at you for calling, because tbh, it is reasonable if you are USUALLY in communication with your partner daily, especially if you've had an agreement, to check in after 2 days of no contact. \n\nYou because being worried about a \"group of young women out late in downtown NO\" is, likely unintentionally, really condescending. She's an adult and can take care of herself. I do think it's totally reasonable to have a convo about how much you'll be communicating during a vacation, but that's a 2-way discussion.", "NTA. You asked her to put your mind at ease regarding her and her friends' safety and she agreed. Then went radio silent, not checking in or contacting you at all for two days????? Not even to say hi???? Or send a picture to show you what they are up to??? You are not overbearing. I consider checking in once a day the bare minimum even when I know my SO is not in a potentially dangerous situation (being an intoxicated woman in a group of intoxicated women, out late in an area with a bad rep definitely sounds potentially dangerous and your caution seems warranted)", "NTA. It was such a small ask, and you even made sure not to go nuts when she missed a check in. And the fact that she criticized you on the call before you even spoke is a bit much too. Sounds like this girl would prefer to be single.", "NTA if you know how bad the crime is there right now. My friend's roommate grew up there and she's always telling my friend not to go certain places, sometimes depending on the time.

Then basically explain exactly what you said here, that it wasn't a concern about what she was doing, it was wanting to know something terrible hadn't happened to her. I'd suggest communicating to her that wanting to make sure she's okay has nothing to do with trust, and isn't about keeping tabs on what she's doing, but is rooted in wanting to make sure she's safe.

You\u2019d think as a woman she\u2019d be well aware of how careful she should be in NOLA, and frankly I consider it a huge red flag that she\u2019s gone with her girlfriends for two weeks to a party city with minimal contact- that just screams infidelity to me, especially as she\u2019s trying to turn the tables and make it seem as if you\u2019re the one doing something wrong despite agreeing to check in with you and then failing to do so. \n\nEither way, I think you should take some time to re-evaluate this relationship because snapping on you for being justifiably worried is another red flag all on its own even if it turns out she wasn\u2019t cheating.", "NTA - I'm in my mid forties & single but when I'm away, I check in with my parents daily just so they dont worry.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s trying to start a fight to justify less than innocent actions? Sorry don\u2019t mean to plant ideas in your head but if this behavior is out of the norm for her it\u2019s something to consider. I go away with friends and always keep in touch with my partner.", "NTA", "I don't wanna be the devil on your shoulder but she's absolutely trying to fuck with you. She knew on conception that you AT LEAST wanted essentially goodnight text. Denied you that for nights in a row on purpose because it's 2023, you're not leaving your phone for 2 days straight and ignoring texts by mistake. Call her to make sure she's alive and she answers fist first. She was fucking waiting for it. I'm not saying shw went to New Orleans to fuck every third leg she could find walking around, but there isn't a good or rational reason to make you worry. I know you wont wanna break up or anything, but man she isnt worth it and because you care you're worth so much more. I hope you get out of there before it's too late I'm sorry cause I couldn't take that even once, that's literally begging for an issue, no matter what you better not fucking apologize or entertain the request you are a GOOD BOYFRIEND.", "This. And she might have poor object permanency x", "so you're telling me texting your bf once a day is too much demanding?\n\nseriously doesn't take much at all, if this is too much to handle then ya'll not ready for an actual relationship", "you could also send a brief apology/clarification text to her you know\n\nsomething like \"hey I realised that asking you to check in nightly could have been perceived as me monitoring when you're getting back to the hotel, or being patronising. I didn't mean it that way - I just wanted to know you were okay and having fun and in retrospect I may have handled that badly.I hope you're enjoying yourself\"\n\nup to you and you know the tenor of the relationship but I do think there's a difference between not talking by text when you're apart when nothings wrong and not talking by text when you're apart and there's been a miscommunication or a fight", "Ah, the joint chiefs of staff. They have destroyed many a stable relationship.", "She's having fun. Just have fun yourself while she's away. You get to tell stories when you see each other.", "Im not sure if that is a reasonable inference at all, people who go on vacation come home regardless of whether they live with their partner, family, roommates or alone. Thats just the common venacular for \"returning from vacation\".", "NTA. She wouldn\u2019t be my gf when she got back. Your care upset her. She doesn\u2019t like you the way you like her.", "That\u2019s not your girlfriend anymore sorry to say", "Do the same to her if you leave", "NO has one of the highest crime rates in the US, topping the murder rate at one point. NTA.", "Sounds like she wants a \"what happens in New Orleans, stays in New Orleans, well except for the communicables.\n. \"...", "NTA - her reaction is weird and I would definitely evaluate your relationship, me and my BF text each other at least once when we are just having a night out with friends (just a quick hey, you ok?) and more so if I\u2019m out (not being controlling but just wants to make sure I\u2019m ok as we live in a city with a lot of crime) to check how I\u2019m getting home, do I need picking up ect ect, he also went away for a week to watch racing and even though he was plastered the majority of the time he still let me know he was ok as I would worry if I didn\u2019t here from him like your were worried about your GF, it takes what 5 seconds to text? That\u2019s not taking time out from her fun\u2026. Again definitely NTA and weird\u2026", "NTA.\n\nWait til she gets back then talk to her.\n\nHer response was very disrespectful. If she had a problem with it (especially seeing as so many comments are telling you how dangerous New Orleans is) she should have told you straight up.\n\nPersonally I\u2019d be reevaluating the relationship, as her blasting you either shows she didn\u2019t respect you enough to tell you no beforehand, or she doesn\u2019t respect you so she felt comfortable lying to you, or she doesn\u2019t respect you and she has cheated on you in some way while in New Orleans. Neither option is good for your relationship.", "My guy just plan a trip to Vegas and give her the same energy she gives you save all text messages and she pulls any emotional srunt to make you feel bad about your trip send her the pic of the text or voice record that she said to you. Or don't up to you homie, but a wise man once told me\"2 wrongs don't make a right but sure does feel even\"", "FWIW, I dated a guy who traveled for work.  We\u2019ll call him Robert.  Robert reached out to me every morning and every evening, except when he was fucking Mary.", "She's so sketchy! OP, I think it's sweet you want to make sure your girlfriend is okay. The fact that she doesn't read your messages or ignores you for 2 days straight.\n\nShe knows what she's doing and I wouldn't trust someone who is incapable of texting me at night to let me know they are okay and safe, it doesn't take that long to do so. So why isn't she? I think there is more there on her part. When I went away anywhere I was so excited to text my then BF now husband about my trip, what I saw, what I'm doing, pics of my outfit and the drinks I drank and food I ate. My then BF now husband would do the same for me, sometimes we don't have ask each other to do so, we just do it because we care about each other.\n\nOP your GF is sketch and you are NTA", "I hated when my boyfriend would worry about me if he didn\u2019t hear from me for awhile. I actually got very annoyed the way your girlfriend did, to the point that I thought he was pathetic for being worried about me when I wasn\u2019t even thinking about it.\n\nTurns out, I actually didn\u2019t like him very much and I didn\u2019t realize I was annoyed not because he was checking up on me, but because I had to talk to him at all.\n\nMy current boyfriend is always worried about me and is constantly making sure I\u2019m not dead. It never annoys me because I ADORE him and I\u2019m so smitten by the fact that he thinks of me so much.\n\nYou might want to analyze if your GF actually likes you.\n\nNTA.", "Pack her crap up, leave it outside the door, change your locks bro. If she can't respect you enough to send an \"I'm not dead\" text she ain't the one. Your partner shouldn't intentionally make you worry", "Yes that is OTT\n\nYou want to apologise send some flowers to he hotel and leave her alone until she gets home\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to see everything she does on her social media", "NTA that\u2019s pretty thoughtful. All she has to do is text \u201cback\u201d and go to bed. She\u2019s being really weird about that.", "I hate to say this but it sounds like she\u2019s a lot less into you then you are her. I\u2019m currently away from my wife at the moment and we talk twice a day, every day. It doesn\u2019t sound like she misses you at all or cares about your feelings. If partying with her friends is more important than you, maybe you need to reassess whether you wish to stay together? \n\nIf I had to guess, her girlfriends are all single and are probably telling her to ignore you because you\u2019re too controlling. That\u2019s why they are single.", "Even after reading your comments about your normal communication style/habits, I still say NTA as NOLA can be a little sketchy, so a nightly text is not much of an ask.  And the going silent is a red flag to me.  I question who she is actually there with.", "5 months? Damn that's the most honeymoon loved up stage of a relationship and she can't be bothered to open your texts? She's out there trifling my friend. Sorry to say it but that's the general vibe I'm getting here.", "Exactly this. I hated when my ex checked up on me. I only realized once I was in a new relationship with someone I could see myself marrying and who checks up on me constantly, that I didn\u2019t hate being checked up, I hated him. Now, i still smile and get butterflies when my boyfriend calls three times in a row to make sure I\u2019m not dead because I love him so much.", "Or her girlfriends out for a girls weekend to get as much dong as they can!", "I once overheard a girl proudly said to her friends that she can think of 500 reasons why a friend's bf should \"go to hell\" (yep, that's what she literally said) because he replied \"OK\" to that friend's text. Some people just love to destroy others' relationships.", "My husband is like that too, very if you're in front of me I give you all my attention but when I'm away I give my attention to the people in with type of guy.\n\nI explained to him that even though that's the case and I love how present he is, I still would love that connection online when we are apart and guess what, he listened and would make sure to keep me included when he was away.", "When I was working 10 hour days, my lunch break and 15 minute breaks I'd be texting my boyfriend to ask how his day has been going... When you care about someone, texting them isn't a chore. Ignoring texting them and leaving them on read for 2 days however...."]}
