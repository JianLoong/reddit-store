You are working so hard, and your cousin is not pulling her weight. I cant offer much advice, so Ill just make sure to engage with this so more experienced people can give you a hand. You are working way too hard for an emotionally abusive family, you should not be the one waking up earlier to prepare a simple shake bottle, if the adults were already awake they should be doing it, heck even your cousin.", "NTA. Your family is taking advantage of you. You are being forced to be a parent, sibling, cousin and yourself at the same time. By the way your family is acting, I honestly don\u2019t know if you would be able to reason with them. I would honestly work hard, get to college like you mentioned in your comment, and do what you can to separate yourself from that toxic environment. You are not responsible for other people\u2019s choices and deserve to live your own life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Im almost near from having my own life as i am already on my last senior year, just another few months left soon ill be in college. Really appreciate your positive post man have a good day :D", "Yeah man but even if i graduate and have a job they said that i would have to pay their mortgage, which wouldn't be mine but would go to my brother instead. So i would be paying for a property that doesn't even belong to me. I can't really reason with them because they don't really listen to my side of the story so i always end up being the scapegoat for their mistakes, honestly I've been considering just being off radar and having my own life instead and not having to burden myself with other peoples responsibilities. Thank you so much for responding man, really means alot to me and helps me through the day :D", "The reason why my cousin lives with us is because her mother can't take care of her, the reason why i take care of my brother is because both of my parents have full time jobs. The reason why mad at her is because since we are the only ones left in the house, we both should work together doing chores and other stuffs. The problem is she doesn't do any of those and refuses to do so, so i end up taking all of the responsibilities at home such as cooking, babysitting and doing chores because if i do give her own set of tasks she'll report me to her mom because she doesn't want too and ill end up being scolded because of her daughter's laziness. So what i am asking to her is to give me some time to rest. I've already prepared the milk bottles, she just have to put the formula in, shake and it's done. I've already got my hands full, multitasking between being a senior high student, a parent to my younger brother, and also a caretaker to my cousin. Is it wrong to ask for a small favor just to get some rest?", "They can\u2019t force you to pay the mortgage. And don\u2019t ever let them make you think that. They can guilt you all day long, but legally you are not required to pay. Honestly, try your best to separate yourself and live your own life. You deserve that.", "I still wanna help my family even though my mom treats me like shit, my dad is alright but i still need to think about my future plans. I wanna live my life too and do what makes me happy. Thanks for the advice man, as of now my mind is a bit blurry and I can't think too clearly. Maybe I'll respond again when i finally calmed down. Thanks again man :D", "Why are you the babysitter and the maid?! \nYou should be living on your own if you can afford to, let your cousin be the babysitter.  It\u2019s not your Job to take care of the entire family, you are not the Mom!"]}
