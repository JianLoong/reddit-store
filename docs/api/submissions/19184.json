Want to make sure I represent the conversation correctly. \n\nI (late 30\u2019s F) recently bought my first home. My neighbors are a married couple around my age with four kids - 3 boys who are somewhere in the K-3rd grade (US) age range, and an older girl but she was not present in this situation. I\u2019ve had very limited interactions with them, but we would always greet each other/friendly small talk, but now that they\u2019re out of school the boys are outside a lot and are VERY interested in my pets since they do not have any of their own. \n\nOne of my dogs, we will call her Pancake, is a pitbull I recently rescued who had been used for breeding for several years. She is the sweetest girl in the world, but she has very evident signs of physical trauma. She has chronically swollen mammary glands, vaginal prolapse and hyperplasia which causes a dark, swollen, oddly shaped, very prominent vulva. She is now fixed, and I promise she sees a vet regularly to closely monitor these conditions, but she is doing great. \n\nSoon after I brought her home the 3 boys all ran over to meet her when we were walking. Conversation went something like this. I don\u2019t recall which kid asked what exactly:\n\nKid: What\u2019s wrong with her?\n\nMe: Nothing is wrong with her! This is Pancake and she is a very good girl and would love for you to pet her!\n\nKid: Why does her stomach look like that?\n\nMe: Well, she came from a situation where people weren\u2019t very nice to her and she was used for breeding for many years. \n\nKid: What\u2019s breeding?\n\nMe: It\u2019s when someone forces a girl dog like Pancake to have puppies so they can sell them. It\u2019s not always very nice and can sometimes hurt the mom dog. \n\n\u2014Kid\u2019s Mom starts to walk over, definitely within earshot\u2014 \n\nKid: How many puppies did she have?\n\nMe: I don\u2019t know exactly, but probably 60 or 70. \n\nKid: She looks like a cow.\n\nMe: I can see why you think that. Those are her teats. It\u2019s how she fed all of her babies. They\u2019re just a little bit larger than you may be used to seeing on other dogs because she had so many babies and wasn\u2019t always allowed to have proper time to recover. \n\nKid: What\u2019s on her butt? Is she pooping? (Lots of laughing.) \n\nMe: No, she is not pooping. That is her vulva. That is where all her puppies came out. It\u2019s \u2014 (cut off by mom)\n\nMom: Seriously? These are children! What is wrong with you?\n\n\u2014Mom calls her boys to go inside\u2014\n\nSince this incident, the Mom has actively prevented the boys from coming over to see my dogs or talk to me, and has completely ignored my existence. \n\nI\u2019m not super hurt by this (although Pancake is), but I also don\u2019t think I really did anything wrong. That said, I do not have children. I\u2019m not really close to anyone with children, so I have limited to no experience around them.\n\nSo, AITA for how I responded to their questions? Is there a more kid friendly term for vulva I should be aware of in case I\u2019m faced with a similar situation in the future?\n\nEdited for formatting.

It makes me angry and disgusting when I hear it. The clit and vagina is not a cookie.  Can you imagine a little girl being asked it she wants a cookie to eat?

It was just answering their questions with facts.\n\nOn the other hand, not every question a child asks a stranger really needs answered. I think the respectful thing to do is to direct those questions back to their parents, who have already decided how they want to approach discussing things like sex and anatomy. Kind of like if a kid asks you where Christmas presents come from, it's not really your place to decide they're ready for that truth knowing full well their parents may be doing the Santa thing for now. Sure, it's just a fact. But you're not their parent or their teacher.\n\nNext time, maybe just filter your words a little bit more. It's okay to redirect or dodge those questions with something like, \"That's just part of her body, and all dog bodies look different just like ours. If you wanna learn more about dogs, I bet your mom knows a lot.\"", "I'm going to go with a soft YTA here.  Nothing you said was wrong and I think you said it well and I have no objection to your terminology, but still that is all just... *a lot* to tell kids that aren't yours, and not just the medical piece; you haven't considered that maybr mom was mad because the whole story is just traumatic and that needed context, especially for empathic kids.  I've raised my kids with casual use of accurate words for genitalia and reproduction, and I'd still be annoyed about this, not because of the word vulva but because of the cruelty aspect.  My daughter was the type who would have spent weeks waking up screaming from nightmares that someone forced her to have 70 babies with vivid visuals courtesy of Pancake (the real victim here and a good girl).  And every time she did I'd be mentally wishing for the fleas of a thousand camels to infest your armpits.  And that's kinda why you don't have conversations of this sort with not-your kids.  Sure, it's part of life and needs to be addressed, yes, but it sucks for us parents when strangers drop it and dip and leave us with the fallout.", "A soft YTA. \n\nThere\u2019s so many ways to answer that is appropriate for kids that age that AREN\u2019T yours. \n\nIn my family I learned the right names early and so did my kids. \n\nBut you could just say \u201cher body has some issues from what she went through.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s nothing WRONG with what you did but that doesn\u2019t make it RIGHT either. You took a choice to expose other people\u2019s kids to some knowledge that perhaps they weren\u2019t ready to share.", "YTA - no private body part talk with little ones without their parent present.\n\nYou really have to ask if that\u2019s an okay thing?", "Poor Pancake!\n\nI'm a big believer in telling kids the truth and using correct names for parts of the anatomy.  But these were someone else's kids and you seem very unclear about how young the yougest ones were  Kindergarten age would be 5 years old.  So it's entirely possible that one or more of these kids doesn't have any idea where babies (or puppies) come from.\n\nGiven this likelihood, it would have been wise for you to tell them that poor Pancake's body got hurt and then refer them to their parents for further explanation.  \n\nSo pleased that you rescued this dog but gentle YTA on explaining what being a breeder dog means to tiny children who might have no idea about procreation in general.", "INFO\n\n> Kid: What\u2019s wrong with her?\n\n> Me: Nothing is wrong with her!\n\nBut didn't you just say:\n\n> She has chronically swollen mammary glands, vaginal prolapse and hyperplasia which causes a dark, swollen, oddly shaped, very prominent vulva.\n\n*That's* what's wrong with her, right?", "Nta. I was prepared to see you called the dog a b***h, which would've been unnecessary", "Very soft YTA. My girls are 6 and 9. Sometimes they ask questions, and while I always try to be honest with them, they're too young to hear some things. \n\nI would have just said that the dog was hurt be previous owners, that it has left marks and just so. And if the mom was nearby, maybe explain to her privately so that she could see what she was ready to explain to her kids.\n\nKids that age are curious but sometimes don't really care for a detailed answer, i'll often lose mines' interest if I explain something too lengthy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They prefer to keep them in ignorance, especially if they're relying on that for things like religious indoctrination.\n\nYou're NTA for talking honestly about your pupper or for trying to educate children in a respectful and medically accurate manner.\n\nYou're doing a good thing, taking in a pet that has been through a lot. Give her head scratches from me, please!", "NTA. It's a vulva, you called it a vulva. I have literally taught that term to kindergarten children - it's part of the Child Protection curriculum where I live (NSW, Australia) that children learn the correct names for male and female genitalia. Her children will survive.", "NTA \n\nYour neighbors are prudely uncomfortable, now you know. Imho - good luck to those boys! And their poor daughter. \n\nI have a close friend raised like that, he had to ask (whisper) a lot of the questions to me during health class when we got to female reproduction. He was a bit embarrassed he thought the period was a 2-3h toilet stop. Sad world but that\u2019s how it goes.\n\nOn the flip side many parents our generation (like me) do use the real names. It freaks people out my kid says penis, but so be it. I\u2019m sure their doctor says it too, not our problem they blush. Better we face the discomfort than our kids imho, they need to be educated and the body normalised.", "NTA.  It\u2019s unfortunate some parents believe people are being vulgar when stating the anatomical parts.  Good luck to you and Pancake!", "Thenkyou for rescuing Pancake you are an earth angel. And kids should be taught the correct terminology for bodily parts.", "YTA. Americans are prudes, I agree. But those weren\u2019t your kids, and you admitted that they\u2019re basically strangers. I think it\u2019s important to not stigmatize body parts, but it wasn\u2019t your place to do that. I don\u2019t think you meant to do anything wrong, but you did cross a boundary. \n\nEdit: you could have just said that her private parts were hurt from having too many puppies. If the mom still had a problem with it, she needs to teach her kids to not speak to strangers.", "Not the AH and avoid that mom\u2026 She sounds very not clever\u2026", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re using anatomical terms to answer kids\u2019s questions. If they\u2019re old enough to ask the questions, they are old enough to hear the age-appropriate answer. A 5 to 9 year old kid is old enough to understand anatomically correct terms like vulva.", "That mum isnt gonna tell her kids how babies are made then when the kid get married and does the deed he is probs gonna ask her how it all happens", "NTA.  Sounds like the mom doesn't want to admit her kids are growing up.  If they are old enough to ask the questions, they're old enough for the answer.\n\nNext time she says something about your use of proper terminology ask her what she would have used instead.  Then watch her stutter.", "What?! How dare you explain where puppies come from and how dog life works!!! Disgusting and completely inappropriate\n\n/S NTA.", "NTA, you explained it very well.", "NTA and for what it's worth as a father of two young boys and one teenage boy I respect your approach and I wish people would treat situations like this the way you did more often.", "NTA at all.  Don't let any of these parents tell you any different.  Thinking the world needs to adjust to your child's needs or demands is about the most ridiculous thing one could imagine expecting.  Then again, that's why so we have so many messed up kids, because the parents are even worse.  You answered straightforward, respect to you.", "\nNTA.\n\nAnd here i was thinking you were calling your dog the correct name for a female dog....\nThe thing is - a lot of professionals say to use the correct names for things as it's a prevention to the kids being potentially abused.\nIt's parts of the body! Body parts have correct names. The way you spoke to the kids was age appropriate and educational, and correct. \nSounds like their mum needs an education on what parts of the body are called.", "I have kids and I think you did an awesome job explaining everything.  You didn\u2019t tell them how she got pregnant or how the babies were born.  You simply said that is where the babies come out and it is called a vulva.  It may have gotten to some iffy conversation when they ask how she got pregnant and wanted details.  That would have been the time ti send them home and have them ask their parents.  But you described it well and at a level that they could understand.  I m very impressed with your explanation.  So no you are no the ah.  NTA", "I\u2019m super open with my daughter and still would have been a little irritated that you spoke to her about this. Next time just tell kids to ask their mom.", "NTA. They asked, you answered in a normal way. Nothing too explicit, nothing weird, normal words. This is common biology and it is a shame that in 2023 there are still parents who are so uptight and prudish that they react like this.\n\nINFO though: I'm not from the USA, but am I correct that the boys are somewhere between 4 and 10 years old?", "NTA, I think vulva is about as clean a terminology you could have chosen", "NAH. But I don't think you should have redirected the conversation, I don't think having a conversation with someone else's kids how your dog was forcefully bred and because of that she has the medical issues that she has isn't really appropriate to take on with kids you don't really know. But I don't think that makes you an AH.\n\nYou used proper terms and you weren't vulgar but I can understand why your neighbor was upset.", "NTA in anyway. I\u2019m sad these children came out of her bajingo", ">K-3rd grade (US) age range  \n\n\nwhy wouldn\u2019t you use ages so nobody outside the US knows how old they are?", "NAH. I understand why you want to use proper terms, but I also understand why the Mom was upset. I try to tailor my response to my audience, usually teats is going to be fine for everyone, but vulva might be a bit much for a 5 year old. I stick with lady bits, and as they grow you can get more specific.  \n\nI had to field some awkward questions when our neighbor's kids saw my goats mating. Personally, I would have told them in kid friendly terms what was happening, but, I am not their parent, and their mother chose to not quite explain the situation and say it was something else. Again, not what I would have done, but I can see her not wanting to get into that with a 3 and 5 year old.", "NTA.\n\nVulva is a normal words. Idk why some people are so strict on woman body part (I\u2019m not in US so I assure you it happens everywhere). Let\u2019s be real this 3 boys are know that they have a penis, and they call it as such.", "NTA. It\u2019s important for children to learn about biology (animas and humans) and quite frankly I don\u2019t understand why so many people are scared to talk about sex and puberty and the male and female body from a factual perspective. I feel like the ones who are so freaked out by talking to kids about these things in a afcatual manner are freaked out because they sexualise these things and can\u2019t separate that from the neutrality of anatomy and facts of life.", "YTA, not for the terminology. There's nothing wrong with using appropriate wording for body parts. Where you went wrong was explaining the horrors of dog breeding to very young children without the parent's consent. Children that age barely understand birth, let alone forced reproduction. I know you mean well, but next time just leave it at \"she was in a very bad place\". Kids don't need to know that she was forced to birth several puppies that were taken away from her.", "NAH. Look, I think it's important for kids to use the right words - I tell my 10 month old I am cleaning her vulva. But it's still not *super* common and lots of people view it the same as telling kids about sex. You may disagree, but it's their kids so they get to decide. If you want to keep your friendly relationship with your neighbours I think you should apologise.", "NTA. It's important for children to know and use the proper names for body parts.", "Took me a second to understand that the terminology issue was with vulva. It\u2019s the word, why would that be a problem? I don\u2019t get US issues. I am not even sure if I am capable to vote for this one but NTA in my humble opinion.", "NTA - I think you explained it wonderfully, not inappropriately at all.", "And it\u2019s a real shame because there\u2019s many times that this lack of proper terminology can hurt kids too! If they\u2019re being abused sexually, they literally don\u2019t have the words to tell someone that something bad is happening. It\u2019s REALLY important to use the correct words with kids", "I knew a woman who taught her toddler daughters to call it their \u201csugar bowl\u201d. \ud83d\ude44", "And that is why CPS offices have a going list of \"cutesy\" genital names because kids don't know the real names.", "You gave clear straight forward answers, and it was the mother that was weird and uptight.", "The name might not be the problem, the problem might be telling kindergarteners how babies are born without talking to the mom first. I've always used anatomically correct terms with my daughter, but I haven't told her about the birds and the bees yet and that's a parent's prerogative", "I hate the word \"vajayjay\" with a fiery passion and thought I was the only one.", "Oh my god. I use both of those terms hahah. But I also have a toddler who knows the proper terms for her genitalia and won't be learning the silly ones from us. Sorry that we can't be friends, though.", "I think words like vajayjay is hilarious if used in a humorous sense among adults, for example when telling a funny story. But I'm not a fan of teaching kids those words instead of the actual words.", "The one word that makes me cringe is titties.  So juvenile.  It's embarrassing hearing adults use it.\nOP handled the questions just how I'd like my kids curiousity answered.\nNTA.", "My sister is 31 and has a first aid qualification in which she had to study biology and the proper terms for everything and for some reason she still finds it difficult to use the proper terms. She'll still use \"fanny\", \"vajayjay\", \"guy's thing\" or \"equipment\". She'll always pause and whisper the words as well. Just say the proper terms, you won't be struck down by lightning for saying vagina or penis", "Apropos of clinical, when I was thirteen I was reading *The Godfather*, and I came across a word I didn't know.  So, I asked my mother, \"Mum, what's fellatio?\"  With a shocked, horrified, and disgusted face, she said \"It's a yucky kind of sex.\"\n\nSince that in no way explained things to me, I went to ask my father the same question.  His first question was, \"What are you reading?\"  Then he calmly and quite matter-of-factly told me that fellatio was the proper terminology for performing oral sex on a male.   I was like \"Oh, okay, whatever.  Just didn't know the word.\"\n\nThe difference in the two responses I got was jarring.", "Agreed. I'm exactly like your daughter. Finding out at that age that having too many babies can cause your organs to start falling out would've distressed me SO MUCH. Like, I would've shut down for a week.", "I agree that the cruelty aspect is much more important. I wouldn't call OP an asshole, but if these kids were sensitive, they might have nightmares about this. Not to say that they should not have the information, but the might need to hear it in a specific way.", "Puritan about discussing in detail forced birth? To strangers?", "I agree with everything you said except the judgement. I think the mom is TA for objecting specifically once the word \"vulva\" came up, rather than earlier when OP was telling the kids details about how the dog was mistreated that might have been too much for them.\n\nI do think it was a mistake for OP to be so specific, but the general principle of being honest with kids is a good one. OP overshot the mark, but she doesn't have a lot of experience with kids and she had just adopted Pancake, so she hadn't had time to perfect her explanation yet.\n\nBut yeah, OP, next time go with vague and redirect!", ">they\u2019re like 7 years old and younger.\n\nThanks for deciphering 'K-3 grade (US)' for the many of us who have absolutely no bloomin' idea what that is.\n\nWhy do so many Americans give a 'such and such school grade' instead of a number years for age. Age is how many years someone has lived. That's universal. School grades are different in every country. \nI don't even know how to work out age from school grade in the country I live in, because I didn't go to school here.", "That wasn't age appropriate, the details about the abuse. YTA", "My mother whispers \u201cvulgar\u201d words when they have to be spoken about. I like to feign deafness and say, \u201cwhat!? Menopause?! Speak up!\u201d \n\nAnd yes, my mother thinks menopause is a vulgar word, sex, breasts, cancer, period, gynecologist, all make the cut too.", " I could probably never be friends with anyone who used a term like \"junk\" or \"vajayjay.", "Honestly, that\u2019s 10x worse than the term.", "Ew, that just made me gag", "Surely a 3rd grader would know? Even more so, a 3rd grader with an older sister and who had experienced his mother being pregnant twice? Kids ask from very young age where babies come from. What do you tell them then, if not the truth? OP is absolutely NTA for assuming they knew, or telling them where animal's babies come from. She didn't even mention human babies.", "that's a good point, although I think there's a pretty big difference between explaining how babies are born vs how babies are made. it sounds OP was pretty clearly talking about just about the birthing process, but maybe the kids mom thought the conversation was heading toward a sex-ed type discussion? \n\neither way, OPs still NTA, but maybe the mom was also just mistaken and overprotective, rather TA.", "The removing confusion is so very important for being able to report for children!\n\nRead a story a year or two ago about safeguarding in schools and how proper names for parts were important. A wee one had gone to school and told their teacher about their \u201cuncle touching their cookie\u201d. The teacher thought nothing of it until weeks later at a parent teacher conference and the mom said something in passing about cookie. It was only then that the teacher was able to understand what the little one had tried to tell her and so the incident was able to be reported.", "Could also be helpful in a medical sense: you can describe and research symptoms better and be more likely to receive a proper diagnosis.", "You are not alone!

My daughter always knew she was in my belly (and when we see pregnant people she knows that there's a baby in there). When she was 2, she asked how she came out? \"Through my vagina\". That's a fact, and there's nothing dirty about that. Why hide it?", "The kids have 4 siblings and they don't know where babies come from? I wonder if they are homeschooling them and saying they were brought by the stork.", "Utter vulgarity!", "This is not at all uncommon. Even kids who understand that their mom was pregnant and had a baby don\u2019t all understand the mechanics of how the baby got from point A to point B. Their mom simply might have felt it was info better coming from *her* and in the way she felt they would receive it best. Not every kid processes information the same way.
