Want to make sure I represent the conversation correctly. \n\nI (late 30\u2019s F) recently bought my first home. My neighbors are a married couple around my age with four kids - 3 boys who are somewhere in the K-3rd grade (US) age range, and an older girl but she was not present in this situation. I\u2019ve had very limited interactions with them, but we would always greet each other/friendly small talk, but now that they\u2019re out of school the boys are outside a lot and are VERY interested in my pets since they do not have any of their own. \n\nOne of my dogs, we will call her Pancake, is a pitbull I recently rescued who had been used for breeding for several years. She is the sweetest girl in the world, but she has very evident signs of physical trauma. She has chronically swollen mammary glands, vaginal prolapse and hyperplasia which causes a dark, swollen, oddly shaped, very prominent vulva. She is now fixed, and I promise she sees a vet regularly to closely monitor these conditions, but she is doing great. \n\nSoon after I brought her home the 3 boys all ran over to meet her when we were walking. Conversation went something like this. I don\u2019t recall which kid asked what exactly:\n\nKid: What\u2019s wrong with her?\n\nMe: Nothing is wrong with her! This is Pancake and she is a very good girl and would love for you to pet her!\n\nKid: Why does her stomach look like that?\n\nMe: Well, she came from a situation where people weren\u2019t very nice to her and she was used for breeding for many years. \n\nKid: What\u2019s breeding?\n\nMe: It\u2019s when someone forces a girl dog like Pancake to have puppies so they can sell them. It\u2019s not always very nice and can sometimes hurt the mom dog. \n\n\u2014Kid\u2019s Mom starts to walk over, definitely within earshot\u2014 \n\nKid: How many puppies did she have?\n\nMe: I don\u2019t know exactly, but probably 60 or 70. \n\nKid: She looks like a cow.\n\nMe: I can see why you think that. Those are her teats. It\u2019s how she fed all of her babies. They\u2019re just a little bit larger than you may be used to seeing on other dogs because she had so many babies and wasn\u2019t always allowed to have proper time to recover. \n\nKid: What\u2019s on her butt? Is she pooping? (Lots of laughing.) \n\nMe: No, she is not pooping. That is her vulva. That is where all her puppies came out. It\u2019s \u2014 (cut off by mom)\n\nMom: Seriously? These are children! What is wrong with you?\n\n\u2014Mom calls her boys to go inside\u2014\n\nSince this incident, the Mom has actively prevented the boys from coming over to see my dogs or talk to me, and has completely ignored my existence. \n\nI\u2019m not super hurt by this (although Pancake is), but I also don\u2019t think I really did anything wrong. That said, I do not have children. I\u2019m not really close to anyone with children, so I have limited to no experience around them.\n\nSo, AITA for how I responded to their questions? Is there a more kid friendly term for vulva I should be aware of in case I\u2019m faced with a similar situation in the future?\n\nEdited for formatting.

It makes me angry and disgusting when I hear it. The clit and vagina is not a cookie.  Can you imagine a little girl being asked it she wants a cookie to eat?

Just a smidgen of asshole. \n\nOn one hand, you didn't say anything wrong. It wasn't raunchy or provocative. It was just answering their questions with facts.\n\nOn the other hand, not every question a child asks a stranger really needs answered. I think the respectful thing to do is to direct those questions back to their parents, who have already decided how they want to approach discussing things like sex and anatomy. Kind of like if a kid asks you where Christmas presents come from, it's not really your place to decide they're ready for that truth knowing full well their parents may be doing the Santa thing for now. Sure, it's just a fact. But you're not their parent or their teacher.\n\nNext time, maybe just filter your words a little bit more. It's okay to redirect or dodge those questions with something like, \"That's just part of her body, and all dog bodies look different just like ours. If you wanna learn more about dogs, I bet your mom knows a lot.\"", "I'm going to go with a soft YTA here.  Nothing you said was wrong and I think you said it well and I have no objection to your terminology, but still that is all just... *a lot* to tell kids that aren't yours, and not just the medical piece; you haven't considered that maybr mom was mad because the whole story is just traumatic and that needed context, especially for empathic kids.  I've raised my kids with casual use of accurate words for genitalia and reproduction, and I'd still be annoyed about this, not because of the word vulva but because of the cruelty aspect.  My daughter was the type who would have spent weeks waking up screaming from nightmares that someone forced her to have 70 babies with vivid visuals courtesy of Pancake (the real victim here and a good girl).  And every time she did I'd be mentally wishing for the fleas of a thousand camels to infest your armpits.  And that's kinda why you don't have conversations of this sort with not-your kids.  Sure, it's part of life and needs to be addressed, yes, but it sucks for us parents when strangers drop it and dip and leave us with the fallout.", "A soft YTA. \n\nThere\u2019s so many ways to answer that is appropriate for kids that age that AREN\u2019T yours. \n\nIn my family I learned the right names early and so did my kids. \n\nBut you could just say \u201cher body has some issues from what she went through.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s nothing WRONG with what you did but that doesn\u2019t make it RIGHT either. You took a choice to expose other people\u2019s kids to some knowledge that perhaps they weren\u2019t ready to share.", "YTA - no private body part talk with little ones without their parent present.\n\nYou really have to ask if that\u2019s an okay thing?", "Poor Pancake!\n\nI'm a big believer in telling kids the truth and using correct names for parts of the anatomy.  But these were someone else's kids and you seem very unclear about how young the yougest ones were  Kindergarten age would be 5 years old.  So it's entirely possible that one or more of these kids doesn't have any idea where babies (or puppies) come from.\n\nGiven this likelihood, it would have been wise for you to tell them that poor Pancake's body got hurt and then refer them to their parents for further explanation.  \n\nSo pleased that you rescued this dog but gentle YTA on explaining what being a breeder dog means to tiny children who might have no idea about procreation in general.", "INFO\n\n> Kid: What\u2019s wrong with her?\n\n> Me: Nothing is wrong with her!\n\nBut didn't you just say:\n\n> She has chronically swollen mammary glands, vaginal prolapse and hyperplasia which causes a dark, swollen, oddly shaped, very prominent vulva.\n\n*That's* what's wrong with her, right?", "Nta. I was prepared to see you called the dog a b***h, which would've been unnecessary", "Very soft YTA. My girls are 6 and 9. Sometimes they ask questions, and while I always try to be honest with them, they're too young to hear some things. \n\nI would have just said that the dog was hurt be previous owners, that it has left marks and just so. And if the mom was nearby, maybe explain to her privately so that she could see what she was ready to explain to her kids.\n\nKids that age are curious but sometimes don't really care for a detailed answer, i'll often lose mines' interest if I explain something too lengthy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
