Some have it set at 21, others have it set at 16 or younger.  I argue that there may even be some 25-30 year old's that lack maturity to make good decisions. There has to be a common standard set. At 18 one has (usually) graduated high school and possibly is employed. But still may be receiving appropriate guidance. Some 16 year old kids may make better choices than their 40 year old parents. But in a case where you see your child is OBVIOUSLY not making mature and appropriate decisions you must be a parent and guide them accordingly. Stuffing kids into a bubble and not allowing them to live and learn to make good choices is detrimental. There are appropriate milestones that we reach at varying points in our maturity.

Validate her frustration (honestly I'd be frustrated with every single aspect of a private school with uniforms) and try to actually problem solve instead of a blanket rule that limits her even more.", "> The brain isn't even fully developed until the mid 20's.\n\nI'm so sick of this. It's become the latest trendy mantra for people dehumanizing kids. \n\nIs it technically true? Sure, perhaps. It doesn't mean a teenager is some half-braindead wild animal or something, like some people seem to make out. They still know what's comfortable and know how to feel embarrassed. I'm sure you remember being 14. Do you remember being some sort of incomplete proto-human? Or did you feel like a real person, with real feelings and opinions?", "Having had uniform shirts ordered after a supplier change the sizes don't always line up. I ordered some shirts and checked the sizing charts, depending on the cut I was a small, a large, and an XL. I ordered the shirt where I was a small and the shirt I was an XL they both fit exactly the same in the length and the sleeves. One was more snug across the body because that was how it was cut and meant to fit.", "You can't call this one unless you know how the shirt fits her. Was she wearing a shirt so small it was essentially a crop top? Because then 2 sizes might make sense. This is an info, how well does the new shirt fit? Is it baggy on her? If it is, then OP is the AH. If it fits, then OP isn't the AH. \n\nYou can't use your own anecdotal evidence. My mom did that to me too, once buying me pants so large my husband and I could both wear them at the same time. But you can't judge everyone like their intentions are evil without proof.", "Did you miss the part that said it was the recommended size for her height and weight? Sounds like daughter wants skin tight and mom wants appropriate.", "She ordered the size recommended on the size chart.", "My mum would do this i was often in clothes 2/3 sizes too big for me definitely destroyed my confidence i looked lot bigger then I was. I remember going shopping with my mum and picked out a top that I liked and it did actually fit me but my mum made me keep trying on the next size up till I went from size 8 to 14 and you could no longer see any shape of my body. Might aswell have just worn a sack.", "\"Ooh, the large is a little snug. 2XL for you!\"\n\nAt least it was only two sizes. I was gifted a 4XL shirt when I could comfortably fit XL (L was too tight, although I didn't want to admit it).\n\nYTA, OP.", "But the size she wanted was too small", ">(which was also the size recommended for her height and weight on the list) \n\nShe was already wearing something too small. She got something possibly slightly loose. She'll be fine.", "The OP went off the size chart. If it's a different shirt than the old one, that might contribute to the two size difference. (E.g. sometimes you are a medium in one shirt, large in another).", "One of the frustrating things about shopping as a woman.\n\nI have two pairs of jeans from the same company. Same cut, same size- only difference is one is light colored and the the other is dark. The lighter pair fit fine but I can\u2019t button the darker pair. Bought them both in store at the same time. Absolutely irritating", "Yeah and at 14 a girl might not grow anymore. I bought some clothes at that age that I really liked but were too big, thinking I\u2019d grow into them - I never got any bigger.", "Yup. My school shirts were always big and boxy on me while every other girl had them tailored. I tried to sew them myself but they never looked right and it was embarrassing and made me pretty self conscious. Teenage girls are mean and judgmental. And even when they aren't, being a teenage girl fitting in is hard enough as is.", "Yep. My mom always got me medium+large clothes stating that i would grow into them. But here i am, still a small at 24. I was alway so self conscious about how baggy everything was on me.", "That's rough. I'm glad your mum made the effort though. \n\nI was a fat kid and sometimes my clothes didn't fit right. But I was brought up by a mother who thought that if you could squeeze into a smaller size that was a good thing???", "When I was like like 12, we went on a trip and I wanted a sweater. It was in men's sizes so I wanted it in a small, but my mom forced me to get it in a medium. The medium was big enough to put my knees up under it. I was an adult by the time it fit in a flattering way, but I obviously no longer cared for it... I was 12, the points was to show off to my classmates that I went on a trip and to look cute (it's not a very profound point, but I was 12). My mom's argument was that I was going to grow into it...", "Because the size chart recommendations are the epitome of cool for ever body type... get the clothes tailored if it will make your daughter feel more comfortable.  2 sizes bigger than 1 size too small is embarrassing as a kid.", "I have five pairs of jeans. From three different manufacturers. They all fit fine in terms of waist/butt though not length (I am short). \n\nAnd range in size from 6 to 12. Funny, the petite ones are still too long. \n\nWomen's clothing sizes are demented.", "Same exact thing happened to me! I stopped growing at 13\u2026never got that party for reaching 5\u2019 that my friends promised me lmao", "I always just saw myself as fat, but really I just got tits before everyone else and couldn\u2019t wear a small or xsmall like my friends. Big boobs are not fun for a kid", "She got her the recommended size, calm down.", "I\u2019m 5\u20191 and most petite will fit in length but not the waist/thighs. 12/14 usually fits. Mostly.\n\nOld Navy has been good to me recently with some of their stretchier jeans- the flares I bought not long ago fit pretty well", "Those things are not always accurate.", "5 foot 3, and I have one petite pair the right length, one too short (I wear with boots lol) one that I turn up cuffs on.\n\nI will say it has gotten much better as I aged, when I was young I had a 22 inch waist and 34 inch hips. So any pants I could pull up all the way generally had a bunch of extra material around the waist. \n\nI envy hubby. He can grab any pair of 36w/34l pants and they fit great.", "They're definitely not accurate when it comes to teen girl sizing because manufacturers ignore the fact they have breasts. The \"recommended\" size never fit me because they never had the proper darts to fit around my bust."]}
