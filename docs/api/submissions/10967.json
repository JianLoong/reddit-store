Some have it set at 21, others have it set at 16 or younger.  I argue that there may even be some 25-30 year old's that lack maturity to make good decisions. There has to be a common standard set. At 18 one has (usually) graduated high school and possibly is employed. But still may be receiving appropriate guidance. Some 16 year old kids may make better choices than their 40 year old parents. But in a case where you see your child is OBVIOUSLY not making mature and appropriate decisions you must be a parent and guide them accordingly. Stuffing kids into a bubble and not allowing them to live and learn to make good choices is detrimental. There are appropriate milestones that we reach at varying points in our maturity.

Also one size is a huge difference. A size small looks pretty normal on me, but a size medium looks really bad, and makes me look like a teenage boy IMO, and I feel so unconfident in it. When I gained weight I think it took about 30-40 pounds to shift my shirt size up by one size if we are talking XS, S, M, L, etc or about 10-15 pounds for every size meaning from a 2 to a 4, 4 to a 6, etc. If she fits into one size but it's a little tight, 2 sizes up (or 4 dress sizes) is going to be about 3 dress sizes too big and may look very baggy.", "Yta", "nta, especially since shes 14, kids grow quiick. shes gonna need a new shirt by the end of the semester anyway.", "YTA.

Mom is in charge of properly clothing her child, and that's what she did. Daughter doesn't need hand holding about it.

I think regardless going up in size can be hard and make a kid feel self-conscious so I\u2019d imagine some push back regardless.

That\u2019s not abnormal for a kid her age. But neither is the expectation that she needs to follow the dress code. You aren\u2019t a bad parent for enforcing that.", "NTA.  Schools have dress codes for a reason.  It's not a runway model school to have boys looking them up and down, but a school that wants everyone modest and that includes not have shirts hug your body.  You're going by school policy.  I think you should sit down with her and go through the handbook with her because she's clearly going to not let this rest unless she sees it in print.  If she's still insistent, then it'd be something that should be discussed with school admin and see what their views are, and what you'd tell your daughter that you'd be doing.  If they'll give you both the okay for a shirt one size down, great, however, until you do speak with the administration, going by school policy is what should happen.  It's not irrational, wearing a slightly less baggy shirt, unlike, say, trying to fight back against dying one's hair 50 different colours if not allowed, but unless it's been cleared, going by the book is, unfortunately, what has to happen.", "Also, at that age I was kind of in denial about what size I wore, and would try to squeeze into clothes that were too small because I liked them and didn't want to go up a size. But this isn't good if it's going to get someone in trouble.", "Also it sounds like OP was more concerned about their own convenience. It's easier for them to go without daughter, but when it was obvious that the first shirt didn't fight they should have spent the extra time to take daughter alone and try them on at the shop to make sure whatever's bought fit properly.", "My mom always said, people can't see the size on the tag but they can see how something fits you", "I don't think this is the issue. She just doesn't want to to wear baggy clothes.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s actually too big. She just wants it to fit more tightly. Maybe he can agree to get it tailored for her so it has the correct length and is a little more fitted so it looks nice.", "As a woman I can fully attest that I still grew until I was 21. Height may be attained early but the rest of our bodies are absolutely still developing past 14.", "Not me, I was 5\u2019 and a 34 DD weighing 105 by 14. Stopped growing in all directions (lol). I was still 5\u2019 and a 34 DD weighing 107 at 24. \n\nThen a health issue caused massive weight gain starting when I was in my early 30s and while I\u2019ve now lost much of it, my chest is smaller (mostly on one side \ud83d\ude2d) and I\u2019ll never see a weight that low again.", "The trendy phrases is \u201cdehumanizing kids\u201d. There is a practice called \u201cFair Practiced\u201d.  Where the boss will ask for input from employees, the boss will take these opinions in to account.  However at the end of the day, the boss makes the final say.  Parenting is like this.  You get your child\u2019s input, but the final say is the parents.", "Yeah, but the clothing mentioned doesn't sound \"baggy\". If anything, it sounds like the size the mom got fits her just right, and the previous one was too small/revealing.", "My daughter went from a c cup to a g cup in 3 months while I was in hospital. My poor boyfriend took her bra shopping several times.", "So if it actually fits and isn\u2019t baggy then NTA. It sounds like she wanted the smallest possible size she could squeeze into.", "The shirt was fitting OP\u2019s daughter like a crop top and was two years old. If the girl was wearing at 12 I was wearing a smaller size than i was at 14, so think about it in terms of how long ago that two-sizes-smaller shirt was bought.", "If it's 2 sizes up and not fitted then it's baggy or I'll give you loose fitting but I don't think the issue is the actual size vs the fit like I said.", "I grew 6 inches between 15 and 16. I think my poor parents were just ready to give up after the third time they had to replace all my pants.", "Try being the teenager that can't stop eating, plowing through food like I was inhaling air, and yet still losing weight(some was loss, some was just stretching up like a rubber band) with a mom who was convinced she couldn't watch a Burger King commercial without gaining.", "I agree. Where I am students from elementary thru middle school wear blue or white polos with jeans and the girls can wear skirts of a certain length.\n\nWhen my stepdaughter was in middle school, I got her the shirts from 'the big box store' but let her choose the jeans and other non-school stuff within reason from other stores.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the uniforms was that rich and poor kids could be more equal. But the kids used the brand of jeans and shirts to get around that.\n\nSo anytime her grandmother (who isn't hurting for money) took her shopping, they'd get $30 shirts instead of the $5 shirts lol.\n\nIt was funny because even many of the richer kids got Walmart shirts and not so expensive jeans. But those who cared about such things REALLY cared, which defeated the purpose of the uniforms.", "I got my first period at 13. As I stated in another comment, I grew 6 inches between the ages of 15 and 16. I only know a couple of women who stopped growing at 13 or 14.", "What?", "That is just not true. Girls are going into puberty much earlier than they used to. Most 10 year old girls, or 12 (I think that's the median start age of puberty for girls now) are not done growing yet.\n\nAnecdotally:\n\nI started puberty at 11, and I quit growing at 16. I jumped from a kid's like size 6 to a \"plus size 1x\" (which is roughly size 14-16), which is a ton of sizes. My cousin stopped growing at 15, my sister at 15, too. I don't have a single female friend who was done growing when they got their period. Almost all of us had 3-4 more years of growth, only 1 friend I know quit growing within a year of her first period.\n\nThe parent will know their kids growth pattern enough to be able to gauge whether the extra size is ridiculous or not.", "Back when I was maybe... 25? I found in our barn the bike my parents gave me for my 13th birthday. I have up trying to ride it after a few days because it was too big. \n\nI still couldn't ride it. It was still too big! \n\nRealizing you haven't grown (height wise anyway \ud83d\ude06) since the age of 13 is a sobering experience.", "And as we all know, teenagers are *so* thrilled when we get out the tape measure! /s", "A generation ago, the \"rule\" was that a girl would grow two inches in the six months after her first period.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true - or maybe just not universal - that those who stop growing by that age must be small busted. By 14, I was done growing taller by a good year or two. I\u2019m short but I was wearing a 34 DD bra at that age, still weighing about 105 pounds. \n\nMy wife was done growing by about 10, probably earlier. She was 5\u2019 tall in early elementary school and had both breasts AND her period by age 8; she was certainly not flat-chested at 14. \n\nAs a large-chested girl, oversized shirts made me look heavier and were a reason for bullying, so I would be very upset if OP had done that to me at that age. One size up, sure, but 2? That seems unnecessary.", "Just reading that made me feel bad for her", "I was wearing a C cup when I was 13 in 9th grade, and an E cup at 16 in senior. It felt like an almost geometric rate! I'd have happily subtracted inches off my bust to add to my dinky height! (Still would, honestly.)", "Yup I went from B to E in a school year.", "I know teens can grow quite quickly, but it's still super weird that she apparently ended up with 8 breasts.\n\n/Joke", "That and rolling your sleeves in for some reason. I never actually got how that was fashionable", "I remember growing significantly between my junior and senior year (~16) and most of my friends did too. I only remember because I was allowed to go to the mall with my friends a lot when my mom got tired of me asking for bigger pants every other werk.", "Yes, that\u2019s why you should but your teenager clothes that fit them at their current size."]}
