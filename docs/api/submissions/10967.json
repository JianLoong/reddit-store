If you know that your daughter wearing the size she is requesting will lead to her being out of compliance with the dress code, then it will be a waste of money to buy the shirts in the wrong size. The purpose of the uniform is to facilitate a focus on academics, not individual expression.", "INFO. What was your reasoning for TWO sizes up versus one to give that a try?", "So you decided to give her two sizes bigger when you could've just went up...One size? YTA. Size charts also aren't always accurate to be honest, especially with the quality of school uniforms these days.", "NTA but you need to get used to your daughter doing her own thing more and more. This is a simple, safe way for her to express her autonomy in an age appropriate way. I think you should make it up to her in some way like letting her pick out a non-school shirt for herself or something. Let her express her developing adulthood in a controlled way.\n\nI don't think you did anything wrong but I think they might help show her that you want the best for her but also understand she is getting older.", "NTA. Young teens often want to wear clothes that are tighter or smaller than appropriate. It might be important to have a discussion about the difference between school clothes and clothes that you wear to the mall or to hang out with friends. If the school has already been giving her warnings, she definitely needed a larger size.", "When you purchased clothing sizes for teens that are much larger than the size they wear, the story they tell themselves is that you see them that size.

It's been a common approach from parents for years upon years to buy clothes/uniform bigger to allow room for growth and save money. Uniforms can be expensive so seems fair to buy bigger. Also, what is the world coming to where buying your child a uniform in a size that fits and is required by the school has to even be debated like this?! NTA.", "This whole thing was asking for trouble. YTA not for buying the appropriate size but for how you handled that decision.\n\nDid you tell her you were getting her a larger size ahead of time? Did you discuss with her why having multiple dress code warnings wasn\u2019t acceptable moving forward?\n\nI always think it\u2019s important in parenting to make clear when a child has control over something and when they don\u2019t. Your daughter thought she had control of deciding her shirt size when she didn\u2019t. That\u2019s where issues usually come from. That\u2019s where body issues can start. Your daughter thought you were getting one size for her and instead you got her two sizes larger because you though that\u2019s what she needs. Even if that\u2019s the case that can be jarring for a teenager.\n\nI don\u2019t think you are wrong for getting your daughter an appropriate sized shirt. I think your misstep was not priming your daughter for getting a larger size. You both should have has a talk before this about why she couldn\u2019t wear the size she wanted and what she was getting instead.\n\nAfter talking about dress codes and her comfort level and all the things I would have told her she can either have me do it and get the size that\u2019s recommended, with the understanding that it will only be returned if it\u2019s uncomfortably large, or that she can come with me and try on the other sizes, knowing that she may still not get the size she wants.\n\nYour daughter wants to look cute and feel pretty. Teenagers are always looking for control because they don\u2019t even have control over their own body. They have adult feeling without adult wisdom and their trying to learn a whole new way to interact with the world.\n\nI feel for both and you and your teenager. You couldn\u2019t pay be to be fourteen again.", "I\u2019m confused how you interpreted a \u201clittle too small\u201d meant two sizes larger was required. This would have made me feel like trash if my mother had done this. YTA. One size is enough and I promise this isn\u2019t the hill worth dying on.", "Ik that she\u2019s the one who has to wear it and it\u2019s her choice. But she\u2019s 14 and it\u2019s her school uniform, it wouldn\u2019t kill her to wear something loose. \nNTA.", "NTA - this is an extremely common tactic that parents do to save money - get something a little big so kids can \u201cgrow into it.\u201d Could you let her earn $$ to get one in the size she prefers? Or ask your sister for money since she has an opinion?", "nta \n\nIt's your responsibility to look after her and provide the correct sized clothing, that's what you're doing. \n\nIf this is an issue of her being overweight and in denial you need to find a way to discuss this with her though. \n\nSimilarly if its a case of her breasts creating an 'issue' you need to find a way to discuss this without shaming her for her body type.", "Can your daughter try on the shirt before it\u2019s purchased? That way, you and she can see which size fits best.", "NTA. This is the age old battle of \u201cyou\u2019ll grow into it\u201d that parents have had with their kids since time immemorial. My mom was given a teenager sized bike for her 6th birthday with that \u201cyou\u2019ll grow into it\u201d statement, my dad was given too long jeans that had to be rolled up with that statement. When I wore uniforms my mom bought my skirts a few sizes bigger so as I grew they could be let out and still fit. \n\nYour daughter wants to look cute at school, but wearing clothes that she can\u2019t fit in isn\u2019t something that she needs to do.", "Or body shaming her chest / thinking boobs existing makes them sexual. I think that's what the school may be doing, and the parent too, tbh.", "So does that mean the world should change the age of what they classify as a legal adult then? Since yknow, the brain isn't fully developed until the mid 20's.

I knew it wasn't the case for me or many relatives so I looked it up\n\n\"Myth: menarche means the end of growth is nearThe reality is that the average gain in height after menarche is about 7 cm (3 inches), and it is even greater for girls who menstruate on the early side of normal. Follow-up data from the Fels Longitudinal Study show that girls who start menstruating at age 10 grow, on average, 10 cm (4 inches), while those in whom menarche is delayed until age 15 grow, on average, 5 cm (2 inches) \"\n\n\"[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1070801/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1070801/)", "Kind of have to factor in potential weight gain, could be drastic sometimes you never know what could happen during those years of high school.", "She \u2026 did?", "I mean, uniforms are expensive. If two sizes up matches the daughter's measurements, I think it makes perfect sense to buy something that both fits and will last longer. I get that the daughter wants a \"fitted\" look, but it sounds like \"fitted\" means \"tight\" and will also be outgrown more quickly. This seems pretty reasonable and just kind of part of what uniform life is like.", "You say this not knowing how small the top was. It could have been two sizes. Hence, a two size increase would be reasonable.", "A better idea than going and buying a size that doesn't properly fit.", "So how does that make the daughter an AH?", "The world doesn't classify a legal adult in the same way everywhere. Some have it set at 21, others have it set at 16 or younger.  I argue that there may even be some 25-30 year old's that lack maturity to make good decisions. There has to be a common standard set. At 18 one has (usually) graduated high school and possibly is employed. But still may be receiving appropriate guidance. Some 16 year old kids may make better choices than their 40 year old parents. But in a case where you see your child is OBVIOUSLY not making mature and appropriate decisions you must be a parent and guide them accordingly. Stuffing kids into a bubble and not allowing them to live and learn to make good choices is detrimental. There are appropriate milestones that we reach at varying points in our maturity. Learning from mistakes and gaining this life experience at appropriate times is important. This girl here is seemingly attempting inappropriate dress for school by wearing too tight shirts. She is even getting in trouble for it. She should not be allowed to dress this way and being corrected is to her benefit. \n\nYour question makes not much sense. Because the question is not whether legal age is at work here. It's a matter of a child needing correction.

I was probably 5\u20193.5\u201d when is started, I grew another 2\u201d in the years following and topped out at 5\u20195.5\u201d by 16. I\u2019ve been that tall for almost 20 years now.", "Huh, that's really interesting! I stand corrected. I had heard it from a lecturer in my gender across cultures class and because I personally stopped with menarche, I just kind of assumed it was universal. Cursed to be 5'3\u00bd forever lol", "True but I still think getting a uniform one size up is still better than 2, or even just getting a properly fitting uniform and seeing if there's a uniform exchange that they can take advantage of if she does need a bigger one", "If you never know what could happen, she could lose weight during those years too.", "She went two sizes up. She should have only gone one", "Uniforms are expensive but extremely lack in quality (this is coming from someone who wore a uniform during high school). They charge unearthly prices for things that will literally discolor or turn into a rag within a year or two regardless of sizing. Even if you get a shirt that is two sizes up, you don't know the potential of what could possibly change in the daughter if that makes sense. She could grow out of it in no time, she's 14.", "If the girl was being dress coded it was almost definitely two sizes too small.  \n\nOp you\u2019re fine.  Is your sister childless by any chance?

OP says the one size up shirt isn\u2019t much difference from the shirt her daughter already wore, so 2 sizes up makes sense.

Sisters definitely an asshole tho.", "I picked up two more inches after the start of my period, too. And I started late, even. 15, and I didn't stop growing until I was 20. I did slow down, but I had already done that before the periods began. So I'm not sure it had anything to do with that.", "Apparently, a lot of people think it's true, which is why they correct the myth. If it had been the case for me & my family I would have just assumed you were right.", "Actually she should have brought the daughter to try things on. She can't tell what size fits without doing that.", "I do still think that it's interesting that for many people, vertical growth does stop at menarche. Does it have to do with specific hormones or are there just an overwhelming amount of cases that have a false correlation? I'm gonna have to research this more"]}
