Some have it set at 21, others have it set at 16 or younger.  I argue that there may even be some 25-30 year old's that lack maturity to make good decisions. There has to be a common standard set. At 18 one has (usually) graduated high school and possibly is employed. But still may be receiving appropriate guidance. Some 16 year old kids may make better choices than their 40 year old parents. But in a case where you see your child is OBVIOUSLY not making mature and appropriate decisions you must be a parent and guide them accordingly. Stuffing kids into a bubble and not allowing them to live and learn to make good choices is detrimental. There are appropriate milestones that we reach at varying points in our maturity.
