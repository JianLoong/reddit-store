This might be more expensive at start, as you will have to pay two tickets, but it will allow her to be confident for the future.\n\nYour new wife needs to also accept the importance of your visits. You guys need to talk it out. Seriously. And maybe you need a second job if money is so tight.\n\nEveryone does a bit of sucking here, but I am very close to no assholes.

At what point can she no longer say, \"You're spending too much on your other kid?\" Right now the issue is over-priced same-day train tickets, but what about when that bare bones ten quid for a bus is \"too expensive\" or \"needs to be put towards OUR child\"? Where, precisely, is the line in which he can veto and say, \"No, that's unreasonable, I NEED to spend that money to see my 9yo.\"\n\nBecause it sounds like ex has primary custody; it sounds like these visits are the only time 9yo really gets with her dad.

Maybe you haven't seen youre partner cry during the week cause they just want to see their child. Talking about how much they miss them and talking about silly memories. Maybe you haven't seen them put all the effort into super sweet weekend plans, just for the other parent to say \"sorry she's staying here this weekend\" for whatever lame reason. Counting down days every night on the phone together till they can see each other again.  \n\nA child is part of you forever.
