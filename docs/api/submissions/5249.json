I know my daughter in law is an anxious person so I (with direction and help from my son) have gone to great lengths to make sure she is comfortable and feels safe here with the baby for Christmas.\n\nWe are only having a few people over, everyone has been reminded of hand washing and not to come if sick. \n\nI also picked up some things for the baby that they have at their house to make it and easier transition.\n\nHowever there is one big issue, the topic of diapers. I wanted to get a big box (168) so they wouldn\u2019t have to bring any but my son said to just get a 26 count box.\n\nThis seemed ridiculously low to me. I googled it and an 8 month old should be having 8 dirty diapers a day. They are staying for 3 days, assuming no accidents or blowouts that would barely be enough. When I mentioned this my son said that my granddaughter goes through about 6 a day only and he reasoned she was almost done with this current size so having extra to take home would be wasteful.\n\nThe conversation didn\u2019t sit well with me because my daughter in law is very \u201ceco\nconscious\u201d and so I wondered if they weren\u2019t changing my granddaughters diaper enough because of that.\n\n I gently asked my son if they thought she was getting changed enough and he got very defensive with me. Apparently the diapers have a \u201cwetness\u201d indicator that they check frequently and they know her schedule well, always immediately change her poopy diapers because they can tell without checking the indicator and they try and give her a lot of out of diaper time as their doctor told them that would help reduce the likelihood of diaper rash which he reminded me she hasn\u2019t had yet which he says indicates she is being changed frequently enough. \n\nHe assured me they are both extremely attentive parents and would not ever leave her sitting in a dirty diaper which I do believe especially after his clarifications.\n\nHowever my son has been cold to me since this conversation. I brought it up to my daughter as she lives here with me and we are quite close and she said it probably came off that I was being an asshole to him and judging his parenting. If I was the asshole I will apologize but if not I will leave it be. I don\u2019t feel I was being an asshole, just asking a question as a concerned grandmother.\n\nUpdate: Hi, sorry everyone I didn't know I could update. I see I am 100% in the wrong here and reading it back after everyone's comments that seems very obvious so I'm feeling quite silly. I will be apologizing sincerely tomorrow and not meddling again in the future. I really do try to be a great mom and MIL and grandma and not overbearing or a nightmare so I'm very disappointed in myself for this. It seemed inoccent at the time but I understand why it wasn't. \n\nPs. I LOVE my daughter in law and I just want to clarify the eco conscious comment. I was told by her that she and my son were trying something called EC and I misunderstood what it was and the purpose but did remember they said they were trying to be more environmentally conscious. So I conflated something and it came across poorly, I don't think she is neglectful because she is environmental I just made a mistake.", "created_utc": 1671581976, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zr4hwc/aita_for_expressing_concern_over_my_granddaughter/", "score": 573, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If 26 would have been enough, that means that, at worst, you might have had to run back to the store once. You wanted to buy 142 more diapers than you need- for someone who will grow out of it very quickly. And their luggage space is probably limited, too.\n\nI'm glad you accepted their responses. I would also remind you that most people don't perfectly fit the averages. They probably saw your questions as quite a bit judgmental. You should apologize for that.", "YTA\n\nYour, apparently, well meaning inquiry definitely comes off as judging the parenting, attentiveness, and priorities of your son and daughter in law.\n\nIt sounds like you have some latent issue with your daughter in law.  The way you instantly jumped to her \"eco-consciousness\" betrays that judgement, and explains her nervousness in regards to visiting you.\n\nPerhaps an apology and some self reflection may help your relationships here, which I would recommend if you want to keep seeing your grandchild.", "YTA. That was a MASSIVE leap from \u201cmaybe diapers are more absorbing than I realized\u201d to \u201cmy DIL is too cheap to buy more diapers and is neglecting her daughter\u201d. \n\n\nYou owe them an apology, and should practice keeping your nose where it belongs; on your face and out of their business.", "Yes YTA. \n\nYou WERE judging their parenting - with absolutely NO cause. You\u2019re reasons for concern were \u201cit seemed ridiculous\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t sit well with you\u201d and your DIL is \u201ceco conscious\u201d\n\nThese reasons are not based in any knowledge or fact. \n\nApologise to your son and DIL for doubting their parenting abilities. And in the future don\u2019t offer advice or judgment unless asked.", "YTA, that amount of diapers is way too much and way to wasteful for a temporary stay. They don\u2019t need that many diapers, and if they do they can get another small pack. Getting that big box just means they\u2019ll have more to tote back home again and they\u2019ll have more diapers to dispose of once baby grows out of them. \n\nYou\u2019re going way too far with your assumptions and you\u2019re being very condescending and catty and rude.\n\nEdit: A lot of diapers come with a strip indicator that goes from pale yellow to bright green when the diaper is soiled and it even indicates how soiled the diaper is because the colour change happens gradually.", "YTA. What you're suggesting is neglect. Think this through, do you honestly and truly believe that your son and DIL would ***neglect*** their child over two diapers a day?! Really? Because that's what you accused them of.\n\nYou can't predict how many times a day a child is going to use their diaper and when you look stuff up like that you have to understand those are ***averages***. Children in her age group may ***average*** 8 diapers a day, but that means that some children use *more* than 8, and others use *fewer* than 8. Congratulations, your GD uses fewer than 8.\n\nYou should be happy for her parents that she doesn't use more and they don't have to spend as much. Not angry at him and accusing him of neglecting his daughter because she doesn't use as many diapers per day as Google says she should.", "YTA just buy 26 and leave it at that.  If you run out,  send your son for more.", "YTA - Your daughter is right that you did come off as an AH to him, because to him it sounded like you were judging both him and his wife as being lazy, neglectful parents. \n\nYou read that 8 months old can have roughly 8 diapers a day, which yeah, they can. But it\u2019s not going to be *exact* for every baby. Some will do more, some will do less, for some it depends on the day. Using 6 diapers a day rather than 8 is nothing to worry about. You heard that and immediately jumped to blaming daughter-in-law because she\u2019s eco-conscious. That is unwelcoming behavior and if you make these insinuations regularly, that might play a part in why she\u2019s so anxious when she visits.\n\nYou should apologize for not trusting your son and his wife enough to know how to properly care for their baby.", "YTA. Everyone knows you don\u2019t judge people\u2019s parenting and what YOU suggested was blatant neglect.", "YTA. You weren't asking as a concerned grandmother, that's just convenient considering your relation to the child. And yes, it does come across as judgemental when you repeatedly question if you son and his wife can change their child properly. The parents know best, let them decide on what to buy because yeah, your son is right to point out that the 168 would be a waste considering the child is growing out of that size.", "YTA.  I changed my kids between 6-12 times a day, depending on the kid and what was going on. I had one kid that only pooped about once a week.  Really.  It happens. (Serially Google it, some kids are like that).  If parents are paying attention, 6 isn\u2019t at all unreasonable.  Changing more often also won\u2019t prevent diaper rash with some kids.  Some kids are just rash magnets, or have to have certain diapers. I had one kid who couldn\u2019t tolerate disposables, more than one disable a day, and horrible rashes, but when in cloth, was just fine.  And another kid who rarely got rashes at all.\n\nDefinitely apologize. Explain you are being paranoid and you shouldn\u2019t have taken it out on them, or something.  Make sure you apologize properly, the format is \u201cI\u2019m sorry.  I shouldn\u2019t have done it. I\u2019m doing xyz to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again\u201d", "YTA.   Softly, but yes.  You have overstepped.  You accused them of not diapering correctly over a Google search.   Of course they are offended.   You need to quickly and sincerely apologize to each of them separately.  \u201c I am sorry for doubting your parenting skills and making an issue over the diapers.  It was a careless mistake on my part.   I will strive to be respectful and see your perspective before I comment.  Surely I will continue to mess up, but please know my heart is to support and respect you both.\u201d   Basically own that you messed up, do not try to mitigate your error by placing blame elsewhere.   Tell them how you will make effort to do better.     I think it would be in your best interest to also ask your son for gentle feedback it it happens again.  And open heart and open mind will be the best recipe for goodwill with the new parents \n\nCongratulations and good luck.  Being the MIL can be difficult", "Back off or \u201cleave it be\u201d.  More conversation about this will not end well .", "YTA that was a bit much. My kids did not poop that much and as come people said, some kids do more and some do less. My kids also didn\u2019t have diaper rash issues. Some kids get diaper rash very easily. \n\nYou were implying they are doing a bad job.", "YTA - stop inserting yourself into other peoples family decisions. This isn\u2019t abuse, relax. Google also isn\u2019t a reliable source since every baby, diaper, etc is different. You are definitely overstepping and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not well received or making the mom feel \u201ccomfortable\u201d or less anxious.", "YTA - Apologize to your son and buy the 26 count box.  You meant to ask out of genuine concern but googled up the answer to how many dirty diapers a day instead of just asking your son, the parent.   You raised your son.  You should be able to trust his judgement.", "Soft YTA.\n\nIt may have come from a place of love and concern, but it 100% has come across as you questioning his and your DIL's competence as parents. I'd hope he knows his child's needs slightly more than a generalized Google search.\n\nYou offered to get X amount, he said that Y would be enough. A simple \"*you sure that'll be enough?*\" is all that was needed. Expressing concern is fine, but when you start questioning them in a way that undermines their ability as a parent (unless you see them doing something **really** wrong), read the room and politely back off.", "YTA.\n\nWho in the holy hell of bizzaro worlds questions their adult child on the amount of diapers used by said adult's infant? Lady, you need to take a HUGE step back. Like, back through a rip in time and space.", "Your daughter in law is \"an anxious person\" and you want \"to make sure she is comfortable and feels safe here\".  Yes?  How, exactly, did you think that your second-guessing their care of their daughter was going to help accomplish your supposed goal?\n\nUnless you directly observe evidence of abuse or neglect, MYOB and keep your opinions to yourself.  That includes those you think you're cleverly disguising in the form of \"innocent questions\".  YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou assumed they would let their daughter sit is diapers? Based solely on the fact that she is two diapers a day below average and your DIL likes the earth?  That is very very rude and you need to say your sorry.\n\nAnother note is that for something to be average there has to be some people above and some below that number .... That's how averages work.", "Soft YTA - I don't think you were intentionally doing anything to assume they were bad parents, but I think it might have come across that way to him. I would definitely apologize, new parents are sensitive about these things and I'm sure they're doing everything they can to take good care of their baby. You can always go out and buy a small additional package of diapers if you run out and I'm sure they'll have some with them as well.", "168 diapers for 3 days? That's wasteful.  \n\nThey know their baby, they know her schedule listen to them. I know you've done this before but its been a while since you had a baby and diapers have changed and do have a \"wet\" indicator. She's 8 months probably eating every 3-5 hours so that equals about the 6 diapers your son mentioned. Take a step back and think how you would react to someone saying they know your baby better than you did. \n\nYou're GRANDMA that means spoil and love. Let them be the parents and do what's best for them.\n\nbecause you're a grandma soft YTA", "YTA. By quite a distance.", "YTA. You didn't express concern for your granddaughter (which props to a very well worded argument in your defense). You criticized and questioned your son and DIL's parenting. How would you have felt if your MIL implied to your husband you aren't changing your baby's diapers regularly enough?", "YTA as evidence by the fact that you took the time to Google what Dr Google says is the typical amount of diapers and 8-month-old should be going through daily. Additionally the statement that they are \"eco-friendly\" lends Credence to the idea that you find their position on the environment dubious. \n\nYou have absolutely no idea how many diapers that they will be bringing with them as it is, yet you are questioning why you shouldn't be getting a damned value pack of almost 200 diapers for 3 days??! I would extend you the grace of saying that perhaps you really don't understand why your line of questioning was so offensive, if you step back and read all of the reasons that posters have clarified on here why your second guessing your son and his wife's parenting makes you the AH. \n\nI truly do hope that you can salvage their visit and make amends and that you guys have a lovely time together. Yeah I promise you it gets much easier when people remember that they are a grandparent and their job is not to be a second parent and is just to enjoy their grandchildren in a respectful manner as approved of by the actual parents. Good luck okay!", "YTA. You essentially accused your son and daughter in law of neglect because they change the baby two fewer times than Google told you a baby should be changed.\n\n> The conversation didn't sit well with me because my daughter in law is very \"eco conscious\" and so I wondered if they weren't changing my granddaughters diaper enough because of that.\n\nWhat in the hell even is this? I don\u2019t buy that you *gently* asked your son if the baby was being changed enough after that bizarre swipe at your daughter in law. Even if you weren\u2019t aggressive, I\u2019m sure your son knows you well enough to read you and **that** is why he\u2019s being cold. \n\nYou put your son in the position of having to defend his and his wife\u2019s parenting *to his own mother* because you googled \u2018*how many times should you change and eight month old*\u2019 and his wife is an environmentalist. Just wow. \n\nYou definitely need to apologize for your behavior.", "Info: why did you not trust your son when he told you how many diapers would be enough? Why did you feel the need to google it?\n\nEdit: yta", "Soft YTA. Your intentions came from a good place but they weren't communicated well, apparently.  \n\nAn apology would be appropriate for certain.  Just leaving it be may be problematic, especially if another miscommunication happens.", "Gonna go with soft YTA, maybe get more than 26, but not *that* many, they told you why they don\u2019t want that many and you should respect it, get a few extra just in case and yes do apologize because you definitely came across as judgmental", "You owe them an apology", "YTA you\u2019re being overbearing. They know their child and you need to trust their parenting. You basically implied that they were taking care of babe properly which is offensive. Do better!!", "When your son said they need X diapers, you should have gotten X diapers. If it seemed too low to you, you should have assumed that the parents, who have been changing diapers multiple times every day for 8 months, probably know what they are doing. Instead, you assumed you know better, and attempted to micromanage a mundane task, \u201cgently\u201d suggesting that they may be neglecting your granddaughter in the process.

It often happens overnight once they\u2019re sleeping longer stretches. If there was anything wrong with how they\u2019re approaching it baby would have diaper rashes and/or UTIs. \n\nIt may not seem like a big deal to you but in this day and age as parents of a young child you\u2019re constantly hearing people\u2019s unsolicited opinions and advice and it\u2019s exhausting.
