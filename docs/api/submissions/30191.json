But my mother has gotten upset about it before because it's more of a fresh wound for her than it ever will be for me.  \n\nYou were spaced out, not staring, and at least to me, the difference is really obvious. The lights are on, but nobody's home. When people are staring at me, they like, give me an ocular pat down.

Don't let it hurt you too much.", "NTA - only one person made a scene here, and it wasn't you.\n\nI have to admit, I'd have been tempted as hell to stare at *her* afterwards.\n\nBut seriously - she was rude and leapt to a conclusion without worrying about any supporting facts.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know what her problem was, but as a carer for a disabled person, she's not doing them any favors by drumming up a public scene over nothing at all.", "NTA. The daughter probably gets stared at a lot and it's become a reflex for the lady to assume that anyone looking in that direction is staring. The only reason the lady is TA is because she relentlessly went at you even after you told her you were just looking into space.", "Nta. She probably gets a lot of stares/comments and she assumes wrongly. I feel for the mother, but this was a time where she made the wrong judgment. You seemed to have handled the false accusations respectfully", "It sounds like this woman has no emotional control or understanding of how to separate from her own ego, this is simply not your problem. It comes down to how you handle your own choices here.", "NTA, I can understand that her child gets stares and comments often and is looking out for her. But her causing a scene was unnecessary and an overreaction, she could have tried to go about this in a discrete and polite manner. \n\nThere is a difference between staring and zoned out which you can tell if you pay just a little bit of attention.", "My uncle is blind.

I can cringe for DAYS about things I feel like I should have done/said differently, especially when I experience such a harsh interaction.", "NTA -- the mother was wrong and overprotective and invasive of your privacy. It's one of those unpleasant misunderstandings. You did nothing wrong. She did, but accelerating it by apologizing and explaining would have made her angrier.

It\u2019s a natural reaction. Like what the heck is he doing. I even do it, and my son and I laugh. He is seven. \n\nYou were day dreaming. I do it too. I bet a lot of people do when they are exhausted. She must be extremely self-conscious, and must have had some problems with people in the past. Nothing you could\u2019ve said could make her calm down. \n\nI\u2019ve met some other parents who are very up tight about everything their kid does, and if anyone even looks they get upset and make a scene. You won\u2019t win with everyone. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are a bad person at all.

Yep. Still still cringing.", "This sort of thing happens sometimes. You *should* make an effort not to stare at people, of course, but sometimes other people are just having a bad day of their own and don't care who they take it out on.\n\nNext time this happens, don't try to explain or defend yourself. You don't know these people and it's a total waste of breath. Just mutter \"Oh, sorry\" and then walk away. It doesn't matter if you're actually sorry or not - your goal is to simply defuse the situation and get out of there.

I just space out and stare in a general direction then I notice some one noticing me and it hits that it looks like i've been mean mugging this person for the past 5 minutes lmao.

Some people think Everything is about them.", " NTA You did nothing wrong. That woman was overly sensitive because of her child and handled it badly. There was no need for her to yell at you.

I was listening to and laughing at a podcast on the Tube and someone seated across from me decided I was laughing at her convo with her friend. She did back down when she realised I had earbuds in and couldn't have heard her, but she was really aggressive at first.\n\nSorry that happened to you.", "When they're staring at you and they're actually spaced out staring back or waving at them usually causes them to readjust and look directly at you so you can see the change in direction in the way they move their head and eyes. There can also be a bit of a shake of the head when they try to come back to planet earth.", "I have two disabled kids, pretty clearly cognitively challenged. I'm just glad when we can enjoy activities in public at all. It's likely that some people think unkind things, but honestly, there's just not enough time in the day to be second-guessing strangers.", "You're a better person than I am, I would've made it a point to stare directly at her(the mom) for the rest of the ride. Maybe even play on my phone at an angle that could suggest I was taking pictures", "The person explained and she continued to snap. As someone with a dissociative disorder if this happened to me after I explained, that would be ableist.", "I never said it wasn't? Yes it's hard, I'm not one for not holding myself accountable personally. It sounds like the mother simply wasn't holding herself accountable, she was over-projecting.\n\nI can also see how the mother's behaviour would negatively affect her disabled child.  The disabled child would likely interpret her mother yelling as something is 'wrong' with their disability. That's simply not the case, like anything, it comes down to how we carry our disabilities.", "It is dissociation, though. Dissociation is a spectrum that comes in many different forms and is described as \u201cDisconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions, and identity.\u201d This is an example of mild disconnection from surroundings and actions. Zoning out, daydreaming, etc. is the type of dissociation that literally everyone experiences. There\u2019s more severe types such as dissociation that occurs during traumatic events, within PTSD, and with transient stress and other mental illnesses, and there\u2019s structural dissociation and dissociative disorders involving complete amnesia and blackouts. And more, and more. Dissociation comes in many different forms and is not just something people with trauma or a mental illness experience, although it\u2019s a serious symptom", "You have such a good attitude my dude (or gal) and it's really refreshing to hear, I could really take a leaf out of your book myself haha", "Yeah, I'm a wheelchair user, 52 yo, but my mum would be straight at anyone who she thought was at me.... NTA OP. It's a touchy mum. Not her fault, but don't take it to heart", "Why would you actively try and make the mother of a disabled child's life harder to the point where you actually want her to believe you're taking pics of her and the kid? It sounds like a real good way of getting your shit rocked for being a pretty nasty person.", "Evil but I got a chuckle.", "Right. My point is that even with the explanation, the nerves are so thin and the trauma is so really that it\u2019s irrelevant. No one is the asshole. This woman\u2019s experience is hard than most people can imagine\u2026 im cutting her slack aware that she\u2019s probably more exhausted and lonely and jaded that most people can comprehend", "I was just trying to add perspective. Most people don\u2019t really understand the kind of stress she\u2019s under. You can take it or leave it", "As per the great Kel: we\u2019re all dudes.", "I understand that completely. I do think the mom was the AH in this scenario but it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s an AH in general\u2026 I understand her being stressed and her going through a lot raising her child. More than most parents and parents in general get judged very harshly now. As someone in trauma recovery myself, it\u2019s on us to accept that our actions aren\u2019t always right, even if they\u2019re self protective mechanisms and we believed we saw the scenario correctly at the time. Once we know more, we need to do better and try to regulate. It doesn\u2019t mean we are bad, but we do need to be responsible. I hope the mom gets the social and mental support she needs and help to figure out how to regulate in difficult scenarios because it isn\u2019t easy", "Do you have a child that is disabled in a way that every bit of their life is impacted? Then you don\u2019t. \n\nHave you ever been so deliriously tired that you questioned your own reality? That\u2019s her life - every day. \n\nPeople say they get it and they just don\u2019t"]}
