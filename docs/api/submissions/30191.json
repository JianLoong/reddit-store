But my mother has gotten upset about it before because it's more of a fresh wound for her than it ever will be for me.  \n\nYou were spaced out, not staring, and at least to me, the difference is really obvious. The lights are on, but nobody's home. When people are staring at me, they like, give me an ocular pat down.

Don't let it hurt you too much.", "NTA - only one person made a scene here, and it wasn't you.\n\nI have to admit, I'd have been tempted as hell to stare at *her* afterwards.\n\nBut seriously - she was rude and leapt to a conclusion without worrying about any supporting facts.", "NTA. \n\nI don't know what her problem was, but as a carer for a disabled person, she's not doing them any favors by drumming up a public scene over nothing at all.", "NTA. The daughter probably gets stared at a lot and it's become a reflex for the lady to assume that anyone looking in that direction is staring. The only reason the lady is TA is because she relentlessly went at you even after you told her you were just looking into space.", "Nta. She probably gets a lot of stares/comments and she assumes wrongly. I feel for the mother, but this was a time where she made the wrong judgment. You seemed to have handled the false accusations respectfully", "It sounds like this woman has no emotional control or understanding of how to separate from her own ego, this is simply not your problem. It comes down to how you handle your own choices here.", "NTA, I can understand that her child gets stares and comments often and is looking out for her.

I can cringe for DAYS about things I feel like I should have done/said differently, especially when I experience such a harsh interaction.", "NTA -- the mother was wrong and overprotective and invasive of your privacy. It's one of those unpleasant misunderstandings. You did nothing wrong. She did, but accelerating it by apologizing and explaining would have made her angrier.

It\u2019s a natural reaction. Like what the heck is he doing. I even do it, and my son and I laugh. He is seven. \n\nYou were day dreaming. I do it too. I bet a lot of people do when they are exhausted. She must be extremely self-conscious, and must have had some problems with people in the past. Nothing you could\u2019ve said could make her calm down. \n\nI\u2019ve met some other parents who are very up tight about everything their kid does, and if anyone even looks they get upset and make a scene. You won\u2019t win with everyone. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are a bad person at all.

Yep. Still still cringing.", "This sort of thing happens sometimes. You *should* make an effort not to stare at people, of course, but sometimes other people are just having a bad day of their own and don't care who they take it out on.\n\nNext time this happens, don't try to explain or defend yourself. You don't know these people and it's a total waste of breath. Just mutter \"Oh, sorry\" and then walk away.

I just space out and stare in a general direction then I notice some one noticing me and it hits that it looks like i've been mean mugging this person for the past 5 minutes lmao.
