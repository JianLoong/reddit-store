{"id": 1245, "submission_id": "ym1oqn", "title": "AITA for expecting my dad to keep his word and pay my tuition?", "selftext": "Ever since I was 11 years old, it has been established that I would pursue my higher education abroad. For context, I come from a developing nation and it has always been a dream of mine to study and work abroad. My parents and I have had several conversations about this for the last 10 years, and we decided that I would complete graduate school (Masters) abroad. I would pay for it myself if I could, but people from third world countries like mine cannot work a fair paying job, at least not until they have a Master's. And in my field (Psychology), it's downright impossible to get a job until you have a Masters and possibly more qualifications. You cannot even take out a loan without any assets. So, my father promised he would cover my tuition and I told him I'd pay him back in installments as soon as I got a job and had some savings. This was decided last year, and I have began applying to USA this month for Fall 2023. \n\nSo here's where the issue lies. My dad is kind of old fashioned and patriarchal, always has been. It's part of the reason why I want to escape far away in the first place, because the constant control makes me sick. Everything has to go through him- what I wear, eat, where I go, etc, even if I do it all by my own money. So yesterday, my friends spontaneously decided to meet up in the afternoon. My dad was at work so I told my mom (she's a SAHM)  that I'm going out to meet them and left. I informed her where I was, with who and when I should be expected back. However, when my dad called my mom for unrelated reasons, he found out I had gone out. All hell broke loose. He called me up, screaming and telling me that I was being disrespectful and not acknowledging his status as the \"man of the house\". He told me I couldn't simply get up and go and had to seek permission from him. I told him that I had told my mom and hadn't sneaked out, but he was hysterical. Kept shouting, until he eventually hung up. \n\nWhen he came home after work, he told me that he had changed his mind about paying my tuition. He said that he didn't trust me enough to take care of myself abroad as I had proved I wasn't \"responsible\" enough after what happened yesterday. I panicked, because I have already began applying and did not know what else to arrange, especially in the span of two to three months. I told him that he was being irrational and punishing me beyond what I deserved. But he wouldn't hear it and called me entitled. My mom thinks I'm entitled too for expecting him to pay for it. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1667575025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym1oqn/aita_for_expecting_my_dad_to_keep_his_word_and/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It looks like your dad has picked a fight over nothing and is using it as an excuse not to pay your tuition. I suspect that he didn't want you to study abroad in the first place. Now it is close to the time you are supposed to leave he deliberately started this argument just so he can punish and keep you at home.", "NTA. Take out loans or look into other options to fund your education. Don\u2019t take money with strings attached especially when they are unknown or would control your future.", "Definitely NTA, it should be the number 1 priority for parents to help their kids with a good education (if they can afford it). They should also teach you to be independant. Your Dad sounds like a very controlling human being :( \n\nINFO (does not change my verdict): did you go out with friends only telling your mom about it ever before? What was your fathers reaction then?", "NTA, your father is too controlling as you're obviously an adult. Does any of your extended family know he offered to pay for your Masters and is now withdrawing it? Would he lose face over it? Is there anyone that could persuade him to change his mind?\n\nSee if you're eligible for scholarships from foundations or organizations to assist people from developing countries. You may habe to defer a year but you can use that time to build your financial resources. Alternatively are there twinning programs in your country where you spend a few months overseas but complete most of your degree locally?", "NTA but for now, give a fake and convincing apology, anything to get you to school abroad. Once you are in another country, enjoy living your best life while continuing to follow his rules when you are back home. Keep your eye on the long term.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Which you should be well aware considering his history. He doesn't sound like a great parent.\n\nFigure out how to backtrack the current conflict to appease him and get your way, or start working on alternate solutions for college.", "NTA but that's kind of irrelevant, in that you can't force him to pay for college. Whether you are an asshole or not (you aren't), you should start looking for alternatives.", "go to Germany. education here is for free", "NTA, your dad overreacted, but I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re going to be able to make him see the light. Keep applying anyways, and look for graduate assistantships and scholarships at the schools you\u2019re applying to. You\u2019re still early enough in the cycle that they\u2019ll be available, assuming international students are eligible.", "NTA. Holy crap your dad is a total narcissist! You did everything right when going out spontaneously, by keeping touch, making sure your location was known at all times, making sure they knew what you were doing. He is just mad that HE was unable to control the situation. And because he is mad about you for making your own decisions, he decides to last second bail on you. You were relying on that money to make it on your own, and he is ripping that away because he does not think you are responsible? That is BS. Clearly, he changed his mind because he wants to continue having control over you. Get OUT of there somehow. Apply for financial aid, scholarships, anything you can to leave that house. Otherwise, your dad will be controlling you for the rest of your life.", "NTA...\n\n... but that doesn't pay your tuition.  And you aren't going to change your father's mind by showing him the opinions of online strangers.\n\nFrankly, your father has been using this promise of tuition as a tool to keep you in line for the last several years.  Now that the time is coming up, he has decided he does not want you to go abroad.  *(It could also be that he doesn't want to spend the money, but I don't think that is the problem).* He is using this extremely minor disagreement as an excuse to take back his promise.\n\nThe only recourse I see is for you to go ahead with your plans for graduate school.  You may be surprised at what financial aid might be available to you once you are accepted at the school. In fact you may want to consider applying to additional schools with more consideration for the price of tuition and the availability of financial aid--including work-study jobs at the school.\n\nYou are 21 years old.  The only way to show your father that you are a responsible adult is to make your own way.  (And perhaps, once you have shown your determination to proceed with your plans, he may help you financially after all.)", "NTA.\n\nI don't fully understand the circumstances you are in, but it sounds pretty bad. The main issue is that you depend on your dads help to get away. \n\nIf you have any other means of getting abroad(maybe a european country where education is free), you could try that. Or try apeasing your dad until you can get out. \n\nUnfortunately he seem to have the power to ruin your life, so you need to be very careful with how you proceed.", "NTA. But is it a possibility that graduate school in the US is completely unaffordable for your father? Maybe he is using this as an excuse because he isn't willing to admit he can't afford it. Personally, I would never expect my family to pay for a postgraduate degree in the US - we're talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars - because the cost of living in the US is quite high also. There are excellent graduate programs in Europe that are far less expensive for equally good degrees (especially the UK, but the Netherlands also have excellent all english masters programs). Have you tried applying for grants? He may be more willing to pay only part of the fees if you already a grant based on merit that covers some of it!", "Well definetly NTA  for wanting him to pay for your tuitions.also he sounds like a bad person.\n\nBut the sad reality is tho that he isnt required to pay your tuition either(assuming you Will be legally adult when these tuition fees would be needed to pay).\nSadly , he can change his mind, and unfortunately you are not entitled to him paying the tuitions,even when a *good parent* would do that.\n\n\nI hope you Will find a way to pursue your Dreams.", "YTA for studying psychology when you from a 3rd world country, psychology degree in a 3rd wild country is like going to university for an art degree, it\u2019s useless unless you have rich parents who don\u2019t have a problem spoiling you financially.", "OP wants to work abroad.", "How can she be TA for wanting to study something she likes? What is the alternative? Studying something she doesn't wanna do later?\nAnd as someone metioned before, she wants to work abroad as well. She can work in that kind of field in the future.", "She could have got a degree that would make her money to move abroad then study psychology when she is abroad without relying on her father.", "Dude you would be surprised how these money drivens think. I had one for a teacher and he literally showed a video (by what I later found out was a super far right group) that told us to chase money and don't follow our dreams or passions because its a waste of time and doesn't add anything to the world.", "psychology is just not a lucrative industry in a 3rd world country, more than likely she will just end up a teacher and be under her father\u2019s financial thump until he marries her off.", "People from 3rd world don\u2019t have the luxury to not be money driven, that\u2019s privileged talk like going to uni for an arts and crafts degree unless you have a sports scholarship.", "That sounds really horrible. I think you should always do what YOU wanna do as long as it hurts nobody.\nBeing rich alone doesn't make someone happy. Teaching that kind of stuff is really horrible.", "But she wants to study and work in another country and I would guess the country will not be a 3rd world country.\nSo she gets out (from her father) and maybe get a good job. Win / win I would say.", "Do you know a 16yr old that works at McDonald\u2019s earns more than someone with a decent degree in a 3rd world country ? Now look at it from that point of view.", "It's not being rich. It's having enough to live comfortably. That does make someone happy. Being poor is a huge stress on a person. It's a 3rd world country they have to be money driven. To ensure they have enough to survive", "Well, her father is refusing to fund her, how\u2019s that a win ? All I am saying is she could have chosen a lucrative degree find work that pays off, save up and go study her psychology degree abroad use her lucrative degree to fund her living costs whilst going to uni for her  psychology  degree now that\u2019s a win.", "Exactly."]}
