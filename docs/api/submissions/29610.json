Having read your a female and hearing the history of how women are ignored by doctors this might give you some purpose or not.  If your goal is to just vent then so be it.  But it seems to also be an opportunity to aggressively let him know that he is failing his female patients by dismissing needs that he has been taught to ignore by generations of male doctors and he needs to do better.  He is also capitulating to the greed of insurance and the business of medicine by not doing testing that is expensive to insurance companies and not profitable for doctors.  Being a small town doctor means there are not a lot of options so if he isn\u2019t going to take the concerns of patients properly then he is hurting his community.  \nThese are just a few thoughts that would make you look less like a bitter patient that he might use to excuse your letter.", "I\u2019m not trying to say its oke of whatever.
