Having read your a female and hearing the history of how women are ignored by doctors this might give you some purpose or not.  If your goal is to just vent then so be it.  But it seems to also be an opportunity to aggressively let him know that he is failing his female patients by dismissing needs that he has been taught to ignore by generations of male doctors and he needs to do better.  He is also capitulating to the greed of insurance and the business of medicine by not doing testing that is expensive to insurance companies and not profitable for doctors.  Being a small town doctor means there are not a lot of options so if he isn\u2019t going to take the concerns of patients properly then he is hurting his community.  \nThese are just a few thoughts that would make you look less like a bitter patient that he might use to excuse your letter.", "I\u2019m not trying to say its oke of whatever.

They should at least know so they can do better.", "I get that, but those people in your group aren\u2019t legal or medical experts so it\u2019s worth doing some research or reaching out to r/legaladvice to see what you can do.", "good for you! (i mean that genuinly, not sarcastically). i'm a very angry, spiteful person so honestly if i had the option of spending my last months of life making my best effort to viciously ruin someone like that doctor's life, it'd probably make me pretty happy. but that's me, not you.\n\ni hope that luck and lawyers are on your side and things go fast enough that before the end arrives you can know that asshole will never have the chance to fuck up anyone else's life.", "Thats the thing about cycles. They arent a ride you get off and on once like people pretend. Youre just in the loop, forever. You might sit at acceptance for a while, and id guess thats the goal to go out at. But its not a then b then c and stay at c forever. And I think its a disservice to pretend it is. Hell, id say everyone is in the loop. Any time people pray for beinf saved, thats barginning. Existincial dread at the concept of death? Depression. Most people spend most time in acceptance. Youre being forced to live a lifetime of that cycle in an incredibly short time. \n\nIm glad something i said resonated. Quite honestly, im of the view of do whatever you need to. If its scorched earth in his life, I hope it burns bright. Some would just go \"he couldnt have known\" and been sad, and if that works for them great. Theres no one right path, and theres no knowing if you made the right one until its over. Least writing the letter has the tiny, tiny chance of making him feel a fraction of what youre losing, and might save someone else (no value on which reason your write it, imo. The important part is you want to.)", "I was just told that I can possibly set a lawsuit up that can basically be executed for me so I will be calling about that in the morning.", "I had no ideal you could actually sue. I am going to report him then. Sueing is a bit useless (I mean my timeline RN looks BLEAK) but this guy should NOT be a doctor.", "You sound like my therapist. I floated it with her and she said \"sweetheart you are terminal. If you need to smoke crack to feel better, do it\" solid advice TBH. What am I gonna overdose? lolllll", "Good luck!", "That's awesome (in as far as anything is awesome.) There are plenty of shit doctors (and not enough doctors) so it can be hard to get people barred from practising, but the framework is there. I'm so glad you're talking to a lawyer.", "The executor of your estate will also have the right to sue for medical malpractice leading to wrongful death after you pass.  You can write everything down for them, or make a video explaining your experience and how often you asked for testing and your doctor\u2019s response, and they can enter your statement into evidence for that case.  Usually, that would be hearsay they couldn\u2019t introduce into the case, but when someone dies, there\u2019s an exception for essentially letting them have a last say.  So if you want him to be sued but don\u2019t want to spend your limited remaining time on doing it yourself, gather the documents and write out the timeline (when you had symptoms, each time you asked for testing, when new symptoms appeared or old ones got worse, etc), and record yourself talking about what is happening to you and why and how things went from start to finish.  Leave that with your executor, and they will be able to sue on your behalf.\n\nIt won\u2019t help you, it\u2019s too late for that, but it could mean more money to go to whomever your heirs are and creating a record of what he did to you that other people will be able to find if they look him up.", "Report him to the AMA, as well. Very sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this", "Honestly, long as you dont physically hurt anyone else or truamatize an innocent person, do you g. \n\nI am at my core both an enabler and against harming others. So long as you dont go murdering the doc, im on your side op.\n\nGood luck with the scans and everything, and i hope whatever you write breaks that doc", "I had no ideal about any of that I will be calling a lawyer. I am in the hospital RN because of a liver tumor blockage (you really do turn so yellow. I am back to normal now but damn) but I should be able to leave tonight or tomorrow. I will call in the morning if I am out. I feel horrible I can't be here for my nieces and nephews, maybe I could send a few to school from beyond the grave who knows. Thank you so much for the advice.", "I would never dream of hurting anyone else. Even suing this guy is tying me up in nots even though he 100% deserves it. Thank you so much for the advice. And thank you for the luck", "I wish there was more that I could do.  It\u2019s a really shitty situation you\u2019ve been put in (agh, I noticed the pun, and as someone else with digestive issues, I couldn\u2019t resist leaving it in, but feel like I shouldn\u2019t be joking right now)", "Also, when you make your video record for this case, talk about that.  Talk about the people you\u2019re leaving behind, who you thought you\u2019d have a lifetime with.  I\u2019d suggest doing multiple sessions.  One focused on your symptoms and how you asked for help/testing and the progression and repeated brushing off.  One talking about the pain and suffering you\u2019ve experienced over the years and what you\u2019re experiencing now, and what you\u2019ve been told to expect.  One about the things you\u2019d expected to do with your life, the people you\u2019d expected to be with, etc.", "Believe me I am awful about jokes. I keep telling people on reddit they can tell me their secrets cause dead men tell no tales (Check my username lol). During my scans after I got jaundice I made the techs play Yellow by Coldplay. They had no ideal if they were allowed to laugh or not it was hilarious."]}
