I wouldn\u2019t have given him any money back though. He needed to honor his promise.", "Frankly, you shouldn't have even given him half. He told you more than once that dinner is on him.

NTA but he is a huge one.", "You're NTA for him breaking a promise.", "This is not an AITA, this is a misunderstanding.", "NTA,.  if he didn't want to pay in the first place, he shouldn't have invited you out and say that he'd pay.  what a jerk.", "NTA and I wouldn't have sent him a dime! You don't invite people and tell them that you will pay and then turn around and demand money! He sounds like a d*ck!", "NTA I think you\u2019re crazy for sending him any. He offered to pay. The acceptance of the invitation was based on that. Just keep this in mind next time he invites you anywhere", "He might have. Him communicating that would have been so much better and understandable.", "Never once did he communicate that he wanted to be paid back. He\u2019s pretty thorough when it comes to money and keeping tabs on what he\u2019s owed. This was the first time he\u2019s ever tried something like this.", "I agree.

BBQ at his place? Assume he's going to ask you to bring the meat (the most expensive part). Thanksgiving dinner at his house? Plan for him to send you a bill. \n\nIDK what kind of game he was playing with this dinner, but it's at least one that he can only play once.", "You aren't the ones handling the check, he is. Next time just walk out because you didn't agree to pay shit, and he didn't tell the waiter it was being split. Legally, he's the one obligated to pay", "Which means your meals were less than $40 each. \n\nNTA", "INFO: what did you order? \n\nIf, for example, you ordered 3 courses and an expensive bottle of wine and the lobster while everyone else was eating pizza, then you took advantage of his offer. If you followed FBIL\u2019s lead about what was being ordered, then he did a very strange thing.", "NTA. He said he would pay. I would be so pissed.", "Wanna bet he's gonna be shocked when you decline his next invite to go out to eat? \n\nNTA. And you should NOT have sent any money tbh (at least IMO).", "Ah the classic bait switch. NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd since he's shown you who he is, believe him and don't go out to dinner with him again.", "You were invited out by FBIL.  He offered to pay.  \n\nYou would not have gone out if you had to pay for yourselves as you are tight money right now.\n\nHe was the a$$ for not saying he expected to pay you back.\n\nNTA", "NTA,how you invite someone out and say your gonna pay and when they having a good time you telling them to pay. At this point say you gotta go to the bathroom bring the bags and leave his ass there.", "NTA, who does that????", "Did you take advantage of him: ordering more than one thing per person on the purpose to have leftover?", "If I was you, this is the last time I'd go anywhere else on his invitation. This is such a crappy thing to do to someone. Getting you there under false pretenses, knowing your financial situation and then holding you over a barrel. It's nasty, dishonest and would be a deal breaker for me. It may as well be premeditated. \n\nHe said twice he was going to pay. Twice. \n\nWhat a peach!", "This is funny because I've been to plenty of BBQs where you bring your own meat and beer. It's pretty normal I think in Australia.", "Next time? Lol", "NTA. He invited you and said he was paying", "He wanted to pretend to be big man bucks and then realized he was broke \ud83d\ude2d NTA.", "NTA. I think it may border on entitled to insist on a promised gift, so in your position on his request I would have paid for *my* meal, but breaking a promise like he did is an act that I'd expect to end a friendship. But a couple dollars are worth that to some people.", "nta - never go out with him again. that is a very strange power play on his part.", "NTA, and NEVER accept an 'invitation' from him again.", "NTA. Don't accept any more invites from him. WTF?", "NTA, but really, instead of everyone getting mad and defensive, y'all just need to have a conversation and find out where/how the misunderstanding occurred.", "NTA. FBIL invited you on his dime. Will he bill you for your dinner at their wedding reception l?", "Unless OP did something a**holish during the meal like order a mass of extra food. Or the most expensive things on the menu.\n\nEdit to add - OP has said elsewhere this is not the case.", "[removed]", "No, dad did pay for girlfriend", "He might be a complete dumbass and by 'I'll pay' he meant 'I'll cover the bill at the restaurant instead of splitting it, and you pay me back', but like... if that's what you mean, you say that shit.", "I would talk with your fiance about the brother's past behavior. This was obviously a power move he played on his brother using deception. How well do you know their relationship?", "Yeah- your BIL is weird and this is shady. Does he have a history of doing this? This borders on a mental health issue.", "NTA \n\nIf going out to dinner and paying for 5 people (maybe $200ish) will set you back until payday, you shouldn\u2019t be going out to dinner even if it\u2019s just you and significant other.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop believing that Ah.", "Okay bro \ud83d\ude0e", "Whom are you quoting?", "Yathink maybe his dad showing up changed things? Dad's more frugal, so FBIL didn't want to look the spendthrift in front of him? Or Dad likes you (even?) less than FBIL does, so didn't want to be seen doing you any favours? Just some WAGs.", "It's a bot", "Info- when someone else is paying, I get a small entree, no appetizer, no dessert. You got enough to be bagging it up at the end. Can't judge without knowing if you ordered enough for him to think you were taking advantage of him.", "NTA\n\nHe literally changed the conditions, and probably colluded with his dad to get you to pay.", "It is the people who asks us out that usually suppose to pay or has that concept been outdated. If so, opie just never go out with FBIL, he is an ahole.", "If the internet has taught me anything it\u2019s that words are indeed hard for some.", "NTA; It is very poor form to expect reimbursement if inviting and insisting on paying.  You commented on what you ordered so it isn't like you abused his hospitality.\n\nI would let this go as point of contention with FBil but view it as demonstration of his character as a petty man who cannot be taken at his word.", "NTA this is crazy offer to pay and after all is done demand repayment. Who does that?", "NTA, and dang, your FBIL is a jerk.", "FBIL claims that it is his treat and offering to pay, then asked for reimbursement.  That is a conflict and him breaking his word and an invitation, not a misunderstanding.", "Both my fianc\u00e9 and I got an entree that came with two sides and a soup or salad in the price range around $16 each. Plus one soda with free refills and a water. \n\nWe both don\u2019t eat huge meals so we took home the rest of our entrees after having the salads and the free chips and salsa that they serve.", "I was pretty sure NTA; This cements it.  Only thing I can maybe understand is if FBIL did not realize how much this would be on his budget, but his behavior is not reflective of that.", "I had a friend that used to do this all the time. He'd invite a bunch of people over for dinner, but then text you an hour or so before everyone was supposed to arrive asking you to pick up a whole chicken and a bag of potatoes or whatever.\n\nIt's not like he was having a potluck or anything. He just expected everyone else to supply all of the food and do most of the cooking once you got there, but he'd conveniently leave that info out until you were about to leave for his place. His apartment was also much smaller and had a less well-equipped kitchen than most everyone else's so it's also not like it was the only place we could all meet. Everyone also brought their own drinks so it seemed like he just liked the idea of getting credit for hosting a dinner party without actually being a host or supplying anything himself.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe he meant \"We can just put it on my card and settle accounts later\"", "NTA, I'd just remind everyone that FBIL's word is not even good for the price of a meal.", "NTA don\u2019t go out with FBIL again.", "I would have sent him exactly one penny.", "Right. I could understand if OP ordered a $100 steak with a bunch of a La carte sides, alcoholic drinks, AND a desert \ud83d\ude05", "This is regional. In a lot of places, everyone just pays for themselves.", "\ud83d\ude02 no kidding", "Then nta\n\nYou reasonably took him up on his offer."]}
