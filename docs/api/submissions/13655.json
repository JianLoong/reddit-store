I told him that I understood but that I really needed him to get Liza and that I'd make it up to him for interrupting.\n\nHe just angrily turned off the phone and I thought that while he was mad he had just decided to pick her up.\n\n30 minutes later I receive a call from Liza's school on where I was because the school was close to closing down and no one was there.\n\nLuckily one of Liza's friend's mother said they'd drop her off and that was all good.\n\nHowever I don't really like it when Liza goes with that particular friend, not because of the friend but because of the mother, she has this habit of asking maths questions in the car that she knows Liza is unable to answer and then criticises her over it. It's all just very mean.\n\nI called Max and asked him where he was and that he was in big trouble when he got home, he just told me that he was busy and to leave him \"the hell alone\".\n\nHe came home at around 9pm, I told him he was grounded and that he was not allowed to use the car for a good three weeks. At that he got all mad and said that it wasn't his fault I was failing as a parent and unable to afford someone to collect Liza.\n\nJust want some insight on this situation, was I being to harsh and AITA for interrupting his date?\n\nEDIT: This is the 3rd time I've asked Max to pick up his sister in the span of a year and a half. Some people are asking why I don't have a nanny, money is tight.

You\u2019re not failing as a parent. You had to work overtime, not out drinking or fucking off. Your son was in the wrong here for not helping, turning the phone off and calling you out for it.  \n\nBut you two need to talk this out and discuss expectations.

I really do. \n\n**But** the OP made arrangements that were *supposed* to work and then something dropped on his lap. Whether we like it or not, this happens. When it happens families ought to be a team. And in this case the team needed Max to go and get his sister. \n\nAgain, max is 16.

It was an exceptional work-related situation and he needed son to step up as a family member to pick up his sis.\n\nIt seems dad does his best to let his son be free, with enrolling his daughter in all sorts of activities to keep her busy until he finishes work.\n\nSon could have stepped up this one.\n\nNTA dad, and good thing you grounded your son, for his entitled behavior.", "Posts like this makes me feel hopeless for us as a society, as a species. You'll get a lot of responses from people who haven't raised kids, many still *are* kids, and they haven't been taught responsibility and family. Asking your son to help on an unexpected situation is not, and should not be, a problem. Your son's response is entitled and gross, honestly. While being disappointed at the interruption would be fine, even appropriate, having up on you is disrespectful, and refusing to help us selfish and disgusting. Like societies, family only works when everyone contributes. Your son using YOUR car is a privilege, not a right, add it's up to you too extend that or not. The hanging up on you and the disrespectful way he spoke to you is all on its own enough reason to, at the very least, suspend that privilege. You do not have to tolerate disrespect, no matter how \"upset\" he was. \n\nAlso, financial woes do not indicate how good or bad someone is at parenting, something your son is going to be painfully aware of very soon. If you give him money for allowance or anything else, help him learn by suspending that privilege as well. This is a teachable moment. Let him see they're are consequences for his choices. \n\nPlease, I implore you to ignore the ridiculous comments here that are characterizing asking for help as any other than that. You SHOULD be able to ask your family for help, including your nearly grown son. Do not listen to anyone who says otherwise. There's a difference between asking for help in an unexpected pinch and forcing him to be a regular unpaid babysitter. Do not listen to the bullshit. \n\nYou're NTA, and I hope like hell you stick to your guns about the car **privileges** being suspended. Hide behavior was selfish and disrespectful and he needs to experience consequences for that. \n\nAlso, inform your employer that you have responsibilities at home that take precedence, and you require advance notice of any extra hours required or you won't be available. They cannot expect you to scramble to find child care at the last possible moment.", "NTA\n\nReddit loves the idea of never having an ounce of responsibility toward anyone but themselves, so they'll try to call you out, but you were 100% in the right.", "Tell him you could afford to pay someone to pick her up if you didn't pay for a second car.", "Money is tight, Max mentionned how you failed because you can't afford someone to collect Liza, to stop failing as a parent you need more money so Max can forget using the car.\n\nGood job OP, NTA.", "Seeing that this is the third time in a year and a half, NTA. Sometimes shit happens, and a family has to do things they normally wouldn\u2019t do.

It\u2019s not like he\u2019s babysitting either just picking her up, that\u2019s the cost of having access to a vehicle you pay for. He sounds entitled.", "NTA.\n\nMax is being a petulant teenager. And he is a teenager, so there's that.\n\nFamily emergencies take precedence over all.  And a one-time aberration does not make you a \"failing parent.\" You are the boss, Max still lives under your roof, and he's a minor. Your reasonable request in the face of an emergency requires his compliance. In fact, even if he weren't a minor, as long as he's living under your roof, rent-free, you have the right to demand his compliance in family emergencies.\n\nYes, for his noncompliance and blatant disrespect, I think a grounding of three weeks is appropriate.\n\nHe doesn't like it? He can have his suitcase waiting by the door at midnight on his eighteenth birthday.", "NTA. I don't think you made an unreasonable request. Families have to help each other out, and I think it's wild your son thought it was okay to leave his little sister waiting for a ride home when he could have picked her up, dropped her off, and resumed his date. Plus, you also offered to make it up to him. It was a small sacrifice to make on his part, and his response was uncalled for.", "NTA.\nIt's one of those situations that pops up sometimes. It's unfortunate, but sometimes unplanned emergencie happen in families. I get your son's frustration, but he still should have gotten his sister.", "NTA you have every right to expect Max to help out in a last minute crunch situation like this. It's unfortunate he was on a date but sometimes family members have to cover for each other.", "No car, no gas money For anyone who isn\u2019t part of the family.

I think it is pretty reasonable to ask him to pick up his sister in a situation like this. I also don't think you are too harsh with his punishment. He literally ignored your request. He didn't even say he wasn't going to do it so that you could possibly try to find someone else to. And then the attitude after telling him that he was grounded? I'd add another week.", "NTA how entitled is he that he can\u2019t help firing an emergency?", "NTA. It was an emergency, and asking him to pick up his sister periodically isn't an unreasonable request when he's using your car and gas.\n\nAnd if he WASN'T going to do it, he should have made that clearer.\n\nI'd be furious too.", "Majorly NTA. He is not an adult and while that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to cater to ever beck and call of the family, he\u2019s still under your roof and has responsibilities. Sounds like a little prick.\n\nEdit: Your son sounds entitled as hell. If I\u2019m reading correctly, it\u2019s YOUR car he\u2019s using? Yea, he should\u2019ve gracefully informed girlfriend and dealt with it. What the actual fuck.", "NTA. It's your car and we're in a pinch. Time for him to buy his own car.", "NTA.  You aren't asking too much and you're in a tough situation.", "NTA\n\nsome of these comments tho\u2026", "NTA and completely shocked at a lot of these comments. It\u2019s perfectly fine to expect a 17 year old to step up occasionally in a situation like this. You\u2019ve only had to use him a few times and he\u2019s being a snot. If he wasn\u2019t using your car for his dates and social life, maybe it would be different. But having a bit of responsibility to go along with car privileges is not too much to ask of a kid whose almost an adult.", "NTA.  He sounds like an entitled brat. If you have only asked him 3 times in a year 1/2 he needs to be quiet.  Plus telling you that you are failing as a father is disrespectful and rude.  He deserves to be punished.  It is so hard for working parents to afford child care and for you to be the only one supporting the family then having your son throw that attitude around when you have rarely asked him to step up snd help is ridiculous.", "NTA \n\n3 times in 18 months is not a big deal and your daughter should not be exposed to that woman again with her bullying.", "Info: do you or your son own the car?  Is he often called to pick her up or just in times of emergency?", "NTA.  The fact that he would ignore you and speak to you the way he has is proof you haven't been firm enough.  He shouldn't get the car privileges back until he properly apologizes and learns how to talk to you and help out when needed. Let that take as long as it takes.   It could take a year and then he can move out if he is so independent.  Did I mention your wallet should be closed to all unnecessary items until that apology hits?  Oh yeah.", "NTA. Teens are difficult creatures. Hormones are raging and they are self centered. Max has absolutely no concept what it takes to run a household as a single parent. When things cool off, explain to him, as you did on this forum, that your back was against the wall when you requested his help and you wouldn\u2019t ask unless you truly needed his help. Explain, also, you have to earn a living and this, unfortunately, sometimes leaves less than ideal circumstances and burdens on him. He is 17 so offer to let him do some problem solving and ask him if he has any ideas on how to manage Liza\u2019s transportation issues should this arise again.", "NTA I'd say take that car away for good. At his age he should be aware that you're doing your best. If he's going to act like a spoiled rotten brat who can't contribute some help then take ALL his privileges away.", "NTA, if it was every other day I would have a different answer, but honestly you aren't asking for much. Who pays for the car? If he pays for it then it is his car but if you pay for it than I think it is a fair punishment.", "NTA at all.

It\u2019s not as serious as some of y\u2019all are making it out to be. \n\nSome of you apparently grew up with the luxury of not having to be a team player and help out your family occasionally. My parents provided myself and my siblings with cars/gas money, but the deal was we occasionally helped out and ran errands for them. Isn\u2019t that part of being a part of a family unit?\n\nOP said he barely asks his son to do this. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s taking advantage of him.

NTA yoir jid should be able to help.\n\nINFO: is the mother out of the picture?", "NTA. The timing sucks but this was an unexpected, rare thing. Three times in a year and a half is not that much.  If you did this all the time or had more warning it would be different, but Max should have been more understanding and responsible. And honestly if his gf wouldn\u2019t understand in this scenario, then it doesn\u2019t say much for her either or their longer term relationship prospects. \n\nHe also has no excuse for not responding for that long while still being a minor in your home. He\u2019s in your home using your car and is presumably on your phone plan. Taking responsibility when the unexpected happens is not too much to ask, especially if you followed through with some sort of compensation/making it up to him.", "Did you make sure you got paid for the overtime OP??", "NTA So is being a brat. It was an emergency I\u2019d have grounded him too.", "NTA. Son was hoping to get a little something something on his big 6 month anniversary and was pissy that you were trying to foil that plan.", "NTA\n\nYour son will soon understand this. Many teens don\u2019t understand the true value of money for most of us middle class families.

No, it isn\u2019t the teens problem, but in a family we all value each other and understand sometimes we need to pitch in to make things work. Dad\u2019s work takes precedence over most things, since I assume he doesn\u2019t work just for fun, but to provide for his family. It\u2019s not like he asks for this on daily basis, then I would say \u201clet your teen be a kid and take over the parenting role\u201d but a once in a while favor is more than perfectly acceptable.", "INFO: I see you've only asked him to pick her up 3 times in the last year. I'm curious about how often he is babysitting her or taking her to activities. How often is he watching her on nights and weekends?", "Question: why cant she walk home? Genuinely curious", "NTA. If you\u2019re not doing this often, your son should be more understanding. He could have taken his girlfriend to pick up his sister, dropped her off, and then resumed their date.

He has proven he is unreliable and cannot be trusted. \n\nDid you cuss him? Were you angry at him and that is why he cussed at you? If not and he cussed you out when he didn't get the same. Whooo wheee no car for you young man.", "NTA. You had to work overtime, you know to provide the gas for your car that he drives to dates with his little gf.

It\u2019s not like you do this often to him, you needed him and him being irresponsible wasn\u2019t going to help. It\u2019s time you sit him down and tell him he needs to get a job, his own car and grow up. My son would never say what he did to you, mine know better. Time for big boy to act like a big boy.

You're a single father trying to manage allot of things.", "NTA. I know people have this vendetta against parentifying their kids but that\u2019s not what is going on here. Being a single parent is a struggle and your intentions were not malicious. I think your son needs to be a bit more considerate. He\u2019s a teen so I get he\u2019s gonna be an ass sometimes but he\u2019s also almost an adult and he\u2019s gonna have to understand that something as silly as a 6 month anniversary will not take priority over a family member who really needs help.", "Nta. These comments I have to assume are mostly relatively spoiled younger adults and teenagers. I do not understand how so few here understand the meaning of family. Especially for emergencies. It does sound to ne like your son needs a discussion on his attitude though, his reaction was very much out of line considering all the facts you provided.", "ESH- I say the teen for throwing a hissy fit at the end, but you for not having a back up plan other then your 17yo son.   I say this as someone who was a nanny to a single mom, you need ADULT back up here. 17yo isnt able to get your daughter medical care if needed or be there if cops are around.  Ya know big events that sadly sometimes happen.\n\nTalk to your daughters friends parents, sure some might be jerks, but least she will be safe, fed and with an adult.  Your son will be gone soon, 18, he is going to blow the joint and be on his own by how he reacted.  so you need to plan now for your daughters emergency care.  Friends parents, neighbors or an on call sitter (or all).", "200% NTA, your son needs a lesson in priorities. 8 year old sister should he at the top of the list when you know no one can come get her. Keep trying OP, you are doing your best!!", "I feel for you so I\u2019m only giving a judgment on this very specific situation with YTA because that\u2019s how the bot counts the votes.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re actually an asshole but you are kind of in the wrong for this one. How many calls did you make before deciding your son was the only person who could pick up your daughter? It seems like maybe you\u2019re thinking of him as the backup parent since you said this has happened a few other times.\n\nWould you call a friend or sibling and interrupt their anniversary date for this? You might but probably only as a very last resort.\n\nI\u2019m not saying you don\u2019t respect your son but you are definitely sending him the message (even unintentionally) that you don\u2019t respect him the same as other people.\n\nIn my experience people usually like to help each other out (even kids) but people also hate being responsible for someone else\u2019s lack of planning. If the conversation went something like \u201chey Max, I\u2019m really sorry I know you\u2019re on this date but I arranged to have Mrs. Jones take Liza home in these situations but she\u2019s not there today, I already called Mom, Aunt Kathy, Uncle Tom, Mrs. Henderson, and the Smiths and nobody is available\u201d you\u2019d have had a different outcome.\n\nMaybe apologize to him and have a heart to heart about your situation as single parent, how your job can be unpredictable, and set some compromise boundaries with each other about when it\u2019s appropriate to ask for his help parenting.\n\nEdit: I misread your comment about Mom being out of the picture. Anyway good luck OP. It can be tempting to put your foot down so to speak but it the long run what you really want is a good relationship with your son and he\u2019s almost fully grown and can be out of your charge soon.", "YTA\n\nNot so much for asking Max to pick up Liza, I think that was fine. However it is a big ask to have him interrupt a date (An anniversary date, mind) when you knew you had an alternate option that you didn't try until the school contacted you.\n\nYou get the A because you punished him for an extended period of time for something that was ultimately your fault. The fact you tried *literally no one else* is inexcusable. Yes, you don't like Friend's Mom. In this particular situation you should have got over it and just contacted her anyway.", "Yes and no. So if this was an emergency, you don\u2019t expect him to always give up his life for childcare, and you would have been fired then no. If you really just expect him to give up his time all the time then yes. That said he was incredibly disrespectful to you and his sister so taking the car you pay for away is important even if you were wrong too.", "Very soft YTA. I see both sides here, and you\u2019re in a rough position and dealing with a lot.\n\nBeing a single father must be nearly impossible, and if you lose your job you lose your ability to support your kids.\n\nAt the same time, a 6 month anniversary is a big deal for anyone, but especially at 17. This wasn\u2019t just some date, this is a big relationship and life milestone with someone your son loves at an age where he\u2019s starting to build his own independent life. And him leaving in the middle doesn\u2019t just ruin the date, it puts his relationship at risk. Imagine an AITA post where a woman mentions her date leaving in the middle of their anniversary dinner. Any other date I\u2019d say your son should have left, and it\u2019d be ESH, but you put him in a really hard place.\n\nI\u2019d recommend laying off on the punishment and sitting down with your son to talk about what happened. Tell him you\u2019re sorry and that you know it\u2019s unfair when he has to step in and help. But that if you lose your job, that could put your lifestyle, house, security, etc. at risk. Also, explain how scary that\u2019d be for your daughter to not get picked up.\n\nCome up with a plan (alone) to avoid this in the future, maybe a list of sitters? Show your son the plan, and ask him to agree to step in if every step in that plan fails so that your daughter is safe. Have a backup for your backup. A safe friend\u2019s mom that you don\u2019t like beats your son leaving his date.", "YTA. \n\n> I told him that I understood but that I really needed him to get Liza and that I'd make it up to him for interrupting.\n\nHow? How *exactly* were you going to earn goodwill from his girlfriend on his behalf?", "NTA, ignore the betas saying otherwise, you should all be ashamed you rat dogs.", "NTA. He shouldn't even have to be asked, he should want to get his sister. Max is an AH for leaving his sister at her school all day after you told him you'd make it up. He's selfish and rude.", "YTA. \n\nMax is going to be an adult and out of the house soon. Then what happens if your boss springs surprise work on you? You need a backup plan that isn't Max.", "YTA.  Your older son is not a built-in backup parent. You said this is the 3rd time this has happened.  He had legitimate reasons for not doing this.  Make other arrangements if this is going to keep happening.", "Almost ESH: Your urgency is not your sons emergency. Your boss sucks for forcing you to work outside of your agreed upon hours because of situations like this that force single parents (usually women) into untenable situations. I would have a word with HR about this. You can't throw this type of parental responsibility on your son at the extreme last minute. She is not his responsibility. Apologize to him and don't ground him, you made it up in your mind that he agreed. That's not how this works. You know this deep down. Try to gather information from other parents at her school for emergency purposes like this so you never have to get a call like that again and for your daughter to feel scared for no one picking her up.", "A lot of people are going to disagree with me but YTA. Your children should not be the backup babysitter, it is incredibly unfair to them. 6 months in HS is a huge deal.  It won't be later, but for now it is.  It's not that he shouldn't help out when he can, but you have to understand why he felt his date was more important than work you weren't scheduled for since he was already out.  It doesn't matter if you find one to be of lesser importance, you're not valuing what is important to him. You should have made other arrangements.", "YTA - You\u2019ve said in comments that this happens regularly. This responsibility shouldn\u2019t be on your son. It\u2019s on *you,* the parent, to have a plan in place for times like this. Times when you work overtime and when *your son is unavailable.*\n\nYou grounded your son for your own lack of planning. *You* failed to pick up your daughter. *You* failed to have a plan in place for this situation. *You* could not advocate for yourself and your responsibility to your daughter at your place of work. *You* subjected your daughter to the uncomfortable and demeaning car ride home with the mom who asks math questions. This was all a failure on your part. A failure that you have repeated *multiple times.*\n\nYour son isn\u2019t here to pick up your slack, especially when he\u2019s already out and has plans.

In this case a 17yr old to help pick up his sister while his dad did some mandatory overtime from the sounds of it.  Ya know at the job that helps feed and cloth both his kids and that allows op to let his kid use his car for a date and probably other things as well.", "Working and providing for his 2 kids as a single parent is shirking his personal responsibility? Tell me you\u2019re a spoiled kid without telling me you\u2019re a spoiled kid!!! His son acted like an entitled spoiled kid. That\u2019s his dad car that I\u2019m sure the dad pays for gas and insurance and he couldn\u2019t even go pick up his sister??? Nah!!\u2019 Run me my keys homey! And he had the nerves to curse at his dad!!! Nah! Take your girlfriend on a date on your bike\u2026oh no I bought that too\u2026", "His personal responsibility is to feed and clothe them. That is accomplished by working. He tried to get out of the overtime. I dunno man, food and a house and clothing trumps Max and his GF.", "Nah you're right actually. Because the girlfriend is probably an entitled little shit as well. If she wasn't, she would understand that shit comes up and that they could continue to celebrate after. Like OP said in other comments... they were using HIS car that he paid the gas for to just drive around. That's all they were doing.", "Oh well. And you wonder why some parents dislike their kids! Lmbo.", "You too, with all your unnecessary hostility.", "So you don't understand \"formative experience?\" Poor thing.", "Idk where u got that the kid shouldn\u2019t be helping cause all i said was he doesn\u2019t have to pay bills, the other part is on you.", "Oh and also not allowing ur teenage kid to go out is abusive", "Not taking care of your own child rearing is shirking personal responsibility, yes. I'm sorry that's so jarring for you.", "Your offspring are not parents.", "So... Nothing. You have nothing.", "Weren\u2019t you the first one being hostile, calling the people that agreed with OP \u201cbutthurt parents?\u201d Grow up", "Ya know I asked for info cuz for all I knew he might work and pay for his own car and insurance like I did. Or maybe pitch in in other ways cuz op's family might be struggling based on his kids \"your a shitty parent\" comment. Your the one who decided to try and clap back with the random abusive comment thing and that the kid is a minor. So chill random internet person and have a great day \ud83d\udc4d", "Yet here you are", "Lmao again u said since he doesn\u2019t have to pay any bills op can stop him from going out which is abusive. The son is not obligated to pay bills. Have a nice day as well"]}
