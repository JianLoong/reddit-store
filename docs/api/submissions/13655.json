I told him that I understood but that I really needed him to get Liza and that I'd make it up to him for interrupting.\n\nHe just angrily turned off the phone and I thought that while he was mad he had just decided to pick her up.\n\n30 minutes later I receive a call from Liza's school on where I was because the school was close to closing down and no one was there.\n\nLuckily one of Liza's friend's mother said they'd drop her off and that was all good.\n\nHowever I don't really like it when Liza goes with that particular friend, not because of the friend but because of the mother, she has this habit of asking maths questions in the car that she knows Liza is unable to answer and then criticises her over it. It's all just very mean.\n\nI called Max and asked him where he was and that he was in big trouble when he got home, he just told me that he was busy and to leave him \"the hell alone\".\n\nHe came home at around 9pm, I told him he was grounded and that he was not allowed to use the car for a good three weeks. At that he got all mad and said that it wasn't his fault I was failing as a parent and unable to afford someone to collect Liza.\n\nJust want some insight on this situation, was I being to harsh and AITA for interrupting his date?\n\nEDIT: This is the 3rd time I've asked Max to pick up his sister in the span of a year and a half. Some people are asking why I don't have a nanny, money is tight.

I really do. \n\n**But** the OP made arrangements that were *supposed* to work and then something dropped on his lap. Whether we like it or not, this happens. When it happens families ought to be a team. And in this case the team needed Max to go and get his sister. \n\nAgain, max is 16.

You'll get a lot of responses from people who haven't raised kids, many still *are* kids, and they haven't been taught responsibility and family. Asking your son to help on an unexpected situation is not, and should not be, a problem. Your son's response is entitled and gross, honestly. While being disappointed at the interruption would be fine, even appropriate, having up on you is disrespectful, and refusing to help us selfish and disgusting. Like societies, family only works when everyone contributes. Your son using YOUR car is a privilege, not a right, add it's up to you too extend that or not. The hanging up on you and the disrespectful way he spoke to you is all on its own enough reason to, at the very least, suspend that privilege. You do not have to tolerate disrespect, no matter how \"upset\" he was. \n\nAlso, financial woes do not indicate how good or bad someone is at parenting, something your son is going to be painfully aware of very soon. If you give him money for allowance or anything else, help him learn by suspending that privilege as well. This is a teachable moment. Let him see they're are consequences for his choices. \n\nPlease, I implore you to ignore the ridiculous comments here that are characterizing asking for help as any other than that. You SHOULD be able to ask your family for help, including your nearly grown son. Do not listen to anyone who says otherwise. There's a difference between asking for help in an unexpected pinch and forcing him to be a regular unpaid babysitter. Do not listen to the bullshit. \n\nYou're NTA, and I hope like hell you stick to your guns about the car **privileges** being suspended. Hide behavior was selfish and disrespectful and he needs to experience consequences for that. \n\nAlso, inform your employer that you have responsibilities at home that take precedence, and you require advance notice of any extra hours required or you won't be available. They cannot expect you to scramble to find child care at the last possible moment.", "NTA\n\nReddit loves the idea of never having an ounce of responsibility toward anyone but themselves, so they'll try to call you out, but you were 100% in the right.", "Tell him you could afford to pay someone to pick her up if you didn't pay for a second car.", "Money is tight, Max mentionned how you failed because you can't afford someone to collect Liza, to stop failing as a parent you need more money so Max can forget using the car.\n\nGood job OP, NTA.", "Seeing that this is the third time in a year and a half, NTA. Sometimes shit happens, and a family has to do things they normally wouldn\u2019t do.

And he is a teenager, so there's that.\n\nFamily emergencies take precedence over all.  And a one-time aberration does not make you a \"failing parent.\" You are the boss, Max still lives under your roof, and he's a minor. Your reasonable request in the face of an emergency requires his compliance. In fact, even if he weren't a minor, as long as he's living under your roof, rent-free, you have the right to demand his compliance in family emergencies.\n\nYes, for his noncompliance and blatant disrespect, I think a grounding of three weeks is appropriate.\n\nHe doesn't like it? He can have his suitcase waiting by the door at midnight on his eighteenth birthday.", "NTA. I don't think you made an unreasonable request. Families have to help each other out, and I think it's wild your son thought it was okay to leave his little sister waiting for a ride home when he could have picked her up, dropped her off, and resumed his date. Plus, you also offered to make it up to him. It was a small sacrifice to make on his part, and his response was uncalled for.", "NTA.\nIt's one of those situations that pops up sometimes. It's unfortunate, but sometimes unplanned emergencie happen in families. I get your son's frustration, but he still should have gotten his sister.", "NTA you have every right to expect Max to help out in a last minute crunch situation like this.

I think it is pretty reasonable to ask him to pick up his sister in a situation like this. I also don't think you are too harsh with his punishment. He literally ignored your request. He didn't even say he wasn't going to do it so that you could possibly try to find someone else to. And then the attitude after telling him that he was grounded? I'd add another week.", "NTA how entitled is he that he can\u2019t help firing an emergency?", "NTA. It was an emergency, and asking him to pick up his sister periodically isn't an unreasonable request when he's using your car and gas.\n\nAnd if he WASN'T going to do it, he should have made that clearer.\n\nI'd be furious too.", "Majorly NTA. He is not an adult and while that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to cater to every beck and call of the family, he\u2019s still under your roof and has responsibilities. Sounds like a little prick.\n\nEdit: Your son sounds entitled as hell. If I\u2019m reading correctly, it\u2019s YOUR car he\u2019s using? Yea, he should\u2019ve gracefully informed girlfriend and dealt with it. What the actual fuck.", "NTA. It's your car and we're in a pinch. Time for him to buy his own car.", "NTA.  You aren't asking too much and you're in a tough situation.", "NTA\n\nsome of these comments tho\u2026", "NTA and completely shocked at a lot of these comments. It\u2019s perfectly fine to expect a 17 year old to step up occasionally in a situation like this. You\u2019ve only had to use him a few times and he\u2019s being a snot. If he wasn\u2019t using your car for his dates and social life, maybe it would be different. But having a bit of responsibility to go along with car privileges is not too much to ask of a kid whose almost an adult.", "NTA.  He sounds like an entitled brat. If you have only asked him 3 times in a year 1/2 he needs to be quiet.  Plus telling you that you are failing as a father is disrespectful and rude.  He deserves to be punished.  It is so hard for working parents to afford child care and for you to be the only one supporting the family then having your son throw that attitude around when you have rarely asked him to step up snd help is ridiculous.", "NTA \n\n3 times in 18 months is not a big deal and your daughter should not be exposed to that woman again with her bullying.", "Info: do you or your son own the car?  Is he often called to pick her up or just in times of emergency?", "NTA.  The fact that he would ignore you and speak to you the way he has is proof you haven't been firm enough.  He shouldn't get the car privileges back until he properly apologizes and learns how to talk to you and help out when needed. Let that take as long as it takes.   It could take a year and then he can move out if he is so independent.  Did I mention your wallet should be closed to all unnecessary items until that apology hits?  Oh yeah.", "NTA. Teens are difficult creatures. Hormones are raging and they are self centered. Max has absolutely no concept what it takes to run a household as a single parent. When things cool off, explain to him, as you did on this forum, that your back was against the wall when you requested his help and you wouldn\u2019t ask unless you truly needed his help. Explain, also, you have to earn a living and this, unfortunately, sometimes leaves less than ideal circumstances and burdens on him. He is 17 so offer to let him do some problem solving and ask him if he has any ideas on how to manage Liza\u2019s transportation issues should this arise again.", "NTA I'd say take that car away for good. At his age he should be aware that you're doing your best. If he's going to act like a spoiled rotten brat who can't contribute some help then take ALL his privileges away.", "NTA, if it was every other day I would have a different answer, but honestly you aren't asking for much. Who pays for the car? If he pays for it then it is his car but if you pay for it than I think it is a fair punishment.", "NTA at all.

And honestly if his gf wouldn\u2019t understand in this scenario, then it doesn\u2019t say much for her either or their longer term relationship prospects. \n\nHe also has no excuse for not responding for that long while still being a minor in your home. He\u2019s in your home using your car and is presumably on your phone plan. Taking responsibility when the unexpected happens is not too much to ask, especially if you followed through with some sort of compensation/making it up to him.", "Did you make sure you got paid for the overtime OP??", "NTA So is being a brat. It was an emergency I\u2019d have grounded him too.", "NTA. Son was hoping to get a little something something on his big 6 month anniversary and was pissy that you were trying to foil that plan.", "NTA\n\nYour son will soon understand this.

No, it isn\u2019t the teens problem, but in a family we all value each other and understand sometimes we need to pitch in to make things work. Dad\u2019s work takes precedence over most things, since I assume he doesn\u2019t work just for fun, but to provide for his family. It\u2019s not like he asks for this on daily basis, then I would say \u201clet your teen be a kid and take over the parenting role\u201d but a once in a while favor is more than perfectly acceptable.", "INFO: I see you've only asked him to pick her up 3 times in the last year.

He has proven he is unreliable and cannot be trusted. \n\nDid you cuss him? Were you angry at him and that is why he cussed at you? If not and he cussed you out when he didn't get the same.

It\u2019s time you sit him down and tell him he needs to get a job, his own car and grow up. My son would never say what he did to you, mine know better. Time for big boy to act like a big boy.

He\u2019s a teen so I get he\u2019s gonna be an ass sometimes but he\u2019s also almost an adult and he\u2019s gonna have to understand that something as silly as a 6 month anniversary will not take priority over a family member who really needs help.", "Nta. These comments I have to assume are mostly relatively spoiled younger adults and teenagers. I do not understand how so few here understand the meaning of family. Especially for emergencies.

I say this as someone who was a nanny to a single mom, you need ADULT back up here. 17yo isnt able to get your daughter medical care if needed or be there if cops are around.  Ya know big events that sadly sometimes happen.\n\nTalk to your daughters friends parents, sure some might be jerks, but least she will be safe, fed and with an adult.

However it is a big ask to have him interrupt a date (An anniversary date, mind) when you knew you had an alternate option that you didn't try until the school contacted you.\n\nYou get the A because you punished him for an extended period of time for something that was ultimately your fault. The fact you tried *literally no one else* is inexcusable. Yes, you don't like Friend's Mom. In this particular situation you should have got over it and just contacted her anyway.", "Yes and no. So if this was an emergency, you don\u2019t expect him to always give up his life for childcare, and you would have been fired then no. If you really just expect him to give up his time all the time then yes. That said he was incredibly disrespectful to you and his sister so taking the car you pay for away is important even if you were wrong too.", "Very soft YTA. I see both sides here, and you\u2019re in a rough position and dealing with a lot.\n\nBeing a single father must be nearly impossible, and if you lose your job you lose your ability to support your kids.\n\nAt the same time, a 6 month anniversary is a big deal for anyone, but especially at 17. This wasn\u2019t just some date, this is a big relationship and life milestone with someone your son loves at an age where he\u2019s starting to build his own independent life. And him leaving in the middle doesn\u2019t just ruin the date, it puts his relationship at risk. Imagine an AITA post where a woman mentions her date leaving in the middle of their anniversary dinner. Any other date I\u2019d say your son should have left, and it\u2019d be ESH, but you put him in a really hard place.\n\nI\u2019d recommend laying off on the punishment and sitting down with your son to talk about what happened. Tell him you\u2019re sorry and that you know it\u2019s unfair when he has to step in and help. But that if you lose your job, that could put your lifestyle, house, security, etc. at risk. Also, explain how scary that\u2019d be for your daughter to not get picked up.\n\nCome up with a plan (alone) to avoid this in the future, maybe a list of sitters? Show your son the plan, and ask him to agree to step in if every step in that plan fails so that your daughter is safe. Have a backup for your backup. A safe friend\u2019s mom that you don\u2019t like beats your son leaving his date.", "YTA. \n\n> I told him that I understood but that I really needed him to get Liza and that I'd make it up to him for interrupting.\n\nHow?

Make other arrangements if this is going to keep happening.", "Almost ESH: Your urgency is not your sons emergency. Your boss sucks for forcing you to work outside of your agreed upon hours because of situations like this that force single parents (usually women) into untenable situations. I would have a word with HR about this. You can't throw this type of parental responsibility on your son at the extreme last minute. She is not his responsibility. Apologize to him and don't ground him, you made it up in your mind that he agreed. That's not how this works. You know this deep down. Try to gather information from other parents at her school for emergency purposes like this so you never have to get a call like that again and for your daughter to feel scared for no one picking her up.", "A lot of people are going to disagree with me but YTA. Your children should not be the backup babysitter, it is incredibly unfair to them. 6 months in HS is a huge deal.  It won't be later, but for now it is.  It's not that he shouldn't help out when he can, but you have to understand why he felt his date was more important than work you weren't scheduled for since he was already out.  It doesn't matter if you find one to be of lesser importance, you're not valuing what is important to him. You should have made other arrangements.\n\nEdit: a lot of parents ITT saying your son was being ridiculous and entitled and calling everyone who disagreed children. I turn 38 next month and a lot of the reason why I don't have children is bc I know what it takes to raise them since I've taken care of my siblings more than my parents combined. You ghouls see children as extra labor and it shows.  This isn't helping out in an emergency, this is valuing your child's time and things they deem as important as expendable and available for your use.  Make him pay for his car and gas.

Plus, there are certain nuances in situations that need to be considered before applying this kind of thinking.

That would've been a completely reasonable stance, and wouldn't be interrupting your son's plans that he was already busy with.\n\nI understand your point. I do. But I also had to miss a big event in my teen social calendar because my parents ignored when I told them I had plans and they assigned me as their babysitter anyway; they also invited my brother's friend (their backup babysitter) with them, and told me if I wanted to go to *the plans I'd made before they had*, I had to *find and pay for a babysitter for their kid*. It's ten years later and I still remember that as completely unfair and unacceptable behaviour. Your son's six month anniversary means a lot to him right now, he had plans, *your* plans are the ones that changed, and it sounds like you didn't try to find any other solutions (even though they were clearly available - even if my suggestion above is for some reason not viable, in which case you have a truly terrible employer, you clearly could have a fellow parent pick her up, as that is what happened).\n\nSure, your son wasn't trying to help out. But you weren't trying to help him out either. To you it's just another workday, to him it's the biggest moment in his romantic life so far. You can use this as a teaching moment about how you'd like him to make sacrifices for the family, or you can use it to teach him that you can be the bigger person, see it from his side, and apologise and rescind what is arguably an over the top punishment for a situation that is ultimately your fault: your job, your plans falling through, your lack of other contingencies, your poor communication with confirming if he was actually picking her up, etc. How do you want him to remember this, and how do you want it to affect your relationship?", "Not only are you NTA, if I had pulled that, my ass would STILL be grounded and I\u2019ve been out of high school for over 20 years.", "As someone between being a full adult and teen, I feel like I can offer the input of someone who'd both understand being in that situation as a teen and the priorities an adult would understand.\n\nA date for a six month anniversary, while not something that would be pleasant to have interrupted, would not be something I'd prioritize over making sure my little sibling gets home safe. I don't have siblings myself, but if I did I would absolutely interrupt a date briefly to pick them up. I remember the few times I ended up having to wait outside after school for hours and hours when my parents couldn't pick me up and ending up being the last one left waiting, it was never nice, and having someone else who could pick me up would've made a difference, I'd never want a young sibling to go through that. \n\nThat and ultimately... it was just a six month anniversary. A significant milestone for someone his age sure, but it wasn't something like a year anniversary, and it certainly wasn't significant enough to leave his kid sister stranded and have to endure being bullied by some adult to get home. I've unexpectedly had to go with my SO to drive their younger siblings around and it never felt like it was impeding on our time, since usually it was only about a 40 minute ordeal and if anything I always enjoyed it because it made me feel like I was part of the family. Your son absolutely could've taken up that same view of the situation and stepped up to the plate by being a responsible and caring older brother. \n\nTLDR Maybe it wasn't his fault his sister ended up being stranded, but a 6 month anniversary date does not justify not taking less than an hour out of the whole night to be a good brother. Being miffed about having to do so is understandable but just abandoning his little sister is such an ass thing to do. Your punishment is perfectly fair, maybe his date or a friend will be kind enough to drive him around, not that he'd deserve it after leaving his sister behind.

Well, I'm sure his dad would rather have been home and not working overtime to help pay for that date, or the use of that car. It's amazing how everyone doesn't have a problem with the 16 yr old being mouthy when asked for a favor, when it's all on dad's dime, and it's not very often.

His little sister called me crying \ud83d\ude14 it was so heartbreaking because I'm an older sister and I gave up a lot of my 20's taking care of my sister while my mom worked. \n\nIt's what you do for family and I'm one of her biggest supporters.", "Even if he doesn\u2019t, he pays for his food and accommodation doesn\u2019t he? Man needs to work to pay for his bills. But yeah if it\u2019s for the phone too I\u2019d be ESPECIALLY mad", "I don\u2019t think he should be thinking of elaborate date do overs, he probably didn\u2019t have time to do that at work anyway. 17 or not, this kid sounds like a real piece of work. And not a good one obviously. I mean this was a safety issue too. I mean who knows who might offer this child a ride home and lets not say the school wouldn\u2019t have allowed it. We all know sometimes schools make tragic mistakes sometimes.", "Extremely too damn soft. Having spent the majority of my childhood and teen years basically raising my 4 younger siblings, this is nothing\ud83e\udd23 our parents are horrible, they're lifelong addicts that never put us before anything else, and as the oldest, I fell into that parent role al while being terrified of waking them up or somehow inconveniencing them. To this day I am still more of a mother to my siblings. I walked my sisters down the aisle because our mom was either passed out or too high/intoxicated to walk, and I was there for the birth of their children as well as helping them for a few weeks afterwards. I'm the person they call when they should be able to call our parents. That is parentification. Idfk where people are seeing that in all of these everyday chores\ud83d\ude44", "I think you\u2019ve got me wrong here. I don\u2019t think he said \u201cyou can\u2019t have a date with your gf, you need to pick up your sister\u201d.  He said \u201chey I have a bond and we need your help and I\u2019ll make it up to you\u201d\u2026 and got greeted with a turned off phone and being accused of being a failing parent. \n\nIt screams teenaged entitlement. You\u2019ve got him lacking respect to a parent as OK because he got asked for a favor?", "Right? Like if I said that to my mom, I would\u2019ve been slapped to the moon and back", "Six Month Anniversary!", "Yeah, family and friends should take care of each other, but this sub has whipped out \u201cparentification is abuse\u201d for much less. Just interesting to see the switch.", "A massive deal to a child.", "I was just thinking this too. What girl would look down on her boyfriend for being their for his sibling? Being a great older brother should be a big green flag imo.", "Since the kid has car privileges,  the car is clearly the dad's too.\n\nWhat about the date? Was it paid through the kid working or an allowance?", "Very sorry for what you went through\n\nYeah, people went too far the other way-they think any helping out is abuse now\n\nWe'd watch our little brother for hours, starting when I was only 10 (older bro 12). And we didn't even have internet yet!\n\nThese kids would have poked the horse's backside by day one if they had to endure even that. And that's not even including his actual abuse of us", "Who even cares?! Being part of a family means sometimes doing things you don't want to do, or that are inconvenient. What planet do you live on?", "Actually - you have nothing. The son didn't ask the father how he was going to make it up. There was no expectation that he would have that solution at hand. Your requirements are arbitrary and self-serving - you clearly believe you would be on the receiving end of this, and don't like the idea that you might have to help the single parent who's raising you.", "This solidifies my previous statement. I don\u2019t argue with 12 year olds. Sorry.", "If I said that to either of my parents, I\u2019d slap *myself* to the moon and back for being such a jerk", "Exactly. Have you been 17? Six months is an eternity to a child. I don\u2019t doubt that this felt like one of the most important nights of his life.", "Parentification isn't asking your older kid to pick up your younger kid a couple of times a year though. Especially when you've done everything you could to try to avoid it.", "It\u2019s so true. I\u2019m often pretty astounded at what kind of future adults are being raised- citizens that are supposed to care about society at large but who are given a ton of latitude to refuse to be on their own family\u2019s team.", "> this sub has whipped out \u201cparentification is abuse\u201d for much less\n\nAnd they\u2019ve been wrong in those cases.", "More important than family right.  For a relationship that probably won\u2019t last?", "That's a great point as well. Maybe he didn't tell her? But if she knew and was OK with how he was handling the situation, big red flag", "So that's a \"yes\"", "I agree, and neither are the many lesser things that this sub has called parentification. But as a parent, if I were making a cost-benefit analysis between asking one child to cancel an extremely important night that he had likely put time, money and effort into, and asking the other child to answer math questions, I would just go with the math questions.", "\u201cYou don\u2019t owe anyone anything\u201d logic is a pervasive cancer", "I agree.", "Yes, most high school relationships don\u2019t last, that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t extremely important and formative to the people involved in them. It\u2019s surprising that people can\u2019t find any sympathy for that.", "So the father says no to working late. He could lose his job but he can now be home to pick/drop off the 8 year old. Working and providing for your children are vital and sometimes as parents we have to make a hard decision. The father was in a hard place. A 17 year old should be old enough to understand that sometimes in life we have to do things we don\u2019t want to do. That\u2019s a part of being in a family! But hey since you\u2019re 12, you wouldn\u2019t know anything about that. It\u2019s Friday you probably have your hand out for your allowance that you feel you\u2019re owed!", "So the answer is yes - you are spoiled child. I'm asking for a second you work on a farm. You're going to be expected to help, and from a young age. And that's good. You show so much undeserved privilege it's embarrassing. For you. I'm sure you don't see it - you're in the privilege bubble."]}
