I told him that I understood but that I really needed him to get Liza and that I'd make it up to him for interrupting.\n\nHe just angrily turned off the phone and I thought that while he was mad he had just decided to pick her up.\n\n30 minutes later I receive a call from Liza's school on where I was because the school was close to closing down and no one was there.\n\nLuckily one of Liza's friend's mother said they'd drop her off and that was all good.\n\nHowever I don't really like it when Liza goes with that particular friend, not because of the friend but because of the mother, she has this habit of asking maths questions in the car that she knows Liza is unable to answer and then criticises her over it. It's all just very mean.\n\nI called Max and asked him where he was and that he was in big trouble when he got home, he just told me that he was busy and to leave him \"the hell alone\".\n\nHe came home at around 9pm, I told him he was grounded and that he was not allowed to use the car for a good three weeks. At that he got all mad and said that it wasn't his fault I was failing as a parent and unable to afford someone to collect Liza.\n\nJust want some insight on this situation, was I being to harsh and AITA for interrupting his date?\n\nEDIT: This is the 3rd time I've asked Max to pick up his sister in the span of a year and a half. Some people are asking why I don't have a nanny, money is tight.

I really do. \n\n**But** the OP made arrangements that were *supposed* to work and then something dropped on his lap. Whether we like it or not, this happens. When it happens families ought to be a team. And in this case the team needed Max to go and get his sister. \n\nAgain, max is 16.

It was an exceptional work-related situation and he needed son to step up as a family member to pick up his sis.\n\nIt seems dad does his best to let his son be free, with enrolling his daughter in all sorts of activities to keep her busy until he finishes work.\n\nSon could have stepped up this one.\n\nNTA dad, and good thing you grounded your son, for his entitled behavior.", "Posts like this makes me feel hopeless for us as a society, as a species. You'll get a lot of responses from people who haven't raised kids, many still *are* kids, and they haven't been taught responsibility and family. Asking your son to help on an unexpected situation is not, and should not be, a problem. Your son's response is entitled and gross, honestly. While being disappointed at the interruption would be fine, even appropriate, hanging up on you is disrespectful, and refusing to help is selfish and disgusting. Like societies, family only works when everyone contributes. Your son using YOUR car is a privilege, not a right, and it's up to you to extend that privilege to him... or not. The hanging up on you and the disrespectful way he spoke to you is all on its own enough reason to, at the very least, suspend that privilege. You do not have to tolerate disrespect, no matter how \"upset\" he was. \n\nAlso, financial woes do not indicate how good or bad someone is at parenting, something your son is going to be painfully aware of very soon. If you give him money for allowance or anything else, help him learn by suspending that privilege as well. This is a teachable moment. Let him see there are consequences for his choices. \n\nPlease, I implore you to ignore the ridiculous comments here that are characterizing asking for help as any other than that. You SHOULD be able to ask your family for help, including your nearly grown son. Do not listen to anyone who says otherwise. There's a difference between asking for help in an unexpected pinch and forcing him to be a regular unpaid babysitter. Do not listen to the bullshit. \n\nYou're NTA, and I hope like hell you stick to your guns about the car **privileges** being suspended. Hide behavior was selfish and disrespectful and he needs to experience consequences for that. \n\nAlso, inform your employer that you have responsibilities at home that take precedence, and you require advance notice of any extra hours required or you won't be available. They cannot expect you to scramble to find child care at the last possible moment.", "NTA\n\nReddit loves the idea of never having an ounce of responsibility toward anyone but themselves, so they'll try to call you out, but you were 100% in the right.", "Tell him you could afford to pay someone to pick her up if you didn't pay for a second car.", "Money is tight, Max mentionned how you failed because you can't afford someone to collect Liza, to stop failing as a parent you need more money so Max can forget using the car.\n\nGood job OP, NTA.", "Seeing that this is the third time in a year and a half, NTA. Sometimes shit happens, and a family has to do things they normally wouldn\u2019t do.

And he is a teenager, so there's that.\n\nFamily emergencies take precedence over all.  And a one-time aberration does not make you a \"failing parent.\" You are the boss, Max still lives under your roof, and he's a minor. Your reasonable request in the face of an emergency requires his compliance. In fact, even if he weren't a minor, as long as he's living under your roof, rent-free, you have the right to demand his compliance in family emergencies.\n\nYes, for his noncompliance and blatant disrespect, I think a grounding of three weeks is appropriate.\n\nHe doesn't like it? He can have his suitcase waiting by the door at midnight on his eighteenth birthday.", "NTA. I don't think you made an unreasonable request. Families have to help each other out, and I think it's wild your son thought it was okay to leave his little sister waiting for a ride home when he could have picked her up, dropped her off, and resumed his date. Plus, you also offered to make it up to him. It was a small sacrifice to make on his part, and his response was uncalled for.", "NTA.\nIt's one of those situations that pops up sometimes. It's unfortunate, but sometimes unplanned emergencie happen in families. I get your son's frustration, but he still should have gotten his sister.", "NTA you have every right to expect Max to help out in a last minute crunch situation like this.

I think it is pretty reasonable to ask him to pick up his sister in a situation like this. I also don't think you are too harsh with his punishment. He literally ignored your request. He didn't even say he wasn't going to do it so that you could possibly try to find someone else to. And then the attitude after telling him that he was grounded? I'd add another week.", "NTA how entitled is he that he can\u2019t help firing an emergency?", "NTA. It was an emergency, and asking him to pick up his sister periodically isn't an unreasonable request when he's using your car and gas.\n\nAnd if he WASN'T going to do it, he should have made that clearer.\n\nI'd be furious too.", "Majorly NTA. He is not an adult and while that doesn\u2019t mean he needs to cater to every beck and call of the family, he\u2019s still under your roof and has responsibilities. Sounds like a little prick.\n\nEdit: Your son sounds entitled as hell. If I\u2019m reading correctly, it\u2019s YOUR car he\u2019s using? Yea, he should\u2019ve gracefully informed girlfriend and dealt with it. What the actual fuck.", "NTA. It's your car and we're in a pinch. Time for him to buy his own car.", "NTA.  You aren't asking too much and you're in a tough situation.", "NTA\n\nsome of these comments tho\u2026", "NTA and completely shocked at a lot of these comments. It\u2019s perfectly fine to expect a 17 year old to step up occasionally in a situation like this. You\u2019ve only had to use him a few times and he\u2019s being a snot. If he wasn\u2019t using your car for his dates and social life, maybe it would be different. But having a bit of responsibility to go along with car privileges is not too much to ask of a kid whose almost an adult.", "NTA.  He sounds like an entitled brat. If you have only asked him 3 times in a year 1/2 he needs to be quiet.  Plus telling you that you are failing as a father is disrespectful and rude.  He deserves to be punished.  It is so hard for working parents to afford child care and for you to be the only one supporting the family then having your son throw that attitude around when you have rarely asked him to step up snd help is ridiculous.", "NTA \n\n3 times in 18 months is not a big deal and your daughter should not be exposed to that woman again with her bullying.", "Info: do you or your son own the car?  Is he often called to pick her up or just in times of emergency?", "NTA.  The fact that he would ignore you and speak to you the way he has is proof you haven't been firm enough.  He shouldn't get the car privileges back until he properly apologizes and learns how to talk to you and help out when needed. Let that take as long as it takes.   It could take a year and then he can move out if he is so independent.  Did I mention your wallet should be closed to all unnecessary items until that apology hits?  Oh yeah.", "NTA. Teens are difficult creatures. Hormones are raging and they are self centered. Max has absolutely no concept what it takes to run a household as a single parent. When things cool off, explain to him, as you did on this forum, that your back was against the wall when you requested his help and you wouldn\u2019t ask unless you truly needed his help. Explain, also, you have to earn a living and this, unfortunately, sometimes leaves less than ideal circumstances and burdens on him. He is 17 so offer to let him do some problem solving and ask him if he has any ideas on how to manage Liza\u2019s transportation issues should this arise again.", "NTA I'd say take that car away for good. At his age he should be aware that you're doing your best. If he's going to act like a spoiled rotten brat who can't contribute some help then take ALL his privileges away.", "NTA, if it was every other day I would have a different answer, but honestly you aren't asking for much. Who pays for the car? If he pays for it then it is his car but if you pay for it than I think it is a fair punishment.", "NTA at all.

Three times in a year and a half is not that much.  If you did this all the time or had more warning it would be different, but Max should have been more understanding and responsible. And honestly if his gf wouldn\u2019t understand in this scenario, then it doesn\u2019t say much for her either or their longer term relationship prospects. \n\nHe also has no excuse for not responding for that long while still being a minor in your home. He\u2019s in your home using your car and is presumably on your phone plan. Taking responsibility when the unexpected happens is not too much to ask, especially if you followed through with some sort of compensation/making it up to him.", "Did you make sure you got paid for the overtime OP??", "NTA So is being a brat. It was an emergency I\u2019d have grounded him too.", "NTA. Son was hoping to get a little something something on his big 6 month anniversary and was pissy that you were trying to foil that plan.", "NTA\n\nYour son will soon understand this. Many teens don\u2019t understand the true value of money for most of us middle class families.

No, it isn\u2019t the teens problem, but in a family we all value each other and understand sometimes we need to pitch in to make things work. Dad\u2019s work takes precedence over most things, since I assume he doesn\u2019t work just for fun, but to provide for his family. It\u2019s not like he asks for this on daily basis, then I would say \u201clet your teen be a kid and take over the parenting role\u201d but a once in a while favor is more than perfectly acceptable.", "INFO: I see you've only asked him to pick her up 3 times in the last year.

He has proven he is unreliable and cannot be trusted. \n\nDid you cuss him? Were you angry at him and that is why he cussed at you? If not and he cussed you out when he didn't get the same.

It\u2019s not like you do this often to him, you needed him and him being irresponsible wasn\u2019t going to help. It\u2019s time you sit him down and tell him he needs to get a job, his own car and grow up. My son would never say what he did to you, mine know better. Time for big boy to act like a big boy.

He\u2019s a teen so I get he\u2019s gonna be an ass sometimes but he\u2019s also almost an adult and he\u2019s gonna have to understand that something as silly as a 6 month anniversary will not take priority over a family member who really needs help.", "Nta. These comments I have to assume are mostly relatively spoiled younger adults and teenagers. I do not understand how so few here understand the meaning of family. Especially for emergencies.

I say this as someone who was a nanny to a single mom, you need ADULT back up here. 17yo isnt able to get your daughter medical care if needed or be there if cops are around.  Ya know big events that sadly sometimes happen.\n\nTalk to your daughters friends parents, sure some might be jerks, but least she will be safe, fed and with an adult.

Friends parents, neighbors or an on call sitter (or all).", "200% NTA, your son needs a lesson in priorities. 8 year old sister should he at the top of the list when you know no one can come get her. Keep trying OP, you are doing your best!!", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nNot so much for asking Max to pick up Liza, I think that was fine. However it is a big ask to have him interrupt a date (An anniversary date, mind) when you knew you had an alternate option that you didn't try until the school contacted you.\n\nYou get the A because you punished him for an extended period of time for something that was ultimately your fault. The fact you tried *literally no one else* is inexcusable. Yes, you don't like Friend's Mom. In this particular situation you should have got over it and just contacted her anyway.", "Yes and no. So if this was an emergency, you don\u2019t expect him to always give up his life for childcare, and you would have been fired then no. If you really just expect him to give up his time all the time then yes. That said he was incredibly disrespectful to you and his sister so taking the car you pay for away is important even if you were wrong too.", "Very soft YTA. I see both sides here, and you\u2019re in a rough position and dealing with a lot.\n\nBeing a single father must be nearly impossible, and if you lose your job you lose your ability to support your kids.\n\nAt the same time, a 6 month anniversary is a big deal for anyone, but especially at 17. This wasn\u2019t just some date, this is a big relationship and life milestone with someone your son loves at an age where he\u2019s starting to build his own independent life. And him leaving in the middle doesn\u2019t just ruin the date, it puts his relationship at risk. Imagine an AITA post where a woman mentions her date leaving in the middle of their anniversary dinner. Any other date I\u2019d say your son should have left, and it\u2019d be ESH, but you put him in a really hard place.\n\nI\u2019d recommend laying off on the punishment and sitting down with your son to talk about what happened. Tell him you\u2019re sorry and that you know it\u2019s unfair when he has to step in and help. But that if you lose your job, that could put your lifestyle, house, security, etc. at risk. Also, explain how scary that\u2019d be for your daughter to not get picked up.\n\nCome up with a plan (alone) to avoid this in the future, maybe a list of sitters? Show your son the plan, and ask him to agree to step in if every step in that plan fails so that your daughter is safe. Have a backup for your backup. A safe friend\u2019s mom that you don\u2019t like beats your son leaving his date.", "YTA. \n\n> I told him that I understood but that I really needed him to get Liza and that I'd make it up to him for interrupting.\n\nHow?

Your older son is not a built-in backup parent. You said this is the 3rd time this has happened.  He had legitimate reasons for not doing this.  Make other arrangements if this is going to keep happening.", "Almost ESH: Your urgency is not your sons emergency. Your boss sucks for forcing you to work outside of your agreed upon hours because of situations like this that force single parents (usually women) into untenable situations. I would have a word with HR about this. You can't throw this type of parental responsibility on your son at the extreme last minute. She is not his responsibility. Apologize to him and don't ground him, you made it up in your mind that he agreed. That's not how this works. You know this deep down. Try to gather information from other parents at her school for emergency purposes like this so you never have to get a call like that again and for your daughter to feel scared for no one picking her up.", "A lot of people are going to disagree with me but YTA. Your children should not be the backup babysitter, it is incredibly unfair to them. 6 months in HS is a huge deal.  It won't be later, but for now it is.  It's not that he shouldn't help out when he can, but you have to understand why he felt his date was more important than work you weren't scheduled for since he was already out.  It doesn't matter if you find one to be of lesser importance, you're not valuing what is important to him. You should have made other arrangements.\n\nEdit: a lot of parents ITT saying your son was being ridiculous and entitled and calling everyone who disagreed children. I turn 38 next month and a lot of the reason why I don't have children is bc I know what it takes to raise them since I've taken care of my siblings more than my parents combined. You ghouls see children as extra labor and it shows.  This isn't helping out in an emergency, this is valuing your child's time and things they deem as important as expendable and available for your use.  Make him pay for his car and gas.

Plus, there are certain nuances in situations that need to be considered before applying this kind of thinking.

That would've been a completely reasonable stance, and wouldn't be interrupting your son's plans that he was already busy with.\n\nI understand your point. I do. But I also had to miss a big event in my teen social calendar because my parents ignored when I told them I had plans and they assigned me as their babysitter anyway; they also invited my brother's friend (their backup babysitter) with them, and told me if I wanted to go to *the plans I'd made before they had*, I had to *find and pay for a babysitter for their kid*. It's ten years later and I still remember that as completely unfair and unacceptable behaviour. Your son's six month anniversary means a lot to him right now, he had plans, *your* plans are the ones that changed, and it sounds like you didn't try to find any other solutions (even though they were clearly available - even if my suggestion above is for some reason not viable, in which case you have a truly terrible employer, you clearly could have a fellow parent pick her up, as that is what happened).\n\nSure, your son wasn't trying to help out. But you weren't trying to help him out either. To you it's just another workday, to him it's the biggest moment in his romantic life so far. You can use this as a teaching moment about how you'd like him to make sacrifices for the family, or you can use it to teach him that you can be the bigger person, see it from his side, and apologise and rescind what is arguably an over the top punishment for a situation that is ultimately your fault: your job, your plans falling through, your lack of other contingencies, your poor communication with confirming if he was actually picking her up, etc. How do you want him to remember this, and how do you want it to affect your relationship?", "Not only are you NTA, if I had pulled that, my ass would STILL be grounded and I\u2019ve been out of high school for over 20 years.", "As someone between being a full adult and teen, I feel like I can offer the input of someone who'd both understand being in that situation as a teen and the priorities an adult would understand.\n\nA date for a six month anniversary, while not something that would be pleasant to have interrupted, would not be something I'd prioritize over making sure my little sibling gets home safe. I don't have siblings myself, but if I did I would absolutely interrupt a date briefly to pick them up. I remember the few times I ended up having to wait outside after school for hours and hours when my parents couldn't pick me up and ending up being the last one left waiting, it was never nice, and having someone else who could pick me up would've made a difference, I'd never want a young sibling to go through that. \n\nThat and ultimately... it was just a six month anniversary. A significant milestone for someone his age sure, but it wasn't something like a year anniversary, and it certainly wasn't significant enough to leave his kid sister stranded and have to endure being bullied by some adult to get home. I've unexpectedly had to go with my SO to drive their younger siblings around and it never felt like it was impeding on our time, since usually it was only about a 40 minute ordeal and if anything I always enjoyed it because it made me feel like I was part of the family. Your son absolutely could've taken up that same view of the situation and stepped up to the plate by being a responsible and caring older brother. \n\nTLDR Maybe it wasn't his fault his sister ended up being stranded, but a 6 month anniversary date does not justify not taking less than an hour out of the whole night to be a good brother. Being miffed about having to do so is understandable but just abandoning his little sister is such an ass thing to do. Your punishment is perfectly fair, maybe his date or a friend will be kind enough to drive him around, not that he'd deserve it after leaving his sister behind.

Well, I'm sure his dad would rather have been home and not working overtime to help pay for that date, or the use of that car. It's amazing how everyone doesn't have a problem with the 16 yr old being mouthy when asked for a favor, when it's all on dad's dime, and it's not very often.

On the other hand, he\u2019s 17. I was 17 once, I get it, seems like the world is out to get you and you never have time to just do what you want. But such is the way of life. \n\nI would also sit him down and let him know that (Assuming this is the US) leaving your kid at school with no ride is a good way to get CPS involved and that will have an immediate effect on ***him*** as well, and not a good one at that. \n\nYou had a one off task that forced you to work overtime and the options were \u201cstay at work so we can pay rent\u201d or potentially lose your job because your son was being self centered.

I could see myself in his exact position when I was 17 and it probably would have played out the exact same as this did.

You potentially left your 8 year old in danger because of this assumption. Your son is acting immaturely but he IS a teenager still so it's your responsibility to keep that in mind and help him mature.\n\nI do need a bit more info though: did you know your son had this event planned today? Because if you did YTA for not having a contingency plan on a day where both people who could pick up your 8yr old could potentially be busy with something important. I really do think you should have contacted someone else (family friends? Trusted neighbour? A different friends mum?)  \n\n\nAlso, do you have a pattern of disrupting important things for your son?

I wonder if the son even tried to talk to his gf and see if it's okay if they can reschedule the date or even maybe do something at the house like watch a movie or something. I dont think he should have responded like that and if his girlfriend breaks up with him over this, then maybe she wasnt the right one. Also....Why do redditors automatically go to \"why don't you have a nanny?\" Or even a babysitter. Not everyone can afford one. Maybe there's a reason why they don't have one. \nYes I get annoyed when my mom asked me to go pick up my brother but if she literally couldn't get off of work, I'd go.", "Gen X here.\n\nMy father would have knocked the shit outta me if I *ever* hung up the phone on him. \n\n\\~just sayin'", "Oh, teenagers... you can barely live with them but can't kick them out. (Kidding). This got long and I'm giving advice you didn't ask for, but even just your short message here made me feel for you. Your son should be given more responsibility if he acted out over that small of a favor.\n\nNTA, you didn't do anything wrong here. You weren't out partying. You were working and could not get away. Honestly, I would put him in charge of picking her up at least once or twice per week. He needs to learn that the real world sometimes calls.\n\nYou're a single dad with a 17 year old. There's no reason he can't help out. Hell, I'm married with two in their early 20s and we ALWAYS expected them to do things for the good of the family sometimes. That's just how family works. \n\nMy daughter likes to cook, so she does most of the cooking (heck she's been cooking since she was able to reach the stove). My son doesn't mind dealing with the recycling (I'm all about green, but at some point I just get sick of the damn bins everywhere and want to just throw it away), so he makes sure the recycling is dealt with properly. EVERYONE hates to do clean the bathroom so we have kind of an unwritten rotation, that someone deals with it once per week. Everyone does their own laundry.\n\nI would tell his smart little ass (that you love unconditionally, just a reminder LOL) that you may be failing as a parent, but he is seriously failing as a big brother and member of the family if he cannot go get his sister when you're working late. That car would sit in the driveway for a week and he would walk to school. I realize it was an important night for him, but sometimes shit happens.\n\nSorry, I know this makes me sound like a hard ass and I'm really not, hell the kids say I'm a pushover, but there ARE expectations for being part of the family. And I really hate when kids act over entitled. I don't want my kids to be worrywarts, but I also want them to be prepared for the real world out there.\n\nIn your case, you might have gone overboard with the 3 weeks no car thing. BUT... this is what I would do... I would sit down and tell him that he's 17 and that you've avoided asking him for help because you know he's a kid and you absolutely want him to have fun and do kid things, but that the family really needs him to help out more. You and they are getting older and that means there's a lot more responsibilities and he needs to step up. Ask him to pick up his sister once or twice per week. Show your daughter how to do laundry and have her do her own AND the household towels or something. Let them be a part of the solution.\n\nNow, the punishment... since you aren't really asking him to do this on a regular basis, I'd use this situation as a reset. Talk to him like I said about but then make sure he knows that there has to be ramifications for his behavior because the job you do puts food on the table and keeps the lights on. What would he think happens if you are fired? Tell him that for the next 7 days that car is YOUR car. He has permission to take it to school, to his sister's school and home. If you need an errand you want him to do, he can use it then, but that's it.\n\nAs the kids got older, we brought them more into the family goings on. They know how much we make, they know how much the mortgage is, how much the cars are, etc. When things are tight, we tell them - hey, it's frozen pizza this Friday instead of delivery. When things are good, it's \"Momma got a bonus, we're going out!\" LOL. But seriously, as they got older, we just made them a part of larger conversations. They are allowed to voice their opinion but we get final say. For instance, let's say husband gets  a nice bonus and wants to use it to buy a video game console and some games but I want to stash it away for vacation. We bring them in at dinner and get their opinion. They live here too AND they get to hear us compromise (okay, let's save half of it for vacation and the other half you can get the console, but just two games for now) or WHATEVER. Honestly, most of this stuff seems to always take place during dinner - probably because it's the ONE time each day I can get everyone in one place face to face :)\n\nI think it's important that kids understand how things work. Keep it age appropriate, of course. Mine now each have their own checking accounts and own money. One doesn't work because he's disabled and the other is in school full time and is really enjoying taking that extra time to spend on her studies without the stress of work added. That is something we were able to do for her. Doing this also made it easier for us to transition to them being adults. They are respectful, loving and down to earth young adults in their early 20s. My son will likely always live at home, he's schizophrenic and while I hope he's able to get his meds to where he can live a semi normal life, it's been a hard four years just getting him to where he is now. And that's ok. He's actually a great roommate. Oh, he pisses us off sometimes, but he's still our kid. Our daughter is the most responsible 20 year old you will ever meet. I'm not saying we did everything right. I'm sure we gave them plenty to talk about with future counselors, but that's just my unsolicited opinion.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Your son doesn't have enough responsibilities if he acted out, this is your JOB on the line - what feeds him. I think you should take this time to bring more responsibilities out to both of them. If he acted up just for you asking that, it leads me to believe that you may be one of those trying to do it all yourself. Don't do that. Let them help. You're a family unit.", "The car? Belongs legally to who? If the answer is not Max you have your lever. My kids used my car but it was \u201cdads car\u201d. At no time did they ever consider the the car was \u201c theirs\u201d.

Yes she ended up being okay, but being criticized about a subject she struggles with is never okay.

Liza is *only 8 years old,* that kind of criticism can severely damage a child\u2019s self esteem.\n\nMax could\u2019ve easily picked up his sister, drop her off home, and continue the date? Or at least continue the date at his house? If I was the date, I\u2019d be worried for my partner\u2019s little sibling if she didn\u2019t have a ride home.

How selfish. Being pissed at your dad is one thing- ditching your kid sister and leaving her by herself is a whole different story.

My parents were and still all very supportive of me, too, and we just were taught that we all had to help out. I wasn\u2019t being their parent. I was being part of a family.

Because like you, she\u2019s doing great things", "That is what they\u2019re saying", "Don't ya know everyone on Reddit has nanny money? It seems like everyone has 'great jobs in tech' or a trust or crazy inheritance or 6 figure salaries. I've never hung out with so many rich people in my life.", "The same people suggesting OP get a nanny are the same people on r/ChoosingBeggars complaining that people want full-time nannies for ridiculously low salaries.\n\nPS - nannies, babysitters, and so on deserve to be paid properly for their work. Looking after children is a hard and laborious job.", "Even if it happened once a month, I'd expect my son to be there for his little sister when I'm out at a job so he can have a roof, clothes, food and a car... incredibly ungrateful of the son to drop it like that", ">he shouldn\u2019t have waited til 6 and figured out transportation earlier\n\nI could be wrong, but it reads to me like the boss was telling OP to stay late around then", "> It sounds like he didn\u2019t even know his son was on an anniversary date? Not cool.\n\nThat's going to entirely depend on how open the son is with dad. He's 16, they're kind of famous for walling themselves off, especially about 'embarrassing' stuff like girls.\n\nIn a perfect world, OP's boss would have been understanding, let him go for the day, and call it pat. We don't live in a perfect world, where even if the boss is being an ass OP can just walk out of the thing that puts clothes on their backs and a roof over their heads and into another.", "He is a single dad! These kids expect to have a say in everything. My generation did what they were told and if you talked back there were definitely consequences. I wouldn't even question in my mind if I had to something for my sisters because I love them. Son IS TAH. You don't talk to your parents like that. Dad is right you and son are wrong.", "Hold the fort. This kid get to use the car. I bet dad pays his car insurance too. That more than makes up for everything. Kids are so spoiled these days.", "Not for a teen who wasn't at work and had no other responsibilities at the time.", "Cool. WiFi password protected, loaf of bread, jar of mayo, bottle of mustard, cheese slices, bag of apples, a bunch of bananas, box of powdered milk and bag of Malt-O-Meal \u201cToasty Ohs\u201d it is. Cause that\u2019s all we can afford if I get suspended from work for a week because you can\u2019t help out once or twice a year.", "You keep disagreeing with a point no one is making. Just stop", "And offered to make it up to his son (not sure what that consists of or the follow through) but he clearly knew it was an inconvenience, like, he\u2019s a single dad of two, you\u2019d think his son could help him out THREE TIMES A YEAR. My goodness.", "The son could\u2019ve been a family player but he is 17, his priority is himself. Not really surprised. Agree it\u2019s shitty behavior but I was pretty shitty and self absorbed at 17 too. \n\nThe true AH is the boss. People need work/life balance and if no one else was capable of finishing whatever project besides OP, his boss should\u2019ve stepped up. Sometimes being a leader means taking care of things rather than shoving it all on your team. Especially if OP is usually on top of their workload and overall a good employee.", "The kid is 17 yo, part of his chores could he picking up his sister and I wouldn't think his dad was taking advantage. I had a ton of responsibilities when I was 17, even if I don't have siblings to look after, I can totally see my mom asking me to pick up my younger sister from school.", "Then you clearly can\u2019t read", "They don\u2019t apply to his son in this situation because work issue came up. He not only turned off his phone he left his 8 year old sister waiting to be picked up for at least 30 minutes. \n\nSo Dad is paying for his car, (obviously since he revoked driving privileges) and I\u2019m assuming his phone. He apparently feels entitled enough that he can ignore his Dad request, turn off his phone and saunter in three hours later. Then we see how disrespectful he is when he told his Dad he is failing as a parent and \u201cit\u2019s not my problem you can\u2019t afford somebody to pick up Lisa\u201d. If I had pulled any of this shit as a teenager I would have lost my life lol.\n\nThat said: I am wondering what the dynamic is here that his son felt that it was acceptable to turn off his phone, not pick up his sister, and then further disrespect  his Dad by saying those things to him. It sounds like perhaps he is pretty self entitled and has possibly gotten away with a lot prior to this.\n\nNTA", "The kid IS an asshole. Not only did he abandon his sister, but he told his father, who was at work, that he was \"failing\" as a parent because he doesnt have tons of money to dish out on nannies.\n\nAsshole behavior.", "BTW, it's not an anniversary. It's a half-a-versary.", "6 MONTH ANNIVERSARY. It's not even a real anniversary. It's an excuse for the kid to get laid.", "Exactly! The just extreme selfishness of these future adults is f****** wild. I was 16 and my parents each worked full time, they gave me a car, paid for the insurance, and paid for the gas, I could pretty much use it at my full discretion, this was like a 40k car too btw. When I got out of school I picked up my little sister, everyday. It\u2019s not parentification to pull your weight and assist in helping the family. As an older brother I\u2019m supposed to help assist and protect my sisters. Though I will say I\u2019m lucky enough to have a loving family that I just want to be a part of and pull my weight in, not everyone is so lucky.", "I mean, maybe. They could have also just ordered dinner at a sit-down restaurant, or just had it brought out to their table and maybe the meal was a splurge. Is the dad gonna give him $45 for dinner? The place could have been a bit of a drive away, he could have just bought movie tickets and been waiting to go in, they could have been doing a lot of things that are not so simple to just go spend a chunk of time driving to pick up the sister, driving her home, then driving back to their date. That's if he could have even left her, his night may have then been about watching his 8 year old sister because who leaves a kid that young home alone?\n\nNot saying he's in the right, but it isn't necessarily all that simple either. He's 17 and on what at that age is a pretty important date. He wasn't in the right here, but his feelings are understandable.", "People forget what's it's like to be a teenager. And it's probably even worse in the social media era.", "In Wish a nannie = an old furbie and some tictacs.", "For real. If I ever said that to my parents, I would fully expect my car privileges (that\u2019s right, privileges, not rights) to be revoked indefinitely.", "I sincerely feel like a lot of kids read things like 'parentification' on Reddit and conflate it with 'helping my parents care for my sibling that one time.' Or gaslighting; that's a term which has seen a lot of exercise. They genuinely don't understand what these words mean and the severe situations they relate to. \n\nThe son is definitely the AH, but I feel that OP could benefit from having a proper conversation with him.", "Exactly. The kids not an AH for going out on his anniversary or for being upset about it. But he is 100% the AH for how he disrespected his father afterwards.", "There\u2019s no such thing! People create nonsensical traditions all the time that only matter to them for a Myriad of reasons.\n\nAnniversaries only matter after at least a year.

I totally get how toiling it could be but it seems like this isn\u2019t a constant thing which was something I was use to.\n\nHowever I regard my father in the highest of ways because I see how hard he\u2019s working, how much of himself he puts in to single handly raise  and provide for 3 children financially & more.\n\nIdk how new this is, cause it is rough at the beginning, so I really hope as op gets older he realizes how much his father is most likely doing for them.", "> it\u2019s hilarious that people are acting like he had any right to be such a dick about it\n\nAbsolutely agree, only I think it's really sad, and stupid.

It\u2019s about facing the reality of life that dads a single parent with one income who needs his job to provide them with a roof over their head. He can\u2019t afford a regular babysitter or nanny, doesn\u2019t often ask for his sons help, and son should take into consideration that dad needs to keep his job to pay those bills so maybe just go pick up your sister so that dads boss don\u2019t Chuck a shit. Boss put dad in a bad position. Help him out.
