Poor brothers.\n\nGet off your self-righteous high horse.", "YTA - your brother was a teenager doing stupid teenager things and you keep calling him a \"criminal\" as if he mugged an old lady or shot someone. I almost couldn't believe this post because how can you really get that hell bent over WEED? Maybe it's because I'm from Canada, where weed is legal and the most a minor would get for being caught with weed is a slap on the wrist (if that) or a ticket if it's found in a car, but it is absolutely ridiculous to go no contact with your BROTHER for having weed when he was 16.

I don\u2019t agree with the way your parents handled it when he was first sent to prison, and I think it was sweet your other brother was trying to look out for his MINOR brother whose parents had written him off. It is great that your parents are slowly welcoming them both back into their lives, and for you and your extended family to be so grudge-holding and unforgiving even AFTER he has served his time, then you all are horrible people and I hope you make a mistake and get abandoned by every person in your life too.", "YTA dude its weed! everybody smokes weed", "oh my god. YTA. Your family is TA too. You\u2019re gonna give a 16 year old a life sentence for simple possession?

I'm guessing you never visited either.\n\nYour brother must have been scared to death. He must have felt so abandoned and thrown away. Given the way you and your parents work, I'm guessing he's still feeling that way. You seem to want to make sure he knows he's garbage.\n\nHe will likely never recover from the trauma of being incarcerated and abandoned by his family.\n\nYou are not a good person. Neither are your parents.", "There's a reason why 16 year olds are incarcerated as juveniles. They are most certainly not, from a wide perspective, considered the same as adults. The entire premise of the juvenile system is to provide a second chance when they are older.
