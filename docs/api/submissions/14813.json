Sure, failing to treat your son's GF like a guest was a forgivable mistake, but *admit that it was a mistake* and pledge to do better. Acknowledge that your \"intensity\" was a problem, and pledge to do better. That opens the way forward for your son to be a peacemaker between you and his GF, and shows that you're willing to change.\n\nThe second way, your way, was to deny that these things were a problem and blame the GF for feeling uncomfortable and demanding to be \"catered to\".\n\nShe's not demanding anything. She's distancing herself from you, because you are singling her out and treating her differently. \n\n>  She can get her own coffee!\n\nOf course she can. So can anyone.

He's saying that you didn't treat her graciously, a host to a guest, like *you did for the other guests*.\n\nWho likes to be singled out for different treatment? She's bound to ask herself why she's being asked to clean, and others are not, or why she was offered nothing, while others were served.\n\nYou made her feel awkward and unwelcome.

If she wants to sit with you or your son then she will 3-if you are offering everyone else something then it is rude to ignore her and expect her to serve herself if that's not the expectation for everyone. It's like you expect her to help clean and serve herself because she's a woman but not ask the men to clean and are willing to offer to wait on the men. That's being a really bad host and sexist.

It's clear that you *never* take feedback well.", "YTA. As a mom to adult children I have to say that you seem to be over bearing when it comes to this woman. She sits next to your son because that's who she's comfortable with. You butted into a conversation she was having with your husband, made her clean up like she's a maid, didn't offer her coffee when you offered it to others, and then make your son feel bad for bringing these things up.

This is about you not understanding appropriate boundaries. In most conflicts with 50-65 year old women, it *always* seems to come back to boundaries...

It's just common courtesy to do so.\n\nAnd lastly, in regards to how you treated his other girlfriend- just because you apologize for something, doesn't mean it all goes away. And the fact you're still calling her 'an anxious mess' suggests you don't actually feel regret for how you acted, but are just annoyed that your son and his ex-gf were upset with your actions.\n\nFor this relationship though, I think this is the take away you need- this woman is in a relationship with your son, but that doesn't mean she has to go see you if you make her uncomfortable or hurt her feelings.\n\nShe's dating your son, not dating you.", "Do you have no manners.

It's important to make guests feel welcome and comfortable in your home, especially when it's someone your son is in a serious relationship with.

It might be worth reflecting on your actions and finding a balance between being involved and giving her some space.", "I don't think you did anything wrong.

It is a matter of you assuming. And apparently you have done this before, since your son brought up the thing with his ex.\n\nYou might want to take a serious at your actions.", "Are you the A? Let me count the ways.\n\n1. Interruptions. That\u2019s rude. Doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re doing it to or what your reason is. Short of, \u201cdinner\u2019s ready!\u201d or needing to announce some emergency, there\u2019s no reason to disrupt a conversation. That\u2019s especially true when you kick this off with saying you want to know her more- she\u2019s making inroads with your husband who should be a good stepping stone for bridging a relationship with you.\n\n2. I know that seating couples apart is a mingling thing, but that\u2019s more appropriate for large gatherings than a family dinner. You can get to know someone without being up in their personal space or causing them discomfort.\n\n3a. It\u2019s good guest etiquette to offer to help clean up. It\u2019s atrocious hostess etiquette to single out *one* person to help you with that. In your comments your elaborate that your husband and son were occupied with something else. You have no issues interrupting the conversations your husband has with the girlfriend; surely you can interrupt the menfolk for cleanup assistance.\n\n3b. While not everyone likes coffee, there\u2019s no reason to exclude her from the offer. And in reference to your, \u201cshe\u2019s capable and can get it herself,\u201d excuse, are your husband and son incapable of serving themselves? Then you go on to insist that she has a preference for tea. Keeping a box of tea on hand is a kind and inexpensive gesture, something many people would do if they had an interest in learning about someone.\n\n4. You\u2019ve established a pattern of disregarding the needs of those around you for whatever your preference is. You disregarded your son\u2019s request to keep things low key for his ex because of her anxiety. You\u2019ve proven yourself disrespectful and unable to honor boundaries.\n\n5. You used the word \u201ccatering\u201d in reference to this situation. Nothing your son told you is a request to cater to his girlfriend! She\u2019d like to be treated courteously.

You know, out of basic good manners?", "I have been in situations where I\u2019m talking with someone\u2019s older husband and the wife keeps interjecting because she thinks I\u2019m bored. It is so disrespectful that I always make sure to show more interest to what he\u2019s saying bc I\u2019m embarrassed for him that his wife thinks he\u2019s boring to me - I hate that kind of overbearing person. It\u2019s awful when men do it to their wives too. And the person interjecting only makes themselves look bad. It\u2019s not necessarily a boring conversation. And even if it is, I often want to show respect by listening. I\u2019m sure your DIL was trying to be polite.\n\nI had an overbearing MIL and it was awful visiting them. I hated when I had to go. So if you want her to come over more, keep back. Don\u2019t force yourself to sit next to her! And have the men do chores instead of the guest! \n\nI always offer to help clean when I\u2019m a guest somewhere so that is good manners I think for anyone but if you are raising a son to be catered to, you are doing a bad job as a woman. Mothers of sons need to raise their sons to treat women right, and not expect them to be servants to men. It\u2019s a two way street. Thankfully your son seems to know better and isn\u2019t forcing his mother onto his gf. \n\nIf you want to have future grandkids visit, it\u2019s time to back off and stop interjecting yourself. She doesn\u2019t like you and neither does this sub! \ud83d\ude06 And clearly this isn\u2019t specific only to this one gf so it will happen with anyone he dates and brings home. YTA", "Yes, thank you.  This just reeks of toxic misogynist boomer. It especially stood out that the girlfriend was expected to help wash dishes because she is female. Regardless of the fact she is a guest in the house. \"Get up and get your own coffee if you want it\" also saying, \"you're the new house slave, you serve us we don't serve you. Keep washing our dishes, we want them extra shiny.  And I'll interrupt your conversations any time I feel like it. As the youngest woman at the bottom of the totem pole, get used to it babe.\" \n\nIt's obvious why this couple avoids the mom and why the mom will not be a factor or presence in this couple's life in the future.", "Oh god, that reminds me of a visit... Went somewhere for the first time. While they explicitly told me that I should help myself to things in the kitchen ... I didn't know where stuff was. The only things they had out were stuff with caffeine (energy drinks, coke, ice tea, ...) and it was evening. And I'm really sensitive to caffeine. I left like 16h after I had arrived, without having had a drop of anything to drink, because I was even expected to be able to handle the complicated coffee machine (would've had to weigh and grind the beans myself) in the morning... I almost exploded on someone on my way home because I had such a raging headache.\n\nI never went back, because I felt so, so unwelcome. I know I could've asked, but I wasn't the only guest and the hosts were constantly busy with everyone else.", "Unless it was edited, she said \u201cget\u201d not \u201cmake\u201d, which is different", "Yeah, that was so weird, expecting the gf to cozy up to her, physically.", "Maybe they have one of those comically long dining tables and the gf would've been soooooo far away mummy wouldn't have been able to question her about her intentions with her baby boy.", "I take issue with that being a southern thing. Everyone in the south I know and was raised around treats ALL guests with utmost importance.  Everyone is offered coffee or whatever and no one is expecred to help clean or get their own regardless of gender. Even visiting family is treated like royalty. The southern way is to make all guests feel special and cater to them. My grandfathers on both sides were the ones to clean the kitchen after meals.", "Oh my mother effin god if this isn\u2019t the damn truth. \nSorry. \nBut the the amount of times I have pointed out to my mother, aunt, and grandmother how sexist it was/is that they always made/make (just me now that my sister has gone low contact with them) just me and my sister serve every one dessert after dinner while my brother and cousin got to sit with all the men at the dining room table or in the living room. \nIt is so ingrained in southern culture that the females do the serving and the bidding and all of the \u2018house work\u2019 but not the \u2018man work\u2019 like we weren\u2019t allowed to cut the ham or grill. That was my grandpas job. \nAnd now my brother brings my sister in law around and she gets pulled in like OP tried to do to her sons gf and recently my cousins been bringing his gf (he\u2019s about to propose\ud83d\ude0a) and she gets sucked in and I\u2019m like wait but aren\u2019t they guests? Like also they can scope their own ice cream? \n\nMy family has gotten tired of listening to me complain about the patriarchy (and being lactose intolerant) though so I\u2019m not asked to help with dessert anymore.

This is the way. OP, you will be uncomfortable for some time while you figure out how to change but, in the long run, you will be a MUCH happier person if you do.\n\nPlease, take this advice. It\u2019s your best chance of having any kind of real relationship with your son going forward. \n\nMost children grow up, get married, and have children of their own. Do you want a good relationship with your son and your future DiL (whether it\u2019s his current GF or someone else)? Do you want to be part of your grandchildren\u2019s lives? Of course you do. You need to swallow your pride now, and eat an entire humble pie. It\u2019s going to be tough and it\u2019s going to make you crazy sometimes. But you can do it. And if you stick with it long enough you\u2019ll have better relationships with family, you\u2019ll have more and better friends, and you will live a happier and more fulfilled life.\n\nYou can do better.

When we get together, my family has to kick people *out of* the kitchen so we have room to even let the cleanup crew do their job. The person who pours the last full cup of coffee is expected to brew another pot unless everyone is done, and if one person has the pot when someone else needs a cup, they pour for the other person as well. No genders in there because *basic human decency isn't exclusive to women.* \n\nFellas with OP's mindset, I promise you won't melt from offering us womenfolk a cup of coffee or cleaning the kitchen after dinner.

Maybe she was an \u201canxious mess\u201d because you completely ambushed her LITERALLY the first time you met her? Holy shit that poor girl!

And a shit MIL.", "Yeahh I\u2019m from Arkansas. Dishes are where the Womenfolk belong! \nNo but really. Don\u2019t get me started on Christmas baking. \nEvery year I make my mother and grandmother endure a 45 minute rant during baking about the fact that it is unfair that I have been forced to come since Ive been a toddler (not that I don\u2019t want to I get sweets) but my brother doesn\u2019t. \nAnd then they used to say, well he does. (He got brought until he was like 11 bc he couldn\u2019t be left at home alone)\nAnd I\u2019d say nooo he goes and watches sports in the media room with our grandpa while y\u2019all make me labor in here and he still gets to try the sweets. \n\nAnd thus I became a feminist. Idk what they expected from me. \n\nIn all honesty it\u2019s so many small things. It\u2019s the after meal dishes, it\u2019s who sets the table, it\u2019s who was asked to do indoor vs outdoor chores (as in \u201cwoman chores\u201d and \u201cman chores\u201d), it\u2019s who fills the drink glasses, and yeah Christmas baking, where people sit at family meals, the language that\u2019s used. I mean once you notice it, it\u2019s hard to stop noticing it. \n\nAnd what\u2019s even worse is just like in your case it causes the significant others of my cousin and brother and probably one day my significant other to be expected to help with setting up for meals and cleaning up after meals and those are things you would never expect of a guest, but a significant other is \u00bffamily? so they are no longer a guest I guess? \n\nDoesn\u2019t make sense to me, but like I iterated about Christmas baking I think the patriarchy is seeped deeply into all of it and that\u2019s why it\u2019s like that.
