She doesn't know anyone, so it's completely normal that she'd stick close to the one person she does know.  \n3. And why would you offer coffee to everyone EXCEPT her??  First you said you didn't think she wanted any, but then you say she can get her own.  \n\nThis is not catering to someone with unreasonable demands, this is having common courtesy and trying to make a new person feel comfortable in your home.

Sure, failing to treat your son's GF like a guest was a forgivable mistake, but *admit that it was a mistake* and pledge to do better. Acknowledge that your \"intensity\" was a problem, and pledge to do better. That opens the way forward for your son to be a peacemaker between you and his GF, and shows that you're willing to change.\n\nThe second way, your way, was to deny that these things were a problem and blame the GF for feeling uncomfortable and demanding to be \"catered to\".\n\nShe's not demanding anything. She's distancing herself from you, because you are singling her out and treating her differently. \n\n>  She can get her own coffee!\n\nOf course she can. So can anyone. But the objection your son raised was this: \n\n>  asking her to help with clean up and not offering her coffee when I offered everyone else. I will admit that is true\n\nHe's not saying you had to offer her coffee. He's saying that you didn't treat her graciously, a host to a guest, like *you did for the other guests*.\n\nWho likes to be singled out for different treatment? She's bound to ask herself why she's being asked to clean, and others are not, or why she was offered nothing, while others were served.\n\nYou made her feel awkward and unwelcome. I'm not saying you *intended* to do that, but you did. Own it, don't deny it.", "She doesn\u2019t want to come over cause you\u2019re rude, you\u2019re condescending, you\u2019re imposing, you lack self awareness, you don\u2019t listen to others and present yourself as a person to avoid.

If she wants to sit with you or your son then she will 3-if you are offering everyone else something then it is rude to ignore her and expect her to serve herself if that's not the expectation for everyone. It's like you expect her to help clean and serve herself because she's a woman but not ask the men to clean and are willing to offer to wait on the men. That's being a really bad host and sexist. I wouldn't want to come over either if that is how I was treated.", "YTA\n\nWhat you call catering anyone else would call not making weird baseless assumptions.\n\nYou assume she would want to sit next to you.\n\nYou assume she doesn't want coffee.\n\nYou assume she's bored.\n\nEverything you do in regards to her is about your wants and desires.", ">1) I kept on interrupting conversations she was having with my husband\n\nFull stop. Interrupting people is rude. Period. None of your reasons matter.\n\n>2) I try to get too close to her during dinner\n\nThat's just creepy. Of course she wants to sit *next to her boyfriend* and you don't get to decide otherwise. Unless your dinner table is 15 ft. long, she can get to know you just fine anywhere she sits.\n\n>3) I wasn\u2019t very hospitable by asking her to help with clean up and not offering her coffee when I offered everyone else.\n\nWTF is wrong with you?

If your goal is to see the two of them more, you can't call them \"ridiculous\" and then expect them to come around more.\n\nYour reaction, your tone, the fact that your son was hesitant to bring these concerns to you in the first place, and the fact that your son refused to debate/elaborate after you objected to his concerns all point to a pattern you have of being extremely defensive and dismissive about your problematic behaviors. It's clear that you *never* take feedback well.", "YTA. As a mom to adult children I have to say that you seem to be over bearing when it comes to this woman. She sits next to your son because that's who she's comfortable with. You butted into a conversation she was having with your husband, made her clean up like she's a maid, didn't offer her coffee when you offered it to others, and then make your son feel bad for bringing these things up. You need to own your mistakes, apologize to this young lady, and do better next time.", "YTA. Not because you weren't \"catering\" to her.

She\u2019s not looking to be \u2018catered to\u2019. Ne t time (if there is a next time), try asking for her input. Even approach as a reboot on the relationship and show you want to welcome her into the family.", "YTA, not being interrupted, and being asked to do the dishes (did your son also help) and not being offered coffee when everyone else is, is not being catered to.", "Yes YTA big time. Look at all these assumptions that you made. I wouldn\u2019t want to be around you either.", "YTA you keep ASSuming things and being a very rude hostess\n\n1) she was having a conversation and you\u2019 ASSumed she was bored , because why would she enjoy having ga conversation with a man. so you were an AH and interrupted \n2) you insisted on her sitting next to you instead of her BF like she was a child not an adult who should sit with her partner\n3) she was a GUEST and you insisted she come and clean up, instead of offering her coffee.  You should have let things stay and had coffee/tea or whatever and all sat and relaxed to get to know each other\n\nYou are a horrible hostess and presumptuous AH", "YTA. This is about you not understanding appropriate boundaries. In most conflicts with 50-65 year old women, it *always* seems to come back to boundaries... OP, you ask inappropriate questions, sit too closely, you put pressure on them to spend time with you, you called her immature in your post, and you have a history of this behavior. It's rude to not offer coffee!!!\n\nHugely anecdotal, but I don't know what it is about this age group of women, but it's like they become oblivious to their own weirdness as they age.

It's just common courtesy to do so.\n\nAnd lastly, in regards to how you treated his other girlfriend- just because you apologize for something, doesn't mean it all goes away. And the fact you're still calling her 'an anxious mess' suggests you don't actually feel regret for how you acted, but are just annoyed that your son and his ex-gf were upset with your actions.\n\nFor this relationship though, I think this is the take away you need- this woman is in a relationship with your son, but that doesn't mean she has to go see you if you make her uncomfortable or hurt her feelings.\n\nShe's dating your son, not dating you.", "Do you have no manners.

What you're doing doesn't sound generally assholish but she clearly doesn't like it. \n\nRegarding the coffee, even if you think she doesn't want coffee, it's rude not to ask a guest. Offer any hot drink, doesn't have to be coffee.", "NTA, but there may be room for improvement. It's important to make guests feel welcome and comfortable in your home, especially when it's someone your son is in a serious relationship with. While she may not need to be catered to excessively, a little consideration and understanding can go a long way in creating a more positive environment for everyone involved. It might be worth reflecting on your actions and finding a balance between being involved and giving her some space.", "I don't think you did anything wrong.

It is a matter of you assuming. And apparently you have done this before, since your son brought up the thing with his ex.\n\nYou might want to take a serious at your actions.", "Are you the A? Let me count the ways.\n\n1. Interruptions. That\u2019s rude. Doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019re doing it to or what your reason is. Short of, \u201cdinner\u2019s ready!\u201d or needing to announce some emergency, there\u2019s no reason to disrupt a conversation. That\u2019s especially true when you kick this off with saying you want to know her more- she\u2019s making inroads with your husband who should be a good stepping stone for bridging a relationship with you.\n\n2. I know that seating couples apart is a mingling thing, but that\u2019s more appropriate for large gatherings than a family dinner. You can get to know someone without being up in their personal space or causing them discomfort.\n\n3a. It\u2019s good guest etiquette to offer to help clean up. It\u2019s atrocious hostess etiquette to single out *one* person to help you with that. In your comments your elaborate that your husband and son were occupied with something else. You have no issues interrupting the conversations your husband has with the girlfriend; surely you can interrupt the menfolk for cleanup assistance.\n\n3b. While not everyone likes coffee, there\u2019s no reason to exclude her from the offer. And in reference to your, \u201cshe\u2019s capable and can get it herself,\u201d excuse, are your husband and son incapable of serving themselves? Then you go on to insist that she has a preference for tea. Keeping a box of tea on hand is a kind and inexpensive gesture, something many people would do if they had an interest in learning about someone.\n\n4. You\u2019ve established a pattern of disregarding the needs of those around you for whatever your preference is. You disregarded your son\u2019s request to keep things low key for his ex because of her anxiety. You\u2019ve proven yourself disrespectful and unable to honor boundaries.\n\n5. You used the word \u201ccatering\u201d in reference to this situation. Nothing your son told you is a request to cater to his girlfriend! She\u2019d like to be treated courteously.

You push cleaning onto her when she is meant to be there for a meal or two as a guest.
