I am struggling to see why we are the assholes as deemed by my parents and sister. My husband uses Reddit and thought this sub would provide a third insight that we are missing.\n\nMy husband (42M) and I (40F) have 2 daughters: Jane (22F) and Lisa (5F). This concerns Jane who has been struggling with the cold.\n\nJane started to complain about the temperature of the house now it\u2019s no longer summertime. Currently, we leave the central heating off all the time apart from in the early morning (5-7am) so Lisa doesn\u2019t get too cold when she is awake. My husband and I don\u2019t have an issue with the temperature of the house (its approx 16C at night across all of the bedrooms since we checked in case her room was draftier), we don\u2019t really feel it and do not see where Jane is coming from. Jane complains and says she wears multiple layers to bed and around the house while we are all asleep. \n\nSo, she asked if she could have access to the thermostat in order to switch the heating on at a higher temperature than 18C (what we set it as). She wants to raise it to 21C but we said no. She keeps complaining about how she has to wear 4 layers to bed so she doesn\u2019t feel cold in the morning. Lisa says it isn\u2019t cold when we ask her, my husband and I also don\u2018t feel the cold so we said no to her asking and thought that would put an end to it.\n\nIt did not. We had dinner at my parents house in which Jane was making comments about how warm and toasty her grandparents\u2019 house is. My parents were shocked that we didn\u2019t allow her access to the thermostat and they tried to sway us into giving her access because it isn\u2019t right for her to sleep in multiple layers. My sister also agreed with them and said my daughter has valid points since the temperature is starting to drop in the night.\n\nAre we wrong here?

That's just a fact.\n\nI have a daughter roughly Jane's age. She doesn't have an ounce of spare fat, and is cold in the summer (air conditioning) and cold in the winter (not hot enough for her). When she went to college, she purposely limited her choices to warm parts of the country.\n\nMy wife, on the other hand, is hot all the time. \n\nWhat Jane needs is a heated mattress cover. Nice thick duvet, heated mattress pad, and she'll be warm and toasty in bed even though you keep your house at 18 C in the daytime (and presumably it gets colder at night).\n\nSo YTA, because you're dismissing Jane's comfort as irrelevant. Turning the thermostat up isn't the right solution, because that's expensive, and will probably make the house too hot for you and your husband.", "Jane may be cold natured as my grandmother called it. Just because everyone else feels ok, doesn't mean she doesn't feel cold. That being said, I think two things. Will raising the thermostat three points make it uncomfortable for everyone else. If not, why not raise it. Secondly, why not get her a small heater for her room. At least she can sleep warmly. I hate being warm, especially when sleeping.

I see you're not interested in keeping the heat on consistently either, so that's miserable for her as well. Why do you think she should suffer so you can save a few dollars on the power bill? Also, the things most folks are suggesting (heating blankets, space heaters, etc) actually use more electric than just keeping your house a comfortable and consistent temperature.

This is very different than \u201cthree out of four people are too hot at 21C\u201d\n\nGiven that money doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue, keeping the temperature colder just because only one person finds it cold seems just plain petty and spiteful.", "INFO: Would a compromise like running the heat longer work for both of you?  21c is might warm to keep a house, but 16c is unpleasantly cold.

You might still need to buy her a warmer duvet at that temp, though.", "YTA here and this is my reasoning.\n\nI have read multiple comments where Jane has tried to make compromises with you and gets shot down each time. You won\u2019t let her have a space heater or a electric blanket. Since it will spike the energy bill. So she asked if she could turn up the degrees to 21 degrees Celsius which isn\u2019t that high above normal. I understand wanting to cut costs but what Jane has been doing isn\u2019t working. \nShe is already making accommodations for your need by wearing 4 layers. \n\n4 layers of clothing isn\u2019t going to help her face. I know this is a wild thought but put the heat on before bed. Once everyone is asleep and comfy then turn it off. \n\n64/18 Celsius degrees may be fine for you but in the winter that would drive me insane.

I am in the US and don\u2019t know how different your HVAC system is.  We have programmable Ecobee thermostats.  It has remote sensors you can put in other rooms to monitor and balance the temp if needed.  We have a sensor in our bedroom and in our daughter\u2019s.

I know this because I've been telling all my friends to get one today, because I have one and it is absolutely magical for keeping warm and also for managing back and shoulder pain (which is what I primarily use it for, but that thing is glued to me all winter).\n\nWith that your daughter can be incredibly toasty, and the rest of you can enjoy the cooler ambient temperature.\n\nPlease at least check that heat mat out and see what I mean. Yes she will have to unplug to wander around the house but if she's sat anywhere with a plug socket nearby she can be plugged in and super warm.

Its currently below 10 degrees outside and you're not using the central heating - of course she feels cold.

You are being a dick about this but at the least you could buy her a cheap electric heater, you can get them from screwfix for like \u00a325.", "YTA\n\nGive her solutions, don't make her just put up with it. The simplest would be to raise the thermostat a little, as the rest of your wouldn't overheat and she might be comfortable then.\n\nDifferent people have different comfortable temperatures. I personally would be comfortable with your normal temperature, as would two of my children. My wife and third child would not, and it's hard to sleep well when you're too cold.", "So based off the comments you won\u2019t let your daughter get a space heater, an electric blanket OR contribute to the power bill simply because you don\u2019t want it warmer. Why? No money issues at all but you need to start saving to spend extra money on the younger daughter. You suck and I would hate to be your daughter. How many other things in life have you neglected her on?", "Do you even like your daughter, she is freezing and you go to Reddit instead. I hate freezing. 16 is too cold for me. \n\nSeveral years ago we lived in an apartment that was particularly cold in the winter, and we couldn\u2019t really afford to warm it up properly. After three months of that misery we actually decided to do whatever we could to get out of there. That included changing jobs to afford a better place. I just didn\u2019t want to waste my life on being miserable 24/7.

Why does only Lisa get consideration for temperature control? Are y\u2019all that poor that you have to keep the heat off in winter? Do you know it expends more energy to turn the heat on only 2 hours a day versus keeping it on all day? \n\nAlso, how is it 16c in the bedrooms even though your thermostat is set to 18c (which is still cold, in my opinion)?", "16 is cold. I personally prefer 20. It can be hard to concentrate and study if you are feeling cold, but maybe if you are all more comfortable when it is colder, you can get her an Oodie and a small storage heater for her room.\n\nEdit: typo", "Another suggestion: could your daughter get a medical check up? I was cold for years, although I kept my home around 22\u00b0. Turns out, I had something really common and easy to treat, and nowadays I am happy with my bedroom at 16\u00b0 to sleep.", "18c is the minimum heat required in rentals here. Just saying, 16c is a bit on the lower side. I had 15c during the winter time once and it's not fun at all to sleep in that.", "You refuse every possible answer that would raise the heat in your daughter's room. Can't turn the heat higher in the morning (the only time she seems to complain about it); can't get an electric blanket/heating pad/mattress warmer/space heater; can't do anything except wear a fifth layer and add another blanket and never ever talk to anyone about being cold because the rest of you aren't. (Incidentally, I do believe the rest of you are fine, I'd be perfectly happy with that temperature as well, though I turn it up when I am sick. I am well aware that I am in the extreme minority about this temperature preference.)\n\nWhy did you ask if the only answers you will accept are: make her wear more/better layers; give her more/better blankets; get her to see a doctor to see if her entirely normal temperature preferences are due to secret illness. \n\nIf you really cannot afford it, can you see how much more electricity you use if the heat were set higher in the mornings and have Jane chip in there? YTA because you are cutting off any solutions that aren't \"we do nothing and our daughter shuts up because we think it's fine\".", "Absolutely the AH. \n\nThis is your child telling you they are taking reasonable steps to keep warm and still feel cold! If they were walking round in skimpy clothes I would have some sympathy for you but you seem to be showing her no consideration at all. Either turn the heating up and wear less yourselves or get her a separate source of heating for her space", "INFO: is your refusal to increase the temperature merely out of defiance, or are you struggling to afford the bills? \n\nI'm coming at this from a more sympathetic perspective than a lot of folks commenting here, as I'm from the UK and know how hard the cost of living is hitting everyone.\n\nHowever, I can potentially relate to Jane's point of view too. I (24M, also living at home but working full time and contributing) have had several arguments with my mother over how unnecessarily obsessive she's become over heating and electricity costs. I'm all for not being wasteful, but I don't want to live in a freezing house if I don't need to. And we don't need to, because we have 2 incomes and are not struggling to pay the bills. If this is your situation, then I'd say YTA. If Jane is contributing to the bills, and you can afford to turn the heating up, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't. \n\nHowever, if you are struggling, then I do sympathise. 16\u00b0C is cold though, and I'd be concerned about bigger issues developing in your home (e.g dampness and mould) as a result.

Some rooms genuinely are colder, and if it's a little damp it'll feel even colder than it really is. You could turn the radiators down in the warm rooms (or if, for some of them), and turn hers to high, or agree to her having a space heater. They do cost more than the radiator, but it sounds like she does actually need it.\n\nI get annoyed with my daughter for not putting on warm clothing in her bedroom, but I mean a warm dressing gown or a cardigan, exactly what I do myself. However, her room genuinely is colder than the rest of the flat due to being an old extension with poor insulation and three external walls, so even if she wore appropriate clothing she'd need the heater some of the time.\n\nIt's not uncommon for one room to be colder than the others. TBH I'd say it's actually slightly unlikely that all the rooms are the exact same temperature all the time, especially if it's an older building.", "YTAif you can\u2019t meet somewhere in the middle.
