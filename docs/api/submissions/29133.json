I am struggling to see why we are the assholes as deemed by my parents and sister. My husband uses Reddit and thought this sub would provide a third insight that we are missing.\n\nMy husband (42M) and I (40F) have 2 daughters: Jane (22F) and Lisa (5F). This concerns Jane who has been struggling with the cold.\n\nJane started to complain about the temperature of the house now it\u2019s no longer summertime. Currently, we leave the central heating off all the time apart from in the early morning (5-7am) so Lisa doesn\u2019t get too cold when she is awake. My husband and I don\u2019t have an issue with the temperature of the house (its approx 16C at night across all of the bedrooms since we checked in case her room was draftier), we don\u2019t really feel it and do not see where Jane is coming from. Jane complains and says she wears multiple layers to bed and around the house while we are all asleep. \n\nSo, she asked if she could have access to the thermostat in order to switch the heating on at a higher temperature than 18C (what we set it as). She wants to raise it to 21C but we said no. She keeps complaining about how she has to wear 4 layers to bed so she doesn\u2019t feel cold in the morning. Lisa says it isn\u2019t cold when we ask her, my husband and I also don\u2018t feel the cold so we said no to her asking and thought that would put an end to it.\n\nIt did not. We had dinner at my parents house in which Jane was making comments about how warm and toasty her grandparents\u2019 house is. My parents were shocked that we didn\u2019t allow her access to the thermostat and they tried to sway us into giving her access because it isn\u2019t right for her to sleep in multiple layers. My sister also agreed with them and said my daughter has valid points since the temperature is starting to drop in the night.\n\nAre we wrong here?

That's just a fact.\n\nI have a daughter roughly Jane's age. She doesn't have an ounce of spare fat, and is cold in the summer (air conditioning) and cold in the winter (not hot enough for her). When she went to college, she purposely limited her choices to warm parts of the country.\n\nMy wife, on the other hand, is hot all the time. \n\nWhat Jane needs is a heated mattress cover. Nice thick duvet, heated mattress pad, and she'll be warm and toasty in bed even though you keep your house at 18 C in the daytime (and presumably it gets colder at night).\n\nSo YTA, because you're dismissing Jane's comfort as irrelevant. Turning the thermostat up isn't the right solution, because that's expensive, and will probably make the house too hot for you and your husband.", "Jane may be cold natured as my grandmother called it. Just because everyone else feels ok, doesn't mean she doesn't feel cold. That being said, I think two things. Will raising the thermostat three points make it uncomfortable for everyone else.

I see you're not interested in keeping the heat on consistently either, so that's miserable for her as well. Why do you think she should suffer so you can save a few dollars on the power bill? Also, the things most folks are suggesting (heating blankets, space heaters, etc) actually use more electric than just keeping your house a comfortable and consistent temperature.

This is very different than \u201cthree out of four people are too hot at 21C\u201d\n\nGiven that money doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue, keeping the temperature colder just because only one person finds it cold seems just plain petty and spiteful.", "INFO: Would a compromise like running the heat longer work for both of you?  21c is might warm to keep a house, but 16c is unpleasantly cold.

You won\u2019t let her have a space heater or a electric blanket. Since it will spike the energy bill. So she asked if she could turn up the degrees to 21 degrees Celsius which isn\u2019t that high above normal. I understand wanting to cut costs but what Jane has been doing isn\u2019t working. \nShe is already making accommodations for your need by wearing 4 layers. \n\n4 layers of clothing isn\u2019t going to help her face. I know this is a wild thought but put the heat on before bed. Once everyone is asleep and comfy then turn it off. \n\n64/18 Celsius degrees may be fine for you but in the winter that would drive me insane.

It has remote sensors you can put in other rooms to monitor and balance the temp if needed.  We have a sensor in our bedroom and in our daughter\u2019s.

Yes she will have to unplug to wander around the house but if she's sat anywhere with a plug socket nearby she can be plugged in and super warm.

You are being a dick about this but at the least you could buy her a cheap electric heater, you can get them from screwfix for like \u00a325.", "YTA\n\nGive her solutions, don't make her just put up with it. The simplest would be to raise the thermostat a little, as the rest of your wouldn't overheat and she might be comfortable then.\n\nDifferent people have different comfortable temperatures. I personally would be comfortable with your normal temperature, as would two of my children. My wife and third child would not, and it's hard to sleep well when you're too cold.", "So based off the comments you won\u2019t let your daughter get a space heater, an electric blanket OR contribute to the power bill simply because you don\u2019t want it warmer. Why? No money issues at all but you need to start saving to spend extra money on the younger daughter. You suck and I would hate to be your daughter. How many other things in life have you neglected her on?", "Do you even like your daughter, she is freezing and you go to Reddit instead. I hate freezing. 16 is too cold for me. \n\nSeveral years ago we lived in an apartment that was particularly cold in the winter, and we couldn\u2019t really afford to warm it up properly. After three months of that misery we actually decided to do whatever we could to get out of there. That included changing jobs to afford a better place.

Why does only Lisa get consideration for temperature control? Are y\u2019all that poor that you have to keep the heat off in winter? Do you know it expends more energy to turn the heat on only 2 hours a day versus keeping it on all day? \n\nAlso, how is it 16c in the bedrooms even though your thermostat is set to 18c (which is still cold, in my opinion)?", "16 is cold. I personally prefer 20. It can be hard to concentrate and study if you are feeling cold, but maybe if you are all more comfortable when it is colder, you can get her an Oodie and a small storage heater for her room.\n\nEdit: typo", "Another suggestion: could your daughter get a medical check up? I was cold for years, although I kept my home around 22\u00b0.

Just saying, 16c is a bit on the lower side. I had 15c during the winter time once and it's not fun at all to sleep in that.", "You refuse every possible answer that would raise the heat in your daughter's room. Can't turn the heat higher in the morning (the only time she seems to complain about it); can't get an electric blanket/heating pad/mattress warmer/space heater; can't do anything except wear a fifth layer and add another blanket and never ever talk to anyone about being cold because the rest of you aren't.

I am well aware that I am in the extreme minority about this temperature preference.)\n\nWhy did you ask if the only answers you will accept are: make her wear more/better layers; give her more/better blankets; get her to see a doctor to see if her entirely normal temperature preferences are due to secret illness. \n\nIf you really cannot afford it, can you see how much more electricity you use if the heat were set higher in the mornings and have Jane chip in there? YTA because you are cutting off any solutions that aren't \"we do nothing and our daughter shuts up because we think it's fine\".", "Absolutely the AH. \n\nThis is your child telling you they are taking reasonable steps to keep warm and still feel cold! If they were walking round in skimpy clothes I would have some sympathy for you but you seem to be showing her no consideration at all. Either turn the heating up and wear less yourselves or get her a separate source of heating for her space", "INFO: is your refusal to increase the temperature merely out of defiance, or are you struggling to afford the bills? \n\nI'm coming at this from a more sympathetic perspective than a lot of folks commenting here, as I'm from the UK and know how hard the cost of living is hitting everyone.\n\nHowever, I can potentially relate to Jane's point of view too. I (24M, also living at home but working full time and contributing) have had several arguments with my mother over how unnecessarily obsessive she's become over heating and electricity costs. I'm all for not being wasteful, but I don't want to live in a freezing house if I don't need to. And we don't need to, because we have 2 incomes and are not struggling to pay the bills. If this is your situation, then I'd say YTA. If Jane is contributing to the bills, and you can afford to turn the heating up, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't. \n\nHowever, if you are struggling, then I do sympathise. 16\u00b0C is cold though, and I'd be concerned about bigger issues developing in your home (e.g dampness and mould) as a result.

Some rooms genuinely are colder, and if it's a little damp it'll feel even colder than it really is. You could turn the radiators down in the warm rooms (or if, for some of them), and turn hers to high, or agree to her having a space heater. They do cost more than the radiator, but it sounds like she does actually need it.\n\nI get annoyed with my daughter for not putting on warm clothing in her bedroom, but I mean a warm dressing gown or a cardigan, exactly what I do myself. However, her room genuinely is colder than the rest of the flat due to being an old extension with poor insulation and three external walls, so even if she wore appropriate clothing she'd need the heater some of the time.\n\nIt's not uncommon for one room to be colder than the others. TBH I'd say it's actually slightly unlikely that all the rooms are the exact same temperature all the time, especially if it's an older building.", "YTAif you can\u2019t meet somewhere in the middle.

When I am in the house by myself (which is often) I turn the thermostat down to 17 and our night setting is 15.5.\n\nThe only person I know who keeps the temperature around 20 is my 93 year old nana and, as she\u2019s too frail to use the stairs in her house now, all the radiators are off upstairs!", "This thread is wild man.", "Then the UK government needs to pay for it lol.

I have Raynaud\u2019s and an autoimmune disorder, and I spent substantial chunks of my adult life with low iron, sometimes to the point of anemia.  I suffer miserably when I\u2019m too cold.  Everything hurts, and if I can\u2019t get warm, there\u2019s a chance of tissue death, which can necessitate amputation of digits (Raynaud\u2019s is easy to manage if you can mostly keep warm, but it\u2019s no joke in the cold).\n\nMy husband and I lived in a hundred year old brick house with terrible insulation for several years in Philly.  We had to curtain off our living room from the stairs and the kitchen and use a space heater in the bathroom (a later addition that we think may not have been insulated at all) to keep it warm enough to not harm me.  I had fleece pajamas, a thick warm robe, and sheepskin slippers with the wool inside, and we\u2019d still end up with my husband using his own body heat to re-warm me after I\u2019d brushed my teeth and gotten ready for bed. (Bless him, he is a dear sweet man, he\u2019d be a bit comical about how cold my fingers and toes were sometimes, but he\u2019d just snuggle in closer and pull my cold body against him until my side of the bed and myself got warm enough for me to stop hurting.)", "I was looking for someone who said this.

I\u2019m now in Maryland and 78 is way too hot for me. I have it set to 72 in the summer and 68 in the winter. I\u2019m always shocked when I go back home that I acclimate to Phoenix weather very quickly. I\u2019ve been in Maryland for 12 years and when it gets into the 60s I\u2019m grumpy. I\u2019ve already turned the heat on this season. My husband (from Maryland) \u201cwhy is the heat on it\u2019s not cold yet\u201d.

They are REALLY EXPENSIVE to run and will dwarf other energy costs generally.\n\nI don't remember the figures now but it's a very expensive way to stay warm.\n\nIf people are right that it costs pennies per night to use a modern electric blanket that would seem like a good solution.", "You're factually wrong. Space heaters are energy suckers.", "The newer ones mostly have a timed shutoff. And, as the tag tells you, don't use it as a heated mattress pad or lay on top of it, they make ones that do that but using an electric blanket that way is dangerous.

I\u2019m a California girl.  We met in March, both living in PA.  On a memorable early date, he wore shorts, and we had to duck into shops every block or two walking back to our cars after dinner, because he was so cold!

Seems that unless Jane is extremely stupid, she'd have got herself an electric blanket if she could.", "She doesn't only want it for 2 hours, that's the issue.", "Also young children have more brown fat which helps keep them warm. Babies have the most and as we age it finishes greatly. So the 5yo probably is warm enough while the 22yo is frozen through.", "I'm 50 and have Raynaud's. My hands and feet are ALWAYS freezing. I've lived my whole life in Minnesota, where it gets VERY cold. I used to be fine having the thermostat at 66F when I am home and 61F while I'm asleep. Now I have the house at 69F while I'm awake and 65F while asleep. That's my bare minimum, now.", "I have always been very cold sensitive and share those ailments. I\u2019m the one in my fam most likely to pull out the head to toe cold weather coat when the season cool season is just getting underway and everyone else is still in jackets and it was something of a joke in my immediate family that I adored a pair of thick, warm socks or blanket or robe as a gift the way others would like a new electronic gadget. When I got to be an adult but was in the family house, I simply took over the electricity bill as part of my household contribution. Eventually though, it made more sense for me to get a space heater for my room and to layer up more fully in the cold weather, both for the general comfort of all the household, my budget and with a humble nod to environmental responsibility. It definitely helped cut down in everyone in the house bickering about the temperature. \n\nI\u2019m confused about the sleeping under multiple layers bit. I have cold weather material pjs and sheets and thick blankets. In hot weather I may only use the thin flat sheet but in winter I may use the thick flat sheet plus the blanket or comforter.

In the summer it's 87F+ outside and my room is filled with glass windows and doors which makes my room so hot especially with a running computer to heat up my room and having two fans on high. When the temp inside is set to 77-78,  I sometimes have to put an ice pack on my head because I feel I'm going to pass out. When I lived with roommates we always fought over a few degree differences (roommate would like 73 or below  and I would always raise it to 74+ and we went back and forth raising it and lowering it) I would always be so cold and annoyed and they would be hot since at the time they had a larger window in their room, everybody is different and every room feels different at different times (even if you stood in there for 5 minutes to feel the temperature she is referring to and checking the drift, that is not enough time to understand how the temperature affects her) I would suggest talking it though once more and finding a common ground to set the temperature to, so you can elevate any issues or negative feelings towards one another. I do get quite frustrated when I am not comfortable in my own environment so I understand her feelings.", "The worst thing is that I have Raynaud's and used to be the always cold one but discovered when I transitioned and started testosterone, it changes your comfortable temperature range but doesn't help the hands and feet.

They had zoned heating and it was set to heat the house as people moved around during the day...but that wasn't my schedule once I graduated.  So it would be in the 50s at night when I got home from work late at night.  A space heater to get it up to a tolerable temperature made my life much, much better.

I love sleeping in a cold room.", "Go fans!", "In my city we get a lot of rain but it rarely drops below zero. The big issue is that our houses are so shoddy and we don't have central heating so to keep the whole house at 20 I can imagine the power bill, possibly close to $1000 a month because you'd need to run the heat pump in the living room and then space heaters in the bedrooms. Bad insulation and single glazing in most houses means the heat just leaks out.", "Canadian here with cheap ass parents who froze all of my life. Own my home now as a grown woman and keep it comfy - 22/23 C. Ridiculous to say 16 C is comfortable for a home in winter.

They said they only keep the thermostat on for 2 hours all day, and then they only turn it up to 16. That's not a comfortable temperature to have the house at all day, unless you're doing a full deep clean all day every day, that is. Personally, I adjust the temperature based on what I'm doing. If I need to, I turn it down and open a window for a bit. But I'd rather be comfortable in my house than freeze. I'm sure OP's daughter feels the same.", "Imo, the perfect temperature is about 20C. But that's the average summer temp here, so it's what I'm used to. 18C is perfect for sleeping, but I want my house comfortable when I'm awake. I don't want to need to wear a hoodie, I want to be able to change without needing to rush. So starting to be too hot is better than being too cold imo. At least at this time of year.
