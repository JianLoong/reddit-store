I think that's understandable. It might be worth having a discussion with your mom that you have some feelings of resentment towards her and that you don't feel comfortable with her assuming it's okay to give her other daughter your things without asking first.

In my family it was custom that clothes in perfectly good condition (which most will be as kids grow out of them way faster than they wear down) will be handed down to younger siblings, cousins or family friends. It saves money and minimises waste. I got nearly all my sister's old clothes and then they went to someone else as well. \n\nWanting to reuse clothes doesnt mean she \"wont go to her new spouse for money\", they probably buy new ones as well.", "How do we know the mom paid for them?

Of course she went through a lot with her mother having an affair when she was really young, with a family friend at that.

I'm going to agree that it doesn't do you any good to carry on your anger. I noticed in your post that you described yourself as \"permanently traumatized\" and that's a terrible way to feel at your age, and it indicates to me that you haven't really dealt with it, and that will likely take some professional therapy. You're just 18, take it from someone 30 years older than you (who, for the record, had his father cheat on his mother and get another woman pregnant, giving me a younger half-sister, when I was 12, so I've been there), that's still very young. You *can* remove this trauma.   \n\n\nBut you need to do so for yourself. And no it does not mean that you *need* to \"forgive\" your mother or understand her actions, blah blah blah. She did what she did, and her entitlement in both the way she thought she could just take the clothes, but also how she scolded you and made you the bad guy, suggests that she doesn't accept responsibility for her actions and how they've affected others. It's a common misconception that letting go of anger requires forgiving the person who caused it. It doesn't, if you don't want to. It just means you don't have to let them affect you anymore.", ">let it go, love.\n\nYou're part of the problem. You can't just cheat and tear you family apart and expect the child to \"forgive and forget and let it go love <3\".

I'm sure if mom showed some humbleness and asked the father (and daughter) if she could have the clothing they would have considered otherwise (or not)  but her actions were a form of emotional rape.
