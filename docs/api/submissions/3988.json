I don't think the clothing is the actual issue here, but it could just be me reading into it wrong. I think that it was wrong for your mom to come by unannounced, and then taking some of your things (even though it's old clothes, it's still yours) to give to your half-sister probably set you off a bit. I think that's understandable. It might be worth having a discussion with your mom that you have some feelings of resentment towards her and that you don't feel comfortable with her assuming it's okay to give her other daughter your things without asking first. Communication here doesn't sound very good between all parties, maybe a sit-down discussion would help prevent future issues. Best of Luck.", "NTA- but this has nothing to do with your old clothes and everything to do with your mother. \n\nHas she ever apologized for her actions or taken responsibility for blowing up your world?

It might have been a bit petty, but your mother didn't ask you if she could have the clothes. \n\nI find it suspicious that she asked to grab \"some things\" from the basement. Your mother had to have known the clothes were down there and didn't want to rile you up. If your mother had anything of hers stored down there, she should have collected it long ago.\n\nI suggest you round up any old clothes that don't fit you and give them to charity.", "NTA your mother showing up unannounced and stealing YOUR clothes is insane. DO NOT give them to her", "NTA Your mother is an entitled asshole and I can't believe she had the audacity to just steal your clothes without even asking. Sure, you were really upset and said some things, but obviously that's been building up inside of you for quite some time. You weren't out of line though, she was. And you shouldn't just give in to someone like that because it just enables their nonsense.", "NTA\n\nBut, any chance your dad knew about this and forgot to tell you? He's reaction makes me think that. Also, you're 18 and we are talking about 8-9 year old clothing. It's not like you are going to wear them again (or hand them to your kid). The wrong part was that she came unannounced.", "NTA\n\nHow did she get into the house?   If you don't want to give her your old clothes, you don't have to.\n\nDon't let her in again. \n\nIt might be a good idea for you to see a counselor (if you haven't) to help you work through your residual anger and resentment.  Don't do it for anyone but yourself!\n\nHugs", "NTA. They are your clothes.  She should have asked permission first.  After 10 years, there should be nothing of hers left in the house.  I am surprised your dad was okay with her searching his house.", "NTA Though I think it\u2019s just plain rude of your mom to show up unannounced, I think it\u2019s also symbolic in a way that she is taking your stuff to give to her new daughter she had from her affair that destroyed your family life. So maybe subconsciously it triggered a - \u201cI\u2019m not giving away yet more of MY life to my mom\u2019s new family.\u201d resentment. Like she is making sure her second daughter has everything she needs, but she abandoned you feeling, even if that isn\u2019t entirely true.", "ESH. She should have asked. You shouldn't have told her your donation preference and that her husband could buy the clothing. That was, indeed, selfish and petty. It was clothing from when you were young, lying in your basement. It doesn't seem like you had any immediate plans to donate it.", "Both of you are. Her for not asking permission from your father for entry into the home and for just assuming she can take whatever is in there. You because you specifically don't want to donate old clothes that you likely wouldn't have touched had she not shown up. Though i do have to wonder why she won't go to her new spouse for money for clothes for the kid. Sounds like trouble in paradise.", "> because of her actions i am permanently traumatized\n\nYTA \n\nDrama much? Seriously grow up. \n\nAlso you didn't pay for the clothes that she's taking that you no longer use. What you're doing is being petty and childish.", "ESH - there\u2019s a protocol for removing things from your ex\u2019s house, and one of those protocols is communication and permission from the owner of the property.  It doesn\u2019t sound like that happened here.\n\nAs for you, not granting permission to give your decade-old clothes to your little sister - NOT because you loved them or want to use them on your own kid someday, but because you just don\u2019t want your mom and sister to use them makes you a petty a-hole.  If you really wanted to donate them, you would have donated them years ago instead of packing them away indefinitely.  These clothes were stored in the basement for a reason, and it clearly wasn\u2019t for you to use later.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She could have asked you if you would like your old clothes to go to your half sister. Instead she tried to take them without your consent. She went behind your back. While not as egregious as her affair, it was nonetheless behind your back.

That just seemed like an odd detail to me.  \n\n\nStill, agreed, NTA, the mother shouldn't just come in and take without asking.", "She doesn\u2019t have to give them up.", ">Though i do have to wonder why she won't go to her new spouse for money for clothes for the kid. Sounds like trouble in paradise.\n\nDid I miss something where OP said they have lots of money? In my family it was custom that clothes in perfectly good condition (which most will be as kids grow out of them way faster than they wear down) will be handed down to younger siblings, cousins or family friends. It saves money and minimises waste. I got nearly all my sister's old clothes and then they went to someone else as well. \n\nWanting to reuse clothes doesnt mean she \"wont go to her new spouse for money\", they probably buy new ones as well.", "How do we know the mom paid for them? It could've been the dad. If she doesn't want to give the clothes she doesn't have to they're HERS. Also her mom tore their home apart and she has a right to be angry and state so. It's not dramatic its just truthful. Aside from that why does mom think she can show up announced and start taking things? This obviously has nothing to do with the clothes and everything to do with mom.", "What is wrong with you?! Of course she went through a lot with her mother having an affair when she was really young, with a family friend at that. It was surely a nasty divorce, and clearly their relationship isn't very strong. And we don't know the whole story or how her mother has treated her all these years.\n\nBut those clothes belong to HER. Who paid for them is not relevant, but who says her mother paid for them? And if we don't know who paid for them, then why on earth is the mother entitled to them? The mother is the biggest asshole of them all for just STEALING belongings that belong to someone else. There's no excuse. If she had wanted those clothes she should have asked. \n\nThe fact you're calling OP the asshole and acting like the mother did nothing wrong seems really bizarre to me.

I'm going to agree that it doesn't do you any good to carry on your anger. I noticed in your post that you described yourself as \"permanently traumatized\" and that's a terrible way to feel at your age, and it indicates to me that you haven't really dealt with it, and that will likely take some professional therapy. You're just 18, take it from someone 30 years older than you (who, for the record, had his father cheat on his mother and get another woman pregnant, giving me a younger half-sister, when I was 12, so I've been there), that's still very young. You *can* remove this trauma.   \n\n\nBut you need to do so for yourself. And no it does not mean that you *need* to \"forgive\" your mother or understand her actions, blah blah blah. She did what she did, and her entitlement in both the way she thought she could just take the clothes, but also how she scolded you and made you the bad guy, suggests that she doesn't accept responsibility for her actions and how they've affected others. It's a common misconception that letting go of anger requires forgiving the person who caused it. It doesn't, if you don't want to. It just means you don't have to let them affect you anymore.", ">let it go, love.\n\nYou're part of the problem. You can't just cheat and tear you family apart and expect the child to \"forgive and forget and let it go love <3\". You may have come to peace with whatever YOU did (because you're an apologist for a reason) but never invalidate someone's feelings and tell them how to feel because YOU want to be forgiven, or YOU forgave someone else.", "I get this for sure, but an 18 year old is allowed to keep childhood relics as they see fit.

Walking into a home she no longer lives in is not acceptable and doing it when your dad isn\u2019t there implies your mother knew none of this was ok.", "NTA, she should never be allowed in the house again and you should have your Dad make it very clear that she is not welcome purely for your benefit.\n\nMake sure she doesn't have a key.", "Absolutely NTA.

She came into your house and started taking your things without even asking. That's stealing.

No.", "NTA and if you have anything you don't want this awful woman to have, put them under lock and key. Even now she's dishonest..", "N t a I hate parents like this thief", "NTA. I understand your dad doesn't want to add more to this chaos over old unused clothes, but your mother needs to understand that she needs to handle things like this with a lot more care, caution, sensitivity, and delicacy. Taking your old clothes (without even asking) has nothing to do with her kid- it doesn't benefit said kid, it benefits her parents who don't have to pay for new ones, the very 2 people you have a problem with and destroyed your family. Its cool that you've been cordial with them, but they're stepping over your toes now. Marching in and taking things to help her and her affair partner, she should have expected that not to go down well.

You don\u2019t think it\u2019d hurt for OP to see what she seems to perceive as the replacement daughter wearing her clothes? \n\nHer mom needs to make shit right before she goes rifling through her daughters old stuff to give to her new kid. And at the very, very pitiful least, she should have TALKED to OP about what she wanted to take before she went pilfering.\n\nYou\u2019re expecting a mature adult reaction from a deeply hurt teenager in a situation where she had to react in that moment because the courtesy of talking to her before coming in and taking things was disregarded. If you break up your family and hurt your kid that deeply, you don\u2019t get to demand they do favours for your new family.", ">1st to your sister. You should want to give your old clothes to her because..... she is your little sister. Why give them to strangers when you have a little sister. She did nothing to you and she didn't cause the divorce.

I said it before, but it probably feels  a lot like being replaced to OP.

At leas she'll use it.\n\nMy read on the situation is that there is resentment from the mother breaking up the family, and her coming in, assuming she could do whatever she wanted, while giving things to the embodiment of the destruction of her family was too much for OP. \n\nIt was mom doing whatever she wanted that blew up the family to begin with.  \n\nAnd I imagine seeing half sister wearing OP's old clothes would probably feel a lot like being replaced.", "She\u2019s 17 my dude, if they don\u2019t have good insurance, how exactly is she supposed to afford very expensive therapy? Maybe her mom should have organised that when she blew up the family.
