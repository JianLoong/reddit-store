We've been together for about 4 years and I love him very much, he's the kindest, handsomest, funniest man I've even known.\r  \n\r  \nThe thing is, he's got a 4yo cat that likes to pee on stuff. He uses his litterbox, but he's also peed on countless cloths, clothes and shoes. He pees on every rug availabe and has peed on the sofa. The house has that distinct ammonia smell underlying everything most of the time. He's peed on an old laptop once, and recently peed on the desk I use to work, aiming at my folder, which had countless annotations for my master's degree, and also splattering on my Kindle.\r  \n\r  \nI've pointed to BF a few times that maybe there's also some underlying health problem with the cat, and he's also not castrated. BF suggested that, since the cat has grown around a dog who used hygienic carpets, maybe he acquired the habit, and have been saying that he'll look into it anyway, but putting it off. He won't accept my help, though, bc he feels it's his obligation.\r  \n\r  \nI'll add that I'm a cat person. I've grown around cats and currently have 2 I adopted myself and would also be moving with me. And BFs cat is super cute and friendly; I really adore him, when I'm not cleaning off pee or sniffing around the sofa to make sure I won't sit on it.\r  \n\r  \nHere's where I may be TA: when he asked me to move in with him (his place is arguably nicer and the town is better), I said no. He was obviously hurt and I explained that I do want to live with him, but I don't want to deal with the cat's pee 24/7. I said that he has to sort this out first and I am more than willing to help, but I wouldn't risk my cats learning this kind of behavior anyway. \r  \n\r  \nI could see that he was hurt, and I'm feeling bad for upsetting him.

There's really no reason for him *not* to have dealt with this already. And honestly, it's humiliating to realize while at work (or in public anywhere) that everyone smells piss on you because your cat sprayed your shoes. Why put yourself in that situation? This is not a small problem, and it's really concerning that your BF is ignoring the issue.\n\n>I said that he has to sort this out first and I am more than willing to help, but I wouldn't risk my cats learning this kind of behavior anyway. \n\nYour approach is 100% the correct one. Stick to it! This cat needs to be assessed by a vet.", "NTA, I had cats, and all were litter trained. When one of my cats picked up that behavior, I got him neutered, and he stopped. Your bf doesn't seem to care about his things and is coming off as a red flag. I would give him an ultimatum, either he trains his cat to use a litter box and neuters him or you don't move in. If wants to he will makes those changes. He's an adult he should know better. Idk it's a red flag for me.", "NTA \n\nWhy on earth hasn\u2019t he neutered his cat? That is one of the biggest drivers behind this kind of issue, and he\u2019s a fool if he doesn\u2019t know that. \n\nIf you let them continue that behavior and don\u2019t neuter them before the habit develops, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t stop\u2026 sounds like the cat is old enough that it has a fixed habit now.", "I'm a cat lover and I have 4 cats. But I've had a \"pee cat\" in the past and, after thousands of dollars spent on different litters, vets, cleaning and even new furniture/carpet, on top of the damage deposits I lost from cat pee, I ultimately surrendered the cat. I just can't. \n\nIt is COMPLETELY reasonable to refuse to live in a house that reeks of cat pee and where an unneutered animal pees all over everything. The only thing you'll ever get out of it is ruined items and bills for damage (and the stress and frustration of dealing with it). The BF can fix this situation by either treating the cat or giving it up. As long as he lets it continue, he's making his place uninhabitable. His refusal to deal with it is going to cost him enormous amounts of money. Don't make this your problem.", "NTA. Cat urine is entirely unsanitary. It's not safe for you or him or any of the cats. He's actually a huge AH for not taking care of his cat by going to a vet and by neglecting to have his cat fixed and by not cleaning up the urine properly (he needs an enzymatic cleaner). Moving in with him could cause your cats to stop using the litter box as well, so you're being responsible by keeping them out of that mess.", " NTA you will start to stink and be the stinky cat pee lady if you move in there.", "NTA. Your response is entirely reasonable, understandable, and rational. His choice to not deal with the cat\u2019s prolific peeing, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of that. The dude needs to wake up and smell the ammonia. \n\nIt is not normal behaviour for a cat to so consistently pee outside its litter box. You are absolutely correct that a possible health issue may be at play, and this must be investigated by a vet. \n\nThe other factor could be the litter box. Does he clean it at least twice per day? Is it located in a suitable area that is private, clean, and safe from interruptions? \n\nThis cat is sending a very clear signal that something is not okay, and you are wise to not bring your two cats into the situation until his cat\u2019s issues are resolved.", "NTA but how you deliver your message is important. You sound thoughtful and considerate enough based off your thorough explanation in the post.\n\nI'd just reassure my partner that I do want to move in together and I'm excited for when we can. So in essence you're not saying no, you're saying that you guys need to get your affairs in order before the cohabitation can occur. That would be my recommendation. It's positive and affirmative.", "I don't blame you for not wanting to live in a Petrie dish or a litterbox. NTA. People with unmanaged pet soiling don't always understand that this really is a big, nasty deal to some of us. They love their pets and think of these things as little inconveniences that are easily rectified.\n\nUnfortunately, whatever is making this poor creature soil throughout the house has gone uncorrected for so long that it might just be something that isn't ever going to change? Who knows? Has a vet been consulted?\n\nI love certain aspects of my life - and being cat pee free is one of them. So, again, NTA. Your BF isn't giving you any incentive to move in to motivate you to change.", "Nta - if he isn\u2019t fixed some of it could be spray. If you have a male it will cause a ton of issues sand even if you don\u2019t it will be a whole thing to move you\u2019re creatures into those smells. Also if it isn\u2019t just spraying it could be a uti which get crazy serious.", "He has a 4yo entire male cat??? I'm not even joking, that is cruel. Neuter the cat.", "NTA.  Even a little.  Your reluctance here is 100% valid.  He can be hurt all he wants but your reasoning is solid.  Your post is the other side of the coin where people move in and THEN say \"Okay, time to get rid of the cat, it pees on stuff.\"  THAT would be an AH move.  You are being prudent and thoughtful.", "We live with a cat with litter box issues. He's my son's cat or he would have been gone a LONG TIME AGO. \n\nWhen the cat takes his Reconcile every day (which, I kid you not, is meat flavored Prozac) he's fine!  Goes in his box.... great to be around.\n\nWhen he doesn't get his meat popsicle every day he pees in the middle of the dining table.  But he's still great to be around. \n\nNTA and absolutely the right thing to do about drawing the boundary with the BF.", "NTA but cats can live like 20 years, so if you want any kind of relationship with him for the future, you may not be living together for a very, very long time if the problem is not solved.", "NTA. Nobody wants to move to Cat Pee Palace. That's DISGUSTING.", "NTA - you don't want to live in a pee house, which is perfectly reasonable. The fact that your BF does and is fine with it is a red flag.", "NTA. But taking your age in consideration, you only have three good child bearing years left. Pregnancies after 35 are considered geriatric pregnancies and are high risk. \n\nIF you desire children with this man, you should ask him to solve the cat piss issue in some manner upon you moving. After you move in and if it continues, plead to him to be a man of his word and give hints of some possible solutions that seem humane to the two of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We had a cat that did that they had crystals in his urine. Have him take kitty in for a urinalysis. Maybe some antibiotics can help clear it up.", "nope nope nope nope nope nope \n\nNTA\n\nStand your ground. Cats live forever and this is a gross problem that isn't going to solve itself.", "Do NOT move in with him until the cat issue is resolved... for reals. \n\nMy DH had a male cat that was originally a stray. He's fixed but since we got married I've had to throw away soo much stuff... including my 2 favorite leather chairs. \ud83d\ude1e \n I will not buy any furniture until he is gone and with us that means when he dies of old age. \n\nThere's not enough Natures Miracle in the world when you have a cat pissing/spraying in your house.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I\u2019m a cat person too. My old roommate had a cat who she didn\u2019t get fixed right away, and he ended up spraying everywhere. It was disgusting. You could smell our apartment when approaching down the \nhall. You are absolutely right to not want to live like that. I was miserable for awhile in that situation.", "> I've pointed to BF a few times that maybe there's also some underlying health problem with the cat, **and he's also not castrated.**\n\nESH.\n\nGET THE CAT FIXED.\n\nHe's spraying because he wants to fuck, get him fixed and he'll stop, issue resolved.", "NTA. You are very honest with him and that's what relationships need to survive. In telling him the truth he now has to take it upon him to do something about it if he truly wants you to move in with him", "NTA. This is what intact toms do, they spray. Everywhere. And if there are females outside in heat? They do it more.  And once they learn they can mess outside the litter box? It's harder than heck to break that habit since their scent is all over the house (so good luck with that). I don't blame you in the least for not wanting to live with Mr. PeepeeCat.", "NTA and your boyfriends NEEDS to get the cat neutered. Intact male cats 'spray' to mark their territory/ get their scent on things (thats why it shot it directly at your folder). If you move in that cat is going to spray on every single thing you own to get its scent on it. \nI cannot stress enough that this cat needs to be neutered. I cant even imagine walking into a place with a 4yr old intact cat that smell would be horrific.", "NTA: I'm a pet person, but any animal should not be allowed to pee on everything. You're right it could be a medical problem. It also is a matter of retraining the cat and making sure the litter box is clean and accessible. \n\nYou're not asking him to get rid of the cat, but to take care of the problem.", "NTA. It's a tough situation to be in. The cat seems too young to be that way. If he's marking it might be too late for desexing him to change that. My mum's cat got on antidepressants because he was spraying a lot. But he was an anxious cat and it was a bit later in his life. The pills did stop the spraying however. They also pee everywhere when they have uti's and such so don't let him be lazy about it- It's definitely in his interest to look into this. I'd personally not live in a situation like that so I don't think you're an AH... But if you don't, your bf's only option might be to get rid of the cat for good. (And as no one would likely take on a cat that pees everywhere, I dare say he'd get put down) Could you be the person who gave that ultimatum? Could you live separately in a relationship for the 12 or so years the cat has left to live? Tough situation.", "NTA I grew up in a house where cats peed on anything and everything, I got made fun of for smelling like pee it was awful. He needs to fix the problem asap and he probably needs to throw out most of his stuff if it can\u2019t be cleaned.", "NTA its fine if it hurts his feelings. A person being hurt by a reasonable boundary doesn't make it less reasonable and there are few things more reasonable than \"I don't want to live with a cat that pees on everything\"", "Honestly, even if you were able to ignore the situation (if), bringing your own cats into the place would make it worse because he'd want to mark his territory even more.\n\nCat needs neutering; it's probably too late for that to stop the behaviour but he should have been neutered 3.5 years ago. Boyfriend needs to look into getting some Feliway or whatever exists where you are, have at least two litter trays, and start using vinegar to clean everything. He also needs to get the cat checked over by a vet. Ideally at the same time the cat is neutered.", "Plus if OP moves in with his two cats, it will make the situation worse because the current cat will start marking his territory more aggressively. \nCats would also have to be introduced slowly.\nNTA", "I think auto correct got you?", "I'm sorry, not to be a dick but does it say anywhere that she wants kids? I missed it if she did. Like, what was the point in mentioning her chances of having kids if you don't even know that she wants any?", "I think you're right. I recently had a comvo with my mom about pets. I grew up with 3 cats and 3 dogs my whole life plus some at various times. She asked when I'd get pets for myself, my partner and kid. I told her never because 3 years without a dog or cat in the house has opened my eyes to less smells lmao. She asked if her house my childhood home) smells. I told her that honestly it's a brick wall when you walk in and next thing I know she's tearing up that musty carpet, I know she felt judged but I can't imagine her nose and sinuses or the other pets are complaining", "? Huh? Every word is correct.", "What\u2019s an \u201centire\u201d male cat? Can a male cat be half male or must it be entirely male?", "\"Entire\" when referring to a male animal means dick & balls intact... it is an \"entire\" male.\n\nBull - entire male cow. / Steer - castrated male cow\n\nRam - entire male sheep. / Weather - castrated male sheep.\n\nColt/Stallion - entire male horse. / Gelding - castrated male horse.\n\n.. and I just remembered the cat term is Tom..", "TIL! I didn\u2019t know this at all. \n\nDoes castration in this context mean cutting off everything?", "Wether, but I suspect autocorrect did get you this time!", "I thought the term was \"entact\"", "Nah just the berries"]}
