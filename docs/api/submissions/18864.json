He uses his litterbox, but he's also peed on countless cloths, clothes and shoes. He pees on every rug availabe and has peed on the sofa. The house has that distinct ammonia smell underlying everything most of the time. He's peed on an old laptop once, and recently peed on the desk I use to work, aiming at my folder, which had countless annotations for my master's degree, and also splattering on my Kindle.\r  \n\r  \nI've pointed to BF a few times that maybe there's also some underlying health problem with the cat, and he's also not castrated. BF suggested that, since the cat has grown around a dog who used hygienic carpets, maybe he acquired the habit, and have been saying that he'll look into it anyway, but putting it off. He won't accept my help, though, bc he feels it's his obligation.\r  \n\r  \nI'll add that I'm a cat person. I've grown around cats and currently have 2 I adopted myself and would also be moving with me.

There's really no reason for him *not* to have dealt with this already. And honestly, it's humiliating to realize while at work (or in public anywhere) that everyone smells piss on you because your cat sprayed your shoes. Why put yourself in that situation? This is not a small problem, and it's really concerning that your BF is ignoring the issue.\n\n>I said that he has to sort this out first and I am more than willing to help, but I wouldn't risk my cats learning this kind of behavior anyway. \n\nYour approach is 100% the correct one. Stick to it! This cat needs to be assessed by a vet.", "NTA, I had cats, and all were litter trained. When one of my cats picked up that behavior, I got him neutered, and he stopped. Your bf doesn't seem to care about his things and is coming off as a red flag. I would give him an ultimatum, either he trains his cat to use a litter box and neuters him or you don't move in. If wants to he will makes those changes. He's an adult he should know better. Idk it's a red flag for me.", "NTA \n\nWhy on earth hasn\u2019t he neutered his cat? That is one of the biggest drivers behind this kind of issue, and he\u2019s a fool if he doesn\u2019t know that. \n\nIf you let them continue that behavior and don\u2019t neuter them before the habit develops, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t stop\u2026 sounds like the cat is old enough that it has a fixed habit now.", "I'm a cat lover and I have 4 cats. But I've had a \"pee cat\" in the past and, after thousands of dollars spent on different litters, vets, cleaning and even new furniture/carpet, on top of the damage deposits I lost from cat pee, I ultimately surrendered the cat. I just can't. \n\nIt is COMPLETELY reasonable to refuse to live in a house that reeks of cat pee and where an unneutered animal pees all over everything. The only thing you'll ever get out of it is ruined items and bills for damage (and the stress and frustration of dealing with it). The BF can fix this situation by either treating the cat or giving it up. As long as he lets it continue, he's making his place uninhabitable. His refusal to deal with it is going to cost him enormous amounts of money. Don't make this your problem.", "NTA. Cat urine is entirely unsanitary. It's not safe for you or him or any of the cats. He's actually a huge AH for not taking care of his cat by going to a vet and by neglecting to have his cat fixed and by not cleaning up the urine properly (he needs an enzymatic cleaner). Moving in with him could cause your cats to stop using the litter box as well, so you're being responsible by keeping them out of that mess.", " NTA you will start to stink and be the stinky cat pee lady if you move in there.", "NTA. Your response is entirely reasonable, understandable, and rational. His choice to not deal with the cat\u2019s prolific peeing, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of that. The dude needs to wake up and smell the ammonia. \n\nIt is not normal behaviour for a cat to so consistently pee outside its litter box. You are absolutely correct that a possible health issue may be at play, and this must be investigated by a vet. \n\nThe other factor could be the litter box. Does he clean it at least twice per day? Is it located in a suitable area that is private, clean, and safe from interruptions? \n\nThis cat is sending a very clear signal that something is not okay, and you are wise to not bring your two cats into the situation until his cat\u2019s issues are resolved.", "NTA but how you deliver your message is important. You sound thoughtful and considerate enough based off your thorough explanation in the post.\n\nI'd just reassure my partner that I do want to move in together and I'm excited for when we can. So in essence you're not saying no, you're saying that you guys need to get your affairs in order before the cohabitation can occur. That would be my recommendation. It's positive and affirmative.", "I don't blame you for not wanting to live in a Petrie dish or a litterbox. NTA. People with unmanaged pet soiling don't always understand that this really is a big, nasty deal to some of us. They love their pets and think of these things as little inconveniences that are easily rectified.\n\nUnfortunately, whatever is making this poor creature soil throughout the house has gone uncorrected for so long that it might just be something that isn't ever going to change? Who knows? Has a vet been consulted?\n\nI love certain aspects of my life - and being cat pee free is one of them. So, again, NTA. Your BF isn't giving you any incentive to move in to motivate you to change.", "Nta - if he isn\u2019t fixed some of it could be spray. If you have a male it will cause a ton of issues sand even if you don\u2019t it will be a whole thing to move you\u2019re creatures into those smells. Also if it isn\u2019t just spraying it could be a uti which get crazy serious.", "He has a 4yo entire male cat??? I'm not even joking, that is cruel. Neuter the cat.", "NTA.  Even a little.  Your reluctance here is 100% valid.  He can be hurt all he wants but your reasoning is solid.  Your post is the other side of the coin where people move in and THEN say \"Okay, time to get rid of the cat, it pees on stuff.\"  THAT would be an AH move.  You are being prudent and thoughtful.", "We live with a cat with litter box issues. He's my son's cat or he would have been gone a LONG TIME AGO. \n\nWhen the cat takes his Reconcile every day (which, I kid you not, is meat flavored Prozac) he's fine!  Goes in his box.... great to be around.\n\nWhen he doesn't get his meat popsicle every day he pees in the middle of the dining table.  But he's still great to be around. \n\nNTA and absolutely the right thing to do about drawing the boundary with the BF.", "NTA but cats can live like 20 years, so if you want any kind of relationship with him for the future, you may not be living together for a very, very long time if the problem is not solved.", "NTA. Nobody wants to move to Cat Pee Palace. That's DISGUSTING.", "NTA - you don't want to live in a pee house, which is perfectly reasonable. The fact that your BF does and is fine with it is a red flag.", "NTA. But taking your age in consideration, you only have three good child bearing years left. Pregnancies after 35 are considered geriatric pregnancies and are high risk. \n\nIF you desire children with this man, you should ask him to solve the cat piss issue in some manner upon you moving.

And if there are females outside in heat? They do it more.  And once they learn they can mess outside the litter box?

I don't blame you in the least for not wanting to live with Mr. PeepeeCat.", "NTA and your boyfriends NEEDS to get the cat neutered. Intact male cats 'spray' to mark their territory/ get their scent on things (thats why it shot it directly at your folder). If you move in that cat is going to spray on every single thing you own to get its scent on it. \nI cannot stress enough that this cat needs to be neutered. I cant even imagine walking into a place with a 4yr old intact cat that smell would be horrific.", "NTA: I'm a pet person, but any animal should not be allowed to pee on everything. You're right it could be a medical problem. It also is a matter of retraining the cat and making sure the litter box is clean and accessible. \n\nYou're not asking him to get rid of the cat, but to take care of the problem.", "NTA. It's a tough situation to be in. The cat seems too young to be that way. If he's marking it might be too late for desexing him to change that. My mum's cat got on antidepressants because he was spraying a lot. But he was an anxious cat and it was a bit later in his life. The pills did stop the spraying however. They also pee everywhere when they have uti's and such so don't let him be lazy about it- It's definitely in his interest to look into this. I'd personally not live in a situation like that so I don't think you're an AH... But if you don't, your bf's only option might be to get rid of the cat for good. (And as no one would likely take on a cat that pees everywhere, I dare say he'd get put down) Could you be the person who gave that ultimatum? Could you live separately in a relationship for the 12 or so years the cat has left to live? Tough situation.", "NTA I grew up in a house where cats peed on anything and everything, I got made fun of for smelling like pee it was awful. He needs to fix the problem asap and he probably needs to throw out most of his stuff if it can\u2019t be cleaned.", "NTA its fine if it hurts his feelings.

Boyfriend needs to look into getting some Feliway or whatever exists where you are, have at least two litter trays, and start using vinegar to clean everything. He also needs to get the cat checked over by a vet.

I recently had a comvo with my mom about pets. I grew up with 3 cats and 3 dogs my whole life plus some at various times. She asked when I'd get pets for myself, my partner and kid. I told her never because 3 years without a dog or cat in the house has opened my eyes to less smells lmao. She asked if her house my childhood home) smells.

This man couldn't eveb be bothered to neuter him and doesn't care at the possibility of the cat having health issues", "NTA.. I don't really want to do that either because I like my personal space", "NTA, but this is not a learned behavior or a lack of litter training and most likely not a health issue. An unfixed male cat will naturally and instinctively mark it's territory. The reality of the situation is that it's not a hygenic or pleasant living situation. That is a fixable issue that can be addressed, and needs to be addressed.", "NTA but he should take his cat to the vet because this is indicative of a UTI or other underlying condition. Perhaps even anxiety. I've had cats my whole life and when they act out like this it's cuz something is off with them. \n\nTry getting a second or 3rd litter box and put them I'm the major \"go to\" areas he pees in. And also get him fixed. It's actually stressful for cats who have not been fixed cuz they're sort of a slave to their reproductive system. For male cats it's usually an overwhelming instinct for them to \"mark their territory\"", "NTA - You have to do what's right for you.   It speaks volumes that he would let this animal do that to the place he lives.     I know you have no desire to hurt him, but I don't blame you.

Tell him why and tell him you don't want to go around smelling of cat piss because he can't sort his shit out.

So, this is a choice for your BF; he can fix the cat or he can live with you.  \n\nWhat if things get more serious and you decide to have children?  Do you want them exposed to urine-splattered surfaces?  EEEeeewwww - I don't think so.\n\nI have always had my cats castrated as soon as they are old enough.  Because of the marking issues and what if they got loose outside?  I don't want to be the cause of more unwanted kittens being born.  \n\nI don't know if castrating a grown cat will fix this problem, but it is a step in the right direction.  How would the BF go about getting rid of the stinky pee-soaked things in his apartment?  Ideally, if only the litter box smells like cat urine, then the cat will only pee there.  Besides, when the BF moves out he is going to be hit with a huge bill for cleaning and replaced damaged items.", "NTA for not wanting to move into that peepee palace.

This is a legitimate issue that he needs to not only sort out for you. But sort out for himself. Because not only is he allowing everything of his to get destroyed. But if you can smell cat piss when you are at his place, you might be used to his scent, but everyone else will quickly discover he smells like cat piss.\n\nAnd ultimately you guys have been together for 4 years, and you aren't getting any younger.

Most likely there\u2019s nothing wrong with him, and your only hope is to get him neutered and retrained.  And the house cleaned.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never seen a male cat spray, it literally shoots urine straight out behind him, like a fire hose, and it easily can reach 2-3 feet.  That house is soaked in urine and will take professional cleaning.", "Since the cat is not fixed it may actually be spraying which also smell horrible", "Right and by now tbh even if the cat is neutered, it might be a habit of his to spray everything", "This guy can't be bothered to get him neutered and doesn't care about the cat's potential for health problems", "Right? Who just lets their cat live in piss? Who lives in piss with their cat? Hugely neglectful. OP is entirely in the right, NTA. But bf is a huge AH for neglecting his cat like that. \n\nGood for her for standing her ground, honestly. Maybe it\u2019ll be the thing that makes him take care of that poor cat.", "Ideally at the same time the cat is neutered.", "I had temporarily moved back home from out of state many years ago.\n\nMy dad had a cat who did this.  He didn't bother to tell me a damn thing about it before I moved in because it was something he saw as, basically, a non-issue.  Like OP, I am also a cat person.  I'd actually come with two (very well trained) cats of my own.\n\nWhen I walked in the front door for the first time in half a decade, the smell of cat urine was OVERWHELMING.  It was absolutely nauseating.  It was from not just one, but two cats.  When my sister had come home with a kitten who just never got into the habit of using the litter box, the cat who I KNEW (we got him when I was 10) used to use it stopped. \n\nAfter a few months went by, I, like my dad, no longer noticed the smell.  The only times I realized my clothes or bedding or anything else had been urinated on was when I saw them either still wet or stained.  I didn't realize until I moved out that I had most likely been living my life reeking of cat urine.\n\nETA:  Thinking and typing about this now, I can smell the cat urine.  I moved out seven years ago.  It's an extremely distinct smell to which I became totally oblivious for months due to prolonged, continuous exposure"]}
