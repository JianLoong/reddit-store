We've been together for about 4 years and I love him very much, he's the kindest, handsomest, funniest man I've even known.\n\nThe thing is, he's got a 4yo cat that likes to pee on stuff. He uses his litterbox, but he's also peed on countless cloths, clothes and shoes. He pees on every rug availabe and has peed on the sofa. The house has that distinct ammonia smell underlying everything most of the time. He's peed on an old laptop once, and recently peed on the desk I use to work, aiming at my folder, which had countless annotations for my master's degree, and also splattering on my Kindle.\n\nI've pointed to BF a few times that maybe there's also some underlying health problem with the cat, and he's also not castrated. BF suggested that, since the cat has grown around a dog who used hygienic carpets, maybe he acquired the habit, and have been saying that he'll look into it anyway, but putting it off. He won't accept my help, though, bc he feels it's his obligation.\n\nI'll add that I'm a cat person. I've grown around cats and currently have 2 I adopted myself and would also be moving with me. And BFs cat is super cute and friendly; I really adore him, when I'm not cleaning off pee or sniffing around the sofa to make sure I won't sit on it.\n\nHere's where I may be TA: when he asked me to move in with him (his place is arguably nicer and the town is better), I said no. He was obviously hurt and I explained that I do want to live with him, but I don't want to deal with the cat's pee 24/7. I said that he has to sort this out first and I am more than willing to help, but I wouldn't risk my cats learning this kind of behavior anyway.\n\nI could see that he was hurt, and I'm feeling bad for upsetting him. However, I don't think it's an unreasonable request. Reddit, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit** \\- Wow, did not expect! Thank you everyone who chimed in! I will be more assertive about neutering & seeing the vet tomorrow, when we'll meet. I just wanted to add - in my country, neutering pets is definitely not common sense, and most people believe only strays have to be fixed as to not enlarge the number of animals on the street. But pets? Not really. Also, there's still the (absolutely idiotic and bonkers) belief that male animals would lose their masculinity, I kid you not. Saying this to clarify that it's not a given that BF or anyone would spray their pets here; I did, because I've worked on a rescue during uni. BF is not \\*against\\* it but is still kinda oblivious, even after literal years of me \\*suggesting\\* otherwise, at how much it really matters for the cat's welfare. Dogs are also the preferred pet by far so correct info on cat's health is also not that widely availabe; the cat has a vet, but she's... lacking, IMO. Like I said, I will be more assertive, because I did expect that by now he would have taken care of it.

There's really no reason for him *not* to have dealt with this already. And honestly, it's humiliating to realize while at work (or in public anywhere) that everyone smells piss on you because your cat sprayed your shoes. Why put yourself in that situation? This is not a small problem, and it's really concerning that your BF is ignoring the issue.\n\n>I said that he has to sort this out first and I am more than willing to help, but I wouldn't risk my cats learning this kind of behavior anyway. \n\nYour approach is 100% the correct one. Stick to it! This cat needs to be assessed by a vet.", "NTA, I had cats, and all were litter trained. When one of my cats picked up that behavior, I got him neutered, and he stopped. Your bf doesn't seem to care about his things and is coming off as a red flag. I would give him an ultimatum, either he trains his cat to use a litter box and neuters him or you don't move in. If wants to he will makes those changes. He's an adult he should know better. Idk it's a red flag for me.", "NTA \n\nWhy on earth hasn\u2019t he neutered his cat? That is one of the biggest drivers behind this kind of issue, and he\u2019s a fool if he doesn\u2019t know that. \n\nIf you let them continue that behavior and don\u2019t neuter them before the habit develops, there\u2019s a good chance they won\u2019t stop\u2026 sounds like the cat is old enough that it has a fixed habit now.", "I'm a cat lover and I have 4 cats. But I've had a \"pee cat\" in the past and, after thousands of dollars spent on different litters, vets, cleaning and even new furniture/carpet, on top of the damage deposits I lost from cat pee, I ultimately surrendered the cat. I just can't. \n\nIt is COMPLETELY reasonable to refuse to live in a house that reeks of cat pee and where an unneutered animal pees all over everything. The only thing you'll ever get out of it is ruined items and bills for damage (and the stress and frustration of dealing with it). The BF can fix this situation by either treating the cat or giving it up. As long as he lets it continue, he's making his place uninhabitable. His refusal to deal with it is going to cost him enormous amounts of money. Don't make this your problem.", "NTA. Cat urine is entirely unsanitary. It's not safe for you or him or any of the cats. He's actually a huge AH for not taking care of his cat by going to a vet and by neglecting to have his cat fixed and by not cleaning up the urine properly (he needs an enzymatic cleaner). Moving in with him could cause your cats to stop using the litter box as well, so you're being responsible by keeping them out of that mess.", " NTA you will start to stink and be the stinky cat pee lady if you move in there.", "NTA. Your response is entirely reasonable, understandable, and rational. His choice to not deal with the cat\u2019s prolific peeing, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of that. The dude needs to wake up and smell the ammonia. \n\nIt is not normal behaviour for a cat to so consistently pee outside its litter box. You are absolutely correct that a possible health issue may be at play, and this must be investigated by a vet. \n\nThe other factor could be the litter box. Does he clean it at least twice per day? Is it located in a suitable area that is private, clean, and safe from interruptions? \n\nThis cat is sending a very clear signal that something is not okay, and you are wise to not bring your two cats into the situation until his cat\u2019s issues are resolved.", "NTA but how you deliver your message is important. You sound thoughtful and considerate enough based off your thorough explanation in the post.\n\nI'd just reassure my partner that I do want to move in together and I'm excited for when we can. So in essence you're not saying no, you're saying that you guys need to get your affairs in order before the cohabitation can occur. That would be my recommendation. It's positive and affirmative.", "I don't blame you for not wanting to live in a Petrie dish or a litterbox. NTA.

Who knows? Has a vet been consulted?\n\nI love certain aspects of my life - and being cat pee free is one of them. So, again, NTA. Your BF isn't giving you any incentive to move in to motivate you to change.", "Nta - if he isn\u2019t fixed some of it could be spray. If you have a male it will cause a ton of issues sand even if you don\u2019t it will be a whole thing to move you\u2019re creatures into those smells. Also if it isn\u2019t just spraying it could be a uti which get crazy serious.", "He has a 4yo entire male cat??? I'm not even joking, that is cruel. Neuter the cat.", "NTA.  Even a little.  Your reluctance here is 100% valid.  He can be hurt all he wants but your reasoning is solid.  Your post is the other side of the coin where people move in and THEN say \"Okay, time to get rid of the cat, it pees on stuff.\"  THAT would be an AH move.  You are being prudent and thoughtful.", "We live with a cat with litter box issues. He's my son's cat or he would have been gone a LONG TIME AGO. \n\nWhen the cat takes his Reconcile every day (which, I kid you not, is meat flavored Prozac) he's fine!  Goes in his box.... great to be around.\n\nWhen he doesn't get his meat popsicle every day he pees in the middle of the dining table.  But he's still great to be around. \n\nNTA and absolutely the right thing to do about drawing the boundary with the BF.", "NTA but cats can live like 20 years, so if you want any kind of relationship with him for the future, you may not be living together for a very, very long time if the problem is not solved.", "NTA.
