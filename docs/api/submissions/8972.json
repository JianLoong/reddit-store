I have 3 half siblings from my fathers second marriage, ages 44 male, 42 female, and 41 female. In October, my father married his third wife, Jane (not her real name), who is the same age as my youngest sister, 41. A little oogy but I try to be respectful because this is who my father chose to spend his final days with. Jane has two children, 1 of whom I and my siblings have never met, and the other whom has severe jealousy issues and has tried to come between my father and his biological children. My father was not a big part of our lives as he was in prison from the time I was 12 and when he was released on parole, he had demons to fight. We had just recently begun to repair our relationship. On New Year\u2019s Day, he passed away by himself in the VA hospital because Jane refused to take him to the hospital because she was tired so his roommate took him and dropped him off. I am in Texas, they are in Kansas or i would have been there. No one called me until he was gone. It took three weeks to get him cremated because he had no life insurance and she claimed to not have any money and I am the only income in my home currently. After I set up a gofundme and raised funds for his cremation, I found out she received a$150k settlement in November and just felt that as his oldest child, it was my responsibility to take care of things. Now, the issue. We finally got a copy of the obituary yesterday and I am livid. My name, my brothers name, and my nephews name are misspelled even though we verified the spellings with Jane prior to publication. She listed her children as our siblings and placed them above us even though they are younger. She left off two of my children. She put HER mother as predeceased above HIS mother and father. This is the final record of my fathers life and I feel it should be corrected. She claims the funeral home will not do the corrections.

My husband feels that I should let it go so I can grieve my father and heal but I do not feel that I can heal with these inaccuracies in his final record. I have reached out to other family members but they are staying out of it. My siblings and I are the only ones who see what she did as an insult to us and my father.

Everyone grieves in their own way. \n\nYou could also probably have the obituary you wrote published in your home town and his hometown paper. as well as the VA newsletter. \n\nI lost both my parents and there were corrections on both their obits. We got them fixed as soon as we could. its just wrong to have the final words be incorrect.", "NTA - definitely put together a correct obituary and have it published and available.

Definitely NTA. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. First, I am so sorry for the loss of your father and for having to deal with this mess at the same time your mourn.  Should you write a second obit? Yes. Do it.  She didn\u2019t take him to the hospital.  She didn\u2019t make a phone call or text you and/or your siblings so you could call or go see him. She didn\u2019t even go with the friend to take him to the VA?  WOW! She\u2019s a doozy. YES, OP. Write a corrected obit and have it ready for the funeral.  I might be checking to see if Jane should pay for funeral with the money she was left instead having to use GoFundMe.  OP, I am glad your siblings have you during this time."]}
