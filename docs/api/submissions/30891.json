He's only paid down his debts because you've been supervising. And the moment he has to make a financial decision without your advice, he fucked it up spectacularly. You are wasting your time here. He'll never be a financially viable partner. \n\nbtw, as you probably know,  depending on your local laws, the moment you marry, YOU would become liable for that 14k too.", "NTA. Ugh!!!!", "NTA! I thought this entire thing was going somewhere else. You seem to have quite different views on finances and how to manage money. Not sure I'd want to join assets with someone who thinks spending 14k on a ring is necessary or normal. Especially as he apparently hasn't that kind of money just lying around.", "NTA. it seems that he misunderstood your point of financial planning. i think it's completley justified but a convo would be benefited i think :))", "NTA\nHe has no concept of money and would still be in debt without uou spoonfeeding him.  You will be his financial advisor for the rest of your life.", "NTA - you have priorities, which you\u2019ve made incredibly clear from the beginning, and then he proves how little he cares when it suits him.", "NTA, he could get you a beautiful ring for much cheaper with a lab created diamond.", "NTA.\n\nI can understand where you're coming from.\nif it was me, I would think that my partner, who supposed to know me, perhaps better than anybody,  does something he claims to be for me while it goes completely against what I want (and what we agreed on).\n\nit's like if my bf proposed in a public place in front of a bunch of people,  I would've said no because the last thing I want, as an introvert, is a public proposal. why would I marry you if you don't know/respect something so basic about me?\n\nI feel like your case is along the same line just way more extreme since 14k$ is a SHIT TON of money for something you don't need or want.", "YTA because of your response. Marriage and partnership is about communication. You could\u2019ve said something like \u2018let\u2019s return it for a more economical choice,\u2019 but instead you\u2019re threatening to leave because you\u2019re upset with his choice. There will always be choices with marriage and sometimes you\u2019ll disagree but you shouldn\u2019t give your partner insecurity by threatening to leave. Have a conversation. Clearly he listens to you but sometimes he gets it wrong but a conversation can fix that.", "Part of being ready for marriage is learning to recognise and deliver appreciation and care to your partner the way *they* appreciate it, not *you*. NTA.", "Yta", "I'd say NAH\n\nHe wanted to make a grand gesture, and was willing to suffer for it, you did not want a grand gesture, you wanted financial stability instead. You both clearly, after six years, still don't appreciate and value these aspects of the other person's nature. It is very unlikely that, long term, you will be able to live with the kind of economical insecurity he will bring, and he will not be able to live with the kind of economical limitations you want to live within. It is just not a good fit, and it's a good thing you learned this now.", "YTA, you\u2019ve been together a long time now, you\u2019ve worked on issues together as a committed couple should. He should have discussed the ring with you ahead of time but many issues come up when you pledge to live your lives together and I don\u2019t think what you\u2019ve done is fair. Threatening your entire relationship because he made a decision that you don\u2019t agree with is abusive. Work together to find a solution, tell him you appreciate the sentiment but you\u2019d rather have a something else to symbolize your love. I feel sorry for him, whatever you get it will always remind him of how awful you are.", "14k on a ring... Jesus it must have been a sparkler. I agree with you though that's insane", "NTA.\n\nEven though he has come a long way, this shows he is still financially irresponsible.

Normally I know what my judgement is right away, but not this time.\n\nI can understand both sides of the story. You are justified in your anger for wanting to provide him and yourself with financial stability. It's very important in the future life you want to build.\n\nOn the other hand, he wanted you to feel special and have something to prove his love for you.\n\nI understand you're angry, but I wouldn't throw away your life together because of this mistake, especially when you said he managed his finances well for a while now. \n\nI would say that in this situation nobody is an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he can\u2019t buy it outright, from his own money, he can\u2019t afford it. And marrying a man who spends beyond his means is a *terrible* idea.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re giving it back because of the ring itself, but more what it symbolizes. \n\nBeing debt free and financially stable is vital to you, and you clearly don\u2019t feel the \u2018need\u2019 to be adorned with expensive stuff, especially not at the cost of going into debt.\n\nHe has completely DISREGUARDED what I assume he must know about you by now, after having spent 7 years together! \n\nSo\u2026 no I understand you, 100% not the AH.\n\nHowever\u2026 you are at risk of being an AH if you waste any more of this blokes time. Sounds like there may be a rather large compatability issue here, and you\u2019ve already sunk 7 years into this. How much more time do you want to waste hoping he\u2019ll come around to your way of thinking, or marrying him just to then argue with him over money for the rest of your life? \n\n\nThink about it this way; after everything you\u2019ve done, how you\u2019ve pushed him to become debt free etc etc, he\u2019s gone and still done a very irrisponsible thing. Okay he had the best of intentions, but no. Bad move. Is THIS the guy you\u2019re going to trust to be the financial breadwinner when you take leave to have children (assuming you want to) and potentially leave work all together to raise them? No? So why stay?", "His purchase of such an outrageously expensive ring on payments illustrated a fundamental difference in attitude towards money. In marriages, money is one of the top three reasons for divorce so, NTA for giving it back. 14k on a piece of jewelry is ridiculous.", "NTA. Good for you. \n\nThat's as tone-deaf as proposing to a vegan by hiding the ring in a steak.", "NTA His irrational, impulsive spending habits are exactly what got him into debt in the first place. He threw away all the hard work you had both done for the temporary high of giving you an extravagant ring. Plus, if he thought this was going to make you happy, he doesn't know you at all.", "NTA for asking him to become debt free and having boundaries but TA for the way you handled it.   You could have told him in a nice way to exchange the ring, but you went full terminator.   \n\nA marriage is not only about being financially responsible and working towards something bigger and better it's about love as well.  You need both of those things to make a marriage\\\\partnership work. \n\nESH", "NTA. Financial stability is waaay more important than a diamond. He\u2019ll probably end up paying 20k for that ring by the time it\u2019s paid off. It\u2019s concerning that he spent so long clearing his debt, then jumped straight back in for a ring. Granted, some women insist on getting a rock but it sounds like you CLEARLY never gave him that impression!", "NTA\n\nNever been a fan of jewelry that's worth thousands...", ">He proudly informs me that ot cost $14k\n\nWHO THE HELL SPENDS THAT ?! What for ?\n\n>he took from our savings\n\nHe took from your SHARED account a sum that large ? He emptied the damn savings account without talking to you first ? NTA NTA NTA !!!", "I don\u2019t think the two of you are financially compatible. You\u2019ve been together for years, he knows financial stability is important to you and he wasted 14k on a ring, that\u2019s a house down payment. He didn\u2019t want you to feel special, he wanted bragging rights.", "NTA 14K made me do a double take. I was sure it was 1.4K and even then I thought you weren't TA. 14K is getting close to house deposit money. It would certainly buy a fairly good used car outright. Even for someone who could afford it, that is a lot to spend on a ring. For someone who can't that is an absurd amount of money for a ring. A ring most people rarely wear once they get married. If he bought it on a payment plan then the interest is probably insane too. He will have paid a lot more than 14K by the end of it. I don't know how good the rest of your relationship is but it would need to be very good to make up for the the very large gap in the way you handle finances. You spent 7 years trying to fix this man. How many more before you learn you can't change other people?", "Wow. When i first read the title I thought \u201cdefinitely the AH\u201d but his behavior shows he 1) hasn\u2019t changed his financial ways and 2) doesn\u2019t listen to you. You said you didn\u2019t want to spend a lot, he blew it anyway. NTA.", "NTA. Well that's not what I expected. Well done though.", "NTA.\n\nYou had a non-negotiable and he broke your trust, so of course you're going to feel the way you did.\n\nOf course you're going to wonder if all that time you spent helping him was a waste, and worry that he'll never actually truly listen to you.\n\nMy wife and I were engaged way back in 2002, neither of us had a lot of money, we bought a ring together that I think was less than $300.\n\nBoth of us haven't worn our rings for well over a decade, as our rings got too tight to wear comfortably.\n\nThat $14k ring could end up in a drawer or on a necklace before too long if it ends up not being comfortable.\n\nIt seems like he has an unhealthy relationship with money, and he needs therapy to break it. Either that or (due to the pride he displayed), he has an unhealthy idea of power and relationships.", "NTA. While it was really cool of him to get you a nice ring, he should've known better than to overspend. It sounds like you've been really clear with him about the finances. \n\nThat being said, turning down his proposal rather than discussing how you'd really prefer him to return the ring and find something less expensive pretty much indicates that it might be time to seriously think about if he's the right guy for you.", "By getting married you would essentially be taking on the 14k debt.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You guys have been together for 6 years and he doesn\u2019t know you well enough to know that maybe he shouldn\u2019t go out and essentially put you both $14k in debt?! \nHe could\u2019ve gotten a gorgeous ring for a fraction of that cost. \nPoor financial responsibility like that is a big red flag. Don\u2019t marry into that or you\u2019ll be digging the both of you out of debt for the rest of your lives", "I\u2019m on the fence with this.  He got out of debt and then YOU asked about the ring.  You seem like you were subconsciously looking for an out.  You guys have been talking about marriage for 6 years.  Didn\u2019t you discuss what kind of ring you wanted, or at least the budget for one?  My, now husband, was the same as yours with money.  I don\u2019t have any clue how much he spent on the ring, but I know he picked it because he was only thinking of me.  I\u2019m going with soft YTA, because I know the struggle of being a frugal lady with a spending man.", "NTA - $14k for a ring when you have already expressed your concerns about financial responsibility is all about a status that he is trying to portray. Not to mention that there are tons of traditional style engagement rings that are suitable for a lifetime of daily wear that you can get for less than 10% of the cost. At $14k, best case scenario is he got a huge mined diamond at a fair market price, meaning he\u2019s spending money for the sake of it, as there is no molecular difference between mined and lab created diamonds. If it\u2019s not a huge mined rock, then it\u2019s even worse because then he\u2019s paying wayy above market value without even taking the time to comparison shop, which is even more irresponsible.", "Awww poor guy!!  He really did try to please you.  I wish you would have been nicer about it.  Like maybe, wow you know this is a really beautiful ring and I love the gesture, but man the cost of it makes  me nervous.  Maybe we could go to the store and pick out something more simple?  So I kinda think you were the AH for being mean about it.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not financially compatible \n\nIt\u2019s like he thinks he\u2019s paid off all his debt. So that\u2019s it job done. He\u2019s done what you asked. Now he can go back to who he is. Spend spend spend. \n\nHe\u2019s not listened to what you want. And I think you were perfectly clear. \n\nCut your losses and run", "NTA - He doesn't sound like he makes responsible financial decisions. \n\nMy wife's engagement ring cost \u00a3600 and I thought that was ridiculously expensive.\n\nIt's ultimately your decision whether or not to stay with someone who makes such poor financial decisions but if you do stay then I recommend taking him ring shopping and selecting a ring you like that you know you can both afford.", "NTA Not gonna lie, I thought this was going the opposite way. Wasting $14k plus interest, so probably more like $18k, on a baubel is not smart planning. That money could be used for so much more.", "14000 $! NTA. Does he not know you at all?", "Under normal circumstances, I would say you're being silly over a ring, but its very clear that he could not afford this ring, the cost of it was important to him for some weird status reasons and that you'd discussed your prioritisation of healthy finances. \n\nWith all of that, you're NTA. \n\nIt's like he listened to your objectives of healthy financial planning but never actually learnt anything about it.", "NTA\n\nI get it, he loves weddings but he needed to have saved that $14k before proposing. It\u2019s like he proved your fears about his ability to manage money with one gesture", "nta but ur husband was just trying", "NTA.\n\nYou spent *years* helping him work down his debt, and he finally became free, only to almost immediately send himself $14,000 back into debt for such a silly reason. 1k can still get you a very nice engagement ring, and you don\u2019t even need to spend that much.", "She would also be paying the debt too.\nShe would be the one trying to organise their finances to pay off $14k debt, maybe $20k all up including interest, maybe more depending where he got finance.\n\nShe had a non-negotiable and he broke her trust and of course she's going to worry that he'll never truly listen to her", ">Threatening your entire relationship because he made a decision that you don\u2019t agree with is abusive. \n\nShe just said that she rescinded the proposal and is \"re-thinking\". \n\nOne should ALWAYS be re-thinking their relationship, and she did not threaten the relationship, he did.\n\nAnd it wasn't just a decision she doesn't agree with, it was something that should never has crossed his mind if he had paid any attention until now. He should KNOW that she will not be happy with it. \n\nBasically, he is saying either.  \n1) I didn't listen to a word you said for the past years.\n\nor \n\n2) I heard what you said, know what you value, and I just don't care.\n\nIf that is not grounds for re-thinking, what is?", "You've got it backwards.\n\nShe had a non-negotiable and he broke her trust.\n\nHe has an unhealthy relationship with money, and be will likely keep racking up crazy amounts of debt that she will have to try and pay off, only for him to rack up more debt so he can feel proud and special.", "I would say he being financially abusive and reckless. And clearly financially untrustworthy. This is a nice soft approach but she has been supporting him for 6 years to pay off his debts and then goes and makes a 14k debt out of pride? I would be out of that relationship too I think she did well by sticking by him that long.", "My partner and I are at the ring stage. We\u2019ve communicated what we wanted and picked out designs we like with the stones and metal we want. Wouldn\u2019t come anywhere near $3k for a matching set.\n\nIf he comes back saying he spent over 10 grand on one ring I\u2019d probably lose my mind. That\u2019s a really decent vacation that could be spent making priceless memories.", "She\u2019s right to consider ending things. She said she wouldn\u2019t marry him until he got out of his consumer debt, and he got himself right back into a new debt to propose. This guy doesn\u2019t get it. He is going to keep making unsound financial decisions and OP shouldn\u2019t stick around if she doesn\u2019t want to be financially cleaning up after him every time. Working through issues is one thing, but no one wants to commit to working through the same issue over and over again because their partner won\u2019t learn.", "He didn't take it from their savings, though, he got it on payments.", "Plus the wedding debt!", "If only he had tried to actually listen to the woman he claims to love instead of breaking her trust", "IMHO that just makes it worse. Dont get me wrong, ignoring your girlfriends wishes is still wrong. But thinking this was going to make her happy after her one reason notto marry him earlier is a dislike of debt is just eeeeeeeeggghhh\u2026", "Oh you're right, I must have read too fast. Nonetheless, I stand by my judgement.", "It\u2019s easily done\u2026 you\u2019re right about the judgement though NTA."]}
