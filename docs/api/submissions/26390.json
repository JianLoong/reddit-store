{"id": 26390, "submission_id": "16cg1an", "title": "AITA for upholding my husband's ban on our son's friend?", "selftext": "My son, Sam (M17), has begun his last year of high school this fall. He's a smart and ambitious kid, and I'm certain he'll succeed in his studies, but his recent behavior has made me (F46) and his father (Ryan M46) worried. This worry stems from his close friendship with his classmate Stacey (F17).\n\nInitially, their relationship seemed like a regular friendship when it began back in February. However, Ryan and I did notice how he spent way more time with Stacey compared to his other friends, and she would come over to our house pretty often. We weren't exactly thrilled about Sam spending so much time with Stacey, and we made it very clear to him that his school obligations should not suffer as a result of the time he spends with her. He has always assured us that it wouldn't.\n\nThat being said, Sam's marks began to slide and when we told him about our concerns, he said that it wasn't Stacey's fault and that he was tired from his extracurriculars or that the material covered had become more challenging.\n\nDuring the summer, it became increasingly apparent that Sam's time and attention were disproportionately consumed by Stacey. Ryan told him that during the upcoming school year, he would need to focus primarily on his school work and that he should not waste time entertaining Stacey. He was upset with this and said that he could manage his time properly and that we shouldn't worry about it.\n\nFast forward to this school year, and it seems like Sam is spending even more time hanging out with Stacey. He recently received the results back from a physics quiz and his score was disappointing, significantly lower than his normal average. It wasn't only this quiz. He got back and English assignment that was also lower than his normal and found a chemistry assignment to be more difficult than normal.\n\nWe spoke with him about it, he explained that he was still rusty from the summer and would perform much better on the next quiz and assignments. Ryan and I weren't satisfied with this response and I told him that he should have studied more the night before the physics quiz instead of having dinner with Stacey's parents. My husband was working late that night and didn't know this, and he became pretty angry when he found out. He told Sam that he could not have Stacey over again and that he himself could not go to her house on school nights.\n\nSam became upset with this and later asked me to talk with Ryan. I told him that the decision was final and that Stacey not studying herself for the quiz must have rubbed off on him. He told me that she wasn't in the physics class, and I told him that this made things even worse since she didn't care that he had a quiz the next day. I then told him that the ban will stay in effect for the foreseeable future.\n\nI was talking with my younger sister (Amanda F36), who always had a soft spot for Sam. She says that we're being unbelievably harsh and that we should not focus so much on Sam's grades.\n\nAITA?\n\nContext - For those wondering his normal physics scores are typically in the high 80s to low 90s range. His quiz score was a 62", "created_utc": 1694093708, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cg1an/aita_for_upholding_my_husbands_ban_on_our_sons/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You dont do that by forbidding him, cause he'll do it anyway and things will get worse.

What are you gonna do next year when he goes off to college? Well assuming he\u2019s still talking with you.  Let the kid live his life. Is he failing all his classes? Is he doing drugs? Causing trouble or committing crimes?  If he isn\u2019t then don\u2019t worry and let him be 17.", "Yta. Your son told you the material is more difficult but you're still blaming his time with his friend. You're punishing him by taking away a basic need (human connection) for a harmful expectation (perfection) instead of helping. Find out why he's having trouble instead of just assuming and actually help him by addressing the problem he's having with the material and the problem you're having with perfectionism.", "YTA big time. It\u2019s a high school fling. Chill the F out. This sub has been full of parents not wanting their children to be happy this morning", "YTA\n\nControlling your son like this will not lead to the result you're looking for.", "YTA. This will only make things worse.  A better solution would be to tell your son that weeknights are for studying, so no guests, but that he is welcome to go see Stacey or she can come over every Saturday.", "YTA.  I had a friend like that in high school, and my grades probably suffered.  49 now.  Still friends with some of those folks, and no one has asked about my grades in over 30 years.", "YTA. \n\nYour son is having trouble balancing his schoolwork, his (obvious) romantic relationship, and his extracurricular activities. Making him feel like he\u2019s doing something wrong by having a relationship won\u2019t help him in the long run. It may not even help his grades because he may be too upset about being banned from his girlfriend to concentrate on studies. \n\nIf you want him to be able to balance the obligations of his life as an adult, you need to help him to do it now. It\u2019s normal to be in a romantic relationship at 17. It\u2019s normal to want to have a personal life outside of school. Those things will create conflict as your kid tries to manage them all. It\u2019s your job as the adult to model how to balance all of that and to help them learn how to do it themselves. \n\nYou\u2019re just going to teach your son to only be able to go all-or-nothing on one thing at a time while neglecting important parts of himself.", "LOL so many YTA . ... I didn't see anything that said he's not allowed to see her at all? Pretty sure weekends were okay.\n\nThere's a reason why you're not considered an adult until your 18 and even then.... we think we're so smart at 18 and we realize we're not. \n\nYou're looking out for his future. If his grades and school work weren't slipping I bet you and your husband wouldn't really being saying much about how much time he spends with her", "YTA\n\nSocial emotional learning and growth is every bit as important as academic learning and growth. This is a hard pill to swallow for some, but the reality is he is developing, growing, and learning from his relationships with peers just as much, if not more than from his academic classes. It\u2019s important for your son to find balance in his life that includes academics/work and relationships. It isn\u2019t healthy or useful for him to develop the idea that it has to be one or the other. \n\nIt is also dangerous to teach your son that the solution to life dilemmas is to institute bans on people we care about. It may be a good idea to talk to your son and Stacy together in a calm atmosphere ( maybe have Stacy over for dinner) and lay out you and your husband\u2019s expectations for study time and grade maintenance for your son. This will help to remove hurt feelings and confusion about whether or not Stacy is resented or unwelcome in your home and family life ( hopefully she is not disliked and unwelcome since clearly your son is fond of her and wants her around). \n\nUltimately your son will grow and develop into a successful, happy, healthy person who has to make his own decisions and way in life and you can help him by trusting him and showing your confidence in him is this situation. Don\u2019t make the mistake of over correcting or over reacting to this situation.", "When you are trying figure out why he doesn't want to spend any time with you think back to this, YTA", "YTA. 17 yr old kids are being 17. But keep punishing your son for growing up. It has always worked out well /s.", "Soft YTA- it's developmentally appropriate for your teenage kid to be more interested in a relationship than his grades. However if he is stating that it is more about the material and get him a tutor. I said in a different comment that there's likely some kind of community resource or even just a college student in the area who can give some help. Talk to his school and ask about it. If the only solution is he can't see his girlfriend, that's kind of shitty. Help guide him on how to balance his responsibilities this is an important skill.", "Completely agree during the week and give him freedom on the weekends. You might be careful because they can still talk on the computer and phone. Get him a tutor if his grades continue to be bad.\n\nYes grades are important for the next phase; college or trade school. You need to sit down and explain it\u2019s fine to have girlfriends but when it comes to school he needs to do better. He needs to understand the balance because after HS the girls will want his time. He needs to learn boundaries because in college it cost money.", "If you think he's making a mistake I think it might be time to let him figure it out for himself.  I agree with your son that you're essentially punishing her and with your sister that you're being a touch harsh. YTA", "YTA, he's only going to get to be young once. Never again. While a job, university and tests will be there next year, the year after, the year after that, for the next 100 years. Grades and degrees can be a decade in the making 30-40. \n\nSounds like you want the best for him, but youre struggling to realise he's a man of his own making. Leave him alone and let him find his own path, we all walk it differently.\n\n\nLet's put it this way... He's basically an adult. Would you tell a 56 year old woman who spends her time going to water parks for fun that 'you need to go to bed and rest, or cram for work tomorrow to impress the boss...\" lol no... Why are you doing that to your son?", "YTA. Ever consider that maybe Sam is burned out from school and worrying about grades? I know I was at that age. Because just like you, all my parents cared about were grades, grades, grades. To the point where I became a little robot until my new boyfriend broke me out of that and taught me how to actually live a life. Who, btw, is still my SO more than 20 years later.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's totally gonna elope with this girl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKidding aside, though, if he is struggling in school, rather than a blanket ban on his girlfriend, get him some support. Maybe you need to structure the day and be stricter, and make him study during certain hours. Maybe you should HELP him study. Maybe he has burnout. Maybe he has too many classes or extra curriculers. Give him help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs Stacy in any of his classes? Invite her over to study. In the living room where you can make sure they are actually studying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYeah, I can see wanting to be stricter because he's not doing well. That's valid. But banning his friend is a weird solution.", "[removed]", "NTA his grades have slipped so hard they're almost failing. I get that he wants to spend every moment with his first gf, but school is important and summer school would disrupt his romantic plans even more.", "NTA. I will say though, it seems this thread isn\u2019t fond of parenting when it comes to consequences - especially for teens. Maybe try a thread that\u2019s dedicated to parenting and you might actually get some more reasonable replies.", "Kindly, YTA. Didn\u2019t school just start? I feel like he can easily save his grades so early in the semester/marking period. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re American or where you are, but some teachers/schools give students the opportunity for test retakes, extra credit, and depending on how many points the grade is worth, it can sometimes only make the smallest dent. \n\nIf he\u2019s heading to college soon, this school year is the year that shit gets real and intense and stressful. Kids do forget things over the summer, I even do and I work in a school! I think before punishing your son and blaming his girlfriend (which comes off a little icky and misogynistic tbh) you need to ask yourself what you can do for him to achieve his academic goals. Does he have a nice organized space to do work? Even if he already has one, revamping it and creating a cozy environment can help. Does he have a schedule outside of school? Plan his afternoons out where he\u2019s studying for a certain amount of time and then after he can be social with people (ex- if he gets home from school at 2:30, have homework and study time either be 3-5 or a before bed kinda thing like 7-9). Work with him, let him have a say but stay firm that grades are important. Perfection isn\u2019t always necessary. \n\nI think some people are getting the vibe that you expect straight A\u2019s and no mistakes. I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt that you aren\u2019t like that. But point is, he\u2019s 17. He\u2019s human and he\u2019s probably in love. \n\nI was punished in high school by being cut off from my friends/outside world outside of school. It still affects me terribly. Whatever you do just Don\u2019t do that  please", "This is called authoritative parenting. It's ineffective.\n\nThis is all a kid really needs: I believe in you; I trust you; I know you can handle life situations; You are listened to; You are cared for; You are very important to me.\n\nTalk to your kid about why his grades are slipping. Suggest a mental health professional or a doctor's visit. Talk with him about healthy relationships versus unhealthy relationships. Talk and then let him decide and support him. That's the secret sauce. Good luck.", "YTA - let the kid have fun, they aren't your grades they're his, you sound like a really demanding set of parents and you're going to push him away.", "YTA- so when will your 17 year old sin be allowed to manage his time and relationships without being punished?", "YTA. He's 17, not 7. Keep pushing him and you're not going to have a relationship much longer. If my dad tried to stop me from dating at that age I would have laughed in his face. Your son has more patience than I have. Back off while you still can.", "YTA. Your kid is 17, you can't ban him from seeing certain people - he'll just do it and not tell you and then you'll have even less visibility into why he's struggling at school.\n\nFrom years of failure analysis and management experience, focus on the problem - his grades are slipping. Work with him and his teachers as a team to find a solution that everyone agrees to. Again, he is almost an adult.

He's a smart and ambitious kid, and I'm certain he'll succeed in his studies, but his recent behavior has made me (F46) and his father (Ryan M46) worried. This worry stems from his close friendship with his classmate Stacey (F17).\r\n\nInitially, their relationship seemed like a regular friendship when it began back in February. However, Ryan and I did notice how he spent way more time with Stacey compared to his other friends, and she would come over to our house pretty often. We weren't exactly thrilled about Sam spending so much time with Stacey, and we made it very clear to him that his school obligations should not suffer as a result of the time he spends with her. He has always assured us that it wouldn't.\r\n\nThat being said, Sam's marks began to slide and when we told him about our concerns, he said that it wasn't Stacey's fault and that he was tired from his extracurriculars or that the material covered had become more challenging.\r\n\nDuring the summer, it became increasingly apparent that Sam's time and attention were disproportionately consumed by Stacey. Ryan told him that during the upcoming school year, he would need to focus primarily on his school work and that he should not waste time entertaining Stacey. He was upset with this and said that he could manage his time properly and that we shouldn't worry about it.\r\n\nFast forward to this school year, and it seems like Sam is spending even more time hanging out with Stacey. He recently received the results back from a physics quiz and his score was disappointing, significantly lower than his normal average. It wasn't only this quiz. He got back and English assignment that was also lower than his normal and found a chemistry assignment to be more difficult than normal.\r\n\nWe spoke with him about it, he explained that he was still rusty from the summer and would perform much better on the next quiz and assignments. Ryan and I weren't satisfied with this response and I told him that he should have studied more the night before the physics quiz instead of having dinner with Stacey's parents. My husband was working late that night and didn't know this, and he became pretty angry when he found out. He told Sam that he could not have Stacey over again and that he himself could not go to her house on school nights.\r\n\nSam became upset with this and later asked me to talk with Ryan. I told him that the decision was final and that Stacey not studying herself for the quiz must have rubbed off on him. He told me that she wasn't in the physics class, and I told him that this made things even worse since she didn't care that he had a quiz the next day.

And just because you keep them physically apart doesn\u2019t mean they will focus on schoolwork. \n\nI say all of this as someone who had many extracurricular activities, advanced courses, and friends, but did not really date in high school. You should set boundaries, but not try to cut him off. Try to become more involved. You cannot force your kid to be a good student. Is he feeling overwhelmed? He is going to be working the rest of his life, why can\u2019t he enjoy high school?\n\nI preferred to hang out with family, but still didn\u2019t enjoy schoolwork. I would finish it all while at school (what I bothered to complete). Kids especially in advanced courses are loaded down with a lot of unnecessary homework. It is different from when OP went to school. It is different from when I went to school. We have a 5 year old student who is sent home with homework.

Putting all this pressure on your child can have horrible consequences.. My parents would yell at me for bad grades. They would yell at me so much when I would go to my room crying I would contemplate ending it.

I have never thought about that since getting out of their disappointment and out of teenage emotions, but I\u2019m just saying, if you think you are being harsh at all they could be thinking you would be better off without them. It isn\u2019t right or true, but I would rather my kid fail than to think for even a second I didn\u2019t love them more than anything and that their best is enough for me. \n\nThis may be his best for now.

Sam knows himself he is slipping - he's not daft.  And OP's right to be concerned too - this is pre-college time when scores & studying matter.  So why not involve Sam in the solution?  Ask him why he finds things more challenging - is it time / the subject matter?  What can you do to help if it's the subject matter?  Would a tutor be a possibility?  If it's time, how would Sam suggest making more time?  Perhaps cutting Stacy nights down to 2 during the week, or agreeing no Stacy-night before a test.  How long should the new arrangements go on for?  A time period. or until results go back up?  \n\nMaking Sam an ally in getting the work / friend balance right for him & his plans is going to be better than stomping your opinions & solutions all over him.", "YTA, you can't control your kids behavior like this and expect it to work.

If they had a low test grade, then we sat down with them to review and see what needed to be addressed.  And if their overall grade dropped below an 85 then we would sit down nightly and review together to determine what would be the correct course of action.  IE extra time for homework, tutoring, etc.\n\nIn this situation I would probably implement a study curfew where the kid would meet with myself or their dad at a specific time each evening to review and go over their studies, until those grades are back above 85.\n\nWe also invest in online subscriptions for their harder classes, so they have access to additional resources.", "YTA.
