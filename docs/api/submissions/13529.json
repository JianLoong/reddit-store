EDIT:  \nhe also agreed to me not transferring till the day of!! \n\nhe was already acting a little distant and cold when i came back from college to see him, but i assumed we were going to go together because i didn\u2019t see the break up coming that soon. flash forward to mid january, he is being hella distant and acting mean and strange to me for no reason. i was going to talk to him in person since we are long distance the first week of february to get to the bottom of why he was treating me like this. the day i was going to see him, i get a text from his previous ex that he was flirting and trying to hook up with her, telling that he wishes i broke up with him, and that he was only staying with me so he could go to the concert and then end things after. she said she doesnt want anything to do with him because she is done and over him and she has a new bf. he also said he wanted to go fuck a bunch of girls and wouldnt care cause it will happen. \n\ni obviously broke up with him because of what he was saying and he also was texting other girls some out of bounds shit. he blocked me on everything after i called him out and we been in no contact for a month and a half. i invite my best friend the week after the break up to come with me instead, because i had the other ticket still and assumed that he didn\u2019t want to even go because he blocked me on everything and didn\u2019t try to negotiate going. \n\ntoday, my ex texts me out of the blue saying \u201cuh, can i have my city morgue ticket\u201d. mind you the concert is this saturday. i didnt respond because i want nothing to do with him for treating me this way. plus, i would be the one driving him because he doesnt have a car. what should i do? am i wrong for this?\n\nfor clarification, my ex broke his side of no contact and asked for his ticket.\ni also do feel bad cause last august, when our relationship was good, he bought my suicideboys ticket which i begged him not to so the city morgue tickets was kind of my \u201cpay you back\u201d deal.\n\nupdate: he texted one of my friends about it. she said he isn\u2019t going because he decided to be a cheater, and he is sad about it. and he texted me again saying \u201cit was my christmas present wasnt it?\u201d lord some things i regret doing.", "created_utc": 1680117270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/125xrv3/aita_taking_my_friend_to_a_concert_with_tixkets_i/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is no longer your boyfriend. Unless he had paid you for the ticket i'd say YTA. Then to message you before the concert? Absolutely not.", "NTA\n\nYour ex wanted to cheat on you\n\nYou owe him nothing.\n\nBring your friend to the concert, your ex can eat dirt.", "NTA - tell him to buy his own ticket.", "NTA. I\u2019d just ignore his message. Blocking him would be even better because he sounds like the type that will try to ruin the night of the concert for you by blowing your phone up.  \n\nHis own dishonest actions are the reason he doesn\u2019t get to go, it\u2019s his fault, not yours. You misbehave? You get coal, not concert tickets.", "NTA. Take photos at the concert and flip him off.", "NTA.\n\n\"What ticket?  You don't have a ticket.  I have two tickets and I am still planning on taking my boyfriend in December.\"\n\nHell, if he couldn't get the day off work, you weren't going to take him anyway. You always held it back, just in case.  Hence, it was never his ticket.", "NTA. It sounds like he didn't break up with you because he wanted the ticket, which you never actually gave him and the audacity he thinks it's still his.", "NTA", "NTA - While you did buy the ticket for both of you he did have some right to his ticket... DID - under the circumstances of when you bought them. Then he planned to selfishly cheat you out of those circumstances, which is what makes you NTA imo!", "NTA you owe him nothing. He is just upset that his plan didn\u2019t work. His ex told you exactly what he was planning. Block him. Go enjoy your concert!", "Real piece of work that guy.. NTA", "Do not regret anything when dealing with an ex. Take those tickets and enjoy that concert with your bestie. He is not worth it at all. NTA", "NTA. Stop being silly, girl. You owe him nothing. You paid for the tickets, you keep them both. Gift revoked. Is his problem to deal with, not yours.", "Only the TA to yourself if you don't block him. Enjoy the concert.", "Yeah no, NTA. he doesn't deserve them", "NTA", "NTA \nHoney, tell that fool boy \"cry me a river and go soak your head!\" then block his cheating ass.", "LOL nta blockkkkk", "nta\n\nyou don\u2019t get the benefits without even being a friend. it would be one thing if you had already transferred the ticket and somehow clawed it back.", "Ignore him. It'd be shitty to go like reclaim a ticket from him but your name your ticket. NTA", "> \u201c\u2026he is sad about it. and he texted me again saying \u201cit was my christmas present wasnt it?\u201d \u201c\n\nNo, it was a Christmas present for your boyfriend. \n\nIs he sad is he? D\u2019aww. Where\u2019s my tiny violin?\n\nNTA.", "NTA; about the suicideboy ticket, you didn't asked for it, he gave it to you even if you think you owe him. I think it's fair for you to not to give the ticket as a \"pay you back\" favor because well, your \"debt\" was nonexistent already when he cheated on you \ud83d\udc80", "NTA\n\nBut geez is your Shift key broken?", "everyone saying NTA. but even though he did bad stuff it was his Christmas present. he definitely got stuff for her during Christmas so morally isn\u2019t it still his ticket?", "[deleted]", "NTA. You go to that concert with your friend and enjoy it. He\u2019s an entitled cheater. Also good on his other ex for letting you know. She\u2019s a real one. He lost two good women sucks to be him.", "NTA he doesn't deserve the ticket", "NTA. I\u2019m excited to go see City Morgue in Denver next month, I would have loved to treat you after reading this! Also good to see someone else enjoyed the $b concert last August!\n\nNow, as for paying back the ticket, he fucked hp when he cheated and said he was only staying for the concert. He deserves no payback for something he bought out of good will (I\u2019m assuming). Enjoy your concert with your girlie!", "Don\u2019t you DARE give him that ticket or even the time of day. Go and have fun with your friend.\n\nSoooo NTA.", "NTA. He literally admitted to using you for the concert. Why would you even consider rewarding that kind of disgusting behavior? \n\nTake your bestie and enjoy the concert guilt free. He doesn\u2019t get to live in your head rent free any more!", "NTA. Don't give him that ticket.", "This is the way", "As much as this seems like the right way, he'll take it as you are willing to engage in communication or negotiation. It will probably spiral into not at all useful conversation. The best way is to say that to yourself and continue to not respond to his messages. Any response will only make things worse. \n\nI like to just write these kinds of responses out on a piece of paper and burn them. I get my final say on my own world and they get to be denied the dignity of any response since they don't deserve one anyway.", "yes, i broke up with him because of the shitty things and cheating he was doing behind my back. and it all escalated very quickly where he didn\u2019t give a fuck about our relationship and decided to do these things. but he never bothered to negotiate the concert details while we were broken up since february so i assumed he wasn\u2019t interested in going until today.", "no i\u2019m typing from my phone, i\u2019m sorry", "well he only got me a palm tree and his mom gave me bath and bodyworks stuff", "Legally it is not since the gift was not completed, and the ticket was never in his name or possession.", "They were a Christmas present for her boyfriend. It just so happens that she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend to share them with anymore.", "This is the correct way to handle this....", "To me there was mo negotiation to be had as part of the breakup due to his sketchiness and you hadn't given him the ticket.\n\nHe can be as interested as he wants. I hope you and your friend have a great time!", "oh. then fuck the dude. enjoy the concert", "last i checked this was AITA and not legal laws or wtv"]}
