She mentioned it in passing to me and I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nFast forward to Wednesday when I wake up and my wife is a little panicky and asking if we can buy a taser locally. I ask what going on and she tells me she has been communicating with that old friend and that he got bizarre on her - telling her they were meant to be together and that her deceased sister is talking to him. Sounds pretty weird, so I ask if I can read his messages.\n\n\u201cNo! I deleted them because they were silly.\u201d\n\nOk, not was I was expecting. We go to the store and get her some pepper spray and she even buys a bottle for home. Later that night, she tells me that she got him to go away by telling him that she was pregnant. He said he would give her space - again weird. \n\nNow I am reliving the day and rushing to get protection from weirdos and wondering why she would be so satisfied when she was scared earlier. She had told me his name earlier, but I have memory issues from some brain damage and I forgot. I asked for it again so at least I had it in case something happened. She refused. She tells me that she doesn\u2019t want me to embarrass him any more than he already is. I swear I won\u2019t even contact him but feel like it would be safer to know in case something did happen. She refuses. We go back and forth but she won\u2019t do it.\n\nSo here we are a few days later and she still refuses to tell me. She\u2019s mad at me for saying I was having trust issues over this and that it felt like she was hiding something. We\u2019ve been married for eight years. I know if I were in her shoes, I would be telling everyone I know about what is happening. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s told anyone but me.

Please don\u2019t take the advice to immediately conclude that your wife is cheating, that\u2019s so stupid. \n\n1. Why would your wife want a taser to protect herself against an affair partner? To throw you off the trail of an affair you didn\u2019t even suspect her of having at that point? Most convoluted cover up ever. \n\n2. It actually does make sense for her to delete harassing messages. I\u2019ve had it happen to me when someone I blocked kept messaging me from new numbers, I just repeatedly deleted and blocked. Sometimes saving messages for evidence is best practice. Sometimes you know law enforcement isn\u2019t going to do shit about repeated \u201chey gorgeous, why won\u2019t you talk to me\u201d messages, so you delete them for your own peace of mind. \n\n3. Your say you\u2019re not violent, and I take you at you word. But you\u2019ve suffered a brain injury and memory loss, so I wonder if your wife is concerned in any way about your reaction if she told you the name of the person she feels threatened by. \n\nTalk to her, but keep in mind that your are not in her shoes and don\u2019t get to dictate how you think she should be handling this traumatizing experience. Listen, respect how she wants to be supported.", "NAH. You aren't wrong for being concerned, but deleting the messages could have been more about getting them out of her head than preventing you from seeing them.\n\nAs a woman who's been stalked, I think I'm looking at this from a different perspective than the folks who are rushing to tell you she must have cheated. My creeper was scary. It was something I needed to work through on my own though, and having the men in my life go all overprotective did not help. When it started, I went to my friends for advice. They all swore to me they wouldn't contact the stalker. Two of the guys fucking did it anyway, which set off new bursts of creeper activity. He didn't really respond to them at all; I was the one who paid the price.\n\nWhen I look back at that time, one of the things that frustrates me is that my guy friends, despite their good intentions, because one more source of stress I had to manage. So many girls are raised with fathers, brothers, or friends who brag about making sure other men treat us right. Who jokingly threaten our dates. Who clean their guns when we get picked up by a new guy. When I ran into a problem, I felt like I had to hide the full extent of it because all that macho bullshit made me fear that someone I cared about would end up in jail. I had to worry about my safety and work through my feelings about living in fear, and then on top of that I had to manage the emotional responses of every man in my social circle who heard even a fraction of what was going on.\n\nI deleted my creep messages because I didn't want them in my head. That wasn't necessarily the smartest idea; it's usually recommended that you document all attempts to make contact. But I can't say I wouldn't react that way again if I thought there was any chance some stalker's intrusion might cause bigger problems for my friends or family.\n\nYou may never have given your wife any reason to think that you're a hothead who'd go against her wishes, but it does sound a little like you're making her scary situation about you and your feelings.", "NTA, but this sounds very odd. I'm not going to jump to 'she's cheating with him,' because it could be a variety of things, but I'd sit her down when you're both calm and ask her to tell you what happened. If she's threatened to the point she needs a bottle of pepper spray for the home you share, you're certainly entitled to know exactly what the threat is. \n\nI think the odds are very, very low, but there is a chance he threatened her with something from her past, or made a direct threat to you if she says more. Again, I think the chances of this are very small, but I wouldn't go into the conversation with her convinced she's cheating/hiding something she did from you", "Nta\n\nThis is really bad. Either she's lying to you or there's a guy who is dangerously obsessed with her free in the wind. And she deleted all the evidence. How are you supposed to be safe? \n\nThis is not how people who are in danger normally behave.", "It sounds fishy that she deleted the messages. She IS hiding something.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s also concerned for her safety to the point where she wants to arm herself but won\u2019t tell you\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re also in danger?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let this go, you need more information.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but I suspect she's not being honest with you about the contents of their messages, and why he was hung up on her in the first place.  Suggest you visit a lawyer and a private investigator.", "NTA. Absolutely everything about this is weird and suspicious.", "NTA. She is deliberately withholding important information about someone who is not only putting her in danger, but potentially you as well. Sounds like she maybe went too far in her messaging and she is trying to cover the situation up.", "NTA\n\nYour wife's behaviour is suspicious / curious, but it may just be that she wants to put it behind her and not relive the embarrassment and trauma.\n\nIt may be innocent but you are allowed to feel concerned. Feeling like you can't trust her because she isnt sharing the name is warranted, but it doesn't mean there is actually something to worry about.", "I am not sure there is enough info here. She may be not telling you because of something dishonest on her side, or she may not be telling you because she fears you will have some massive overreaction and do something stupid to the guy. We don't know the tone in which you ask, nor how she is actually answering.", "I believe she cheated with guy and started acted panicking out of guilt and fear that you will find out so she made up this story about the teaser and pepper spray to gaslit you and deleted the messages to erase evidence and acted mad because she was afraid she was gonna get caught. Anyway she is a piece of work", "NTA and something is very off. \n\n1. She deleted the texts. The only reason to delete texts is so you don\u2019t see them. This means that something may have happened between them. \n\n2. She\u2019s says she\u2019s mad that you are distrusting and that\u2019s why she isn\u2019t giving you his name. The only reason to be angry at this is because there IS something to be distrusting about and if you know his name, you can find him, talk to him, and then he might tell you what happened between the two of them. \n\n3. Tell her to come clean or you\u2019d like to have her phone and take it to a place that can retrieve the deleted messages (this probably isn\u2019t a real thing, but it might jolt her into coming clean). If this doesn\u2019t work, you may want to tell her you want to separate for awhile and see what she says. In the very least, you guys need couples counseling.", "NTA . She's cheating.", "Cheating. NTA.", "NTA. She isn't being fully open and seems to be hiding something big. Sounds like maybe she entertained an affair but he turned out to be a weirdo and she got cold feet. The fact she won't tell you his name tells m she doesn't want you talking to him ever, at all. Dump her ass.", "NTA\n\nShe's putting her family at risk for not telling you.", "NTA.  Your wife is not being honest with you .", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but your wife is doing something fishy  buddy because it makes no sense for her to be that scared then delete messages that could help her down the line if he decided to come back around makes no sense in my opinion then she won\u2019t tell you his name ?

My opinion:  she's going back and forth on if she wants to sleep with this guy.", "NTA. At this point it concerns your family aswell so she needs to be honest about the situation.", "Actually, it\u2019s very normal for women to delete messages because they don\u2019t want to deal with the unpleasantness. In fact when women are being harassed or abused, women centers find that the women who are being abused have deleted all traces of it because also often they might feel like it\u2019s their fault (think a husband who\u2019s hitting his wife and the wife wants to keep up the illusion that the husband is a good guy). So the advice they give the women is to start creating a trail of evidence. \n\nSo that part isn\u2019t so unbelievable. Maybe the woman is just genuinely freaked out. I think the husband needs to calmly sit down and explain to her that he\u2019s worried about her and it\u2019s for her safety he wants the info. And that he won\u2019t act upon it unless she asks him to. Those reassurances said in a calm and adult manner should work. But here it sounds like the situation keeps escalating and they\u2019re bickering.", "It definitely doesn\u2019t make sense to delete harassing messages if they are bad enough someone is thinking about needing a taser. That never makes sense. And that\u2019s why it seems so suspicious to so many people.", "You make several good points including pointing out my brain injury. It did definitely change my personality some and makes things a lot harder - stress, temper, etc.  She does say that if something did happen, the cops could get those messages recovered. I did blow off the deleting messages until she refused to tell me his name. That was two red flags that I really did not want to see. I\u2019m just confused and lost really.", ">You may never have given your wife any reason to think that you're a hothead who'd go against her wishes, but it does sound a little like you're making her scary situation about you and your feelings.\n\nThey have children. They may be in danger if what she says is true. He's not making it about himself, he's concerned for the safety of his family. You trying to frame it as if he's the bad guy is very strange.", "Honestly, I think he has reasonable suspicion of cheating at this point.", "It does seem off.", "And we have children too.", "That\u2019s the killer. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m worried about coming home and finding someone went all Glenn Close on one of our rabbits. I know she said he ranted about her dead sister saying they were meant to be together. I\u2019m no psychologist, but concern seems warranted from that.", "I\u2019m not violent. I felt that this was threatening to her, myself and my kids which is why I wanted a name.", "Sounds pretty plausible.", "Yeah my sister was like this with her first abusive ex. She had no clue how to handle insane behavior and just wished it all away. If the wife doesn't even think this guy is relevant, just acting insane and targeting her, I could see why she would just wish it would all go away and ignore it. It can be a coping mechanism.", "But this isn\u2019t an abusive bf or ex this is an old friend he never said she was or had been abused or that they dated it sound like she is cheating no woman that\u2019s possibly being stalked in that way is deleting messages with the proof she would have no reason to save his image or not tell her husband his name then to make him seem like he\u2019s the delusional one only proves more she\u2019s guilty of some", "The taser is for peace of mind. I carry a taser, knife, and mace and I have a gun at home (20+ yrs of experience and combat vet husband) while I don't feel I need them because I have been stalked I feel safer. I deleted the messages, but I've always told him if they've contacted me.", "He didn't mention a fear for the children in the OP. He said he's having \"trust issues\" now and is comparing her reaction to how he would handle a similar problem.\n\nI clearly said NAH.", "This whole thing gives off cheating vibes. Sounds like she ended it maybe and he\u2019s not particularly happy about it.", "How would you react (re. messages) if a random woman started messaging you, escalated to the point of saying you belong together out of nowhere, and then invoking your deceased family members? You would show your partner the messages to 1. Show your partner how innocent you were, and 2. Share the full, scary situation with your partner so that she\u2019s fully informed about what this person is capable of and can keep safe. You wouldnt delete proof that this person is saying deranged shit to you without reason, shit that could be helpful if you needed a restraining order. \n\nYour partner is up to something, and the most apparent answer to me is that she was somehow encouraging/participating in the romance until it got too intense for her, deleted evidence that makes her look culpable, and made up a story to rule you up on full alert so that you jump into \u201cprotect the family\u201d mode and don\u2019t question her", "It\u2019s very off. She\u2019s hiding something.", "Yeah, that makes it that much more important.", "That could be true. It sounds weird to say but I hope so because I really don\u2019t like the alternative.", "No, I  hid all evidence of my abusive ex from family and friends. A coworker saw bruises and contacted them. I also didn't keep everyone informed (including boyfriends) that he continued to harass me for 10 years. I couldn't get an RO because he was \"out of state.\" I was at a bar with my husband a few months ago and saw a different ex who had tried to get in touch after I blocked him by sending money via venmo and PayPal ($5) and I just told him we needed to leave but didn't say why until we had left. She might be worried that hubs will do something rash, and dude isn't worth it.", "Oh yeah, plenty of women react by deleting the messages. When you feel like something is happening that is out of your control it's a form of denial, especially if you feel like people might blame you or not believe that you didn't invite it in some way. It's a 'make this not be happening' response.", "I definitely am worried about everyone, including my wife. You have some very valid points but I am unaware of any past trauma that might have caused her reaction. I admit to being very hurt by the fact that she says can\u2019t trust me to tell me his name because I have never done anything to warrant that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Especially since there may be a danger. I don\u2019t know. She says she unfriended him and wants to drop it.", "this is an absolutely deranged take and so victim blaming. you are assuming this woman is \u201csearching for it\u201d because she is not behaving like the perfect victim"]}
