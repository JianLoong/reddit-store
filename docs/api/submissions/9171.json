She mentioned it in passing to me and I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nFast forward to Wednesday when I wake up and my wife is a little panicky and asking if we can buy a taser locally. I ask what going on and she tells me she has been communicating with that old friend and that he got bizarre on her - telling her they were meant to be together and that her deceased sister is talking to him. Sounds pretty weird, so I ask if I can read his messages.\n\n\u201cNo! I deleted them because they were silly.\u201d\n\nOk, not was I was expecting. We go to the store and get her some pepper spray and she even buys a bottle for home. Later that night, she tells me that she got him to go away by telling him that she was pregnant. He said he would give her space - again weird. \n\nNow I am reliving the day and rushing to get protection from weirdos and wondering why she would be so satisfied when she was scared earlier. She had told me his name earlier, but I have memory issues from some brain damage and I forgot. I asked for it again so at least I had it in case something happened. She refused. She tells me that she doesn\u2019t want me to embarrass him any more than he already is. I swear I won\u2019t even contact him but feel like it would be safer to know in case something did happen. She refuses. We go back and forth but she won\u2019t do it.\n\nSo here we are a few days later and she still refuses to tell me. She\u2019s mad at me for saying I was having trust issues over this and that it felt like she was hiding something. We\u2019ve been married for eight years. I know if I were in her shoes, I would be telling everyone I know about what is happening. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s told anyone but me. Am I being paranoid?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your responses. It is a weird situation and I am not sure what I should do. The comments from women that have been stalked is incredibly compelling to me. It actually helps explain a lot. I do want to add a couple of notes to clarify some things. I should have given more clarity to the wackiness of the messages she told me she received. Aside from believing they were destined to be together, he told my wife that her dead sister (she died at five days old) was also talking to him and telling him it was meant to be. About my TBI, it is actually an ABI as I had a brain aneurysm burst five years ago. I wouldn\u2019t be alive today if not for my wife who performed CPR on me and saved my life. My temper was impacted so it is much shorter than it use to be. Basically it made me much more grumpy. I have thrown things (never at people) but maybe once or twice a year. I wouldn\u2019t be violent at all with this guy unless he was in front of us directly threatening my family. I have no desire to hunt him down and talk to him at all.  The aneurysm also put me on disability before my 50s and slashed our income to a quarter of what it once was. Needless to say, it has added a ton of stress to our lives. We have two adult children and five at home. The pregnancy excuse wasn\u2019t odd to me for that reason. She wants to get pregnant again. Finally it was being petty mentioning how long she was at the store, but yes this is pretty normal for her. It can be irritating when you have five kids at home when you have chronic headaches and the mom takes her time at the store.", "created_utc": 1675577999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10u5pre/aita_for_wanting_to_know_more_about_a_man_the/", "score": 840, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please don\u2019t take the advice to immediately conclude that your wife is cheating, that\u2019s so stupid. \n\n1. Why would your wife want a taser to protect herself against an affair partner? To throw you off the trail of an affair you didn\u2019t even suspect her of having at that point? Most convoluted cover up ever. \n\n2. It actually does make sense for her to delete harassing messages. I\u2019ve had it happen to me when someone I blocked kept messaging me from new numbers, I just repeatedly deleted and blocked. Sometimes saving messages for evidence is best practice. Sometimes you know law enforcement isn\u2019t going to do shit about repeated \u201chey gorgeous, why won\u2019t you talk to me\u201d messages, so you delete them for your own peace of mind. \n\n3. Your say you\u2019re not violent, and I take you at you word. But you\u2019ve suffered a brain injury and memory loss, so I wonder if your wife is concerned in any way about your reaction if she told you the name of the person she feels threatened by. \n\nTalk to her, but keep in mind that your are not in her shoes and don\u2019t get to dictate how you think she should be handling this traumatizing experience. Listen, respect how she wants to be supported.", "NAH. You aren't wrong for being concerned, but deleting the messages could have been more about getting them out of her head than preventing you from seeing them.\n\nAs a woman who's been stalked, I think I'm looking at this from a different perspective than the folks who are rushing to tell you she must have cheated. My creeper was scary. It was something I needed to work through on my own though, and having the men in my life go all overprotective did not help. When it started, I went to my friends for advice. They all swore to me they wouldn't contact the stalker. Two of the guys fucking did it anyway, which set off new bursts of creeper activity. He didn't really respond to them at all; I was the one who paid the price.\n\nWhen I look back at that time, one of the things that frustrates me is that my guy friends, despite their good intentions, because one more source of stress I had to manage. So many girls are raised with fathers, brothers, or friends who brag about making sure other men treat us right. Who jokingly threaten our dates. Who clean their guns when we get picked up by a new guy. When I ran into a problem, I felt like I had to hide the full extent of it because all that macho bullshit made me fear that someone I cared about would end up in jail. I had to worry about my safety and work through my feelings about living in fear, and then on top of that I had to manage the emotional responses of every man in my social circle who heard even a fraction of what was going on.\n\nI deleted my creep messages because I didn't want them in my head. That wasn't necessarily the smartest idea; it's usually recommended that you document all attempts to make contact. But I can't say I wouldn't react that way again if I thought there was any chance some stalker's intrusion might cause bigger problems for my friends or family.\n\nYou may never have given your wife any reason to think that you're a hothead who'd go against her wishes, but it does sound a little like you're making her scary situation about you and your feelings.", "NTA, but this sounds very odd. I'm not going to jump to 'she's cheating with him,' because it could be a variety of things, but I'd sit her down when you're both calm and ask her to tell you what happened. If she's threatened to the point she needs a bottle of pepper spray for the home you share, you're certainly entitled to know exactly what the threat is. \n\nI think the odds are very, very low, but there is a chance he threatened her with something from her past, or made a direct threat to you if she says more. Again, I think the chances of this are very small, but I wouldn't go into the conversation with her convinced she's cheating/hiding something she did from you", "Nta\n\nThis is really bad. Either she's lying to you or there's a guy who is dangerously obsessed with her free in the wind. And she deleted all the evidence. How are you supposed to be safe? \n\nThis is not how people who are in danger normally behave.", "It sounds fishy that she deleted the messages. She IS hiding something.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s also concerned for her safety to the point where she wants to arm herself but won\u2019t tell you\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re also in danger?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let this go, you need more information.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but I suspect she's not being honest with you about the contents of their messages, and why he was hung up on her in the first place.  Suggest you visit a lawyer and a private investigator.", "NTA. Absolutely everything about this is weird and suspicious.", "NTA.

Feeling like you can't trust her because she isnt sharing the name is warranted, but it doesn't mean there is actually something to worry about.", "I am not sure there is enough info here. She may be not telling you because of something dishonest on her side, or she may not be telling you because she fears you will have some massive overreaction and do something stupid to the guy. We don't know the tone in which you ask, nor how she is actually answering.", "I believe she cheated with guy and started acted panicking out of guilt and fear that you will find out so she made up this story about the teaser and pepper spray to gaslit you and deleted the messages to erase evidence and acted mad because she was afraid she was gonna get caught. Anyway she is a piece of work", "NTA and something is very off. \n\n1. She deleted the texts. The only reason to delete texts is so you don\u2019t see them. This means that something may have happened between them. \n\n2. She\u2019s says she\u2019s mad that you are distrusting and that\u2019s why she isn\u2019t giving you his name. The only reason to be angry at this is because there IS something to be distrusting about and if you know his name, you can find him, talk to him, and then he might tell you what happened between the two of them. \n\n3.

At this point it concerns your family aswell so she needs to be honest about the situation.", "Actually, it\u2019s very normal for women to delete messages because they don\u2019t want to deal with the unpleasantness. In fact when women are being harassed or abused, women centers find that the women who are being abused have deleted all traces of it because also often they might feel like it\u2019s their fault (think a husband who\u2019s hitting his wife and the wife wants to keep up the illusion that the husband is a good guy). So the advice they give the women is to start creating a trail of evidence. \n\nSo that part isn\u2019t so unbelievable. Maybe the woman is just genuinely freaked out. I think the husband needs to calmly sit down and explain to her that he\u2019s worried about her and it\u2019s for her safety he wants the info.

I was also sexually assaulted when I was a little boy. Yes I have seen and lived through many types of abuse, so my question isn't coming from a place of total ignorance. \n\nI find it alarming, however, that a person wouldn't disclose potentially life threatening information to their partner and especially after there is a chance that their children might potentially be involved with the worst case scenario where threats become actions.", "I mean, with that logic I would not told you about any threat nor asked you to buy self defense thing .

If he's actually suffering a real mental health break that spooked her, he's probably not going to ACT rationally, and you need to know if this man knows where you live and if it's a possibility that he could come to the house (whether or not she THINKS he would). If he's threatened her or approaches her again, she doesn't need to hide it, she needs to tell you because it might be grounds for a restraining order or he might need someone not so spooked to alert family to intervene in a mental health crisis with possible psychosis before he DOES hurt himself or someone else while not aware of what he's doing. \n\nI don't know your actual feelings on the matter, but you could tell her you don't really care what she said or did before he started scaring her, because it's possible that she is hiding flirting or something and then freaked. But there is *potentially* a man out there who thinks he's communicating with her dead sister (also a trauma trigger probably) and now believes your wife is pregnant and supposed to be with him. If she's being completely honest, then I'm not sure pregnancy is going to be a deterrent for a man literally not in his right mind. (Most people suffering severe mental illness with psychosis are not a danger to others, only themselves-- I don't want to cast him as a monster. But if he is actually believing and seeing things that aren't there, he could behave in a way that isn't safe *without intending to* while thinking he's protecting or helping her or himself, and pepper spray will not fix that.) \n\nIf she isn't being honest, you still have a right to ask questions, especially if whatever she's hiding was enough to want to arm herself and spooked her so badly she wouldn't go get protection alone or in secret. \n\nFinally, lastly, this man she ran into *might not even exist*. If this behavior-- the panic, the deleting messages, the sudden need to protect herself, the lying, the cagey defensiveness-- are all very unlike her, if she's acting sort of frantic or paranoid in a way that's out of character, then you need to intervene immediately and talk to her enough to determine how grounded in reality any of this is and see if she needs medical help. It could be new meds, a latent mental health issue triggered by stress or illness, etc. I am VERY MUCH not a fan of disbelieving frightened women or treating them like they're crazy, but in a few situations, if there is actually NO EVIDENCE and she's acting very, very out of character, that could be a red flag.", "NTA She could of been indulging in some mild and what she thought was completely innocent flirting that meant nothing, then it escalated into really scary stuff very quickly.

Good luck dude.", "There are some very good points back and forth on this thread. I would never encourage snooping and going behind someones back but since there is real fear and real concern for safety, do you have a family plan with your phone service? Are you able to request message history? Good luck!", "I\u2019m going with NTA, but I don\u2019t necessarily think your wife is a guilty party. I\u2019m seeing a lot of speculation here. I can think of plenty of reasons she would delete those messages and I can think of reasons she wouldn\u2019t. As a woman, I have been in scenarios where I did both. I deleted messages when men made me uncomfortable, I didn\u2019t know what to say, didn\u2019t intend to continue speaking to them, etc. I also had times where I saved messages thinking \u201cthis is evidence if something happens to me\u201d. So I really think there\u2019s no reason not to trust her on this issue. Same with her not telling other people. People get really weird when you tell them someone is creeping you out. It\u2019s almost a default where they defend that person and make you question if you\u2019re overreacting. So the instinct to keep it quiet makes sense here too. All this said, you do have a right to know if you\u2019re in danger as well and she definitely brought you into this by coming to you about protection. She might be afraid you want to confront this guy, etc. But she needs to trust that you won\u2019t confront him and only want to know for your own safety.", "NTA\n\nIf what she says about her stalker is true, then your life and the lives of your children could be at risk.

You seem to have missed the most important fact ENTIRELY. She told him she was pregnant and he got scared. Why would that scare him? And why would she use that to scare him??? That one thing would have red flags going off everywhere. Only way a girl would scare me with that comment is if we slept together.", "My husband is the person I would go to in that situation.

(Or, there's always the possibility they're having an affair, and after he saw you both, he pushed to reveal the relationship.)\n\nI **don't** know though. No one knows, because your wife is hiding everything from you.  Sit her down and tell her you need to hear the 100% truth, start to finish. You need his name. You need their background.

Yeah, right.", "NTA, this whole thing is shady! Gotta wonder if she was having an affair and is now portraying him as dangerous so he won't out her or maybe he has actually become obsessive. \n\nRegardless this doesn't sound true in the way she's tried to sell it to you.", "So, your wife has somewhat of a stalker. He claims that her dead sister talks to him. Your wife perceives him as a big enough danger to arm herself. So I would assume you as her husband and your children might also be in danger. What if he decides to get you or your children out of the picture to have her for himself? \n\nI seriously don't understand why she doesn't want to share more information with you. It sounds like there is a threat not only to her but potentially to her family and she doesn't care about your concerns about it. I am just confused by this. \n\nEven if she doesn't tell you anything more, please look out for any strangers who claim they know your wife or something like that.", "NTA. Never delete creepy messages in the event you need to use them as evidence! Something is a bit fishy on her side\u2026 NGL.", "NAH, It\u2019s so disheartening seeing so many people just assume she\u2019s cheating. Before I got help for my stalker I had initially deleted text messages. I thought, if I deleted them and ignore he\u2019ll go away. He came back and had threatened my life multiple times. For the love of god please be careful. And  make sure you and your family are safe. People are fucking insane.", "It is too bad the apps don't have a way to accept-and-file messages from a person but not have them show up in the main feed. Then, you at least have the evidence without having to look at it all the time.", "It's disheartening to see how many women are popping in to criticize OP's wife or suggest she's lying because they reacted differently in her shoes. Throwing other women under the bus because you think you were better at coping with harassment is some real pick me bullshit.", "All things being equal this might be true. However, OP says he has an ABI and that changes my assessment here. The wife may be acting shady or she may be trying to dance around her husband's impaired judgement and emotional control while also navigating this weird situation. Brain injuries change relationships, especially with your partner. It's a weird, patchy mix of partnership and care giving. It's very hard on both partners, but in this case, I think it is harder on the wife .", "I hope dude OP has started listening to all the women who've experienced similar shit instead of to all the dude-bros yelling SHE DELETED EVIDENCE! SHE'S A CHEATER! And also NO RATIONAL WOMAN WOULD WITHHOLD A NAME FROM A MAN WITH A BRAIN INJURY, IMPULSE CONTROL ISSUES, AND RESULTING VOLATILE TENDENCIES! \n\nIronically, I'm too traumed by my own brief experience to check the full thread again.", "Except OP says his wife's sister died when she was 5 days old...", "OK, I didn't read that... Makes him sound even more mad.  Still, that he said her dead sister talked to him just makes  him more likely to be a mad stalker than an (ex) lover. Unless she has much fantasy and is a good liar.", "I feel like it\u2019s a very fair assumption to think that she might be cheating considering how much she\u2019s guarding information on something that she says is putting her life and is implying the safety of her husband and children from her husband. I would be really disappointed in my relationship if my partner didn\u2019t tell me what was going on if he/she was going through steps to arm themselves. That implies one of two things, maybe both: 1) they don\u2019t trust you 2) they\u2019re hiding stuff from you."]}
