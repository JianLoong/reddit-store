She mentioned it in passing to me and I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nFast forward to Wednesday when I wake up and my wife is a little panicky and asking if we can buy a taser locally. I ask what going on and she tells me she has been communicating with that old friend and that he got bizarre on her - telling her they were meant to be together and that her deceased sister is talking to him. Sounds pretty weird, so I ask if I can read his messages.\n\n\u201cNo! I deleted them because they were silly.\u201d\n\nOk, not was I was expecting. We go to the store and get her some pepper spray and she even buys a bottle for home. Later that night, she tells me that she got him to go away by telling him that she was pregnant. He said he would give her space - again weird. \n\nNow I am reliving the day and rushing to get protection from weirdos and wondering why she would be so satisfied when she was scared earlier. She had told me his name earlier, but I have memory issues from some brain damage and I forgot. I asked for it again so at least I had it in case something happened. She refused. She tells me that she doesn\u2019t want me to embarrass him any more than he already is. I swear I won\u2019t even contact him but feel like it would be safer to know in case something did happen. She refuses. We go back and forth but she won\u2019t do it.\n\nSo here we are a few days later and she still refuses to tell me. She\u2019s mad at me for saying I was having trust issues over this and that it felt like she was hiding something. We\u2019ve been married for eight years. I know if I were in her shoes, I would be telling everyone I know about what is happening. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s told anyone but me.

Please don\u2019t take the advice to immediately conclude that your wife is cheating, that\u2019s so stupid. \n\n1. Why would your wife want a taser to protect herself against an affair partner? To throw you off the trail of an affair you didn\u2019t even suspect her of having at that point? Most convoluted cover up ever. \n\n2. It actually does make sense for her to delete harassing messages. I\u2019ve had it happen to me when someone I blocked kept messaging me from new numbers, I just repeatedly deleted and blocked. Sometimes saving messages for evidence is best practice. Sometimes you know law enforcement isn\u2019t going to do shit about repeated \u201chey gorgeous, why won\u2019t you talk to me\u201d messages, so you delete them for your own peace of mind. \n\n3. Your say you\u2019re not violent, and I take you at you word. But you\u2019ve suffered a brain injury and memory loss, so I wonder if your wife is concerned in any way about your reaction if she told you the name of the person she feels threatened by. \n\nTalk to her, but keep in mind that your are not in her shoes and don\u2019t get to dictate how you think she should be handling this traumatizing experience. Listen, respect how she wants to be supported.", "NAH. You aren't wrong for being concerned, but deleting the messages could have been more about getting them out of her head than preventing you from seeing them.\n\nAs a woman who's been stalked, I think I'm looking at this from a different perspective than the folks who are rushing to tell you she must have cheated. My creeper was scary. It was something I needed to work through on my own though, and having the men in my life go all overprotective did not help. When it started, I went to my friends for advice. They all swore to me they wouldn't contact the stalker. Two of the guys fucking did it anyway, which set off new bursts of creeper activity. He didn't really respond to them at all; I was the one who paid the price.\n\nWhen I look back at that time, one of the things that frustrates me is that my guy friends, despite their good intentions, because one more source of stress I had to manage. So many girls are raised with fathers, brothers, or friends who brag about making sure other men treat us right. Who jokingly threaten our dates. Who clean their guns when we get picked up by a new guy. When I ran into a problem, I felt like I had to hide the full extent of it because all that macho bullshit made me fear that someone I cared about would end up in jail. I had to worry about my safety and work through my feelings about living in fear, and then on top of that I had to manage the emotional responses of every man in my social circle who heard even a fraction of what was going on.\n\nI deleted my creep messages because I didn't want them in my head. That wasn't necessarily the smartest idea; it's usually recommended that you document all attempts to make contact. But I can't say I wouldn't react that way again if I thought there was any chance some stalker's intrusion might cause bigger problems for my friends or family.\n\nYou may never have given your wife any reason to think that you're a hothead who'd go against her wishes, but it does sound a little like you're making her scary situation about you and your feelings.", "NTA, but this sounds very odd. I'm not going to jump to 'she's cheating with him,' because it could be a variety of things, but I'd sit her down when you're both calm and ask her to tell you what happened. If she's threatened to the point she needs a bottle of pepper spray for the home you share, you're certainly entitled to know exactly what the threat is. \n\nI think the odds are very, very low, but there is a chance he threatened her with something from her past, or made a direct threat to you if she says more. Again, I think the chances of this are very small, but I wouldn't go into the conversation with her convinced she's cheating/hiding something she did from you", "Nta\n\nThis is really bad. Either she's lying to you or there's a guy who is dangerously obsessed with her free in the wind. And she deleted all the evidence. How are you supposed to be safe? \n\nThis is not how people who are in danger normally behave.", "It sounds fishy that she deleted the messages. She IS hiding something.\n\nThat being said, she\u2019s also concerned for her safety to the point where she wants to arm herself but won\u2019t tell you\u2026 wouldn\u2019t that mean you\u2019re also in danger?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t let this go, you need more information.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but I suspect she's not being honest with you about the contents of their messages, and why he was hung up on her in the first place.  Suggest you visit a lawyer and a private investigator.", "NTA. Absolutely everything about this is weird and suspicious.", "NTA. She is deliberately withholding important information about someone who is not only putting her in danger, but potentially you as well. Sounds like she maybe went too far in her messaging and she is trying to cover the situation up.", "NTA\n\nYour wife's behaviour is suspicious / curious, but it may just be that she wants to put it behind her and not relive the embarrassment and trauma.\n\nIt may be innocent but you are allowed to feel concerned. Feeling like you can't trust her because she isnt sharing the name is warranted, but it doesn't mean there is actually something to worry about.", "I am not sure there is enough info here. She may be not telling you because of something dishonest on her side, or she may not be telling you because she fears you will have some massive overreaction and do something stupid to the guy. We don't know the tone in which you ask, nor how she is actually answering.", "I believe she cheated with guy and started acted panicking out of guilt and fear that you will find out so she made up this story about the teaser and pepper spray to gaslit you and deleted the messages to erase evidence and acted mad because she was afraid she was gonna get caught. Anyway she is a piece of work", "NTA and something is very off. \n\n1. She deleted the texts. The only reason to delete texts is so you don\u2019t see them. This means that something may have happened between them. \n\n2. She\u2019s says she\u2019s mad that you are distrusting and that\u2019s why she isn\u2019t giving you his name. The only reason to be angry at this is because there IS something to be distrusting about and if you know his name, you can find him, talk to him, and then he might tell you what happened between the two of them. \n\n3. Tell her to come clean or you\u2019d like to have her phone and take it to a place that can retrieve the deleted messages (this probably isn\u2019t a real thing, but it might jolt her into coming clean). If this doesn\u2019t work, you may want to tell her you want to separate for awhile and see what she says. In the very least, you guys need couples counseling.", "NTA . She's cheating.", "Cheating. NTA.", "NTA. She isn't being fully open and seems to be hiding something big. Sounds like maybe she entertained an affair but he turned out to be a weirdo and she got cold feet. The fact she won't tell you his name tells m she doesn't want you talking to him ever, at all. Dump her ass.", "NTA\n\nShe's putting her family at risk for not telling you.", "NTA.  Your wife is not being honest with you .", "NTA I\u2019m sorry but your wife is doing something fishy  buddy because it makes no sense for her to be that scared then delete messages that could help her down the line if he decided to come back around makes no sense in my opinion then she won\u2019t tell you his name ?

My opinion:  she's going back and forth on if she wants to sleep with this guy.", "NTA. At this point it concerns your family aswell so she needs to be honest about the situation.", "Actually, it\u2019s very normal for women to delete messages because they don\u2019t want to deal with the unpleasantness. In fact when women are being harassed or abused, women centers find that the women who are being abused have deleted all traces of it because also often they might feel like it\u2019s their fault (think a husband who\u2019s hitting his wife and the wife wants to keep up the illusion that the husband is a good guy). So the advice they give the women is to start creating a trail of evidence. \n\nSo that part isn\u2019t so unbelievable. Maybe the woman is just genuinely freaked out. I think the husband needs to calmly sit down and explain to her that he\u2019s worried about her and it\u2019s for her safety he wants the info. And that he won\u2019t act upon it unless she asks him to. Those reassurances said in a calm and adult manner should work. But here it sounds like the situation keeps escalating and they\u2019re bickering.", "It definitely doesn\u2019t make sense to delete harassing messages if they are bad enough someone is thinking about needing a taser. That never makes sense. And that\u2019s why it seems so suspicious to so many people.", "You make several good points including pointing out my brain injury. It did definitely change my personality some and makes things a lot harder - stress, temper, etc.  She does say that if something did happen, the cops could get those messages recovered.

I felt that this was threatening to her, myself and my kids which is why I wanted a name.", "Sounds pretty plausible.", "Yeah my sister was like this with her first abusive ex. She had no clue how to handle insane behavior and just wished it all away. If the wife doesn't even think this guy is relevant, just acting insane and targeting her, I could see why she would just wish it would all go away and ignore it.

Share the full, scary situation with your partner so that she\u2019s fully informed about what this person is capable of and can keep safe. You wouldnt delete proof that this person is saying deranged shit to you without reason, shit that could be helpful if you needed a restraining order. \n\nYour partner is up to something, and the most apparent answer to me is that she was somehow encouraging/participating in the romance until it got too intense for her, deleted evidence that makes her look culpable, and made up a story to rule you up on full alert so that you jump into \u201cprotect the family\u201d mode and don\u2019t question her", "It\u2019s very off.

She might be worried that hubs will do something rash, and dude isn't worth it.", "Oh yeah, plenty of women react by deleting the messages.

If it was me I'd definitely want to know what his name was and what he looked like for the safety of not just your wife but for you, you could walk past this bloke in the street or be followed by him and you wouldn't know if he was stood talking to you!\n\nEdit, also sorry but have you considered the possibility that your wife was messaging with him behind your back about extra marital endeavours and panicked when he wanted her to come clean to you and for them to be together? Would explain the deleted messages", "NAH. I know that the deleting part sounds fishy but that's exactly what I did when one of my close ex friend sente his \ud83c\udf46 pics. I just wanted to get them out of my head", "Who the f shops for three hours?", "NTA sounds like she might have dumped the affair partner but he\u2019s not willing to end things.

She needs to be keeping them for the police anyway, when you have a crazy stalker that\u2019s who you go to. Calmly speak to her, explain to her that you\u2019re concerned about her and after rethinking it you realized it was silly to feel distrustful about this because it\u2019s obvious she\u2019s just trying to get it away as quick as possible because she\u2019s afraid. Tell her you\u2019d like to recover the messages because if this continues you need all the proof possible for the police. Crazy stalkers just don\u2019t go away. IF even then she\u2019s saying no to telling you anything about this guy, she was having an affair, and is now gaslighting you to believe anything you hear from this guy is an insane delusion, perhaps that \u201cthey\u2019ve been in love for over a year and sleeping together.\u201d A crazy stalker probably would\u2019ve told her he\u2019d raise her child, (\u201cI love you that much! Etc.) a rational person goes \u201coh a baby? I don\u2019t want to be involved in that.\u201d Crazy people don\u2019t suddenly become not crazy when somebody mentions pregnancy.", "YTA. Why would she want to be vocal about it, when the person who vowed to protect her is second guessing her and acting like she did something to cause it. I swear you guys will try and find a way to defend men you have never met before trusting the women in your life. \nFor the record, this is a fantastic example of why women tend to distrust all men. Because most of the time, even if you are not hurting her, you are making her feel like she is responsible for the problem. \nDo better.", "Dude, she had some text messages back and forth with him she doesn\u2019t want you to see because she participated. \n\nStop being a schmuck and divorce, she planned to cheat on you. \n\nNTA", "nta. hmmmm.. It almost sounds like she has been having an affair and just broke up.. and the op is treatining to go public. Something seems hinky here. Any PIs in your area ? \n Maybe if you mention you are going to hire one you will get the truth..", "NTA. This is a major red flag that she won\u2019t talk about this with you and means she\u2019s probably cheating.", "Sounds like your wife had an affair with the old friend, things went south and now she\u2019s scared. That would explain the deleted messages. Tell your wife to come clean, or else you\u2019ll be serving divorce papers pronto.", "There are so many possibilities here I really wouldn\u2019t jump to being suspicious.", "[removed]", "This is perfect.\nI remember getting pretty seriously harassed by a guy when I was a teenager but I deleted the messages because some of his insults were major insecurities of mine and some part of me was terrified if I showed people they\u2019d say \u201cOh you know what he\u2019s right\u201d lol\nIt might not be rational to delete messages but I doubt many people are thinking logically in these situations", "When I go grocery shopping for the family, I leave at 9:30 in the morning and I get home around 11:30 and I have only give to 2 stores.

The comment above boils down to \"she can't be TA because of how men are\".

Are you sure she\u2019s not scared your temper may get activated and you act violently?", "Okay. But... What would you do with the name if you had it?\n\nLike, let's say she wakes up this morning and decides you're right, then tells you the name. \n\nThen what? How does that make your life materially better? What does it enable you to do that you're not already doing?", "\n\nIt's not long term partner abuse, no, but stalking is abuse.

I am still scared that if I tell someone about my abuse, they will question me for proof.\n\nI think it\u2019s strange to involve the partner in this (go get pepper spray, taser etc.) but not show them the messages. \n\nMy partner recently got a text out of the blue from his ex congratulating us. I wouldn\u2019t have had to ever know it was there, yet he just handed me the phone because he wanted me to see it and talk about how it made him feel. This is normal and transparent in relationships.", "Sadly, they are correct. A quick Google search of \"abuse victims deleting evidence\" shows it is a thing, as odd and counter productive as it seems.\n\nI suspect also that people who haven't been abused or haven't been under a thumb for a long time, who have confidence (& space) to immediately decide that this Isn't On and take proactive steps about it *are* much more likely to keep evidence. Possibly because we have less fear of not being believed or having it all turned around so its blamed on ourselves rather than the abuser.", "Yeah same. I keep all my messages just in case. Sounds like she was cheating and is making up a story. Trickle truth.", "This makes some sense. But don't you think it's incredibly unfair to engage your husband in a day urgently arming yourself with self-defense devices, only to refuse to elaborate on this mortal threat when asked?", "I would be suspicious of this whole thing.", "There is no indication that his wife has been abused so why does the experience of abuse victims matter in this case? For all we know this is a stalker and has nothing to do with actual abuse.", "How do you know they \"have no experience\"?

She could be subconsciously avoiding losing more if you step in even though you're coming from a place of care and not crazy. You already asked to see the massages she was sent when she told you what was in them. She wants your support to negotiate this herself, and you're accusing her of hiding things when it seems she just wants to handle it herself. She doesn't need to add struggling to keep her autonomy on handling it with you, when she's already dealing with him in her way.", "Exactly, especially going against someone who talks the talk. \n\nWhat your partner did is the normal thing to do, he has nothing to hide. \n\nOps wife is only sharing apart of the story which evidently clear, she doesn't even want to share his name, someone that's stalking her? And why doesn't she want to share it? Because she doesn't want her stalker to embarrass himself further. If someone was stalking me I'd have zero interest in protecting them", "I think that I can\u2019t judge or even understand what the wife is doing without more information about his \u2018temper\u2019 and post TBI issues. \n\nKeep in mind that I am a woman. I routinely carry legal (in my state)things for self defense, like mace when I am out cycling. I mean, Ted Bundy was the charming boy next door. I think self defense should be the default. Frequently red flags come to late. She doesn\u2019t have to be actively terrified of the guy to realize she should generally be more prepared for self defense.", "Let's say the messages did happen. If so, his wife has been abused. It's harassment and threatening. \n\nIt's not long term partner abuse, no, but stalking is abuse.

Naming the person she fears and why she fears them can be incredibly hard when your in a traumatic state. \n\nIf that is what\u2019s going on I hope OP is able to set aside making this about his worries about trust because (apart from a understandable concern about his and the children\u2019s physical safety) he\u2019s bordering on making this all about him. He\u2019s not really talked about her mental health etc, but focused on if she\u2019s cheating and lying. Which is only going to make it harder for her to feel safe. \n\nThe way OP describes her behaviour seems at odds with where his focus is. She sounds like she\u2019s having some sort of breakdown, not deliberately undermining their marriage with infidelity. And that\u2019s WITH him framing this to make his perspective the stronger one."]}
