But he\u2019s mad at me now because I rejected his very expensive and nice gift.\n\nBasically, last night we were out for dinner and he tells me that he has a surprise for me. He pulls out a small jewelry box and shows me that there\u2019s a pearl necklace inside. My heart literally dropped, I mean it was gorgeous but my first thought was, this must have been a fortune. \n\nHe explained to me that it was his mom\u2019s before she passed away and that his dad gave it to her. I almost cried I mean the whole thing was so sweet and meaningful. But, I paused and realized that it wasn\u2019t appropriate. I panicked for a moment because I didn\u2019t want to be rude but I just let him down easy. Of course, I thanked him first and told him it meant a lot, but\n\nI told him that since we\u2019ve only officially been together for 3 months and since this is such a beautiful and meaningful piece of jewelry that\u2019s probably very expensive, I wouldn\u2019t feel right taking it. I could lose it or break it and I\u2019d never forgive myself. He looked very hurt and sort of just put it away. I felt bad but he seemed fine the rest of the night.\n\nThis morning I wake up to a text from him that was pretty detailed, he explained that me rejecting it made him feel unwanted and like I was rejecting HIM, not just the necklace. I haven\u2019t responded but I\u2019m extremely confused, I mean yes I like him and I dig him but we\u2019re not so serious yet that I can accept a very expensive and rich backstory piece of jewelry right?

Maybe ask him if it would make him feel better if you wore it around and wore it to events n stuff but that you would feel more comfortable if he held onto it longterm for all the reasons you stated. I mean hey if things work out and this is the love of your life then eventually what is yours will be his and whats his will be yours. necklace included", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve only been together for three months. Why on earth would he give you a family heirloom after three months? I could understand a gift like that if it were a wedding gift but three months of dating? Isn\u2019t he concerned he won\u2019t see it again if the relationship doesn\u2019t work out?\n\nAlso why is he getting SO histrionic over you saying thanks but no thanks I\u2019m not ready for such a gift? Rejecting a gift IS NOT tantamount to rejecting HIM. Little red flag going up there. I agree with others saying he\u2019s getting WAY too attached WAY too soon.", "NTA\n\nThis was such a mature response from you.\n\nAccepting a sentimental family piece - future heirloom, surely - from your boyfriend of three months would be huge. You\u2019re not ready. Good on you for knowing that and good on you for speaking up instead of feeling obliged to accept it.", "NTA - I think you need to pump the breaks on this relationship a bit. Him giving you this gift in the first place was inappropriate. Too much, too soon. However, the bigger problem is his response to your honest feelings and feedback about the gift. He wants you to wear what is essentially a family heirloom, but he doesn't want you to be honest about your feelings if they are at odds with his. At best he is emotionally immature, but there is also a chance that he is being purposefully emotionally manipulative.", "NTA - you are basically 3 months into the relationship and that is the level of gift he should be giving to a fianc\u00e9/wife or at least someone he has been with for several years.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nYou guys are a new couple, you don't even know each other yet or if this relationship is even going to develop, yet he's giving you his late mother's jewelry? \n\nTBH he sounds...weird. He's overly attached after basically no time, and his reaction to this whole thing stinks of emotional immaturity. Obviously it's up to you if you wanna continue, but I'd urge you to reconsider. You can expect some epic mood swings, I think.", "No I actually agree with you something that sentimental value should not be given in only a few months of dating that\u2019s something you give after imo 2 years maybe 1 1/2, but I think you guys just need some better communication that\u2019s they key with relationships", "NTA\n\nIt was actually mature of you to realise that this is too much of a gift so soon in your relationship.\n\nJust explain that or show him this post and the responses.", "NTA. Wayyyyy too early for such a gift. Good for you for denying it. All you can do is try to explain your side again and maybe just tell him \u201cif a few years down the line you still feel the same way about me, you can give me it then, but I need to be in your life a little longer before I will be comfortable accepting such a nice gift.\u201d Or something like that. Good luck.", "NTA.  \n\nMy most recent relationship had something similar happen, except I was the boyfriend and it wasn't a family necklace.  But it *was* an expensive gift.  To me it was how much I liked her, to her it was too big too soon (her preference is much slower than mine).\n\nOur solution was that I bought her something in a price range that she's much more comfortable with and I saved it for her for the following Valentine's Day at which point we would've been together for almost 2 years and she's much more comfortable with it.\n\nPeople in relationships go at different speeds, *and that's ok*. If you communicate and have a healthy attitude it will work out.", "NTA at all. Perhaps to help him understand, you could rephrase him from 'rejecting' to 'postponing'. Maybe ask him to save it for your one or two year anniversary? That way he understands that you are serious about the commitment to HIM but not ready for the responsibility of the jewellery yet?", "Definitely NTA. Such a gift confers obligation to the recipient. No. Too early.", "NTA\n\nThat's way too much of a huge gift with a giant sentimental attachment to it. Dating for three months, this gift seems insanely over the top. Id be uncomfortable with it myself.\n\nThree months is nothing. What happens if you broke up? Yeah, no thanks, don't need that shit storm.\n\nIf we were dating for a couple years or married that might be different.", "You\u2019re not an asshole for rejecting the gift, but it\u2019s important to communicate with your boyfriend about your reasons for doing it. It\u2019s understandable that you feel uncomfortable accepting such a meaningful and expensive gift so early in your relationship. However, your boyfriend may have interpreted your rejection as a rejection of him, rather than just the gift. \n\nIt\u2019s important to have an open and honest conversation with him, thanking him for the gesture but also explaining your rationale for not wanting to accept it. This will show him that you appreciate the thought and effort that he put into the gift, but also that you are being sensible in considering the circumstances of your relationship.", "NTA and talk about how you love it and honored at this stage of your relationship you feel uncomfortable taking it because of the significant family connection with the item.", "NTA you were right to refuse this gift, it's really careless of him to give such a personal thing away, he should really keep that for a wife or a daughter", "NTA.  The gift was wildly inappropriate.  I'm wondering how recently his mother died and whether he's still dealing with the grief.  I mean he will forever, but sometimes in the early stages you do weird things.\n\nAn alternative for you is to accept the gift but give it back to him should you break up for any reason.  That's your call though.\n\nYou seem like a good person.  I hope you work through this with him.", "NTA, OP. It seems like a lot of pressure to accept such an expensive gift after being official for 3 months. Have a sit-down with him about how you feel accepting such a gift.", "NTA... You did the right thing.  I had a pearl necklace I bought for my mother in Beijing's Pearl Market, and I gave it to my WIFE, and she understands that it stays in the family, ei. passes down to my daughter.  For a 3-month relationship, I think it was inappropriate, but I think he has very strong feelings for you.  He might need a little extra loving, but he will be ok.", "So you have been on and off with a 20 year old since you were 17? NTA but he is", "NTA, you were doing a wonderful thing.", "The important thing is what happens from now. You are going to learn who is correct. My husband hopes your BF is just naive and made a mistake. He thinks he is farther along in this relationship than you are and will take this mildly painful adjustment well.  I on the other hand don't see it as a pearl necklace, I see it as a collar. Your boyfriend wants to lock down what he sees as a forever relationship-3 MONTHS IN! To me this a red flag. He even says so. \"You rejected me\" This is bonkers. He is trying to make you commit to something.  He tried to buy you, now he's trying to guilt you. Please Please be careful with birth control. If you still want a relationship with this man, you need to come to it on your timeline, when you are comfortable. Your boyfriend has a chance to say, when you are comfortable we can talk about commitment. Both my husband and I agree You did the right thing. The question is what will your boyfriend do now? Will he coerce and guilt and force you, or will he say I'm a little hurt but you're right I need to slow down.", "NTA it sounds like he is love bombing you. You both are young and unless you plan to settle down soon with him it was smart not to take that gift. It is WAY to soon to give that kind of emotional/expensive jewelry, it seems he is more serious than you are and that is not anyone\u2019s fault.", "You arent the A hole\n\nHowever you should talk to him and say that its a bit to early for such a expencive gift\n\nIt will make him feel better, and maybe he will give it to you in a couple months", "My question is this:  how did you expect him to react?  \n\nDid or do you think he was giving you this as a measure of control?  To hold it over your head?  Or was it a heartfelt gesture of love?\n\nYou say it was meaningful.  What's the meaning to you?  To him, it's probably one step away from an engagement ring.\n\nI don't see anybody as the AH.  But I read it as he's committed to the relationship as permanent, and you have reservations.  \n\nYour reservations may be justified.  I don't know.  Maybe he's immature.  Maybe you both are.  Most people that age are.\n\nMany of the comments here see him as having some nefarious purpose.  You're the only one who can judge that.  To me, there's no evidence on the face of it.\n\nI get the sense that you think the relationship is progressing nicely and is on track;  but this gesture is just premature.  You have to communicate that somehow.", "NTA but I can totally see his side too, you're right to refuse the gift but here is what I would say in response to his text:\n\n\"I am so sorry that I upset you. I want to make it very clear that I really like you and I can see us having a future together, please don't think that my rejection of the gift is in any way a reflection of my feelings for you because it isn't. It was an incrediy generous and thoughtful gesture, but it's a family heirloom with a lot of meaning and I would feel guilty for accepting it when we've only been officially dating a few months. This is a beautiful and meaningful gift, that I would be so grateful to receive if we had been together a little longer. I'm not in any way saying I don't want or appreciate the necklace, but just not right now. If it was something you wanted to gift on an anniversary, I would feel honoured to accept it.\"", "Nobody\u2019s an asshole here. This is just how love goes.", "NTA.  I think the boyfriend was obviously trying to make a grand gesture by giving you something that was his mothers.  Seems like a genuine good guy to be putting his heart out there.  You rejecting it is says to him, \"I don't feel the same way about you\".  I can see how that would hurt.  If I was in your shoes I could see accepting it, but returning it if we should ever break up.  It's a little bit reckless of him to be sharing family heirlooms in such a new relationship, but if he has found another good person in you I think you can handle it no matter the outcome.", "NAH - It's way way way too big of a gesture for 3 months official and I think your choice to reject the gift was very mature of you, but with how big of a gesture this was I understand why he feels like you rejected HIM when you rejected his family heirloom. He's made his intentions very clear here, he's clearly in it for the long run, and that's a beautiful and very vulnerable thing to let someone know. \n\nThere needs to be a talk here where you discuss where you see this relationship going and how fast it goes there. And if it rings true for you; you should absolutely make it very clear that you loved the sentiment, but that you'd feel guilt and pressure with accepting the necklace because it's just so very early.", "NAH\nI get that he's hurt and I get that it's too much. \n\nYou could possibly explain to him that you would love to have anders the necklace at the appropriate time. That if you ever move in together, get married of have a child together that necklace would mean the world to you,but that it's a fiance or wife necklace and not a gf necklace and you don't feel like you'd be ready for any of those things until you've finished college or another milestone or something. \nThat you truly hope he'll offer it to you again in a few years when you're ready to accept it. \n\nYou could also tell him you'd love to wear it on special occasions where you go together (Christmas ,a wedding, an anniversary dinner) but you'd prefer that it does stay in his possession until you both feel ready for you to accept something so significant.", "YTA but your heart may be in the right place. It did not cost your bf anything so the necklace being expensive is irrelevant. I would have accepted it and worn it only on special occasions when you were with him. That takes care of a lot of wear and tear fears. If we broke up, I would give it back.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He shouldn't give his mom's necklace to a girl he's been dating for 3 months.\n\nAre you his first GF? It's sounds like it. A lot of guys have the \"she's the one\" attitude with their first GF and goes completely overboard. I think it very important that you have good open communication about expectations.

My first instinct is that he's trying to fast forward the relationship - I wonder if he's been keener to commit than you were over the last year? If so, it might be him trying to almost 'lock in' your relationship and prove your relationship is serious. If it's been a year on and off, maybe he's felt strongly about you for a long time and he's counting the previous year as part of the relationship whereas you aren't. \n\nI am giving him the benefit of the doubt - there's also a chance he's trying to dazzle you with fancy gifts because he's actually a bit of a control freak and wants you to feel like you owe him something, but that very much depends on his behaviour in the year you've known him. If there's other times when he's been quite full on and intense when you've not wanted that, it may be a sign this isn't the right relationship for you. But, as I said, it might be that he's been in love with you for a year and is just very glad that you're now official.", "NTA. An expensive necklace that was his mother\u2019s is not something you give to someone you\u2019ve only recently started dating. That\u2019s a present you either give to your fianc\u00e9e, your wife or to your adult daughter to mark a very special occasion. You did the right thing and you handled it sensitively. This guy comes across as a bit needy and manipulative if he\u2019s playing the \u201cI feel rejected\u201d card when you told him your very valid reason for turning the gift down tbh. I would re evaluate your relationship with him.", "NTA: But...... you are not on the same page with the seriousness of the relationship. Probably worth a conversation at some point.", "NTA. But try to explain better why you dont want it.", "Is this an attempt at love bombing?", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu and him clearly have VASTLY different expectations.

HE is right, you did that. But there is nothing wrong with that, it ws the appropriate response - you gave him a reality check - you have been dating for 3 months, you are not joing the family permanently yet .. at that pace, does he want a marriage at 6 months, and then move straight straight to having kids?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou need to have a talk about relationship expectations, and how both of you see the relationship and the future (Normally this would happen far later). \"I feel guilty\" .. IF that s still the case after those talks, end the relationship.", "No u were right for turning that down. 3 months? Regular jewelry at that time in the relationship is already a red flag but it was his MOMS that his DAD gave her? Girl, u almost became a fucking lamp shade.

This is a surprising and uncommon type of thing, if I were you I'd assure him that you're definitely not rejecting him and it was a real shock which made the situation feel intense for a moment.

My now wife would have loved that gift after 3 months! Probably because at 3 months I gave her an engagement ring! lol you\u2019re clearly just at different places in the relationship it seems if he is giving you family heirlooms. I\u2019m not saying dump him, but maybe evaluate the relationship and recognize and acknowledge how serious HE thinks you are and whether continuing is what you want, because he is likely to get very hurt if you\u2019re not all in based on how all in he clearly is.", "NTA and the suggestion about weraring it to special occasions but he keeps it is cool. \n\nBUT you realise that this is a pre engagement, right? This gift is way more than just a gift. His dad gave it to his mom (who he obviously married) - so i'm pretty sure you will get a proposal soon. If you are not fine with this pace, you guys should sit down and have a serious conversation about how each of you think the relationship should go to and what the timeline is. Like do you want to be a couple for at least a year before you consider engagement or smthg like that.", "NTA. Frankly, he is accelerating the relationship faster than you are ready and is missing some a social awareness or is being deliberately manipulative about it.  That is an \"I'm ready to make a lifetime commitment\" level gift, which you know and understandably at 18 and after only 3 months,  you are not ready for.  It's not about the gift, it's about the symbolism of the gift. Compromising around it, making it about the gift isn't going to address the  underlying issue: you are in 2 different places in your relationship. \n\nHelp him know you value the romantic gesture, but you are not there yet: that's a wedding day gift and could he please hold it until your wedding day at which time you will happily accept it. In the near time,  flowers please (sweetheart jewelry would be okay,  and you'd know it when you saw it,  but I doubt he would. )", "NTA, it's a very inappropriate gift like you said. His reaction to it is concerning. \nJust know that many people that are rich/come from money don't know how to express love emotionally. They tend to think money= happiness and that money/expensive gift/vacation etc fixes everything. They tend to be emotionally immature as this guy has shown you. My now ex came form money and makes a lot of money and I'm around a lot of hguh earners and they all seem to be like that.\n\nYou on the other hand reacted very mature. You were right that it is too expensive and meaningful at this stage of the game and a gift like that can certainly open the door for manipulation/holding it over your head. If he cannot understand where you're coming from then  he is not the guy for you. Not saying he's a bad person. He's just not relationship material at thsi point and time.", "NTA - Be careful of lovebombing, a sentimental gift like this could be an emotional lure to used against you in the future.", "NTA- he went too big. I\u2019m uncomfortable over here for you.", "Definitely NTA. This was a mature and responsible decision. \n\nI, personally, lose jewelry at an alarming rate. I\u2019d never want anything expensive or too meaningful as I\u2019d be scared to even touch it.", "Maybe explain that such a gift is for a time when you are both looking at marriage together rather than a relationship that is only three months long.

Continue to be kind but firm. Tell him it\u2019s too early in the relationship for gifts like these. Set boundaries.", "I think you did the right thing. It is too soon to receive a gift like that. Could you suggest that he postpone it and that the, if you two are still of the same mind, offer it again? If it works, it\u2019s your for your daughter, if you have one. If it doesn\u2019t, you give it back.", "What kind of pearl necklace? I know you think the necklace was super expensive  but if it was a strand of pearls it could have been as cheap as 75 usd. Pearls aren't as expensive  as some people are making them out to be.", "YTA\n\nThis was his way of telling you that he is damn serious with you and in for the long haul. It's a small step short of \"will you marry me?\". Rejecting him was a terrible thing to do.\n\nThe NTA way would have been to thank him properly, understand the message, and if you are serious worried for the item, keep it in a safe place.\n\nHe, while not an asshole, is a bit naive and stupid to come on so strongly after such a short relation. If he'd been asking, he would probably be chewed out for being too aggressive, too much too quick, etc.\n\nYou've hurt his feelings massively. If you think he might be the one, you'll need to do something serious to make up for it. If he's just a guy for the moment and you're already sure he won't be the father of your future children, now is as good a moment as any to dump him, because you'd be a monster to smooth this over and then break his heart a second time in a few months time.", "NTA.

Like, he just went way too serious too soon, and reacted completely over-the-top about her pointing out how too much it was for her.", ">At best he is emotionally immature, but there is also a chance that he is being purposefully emotionally manipulative.\n\nThis.", "3 months into being monogamous but a year into doing stuff. OP says she's 18, so what are the odds she just turned 18 (checks notes) 3 months ago?", "Yep, this was my first thought, too.", "I\u2019m thinking give it to her wear at their wedding", "Yeah, because at their ages, it's not necessarily a forever thing, either. Obviously, it might be, but it's something from his mum who's died, that's a whole extra tonne of pressure on top of the value and time frame.", ">I on the other hand don't see it as a pearl necklace, I see it as a collar.\n\nI-N-S-A-N-E", "It's a family heirloom, shes 17 and they've only been dating a couple of months. I don't think that the BF is in the wrong either I think most people would feel a little stung after that, but if OP (rightly) doesn't feel comfortable accepting it doesn't really make her an asshole?", "They have been dating on and off for a year, though, so I think that changes things a little.  Doesn't mean she has to accept it but it might explain where he is coming from.", "After a second read through this honestly could give off some weird vibes. How recent was his mother\u2019s passing?? Was the text message in the morning angry or accusatory or mean? Does he come from money in the first place?", "I agree on the comment above, but here's another thought: You could except it as a gift and if the event happens that you guys break up, give it back to him. No matter how long you've been together. That would be a nice and thoughtfull gesture on your end. NTA.", "Their age difference is 3 years, not ten. I'm not sure what you are trying to allude too, but a 17 year old girl dating a 3 year older \"man\" is not something strange or weird. Age gaps are a thing, but a 3 year after gap is just not a big deal.", "Maybe, but there's nothing here to strongly indicate that. 20 yo and 17 yo isn't a wild age gap to me", "Oh come on. 17 and 20 is not that much of a difference.\n\nI get the icky vibe if they had been say 25 and 17 but they are only 3 years apart.", "I didn\u2019t even think of that", "He is just 3 years older, let's not make him a villain.", "I completely agree", "This is beyond reading in between the lines, this is conjuring a whole ass novel out of nothing.", "Yes it is insane to give an 18 y.o. a $ multi-thousand dollar family heirloom after being in a relationship for 3 months-that's my point.", "Yes his family is wealthy to answer your question, but I never thought anything of it. I\u2019m passing this off as a \u201che\u2019s cool, but he didn\u2019t realize that this would come off as weird\u201d type of situation. He\u2019s not a weird PERSON, he just makes eccentric decisions sometimes. The text wasn\u2019t rude or accusatory, he was just being really expressive about how he felt. but it\u2019s true that this was a strange move on his part", "It\u2019s not the age gap, it\u2019s the 17 year old. It\u2019s two completely different parts of life. I just couldn\u2019t have even imagined dating somebody who was still in high school years after I graduated. Even if it\u2019s only a couple. That\u2019s just too weird to me.", "MAybe his mom had TONS of jewelry, so for him it is not THAT big as it seems for you?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"One of the nice pieces mom had, because it would suit you\" is completely different to \"The one heirloom from mom\".", "Maybe you could tell him that you we're very surprised that he would give you such a valuable and meaningful gift so early on since you have not been dating that long. And maybe propose, that he gift this to you once your relationship is a bit older.\n\nI think it was hurtful to reject the gift because you might loose or break it because that seems so careless on your part. Saying you feel this might be very early but you would love for him to consider giving it to you maybe next year or so is vastly different.", "Most of my 17th was during college so this may just be two college kids", "It might not be, my husband met his first wife at college, she was driving her own car and had a part time job same as him. They both still lived at home and neither were old enough to buy alcohol. He was 20 and she was 17.  \n\nIt\u2019s only weird if they\u2019re at different life stages or the age gap is so large as to be predatory. Even people of similar ages could be on wildly different stages.  I have a coworker 22 who has a baby, is married, and owns a house. I have another coworker who is 25, still lives at home, and just needed to her dad to help her buy her first car \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Imagine him asking his father and he says \u201cyeah just give her some of your moms old jewelry\u201d", "I feel like when it comes to age gaps, Reddit takes a super American view on it. In my area, most people are 16-17 when they graduate high school so being 17 and a college freshman isn't at all abnormal here. I don't know about you, but I don't go around demanding to know people's ages before starting a friendship or relationship if we're meeting in a place where it can pretty safely be assumed we're on equal footing and of a similar age...", "I don\u2019t demand to know people\u2019s ages. I am just from America and like you said, things are different here. 17 usually means high school. I still stand by it most times being two completely states of minds. Even if you did graduate, you JUST graduated. Like maybe even months ago you were sitting in a classroom asking to use the restroom. Which could be an American thing. But I just feel like when you\u2019re 20 and you\u2019ve been out in the world for a few years that you\u2019re just way more experienced than a 17 year old. Like sometimes it\u2019s complicated appropriate because context always matters and some things just work, but OPs bfs behavior of giving his dead mother\u2019s heirloom 3 months into a non serious relationship is somewhat alarming and fits why I think that specific type of age gap can be troublesome."]}
