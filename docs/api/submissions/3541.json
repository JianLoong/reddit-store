They moved in with us. \n\nI took him back in with the promise he would do everything better than the first time and do everything he failed to do before as a spouse. He failed to fulfill that promise and we are now broken up again.\nHe still lives in the same house with my son and I. \n\nI had always made it clear I still wanted another child and I asked him a few days ago \u201cwould you still be ok with us having another baby?\u201d\nHe said no, since we were broken up and he didn\u2019t want to bring a child to a \u201cbroken up home.\u201d\nI responded that we had agreed to it before as he knew my long desire to have another baby.

I never asked him to impregnate me or his daughter won\u2019t have a mother.", "If I was awful I would\u2019ve done things differently upon learning about his affair. I tried to oversee it and wanted him to do better this time. He got too comfortable too soon. So I did start believing he came back for alternate reasons. He was ok with breaking up and ok with letting his daughter see me as a mom. I have nothing against her. If anything, the harder part was taking HIM back. Since he was the one who wronged me.", "I actually did think he wanted to be with me. And that it was the sole (of course and our son) reason to come back. Again, it was a question I asked after his response to asking him about another baby.", "By saying that I meant I\u2019m not her bio mom. First time posting on here", "I wasn\u2019t threatening him in ending my relationship with her because I didn\u2019t get my way.", "So I say again: *and*?\n\nBelieving he came back SOLELY out of romantic love and not at all because he wanted his children raised in the same home with the same woman was naive - but it was your choice.\n\nAnd now you\u2019ve raised this girl as your daughter, which again: your choice. It wasn\u2019t a \u201cdeal\u201d, it was a choice. You can say you were \u201cforced\u201d until your blue in the face, but you could have slammed the door on him the moment he showed up looking to move back in. But you *chose* not to do that.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you don\u2019t realize that *you made choices*, and trying to leverage **your choice** to raise his daughter as some sort of favor you did under the expectation he impregnate you a few years later is gross. Implying that you are being \u201cforced\u201d to raise this child, when she presumably thinks of you as her mother and you presumably tell/show her you love her as a mother loves their child, as justification for why you are owed another baby is gross. \n\nSo yet again: he does not want a baby with you. No amount of manipulation or whining will change that reality. You are not entitled to another baby with him, he is not required to impregnate you, he doesn\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d you a child as repayment for raising his. Even if he showed up the day he moved back in with an IOU taped to his daughter\u2019s back and pinky swore if you did this, he would knock you up again, he\u2019s still allowed to change his mind and you\u2019re still an AH if you stomp your feet and demand he owes you.", "I understand what you meant"]}
