There's just one thing I don't like though, and it's created a problem in our relationship.\n\nShe has an interest in taxidermy and collects mainly skulls. It's everything from small lizards to a horse skull. When we started dating a few years ago I assumed she would get over it and move on to another hobby at some point but that hasn't happened. And it's always something I tried to avoid while going to her apartment. So a few months ago we started planning to move in together into a small rented house. Everything was going well until she asked me over text where her stuff would go, including her collection. I half joked and said \u201cMaybe you should sell your taxidermy stuff\" and then later when I met her irl she had assumed I was joking. But when she realized I was being serious this caused an argument.\n\nShe said that the collection cost her a lot of money and she didn't want to get rid of it. Things got heated and I let her know that I thought it was a weird hobby and it had no place in the house. After more arguing she called me childish and two faced for the \u201cweird\" comment and has told me she's reconsidering moving in together.

I'm not surprised she's reconsidering", "YTA.  You started dating somebody who had a long-term hobby, assumed she'd \"get over it\", and were angry when she said she didn't plan on stopping.\n\nIf you think her hobby is weird, go find a different girlfriend.  Don't demand that this one change to suit your tastes.   Why on earth would she want to move into a place where her favorite things weren't allowed?", "YTA. You knew that was a hobby of hers, but assumed she would change. Also, you should\u2019ve had a real conversation with her about it rather than a \u201chalf joke\u201d. You don\u2019t have to be okay with them being used as decor, but you also don\u2019t get to tell her to get rid of them or end her hobby.", "Yta. I collect taxidermy myself. I've got bones, skulls , taxidermy, people parts, wet specimens etc. It's a wonderful hobby. People who like this sort of thing find a beauty in death and anatomy. My husband is not into it at all, it's not his cup of tea , but I've still got my collection in our house on prominent display. He supports my hobby because he understands that is just a part of me. It's no different that  him watching football, I'm not into it at all and think it's a silly game, but I'd never forbid him from watching it in our house.  Same as I'd never forbid him building a computer or watching anime or any other hobby he enjoys.You do not get to police what your partner enjoys.", "YTA\n\n\n\nYou assumed she would get over it.... I assume she will get over you honestly. \n\n\n\nYou really should reevaluate your behaviour, expectations and respect in relation to her as a person. You don't have to like it. So so so many people don't like the hobby of their SO but deal with it and not expect for them to cater to them. \n\n\nThat you look down on her is a real problem and she probably has now realised you do. Hobbies are part of how we express ourselves and our personalities. It is nothing to \"get over\". \n\n\nYou blame her/the hobby for your relationship problems, while she had this hobby and was open about it your entire relationship. You value this hobby and her so low that it seems you don't even consider that you have made mistakes and you are at fault. She was honest. You decived her.", "YTA.

If it makes you so uncomfortable maybe you both can get a cabinet or a cupboard where she can keep her taxidermy.", "YTA You think it's a weird hobby and you didn't take it seriously from the start.

And for calling her hobby weird.\n\nYTA.", "YTA - And your girlfriend is right, you are childish and two faced. You knew perfectly well, who you were moving in with. You have no place trying to dictate her hobbies! This is on you for not taking your girlfriend seriously and thinking \"she would get over it\". You could have said something a long time ago instead of viewing something that's important to her like a temporary whim. This is what makes you two faced! If you had made it clear that you weren't comfortable around her hobby from the start, she would have had a chance to end the relationship, if that is a dealbreaker for her.", "YTA. To not allow her harmless hobby in the new place would be controlling. You surely do things she thinks are weird. It would be one thing to not want it in the bedroom and compromise by her collection staying in a den or living room so you don\u2019t have to look at it all the time. Saying her hobby has no place in the house for being weird is an asshole move.", "YTA. I hope your ex-girlfriend finds someone who loves her for exactly who she is and doesn't want to change her.

You've been with her 3 years & you don't know her well enough to realize her hobby isn't a passing fancy. Either you're too clueless to be an a committed relationship, or you're a selfish jerk. Either way, I hope your GF & her quirky collection move on & find someone who accepts them.", "YTA for dating someone for 3 years who has a main hobby you don't like. So you were just silently expecting her to give it up and change for you? What was your plan for when you'd eventually move in together? How could neither of you discuss this at all during 3 years?!", "YTA - you knew what she was interested in and you ASSUMED she would change her interests to suit you.  Really gross behavior.  You either accept her entirely - or you move on.

Setting aside how dismissive that sounds, does she have a history of suddenly stopping hobbies? If not why would she drop this one? \n\nIt sounds like you failed to have a discussion with her and then were surprised when your own assumptions didn\u2019t come true. \n\nIf you really don\u2019t like it and don\u2019t want it all over the house maybe there\u2019s a room she could have as her study that would have the collection in it.

You can't start your cohabitation by trying to change the other person.", "YTA Your better half is exactly that. You are building a home together. That includes their stuff and yours together.  You already knew about her collection and how important it is to her.  Thinking she would \u2018get over it\u2019 is a little condescending.  Compromise is key in any relationship. Better to learn that now.", "Hahahahah this is hilarious!  Oh my man as jaime Lannister said \"things I do for love\" you have to accept your partner as they are and maybe she should hide the taxidermy in a box...now that i think about it that seems more Jeffrey duhmer than before", "YTA and every single time I've known a couple where one of them actively hates and is dismissive of the other's main hobby/interest in life, the relationship doesn't last. People deserve a partner who loves them for who they are and encourages them to do the things they love.", "YTA. You're allowed to have your opinions about bones/skulls etc., where you went wrong was not bringing up the fact that you're grossed out about them until now. You could have said at the start of the relationship \"ew, skulls? I'm kinda weirded out by those but you do you!\" Instead you just quietly assumed it was something she would \"get over.\" Well guess what, now you're expressing your real opinion and from your GF's point of view it's coming out of nowhere. You need to decide if this is really your hill to die on, from where I'm standing it looks like you're about to throw away a really good thing over some petty squeamishness.", "YTA!!! \n\nOP, I'm an enthusiastic vulture culture hobbyist. This means that I collect bones, skulls, and hides. Often times this means that I'm collecting roadkill off the side of the highway, skinning it, cleaning it, and then cleaning the bones. Its gross, its messy, and it's not pleasant. \n\nBUT.\n\nMy boyfriend has literally come out of the house to see the fox I picked up off the side of the road, simply because I was so excited to find her and he wanted to support me. He listens to me drone on and on about how excited I am that this or that skull is almost done macerating and soon I'll be able to move on to the degreasing process. He made space in his freezer for the fox pelt because I didnt have time to process her just yet and didnt want her to go bad. \n\nDoes he do this stuff too? Not at all. Does he want to? Not at all. But he finds my passion for it endearing, and he supports me because he loves me. \n\nEither support her, or leave her so she can find someone who does. It's that simple.

Let her love what her creepy weird heart loves!", "YTA- in fact you are the one who needs to get over it.", "YTA. It's her hobby. You've know about this for years.

She has this hobby. You\u2019ve known about the hobby. You decided she would just give it up for you even though you never told her you had an issue with it.", "YTA. When in a relationship it's give and take. She has an interest in skulls. So what? You belittling or telling her her hobby must stop because you don't like it is being a jerk. Nobody is forcing you to partake. If you can't accept it, that's fine. Stop dating, and don't move in together.", "YTA. It\u2019s also a branch of Osteology, not taxidermy.

The hobby you patronise and hate will stay with her, quite possibly longer than you will.

I'm sorry, I don't know the answer to your question.

I thought I was in a different sub.  Apologies.  Yes, per your not communicating this to her for three whole years, that makes you (unintentional or not) YTA.  \n\n\nRight now your task is to apologize for keeping your distaste under wraps for that long, and find a compromise if you want to keep the relationship.", "YTA, why don\u2019t you sell all your hobbies.", "Yta this hobby isn't harmless there are th9ngs you can do but this is not it", "NTA - sorry, it's just too morbid for me and honestly if this was the only thing about my partner I didn't enjoy, I probably would have avoided the thought of it for 3 years too, hoping it would go away. Should you have voiced this a long time ago, yes. Would it have made a difference? No.", "[deleted]", "No, not the a-hole, though I will probably get backlash for it.  In my opinion, what keeps you from being the a-hole in this situation is only the \"nature\" of her hobby.  You weren't complaining and asking her to sell a collection of Pez dispensers . . . a collection of Cabbage Patch Dolls . . . a collection of Star Wars fan fiction books.\n\nWhile her hobby is certainly a legitimate one, and even one that for the right person is to be admired, she has to know that the by-products of and the raw materials for her hobby are not appreciated by everyone.  I would venture to guess that the majority of people would be a little weirded out coming home to a room decorated with skulls . . . life-like animals posed who look as if they could just start to breathe or scurry up the wall.\n\nShe is being unreasonable to expect that \"love\" has to extend to one's hobbies . . . that by virtue of loving someone else that you must love their hobbies and must tolerate everything to do with them.  You do not.\n\nHowever, if you truly want to make this work, think of ways you can compromise.  Maybe the skulls, which you seem focused on, need to be put away, in a clear, rolling bin beneath your bed that you don't have to look at, but she can easily pull out and view whenever she wants in private?  Maybe you both could compromise by having her pick out one or two of her favorites and put in a corner of your room that is near her side of the bed, or a place that you can avoid looking at?  Maybe in time you might find yourself a bit desensitized to it, and then you might find more ways to let her express herself?\n\nBut above all else, both of you should discuss how it is not fair to force someone to live in an environment that makes them uncomfortable and that you both have valid reasons to feel this way, but need to find a way to compromise so that one person's need doesn't override another person's feelings of comfort, safety and well-being.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't get it, but when we moved in together, I found a place for him to keep most of his collection and a way for him to display a few favorite pieces. Most of it is in his office, but there is an autographed photo of his favorite player hanging in the living room and a framed poster in the dining room.

Like, maybe they are only allowed in one room. Like her office. Or a shed. But I not be okay with a partner bringing in a ton of taxidermy stuff and especially not them bringing in MORE taxidermy stuff as time goes on living together. So even if you allow her to bring it, I wouldn\u2019t want there to be fights because she\u2019s bringing in more stuff to flood the house.

I know happy, compatible couples who respect and love each other, but draw the lines on what is acceptable in their living environment.

It just means that they respect how that hobby is present in their living environment.   \n\nFor example, one couple, the husband has a beer-can collection in the hundreds that once they moved in together had to go in cartons in the basement as the wife said she could not walk into a room with 500 beer cans lined up on shelves.

Are you truly ready to accept her for what she likes, that might be different from you?

Is the GF into taxidermy?  Or just collecting skulls?  Taxidermy, where you are stuffing a dead fish or animal is very expensive (and can be lucrative if you do it correctly).

But if GF is just collecting random skulls, ie. cats, dogs, squirrels that\u2019s a little strange in my opinion lol ( of course that made me think of the movie \u201cDinner for Schmucks\u201d  ).

Youre selfish to think she would just give up this hobby over time, and especially selfish to think she should give it up for you.", "YTA You knew about the collection and made a stupid assumption that the thing you didn't like would magically go away.

You can't erase a part of someone's identity or the hobbies they enjoy, especially those which they spend a great amount of time and money on. Since ultimately these are a reflection of what they love about life and who they are. I had a partner who didn't enjoy my hobbies and his attitude/unsupportiveness about them, eventually made me take less part in them.
