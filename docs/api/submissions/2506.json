Kids have no place at an overnight adult party with alcohol and little supervision.", "NTA. It was probably because you caved on the wedding, that she thought you would cave this time too.", "Your sister sounds like an entitled asshole. As a parent I just can't understand why anyone would bring their kids to a child-free event. If you can't find a sitter, stay home.\n\nNTA. Good for you for sticking to the boundary you set and not enabling her.", "NTA - you made it abundantly clear that the party is a kid-free one.  She chose to bring her kids anyways, so she needed to leave.  As far as \"what about the kids\", that's a her problem and not a you problem.  She needs to learn to respect the rules/boundaries you have for events.  Just stand firm and keep holding her to them.", "NTA. I have a kid and have had to miss events because it's no kids and I can't get someone to watch him. I'd rather miss an event than bring my kid where he's going to get into stuff he shouldn't, I can't enjoy the event, or even worse I'm inebriated to where I can't safely watch him. Most of all if he's not invited he's not invited and I have to respect that.", "NTA, majority of the time children aren't allowed in bars and it sounds like the party had an open one.", "NTA - your party your rules. You made it clear, she didn\\`t listen. Party on dude...", "NTA. You said no kids and she ignored you. For the kid's safety you told them to leave.  She is TA for disregarding your rules and putting her kids in that atmosphere.", "NTA. Your party, your rules.", "NTA. If you are asked not to bring your kids to an event, you don't bring your kids.

It worked once, and you didn't let it slide this time.", "NTA & I'd have wife ask her sister why she feels she's entitled to not follow the no kids rule set & communicated for these events. Not every occasion is suitable for children & some parents want an excuse to have a child free night. She needs a trusted babysitter or her husband can stay home & parent the children while she celebrates with her sister.", "NTA. She tried to break the no kid rule again like she did at the wedding. No kid rule is not always to keep a place like a wedding child free, it's about their safety and well being at events like this.

Let me put this in a different perspective. I grew up in a family where I, my siblings and cousins all had to sit around while the adults drank. It was so annoying as a kid to be stuck around a bunch of drunk people! Some of which we didn't know (which later lead to me being SA'd at a family gathering by a stranger) Not to mention the lack of supervision, I started sneaking drinks at 11 because there was nobody coherent enough to notice. While it was my parents responsibility to watch me and my siblings, things could have been so much easier if kids were made to stay home.

Good luck with your English lessons", "That was in reference to the wedding though; I could see it being like \"no kids under 12\" and described as \"partly childfree\" after the fact.\n\nIt reads to me like they were very clear about this current party being completely childfree.", "Makes more sense than what I quoted.", "NTA - you were very clear about it being a child free event. If this is the 2nd time she\u2019s done this I would stop inviting her to things", "NTA.\n\nNo kids at the inappropriate-for-kids party. Pretty clear. Does your wife have any idea what her sister's problem is? She's totally out of line and her attitude while doing so sounds appalling.", "NTA\n\nJust what kind of parents are they? Teaching their kids that rules don't apply to them. And letting their kids attend ab adult party. No, just no.", "NTA- I will never understand how parents think they\u2019re kids are so special that they should be allowed to child-free events. They always know better and think showing up with them anyways gives them an automatic exception. I\u2019m a parent and couldn\u2019t imagine trying to pull that on anyone.", "NTA\n\nNo defence for trying to bring children to a childfree event. It\u2019s rude and disrespectful to everyone else there and more often than not, uncomfortable or at least boring for your precious kids.", "Dude YTA for not checking your spelling and typo\u2019s.
