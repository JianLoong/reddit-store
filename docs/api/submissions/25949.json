BIL purchased a cable company last year - he rents out canoes for the river rides and also has campgrounds along the river that he manages. Since the purchase, he\u2019s been constantly asking us for help. And not a one time favor, like he\u2019s in a bind: he wants us to drive down there and clean the cobwebs, do landscaping, and manage the rentals for free. We\u2019ve basically just avoided it, and are getting lots of snide comments from him, his fianc\u00e9, and my in laws all the time.\n\nThis summer, we had our first daughter\u2019s christening (she\u2019s 6 months). We had the reception for it in our backyard and initially wanted it to be small but it kind of ended up turning into my husband\u2019s family reunion. I will say his family doesn\u2019t help us with much (they\u2019re super stingy so we always pay, they never helped us move back when we were broke in our young 20s, weren\u2019t around when our daughter was born, etc.) but they did show up the morning of to help set up, which was nice. BIL and his wife probably spent 3 hours setting up and he did help grill during the party.\n\nNow, BIL has asked us to come work again since they have a big fall event weekend. He wants us to stay for the weekend and says I can manage the rentals with my daughter (paperwork and payment) and my husband can help him get everything ready for winter. My husband said he wasn\u2019t sure that would work, and my BIL reminded him how he helped with the christening (which he\u2019s also been bragging about to family members - we keep hearing about how \u201che grilled over 200 burgers!\u201d From cousins). He got a little angry and said family helps family and our act is getting real old.\n\nIn the 10 years of knowing my husband, that\u2019s the only time they\u2019ve ever helped us. And we would happily set up for an event, but honestly don\u2019t want to work two twelve hour days. He can\u2019t see the difference so we kind of avoid it in general.

I'm not saying there is anything wrong with people opening a business that involves free family labor in the early stages but it isn't a plan.\n\nIf your business can't support the staff needed to support the business, you don't have a business.\n\nNTA", "Helping for an event isn't the same as doing a ft job for someone.

No calls, no messages, no visits", "NTA.\n\nBIL asks much too much of you in general, and I suspect he grilled burgers for you only to set up a way of guilting you into doing far more for him than grilling burgers.\n\nMaybe it will take guts, but you have to tell him no and go very LC with the flying monkeys. If it means no longer having any sort of relationship with BIL, I'd say you're ahead of the game. You can grill your own burgers.\n\nHe's a cheat and a sneak. You're better off not knowing him.", "NTA. It would be different if he asked help for something in his personal life (like setting up a family party) but he should'nt rely on free labor to keep his business running.", "I would have given him money for his \"help\" and told him to sod off.  Now you never have to listen to his sob story again.   Well, that is just me.  You don't have to, and help should be voluntary not some family obligation. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Family helping family by setting up some folding chairs and grilling burgers for their own family reunion party is not the same thing as asking family to act as employees working full shifts in your business ventures.", "NTA. \n\nBut BIL didn\u2019t \u201chelp with your party\u201d. \n\nHe helped with his own  family\u2019s reunion - that you helped with MORE because you hosted it at your house. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how history has been re-written on this one. \n\nYou say that you wanted a SMALL backyard christening event. \n\nIt turned into a large family reunion. \n\n**The event that BIL helped with was not your party!!**\n\nKeep repeating that - to yourself & to other people. And especially to BIL and MIL.", "NTA. Regularly helping with a business is not equivalent to cooking 200 burger for 1 events. \n\nYou could give him 1 full day of help, which would probably be already more than all the help he provided and then tell him, we repaid our debt to you and we never gonna ask you help ever again.", "NTA.\n\nYou're family, not free labor.  They feel they are entitled to everybody's time and efforts for free cuz \"you're family.\"  Heck NO!\n\nIf you really feel that you must, and it's not too inconvenient, go help for a few hours.  That should be even.  How entitled to think that 3 hours of setting up table & chairs & putting up decorations requires an entire weekend of working their event.  It isn't even remotely equal.", "NTA\n\nHe is not asking a favour of a family member, he is asking for full employees for two days, those are different things.\n\nIf he wants to host a barbeque (and pay for the food) then sure, you owe him a few hours setting up tables and manning a grill, but that's it.\n\nAnd that would only really be if you had made the request of him to turn up early specifically to lend a hand. If he turned up early of his own accord and started helping then that is a gift from him, not a favour to be owed.", "NTA. Let your BIL know that the next time he hosts a large family celebration you will be happy to help him. \n\nBut being free labor for his business is not part of the deal, he needs employees.", "One is a family event, the other is a for-profit business.", "NTA. Helping out with a family BBQ does not equal, basically,  running someone's business without pay for entire weekends.", "NTA - the little help they did, they see it as a quid pro quote and it was really minimal assistance.", "There is a big difference between helping out at a family gathering and donating your time to his business.  He is trying to profit off your free labor (or rather his business model is crappy and he can't afford to actually run his business).  Helping out at the christening benefits the entire family, helping out at the business benefits one person who should be paying (and insuring, especially given that there is physical labor, someone can get injured) employees.   His business is just that, not your hobby.  Ask him if he will donate the same amount of time at your workplace?", "NTA. I would suggest not accepting their assistance ever again because clearly they don't work for free and you suddenly owe them. People like this do nothing but aggravate. Not the kind of people I would want to be around.", "BIL is cheap and a user, guilt tripping you into working for free on the basis of grilling a few burgers is utter bs.\nNTA.", "NTA .... it's kinds stupid of him to expect you work for free in this economy and with a young child ... if he wasn't capable of managing his own business he shouldn't have purchased it , simple as that.", "NTA. He is running a business. It is on him to properly staff and manage said business. If he wants people to help with that business then he should either hire outside help, or if he is going to rely on family then he should be expected to pay fair labor wages to said family members. That is how business works.", "NTA. He only helped you so he could turn it around on you and try to \"collect.\" \n\nAlso, he helped out at a family event which is pretty standard for family helping family. What he wants is unpaid labor for his business. But if his business takes off and he's raking in money, will he give you all any kickbacks? I highly doubt it.", "NTA It's not your business, and you have no obligation to help him. Especially since you have a young child. He should have thought of that when he bought the business. If your MIL is so upset, she can go help him.", "NTA  You have a new baby to contend to.  BIL is an AH.  let him hire someone", "Send him 200 grilled burgers and a cheque for whatever he would pay an actual worker for 3 hours labour. Note attached \"debt repaid, we are even, stop asking us to be unpaid labour\"", "Help him for 3 hours and be done with it.", "12 hours x 2 days x 2 people = 48 work hours.\n\nThat's quite a return on investment he's expecting for his 3 hours.", "op=nta\n\nThere is a difference between choosing to help at a family event(1 day) and HELPING(for free) for Multiple days at a business--if he needs help, he needs to hire.\n\nAnd you are supposed to drag our 6 month old out to this rustic location?--yeah no\n\nIF MIL is so disappointed, why can't she help?", "NTA, he wants free labor, hire some kids.

Tell him that you can offer 6 hours of help, exactly what he and SIL gave at the christening. Let him know that helping once for a party is not equivalent to an entire holiday weekend of free labor.", "Stepping up and helping at a family event for mostly HIS family is quite different than asking you to work for free multiple times. He's TA for trying to take advantage of you. When you do someone a favor its a FAVOR, not leverage to manipulate people into doing shit for you.

Them helping set up at the christening by no means obligates you to repay them with long hours of unpaid labor.

Look into local laws. That could shut down this whole situation quickly.", "Nta", "NTA. Tell your BIL that if he has a christening you will show up for 3 hours and grill the hamburgers.", "NTA he volunteered to help at a family event.  he seems to be expecting you to basically work for his business for free.

If it was 3 hours, you\u2019ll give 3 hours back.", "NTA but I'm  confused. In your original post you said they don't help but then in a comment you said they are the kind of family thst drops everything to help out. Is it that they don't help you and your husband but do help others? Either way I think what he's asking for is a huge ask and it sounds like he didn't plan well opening this business if he was relying on everyone to jump in and help like it's an actual job but for free. There's a big difference in helping set up for a party and doing some grilling (although I will say 200 burgers is a lot I'd that number is accurate) for one afternoon. You don't have an obligation to help at all, but for the sake of family harmony maybe you could offer to help for a day or your husband could drive down and help close up on the last day while you stay home and care for your child (or vice versa whatever works). If he doesn't get it together and hire appropriate help the business isn't going to last that long anyway.", "NTA, but just so he couldn't hold that one assist over my head forever, I'd send the husband to work with his brother for the fall event for just one day.

A 9 year old could figure out that\u2019s not comparable.", "NTA\n\nThere's an enormous difference between doing a few hours of set up and manning the grill for a family reunion and working 12 hour days unpaid for multiple days in a row, unpaid, for a profitable business.\n\nFor one thing, if your husband was injured while volunteering, your BIL's insurance might not cover him like it should an employee.\n\nIf your BIL wants you guys to work for him, you need to be employees on the books, covered by Workers Comp.

If it\u2019s supposed to be equal, big bro has a big debt to repay before he gets any help.", "I thought this was going to be \"BIL gave us $10K\" kind of help but he wants to turn you both into indentured servants because he *grilled some burgers*? Not just no, but fuck no. WTAF...", "NTA that was her choice! He helped for one day, for an event he was a part of! He shouldn't be holding this over your heads when he expects so much more work from you than he did!", "But they didn't drop everything to help you and your husband when you needed it. \n\nYou didn't ask BIL to help at the Christening, he volunteered.
