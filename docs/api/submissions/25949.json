BIL purchased a cable company last year - he rents out canoes for the river rides and also has campgrounds along the river that he manages. Since the purchase, he\u2019s been constantly asking us for help. And not a one time favor, like he\u2019s in a bind: he wants us to drive down there and clean the cobwebs, do landscaping, and manage the rentals for free. We\u2019ve basically just avoided it, and are getting lots of snide comments from him, his fianc\u00e9, and my in laws all the time.\n\nThis summer, we had our first daughter\u2019s christening (she\u2019s 6 months). We had the reception for it in our backyard and initially wanted it to be small but it kind of ended up turning into my husband\u2019s family reunion. I will say his family doesn\u2019t help us with much (they\u2019re super stingy so we always pay, they never helped us move back when we were broke in our young 20s, weren\u2019t around when our daughter was born, etc.) but they did show up the morning of to help set up, which was nice. BIL and his wife probably spent 3 hours setting up and he did help grill during the party.\n\nNow, BIL has asked us to come work again since they have a big fall event weekend. He wants us to stay for the weekend and says I can manage the rentals with my daughter (paperwork and payment) and my husband can help him get everything ready for winter. My husband said he wasn\u2019t sure that would work, and my BIL reminded him how he helped with the christening (which he\u2019s also been bragging about to family members - we keep hearing about how \u201che grilled over 200 burgers!\u201d From cousins). He got a little angry and said family helps family and our act is getting real old.\n\nIn the 10 years of knowing my husband, that\u2019s the only time they\u2019ve ever helped us. And we would happily set up for an event, but honestly don\u2019t want to work two twelve hour days. He can\u2019t see the difference so we kind of avoid it in general.

In your original post you said they don't help but then in a comment you said they are the kind of family thst drops everything to help out.

Either way I think what he's asking for is a huge ask and it sounds like he didn't plan well opening this business if he was relying on everyone to jump in and help like it's an actual job but for free. There's a big difference in helping set up for a party and doing some grilling (although I will say 200 burgers is a lot I'd that number is accurate) for one afternoon. You don't have an obligation to help at all, but for the sake of family harmony maybe you could offer to help for a day or your husband could drive down and help close up on the last day while you stay home and care for your child (or vice versa whatever works).
