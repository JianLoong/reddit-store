Toilet training has nothing to do with intelligence. There are many, many reasons why kids on the spectrum find it hard to learn to use the toilet.", "YTA \n\nYou feel as if your sister owes you an indepth explanation for her decisions, but she doesn't. You have no idea how different it can be potty training an autistic child. He could very well say when he needs to use the bathroom (which I would say is evidence of some level of potty training, btw) but that doesn't factor in the many sensory aspects involved with using the bathroom. It can literally vary each time. My autistic son was potty trained in VPK, but he had such a hard time using the bathroom at school. It was heartbreaking. Btw, my son is high functioning as well. He is brilliant, engaging, empathetic, and he has unique challenges. Unless you know the specifics of how autism effects your nephew and all  of the ways your sister works to help meet his needs you  have absolutely no right to judge your sister. You have  no idea how isolating it is to have such deep challenges that are invisible to others, and then you throw out hurtful words. Why not offer support instead of judgement? How was your comment remotely helpful? You are absolutely an asshole for taking the low road here.", "YTA. Toileting issues are very common with kids on the spectrum, and if he has \u2018many sensory issues,\u2019 that could well be a source of problems. You say you\u2019ve barely seen them attempt potty training, but do you live with them? Have you had in-depth conversations with them about exactly what they have and haven\u2019t tried? Did you think to *ask* what about his autism was making it difficult? Let your sister parent her own kid, and stop trying to interfere where your opinion is clearly not wanted.", "YTA. You\u2019re not his therapist and your judgment is unhelpful and inappropriate.", "YTA - so are you with her 24/7? How often do you see her to know exactly what they do or don\u2019t they? What does their pediatrician say?\n\nYou\u2019re making blanket generalizations about autism and disabilities in general. I would expect better from a parent who has a child like one.", "YTA. You\u2019re very ignorant about autistic kids and toileting. Comparing autism to deafness is asinine. Climb off your sister\u2019s back.", "I don't think high functioning means what you think it does.. And I barely know anything about asd and even I know that.... YTA", "YTA.\nPathological demand avoidance thing for a reason. It is very common in autistic children.\n\nBy the way, the label high functioning is considered disrespectful.", "YTA\nDeaf and autism are 2 completely different things to have to take into account.\nYou don't know what they have or haven't tried. You are not his parent. \nEspecially if he has sensory issues, using the potty might just be really hard and stressful for him. \n\nYou come across as a judgmental prick who thinks he knows everything there is to know about parenting because he so happens to have 2 kids himself. You could have 10 and still have no clue what you are talking about when it comes to his specific needs. Hell, you could have raised 10 kids on the spectrum and still have no clue what works for your nephew.", "I've worked with autistic  children who were 10-13 and saw no problem peeing in their underwear because sometimes part of having problems socially is not realizing why people use a toilet or take showers or brush their teeth. And a good chunk of these kids were low support needs (a better term than high functioning). They just didn't see why they needed to stop what they were doing to go to the toilet and having wet pants really didnt bother them. \n\nAlso, a child who can't hear but at 3 you were presumably able to communicate with via sign is easier to potty train than a child who doesn't understand why he has to interupt his life to do something he doesn't want to do and has no desire to change anything.", "YTA\n\nToilet issues are very common with kids on the spectrum and it\u2019s absolutely a very different case than your disabled child.\n\nMind your damn business and educate yourself before you even think about talking to your sister about how to parent.", "I agree with you that generally a child should be day trained by 5.

Most Autistic children do not fully potty train well into their teen years. If you had even a little clue about Autism, you\u2019d know that.

Seriously, your nephew has autism, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the disorder and make sure you apologize to your sister.", "YTA. Kids with Autism can have Interoception which affects their ability to notice body sensations and this can severely delay potty training. One of my kids didn't fully potty train until after age 5. You have no idea how hard this can be, and believe me I tried and finally had to accept that my child would train when they were ready. You have no business commenting on this.", "I wouldn\u2019t worry so much about the Potty training as the lack of early childhood education for this child! Yikes!", "YTA. Autism presents itself in many different ways, and toileting is often difficult. Add to that, many parents of children with ASD struggle with depression, anxiety, etc.,  especially early on. Regardless of how often you are around, you don't know all of the nitty-gritty details. Mind your own business.", "Your evidence that your sister is a lazy parent is based on small snippets of her parenting, not how she handles it 24/7, and biased opinions despite zero experience with raising an autistic child.  You seem to forget that every child, autistic  or not, is different so how they're raised is also different.  Your way isn't the only way nor does the fact that your children were successfully potty trained give you any right or authority to insult your sister in the guise of offering unhelpful \"advice\".  YTA", "YTA mind your business", "YTA. It is painfully obvious you have no experience/knowledge with autistic children. This is a very common struggle for a lot of ASD kids especially those with additional sensory difficulties. You owe her a massive apology.", "yta! holy heck you'll never win brother of the year. your sister is struggling and instead of trying to help you call her lazy. you then have the NERVE to compare having a deaf child to a child being AUTISTIC, it is NOT the same op. potty training is like disrupting a routine times 10 which can be AWFUL when you're on the spectrum so yes its his autism. break downs, panic attacks, screaming, refusing to use the bathroom COMPLETELY. this is what your sister is more then likely dealing with and its worse then normal kid tantrums. when you trained your kid you just had to work around him not being able to hear. apologize to your sister and start being a descent brother by asking her if she needs help WITHOUT JUDGING HER", "YTA. Read the other comments for reasoning.", "YTA: You just admitted in your post he has sensory issues that a major factor in potty training. \n\nGet off your high horse every child is different and being deaf and having a kid the autistic and has sensory issues are not the same thing.\n\n\nBtw I have a niece that is high functioning \nAutism and it took until she was about 5 to use the toilet and it wasn\u2019t due to her parents being lazy.", "YTA.\n\nWhether her decision to not potty train is valid or not, it\u2019s really none of your business, and it\u2019s an AH move to shame them. Having a deaf child is entirely irrelevant as you really don\u2019t have any idea of what it\u2019s like to raise their kid all day, every day.", "YTA. And hugely ableist. I really dislike people like you and how you think you know better than the actual child with autisms parent", "YTA. If you are not a trained therapist or medical professional then butt out. Regardless of the reason your nefew is still in pull ups, not your kid, not your business", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not your business. If he were neurotypical and 10 years old it still wouldn\u2019t be your business.", "YTA. you clearly don't understand autism dont have another child before you do bc i'd hate for you to parent one with it", "YTA hugh functioning or not, Autism can be debilitating & absolutely valid reason for not having toilet trained at 5. He'll get there when he gets there. I have a high functioning autistic chikd (didn't realise at the time) and pushed him too hard to train when he was little. Was changing wet clothes several times a day for ages when he should've just been in a pull up a bit longer.", "YTA. \nAs a mum to an autistic child, i feel for the whole family. I've done all the in-depth stuff you say but also taken a step back to just mentally and emotionally give me and my child both a break from the stress of it. \nChildren on the spectrum work differently, and every one of them is different. You have to try until you find what works for your individual child. Sometimes, the 'normal' processes dont work. And with all due respect, your child, who is deaf still probably has normal cognitive ability, whereas many on the spectrum do not. \nMy son wasn't trained until 6-7 years old. He's a marathon child who learns slowly no matter how you approach the subject. Once he's got it, he's got it, but it takes forever. \nPushing too hard can make things so much harder in the case of kids on the spectrum as their limits and ability to process can get overwhelmed so easily. \nSo instead of judging from the outside, maybe do some research. Try and understand but also empathise that being 'lazy' as you call it (which i disagree with, it's not always laziness) is sometimes needed to give the child a break and time to make those neural connections which can form differently or take longer to form. \nSide note, parenting a child with autism can be really hard. And emotional. And just all around something, you need a lot of knowledge and patience to do well. It's a different animal than a 'normal' child, and always being 'on' in regards to that type of parenting is exhausting. They deserve a small respite. Granted, if a parent is knowingly making no effort, not trying to learn etc etc, in regards to their child (spectrum or not), then yeah, call them out. But just try to have some empathy before you judge. \nIf there is anything that I've written and the language used offends anyone, i apologise. It's not intended at all, but i just use the language i use in everyday life, which my son and other disabled people im around are ok with.", "Getting alot of YTA because you are man. He should be potty trained but I doubt they need comments from the peanut gallery either. I've been a nurse a long time. Alot of progress can be wiped away in an instant with someone on the spectrum. One person coddling them can set them back years. Parents who don't establish a routine or frequently break it are going to struggle badly. Instead of telling her she's a lazy parent you should have been supportive to see if they have been struggling and meeting failure. Shouldn't have torn her down you should have built them up. If you truly feel they are being neglectful call CPS. If you dont think CPS needs to be involved then shut it unless you are trying to support and help them.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe all of the y t a on this one.", "Yta. It\u2019s different for all kids and honestly, it doesn\u2019t help to judge.", "NTA. Although the name-calling wasn't called for; your nephew to not be in school at all because of the lack of being potty trained is crazy. Yes, all kids learn differently, but consistency is key. You can't brush the issue off just because you don't feel like it or because you're working, like, come on now.", " NTA\n\nI agree - she is a lazy parent. My oldest is on the spectrum and he was potty trained at 3. I literally took him home immediately after his special education class just to potty train him. It took us a couple weeks to get him to understand what we were trying to do.\n\nIt\u2019s A LOT of work I won\u2019t deny it but the fact that she won\u2019t even try tells me she is lazy af. My husband and I busted our asses 24/7 to help our child\u2019s development just so he could at least be on the same level as his peers when he started Kindergarten and our hard work paid off tremendously. \n\nIf she (and her husband) doesn\u2019t put in the work then he may very well never get off the diapers.

In the future it's not being allowed to hang out with his friends.\n\nShe's treating her kid like he's in a wheelchair when really he isn't that different than any other kid.

Like yeah it\u2019s not the exact same thing but damn. NTA btw. Yes, it is probably way harder to potty train a child with sensory issues but consistency is key with things like that. It sounds to me like it\u2019s easier for her to just not deal with the struggles of potty training at all and let her kid wear pull ups all the time. It\u2019s just going to fuck that kid up in the long run. The fact that this issue is now impacting his enrollment in school is also a big problem. This kid is already going to struggle with socializing and now he\u2019s going to be even further behind his peers. She\u2019s setting him up for failure because she doesn\u2019t want to do the hard but necessary thing.", "NTA. Not being potty trained or not being in school will ultimately hurt this poor kid more socially.\n\nYea it\u2019s tougher with kids on the spectrum. But you still make the effort which, per the comments also, it seems the kids parents don\u2019t.", "NTA\n\nI'm also autistic and my grandma potty trained me at like 3 or 4 I think.\n\nI don't understand the controversy here. Yes, being deaf is not the same as being high-functioning autistic, but that doesn't excuse her to not even TRY to potty train her son. If nobody's potty training him, you should.\n\nName-calling may be a little too far though.", "I'm autistic and the way your sister is treating her son is insulting.\n\nNTA.", "NTA,  tbh I think kids with higher support need\u2019s should have parents potty training them.   However I will admit i don\u2019t know what type of support needs on his autism spectrum you\u2019re nephew has.", "NTA.  You just stated some facts.", "I'm very torn on this one, she should be trying harder to get him toilet trained so he can be in school with other kids his age, his autism is no exuse for him to miss out on an education but also if its really that hard then she needs to be thinking about education plans that she can put in place so again, he can go to school, it sounds like you know the situation a lot better than reddit does (who knew) given the fact you spend a lot of time there, but 'high functioning' that term is awful btw, in some areas does not mean 'high functioning' in other areas, however again she should be trying harder not just leaving him in pull ups waiting for him to tell her he's used it, there needs to be action taken, it just sounds like she's waiting for something", "YTA.  yes, you are perfect. Congratulations.  Go and apologise to your sister.", "YTA\n\nYou started off well asking your sister questions.  But, then you made an insulting judgement. When in the history of talking has telling someone they were lazy ever motivated someone to a good result?\n\nBeing at someone's house 4 out of 7 days a week still doesn't mean you know all of the facets of their life.  You may be right about some things.  And it's good that you care.  But, be supportive.  Not insulting and judgmental.

Homeschoolinh could be a good option as long as they can afford it and do it properly.", "Best way for me to put it honestly. She's treating the kid as if he can't do anything at all where as he just needs a little help. \n\nIt's one of the biggest things that pisses me off honestly. Your kid isn't a lost cause, he/she just needs a little extra help.", "Not if he isn\u2019t potty trained. Most schools require students to be completely potty trained before enrollment unless they have some sort of documentation stating that they need special accommodations. In that case, it would lead to them having an independent health plan (or some other accommodation type) that would allow to get around that. High functioning autism would not get him that kind of accommodation. Period. The bigger issue here is the fact that he is not being registered for school over this. All of this is her choice and her decision is going to negatively effect the kid.", "She works with her BIL, but I grew up watching tasteless soap operas during the 90s, my mind didn't go a kind place after OP's internalized misogyny towards her sister.", "Bc I work with my BIL, bring the kids and the wives chit chat. Bc we\u2019re family?", "Kids who aren\u2019t potty trained can\u2019t always attend these.", "And let me tell you what happens when you can't afford the fancy inclusive preschool for autistic kids. They get kicked out, repeatedly, from the non inclusive programs, snd it diminishes a child's natural love for learning. Or if qualify for special Ed preschool, then you worry about them being too rough with your kid, or how they're treating them, are they weaponizing your kids favorite things to get them to comply with quiet hands and still feet. Or your kid has just enough skills that you don't qualify for special Ed preschool because they don't need speech or OT. Or you make too much for head start, since it's a federally funded income based program.", "Plenty of kids don't attend those sorts of programs, which are often full of busy-work and fluff to window dress for parents who want to give their kids a 'head start'.\n\nAnd I know, because I design programs for that purpose, and the ones I see (not mine, obviously) are often absolute drivel. Pretty drivel, but drivel.", "My son is autistic. Sending a child with high care needs to school is terrifying. Every day we see articles of kids being abused in special education classrooms. These kids aren\u2019t always able to communicate abuse, making the thought of school terrifying. \n\n\nYTA for the potty training comments, too. None of this is your business. It is not loving or supportive, and it is not helpful. Stay in your lane.", "And there\u2019s also costs to that depending on location. Some of them are only a couple hours long which depending on the parents working schedule may not work.\n\nDepending on how the child acts, and how the school handled things it can be a disaster to attempt.\n\nThere\u2019s also very little education being done in preschool. It should be mainly fun and games.", "High functioning autism does not mean your nephew will be a wunderkind. He might not have academic achievements or learn how to use the restroom. At least where I'm from, the additional support is focused at teaching socially acceptable behavior, focusing on tasks and learning how to be independent. You've watched too much of \"The good doctor\".", "Two of my kids went through Pre-K and my son is looking to start this fall. Where I'm at, it's a joke and my kids learned nothing. They started doing some actual in school learning in kindergarten. The Pre-K was just free daycare. Which helped be daycare and allow the kids to socialize. So I guess it helps get some social education in, but there was nothing formal learned\n\nExcuse the crappy grammar and whatever, it's late and I'm tired.", "Yeah agree.  I worked summers at a public school with an extensive special needs program.  I worked with 4-5 year-olds in both integrated and special-needs-only classes -- *many* of them were in diapers.  We changed them during the day, no big deal.  That's not a reason not to be in school.  I'm a big believer that socialization at an early age is a major boon to kids with special needs.\n\nI get where you're coming from, a lot of people infantilize kids with special needs.  But there's not really a good way to criticize someone's parenting, special needs or not.", "I presume that you are aware that these groups can actually be even more disruptive for children with ASD, is they don't have the correct support or the child cannot manage this.\n\nPerhaps that's why the PARENTS make the decisions, not the nosey relative who thinks because their child is deaf and potty trained knows it all?\n\nI presume that you are aware that managing toileting has no tangible link to hearing abilities? \n\nSource: mother of child with ASD and hearing issues", "Daycare/preschool have different rules than kinder+\n\nChildren with autism can qualify for IEP which may or may not allow regulations regarding bowel movements.\n\nYou can\u2019t say for sure that it won\u2019t get that kind of accommodation period because that is factually incorrect.\n\nHomeschooling is an option and depending on the needs of the child, may be a better fit.", "Because when people work and the kids are with the wives then I don\u2019t see how the children are interrupting you so much that you know what their toilet habits for 8+ hours a day.", "If your local elementary school offers these programs, there isn\u2019t, which ours does", "You sound like the woman who was my stepmother. I never attended preschool. I\u2019m a lawyer. She thought I\u2019d never amount to anything because I didn\u2019t go to preschool.", "Isn\u2019t what?\n\nA cost? A scheduling conflict with parents work schedule? A bad fit for the child? Limited spots available?"]}
