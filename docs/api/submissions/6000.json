He got mad at me for being ungrateful, saying that \"she will be able to use it by next year.\" I asked when I'll be getting a car, and he told me it will be a few months until he can afford to buy another car, and that ill just have to keep getting rides places or borrowing his if he's not using it. I just walked away from him and just went to my room.  \n My best friend agrees with me that its stupid to buy a car for someone who cant drive, but one of my other friends is saying that I'm being ungrateful towards my parents and need to loosen up.\n\ni'm still conflicted.

You're also the older sibling, another reason this seems backward.

Seems like they're holding a grudge, but why?", "NTA , she can\u2019t use it and assuming from the last few sentences it seems like that purchase will delay you getting a car. Is your sister paying for her car insurance too? And was this a car one of you parents also really wanted to that\u2019s why they bought it \u201cfor her\u201d but really for them?", "Not at fault is not at fault. Someone turned in to you / drove into the back of you at traffic lights or whatever. There was probably nothing you could have done.

Something isn\u2019t adding up. Where has this $300/month been going? You should just save that and buy yourself a car. Paying yearly or semi yearly also saves a lot for insurance", "INFO: How did you get into an accident?", "NTA. Beyond the obvious reasons of you being older, the only one with an actual license etc. \n\nWho buys a Jeep? Much less a used one? They are notorious trouble vehicles that are money sinks. Go ask r/justrolledintotheshop", "Nta....did u ask if you could at least drive the jeep....its better to be driven now than to sit there for a year doing nothing....its doing more harm than good by not being driven and a waste of money.", "NTA.

I would ask to see that bill before I paid it.  I just paid my 6 month premium, and the average was $320 per car for 6 months for pretty comprehensive insurance coverage.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re the older sibling with a license and they bought your younger sister a car and she can\u2019t drive. \n\nMan, they are total a********es! \n\nIs there a reason they won\u2019t buy you your car? Was the accident your fault sort of? Did you sneak the car? Did you break their trust?", "NTA for being upset, It does sound weird and that they did it this way. But, like someone else said, it is their money,  and you were never entitled to a car so be happy with whatever you get. Also, your *dream car*? Really? When I just got my driver's license, I drove around in an old ugly cheap Ford escort (paid for it myself) but i had the best time with it while it lasted, and i was never afraid for minor damage because of being a new driver, as it was already ugly and scratched here and there. \ud83d\ude97 was not my dream car, but literally the first one I came across within my shitty low price range that didn't need repairs to be able to drive. Can definitely recommend something like that for any new drivers! Good luck and stay safe, OP. Hope your shoulder recovers well.", "NAH \n\n\nYour allowed to be upset. Ultimately it's there money and they choose how to spend it.", "NTA/ESH\n\nYou should always be grateful for what you get.\n\nBut, your parents giving your sister a car and thus delaying giving you a car while you are actually able to use it is not a nice move.

They're mad at you for needing physical therapy? *WHAT?!* I mean, I get how terrible medical costs are, but that's *absolutely* no excuse for blaming you for getting injured. Your parents' attitudes here are not normal. The only context in which this would *possibly* make sense to me is if you were using their car without asking, but I didn't get that impression from what you said.
