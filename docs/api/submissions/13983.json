Dan and my son (2M) \u201cJace\u201d are very close.\n\nDue to circumstances I won\u2019t get into, my engagement failed and I had to move back in with my family. I was pregnant at the time, so Jace has never not lived with Dan or my parents. We\u2019re a very \u201cit takes a village\u201d family, so my family has helped me a lot just like I helped a lot with Dan. Dan seems to think, however, that means he can just make up rules for Jace and not tell me, then get after Jace when it\u2019s not done. That all leads us to yesterday morning.\n\nJace had a really rough night and had trouble sleeping. His stomach hurt, he was whiny, had a slight fever, etc, so I sat up with him until I could get him to go to sleep. At 4 am. Dan wakes up at 6 to get ready for school. Normally Jace is up by then to say goodbye and \u201chelp\u201d Dan get ready, but he didn\u2019t yesterday.\n\nDan didn\u2019t say anything to me then, but came home after school and offered to watch him while I took a phone call. I was in the home office taking a call for work but I had to put it on hold to see what was going on because Jace was crying and saying he was sorry and Dan was raising his voice and saying he should have gotten up, he knows the rules, etc. He even told Jace he wasn\u2019t allowed to have his special nighttime toy because he didn\u2019t get up. After finding out what it was about, I took Jace to the office with me.\n\nAt dinner I told my parents what happened and let them know that I wasn\u2019t going to have Dan watch Jace for awhile. He waited until he knew I went to take a call to start berating Jace basically over being sick. Dan said he didn\u2019t know Jace wasn\u2019t feeling well and I should have told him. I told him that it didn\u2019t matter if Jace was sick or not. He\u2019s 2. A 2 year old doesn\u2019t deserve to be screamed at and be told that their special security item for bed is going to be taken away for not waking up 3 hours before they have to.\n\nDan thinks I\u2019m a huge AH and my parents understand why I\u2019m upset, but think that not allowing Dan to watch Jace unless someone else is with him is going to hurt their relationship. I don\u2019t want that because they\u2019re so close, but Jace was inconsolable for hours after Dan was screaming at him so I feel like I don\u2019t have a choice.

Id be pissed too. no one gets to make rules for my kids except me and their father.", "nta\n\nDan isnt close to Jayce, Dan is on a power trip. jesus christ. if this was my kid i wouldnt leave him alone with Dan under any circumstances.\n\nif anyone is going to hurt the relationship then its Dan with his weird controlling behavior.", "NTA. That seems like odd behaviour from someone Dan's age to me. Is everything okay with him? Maybe I'm overthinking things, but his behaviour just seems strange.\n\nEither way, it's unacceptable of him to treat a 2 year old child like that. I do realise that teenagers will sometimes just do dumb things, but getting upset and attempting to punish a 2 year old for not waking up and saying goodbye to him is just bizarre.\n\nYou need to sit him down and explain to him why that behaviour can not be tolerated.", "NTA.  Dan acted very inappropriately, and it is your job as Jace's parent to protect him from that kind of treatment.  The fact that Dan has not apologized or shown any contrition, but instead thinks you're being a \"huge AH\" only reinforces that you are making the right decision.", "NTA. Dan is being an entitled jerk to your 2 year old and your parents are enabling it by still letting him watch Jace by himself. No, that should not be happening. And once Dan started all those \"rules\" for Jace to follow it should have been shut down. A 16 year old doesn't get to make rules for his 2 year old nephew. Mom makes the rules for her child. Tell your parents to back off, they are worried about the relationship between the boys? Well, they need to work with their son in not being an AH to their grandson before there is any more of a relationship", "NTA,\n\nJace is not Dan's assistent. Jace is abusing his power/position. It is not okay how he treats Jace.", "NTA...You're the parent, your brother is not.  Dan has shown that he doesn't make good judgements and cannot be trusted with your child.  Your child's health and safety is far more important than anything that might \"hurt their relationship.\"\n\nEdit: typos.", "NTA\n\nYour brother has himself a lot of growing to do.\n\nHe also sounds toxic to me. Although your brother is still quite young he should have basic understanding on not berating a 2 year old like that. I don't know if it's power/mind games or your brother being extremely immature but I would not leave my 2 year old with such a person. \n\nYou are the parent. You make the rules. End of story. \n\nYou should make that very clear to your brother. I would be less afraid of their relationship being damaged than about your son being affected by such BS rules in the long term.", "NTA Dan has already hurt their relationship.", "NTA.

This is abuse!", ">my parents understand why I\u2019m upset, but think that not allowing Dan to watch Jace unless someone else is with him is going to hurt their relationship. \n\nUh, no, allowing his uncle to scream in his face is going to hurt their relationship. NTA and don't give an inch.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even like it when my wife raises her voice with my kids. I for sure as fuck am not gonna have a 16 year old kid doing it.", "NTA - their relationship has been affected already by Dan's power tripping and abusive behavior. Which he won't apologize for. He very clearly should not be responsible for the well being of any children right now.", "Definitely NTA. It's *your* child, and *you* get the final say in everything considering *your* child. Everyone else should keep their opinions to themselves.", "You are absolutely NTA.  Your son's wellbeing comes first and it sounds as though your brother is not yet mature enough to know that his behaviour is negatively impacting your son.  It sounds like you have good relationships within the family so maybe a family discussion to help Dan to understand the impact of his behaviour and to set some boundaries  around what he can and can't do?", "op=NTA\n\nDan may still be learning how to be a good babysitter, but he has to be open to learning. \n\nAnd NO it is never appropriate to yell at a 2 yr old for not waking up, esp. just to tell Dan \"goodbye\".  What idiocy.  \n\nYou need to go over rules.  How you expect discipline to be handled etc. and Yes,  he would only get supervised \"babysitting\" until he can follow YOUR rules.  Ultimately you are Jace's Mother and these are the things you decide.  \n\nHowever, in your parents home, if they won't properly support you, you may have to change your circumstances.", "NTA hurt their relationship?  The yelling will.  Yelling loudly is emotional abuse", "NTA: Your child, your choice. It\u2019s not Dans place to punish/tell your child how to act. You asked him to watch him while you stepped out momentarily and he seemed to use the time to go on a power trip. Dan needs to learn boundaries and how to treat a child before he expects to be trusted again.", "NTA. It seems that Dan overstepped his boundaries as an uncle by enforcing rules for Jace without your knowledge or approval. His use of a punitive approach towards Jace, especially when he was ill and had trouble sleeping, is not an appropriate way to discipline a young child. It's understandable that you don't want to compromise Jace's wellbeing by allowing Dan to watch him alone for a while. It's good to hear that your parents are supportive of your decision, indicating that it's a reasonable response to the situation. It's important to communicate with Dan about what's expected of him when it comes to Jace's care and wellbeing, so that he understands and respects your boundaries in the future.", "NTA - You need to consider getting yourself and your son out of your parents' home. The way your brother acted was totally inappropriate bordering on abusive. The fact that your parents are more concerned with what will happen if Dan can't spend time with your son than what will happen if he does is very alarming.", "NTA\n\nDan sounds toxic to your TWO YEAR OLD. This is ridiculous.", "NTA. You need to protect your child. Your brother is being a bully.", "NTA\n\nAs the parent Jace is your responsibility and not Dan's.    Dan does not get to decide whether or not to punish a child that is not his.   Even with \"it takes a family\", that does not extend to screaming and threatening to take away a toddler's transitional object.\n\n\n\nDan definitely owes Jace an apology.   It's a good lesson for a child to learn from a young age that adults can make mistakes, overreact, and are able to own up to those mistakes.", "NTA what the hell. Don't leave your son alone with Dan anymore. End of story. Waiting until you are busy to have a private conversation to make your child cry? OP this is emotional abuse. It is not acceptable 16yo behavior. Stop it now. \n\nIt sounds like you have allowed your fam to forget that you are the mother, full stop. Fix that now. Nobody disciplines but you, period. There will be nothing that is a secret to you and YOUR authority to make decisions for your son comes first. Anyone else should be ASKING you for permission/approval. Nobody decides what your child should/has to do. As for helping Dan in the morning? Uhhh, nobody \"makes\" your child do anything except what you decide. He's TWO for God's sake. He shouldn't be made to do that. \n\nAre you watching Dan that he isn't doing anything physically to your child? Everyone is always so sure that \"(family member) would never do that\" until they do. \n\nYour parents reaction-- that is WEIRD. If anyone is harming Dan & son's relationship, it's Dan! He is choosing to make these weird and harmful choices to manipulate and bully your 2 yo child and sneak around undermining your authority and calling it a \"relationship.\"  Instead of seeing that Dan is acting bizarrely, and telling him what he can/can't do with a baby and giving him consequences, it sounds like your parents are more concerned with placating Dan. \n\nThis is another major red flag. I know you don't want to think this-- nobody ever expects it. But this is already emotional abuse. What's next? Imagine what if Dan went too far and touched your child sexually or physically struck him? Then what would your parents do? This smacks of a setup for more unacceptable behavior on Dan's part to be excused away because \"but faaamily.\"  \n\nI'd start paying for day care. Because even if this is only the level of mistreatment that you reported here, this is a situation you have put your child in that is allowing him to be harmed and grandparents to excuse the harm instead of fully agreeing with protecting your child. What would you think if a babysitter was doing the things Dan does? You'd fire them, I hope. So make new arrangements. \n\nNTA but your parents and Dan sure are. You would be if you didn't put your foot down hard and create actual boundaries that you stick to. Protect your son before something worse happens.", "NTA - your primary responsibility as a parent is to your child.  You are protecting your child from an older child who is being unreasonable and mean.  I think you need to have a very clear conversation with your brother (and possibly your parents) that nobody gets to make up rules for your son except you.\n\nAs for your brother saying that you should have told him that Jace was sick, he should have asked where his nephew was when he didn't see him in the morning.  That street goes both ways.", "NTA you need to keep your son away from that man it\u2019s just a beginning he\u2019s going to torment and bully your son just wait", "NTA and it\u2019s weird that a 16 year old wants hang out solo with a toddler bad enough to make it into a big deal.", "I dont think you need judgment, I think you need advice from a more appropriate sub. \n\nDan and Jace likely have more of a sibling type relationship rather than a nephew/uncle one. Its not appropriate for a teenager to yell at a 2 year old like that but you cant really stop them from interacting as they do live together so I\u2019m not sure thats the solution.", "NTA.  I think your brother yelling at your son will hurt their relationship a lot more than not letting him watch your son alone.", "You have said all you need to say, your son is 2. The behavior you have described from your brother exibits absolutely zero understanding of a 2 yr old. Shame on your brother. And shame on your parents, the grandparents of your 2 yr old. Your brother needs supervision and instruction on how to care for a 2 yr old. Perhaps the grandparents need supervision and some instruction also.\n\nPlease protect your son from your immature brother. If you don't,  you will be ta.", "NTA. Dan was being abusive to your son. *Do not* leave him alone with your child, he has already proved he is not trustworthy. \n\nYelling at a child, controlling them and punishing them is emotional abuse. You shouldn\u2019t be worried about damaging their relationship, Dan is already doing that himself. Your parents are out of line, worrying that Dan is going to be hurt by this somehow rather than worrying g about the damage Dan is doing to your son. Your son is a teeny human who relies on your for everything in their life. Dan is a teen who should know better. Honestly Dan should be punished for abusing your child and it kinda sounds like he needs therapy cus he\u2019s got some harmful controlling tendencies, is cruel, and angry.", "NTA regardless of how close they are, Dan never should have yelled or verbally assaulted your son; he isn't your son's parent & shouldn't be enforcing his own set of rules that you did not tell him to enforce. Your son has a right to feel safe & honestly, I don't think your son would feel safe alone with Dan immediately after being berated for something that was never expected by you, his mother, to begin with. It's nice they have a bond but bonds can be severed for the sake of your child's physical & emotional safety.", "NTA.\nDan is a massive AH. Who tf yells at a 2 year old for not waking up?! This is not a small thing. This is a massive overstep and honestly it sounds abusive. You made the right call.\nDo NOT leave your son with your brother!!", "NTA. Jace thinks he is far more mature than he is. I can see he might think he is acting as a father-figure or uncle to Dan so he probably deserves a small amount of grace for making a mistake. But his ideas of parenting, discipline, and the abilities of a two-year-old are completely screwed up. \n\n16 is an age where you do a lot of growing up quickly, and it seems like this is what he thinks it means to act like an adult. So I\u2019d suggest having an open mind to teach Jace rather than pushing him away. Everyone would be a winner.", "NTA. But. I think taking him away from all babysitting isn\u2019t helpful.

Unless you son was about to get into something dangerous and yelling to get your sons attention quickly he has no right to yell at your son!! It\u2019s not his place!!

Maybe the question is what\u2019s going on in his world? Isolating your son after a single incident sounds like overkill. He\u2019s only 16. He\u2019s in his way to adulthood, but still has a long way to go.\n\nI encourage you to sit down with Dan and sort this out.

Making up arbitrary rules? When he has no actual authority to do so? With an extremely emotionally vulnerable victim? Dishing out cruel punishment he once again has no authority to do? Refusing to take accountability?\n\nI would honestly be concerned for his future relationships. Of any kind. If he\u2019s not remorseful about emotionally hurting a toddler he lives with, I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll be much more scrupulous with anyone else.", "No I was thinking it also. Especially because his reaction when Jace wasn\u2019t up in the morning to help him get ready", "Yeah, please check over your son and/or bring him to therapy. By check over, I mean make sure that he doesn\u2019t have any bruises or marks. I\u2019m not saying that Dan has hit your son, but seeing that he got that angry over such a small thing, I would just make sure. \n\nAlso, NEVER let him be alone with your child again!! I hope he\u2019s punished somehow. He\u2019s on a crazy power trip. That\u2019s not even his kid!! He just wants power over someone, so he took it out on your kid. Also, watch for the signs:\n\n\nDoes your son flinch near Dan when he gets upset? Even the slightest tremble can mean something serious. \n\nDoes Dan often look for reasons to enforce rules on him? Food rules, wake up times, etc? This proves that he is looking for ways to control your son.\n\nDoes your son ever try to not be near Dan? Not wanting him to watch him, leaving the room when he comes in, etc? This could mean that Dan has been extremely unpleasant towards him and maybe even abusive. \n\nI know it\u2019s not likely for these signs to be recognizable due to your sons young age, but please. Try to see if you can recognize them. It could be the difference between your son living in an undetected abusive relationship with his Uncle or not.", "NTA. Dan has proven that his judgment is at best questionable and at worst abusive. Until he gets some info on proper child care, I would assume he's not a safe solo caregiver. It is your responsibility to see that your son is cared for well and appropriately, and it's obvious that while Dan seems fine some of the time, you had NO reason to \"expect\" what he did (or tried to do) behind your back, and you likely won't have reason to expect the next time it happens, either. He's a sixteen-year-old who doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to raising and caregiving a small child; there's nothing shameful in that and nothing wrong with acknowledging it.", "NTA. Dan sounds like he has some sociopathic tendencies. I'd be moving my son out of that village, because this kid could do real damage to your son if left alone with him.", "NTA, Your brother is and your parents are too for not being 100% on your side. Dan is old enough to know not to berate a 2 year old.", "Tell your brother unless he changes his behavior and attitude towards your son he is off limits.

That's fucked up in itself.", "NTA", " From the comments, I have to wondering Dan has been verbally abusive, before.  He is not an adult, not a father, and not mature enough to even babysit. \n\nNTA", "NTA , but.... Special nighttime toy? Mmmm please ask your son what toy is that. Please.", "NTA. Protect your son. Your brother sounds abusive and treating a child like that can be damaging in the long run. Who knows how long that\u2019s been going on.

I wouldn\u2019t leave my child with him either.", "NTA- anyone that did this kid of thing to my kids would be out of our lives.. but I think you should move out and keep your kid away from your brother.

This is not normal. \nHe deliberatly hid what he wat he was doing.", "Your brother waited until he thought you couldn\u2019t hear him to yell at your son.

What else would he be willing to do.\nI\u2019m sure you love your brother. But his behavior makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I feel really concerned about your sons safety with him.", "Honestly, this was my first thought too, but I thought maybe I was being overly paranoid. Glad to see someone else reaffirm that. That is not normal behavior at all.", "I just posted the same. Sounds like he has sociopathic tendencies tbh. I would be moving out asap."]}
