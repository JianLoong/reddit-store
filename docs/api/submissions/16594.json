It kind of seems like the only AH here is your Dad for getting mad at you. The rest is all really human behaviour. It's normal to want moments of normalcy - it's also normal for grief to rush in and overwhelm you in a big way.

Because to my minimal knowledge, people can be VERY particular about things regarding luck. There's a lot that can go on with ensuring the marriage happens on an auspicious day and so on.\n\n\nYou also said you were crying uncontrollably. Did you disrupt the entire wedding or did only your dad notice, escort you out, then everyone found out?", "NTA - if she didn't want you there, she'd have told you not to come. Don't let your Mom's nonsense guilt you into anything", "NTA. You are processing grief the best way you can. It was important for you to attend your sister's wedding. Nobody has any control over when they will break down. You are doing good.", "I'm so sorry everyone is giving you a hard time right now. It really isn't fair of them, please make sure to take some time for you. You are still healing. \n\nNta", "NTA but you probably shouldn't have attended the wedding in the first place, really.", "NAH. I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your boyfriend. It's understandable that you are still grieving and struggling to cope with the loss. \n\nRegarding attending your sister's wedding, it sounds like you had good intentions to be there for her despite your grief. However, it's also understandable that emotions can be unpredictable, and you may not have been fully prepared for the wedding given that it's only been two months since your loss. \n\nIt's difficult to say whether or not you were the asshole in this situation. On the one hand, you wanted to be there for your sister and show your support. On the other hand, your emotions got the best of you, and it may have been better for you to wait until you were more emotionally stable before attending a celebratory event like a wedding. \n\nIt's important to remember that everyone grieves differently, and there's no right or wrong way to do it. It's also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own emotional wellbeing. If attending the wedding was too much for you at this time, then it's okay to acknowledge that and take some time to heal before attending similar events in the future. \n\nUltimately, it's up to you to decide whether or not you feel you were in the wrong for attending the wedding. If you feel like you made a mistake and wish you had waited, then it may be worth apologizing to your sister and your family for any inconvenience or discomfort you caused. But if you feel like you did what you could given the circumstances, then it's okay to forgive yourself and focus on moving forward in your grief journey.", "NTA but maybe wasn't the right time for you to attend a wedding. You are allowed to grieve give yourself the time to do so", " I'm not Chinese you so I don't understand the cultural ramifications.\nFrom my point of view you did nothing wrong. Everybody grieves in their own way and their own time, there is no right or wrong way. Wanting to move on, back to normal, is perfectly alright. It's unfortunate that you got overwhelmed at the wedding but it sounds like you all handled it well in the moment and your sister seems understanding. Her wedding wasn't completely ruined because of one incident.\nAnd I think that you can be around your sister if you want to and she wants to.\nNTA and your parents, though they probably mean well, are, for putting tradition before your well-being.", "NTA. \nI'm extremely sorry for your loss. \nA lot of big, serious and hazardous things could happen on your sister's \"big day\". The world doesn't revolve around her lol. I'm surprised at the behavior your parents have. You should've left the wedding instead of putting up with their toxicity. We know you attended for her sake and it didn't end well. Next time anything serious happens with your mom/dad/sister just say you can't be near them it was bad luck if you stayed beside them. \n\n>he scolded me for coming even though i'm not fully recovered and said it was bad omen for me to be crying over something and ruining my sister's wedding\n\n>she chided me and told me it was selfish of me to attend for my sake when the big day was supposed to be about her.\n\nI'm disgusted by this.

This would of been truly tough for you to attend, but you did well Op. If you were my sister I'd be happy you were there , because I would know it would of  been a huge you to do xx take care op.", "she reassured me that it was okay and told me to take care of myself. i haven't been talking to my parents since they scolded me though. they were raised differently so i sort of understand them...", "he had an epileptic seizure in his sleep and was only found by his mother in the morning. it comforts me to know he went to sleep and woke up in paradise.", ">Info: I don't know if I'm asking this in the correct terms but does your sister or her SO follow/believe in the same cultural/religious traditions your parents do?

You will never fully recover from this. The hole that this loss leaves in your soul is permanent. But by being honest with yourself and adopting healthy coping behaviors you will be able to surround yourself with the right people and even love again.\n\nAnd that is what your boyfriend would have wanted for someone he loved. It will take time but you will get there.", "I mean yeah they were raised differently. I can't fathom seeing their child in pain and scolding them for it though.", "that was beautiful. i kinda like that idea. perhaps i will seek a counselor. thank you.", "YTA.\n\nIt's one thing to be sad about a song that brings back memories about better times. It's quite another to make a scene during what's supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime celebratory event. You're old enough to navigate that situation with a bit of maturity.", "NTA for attending, especially since it seems your sister doesn\u2019t hold those beliefs that said no grieving people should attend. HOWEVER, you score some AH points for making a scene which caused dad to miss parts of the wedding, bride to need to comfort you at her own wedding, and in general interrupting the festivities. When you felt upset- which is normal!- the appropriate thing would have been to remove yourself to a quieter spot to get your feelings back under control. That\u2019s your only misstep here.", "YTA , you need to process grief, not act like everything is fine when it isn't. They were right, putting yourself in an emotional situation wasnt a good idea. Just, not because of those outdated traditions", "NTA", "As an Asian, I do think your family was right and you should not have attended the wedding. there is no bad luck or anything but\n\nthere is a reason we have this rule in place to not celebrate anything for 100 days or maybe for a year so we can grieve properly\n\nbut ofc you do you NTA", "NTA for going for the wedding. But did you ruin a special moment at your sisters wedding by crying uncontrollably? Was it during the couples dance? Or something of the sort? Or was it just a song that people were dancing to? If you cried uncontrollably during the couples dance that took attention away, kinda of an AH move. You should have excused yourself or just walked out. But otherwise, NTA at all", "Nta", "they were playing a video montage of the bride (my sister) growing up", "If people on your table and around you noticed then others will hear about it. I don't think they didn't talk with others what happend.\n\nI'm not going to call you an A H - I just think that you need to talk to a mental health professional to learn some tools to know what to do in certain situations. \n\nIt's great and good that you're trying to be around people again - you felt something when the song played and this should've been your sign to go outside for a bit and try to calm down. \n\nAnd I'm really sorry for your loss.", "NTA and some of these outdated traditions need to be changed", "YTA. Simply because you sobbed uncontrollably at the wedding instead of doing so in private. Grief is an awful thing. I am truly sorry for your loss but you cannot put that loss on others, especially on what should have been one of the happiest days of your siblings life. You stole focus, unintentionally, but did all the same. It is natural you want to move on with your life, but do not pick a wedding as your trial period. They are emotional events.\n\nAlso just because you are not a traditionalist, you should respect other people\u2019s traditions. Don\u2019t undermine them. However, they should not force traditions on you either.", "This isn't clear cut to be honest. \n\nOn one hand -  NTA because your trying to deal with your grief in your own way and trying to be around loved ones and make happy memories. You couldn't have predicted that song would have come on. Yes you could have taken yourself out of the room when the song came on but you were emotional. \n\nBut on the other hand  YTA because according to your culture, you have passed your bad luck onto your sister. You've caused a scene with emotion at what is meant to be a happy time. You've not really dealt with your grief before attending. \n\nAt the end of the day if your sister was okay with you being there and she's not mad at you for the emotion. Leave your parents to deal with their own bullshit.", "NTA from my cultural perspective. I don\u2019t have any baggage about people being bad luck or feel someone crying at a wedding is a bad omen.\n\nIf your sister invited you to her wedding then you were fine to go. Maybe you should have stepped out or left when it became too much so you did not draw attention but you are not an asshole for having emotions or wanting to try to do normal things with family.\n\nYour parent\u2019s traditions and ideas about grief don\u2019t seem very healthy or kind.", "NTA - You did not ruin the wedding.", "Honey, five years from now, you may hear a certain song and still burst into tears. Grief is a strange thing. Losses this big leave holes that nothing really repairs. Just because time lessens that pain doesn't mean there won't be times your emotions will be triggered. I have to say NTA, here. I know you never expected for what to happen to happen. And, like I said, you could've been \"healed\" years ago, and the same thing could've happened.", "Best of luck opie, if you can find time to read the ball in the box analogy it really helped me: https://psychcentral.com/blog/coping-with-grief-ball-and-box-analogy\n\nGrief can be ever present, but it doesn't have to be all controlling and you deserve catharsis and time love \u2764\ufe0f"]}
