Finally we decided to take him too, we would feel really bad to left him here, however we would just be away for like 4-5 days, our grandma would look after him at this time...\nThe problem starts where i saw him drawing they nazi logo on his hand (sorry English is not my native language and i don't know how to say that in English). I told him not to do that (we are hungarian so the holocaust was painful for us too) because its not funny or he won't look cooler if he do this. Eventually i told him look more into this. Looks like the history book did not convinced him that nazis are not good. And i told him i wont speak to him if he continue this bs.\nFor like a month i did him doing this, but now i noticed he started to do it again and even changed his phone bg to Viktor Orban, who is just another AH. Told him its him funny and cool and just started not to talk or respond to him again (im half gypsy, we dont have the same father. Im not sensitive at all, but he dont understand or just dont want to know that they killed my kind too.)....\nI told my mother about this she said he probably dont even know what he is doing, and i responded \"Yeah thats why he should not do it. He would get us in trouble in Poland of he continue to do this.\". So she really thought about that we should cancel his accommodation. I know its really harsh, but ge is really disrespectful to my mother too sometimes and acts like an incel or an Andrew Tate fan. Dont get me wrong, i love my brother, but his actions shows that he is not grown enough to attend in Auschwitz or even in Poland.\n\nSo WIBTA if i really convince my mother not to take him with us?", "created_utc": 1668255068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt5cb2/wibta_if_i_convince_my_mother_not_to_take_my/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let him go to Poland, see what happened. Maybe even fake report him or something, teach him about the consequences is his behaviour. I know it sounds extreme lol, but I feel like you don't want those views to get stronger. Therapy can even help. Looking into where they come from could be important", "NTA but he should be taken to Auschwitz. It's a harrowing experience, but he is old enough and he needs to learn. Hopefully it will help him to grow up a bit - he's also young enough that you can challenge these beliefs out of him.", "Maybe instead of icing him out you (or probably your mother) should have an honest conversation with him about WWII. Explain to him what happened, who the Nazis were and what they would do to you, your brother, and the rest of your family if you were alive during WWII.", "Yta if you convince your mom not to take him. \n\nHe needs to see the realities of what a nazi really meant. \n\nBut you wanting him to stay home because he is a 12 yr old child being an ah on a subject he fully doesnt understand is also ah. \n\nAlso, your mother is his parent and seems to he failing which is 2hy you feel the need to step in and parent him ....  you need to stop and let him and her deal with natural and logical consequences of his actions", "Light YTA, good intentions from you but this would actually be good from him. Let him see the hurt straight up in his face, don't sugar coat it and your parents are gigantic AHs for letting him behave this way. I guess you could also call this an esh, but he's clearly being brainwashed and neglected so I'm not gonna blame him to heavily as long as the adults in his life stamp this out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He shouldn't be going, and she needs to come down hard enough on this behavior that he understands it is wrong.", "Yeah agreed. \n\nWhile children can have empathy issues since their brains aren\u2019t done developing yet a 12yo should be able to understand that nazis did some incredibly fucked up things, and to understand that a lot of people died because of them. \n\nHe should only be left behind from an Auschwitz trip if he\u2019d be a nuisance to other people. They don\u2019t deserve to be disturbed while in the sort of emotional state you end up having in that place. But otherwise he\u2019d very much deserve someone figuratively smacking him down if he\u2019s disrespectful. \n\nHe needs to learn that being edgy doesn\u2019t make you cool, just an arsehole.", "That was my thought too, maybe actually going to Auschwitz & seeing & learning more about what the Nazis did will have a greater impact on him than just reading about it in a history book & being told by his sister it\u2019s wrong. \n\nAlso, maybe make him sit down & read the Diary of Anne Frank & then watch the movie. Reading about the experiences of an actual person is completely different than reading a generalization in a text book.", "We only have our mother. His father is an AH. So i kinda get why he is acting like this. My mother also works a lot. However my brother is really disrespectful towards us. He is in his rebell era so i dont think taking him would solve this, im actually scared that he would make jokes and shit about what happened there when we are going through Auschwitz", "Will your mom discipline him if he does? I personally think you should take him to the holocaust museum near you and educate him before it\u2019s too late. Mom needs to get on this behavior like yesterday. At 12 he knows exactly what he is doing.", "What books has he read so far? I can recommend \"Maus\" for someone that age. If he doesn't change his thinking by the time he's read that, I'd take him to a psychiatrist."]}
