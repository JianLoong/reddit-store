We have been there for each other during every major event, including being each other's maid of honor. My cousin has always been a bit self centered and vain. She lives with the belief that she DESERVES the very best in life. She has stated multiple times that she would audition for American Idol, but she knows she would win, and she doesn't want to be famous. She also believes that every person she encounters is bound to fall in love with her. Guy or girl, she is convinced that anyone would cheat on their partner to be with her. While she sings okay and is conventionally attractive, I can't help but feel like her ego does not match reality. Despite these quirky personality traits, I have always stuck by her. \n\nI got married this past year, and Amanda told me that I owed her husband $376 for alcohol because we ran out during the reception. I paid them on the honeymoon, but I later found out my Grandma actually paid for it. Additionally, she had my Grandma with dementia write him a $500 check for \"wedding alcohol\". All in all, they profited $876 on this alone. I also found out she stole $250 from my bridesmaids during the bachelorette weekend. When I told my Dad about this, he decided to tell me the truth: Amanda and her husband had previously stolen $175,000 from my Grandma and Grandpa in 2017. They racked up her credit cards with clothes, make up, vacations, maid services, nails and even used her card to pay $6,000 in taxes. \n\nThey moved back in last year after my Grandpa passed away to \"take care of her\", but she has proudly claimed she will get the house when she dies. After my Grandpa died, she emptied out his closet in 2 weeks. They also got rid of my Grandma's furniture and redecorated her home in their personal style-on her dime.  Additionally, they wrote themselves $28,000 in checks last year. Fast forward to now, her husband has left her for another woman. She just gave birth to their third child in May, and she is opening up about how he abused her. I have a lot of empathy for this because I also left an abusive marriage in 2019. She is incredibly depressed, and she wants to be close again. I wrote her a letter stating what I would need to consider a friendship again: apologize for stealing and lying about it for years. She refuses to admit that she has ever done anything wrong and continues to gaslight me.  I fully believe she is a narcissist, as does my therapist.\n\nI keep receiving messages from family members telling me that I need to get over it and be there for her during this time. They say she is horribly depressed and I am being judgmental towards her. Am I the asshole for not getting over this without an apology?\n\nTLDR: My cousin stole $175,000 from my Grandma with dementia.

But In 2017, my dad started investigating. He built a case against her, and he sat them down and explained the theft. My Grandpa disowned her on the spot, and my grandma was heartbroken because Amanda has always been her favorite Grandchild. My dad agreed to not press charges, as long as she stayed away. In 2022, she manipulated her way back in the house. She was forgiven by my Grandpa on his deathbed, and she begged to move in to take care of my Grandma. Filing charges has definitely been brought up. My dad and uncle have had manny screaming matches about it, but then her husband left.

But yes I agree, something is going on there", "My dad put a stop to it in 2017, as soon as he found out. She was taking money from my Grandpas personal account to pay off the card so that no one would notice how bad it was. He also put a stop to it again last year, but I agree she should never have been allowed back. \n\nI do believe the abuse allegations because I\u2019ve seen him be abusive before.

My dad never told me about the 2017 incident because he didn\u2019t want to upset me and I was in another state at the time.

That said you do not owe her a friendship.  From this post it is unclear what she is looking for, is it confirmation that she is a good person? You to help her with her kids? Separately, if she is depressed a better helper would be a therapist who could help her heal.\n\nWith that in mind let me change the subject.
