No real way to know, without getting the perspective of other people who were there, or seeing it in person.", "INFO\nWere you slightly tipsy or full on hammered?", "Depends on your behavior when you were drunk. If you were just a bit loud then NTA. If you were being a drunk ass then YTA", "NTA it\u2019s a wedding, what else do you do lol Drink eat and dance", "NTA. Sounds like you were having a good time and not causing any problems. If she is so concerned about how things appear to others because of race, then somebody should let her know about the stereotype of black women being unbearable as partners that she is 100% playing into.", "Other than loudness you haven\u2019t described yourself as an AH. So it depends how accurate your description of your behaviour at the function is. You were drunk after all. \n\nIf you\u2019re like Homer recalling his antics at the party as the height of sophistication when really you\u2019re asking Maude Flanders to get the ice cubes *at the bottom*, then YTA (possibly).", "No judgment, just something your story made me think of. I have a black friend who will sometimes \u201cpolice\u201d (I know - that word - sigh) the behavior of some of our other black friends in public. I\u2019ve asked about it, and he says that it\u2019s because in his experience, black people are judged more harshly for their behavior and he feels that he\u2019s protecting himself and his other black friends by telling them to be on extra good behavior in public, especially among non-blacks. I also know some of those friends find it very annoying, and say he\u2019s just playing into the racist tropes by telling them all to behave and that the only way to really fight against racism is to have their fun anyway (these people are awesome and no one is being extreme at parties). \n\nI totally see both sides - it seems it\u2019s the balance that POC always have of keeping their own dignity vs protecting themselves from the ills of society. It\u2019s a horrid trap that nobody deserves. So, no judgment from me, but just want to express how much it sucks that your girlfriend feels she needs to be so watchful of your behavior just because you two are black, and sorry that society is so fucked that it seems a lot of black people may not feel safe just letting loose and have fun in places where everyone else can.", "OP, whether you were TA or not, depends on what you did while you were drunk, and how many people noticed it.\n\nSorry, but you aren't the best judge of that.", "YTA - You were at a social function.  It is your responsibility to not get drunk.", "Info:  Outside of being loud (which I understand I do the same when I get drunk, maybe it's a black thing lol) what other \"embarrassing' thing did you do that made her upset?", "YTA She was gone for 1 hour.  1 fucking hour.\n\nThere  choices were not:\n\n1. drink as much beer as I possibly can in 1 hour.\n2. sit down and twiddle my thumbs while everyone had a good time.\n\nThere are about 1 million other options in between.  You'll have to take the L on this one and apologize to your GF.", "NTA if you were at a similar level to the people (or less) you would be more likely to be judged by them for not getting in the spirit.\n\nI get your gf though; when you're the only person of a certain ethnicity you can feel under a microscope, which if this is the case are they truly her friends if she can't relax become of her genetics?", "This is tough. I\u2019ve been the girlfriend in this situation. My husband got wasted at several weddings, but he had a drinking problem and has since quit drinking. But it was embarrassing and horrible. He was also blackout drunk. It doesn\u2019t sound like OP was that drunk, this doesn\u2019t seem like a pattern and he was matching the rest of the vibes at the party. So I\u2019m gonna say NTA but going forward the two of you should align on expectations for these situations.", "YTA Drinking at a social function is fine, but not to the point of getting drunk. Do that with your own friends.", "NTA. Imagine enjoying your life and having fun. I'm sure you work hard and have some stresses in life like all of us, nothing wrong with drinking or getting drunk in your private time, and hey we have all made asses of ourselves at times especially when drinking, anyone judging you for that is probably someone you want to avoid. If the roles were reversed everyone would be attacking you but hey that's our world in 2023.", "YTA.  Stop making excuses for drinking too much and apparently embarrassing your GF with your drunken behaviors.  Like, do you really think that was your only option as you waited for things to resume?", "Even if you don't care what other people think, you have to care about her feelings and it sounds like you embarrassed her; I agree with her you could've just made an effort to talk to others. YTA.", "She cares what others thinks due to her skin color ? Damn she hates who she is if she cares so much about other people opinion.", "YTA. Being a plus 1 can be tough for these kind of events but getting drunk in less than an hour is excessive. Assuming you\u2019re a grown adult, you should understand social protocols and should be trying to make a good impression in front of her social circle. An hour alone is not long and usually there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t excuse yourself to go on your phone or occupy yourself in some other way if socializing sober is that difficult for you.", "YTA\n\nGetting drunk and embarrassing your girl is one of the many definitions of an asshole.", "Was there some reason you couldn\u2019t get BUZZED, instead of drunk? Do you know what the difference is and how to assess where you are on that spectrum? \n\nYou can absolutely drink and relax and engage without being DRUNK. This might be the issue.", "YTA. If you\u2019re a plus one and you\u2019re left alone (for a time period as short as an hour) you talk to people and if you choose to drink, you SIP. How much and how quickly did you drink to become drunk in an hour?", "Ehhh... gunna have to go with ESH. \n\nSo I get your perspective of not trying to put on a show for people just because they're not black and you are. Disregarding race, it's inauthentic to act in any sort of way just because the people around you aren't what you are (whatever that may be). I would also prefer to drink in a corner than socialize with people I don't want to socialize with. But there needs to be a limit, here. Feel good buzz \u2260 drunk.\n\nBut I can also see your girlfriend's perspective, especially if you were acting a bit belligerently (even if it was just talking louder than usual). \n\nUltimately, it's about conduct. Disregarding race again, the drunk person at the party (especially when you don't know them) is usually obnoxious. That person standing a foot away from you yelling nonsense, thinking they're not as drunk as they actually are.\n\nYou're just coming from two different perspectives and anxieties, but I have to go with ESH and not NAH because of how you each handled it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're in *her* company who probably already judge and stereotype to begin with (not saying her actual friends involved, but their families and such.) It's already sucky being the only black/nonwhite couple, and sucks more that we gotta be \"on\" and behave a certain way to not get furthered judged. She didn't just \"leave you alone\" (at least not intentionally like you're implying there) she was a part of the wedding.\n\nYou don't have to jump jim crow around folks but at least take in consideration of your girlfriend's feelings of why she's upset. Should your behavior or what you do make look bad? Of course not. But, she's the one who will have to interact with these folks more times than you ever would. I'm just wondering if you act a certain way, or bring more attention to yourself when you get drunk (and not in a positive way)", "NTA.

The issue here is \" his voice was too loud", "That's not fair. Minorities face much harsher judgement in social situations like this on average. It's not her fault she was born in that society.", "To be fair OP said he had two drink and all he did was sit in the corner and talk to her friend.

Why do some men act like they do not have a choice, when that's absolutely what you had, and you made the wrong one. What you were supposed to do is act like an adult. \nHow is it that you are rarely inebriated, because when you get around alcohol you become helpless to your own actions?\nLastly, your nature is  self indulgent and selfish because that's what you are.\nYou ATA. Apologize and grow up.", "NTA", "NTA", ">She knew I was drunk because I was louder than I usually am.\n\nAnd in the post he said he was drunk.

Which speaks of defensiveness. \n\nAnother reason your response is foolish.", "So there were 6 of us in total. My gf and one other girl were apart of the wedding party so they couldn't drink.

It destroys my stomach for DAYS after so it's rarely something I choose to do. If I drink 2 drinks, I'm done I'm wobbly and ditsy. Everyone's body reacts differently to alcohol, especially when it's not a common consumption. So let's not judge other people's tolerances based on our own or those around us. You have absolutely no idea how often a stranger consumes alcohol, nor if there are any variables that can increase the perceived potency(prescription medication for example). Dude is nta for having 2 drinks at a wedding party where OTHER PEOPLE were drinking.", "Why don't you trust OP? Maybe the gf is controlling and gaslighting.

If the worst thing he did was talk louder than usual would you truthfully consider that getting \"too drunk\"\n\nLike yea if he's picking fights too drunk, slurring words and using profanity too drunk.

However, his story is full of holes.. He says he was inebriated from two beers. That only happens to drunks or alcoholics because they never get fully sober. He says when confronted with alcohol, what was he supposed to do, like someone had a gun to his head. He wasn't a victim. Also, professional drinkers always say they've had two beers.\n\nFor those reasons, and the fact that he is blatantly lying, I call bs.", "You know why.
