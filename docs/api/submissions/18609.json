Do you and your family have no sense of hospitality? If your son and nephew truly couldn't share a room, okay, but why did you not work harder to find other sleeping arrangements for your nephew? And if the living room was truly the only other place he could sleep, could your family REALLY not stay out of the dang room during sleeping hours for one weekend? \n\nI think all this other stuff about you and your brothers feuding is just a deflection from the fact that you totally dropped the ball as a host.", "YTA for agreeing to host someone without actually giving them somewhere to really sleep. If you didn\u2019t have the space you should have said so and your brother is right to be mad about his sons sleepless weekend.", "YTA and your son is too. Do not offer for your nephew to stay with you, when you cannot provide him with a place to sleep. You could have slept in the living room and offered your place to your nephew, because as you wrote, he got almost no sleep for the entire weekend, because your son behaved like an AH to his cousin/nephew who didn't do any shitty thing, it was his father who did it.", "If you let your son take out his frustrations with his brother on your nephew, YTA. Did your nephew do anything to deserve that treatment? You agreed to take a 17 year old for the weekend, you very much should have cleared it with everyone else in the house first, instead you let a 21 year old have a tantrum and made the kid sleep in high traffic living room because you and your son have a problem with his father?", "YTA - You brought a guest into your home and you failed to provide the most basic of accommodations - a place to sleep, and you don't seem to see that as a problem. Your half-brother/son sounds like a petulant child as well.", "YTA You offered your nephew a place to sleep. You apparently offered your nephew your son\u2019s room, without actually discussing this with him. You didn\u2019t do anything to find a solution for the problem you created. You\u2019re to blame for creating this situation.", "YTA! Imagine if your brother did this to your son.  I don't think he's mad about your son not sharing,  he's mad his son is sleep deprived because you let your son treat a guest based on his feelings.  A 21 year old, not even a kid. This is not asking a 12 to share its asking a full grown adult to treat a guest well.", "YTA you had a guest in your home and you didn't even give them a place to rest. You said your nephew didn't get any sleep all weekend because of sleep schedules and people in and out of the room,  that is no way to treat a guest. Obviously there is some animosity on your son's part which is understandable but your nephew didn't cause those issues. Heck if it were my nephew and he was my guest I would either give him my room (if single) and share with my son or at the very least give him a blow up mattress in my room where he could at least sleep.", "Yta 100%. If your son didn't want to share you should have either found your nephew somewhere else where he could actually sleep. If there's no where else you should not have agreed to let him stay the weekend. Was the goal to punish your nephew for the sins of his father?", "YTA. You agreed to let your nephew come to stay - that means you took on the responsibility of providing him somewhere to sleep. It didn\u2019t have to be your son\u2019s room, but it did have to be somewhere the poor kid could actually get some rest. If the sofa was the only available place, then you and your household should have been considerate enough to change your schedules for the weekend so your nephew could sleep. It honestly sounds to me as though you and your son are punishing the nephew for your past history with his father, which is deeply unfair.", "YTA \nWhy would you offer a room without asking your son", "YTA, it was your responsibility to work out a place for your guest to sleep.", "YTA, if you didn't have room to keep him with you then you shouldn't have agreed to take him in for the weekend, if your son previously agreed to have him share the room with him but only kicked him out once he was left there and for no reason, that was your opportunity to teach your son about sticking to his promises and make him share the room as he had agreed to. Either way, you're in the wrong here, with possibly your son being so too.", "YTA. Why did you let this kid stay over in the first place???", "Who promised your nephew the room?", "YTA and i can see why your brother doesn\u2019t like you.", "You're just crass and nasty. YTA.", "YTA and I can see why your brother didn\u2019t want to be around you. Sleep deprivation is considered torture. You basically tortured your nephew in retaliation for you brother going NC with your son. Did you not check with your son before you agreed to let your nephew stay? It was up to you to make sure the kid you agreed to let stay could have someplace to sleep, the fact that you tried nothing and think you did everything says a whole lot about you and none of it good.", "NTA - when you're hosting someone, it's up to you to come up with the sleeping arrangements that make the most sense for your family. It's not really cool for your son to take out his anger at your brother on his son, but it's also okay to just want personal space. I don't think it was appropriate for your brother to be furious because agreeing to let his son stay with you, especially given the challenges of your relationship, was very generous of you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur son did not invite the nephew, you did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
