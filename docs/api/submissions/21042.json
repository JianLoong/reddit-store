She said that I am just a stupid brat, that I don\u2019t deserve my parents, that I am just a fat child and she even said that I love my other grandma more than her and that my other grandma is just a stupid fuck(note that I never met my other grandma as she\u2019s been dead long before I was born). I didn\u2019t say anything the whole time and my parents were present and they didnt say anything either, they just listened to her. \nI would\u2019ve gotten over it but she\u2019s been fat shaming me even since I was in 3rd grade and and she\u2019s the only person whom I feel ever traumatized me.\nMy parents tell me that she is just an old woman and she is just sad and my cousin says that I should forgive her because she was drunk.\nSo, AITA for swearing to never visit her again?", "created_utc": 1688205353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nr5p9/aita_for_swearing_on_my_life_ill_never_visit_my/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your grandma being an alcoholic doesn't entitle her to being an asshole. Maybe it even makes the situation worse.", "Why would you or anyone else think you are an asshole for being emotionally abused by your grandmother and parents?

Lots of athletes use negatives to motivate.", "NTA, but you also have an opportunity to be better. It sounds like she\u2019s lonely and angry. You can choose to speak to her directly about her hurtful words and actions. You can choose to spend time with her in ways that don\u2019t involve drinking. You can also choose to write her off for the rest of your life. She has not earned your friendship. You might look back later and regret not trying. You also might not.

I got shit from my uncles ex-wife because her and my baby cousin were the only ones who went to see her in her last days...not my mom, not my brother, not my uncles, not any of my other cousins...and I had to sit and explain to my \"aunt\" that my grandma was the most vile abusive narcissistic person I've ever known. She was racist as f*** to me my whole life (Im mixed and she hated my dad with a passion)...And that maybe if she was a better person in life then she would have had more people by her side in death. But she didn't, and she died miserable and alone in the hospital. I still feel nothing for her.....DONT EVER BE ASHAMED TO STAND UP FOR YOU HUMANITY!!!

I have two relatives that struggle with drinking problems, including my father. It was a game changer when I told him to his face (sober, over lunch) that I would not spend time with him when he was drinking. Then I stuck with it. It didn\u2019t have the impact on his drinking that I hoped for, but it made dealing with him much better.  In any case, I stick by my NTA.
