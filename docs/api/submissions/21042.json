She was racist as f*** to me my whole life (Im mixed and she hated my dad with a passion)...And that maybe if she was a better person in life then she would have had more people by her side in death.

There is a more modern version of the old saying. \"Drunk words equal sober thoughts\"\n\nThere is a neurological basis for these sayings. Alcohol is a depressant. One of the first things it depresses is the areas of the brain that perform our impulse control and helps inhibit us from making poor choices.\n\nWhat comes out of a person when they're drunk depends on the person and their underlying personality.\n\nThis is part of why some drunk people are more likely to say and do stupid stuff. The part of the brain that tells them \"This is stupid\" is not functioning fully So they do stupid stuff they want to do but normally know better than to do.\n\nIn the case of mean drunks, like your grandmother, those same areas also help supply the message \"This is mean\". An inner part of them wants to be mean, but normally gets supressed. Suppression goes away and so their inner nasty comes out.\n\nThis is also one of the reasons that some people may choose not to drink. They know what inner parts of themselves are like. They do not like what they see and refuse to let it out. Or they know what could come out, and never want to know for sure.", "Yup. There's an old saying -- a drunk man's words are that sober man's thoughts.

Maybe she is jealous that you have comforts she doesn\u2019t and she is resentful, and wanted to hurt you, but it\u2019s not because of you, it\u2019s because of her. Please don\u2019t let her words become your truth.", "I think you are right too. My grandma acts like I am arrogant for being born in a loving family and having different opportunities. Her words don\u2019t affect me anymore it\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t want to take a measure which is too drastic for her actions"]}
