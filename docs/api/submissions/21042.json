There is a more modern version of the old saying. \"Drunk words equal sober thoughts\"\n\nThere is a neurological basis for these sayings. Alcohol is a depressant. One of the first things it depresses is the areas of the brain that perform our impulse control and helps inhibit us from making poor choices.\n\nWhat comes out of a person when they're drunk depends on the person and their underlying personality.\n\nThis is part of why some drunk people are more likely to say and do stupid stuff. The part of the brain that tells them \"This is stupid\" is not functioning fully So they do stupid stuff they want to do but normally know better than to do.\n\nIn the case of mean drunks, like your grandmother, those same areas also help supply the message \"This is mean\". An inner part of them wants to be mean, but normally gets supressed. Suppression goes away and so their inner nasty comes out.\n\nThis is also one of the reasons that some people may choose not to drink. They know what inner parts of themselves are like. They do not like what they see and refuse to let it out. Or they know what could come out, and never want to know for sure.", "Yup.

I\u2019m upset from afar with your family.", "The caveat here is that if the impulse being suppressed is \"wanting to hurt someone\" then what they say might be completely fabricated, or only a tiny bit of truth with a viciously interpreted twist - because they're saying whatever they think will HURT the most, regardless of whether it's actually true. Like I bet you do like your other grandma more, but it's not because you're an undutiful grandchild; it's because this one acts like a nasty shrew!

My dad moves our family a full state away when I was very young to get away from his dad.\n\nWe only ever visited him a couple of times after that move and before he passed.

I've also heard stories from my older cousins who had been around him while growing up, and know they have more that they've not told.\n\nIn the end, I'm not at all jealous that they knew him more. The few direct memories I have of him are ok. More memories likely would have meant bad memories.\n\nCoincidentally, I also never knew my other (maternal) grandfather, who passed when my mom was a teen.
