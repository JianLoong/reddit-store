Not only arrives late (without even take the time to send you a message) but also bring someone else for YOU to cook for his friend? \n\nNTA OP but that boyfriend of yours sure is a huge one.", "Wow. Do not ever marry this guy, it will be so much worse", "He has a sweet deal.  What do YOU get out of this relationship?", "So he\u2019s there for free food or sex. Lovely. He\u2019s using you.", "He took it upon himself to invite someone over to his girlfriend's house that he doesn't even live in? Without asking her permission? The thought of doing this wouldn't even cross my mind.", "Get a real man.", "Is he often late without communicating with you? That, in and of itself, is very disrespectful to you. Then he brings someone over to YOUR home with no communication? And you are the bad guy in this situation?\n\nWhy do put up with his disrespect?", "Honeymoon period's over and now you're getting the real.  This was either a \"testing boundaries\" situation or this is really him in either case, OH HELLL NO!\n\nGotta agree with the pp's OP.  You were disrespected in your own home and basically treated like a bang maid.  If I were you I'd seriously rethink this relationship or at the very least, have a CTJ with this dude and make VERY CLEAR the behavior you consider unacceptable.  OP you've got to set standards for yourself because dude felt real comfortable treating you like shit.  I think you've been teaching him to.  Time for new lessons.  #1. Don't let bad behavior slide.  Nip this ish in the bud. #2. Don't be wishy washy with expressing your boundaries.  Be firm and assertive along the lines of \"you WILL NOT talk to or treat me this way\" .  \"Treat me with respect or get the fuck out....and don't come back!\".....like that!  OP how you handle things going forward is completely on you.  Have enough self respect for yourself to walk away from dudes who act like ah's.", "it sounds like him coming over to eat is a big part of your time together... which may have something to do with his expectation for you to be the one to prepare food for him and apparently for unwanted guests as well. does he contribute to the groceries and take out you're buying? from the very limited perspective I'm getting, it sounds like he is really taking you for granted. NTA, but know your worth. this guy sounds like a freeloader in the making.", "I would not apologize to the friend. If you contact the friend, feel free to throw your boyfriend's multiple shitty behaviors right out in the open. Explain how offended you are that he would bring a good friend home under circumstances like these and put you into a terrible position. Say anything you want to say- but DO NOT APOLOGIZE.", "You're latching on to the wrong type of comments. Your bf shouldn't be coming over to *your* place late with an uninvited guest, demanding you cook more food, and getting mad at you for not being accommodating of rude sequence of events.", "Nah this must be an American thing in literally the whole of the rest of the world if a guest shows up, even someone you've never met before, you bend over backwards and treat them with respect and dignity and give them the last food in your house before you ever feed yourself. \n\nSorry but she's rude and you're rude too and you westerners have no family values. Maybe explains why you're all so atomized and depressed.", "Yah ignore that comment. You were perfectly clear. Learning a second language is soo hard. So you're already smarter than most of us. lol!", "Ignore them. It was far more understandable than some native speakers. You conveyed the issue perfectly.\n\nBtw NTA", "Ignore that comment. You aren't wrong but your boyfriend absolutely was. NTA", "You don't owe anyone your time and effort. Period. NTA!", "But that wasn't what was being discussed. It was whether or not you were TA for acting the way you did. Of course you're not to blame for not making more than what 2 people would eat. Not up for debate.", "Lol, no, you were absolutely not at fault, that's ridiculous.\n\nIt seems like your bf thinks women should fall into default _hostess_ mode when ever a man needs feeding, that's such bullshit. \n\nAsk yourself, and ask him, what would have happened in a role reversal, where you landed in on him late, with no text and an uninvited guest, would _he_ have started cooking an extra meal and been a polite host? My guess is no.\n\nYou are NTA, obviously in my opinion. It was rude and entitled of him to arrive late for a dinner date, and expect you to host a stranger with no notice, on a _work_ night. \n\nStand your ground sister.", "Well, we actually were supposed to move in together but something happened and my mom had to live at mine for a while so it didn\u2019t happened", "I would have grabbed both plates and thrown the food out the window before I get this dude or his friend eat anything I made.", "Exactly- if it\u2019s not too late to cook, he can cook for himself !!!!!!", "It was giving me BIG \n \u201c50\u2019s stereotype of the man bringing the boss home for dinner without warning his wife and she\u2019s just supposed to throw things together!\u201d\nVibes.", "Bang cook in this case..", "Yeah, I would have already eaten by then and wrapped up any leftovers (for myself, to eat later). No way am I waiting until 9:30 to eat dinner for someone who doesn't even bother to call or text to tell me they'll be late.", ">says YOU are rude for not more cooking food because HE says so??\n\nShe even said that unannounced guest could have her plate, but even *that* wasn't good enough in the boyfriend's mind.", "\u261d\ud83c\udffb\u261d\ud83c\udffb\u261d\ud83c\udffb exactly this.", "I'm betting his mom would have rattled his brains if he'd tried that trick at home. What a nerve!", "And don't ever let him move in.", "No, he usually texts about an hour in advance if he knows he's gonna be late. I guess he was too busy with talking to think of texting me.", ">I would not apologize to the friend\n\nNot *apologize* \\-- explain, as in - tell her side of the story. It is only the boyfriend you owes the friend an apology", "Don't you \"American\" this. This entitled BF comes an HOUR late without calling to explain and brings a guest? Get a grip.", "Friend make sure it doesn\u2019t happen\u2026.", "Do NOT let him move in when he is showing such disrespect to you.  If he is unable to see how wrong he was and apologize, then you would be an AH to yourself to continue this relationship.", "Do NOT let him move in because these are going to be common occurrences. He\u2019s already expecting you to do what he wants, when he wants.", "Sounds like your mom inadvertently helped you dodge a bullet.", "There are men out there that will treat you with respect.  He is not that man.", "I hope that this stops in it's tracks you are NTA he definitely is. And I hope that he stops feeling so comfortable at your space after this.", "Your mom saved you there! Do not move in with a person who thinks this is acceptable behaviour.", "Maybe don't let him move in and don't move in with him. Ever. Just my 2\u00a2", "Lucky you he brought the friend. It was your wake up call. Don't let him move in.", "Don't move in with him.", "That\u2019s a blessing! Don\u2019t move in!", "DON'T", "Take that as a sign.", "Count your blessings the move-in didn\u2019t happen!  BF\u2019s behavior, and his reaction, speak volumes about how he views you.  That is, you\u2019re there to serve, ie just cook more.", "That was a blessing in disguise", "This incident was a preview of the sort of behavior you can expect from your BF if he moves in with you.", "Your mom looking out for you, even inadvertently, even after you're grown. \n\nI'm sorry for whatever hardship befell your family that your mom had to move in with you, but I'm glad you have each other to rely on. And thankfully you got to see this guy's true nature before he moved in.", "Good, you won\u2019t have to evict him.", "\ud83d\udea9 heed that flag friend. Also note that you were nicer to him than I would have been.", "Don't let him in your place. This is how he treats you before he's even been let in.", "[removed]", "A better move would have been to give friend BF's plate, have dinner with friend (don't want to be rude, right?) and let BF fend for himself.

Cinderella vibes", "This is literally something that happens in Mad Men.", "He could read the room and then complained \u201cshe made him feel unwelcome\u201d instead of getting mad at his friend for putting him in that uncomfortable situation to begin with.\n\nDefinitely an AH just like the bf.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
