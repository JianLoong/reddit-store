All of these are shitty, but not something that would lead to a breakup from my perspective.\n\nBut the messaging her overnight calling *her* rude and blaming her - that, to me, is what pushes this over the line and I hope you wouldn't do something like that to your wife. That's not \"a mistake\", that's him being a really really shitty boyfriend. Historically, women have put up with a lot of shit from boyfriends and maybe they'll come good and be good partners after they get over themselves, but the fact that he's sending her shitty messages blaming her for not being a maid to him? Doesn't fill me with hope. \n\nWhen you were first dating your now wife would you blame her for not staying up late to cook your uninvited friend dinner? Like, I can see doing a shitty thing when you've had a few drinks, but it's the overnight blaming her for his rudeness that is going to get worse because he can't see how shitty he was being.

Turns out I'm agnostic and against organised religion.). Needless to say it didn't work out and I broke up with him after a few years of being together.

Absolutely horrible behaviour.

This absolutely demonstrates that he's a bad partner and blindly being like \"well he could improve\" is how countless women have ended up married to absolutely shitty partners. \n\nThe amount of times my friends end things after a long-term relationship with some shitty dude who does no work and she tells me about all the red flags, they're like this.
