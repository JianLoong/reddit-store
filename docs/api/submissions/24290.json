NTA", "I don't know why you're downvoted for answering that question lol. Do they think you're lying?", "Does her office have any issues with visible tattoos? Most don\u2019t, these days.", "Ok so is the issue you have with the location because she has an office job (all my piercings and tattoos haven't stopped me from having an office job in two different countries, this person is lying to themselves if they actually think large, visible tattos impact employment in 2023), or is it because you're insecure and don't like the attention it could draw?", "Is that why you have a problem with the location of the tattoo? Or is it something else? Really hard to decide whether you\u2019re TA when I don\u2019t know if you have practical concerns or are preemptively mad that someone might look at your wife\u2019s chest.", "Told my husband this when he wanted to get his neck tattooed. Told him it was his choice, but the chances of me fucking someone with a neck tattoo were very slim. We\u2019ve both got tats, he\u2019s got both sleeves, and part of his back, I\u2019ve got my wrist and half my back, so neither of us is against tattoos, but neck tats make me cringe. \n\nHe did not get the neck tattoo.", "I second this.  I am a Town employee that is customer facing (think DMV) and my husband was a letter carrier (now a post master) both respectable public servant positions. We both have highly visible, large tattoos. I even have a septum piercing and he has guages. We are adored by both our employers and the people we serve.", "I am a lawyer and I go to court. I have a visible tattoo.", "And that\u2019s great, but OP feels this will be jarring and off putting and that\u2019s fair too. I\u2019d be concerned that my partner doesn\u2019t care about my feelings.", "He did say he finds tattoos in that area unattractive in a comment to someone else on here", "I mean, if your personal preference outweighs how important you think your partner\u2019s attraction to you is, yikes.", "Should be the tagline of this *app* honestly", "How is that worse than her completely ignoring her spouse\u2019s opinion?", "I would divorce my husband if he willingly chose to make himself extremely unattractive to me and present himself publicly in a way that would reflect badly on me. \n\nIf someone doesn't care to be attractive to you and to make you proud of them, they don't care about you. That's a very good reason for divorce.", "If she loves him, she can \"deal with it\" as well and be happy with the tatts she has. It's a 2 way street.", "Wow, just because you love your partner doesn\u2019t mean you have to \u201cdeal with it\u201d. It is her body, but you can\u2019t act like this won\u2019t impact their marriage.", "But she has one on her bicep. I\u2019m assuming a 28-year-old can wear the sleeveless tops that everyone is wearing these days.", "You keep saying \"she knows this\" and it sounds like you really mean is you believe your level of attraction should be the most important piece of data she'll consider in her decision and that your preferences should dictate her choices regarding her body. Not her preferences or desires, not what she considers attractive, but just what you want and like above all else. \n\nIf that's really what you believe, why have a wife when you could have a sex doll and dress/tattoo it however you like? If you really love her, then why would you throw such a fit about one thing you find unattractive? It sounds like you don't love her as much as you claim, if you love is so shallow one unattractive tattoo will kill it.\n\nEdit to add YTA big time.", "So you believe that you will lose your attraction to your wife you claim to love so much because she put a piece of artwork on her chest?", "I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re going to have to either suck it up or divorce her.  If there was something traumatic about the tattoo or its placement, or something affecting your mental health, then you would have a strong argument. The argument being that; while your wife is entitled to her body, part of being married, is having empathy for your partner. \n\nBut since it\u2019s just a matter of personal taste, I don\u2019t think you have a leg to stand on.\n\nYTA.", "Why? Let\u2019s get to the root of why you don\u2019t like it there.", "Yep, and be an asshole for douing thar over a tatoo.", "Its the point.", "Good luck talking sense to the \"her body her choice\" brigade.", "To her it\u2019s not a mistake..", "It's nonetheless a factor to consider when making permanent changes to your body.", "An accident would not be her fault though, this is something she is choosing to do. Of course she can do what she wants, but it is fair for OP to be able to have their say, so NTA.", "\"I wouldn't have been interested in you if you had this tattoo when we met\"\n\nI don't like fake breasts I wouldn't date a woman with fake breasts. If my partner got cancer and had to get fake breasts I would be supportive ofc, but it would be challenge to for me to overcome. That's totally different than her choosing to make a permanent change to her body that her partner does not find attractive. \n\nWhat if your husband wanted to get a large penis implant that didn't quite look or feel natural? His body, his choice? Yeah cool tattoo your eyeballs black, your body, your choice.", "Even if they did have a policy, pretty much all acceptable office wear besides V necks and low swoops that show off cleavage will hide that tattoo, so it\u2019s not going to be a career killer", "But so off putting that he feels no attraction at all? That's weird to me. If you love someone you don't lose attraction with a snap of the finger. My partner would have to make a lot of very ugly beauty choices for me not to find him no longer attractive at all...", "Because, ultimately, it is still *her* body. She does not have to look a certain way just because it's what her partner prefers.", "Considering what her tattoo design is I doubt it would \u201creflect badly.\u201d If it was a face tattoo I could kinda understand his side but the area where she wants it no. And if it were a case of just not upkeep on hygiene and stuff I could see but to divorce over a small part of the body is shallow. \n\u201cI don\u2019t mind you having tattoos but just don\u2019t put that one there.\u201d That doesn\u2019t sit right for me.", "When you get tattoos you always want more. I should know I have 8 and plan on more. She has a tattoo on her side boob. I would think that would be more unattractive then the area he thinks she shouldn\u2019t get it. At this point the more I think about it they should divorce. Find someone better than him", "People on AITA seem to hold two deeply unreasonable views on marriage:\n\n1. You should be able to have 100% autonomy in all decision-making while married (sole exception: if your wife is pregnant)\n\n2. You must love and be sexually attracted to your spouse no matter what they do\n\nIn AITA land, she can get a full face tattoo of Homer Simpson and he needs to suck it up. He should still have sex with her and stay with her. But! If he decides to stop having sex with her, not because of the tattoo but just because he feels like it, she needs to respect that it's his body, his choice and she shouldn't leave him for it or seek sex elsewhere. They should stay married in their sexless Homer-face-tattoo marriage forever while continuing to love each other unconditionally, or else neither of them ever really loved the other to begin with. \n\nOr, in normal land, he could say, \"Honey it's your choice but I really really don't like that tattoo\" and she could say, \"Okay, you're the one who promised to spend a lifetime looking at my body and I want you to like what you see, so I'll get a different tattoo.\" Like most reasonable people do. \n\nPeople are acting like he is prioritizing his dislike of this tattoo over his love for her, but they should turn it around: why is she prioritizing her desire for this tattoo over her love for him? \n\nI would never get a tattoo my wife doesn't like. It would literally never occur to me. As soon as she said she doesn't like it, it would be off the table and I'd get something else. Because I love my wife and I want her to think I'm hot.", "If he wants to divorce her over a tattoo then he clearly needs help. That\u2019s a dumb reason to divorce. This is one of those things that he is just going to have to \u201cdeal with it.\u201d He is shallow", "I can\u2019t understand why a tattoo has this dramatic effect on marriage. If my partner was getting a Tattoo and we were in the position it wouldn\u2019t effect employment, I wouldn\u2019t have a problem. I can\u2019t understand being upset your partner wants to express themself with flowers and a hummingbird?", "Possibly, guess I won't know till she has it done.  But when I see chest tattoos on an otherwise attractive female its just not something I think looks good.", "You can't be this daft honestly, it's a permanent ugly tattoo that he will have to look at for the rest of their lives together. Jeez", "I don't know what the root of it all is.  I just think its ugly on the upper chest and just unattractive to me.", "There is nothing asshole about that, he can divorce her for any reason he seemed fit. \n\nRemember, nobody is entitled to a relationship.", "She\u2019s already got one on her boob so why is he ok with that one but not this one? On the boob is gonna sag faster than under the collarbone", "The way OP describes it, it would be visible in most of her clothing.", "Honestly if a woman got a tatt smack bang on her chest, I\u2019d be less attracted to them. And then wait for old age and skin sagging to kick in", "You\u2019re right, she doesn\u2019t have to. But this isn\u2019t about whether or not she can; it\u2019s whether or not she should. Doing so over your partner\u2019s objections is a pretty awful, selfish thing to do if you value them and your relationship at all.", "Guys it's a chest tattoo. Not something that is worth ending your marriage for. You guys are acting like parodies of these subs as well. I agree that she should compromise but if we are going for the nuclear option of ending a marriage over a chest tattoo. Don't you think that's a bit dramatic.", "I laughed at this because it\u2019s all true hahaha", "Your options are work through your feelings because you do love and respect her or divorce her. You don\u2019t get to impose your issues on other peoples bodies.", "Why is it ugly? He says he likes the design", "I agrer, but controlling person is a controling person", "Uhm, this one takes up way more space on her body and is more visible.", "Buddy, what do you mean, it's gonna happen anyway. \ud83d\ude02 If you love someone you don't envision future when you are both old?", "I actually think it would be dumb to divorce over it and I think the op is a big baby but meh", "I couldn\u2019t laugh at this because it\u2019s too true. AITA is often better entertainment than reality TV but people go from your every feeling is valid to how dare you voice your feelings twice real fast.", "The location of the tattoo will make it repelling to him.", "He just voiced his opinion, he did not demand her to not get it. Come on bruh, you're reaching.", "He also said there was one on her hip too which could be huge. He never specifies how big the other ones are and they can get big especially if the bicep is a sleeve. Tattoos are widely accepted everywhere unless she\u2019s getting it right on her face. Plus he said \u2018under the collarbones\u2019 which means it\u2019s not going to be visible in any sort of professional environment with suits and blouses that will cover up that area, only casual clothes like v-necks and tanks and straps but then again, he also said bicep and hip so\u2026those are also visible. \n\nPersonally, I think he just has a huge problem with it for it\u2019ll cause people to look at her boobs. \n\nIt just boils down to she can do whatever she wants. He can voice his opinions but he doesn\u2019t own her body.", "Sure, but a saggy tattoo on the boobs won\u2019t exactly make them more appealing! Why wld you want to do that to your partner if you know they\u2019ll find it a turn off?", "It is dumb to divorce over it. Op is not being a big baby. I don't see why he shouldn't try to convince her otherwise if she doesn't want to compromise. You guys are so extremely rigid on things that it seems like a parody of relationships columns. Your partner is allowed to question your actions. That is part of being in a relationship.", "That\u2019s his problem", "If someone is repelled by a tattoo because of its placement. They need to grow up", "Yep, but if he divorces over that, he is an asshoke.", "Saggy tattoo on boob? Where she wants it is right above the the boobs. She has a side boob tattoo that\u2019s going to sag and actually look unattractive", "The thing is is, he can have an opinion, but ultimately it\u2019s up to her. It\u2019s her body and she probably thinks it would look really good right there. I always think where I want to get my tattoos and if they would look good right there before I get them. I\u2019m still trying to figure out why he thinks the tattoo placement is unattractive when she has a side boob tattoo that is eventually going to sag and look horrendous. That will look unattractive. If she ends up getting it, he is just going to have to deal with it. There\u2019s always going to be some things about your partner that you might not like but your love for them and the rest of them outshine that. If he can\u2019t get over the fact that she might get a chest tattoo, then he needs to reevaluate things.", "I guess so, he probably should just divorce her.", "Even if it's a forehead tattoo? Lol", "Of course it's ultimately her choice. Doesn't mean he can't try to change her mind.", "Yes his  options are worked through it because he loves and respects her or divorce her he doesn\u2019t get to impose his issues on her", "Yeah. It\u2019s his wife\u2019s body. She gets the complete choice over it", "Like I said, he can have an opinion. But that\u2019s it if she says I\u2019m going to get it then he needs to leave it alone. Because if he keeps trying to convince her and bring it up, it\u2019s going to cause even more tension and problems. If she was cliff diving and risking her life, that would be one thing, but it\u2019s a simple tattoo. It\u2019s not a hill worth dying on.", "She doesn't seem to want to work thru it so I guess divorce is the best option for them. Win win for everybody.", "That's okeii, they're incompatible and they should both walk away."]}
