I find them disgusting, and would have been genuinely turned off. I won\u2019t have sex with someone I\u2019m not attracted to, so he deserved to know that a neck tattoo would\u2019ve been unattractive", "Get over it, it\u2019s not your place to stop her jeez how hard is that to understand edit: also if you truly loved her this wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Her physically being attractive shouldn\u2019t be the only thing that holds your attention.", "This subreddit and reddit as a whole is so fucking funny, so out of touch with the real world it\u2019s insane. I\u2019d have to guess 90% of the people commenting are teenagers with 0 relationship experience.", "lol yes I love my wife. She's amazing as is.  \n\nBut Hypothetically, if she had a chest tattoo when we first met, we would have never even gone on a first date.", "It\u2019s called *reality*. Nobody over the age of 25 (at least, mentally) looks at a tattoo and thinks it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d.\n\nAnd it\u2019s very obvious that you\u2019ve made the same dumb decision that OP\u2019s wife wants to make. That\u2019s too bad.", "Not visible ones that can\u2019t be covered, which is what OP\u2019s wife wants to get.", "Oh, you're just a troll. Got it. \n\nOn the extreme off chance you're serious, in what way did I invalidate his feelings? I stated a fact: The tattoo and his opinion of it is at the center of the argument. If he divorces her, it will be because of his opinion about the tattoo. He is within his rights to do that, but it doesn't change the very literal fact that the end of the relationship was caused by him disliking her tattoo.", "And it depends on a person\u2019s community. If someone\u2019s already established, pretty much anything goes. But in my community, a chest tattoo would be more of a disadvantage.", "Especially florals. Like??? On the scale of \u201ctrashy\u201d tattoos this doesn\u2019t even place", "That would play into his ideology, not his physical appearance. I\u2019m not attracted to nazis.", "I literally have a tattoo that is across my chest from under the collarbone all the way across. Unless I\u2019m wearing a v-neck or low cut shirt, you cannot see it. In a normal crew neck shirt, it\u2019s invisible. Maybe in a button up it would show, mine specifically because it goes a little higher on my neck. Just because it\u2019s on your chest doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s visible.", "Not sure why your getting downvoted. This has been proven multiple times, hell a month and a half ago a poster created an identical post they made a year ago, verbatim except they switched the OP out to be a man (the OG post the OP was a woman) and surprise surprise, The OG was voted N T A and the post with the man was voted Y T A with added insults as a bonus.", "I don\u2019t think so. Compromise on what\u2019s for dinner is easy. These are the hard conversations and situations that we should work through and compromise if necessary.", "That\u2019s how it sounded to me too.   \n\n\nWhere I come from (Australia) neck tattoos are a sure sign of a person with questionable lifestyle choices. Anyone dating someone with a neck tattoo knows full well they are dipping their toes into a person with (or a coming) criminal history, potential violence history etc. People who get neck tattoos here live way out side the social norms. (And yes,not all neck tattoo wearers are violently bikie thugs. Just many.)  \n\n\nIf we were talking about neck BEARD is it the same? Can a person say \u201cLook I can\u2019t sleep with you because..  neck beard!\u201d\u2026 probably. Difference is that\u2019s temporary, where tattoo is pretty permanent.", "No, sex is not about owing someone. And it should also not be used in a discussion as in \"if you do this there's no sex\"", "This is an absurd comment.", "I always enjoy it when the OP of an AITA thread comes back and tells the sub to calm down because theyve been getting told to get divorced/call the police/a lawyer/whatever over a completely trivial matter in a perfectly healthy relationship.", "okay but you said you would leave your wife, as in if she got one tomorrow you would leave", "Hmmm I\u2019m 33 and still find ink pretty cool. I have ink myself and plan on more. You can be book smart but clearly not socially smart.", "Nope, these are visible tattoos. Additionally, OP\u2019s wife wants a tattoo that can be covered - there are many professional women\u2019s clothing options that cover that cover the collarbone.", "Ah this answer makes it more clear- you don\u2019t really view people as complex individuals with their own internal needs & desires, but superficial creatures who exist only in how they interact with others. You dehumanize everyone, way better. \ud83d\ude12", "Why are you describing the wife as an object of her husband\u2019s enjoyment? Do you really not see how dehumanizing that is?", "Yet it's completely covered by any collared shirt or crew-neck. It's not like it's a tattoo up to the ears.", "That tracks with what I\u2019ve heard, but am very curious about that. Do you happen to have a link to the post or the user or something? I\u2019ve always been curious about what would happen with something like this\u2026 I guess now I have my proof \ud83d\ude02", "Your statements contradict each other.", "\u201cIf you alter your appearance in such a way I may no longer find you attractive. That being the case, we probably won\u2019t have sex/be together.\u201d\n\nWhy\u2019re you being intentionally difficult?", "Minor disagreement between people married for 20 years: divorce\n\nMinor misunderstanding between 20 year olds: you need couples therapy.\n\nIt\u2019s laughable.", "Have you ever been in a relationship longer than six months? Because it sure doesn't sound like it.\n\nAttraction waxes and wanes. It's fluid, not concrete. \n\nI really hope you're a kid, because this stance in an adult is just sad.", "No YOU do. Not all of us think about what our S/O is going to think about changes to our body.", "I am married and have been for almost 20 years. Welcome to the way adult relationships actually work.", "stfu, I (f) can control my attraction enough to not be attracted to straight women and only be attracted to people who are compatible with my sexual orientation and gender identity. Stop making us look like rapists and stop objectifying OP's wife", "Relax, edgelord.", "Well hell, congrats on 20 years", "You made a choice one day to not be attracted to straight women? I\u2019m attracted to straight women and I didn\u2019t do anything it\u2019s just what I like.\n\nWhere is the objectification? She makes a choice he thinks it\u2019s ugly he\u2019s not as attracted where is the objectification?", "Yep married for 18 years and with my husband for 22. We definitely don't look the way we did at 25.", "Thanks! It's funny what you think will be a deal breaker vs how you feel about it years into being with someone"]}
