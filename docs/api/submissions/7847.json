You might look this up too - not because you have to change your ways, but if you know where she's coming from it may be easier to have conversations with her.  \n\nIf she's a hardcore believer - she's upset because she's worried about your afterlife.  Again there's no need to adopt her beliefs, but knowing where these opinions come from is always a good thing.", ":) and to be clear if you wanted to get wacky: it's your body, and your choice.  Common sense is always good;  as in will visible tattoos affect your job, and mainly do you think you'll love it when you're 50 etc \n\nSeeing that she's Muslim basically means that any tattoo is problematic for her, same in Judaism.  But again that is HER religion not yours, and like any religion there's more-less, modern-conservative schools of thought.  There are plenty of Muslims out there who've gotten tattoos just like there are a lot of Jewish people with tattoos too.  \n\nIt sounds like you are a kind sibling who cares about their sister but that doesn't mean you need to defer to her religion.", "I am far beyond half-wondering on that front.\n\nShe's trying to force OP's actions in an \"innocent\" way - where she doesn't tell them outright and instead resorts to emotional manipulation.", "Definitely helpful to get her perspective, thank you.", "I'm trying to give some benefit of the doubt, I don't know them personally so can't say for certain. It sounds overwrought though!"]}
