I would bet that's not the first time they've acted like it's the appropriate title, despite the kids' wishes.

I'm 39 now, but even 15 years ago, I couldn't imagine any scenario where I'd have given him the chance to mend that relationship.

But the reason I didn\u2019t say that you are TA is because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what you\u2019re brother is bothered about. It seems that he wants you to rubber stamp his feelings and expectations from the kids, and not have thought that he wasn\u2019t being realistic about the whole situation.  Which is ridiculous.\n\nSo if you didn\u2019t acknowledge that it\u2019s OK for him to be upset, maybe apologise for that.

I know it'd break my heart to be in your brother's position, although I'm willing to bet he messed it up by pushing his perfect stepdaddy fantasy or whatever he did to annoy the kids. I'd say the wife is likely the AH for her expectations from both your bro and her kids. Aaaaaand... four kids can be pretty good at forming a team against the adults.\n\nStill. Your brother came to his sibling looking for sympathy, and you're not the kids' advocate. They seem perfectly capable of fending for themselves and expressing their wishes.

Or did you make it sound like he was ridiculous for feeling hurt that the kids never accepted him as their dad?\n\nP.S. Mark and Jane may or may not be AHs for how they navigated family dynamics.
