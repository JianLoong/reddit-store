I would bet that's not the first time they've acted like it's the appropriate title, despite the kids' wishes.

I'm 39 now, but even 15 years ago, I couldn't imagine any scenario where I'd have given him the chance to mend that relationship.

Kids shouldn't have to live with an adult who doesn't respect their boundaries! I'll be the first person to agree that dating a parent doesn't make you a parent, give you the right to discipline their children or give them orders, *et cetera*. Hell, **marrying** a parent doesn't give you that.\n\nBut at the same time, kids don't have a right to say Mum or Dad can't have a new partner just because they don't **like** having a new person around. If there's been no violation of boundaries, no actual **reason** for the kids to have a problem with the partner, simply not wanting it to happen isn't good enough.\n\nIt's not healthy for parents or children if the parents make every single decision in life based on what the children want, sacrificing their own happiness and comfort in every part of life to avoid discomfiting the kids.
