I would bet that's not the first time they've acted like it's the appropriate title, despite the kids' wishes.

I'm 39 now, but even 15 years ago, I couldn't imagine any scenario where I'd have given him the chance to mend that relationship.

What he should do is instead of calling him dad, he could do something similar like papa, stepdad or something.\n\nThe thing is too it could also be how he is going about getting them to call him dad. See my dad has remarried. My dad will tell to call his wife, mom or stepmom, and gets upset when I don't. If ur brother is trying to force it down their throats or trying to hard for them to call him dad, it's just gonna cause more problems, and they will want to call him it less.\n\nSo I'm not if this is what ur brother is trying to do but he needs to realize that he is never gonna replace their dead dad, just because he is gone.

She definitely took care of me as in cooked for me, did my laundry etc but there was always something off. When I was 16 she trash talked my mom and my dad allowed it.\n\nThen a few years ago she said she didn\u2019t care to talk to me anymore because Jesus and Trump and abortions are the devil etc. This wasn\u2019t our first falling out, but it kind of ended things for good.\n\nShe texts me maybe 1-2 times a year to say happy birthday or something and I offer a short reply\n\nOh and some other info - my dad died almost 10 years ago, and there were other instances of her shit talking my mom and him letting her\n\nThe second situation is super different\n\nMy husband began caring for my girls the minute he met them. Never expected to be any certain thing, never treated them like anything besides his children, treats them exactly the same as the son we had together later.\n\nThe girls and our son are all siblings and they ADORE him. They have never and would never think of him or call him anything besides their brother. He\u2019s the absolute apple of their eye.\n\nThey speak to their biological dad / my ex a few times a year on video chat but he willingly gave up parental rights and my husband became their legal dad over a year ago and they\u2019re always made aware of what is going on. He\u2019s not a druggie or anything, he\u2019s super smart and successful and just kind of sucks as a human being.\n\nThey\u2019ve thought of my current husband as their \u201creal dad\u201d and called him such for many many years now, and haven\u2019t called my ex their dad for as long as I can remember. The younger one never had.\n\nMy takeaway is\u2026\n\n1. When a parent dies they become immortalized and the only way a stepparent can hope to become close with the stepchild is to honor the deceased parent and put zero expectations / pressure on the child.\n\n2. If you do something like care for a child *because* you have expectations then that isn\u2019t going to end well anyway.
