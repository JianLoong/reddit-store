I\u2019m aware the ages are weird but that\u2019s not the point of this story lol. \nMy husband works at 4 am Mon,Tues,Fri and Sat at a very well paid job. When he got this job, I told him multiple times I won\u2019t wake him up and that I had to deal with waking my mother (who was/is toxic) for work. It\u2019s a different situation with him, he\u2019s not toxic but having to wake up my mother for work and \u201chelp\u201d her every morning for 8 years beat the cake for helping my partner doing the same. Luckily, he understood but asked if I could help him for 2 weeks so he could get used to it. I sighed and agreed the 2 weeks of helping him but after that, I\u2019m not helping. \nThat 2 weeks has ended last week and since it\u2019s Monday, day 1 of me not helping, he decided to get drunk Sunday Night and pass out at 1 am Monday morning. Knowing him, he WONT wake up. I\u2019ve been awake the whole time playing my switch just minding my own business, then I hear his alarm for the past 20 mins still going. I peeked my head out of my bedroom and noticed he hasn\u2019t moved. He\u2019s still alive, obviously, just not moving from his spot. \nStill, we agreed I won\u2019t help him so I just went back into my room and played my game. At exactly 5 am, he rushed in the room getting his clothes and yelled \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me up?!\u201d I kindly told him our agreement and he quickly rushed out of the house without saying anything else. And now I feel bad I didn\u2019t wake him up. It\u2019s the same feeling I would get for not waking my mother before moving out and she would get extra angry with me, leaving a bit of PTSD kind of thing if I don\u2019t wake other people for work. But I know that with my husband, he doesn\u2019t mean to be rude when he first wakes up. \nAITA for not waking him?", "created_utc": 1667216557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi9dod/aita_for_not_wanting_to_wake_up_my_husband_for/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were his personal alarm clock for the two weeks you both agreed to.  You're not his mommy.  Even though you were awake, it was not your job to get him up.  If you continue getting him out of bed, he will never take responsibility for getting himself up.  Just don't do it.", "NTA, you are not responsible for your husband. He does not get to abdicate responsibility to you.\n\nHe knew you were no longer foung to fet him up. He knew it was a very big deal for you. He acted irresponsibly anyway.\n\nThe guilt is a hold over from gaslighting by your parent. Hopefully your husband will not try to continue this when he gets home.", "NTA. You agreed to 2 weeks. If you went beyond that, you will be waking him up every day for the rest of your marriage and he will never have any incentive to learn to wake himself up (like any other adult can do).", "ESH (but mainly him) \n\nHe is a grown man who should be to get himself up and to get drunk beforehand was stupid. He needs to be held accountable to himself. \n\n*However* the fact you were awake and next to him and didn't wake him up was kind of an AH move. It's one thing if he expects you to wake up before him to wake him up, but when you were already awake and next to him, it wouldn't have hurt to wake him up.\n\nAlso, same goes for your mother? She's a rgown up who can get herself up.", "Nta. He is a big boy. He needs to take responsibility", "NTA, and get out of this relationship before you get tied down with kids.\n\nAge is absolutely relevant to this story: maturity level between a 17 year old and a 23 year old is very different, and that's where you were when you started dating. Seems like husband has been immature the entire time, and not growing out of it, whereas you are now a mature adult. So you no longer fit together.\n\nAs per the situation itself: amongst everything else, the drinking seems very concerning. If you husband was drunk enough to pass out at 1AM and has to be at work at 4AM, he's STILL drunk when he gets up to drive to work at 3:30 (to arrive on time) or 5 (when he actually left). So he's driving to work drunk, and starting work still impaired.\n\nWould not be surprised if such behaviour gets him in legal trouble for drunk driving, results in a car accident, and/or loses him his job. \n\nYou deserve better than an emotionally abusive alcoholic. Everybody does.", "ESH, when are you going to realize you just married your mother with a penis and get your life together?", "Not only are you NTA for refusing to play out situations you have PTSD from, you\u2019re also NTA for not enabling his drinking.

Or were you only awake because you were anxious about him not getting up? \n\nAnd did you remind him the night before that the two weeks was up and he\u2019s on his own the next day?

Very petty\n\nYou're suppose to love this person but you would rather stick to a contract rather than help the person out. It wouldn't have cost you anything as you were already awake.", "YTA.

ONE. and when he says yes, i\u2019m done. i end up back asleep very fast cause i never actually woke up, ya know? but he went off as if it was my fault. he\u2019s 33 years old. his parents fucked up being his alarm clock his whole life and not teaching him how to fuckin wake up like an adult. he literally used to have me telling him 20 times over 2 hours to wake up. and i will never do that again. sorry for the novel and making this about me. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f you\u2019re NTA. he\u2019s an adult. he\u2019s gotta learn. maybe this little experience will teach him. don\u2019t be irresponsible when you have to get up and already have an issue getting yourself out of bed as it is.", "NTA it\u2019s good you didn\u2019t give in and wake him up. You were kind to agree to wake him up for two weeks considering your negative experiences. No one wants to be responsible for waking up another adult, especially bc of the trauma they might have had growing up feeling responsible for adult issues as a child. \n\nYes you could\u2019ve technically woken him up since you were awake BUT it\u2019s good you reasserted your clearly stated boundaries and did not enable him. It\u2019s important to pay attention to the discussion after he comes home. If he is understanding of your position and your boundaries that\u2019s good. Try to explain again how it\u2019s very important to your well being that you do not become routinely responsible for waking him up and encourage him to get up by himself. Also, it might lead to you resenting him if he can\u2019t do this one simple thing for u that all adults do.", ">we agreed I won\u2019t help him\n\nNTA \nIf you set a boundary or expectation you need to stick with it even if it's difficult at first", "NTA. You made a clear boundary, and you should never go back on one as it just will encourage him to disregard your boundaries going forward. \n\nHowever- did you say anything about his choices to stay up until 1am the night before his shift at 4am, drinking? A reminder that two weeks are up and he\u2019s choosing to act irresponsibly the night before his shift would have been appropriate. Not your responsibility, but appropriate. \n\nYou need to have a clear conversation with him tonight that you will not take responsibility to wake him for his obligations, not blame from him when he doesn\u2019t meet his own obligations going forward. He\u2019s an adult, he needs to act like it.", "ESH. \n\nMarriage is a partnership. When one person struggles, the other should be there to help. That being said, it\u2019s his responsibility to get himself out of bed every day. However, you listened to his alarm go off for god knows how long and didn\u2019t wake him up, for what? To teach him a lesson? Don\u2019t be petty.", "INFO: do you study or work? If you don\u2019t do any of those, or if you don\u2019t contribute to your home, YTA", "NTA. Do not feel bad. \n\n1.

Especially in the case of the bread earner.  She could have jeopardized his employment and thusly jeopardized her well being.  Yes, getting that drink on a work night was stupid.  Sitting around playing Switch to prove a point that could get him fired is also stupid.", "I mean she married a man she can't even be bothered helping for 3 weeks \n\nShe didn't have to do anything apart from give him a shake, she was already awake and he is supporting her", "Fair. Since she had said she was sure he was breathing and stuff I presumed she was physically in the room. But that didn't necessarily mean she was there when the alarm went off. I think my point still stands. She was there and aware the alarm read going off but decided to mind her own business, which for some reason involves playing the Switch but not supporting her life partner.", "I didn\u2019t say he was piss drunk or black out drunk, he was only drunk enough he was acting silly..", "Drunk enough that he didn't wake up for work"]}
