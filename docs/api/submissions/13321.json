He ditched living with his mom due to her being a horrid drunk and mentally/emotionally abusive, came here to live with his dad, also leaving behind 3 older half siblings with his mom. This was 13 years ago in 2010. We met in 2016 and started dating in 2017, engaged since 2020. When we met, I already had my daughter(now 11), whom he loves and she absolutely adores him. In 2021 we had our son. Our son being his first ever biological child, his family (dad's side) was so excited. My daughter asked if she was going to to meet her grandma (fiances mom). I didn't know what to say. So I left that answer up to him. He just said No. When our son turned 1, one of his half siblings contacted him randomly about something I don't really care to remember, and he didn't answer him right away (oldest half brother). But he did come to me and ask me, \"should I tell me mom she has a grand son?\" All I could say as a kind of answer was \" well do you plan to ever let her meet him in person?\" He said \"definitely not\" so I told him \"ok then\". \n\nAfter all the things he and his dad have told me she put him through, I don't even feel bad. I don't honestly want someone like her anywhere near my kids.

She's an abuser, not his mother. She's not in his life.\n\nWhy would you alert an abuser to the presence of a vulnerable infant that she feels entitled to know? You did the right thing in protecting your kids and it's great your fiance is on board with it. I wish you both many happy years raising your beautiful, healthy family.", "If she was abusive then NTA at all, they dont get a pass just because its been 10+ years. Thats not the way things work. If she wanted to me a grandma she should have been a proper mum first.", "NTA. That's called good parenting and protecting your children.", "NTA. Your fiance has already said he doesn't want his mom in your kid's life, so there's no point in telling her. That's just asking for trouble.", "NTA\n\nSometimes you need to leave people behind to create a better life and allow yourself to heal. If the people you leave behind include your abusive mother then so be it.\n\nMuch love to your fianc\u00e9 who sounds like he has made the decisions he had to make to ensure that your family is safe and happy.", "NTA\n\nYou or your fiance do not owe his mom anything.\n\nIt sounds like you guys have made this decision with the well-being of your children in mind, which is the right and only answer.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
