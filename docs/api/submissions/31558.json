{"id": 31558, "submission_id": "1822add", "title": "AITA for not refunding my sister's ticket after she disowned me?", "selftext": "My (36F) sister (39F) is an incredibly volatile person with anger issues. I think she probably has BPD but that's another issue.\n\nFor that reason, we've had a rocky relationship most of our lives, including going years without talking. She can be frightening to be around, and for a long time I found it easier to stay away.\n\nOver the last few years, things have been better and we've forged a bit of a relationship. Not close by any means, but it's something.\n\nFor Christmas this year, I wanted to get my mum tickets to a show that I know she'll love. I thought it would be nice to invite my sister too, as it would mean a lot to my mum for us all to do this together. I booked the three tickets and my sister transferred me the money for her ticket. It's in a different city so requires time off work, accommodation and general planning (all of which I've arranged/paid for me and mum), which is why I need to think a bit more about it. Sister lives in said city so it's not as big a deal for her.\n\nWell, last weekend my sister and I were both at my mum's house over the same few days. Out of nowhere, my sister exploded at me and spent two days screaming about what an awful person I am, how she's always hated me etc. Genuinely didn't calm down from level-10 rage over three days, and repeatedly yelled \"I have no sister!\". I promise this was unprovoked and one-sided, as it always is when she picks someone to unleash on.\n\nThis has left my mum completely distraught and just at her wit's end with my sister. She lost her husband earlier this year and really doesn't need this drama. She is my sister's main victim most of the time, and if anything I think she found it hard to see this directed at me for once.\n\nAnyway, the tickets. My view is very much that my mum and I should still go and enjoy the show. I will absolutely not tolerate my sister's presence - I have the tickets, and she will not get hers. In my view, she agreed to come and then decided not to (\"I have no sister\"). I don't see why I should be out of pocket for this - she made her decision and it has consequences.\n\nEDIT: I suppose this might be more of a WIBTA, as my sister has not actually asked me about the money or the ticket. At the moment my dilemma is do I contact her to ask how to transfer it back (she's blocked me everywhere, and I would have to then explicitly tell her she's not coming), or just leave it. I don't care about the money but I don't want to contact her. She probably assumes everything is normal and she'll come along as planned. The ticket is non-refundable and the venue won't allow resale on a single ticket.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1700749489, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1822add/aita_for_not_refunding_my_sisters_ticket_after/", "score": 997, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm going to go against the grain a bit here and say that as your sister created a problem out of nothing she can give up both attending and the money because you shouldn't have to pay either by having her ruin the event for your mother and you, or put a dent in your pocketbook because of her ridiculousness. She cut the connection between you in an extreme way and she can take the bad with the good of that. She doesn't have a sister who has to worry about handing over her ticket or whether she has wasted her money.\n\nThat said, if giving her back the money prevents more drama you can do that.

I've also had a phone call with her when one moment she thinks I'm terrible and the next I'm awesome. I wish I could remember what I did to trigger that positive change.

She is inevitably going to throw a fit about that money or the ticket, and when she unblocks you send her back the money along with the picture evidence that it\u2019s the correct amount (so she can\u2019t try to argue more money). At that point you can wash your hands of the whole issue. Since you now have an extra ticket, see if there is another family member (that won\u2019t side with sis ever) or a friend who would like to go with you and offer them the ticket. That way if your sister tries to show up at the event anyway, you can say \u201cI\u2019m sorry [sister], but you made it clear you want nothing to do with me ever again so I offered the ticket to [friend/family member] and they accepted so there is no longer a ticket for you.

I would say NTA. But like if you can mail her a check since she has you blocked on everything then that's honestly the route I would go and since you paid for the ticket and she forwarded your her payment the ticket is still technically paid for, if your mom has a friend or another family member that would like to go bring em. Or just use the seat as a coat and hand bag rack since the seat is paid for.", "NTA.  Leave it alone.  She is not well and you need to put your safety & mental health first.\n\nShe has you blocked, so do the same & leave it alone.", "See if you can resell the ticket or find a friend go join  you. I agree that you are not at fault at all and it is entirely reasonable to uninvited her. While morally you probably don't have to refund her ticket it is probably going to be less drama to send her a text saying due to her behaviour she is uninvited and she has x time e.g. 30 days to give you her bank details if she wants the cost of the ticket back. If she doesn't give you the details in time then you have done your due diligence. \n\nI would then start setting boundaries around your contact. This might mean limiting contact to phone or in public places, hanging up or leaving immediately if she becomes aggressive. You may end up deciding to put her number on mute or block for a period of time. You might want to take a break and go no contact for a period of time. \n\nIt is likely she will try to triangulate your mother and use her as a flying monkey.

What were you all doing or talking about? Was there a joke that maybe seemed harmless or a comment not directed at her but could have been interpreted that way?\n\nHer healing is going to have to come with self awareness and therapy, but your safety and understanding can come from taking a small step back here and try to think if there's anything that might trigger those responses out of her.\n\nAdditionally, do a lot more research in BPD, yes, but also NPD. They are often comorbid and the things that trigger a BPD react are different that would trigger an NPD reaction. Abandonment vs criticism. A mix of both maybe?\n\nI think you're NTA and I can tell you do, deep down, worry and care for your sister. Hi do just have to protect yourself first.\n\nIf it is indeed BPD, what your sister did was \"split.\" In the easiest way to put it, her brain perceived a risk of abandonment from you or her mom or both and lashes out to push you both away to protect itself from potential trauma (real or not). I can tell you from experience, she didn't think every word she said. When I'm splitting, one half of my brain is raving and screaming and boiling with rage to push people away while the other half is trying to stop. Trying to be rational. Trying to tell myself that I don't feel those things, that I'm safe and just scared and hurt.\n\nEven those with BPD who are unaware will still fight back and forth with those split feelings and may often feel so guilty afterwards they don't know what to do or say to fix things.\n\nI think you should, if you feel safe to, sit down with your sister and ask her what had hurt her. Even if it's a small, nothing thing to you, acknowledging a hurt you didn't realize you'd given us a first step to lessing these moments. Deep down, she needs reassurance that she isn't crazy for feeling these things. Then, you can start pushing her to get some help or at least answers for herself. Just make sure you aren't going about it in a way that makes her feel like she is broken or evil (not that I think you would).\n\nIf you aren't safe to do that, that's okay. Her mental health journey is hers to make. Whether that's with you in her life or not. Keep yourself safe but keep your arms open should she finally get the help she needs and starts taking steps to fix her broken relationships.", "https://www.postoffice.co.uk/postal-orders"]}
