Something similar happened to me while at a family friend\u2019s house. I happened to be in the basement with my brother and a kid was also there watching cartoons. He was around 8 at the time. He decided he wanted popcorn and apparently put it in the microwave while still in the plastic. Never asked an adult for help. \n\nWell, his lovely great aunt came down and started berating me for not supervising him and how dare I allow him to do something so reckless, he could have been hurt! What the hell was wrong with me?! After all, I was the *adult* present. Why wouldn\u2019t I be actively watching someone else\u2019s child nobody expected or asked me to be responsible for?", "I laughed just reading the title, knew I was in for a good time and was not disappointed with how OP described the story", "u/ConsciouNewt752 is a bot.", "Misspelling of \"knob\".", "Saving this comment to show my 3 year old daughter later.

Gentle parenting is a good thing, permissive parenting, however, is my issue. Too many parents acting like just letting their kids terrorize other people is an OK thing. Then they go and complain when someone let's their kid get hurt, or complain when their kid faces inevitable consequences of their actions. And yeah, I think they truly are little terrorists, running around and holding everyone around them hostage because they think they are entitled to anything they want because mommy and daddy let them.
