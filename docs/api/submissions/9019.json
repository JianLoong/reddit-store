Heavy crossover on the fan base and I can stand their music to a degree (they drag songs out in live recordings, but their studio albums are decent). Still, hubs has been playing them NON STOP for months (literally, every time I get in the car they're on) and I'm beginning to lose my patience for it.\n\nTruly, I have thought to myself in the past \"My life would be so much easier if I had married someone who wasn't into Phish/The Grateful Dead\" (I've said this to him because we've been together long enough that we can be honest and open about this stuff). I do love him quite a lot and he's an awesome dude, so I put up with as much of his shitty music as I can stomach before politely telling him I've hit my limit, and he (mostly) respects that because he gets that he goes super hard for certain bands at certain times and it's not enjoyable for everyone around him. \n\nBut...you should be prepared for Phish to be around for the rest of your relationship if you stay together, and make some sort of plan/agreement about it now so it doesn't drive you crazy/away from him. Communication is key, and therapy has also really helped us get better at communicating over the years (together for almost 15, married for 8).\n\nNTA.
