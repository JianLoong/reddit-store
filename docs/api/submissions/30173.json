I said that I'm not going to do that and that they should just make their own food if they're hungry. He said that I'm being selfish and called my siblings into the living room and told them to each take a piece of my sandwich. I smacked their hands away and glared at him.

Tell him to mind his own business, and nobody is stopping him from cooking", "I just want to know how he thought one sandwich would feed three kids? The math isn\u2019t mathing", "What he actually meant was, \"Make me a sandwich, woman.\" \n\nNTA", "Nta", "If it was bothering cuz so much that the others didn\u2019t get a sandwich, why didn\u2019t he make them??  Or could it be he was hoping to say he wanted one too if he managed to talk you round? NTA", "NTA.     But your cousin sure is.  You should have told him if he\u2019s so concerned about your siblings eating then he can make them food.  You should also tell your mom that it\u2019s not your job to make your siblings food and they are all old enough to make their own.  \n\nIt would be different if one of them has come in the kitchen while you were making yours and asked you to make them one but your cousin is ridiculous.", "Man, that's a seriously fucked up mentality for your cousin and mother to have. Nta, maybe next time spit all over the sandwich before you eat it. Assert even more dominance", "NTA at all. Stand your ground. At most, you could help them make a meal instead of making it for them. You're right that you live in a household full of people who are perfectly capable of feeding themselves, with the caveat that your younger sister might need supervision.", "dafaq is wrong with your cousing and mother? NTA", "Why the f*** do I read this subreddit? Every story has a reasonable party and a completely delusional party, and it's always a toss-up as to which one OP is. The ludicrousness of the mental gymnastics people go through to try and be 'right' is ridiculous. \n\nNTA", "Instead of sitting there arguing with you, why didn't your cousin go make them some lunch? \n\ndid you siblings even ask for something to eat? Do you normally feed them? \n\nYour cousin needs to mind his business, or maybe follow his own advice and do what he is preaching you should do. \n\nNTA", "Just because he is taking advantage of your mother doesn't mean that other people get to take advantage of you.\n\nHe's a beggar and is teaching panhandling to your siblings.\n\nNTA", "Why isn't your mom making lunch for the under-18 kids?\n\nNTA.", "i never believe these stupid ones", "NTA and why isn't your mother making her children food?", "I don't know but the cousin would have to go after that little display.", "NTA. Why is it acceptable for cousin to be a tyrant in your house? Why didn\u2019t he make sandos for everyone else if he\u2019s so concerned about it?", "Since you don\u2019t mention him ever asking you whether you were hungry before he made a snack for himself, I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA and tell cousin they can make food for your siblings if they want to.", "NTA. \nYour cousin is a prick.", "Tell him to make one for them if he\u2019s that pressed about it", "NTA. What kind of fucked up family to you live in? If anything your no rent paying cousin needs to cook for everyone.", "Tell your cousin, to tell your mom, to do HER job. You should\u2019ve never had to make them food in the first place smh", "NTA.\n\nI would tell cousin\" \"They know how to cook and should be able to manage it.  I don't want them to end up being some useless AH sleeping at their aunt and uncles house at 28 years of age.\"  AND SMILE.", "If cousin then mom were upset why didn't either of them go make everyone grilled cheese? You are NTA OP", "NTA for not sharing your sandwich. That said, you can't expect kids to magically be able to figure out how to cook. Why not take 10 minutes to show them? I taught my 11 year old to make grilled cheese and now he can do it on his own.", "NTA, That's your cousin trying to brow beat you into making food for everyone.", "Why is making food for your siblings YOUR responsibility? Are they disabled in some way? Unless they are, NTA. And cousin should stay in his lane. Or maybe he should cook for the family.", "NTA - Your cousin is stirring shit and trying to act like the man of the house in some patriarchal bullshit.\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for making sure your siblings eat.", "I think cousin was just lazy and wanted someone to make him a grilled cheese", "Clearly he can't manage his own life (28 and living with his aunt) so he is the best possible person to manage OP's life. /s\n\n\nI agree, he was passive aggressively trying to get OP to make HIM a sandwich he didn't know how to make, and did not react well to OP saying an 11 year old know how.", "Why didn't cousin make them food if he so incensed over the whole thing", "Eff off...hell no I'd smack something more than his hands.. what a jerkoff.\nOp NTA", "I suspect the cousin feels that as the female its her job to make food for folks. not him enable body man.", "Totally this. \n\nHe sees you as a woman and lowly menial dogsbody. \n\nYour mum is an arse for agreeing. Why didn\u2019t she make him provide food for everyone as he is the eldest.", "I guess that the cousin thinks that cooking and feeding the younger siblings is a task for a woman and maybe he just wants her to make him food, too.", "NTA, OP. Not only didn\u2019t the younger ones ask for food, they DIDN\u2019T EVEN REACT TO THE SOUNDS AND SMELLS OF SOMEONE COOKING A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH! If I was one of them I would have sniffed my way into the kitchen and said \u201cMmmmm, whatcha cookin\u2019?\u201d They must have been less than hungry. So no need to feed them anyway.", "They're homeschooled and unless it's supposed to be something for the whole family everyone normally makes their own food since they're all able-bodied and older", "11 is plenty old enough to be able to use the stove barring any developmental delays or other issues. This was a complete non issue that was just about an older male trying to demand something of his female cousin. Power play, that\u2019s all.", "Why should\u2019ve OP offered to? Just because cousin got some control freak thing going on and wanted to feel like the man in charge? \n\nThey are old enough to make it themselves and it\u2019s not like they were sitting in the kitchen hungry.", "My niece is 9, she\u2019s been making her own grilled cheese sandwiches for 2 years. \n\nDo any of them automatically make you food when they feed themselves?!\n\nAnd again- WHERE DOES THIS COUSIN GET OFF?! FOH", "Definitely, but his getting the siblings involved is a huge AH move and power play.", "And/or deeply sexist and thinks his cousin should serve everyone because she's female. Also, the mother is a real problem here too for supporting the cousin's show of dominance.", "\"THIS IS SWISS, MOTHER!\"", "He could have made about 5 of them in the time he spent arguing with OP about it", "That's what I thought too!!  If OP makes more sandwiches for the kids, then there's no reason to not make him one as well.", "He wanted a FEMALE to make food", "That's what I came here to say. If the siblings were hungry and couldn't figure out how to manage lunch on their own they were certainly welcome to ask the oldest of them for any assistance that she might provide. Beyond that it seemed like the cousin was the only one upset with the situation. I honestly doubt that the cousin didn't know how to make a sandwich, though the fact that he is unemployed and living off the good graces of his aunt might point to that. He's treating one person making themselves lunch as if it was a family sit-down dinner and she only made dinner for herself. But cheese sandwich with two pieces of bread with cheese in between and whatever additions you want to add a grilled cheese sandwich is adding butter and Heat. I would turn to the cousin and say if you are so concerned about the feeding habits of this family then you are more than welcome to cook dinner tonight for the entire family.", "He thinks he\u2019s the \u201cman of the house\u201d though he can\u2019t even support himself.", "\"Enable Body Man\" is my favorite superhero!", "Maybe I am just slow, but I didn\u2019t even notice the gender of op (I know it\u2019s dumb since she started with 21f) when I first read the post. I thought it was NTA either way.\n\nI thought that if someone is making something, it is polite to ask if someone else wants one too, but it\u2019s not mandatory and not rude to not do it, especially if they are not in the room with them.", "NTA, and thanks for the quick response. Tell your cousin to kiss off or start making lunch.", "Yes, this. My 13 year old could cook her own grilled cheese when she was 10 or 11.\n\nShe still prefers that I do it because she thinks I cook them better (and I'm more patient) but if pressed she could. These days she usually makes herself either a frozen pizza or ramen if she's hungry.", "I never said anything about offering the cousin anything, only the siblings, especially the youngest sibling, it's just polite, but maybe that's just the way i was brought up. I suspect the cousin was hoping OP would offer to make him something was what i was trying to say.", "It was all about power, agreed. He wanted to feel superior and tell his younger cousin what to do like she is a kid and not 21 years old", "Yeah this was a bully move that he didn\u2019t need to take. He\u2019s capable of making his own damn sandwiches.", "Reference made my day", "Yea but lazy and probably man doesn't know how to cook", "I can almost guarantee if the op has been a guy the cousin wouldn\u2019t have berated him repeatedly and called his siblings into the room and told them to take food off his plate\u2026 \n\nThat\u2019s some level of arseholeness.", "Found the misogynist.", "I was baking oatmeal cookies by myself from scratch since I was around 9 or 10. I was designated cookie maker for the family from then on. (My mom isn\u2019t into baking cookies. She\u2019s a cake and cobbler gal!)", "Oh and I was making baked chicken or steak and sides for dinner for me and my older brother by the time I was 12/13. OPs mom is being ridiculous for allowing this nonsense from the 28 year old cousin!", "And grilled cheese is SOOOOOOO hard to learn", "I 100% agree.  Telling them to take something of her plate?  Seriously?  That\u2019s next level assholery.  I am surprised mom took cousin\u2019s side.  I\u2019d be pissed if someone did that to my daughters.", "That's the one that really got me. He called them in and commanded them to to take her food??? And their kids and an adult told them to so I'm sure they assumed it was me for them. So extra AH for thinking he could just give her food away and causing her to have to get in to them, and AH for causing the young ones to get into trouble from sister", "Yeah, my mom taught me to bake when I was 8 and I've baked cookies on my own since then. I'm the family baker now.\n\nTried to teach my kid but she hasn't been so interested. When she is interested it's things like schnitzel or cream puffs lol. \n\nAt least she's essentially taking a home ec class this yeay."]}
