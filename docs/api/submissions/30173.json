I told him that I used to make all of them food when they were babies and toddlers (which is true) but now they're all older and know how to make their own food. He said that that's not fair since they don't know how to make a grilled cheese sandwich and I said that they all know how to use the stove and can figure it out. He said that that's not right and that I should just split my sandwich between them and make myself another one. I said that I'm not going to do that and that they should just make their own food if they're hungry. He said that I'm being selfish and called my siblings into the living room and told them to each take a piece of my sandwich. I smacked their hands away and glared at him.
