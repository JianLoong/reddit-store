It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her, but the dates clash with my wedding. She asked me to postpone the wedding so she can attend both events. I told her I can't change the date because of our non-refundable bookings and guests who have already made travel plans. My sister got upset, saying I'm being inflexible and not considering her feelings.My parents think I should try to accommodate her, but my fianc\u00e9 and friends say we shouldn't have to change our plans.

Not only would it be next to impossible to change on such short notice, you would be out a ton of time and money, as would other people who are traveling to the wedding. What she's asking is extremely selfish. Did she offer to cover all the expenses that would be involved? I'm guessing not. \n\nShe can either miss a couple days of activities and fly back for the wedding before going back to the vacation or perhaps you can setup a video feed that she can watch live.", "I find it difficult to believe that she JUST won a free trip that's taking place next month.\n\nI would bet a large sum of money that the dates for the trip are flexible and she somehow selected next month by mistake.", "NTA. Years ago before my nephew was born, my sister and her husband won an all expenses paid trip to Costa Rica whose dates landed around her due date. They were able to get the dates moved by making a few phone calls. Your sister needs to try and get the dates changed.", "NTA, Your sister is the one who has a conflicting event. She needs to work it out. It is not fair (or financially feasible) to inconvenience yourself, your fiance' ,family & friends because she won a free trip.", "NTA\n\nHer trip is only valid during the time of your wedding?  Strange.  She\u2019s the one with a conflict therefore it\u2019s her responsibility to figure it out.  Even asking you to consider changing was ballsy as hell.", "This story is so ridiculous it has to be true. NTA. Your sis just doesn't want to give up the trip to go to your wedding. She wants to put the decision on you so as to make her absence your fault and deflect family shaming onto you (successfully where your folks are concerned). She knows full well you can't just change wedding dates a month out. It would have to be a major emergency for anyone to do that willingly, and a guest's vacation doesn't count as an emergency except to that guest.\n\nI also think it's strange that this last minute prize must be used precisely on those dates, but even so, SHE has to make a choice.", "This doesn't make any sense, I'm sure your guests were all notified of the date, not sure if any had to buy plane tickets to be there, the venue has set schedules that are planned months in advance, and your sister and parents (!) want you to move it all to accommodate her? OK.\n\nIf this is true, I feel sorry for you that you have such an inconsiderate family.  Congrats on your wedding, don't change a thing.  NTA", "NTA. She can't expect you to change the date when others are affected; if it was a family dinner, sure, but others have made travel arrangements and taken time off work.", "NTA. I am sorry, but a wedding is - no matter how long it takes to plan - a party. Your sister is a guest at said party. There is no reason to move a whole party because one guest can't make it.", "NTA. It would be almost impossible to move the wedding at such short notice, and even if you could, you would almost certainly take a financial hit. It's also not fair for you to ask your guests to reschedule - they have taken time off work, made travel plans, and incurred their own costs. It's unfortunate, but your sister is the one with a choice to make, not you", "NTA. Your wedding is next month, not next year.  What she's asking is unrealistic.  Your wedding is YOUR most important event,  and the trip is hers. Don't reschedule.  People have likely booked travel, you won't get all your money back, and quite frankly she's entitled to even think you should reschedule for her.", "NTA, she can attend via zoom maybe? But she's very selfish to ask you to change the date. If she really wants to be there in person, she can give away the trip to someone deserving.", "NTA - that's a sucky situation for sure, but your sister doesn't get to guilt you into *very* expensive, last minute wedding plan changes so she can go on a free trip. If she (or your parents) can pay for the changes, maybe it would be reasonable, but even then you have every right to say no.", "\"My parents think we should try to accommodate her...\"\n\nThen your parents are just as ridiculous and entitled as she is.

I doubt her story is true.", "Zoom the wedding", "Nta.\n\nTell sister and parents.\n\nThis is a once in a lifetime event for her. Guess what it is for me as well. Why should we move the date so she doesn't miss anything. Why is it ok to make us lose money on non refundable things. Spend more to change dates. Have family and friends spend more money on changes for flights and hotels. FOR ONE PERSON? Why is her holiday more important than my wedding? Why is her choice and wants more important than all the people this inconveniences. \n\nIs she going to pay the money we lose to change dates? All of it not just the refundable? Is she or you going to pay lost wages for the guests, money for changes they have to make? Because if not its entitled behavior from all three of you to think it's ok to do this not just to us but everyone else. \n\nSo no, I will not change anything. She can make her choice. It will not be brought up again other than a yes or no if she will attend and if you as parents bring this up once more showing who you favor you can just be uninvited as this us my day and I won't let you ruin it by favoring my sister.", "Giving in to your sister will be stripping your other guests of the time and money they have put in to attend your wedding.\n\nPeople have put in PTO and paid reservations that they likely can't get back.\n\nIt's quite a slap in the face to tell them your sister's time and 'free' money is worth more.\n\nI'd refuse to rebook anything to attend the new date as I wouldn't trust it won't happen again.

Seems like both your sister and your parents don't realize what postponing means, you'll have to rebook the venue, the food, everything and deal with the fallback of the people that already spent money on tickets to come to your wedding.

You both live your best lives, be happy for each other, and you\u2019ll both have interesting memories to share with each other.", "Do people actually make such requests? First of all, the request to change wedding dates to accommodate a guest's (she's close family but still a wedding guest) vacation is absurd on the face of it. I can't believe she even made that request. Second of all, your parents saying that you should try to accommodate her is even more absurd. I'd have expected them to be the first set of people who set your sister straight, not ask you and your fiance to change dates. Do they hate you or something? If my parents said something like that, I'd ask them to join the sister on vacation instead of going to the wedding\n\neasy NTA", "NTA - wedding planning takes a lot of money and time, I\u2019ve been there. Your wedding is your special day and you\u2019ve been looking foreword to it for a long time so don\u2019t change it especially this close to your wedding day. As for your parents, they are in the wrong for asking you to change your wedding plans. Sounds like some bs favoritism and you deserve better.", "NTA.

Too many of your guests have already booked everything, as have you.", "I", "NTA\nEeddings planned that far in advance aren't flexible. You've oaid deposits, you've sent out invitations,  you've told people, you've entered into contracts..\n\nAre you being inflexible? Yes. But that's the nature of weddings.

Your sister is being selfish and unreasonable.", "If all the details are as you say, then you are NTA. Your sister is actually the one being inflexible as in theory, a wedding can also be a once in a lifetime experience. Many only marry once, or if they have had multiple weddings have one that is more grandiose than the other. Marriages are investments and costly and like you said, take ages to plan. Your sister has every right to attend the trip, but she doesn\u2019t have a right to expect you to change your big day to accommodate her. The right thing to do, in my opinion, is to seek your approval for taking the trip. If you\u2019re ok with her missing you wedding, she would give you a very generous gift or offer to celebrate your day another day in a way that allows the two of you to connect for a special occasion - E.g. offer to treat you to a nice dinner or something. That\u2019s just an idea.", "NTA\n\nwhy should you change your wedding plans to suit 1 person, even if it is your sister. You have paid money out that is not refundable.

She\u2019s the only one being inconsiderate in this situation. As many others have said, she can probably get the dates of this trip changed. \n\nBut asking you to change the date of your wedding that will affect more than just you is utterly selfish of her. \n\nLet\u2019s say you have 30 people traveling to your wedding. That\u2019s 30 people that have already spent the money on airfare/gas, rental cars, accommodations, etc. \n\nThen factor in all the money you\u2019d lose on deposits and may even have to pay for short notice cancellation!! \n\nTell her that your wedding is about *YOU*, not her.

Everyone else has booked and paid for their travel expenses to your wedding and to postpone is going to put off guests for the new dates they are going to lose money and so are you with all the non-refundable expenses from the venue, planner, catering etc.", "Nta, unless it's super important I wouldn't change the dates or make my other guests change their plans as well.

Why are they telling you that it should be ok to lose all your deposits?  You cannot change your date.  That is a fact.  There are so many plans already in place, things paid for, and not only for you.  I would sit down, write down a list of all costs you would lose, all costs that family and friends would lose, and all expenses that you would have to re put out to plan another wedding, and add your \u201ctime\u201d involved as a cost factor as well.  Tell your sister and parents that it is not about flexibility, (if you were in the early stages, that might have been possible), it is about logistics, cost, time and energy.

You have been planning this for over a year and her trip is something that just came up recently. It won't be fair for her to expect you to do this for her because your wedding is also something very special and a once in a lifetime event and what about expenses who will accommodate them plus you will be inconveniencing so many other people your guests so don't listen to her", "This is strange.  Why should you change your wedding date with all that entails to accommodate your sister? Her feelings?! She sounds entitled and selfish. What about your feelings?

Your parents should also be considered an AH for asking you to do your sister bidding. Your parents' actions are making me think that your sister is spoiled and used to getting her way.

(or there's a bus with the sister's name on it) Is it the money angle? Free trip vs wedding expenses? Let's see: money, family......, money, family. It's a tough choice when you think the world rotates on your axis.", "Or she can skip the wedding because it's just a wedding in which she is not actually a participant.", "Changing the date costs money", "Or she can skip the trip", "Happy wife  equals a happy life   Learned that the hard way !", "I find it kind of an asshole move to even enter a contest for a trip that clashes with your siblings wedding. Considering how long the date should have been set for the wedding, there is no way she entered a contest before that.\n\nJust an extra layer of selfish assholeness there.", "I won a free trip once, dates were rigid and I had to basically cancel everything I had planned and leave about one month after winning it.", "But she won't I'm sure. She's intentionally being difficult and making demands without checking to see if her own trip (that I'm sure is more recently applied for) can be shifted a week or two either forward or backward.", "It could be in correlational with an event over there like a music festival and the trip would only be valid on certain dates. Hellfest is only being held June 27-30 2024, if I won tickets for that, my trip would only be valid during that time. \n\nShe should be the one figuring everything out, not the people who have been planning their wedding for a year.", "That was the part that started screaming fake to me. As if.", "Had me in the first half, not gonna lie", "Bingo", "Why should they lose their deposits?! As well as the people who already have travel plans for the wedding?", "Because if the parents were on the side of the rational sibling it wouldn't get here. It would be \"My sister Sarah wants me to change my date!\" \"Sarah, sweetie, you know that's not possible at this point.  You're going to have to choose, which is a shame but that's life.\"  \"You're right, Mom, I'm sorry, I'm just so excited about both the trip and the wedding.\"  It's only the wacko situations that end up on AITA.", "The irrational one tends to be the favourite.", "The Pavlov loop\nThey rewarded her tantrums to shut her up and she rewarded their reward with peace. And now that's all they're used to. Lol", "Usually, the parents are just as, if not, even more irrational.", "In this case it\u2019s probably reasonable for the parents to be involved, even though they are wrong, but I\u2019m always amazed by the way the entire extended family seem to get involved in some of these situations. At least OP isn\u2019t getting texts & phone calls from the in-laws and 2nd cousins twice removed telling them they are an arsehole.", "There wouldn't be a post to make if the family were on the side of the rational sibling. This sub certainly has a selection bias to it ;)", "Because rational parents don't show up here.", "If parents were rational, there wouldn't be these posts.", "If they were on the side of the OP, they'd be less likely to post.", "The Pavlov loop\nThey rewarded her tantrums to shut her up and she rewarded their reward with peace. And now that's all they're used to. Lol", "Because it makes the story they are selling us more juicy!", "The squeaky wheel gets the grease", "Because that question is like asking why so many people are unwell at the hospital; well people don\u2019t need to go to the hospital.", "The parents that side with OP don\u2019t need to vent on Reddit", "I'd love to see a post where instead of being rational in response to the irrational one, they just started mimicking them and find out what the parents ended up doing.\n\n\ud83d\ude0e", ">He was extremely shocked when none of us made it to the rescheduled wedding\n\nOh, brother. Of course he was, only someone that clueless could have made such a bad decision to begin with!", "She won an all expense paid trip to Europe, bit that doesn't excuse her asking her brother to do the impossible.", "And it that case, she would've known well in advance that the dates clash with her sister's wedding.", "Taylor Swift?", "Lufthansa recently had one tied to an NFL game being hosted in Germany with the travel dates specific for that game. If I didn't already have something scheduled over those dates, or if it had some flexibility in it I'd have thrown in my name and had I won I would have spent some time with my friends over there, but because of the restrictions, I didn't bother. OP, you're NTA, it's ridiculous that your sister is trying to get you to reschedule something as complex as a wedding for a free trip that she won. Continue with your plans, and ignore her existence until after the wedding because regardless if she stays or goes, she's going to make it all about her...", "Doesn't everyone?", "\"I find it kind of an asshole move to even enter a contest for a trip that clashes with your siblings wedding.\"\n\nHard disagree, if my sibling won a trip like that, I would kick their ass if they didnt go on the trip. \n\nWeddings are special, but a free grand trip is a once in a lifetime event. Odd waaaay better that OP will have another wedding. \n\nSister is an ahole for demanding the date change. Asking once is okay. But sister should have accepted a simple no. OP should not be upset if sister misses the wedding.", "Excellent point!", "True, didn\u2019t even consider a festival or some other set event.  Also like that you used Hellfest as an example.  \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc", "I have lived in a family where my sister's demands were always acceptable and my protesters always unreasonable.  This wouldn't make me say fake.  I'm glad that you didn't grow up around unreasonable toxic people.", "To add on, even with a death, weddings continue. My husbands only sister was murdered in a mass shooting 3 months before our wedding, which had been in works for 2 years. We considered cancelling the wedding, but his parents insisted that we have the wedding so that we can all have some normalcy in our lives, to love and to celebrate as opposed to grieving where the whole world seemed to stop for us. She was supposed to be my bridesmaid. I wrapped a necklace around my bouquet that I was given when she died, as someone had turned her fingerprint (from when her autopsy was performed) into a charm. Sometimes even death cant stop love. \n\nOP\u2019s sister literally wants OP and  the fianc\u00e9 to halt their announcement of love to one another so she can do something she clearly finds more important.", "My had died 1 week before my brother's wedding and we still had it.", "Or in the hospital with major injuries.", "Yes the trip is. But for OP tge wedding is once in a lifetime as well. And I agree just moss it. Expecting op to lose money and inconvenience everyone else for one person is stupid", "even if all of the guests are magically available the next weekend, I don't know if I'd want to go if I knew that was why. A family emergency is one thing, a vacation just says her enjoyment is more important than everyone else's time and money", "Such a good point hahahaha OMFG", "And they're probably used to placating the irrational one as the easiest way to keep the peace.", "squeaky wheel syndrome", "Made up parents do all the time though...", "She can ask, but also has to accept that 'no' is a valid answer.", "I also work in an industry where we do charitable raffles, I think we had around a half dozen or so travel packages this year centered around events that were date specific. Sporting events, concerts, awards ceremonies, etc and its very clear in the policies that the date is non-transferable. If the sister won something like that she would have to go during the preselected dates or forfeit the trip.", "Can they exchange the trips for cash?", "A house or bird hunting lol.", "You can't count on 3 weeks any more - ever since the pandemic hit, processing times have been slower even for expedited. Currently paying extra gets you 3-5 weeks. If she doesn't have a passport, she'd have to go to the nearest regional passport agency like you might have suggested, but that could be hours away and appointments aren't guaranteed.", "If your travel date is inside 2 weeks and you can go to a passport office, you'll get one in days for like an extra $50 or so.", "Good luck with that. Even expedited passports take longer than that these days", "My expedited passport this time last year took 12 weeks to get.", "Not a sure thing any more in the US.", "So you would be fine if your sibling a month before your wedding started entering contests that could clash with your wedding? Basically actively trying to miss it?\n\nIts one thing if it more or less fell in their lap. Its another if they seek it out.\n\n>Weddings are special, but a free grand trip is a once in a lifetime event.\n\nIf you have no faith in your sibling's relationship, I guess I would agree that their wedding wouldn't be a once in a lifetime event. A little assholeness in there though either way.", "Just wanted to say that this is such a beautiful sentiment to her and I\u2019m so sorry for the loss of your aunt \ud83d\udc95", "They\u2019re the favorites first. Their treatment as the favorite results in them becoming irrational.", "This! 100% true and so so sad. People really need to stop enabling the irrational sibling", "Yes. It's also hilarious that she thinks that THEY are selfish for not changing the entire wedding for *her*.", "She can ask, but there's no excuse for her continuing to and throwing a fit, basically", "I won a raffle at a charity gala. Prize was flights to NYC from UK/Ireland, 3 nights in a hotel and tickets to see a particular concert. Gala was in May, concert was in December and there was a very small degree of flexibility in the booking. The concert was happening on 2 nights, a Thursday and friday, we could choose which night we wanted, and then also choose our flight dates around that. The T&Cs were very clear if we couldnt make either of the 2 dates in December, there would be no alternative offered, no cash value and not transferable in any way.", "That would mean that it is the sisters decision as to which she prefers to attend. OP Does not have to cater to her", "You can get a same day passport if you live near a major passport office and can prove travel internationally within the next 2 weeks. This requires an appointment. I\u2019ve done it for my minor son.", "Wait times are down dramatically now. I got my passport non renewal and non expedited in about five weeks just a few months ago.", "Eh, my husband got one in 2 days, and that was just last month", "I got mine and my three daughters within 8 days of submitting. No expedited, we have four months before our trip.", "I would be fine with it.My brother scheduled his wedding for only 4 weeks after I was due with my 2nd kid. I told him that if I wasn't up to coming, I would get him a better gift. She ended up coming 2 weeks early, and was my easiest delivery, so we attended. But, life happens. His wedding wasn't any more about me, than mine was (ETA: about him) years earlier. We spent hardly any time together at either event.", "A lot of these contests usually have other prizes available too. Free fuel for a month, a small sum of hard cash, a free weekend at a hotel etc etc. And at the very top is a car or large sum of cash or a free holiday. So yeah, it's probably fine to enter a contest like this because no one actually expects to hit the jackpot. Until they do.", "Yeah. Wedding is a party, not a summons. If my sibling won a trip like that, I'd ban them from the wedding so they'd go. Hell. If they don't go, I will. I'll just elope after XD and if I won it instead, I'd go. I'm the sister of the groom. Nobody is really going to notice if I'm gone except my mom. I'd support family if I can, but at the end of the day, it's my life, and going on a once in a lifetime trip would enrich it more than an anxiety invoking party.", "Chicken and egg thing, it seems.", "This is what I came to say. In my family, they started out a little irrational, a LOT the favorite, and grew more irrational as time has gone on.", "Obviously lol", "In my (3rd world) country the regular passport takes about 3 weeks. A faster one 1 week. Urgent 48 hs. And you can get an emergency one in 24 hs. \n\nI don't get why it takes so long in the US!", "It depends on season and other factors. The number of weeks it takes has been different every time I look on the website.", "It didn\u2019t used to take so long, but ever since the pandemic wait times are wayyyy up. I know people are commenting that it doesn\u2019t take long anymore, but this is a big country and what\u2019s true in one city/state is not necessarily true in another."]}
