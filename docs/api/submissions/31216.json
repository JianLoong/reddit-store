But here's where it gets complicated. My sister, who I'm very close to, just won an all-expenses-paid trip to  Europe. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for her, but the dates clash with my wedding. She asked me to postpone the wedding so she can attend both events. I told her I can't change the date because of our non-refundable bookings and guests who have already made travel plans. My sister got upset, saying I'm being inflexible and not considering her feelings.My parents think I should try to accommodate her, but my fianc\u00e9 and friends say we shouldn't have to change our plans.

Not only would it be next to impossible to change on such short notice, you would be out a ton of time and money, as would other people who are traveling to the wedding. What she's asking is extremely selfish. Did she offer to cover all the expenses that would be involved? I'm guessing not. \n\nShe can either miss a couple days of activities and fly back for the wedding before going back to the vacation or perhaps you can setup a video feed that she can watch live.", "I find it difficult to believe that she JUST won a free trip that's taking place next month.\n\nI would bet a large sum of money that the dates for the trip are flexible and she somehow selected next month by mistake.", "NTA. Years ago before my nephew was born, my sister and her husband won an all expenses paid trip to Costa Rica whose dates landed around her due date. They were able to get the dates moved by making a few phone calls. Your sister needs to try and get the dates changed.", "NTA, Your sister is the one who has a conflicting event. She needs to work it out. It is not fair (or financially feasible) to inconvenience yourself, your fiance' ,family & friends because she won a free trip.", "NTA\n\nHer trip is only valid during the time of your wedding?  Strange.  She\u2019s the one with a conflict therefore it\u2019s her responsibility to figure it out.  Even asking you to consider changing was ballsy as hell.", "This story is so ridiculous it has to be true. NTA. Your sis just doesn't want to give up the trip to go to your wedding. She wants to put the decision on you so as to make her absence your fault and deflect family shaming onto you (successfully where your folks are concerned). She knows full well you can't just change wedding dates a month out. It would have to be a major emergency for anyone to do that willingly, and a guest's vacation doesn't count as an emergency except to that guest.\n\nI also think it's strange that this last minute prize must be used precisely on those dates, but even so, SHE has to make a choice.", "This doesn't make any sense, I'm sure your guests were all notified of the date, not sure if any had to buy plane tickets to be there, the venue has set schedules that are planned months in advance, and your sister and parents (!) want you to move it all to accommodate her? OK.\n\nIf this is true, I feel sorry for you that you have such an inconsiderate family.  Congrats on your wedding, don't change a thing.  NTA", "NTA. She can't expect you to change the date when others are affected; if it was a family dinner, sure, but others have made travel arrangements and taken time off work.", "NTA. I am sorry, but a wedding is - no matter how long it takes to plan - a party. Your sister is a guest at said party. There is no reason to move a whole party because one guest can't make it.", "NTA. It would be almost impossible to move the wedding at such short notice, and even if you could, you would almost certainly take a financial hit. It's also not fair for you to ask your guests to reschedule - they have taken time off work, made travel plans, and incurred their own costs. It's unfortunate, but your sister is the one with a choice to make, not you", "NTA. Your wedding is next month, not next year.  What she's asking is unrealistic.  Your wedding is YOUR most important event,  and the trip is hers. Don't reschedule.  People have likely booked travel, you won't get all your money back, and quite frankly she's entitled to even think you should reschedule for her.", "NTA, she can attend via zoom maybe? But she's very selfish to ask you to change the date. If she really wants to be there in person, she can give away the trip to someone deserving.", "NTA - that's a sucky situation for sure, but your sister doesn't get to guilt you into *very* expensive, last minute wedding plan changes so she can go on a free trip. If she (or your parents) can pay for the changes, maybe it would be reasonable, but even then you have every right to say no.", "\"My parents think we should try to accommodate her...\"\n\nThen your parents are just as ridiculous and entitled as she is. This is just about the nuttiest thing to ask an engaged couple ever. Who does she think she is?\n\nNTA", "NTA - she will have to choose", "NTA.  I doubt her story is true.", "Zoom the wedding", "Nta.\n\nTell sister and parents.\n\nThis is a once in a lifetime event for her. Guess what it is for me as well. Why should we move the date so she doesn't miss anything. Why is it ok to make us lose money on non refundable things. Spend more to change dates. Have family and friends spend more money on changes for flights and hotels. FOR ONE PERSON? Why is her holiday more important than my wedding? Why is her choice and wants more important than all the people this inconveniences. \n\nIs she going to pay the money we lose to change dates? All of it not just the refundable? Is she or you going to pay lost wages for the guests, money for changes they have to make? Because if not its entitled behavior from all three of you to think it's ok to do this not just to us but everyone else. \n\nSo no, I will not change anything. She can make her choice. It will not be brought up again other than a yes or no if she will attend and if you as parents bring this up once more showing who you favor you can just be uninvited as this us my day and I won't let you ruin it by favoring my sister.", "Giving in to your sister will be stripping your other guests of the time and money they have put in to attend your wedding.\n\nPeople have put in PTO and paid reservations that they likely can't get back.\n\nIt's quite a slap in the face to tell them your sister's time and 'free' money is worth more.\n\nI'd refuse to rebook anything to attend the new date as I wouldn't trust it won't happen again.

If she feels like this trip is more important than attending your wedding than that's on her. Seems like both your sister and your parents don't realize what postponing means, you'll have to rebook the venue, the food, everything and deal with the fallback of the people that already spent money on tickets to come to your wedding. Whose going to be paying for all that lost money? Unfortunately now you know who your parents favourite is.", "NTA.\n\nYou have your wedding; she goes on her once-in-a-lifetime trip. You both live your best lives, be happy for each other, and you\u2019ll both have interesting memories to share with each other.", "Do people actually make such requests? First of all, the request to change wedding dates to accommodate a guest's (she's close family but still a wedding guest) vacation is absurd on the face of it. I can't believe she even made that request. Second of all, your parents saying that you should try to accommodate her is even more absurd. I'd have expected them to be the first set of people who set your sister straight, not ask you and your fiance to change dates. Do they hate you or something? If my parents said something like that, I'd ask them to join the sister on vacation instead of going to the wedding\n\neasy NTA", "NTA - wedding planning takes a lot of money and time, I\u2019ve been there. Your wedding is your special day and you\u2019ve been looking foreword to it for a long time so don\u2019t change it especially this close to your wedding day. As for your parents, they are in the wrong for asking you to change your wedding plans. Sounds like some bs favoritism and you deserve better.", "NTA. I mean why should you pay the price (literally) for her trip? It does sound like tu e opportunity of a lifetime but she should then just accept that you won\u2019t cater to her. Too many of your guests have already booked everything, as have you.", "I", "NTA\nEeddings planned that far in advance aren't flexible. You've oaid deposits, you've sent out invitations,  you've told people, you've entered into contracts..\n\nAre you being inflexible? Yes. But that's the nature of weddings. The closer you get to the date, the less flexible you are. \n\nTell your sister you'll set up streaming so she can watch via a link. Your sister is being selfish and unreasonable.", "If all the details are as you say, then you are NTA. Your sister is actually the one being inflexible as in theory, a wedding can also be a once in a lifetime experience. Many only marry once, or if they have had multiple weddings have one that is more grandiose than the other. Marriages are investments and costly and like you said, take ages to plan. Your sister has every right to attend the trip, but she doesn\u2019t have a right to expect you to change your big day to accommodate her. The right thing to do, in my opinion, is to seek your approval for taking the trip. If you\u2019re ok with her missing you wedding, she would give you a very generous gift or offer to celebrate your day another day in a way that allows the two of you to connect for a special occasion - E.g. offer to treat you to a nice dinner or something. That\u2019s just an idea.", "NTA\n\nwhy should you change your wedding plans to suit 1 person, even if it is your sister. You have paid money out that is not refundable.

She\u2019s the only one being inconsiderate in this situation. As many others have said, she can probably get the dates of this trip changed. \n\nBut asking you to change the date of your wedding that will affect more than just you is utterly selfish of her. \n\nLet\u2019s say you have 30 people traveling to your wedding. That\u2019s 30 people that have already spent the money on airfare/gas, rental cars, accommodations, etc. \n\nThen factor in all the money you\u2019d lose on deposits and may even have to pay for short notice cancellation!! \n\nTell her that your wedding is about *YOU*, not her.

Her trip is once in a lifetime for her.", "NTA my cousin just got married and his sister had a literal child and didn\u2019t make the wedding.

Its unfortunate sure, but not your fault", "NTA\u2026and you, fiance and friends already know that. Most of the time\u2026when one wins something like a vacation it\u2019s not tied to specific dates unless it\u2019s a Christmas or Easter or cultural event thing\u2026has she actually looked to see if dates are flexible?", "NTA.

To cover all the guests costs for their booked plans?  If not date does not change.\n\nThat is crazed on her part to expect it.  Why can't she fly home for wedding then return for rest of vacation?", "NTA what entitlement to ask someone to change a huge life event and all other relatives travel plans for her. I agree that a trip to Europe for free is also unmissable so the only solution is that she doesn\u2019t come. Try your best to video chat her in (though this might be hard overseas) and that\u2019s that. Sometimes everything isn\u2019t possible and that\u2019s ok.

Does she want to reimburse you for the cancellation fees? No, she doesn\u2019t!  This is YOUR wedding. Her feelings don\u2019t matter regarding this event - YOURS and Your Future Husband\u2019s feelings are priority. I say video tape the event &/or go Facebook live or FaceTime with her so she can pseudo attend. Have Fun and enjoy your special day! \ud83d\ude01 Let any Drahhma roll off your feathers!!!", "Perhaps the sister should petition the company she won the trip from to move the trip as it would be far easier for them to do so in order for her to attend her own sister's wedding than all your wedding guests trying to change their approved time off from work, their tickets, their accommodations, their timeline for wedding outfits et cetera.\n\nIt's ridiculous to ask you and all your wedding guests to try to change all those logistics at great cost to bank account and jobs (risking their job if they try to change their days off at the last moment) and would cause probably at least 4 people not be able to come on the new wedding date if not more compared to the 1 of the sister.\n\nThe prize winning company may have a lot more flexibility and a lot more insurance and cash to cover the changes plus a sweet PR story of how they made sure their winner wouldn't miss a family member's wedding.", "NTA. Everyone else has booked and paid for their travel expenses to your wedding and to postpone is going to put off guests for the new dates they are going to lose money and so are you with all the non-refundable expenses from the venue, planner, catering etc.", "Nta, unless it's super important I wouldn't change the dates or make my other guests change their plans as well. This hurts more than just you and your fiance. Your parents may be ok taking whatever hit to get to your wedding, but other guests won't be.

That's something they can't do again.", "NTA\u2026why is it that so many people want a couple to change their wedding date that they planned for, for some time?  Why do they think it is so easy?  Why are they telling you that it should be ok to lose all your deposits?  You cannot change your date.  That is a fact.  There are so many plans already in place, things paid for, and not only for you.  I would sit down, write down a list of all costs you would lose, all costs that family and friends would lose, and all expenses that you would have to re put out to plan another wedding, and add your \u201ctime\u201d involved as a cost factor as well.  Tell your sister and parents that it is not about flexibility, (if you were in the early stages, that might have been possible), it is about logistics, cost, time and energy.  You will be sorry if she cannot attend, but you understand she has a fabulous opportunity to take advantage of.", "NTA, and the fact that they are even asking you is absurd.", "No you are not the asshole. You have been planning this for over a year and her trip is something that just came up recently. It won't be fair for her to expect you to do this for her because your wedding is also something very special and a once in a lifetime event and what about expenses who will accommodate them plus you will be inconveniencing so many other people your guests so don't listen to her", "This is strange.  Why should you change your wedding date with all that entails to accommodate your sister? Her feelings?! She sounds entitled and selfish. What about your feelings?
