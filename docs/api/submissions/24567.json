Maybe she is struggling with the official end of her identity as an individual. It is one of the many reasons I didn\u2019t want to change my last name. However, it\u2019s also entirely possible that the paperwork is too tedious and time consuming and she just doesn\u2019t see the point. I have a friend who was all set to change her name. She went to her appointment, waited a few hours, and then found out she needed a different piece of paperwork from the one they originally told her she needed. She said screw it and never changed her name. There are so many reasons why your wife is reluctant to have her name legally changed, but that is ultimately her choice. To hold that over her head when it comes to something as serious as having kids is absolutely absurd. Your comment about not being on the birth certificate is also ridiculous. You will likely be there for the birth. You will sign the birth certificate. However, even if you weren\u2019t there and your wife had legally changed her name, it really wouldn\u2019t be any different at all. My daughter\u2019s birth certificate has both of our names in it despite me not changing my name. That doesn\u2019t preclude you from being on it like you seem to think. Nor does her having your last name force her to have you sign it?? That\u2019s such a weird argument. As is the argument that she won\u2019t do other paperwork. Just because she\u2019s deciding not to do this doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t fill out necessary paperwork. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like you don\u2019t trust her at all.

If you told her this from the beginning and she agreed but now backing out after y\u2019all got married she\u2019s wrong. If she doesn\u2019t want to change it then she should\u2019ve spoken up about it instead of just dragging it out. If this is your deal breaker that\u2019s fine but you can\u2019t force her to change her name now. \n\nIf it\u2019s a deal breaker, leave. Or try having a conversation with her about it and she needs to just come out as to why she\u2019s dragging her feet on it.

You're basing maturity on how she doesn't want to go to the DMV (um spoiler, no one does).

And the flags are blood-red and flapping in everyone\u2019s faces here. \n\nAlso you said something like \u201cwell then I changed my mind about having kids\u201d. That\u2019s cruel and hateful.
