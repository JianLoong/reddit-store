The divorce was pretty high conflict and they have never been the kind of people who stayed in each other's lives outside of me. I have been told repeatedly there was no cheating but my mom has admitted to me in recent years that she did not like how dad treated her at the end of their marriage. But she said that did not mean it needed to come between me and him. It just meant she would never be capable of being friends with him or forming a makeshift wider family with all of us.\n\nMy dad got married for the second time when I was like 5. His wife and him have had an awkward relationship. They are sort of open but in the past were also kinda on and off. So they have kids with other people and each other from the last 11 years. \n\nThe dynamic has meant they don't have a lot. Of us all I am the most financially secure because mom has always taken good care of me and she can afford things my dad can't. We have vacationed every year except for 2020 and 2021. Sometimes we even go twice a year. I have been all over the world with my mom. Dad could never afford a vacation. I also get new clothes whenever I need/want something new while they have to share a lot of hand me downs and thrift store buys. I get more gifts at Christmas every year and better gifts. They mostly get practical stuff while I get fun stuff. When I turned 16 my mom bought me a nice, but second hand, car. None of the others are that age yet by my dad and his wife won't be able to afford it.\n\nSo with vacations. My mom has always asked me where I'd like to go. Normally my first choice has won out but not always. But I always go for fun places. This is something dad pointed out a lot in the last couple of years. He said it was all stuff a lot of kids would like and I was like yeah, because mom gives me input in the decision of where. Dad was like, so you request these places and I'm like yeah. \n\nMom and I got back from vacation last week and when I went to my dad's he was pissed. He said I am selfish and cruel to request these vacations when I know the other kids would love to go to all these places and he accused me of intentionally choosing places they will never be able to go just to be a dick to them. I said no. But I won't lie about where I want to go to spare their feelings. He said I should. That I should love and care about them enough not to let them miss out like that. I told him it wasn't my problem.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688202903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nqhzc/aita_for_requesting_my_mom_and_i_go_on_vacations/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These are places my dad's family won't be able to afford to go. My step and half siblings sometimes feel jealous and bad that I always get to go to cool places and they don't.

If he has different kids from within his marriage and outside of it he should have better prepared to be able to pay for them. It\u2019s not your responsibility to actively do something about his inability to do fun things with his kids or to put off your ability to do things that you want.

Just because he has a crazy messy life and I don\u2019t know how many kids (info: how many?), doesn\u2019t mean you need to mold your life around them.

To actively accuse you of being selfish and cruel is him projecting his own insecurities of not being able to give his kids the lifestyle you get to have. But that is a him problem. It\u2019s not your fault. You didn\u2019t create the situation he\u2019s in. That\u2019s all on him and the choices he\u2019s made.", "NTA OP\n\nNot your kids, not your responsibility.\n\nAlso dad and stepmom need to learn about birth control instead of keeping on breeding like rabbits when they know they can't afford the babies.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If so, there's your Dad's problem.  He chose kids over vacations.  Not your problem.", "NTA. Especially if you don't choose the destinations to show your halfsiblings you're better off.\nYour father cjose his relationships, to father many children with many different women if I read that correctly, and therefore it's his own fault he has many children that can't afford much.\nYou don't have to feel bad that your mother took good care of you. She's a single mum and can give you a great life, you father chose an unconventional life style so it was his choice to not be financiqlly well off. Pretty easy.", "NTA. I'm divorced with a 16 year old daughter. I have a good job, I'm not remarried, and have no other kids. My ex remarried and has three other kids. They're both teachers and he pays child support, so they can't afford to take that many people on the same kinds of trips we go on. \n\nI enjoy taking a nice vacation with her every year, and my daughter and I plan our trips to be things we would both enjoy. I think travel is a great experience both for learning and spending time together. \n\nWhat I can afford to do with my daughter has nothing to do with my ex or his new family. Fortunately, we get along reasonably well, and it has never occurred to my ex to expect that my daughter shouldn't get to do things that he can't take his other kids to do.\n\nYou and your mom aren't responsible for your dad and his other family. It's perfectly fine that you and your mom get to do things together. It doesn't have to be equal.", "NTA and he's a shitty parent for wanting his child to miss out on things to spare his feelings of jealousy and inadequacy.", "Sounds like he\u2019s feeling inadequate and taking it out on you, it\u2019s shitty for him to even think his child could be so vindictive. \nDo you talk about these trips and all the stuff you get with the other kids?", "Nta, sorry you\u2019re going through this OP.

I do feel bad that your siblings don\u2019t get to go, but that\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA, I don't think that your dad is asking that his kids l go too, as that would be so unrealistic and especially bonkers if he expects his stepkids to also go.

His thinking is way off base.  \n\nEnjoy your vacations and clothes, etc, that your mom provides.", "He\u2019s jealous and insecure.  YNTA. I don\u2019t think he wants you mom to take his other children on Vaca.  Maybe just don\u2019t talk about the vacations unless someone asks and don\u2019t rub it in.  Sounds like he\u2019ll never afford vacations like that, but his kids might be able to when they are older and on their own.  It might encourage them to get a good job and travel.  You never know.", "He's just insecure about what he can afford because of the past choices he made. It's not ypir mothers job to take her ex's children on vacation.", "True. But I guess the extra siblings from different partners is hard to hide."]}
