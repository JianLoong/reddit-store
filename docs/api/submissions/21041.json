Of us all I am the most financially secure because mom has always taken good care of me and she can afford things my dad can't. We have vacationed every year except for 2020 and 2021. Sometimes we even go twice a year. I have been all over the world with my mom. Dad could never afford a vacation. I also get new clothes whenever I need/want something new while they have to share a lot of hand me downs and thrift store buys. I get more gifts at Christmas every year and better gifts.

None of the others are that age yet by my dad and his wife won't be able to afford it.\n\nSo with vacations. My mom has always asked me where I'd like to go. Normally my first choice has won out but not always. But I always go for fun places. This is something dad pointed out a lot in the last couple of years.

Dad was like, so you request these places and I'm like yeah. \n\nMom and I got back from vacation last week and when I went to my dad's he was pissed. He said I am selfish and cruel to request these vacations when I know the other kids would love to go to all these places and he accused me of intentionally choosing places they will never be able to go just to be a dick to them. I said no. But I won't lie about where I want to go to spare their feelings. He said I should. That I should love and care about them enough not to let them miss out like that.
