I 21m and my brother 29m were planning on getting an apartment together. We had discussed the details but not everything and ultimately had made a deal that once he broke his lease he could stay with a friend for a month until we could find a place. \n\nHe was originally telling me he was looking for a roommate and I suggested finding a place together as his landlord wanted him out and he couldn\u2019t afford to live alone anymore. Once I brought it up and he agreed from there we said we would split the rent and that was pretty much it just had to wait for him to break the lease. \n\nHe broke his lease 2 weeks ago so we\u2019ve been looking for apartments and 2 separate times he got mad at me and left me hanging by that I mean just left the showing and didn\u2019t talk to me for a bit. The second time he got mad at me he got disrespectful swearing and yelling. After he left that day again I tried to reach him and couldn\u2019t. \n\nBoth times he got upset I won\u2019t go into detail but it was about who would pay for parking, utilities etc. We had not agreed on those stuff before hand so when they came up we had no pre set agreement like the rent. Regardless I tried to find a solution both times like an adult but my brother just gets mad and leaves anytime something didn\u2019t go his way. \n\nThe last straw was he finally calls me back after a few days about the apartment and tells me to be ready to go later today to a viewing we scheduled. I told him not going, he then threatens me and says he\u2019s gonna make me go before hanging up. \n\nAt this point I\u2019ve decided I was no longer going to rent an apartment with him. My reasons being I\u2019m not gonna rent an apartment with someone who is gonna get mad and start cursing me out whenever we have a house disagreement. Secondly I\u2019m not gonna live with someone who thinks they can just threaten me to do what they please. In every issue I\u2019ve tried to talk to over like an adult but he just refuses.\n\nHis gf called me after I started ignoring him and told me to reconsider because if not my brother will be homeless without a roommate and he only broke his lease because of me in the first place. I told her my reasons and said no. Conversation went on for like an hour, I\u2019ve known his gf a long time and although she really tried to convince me she eventually understood that I wouldn\u2019t be changing my mind.\n\nAITA for changing my mind and not renting an apartment with him?", "created_utc": 1683039833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135o9a0/aita_for_backing_out_of_apartment_deal_with/", "score": 167, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep your distance. It is crazy that he is treating his brother who is 8 years younger like this. Also, it is very telling that he doesn\u2019t like with his girlfriend and she says you\u2019re his only option. Keep your distance!!!!", "NTA. You clearly shouldn\u2019t live with your brother, but how did you not realize this beforehand?", "NTA.\n\nYour brother's an AH whose own girlfriend evidently doesn't want to live with him.\n\nYou were not the reason he left his old place.\n\nYou are not responsible for housing him (and apparently subsidizing him). He just thought he could take advantage of you.\n\nHe can find a roommate like other people often have to.", "NTA - I agree with your concerns based on your description of his behavior.  He sounds like someone who is going to expect you to pay for anything he doesn't absolutely have to. Plus, I am guessing there are some relationship issues based on him being so much older than you and how he threatened you when you said you were not going to go to the showing.", "NTA. You and your older and supposedly more mature brother are incompatible roommates. He is short tempered, manipulative, and abusive. There is a good reason his landlord wants him out, and those reasons will transfer to you if you move in with him. His girlfriend is calling you to convince you to take him on because she knows how problematic he is, and she doesn't want that for herself. Stand firm, and keep ignoring his calls. He is a desperate bully, rapidly running out of options and looking for someone to blame.", "INFO:  Did he not think you should split the cost for parking and utilities? Do you both have cars? \n\nGenerally, I feel like it would help a lot to get more clarity on your disagreement about parking and utilities.", "NTA Why is he saying he is going to make you go? I mean does he have a short fuse or am not understanding correctly. I think a roommate that is respectful and decent is a great idea, but is your brother respectful to you? I am editing. You didn\u2019t go into details but are financial burdens equal? Something had to make you feel uncomfortable to change your mind.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are right not to rent with him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"His gf called me after I started ignoring him and told me to reconsider because if not my brother will be homeless without a roommate\" ... Perfect: His gf can live with him. Problem solved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and he only broke his lease because of me in the first place. \" .. NO. He did this because he is a stupid AH. Or because he got evicted. But not for you.", ">\this landlord wanted him out \n\nI\u2019ll go out on a limb, and speculate the landlord wants him out due to anger issues. You most certainly don\u2019t want to live with him and take that on. \n\nNTA", "NTA if his girlfriend wants to help him so bad why isn\u2019t she living with him?

Your lucky", ">We had discussed the details but not everything and ultimately had made a deal that once he broke his lease he could stay with a friend for a month until we could find a place.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour brother sounds like an asshole in general, which is why you should have actually paid attention to \"the details\" before agreeing to move with him. How fees for utilities/parking/etc. are paid is not a minor consideration, and that should have been a conversation from Day 1.\n\nAt this point, not moving in together might be the right move.

If we ever get into a fight when rent is due is he just gonna leave me in the dark for days until he\u2019s ready to contact me again? I\u2019m not gonna put myself in that situation.

Only thing with parking, utilities etc is as that we had no idea on those things or if we would have to pay them at all depending on where we moved to. The only thing that was involved in everything would\u2019ve been the rent cost.", "Definitely NTA. You're dodging a bullet.", "Being home more or not doesn\u2019t warrant paying more utilities. It\u2019s always a proportionate split unless someone is doing something wildly outside of normal usage like running a grow operation in the basement. If he is trying to nickel and dime before even moving it, he won\u2019t be a good housemate. He can always look for a shared room with someone else", "He wants you to subsidize his lifestyle.\n\nThis won't stop. For example, you'll have to pay for Netflix bc \"he doesn't use it\" (but oddly, he'll still want the password).", "I completely understand this. It isn\u2019t fair to you  to be stressed out like this. TBH, I would pass on this.", "Honey you assumed your brother would act like an adult which he clearly can't do. It's telling his girlfriend tried to make you to reconsider instead of living with him.\n\nOn a better note It's great that you discovered all that before having a legal contract with a violent toddler.", "NTA. Good thing you\u2019re not rooming with him. Sounds like be he wants to take advantage of you. Nope.", "No offense, but your brother doesn't seem all that smart. Who breaks a lease without having a place ready to move in to? I also highly doubt he's going to pay any of his bills; he'll leave you holding the bag every month.

He would just say he\u2019s not paying I am and storm off. \n\nWe never actually had one discussion about what the utility split would be or any type of compromise for the parking. We lost the first apartment we found because after ignoring me and leaving the landlord didn\u2019t want us. \n\nHe just blows up and stops discussing anything he doesn\u2019t agree with and then I have to chase him down for days to get an update. This is why I backed out it wasn\u2019t even about the actually amount of money. I didn\u2019t even mind splitting the utilities based on usage because I would be using more but he doesn\u2019t even know cause we couldn\u2019t even get that far.", "> I have already tried to get clarity with him, he said I was getting on his fucking nerves and that he will not pay half before hanging up on me.

Either way, let me him figure his own shit out, he clearly doesn't have your back.", "NTA. If your brother wanted you as a roommate he should have treated you with respect and not threatened you. You didn't break the agreement, your brother broke the spirit of the agreement by making it clear that living with him would be toxic, abusive and possibly violent.   \n\n\nYou're making the right choice. Your brother needs to check himself and figure out why he thinks he can simultaneously abuse you and ask you for favors. How delusional and entitled.", "NTA.\n\nFrom reading the responses you are giving others about his behavior & finances I\u2019d say you have a right to say no to him moving in. The way he is acting towards you is alarming in so many ways. Please do not give in to him and his tantrums and stand your ground. I feel like he\u2019s start ditching payments because of how he won\u2019t even give you a straight answer about where his money comes from, that should have been an immediate red flag. Just because he\u2019s your brother doesn\u2019t mean you have to deal with his childish demeanor.", "NTA. It sucks that he broke his lease for you but he\u2019s also admitted that he couldn\u2019t afford a place on his own so he would have to break that lease anyways. \n\nI don\u2019t care for the fact that he\u2019s verbally abusive and threatening on the phone.  This guy has anger management issues that he doesn\u2019t think are a problem.  Agree that if he\u2019s like this now to you, it would be worse living together. \n\nHis views are also strange when it comes to splitting costs - just because he doesn\u2019t have a car, you\u2019d have to pay for both? If it\u2019s included cost, he would split. If you\u2019re having to pay extra\u2026 just don\u2019t pay for his stall and he would have to make separate arrangements once he gets a car.", "If girlfriend doesn\u2019t want him to be homeless she can let him live with her.", "But wasn't he toxic and abusive before? Is this the first time he's behaved this way towards you?", "NTA. You're very lucky you're seeing this behavior now instead of after you moved in.", "NTA you made a good decision. It seems like yall aren't compatible personality wise as roommates & can't agree on bill splits. Plus, it kinda seems like he's just using you. If they're so worried about brother being homeless, he can go live with his gf.", "Nta\n There is a reason why his girlfriend is not an option. Read the signs and avoid this situation like the plague.", "He has had run ins with quite a few other family members over different issues I don\u2019t know the full details as I was younger for most of them. \n\nTo me he has been rude before and disrespectful before but it wasn\u2019t really about anything serious."]}
