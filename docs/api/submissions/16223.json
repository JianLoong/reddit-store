I 21m and my brother 29m were planning on getting an apartment together. We had discussed the details but not everything and ultimately had made a deal that once he broke his lease he could stay with a friend for a month until we could find a place. \n\nHe was originally telling me he was looking for a roommate and I suggested finding a place together as his landlord wanted him out and he couldn\u2019t afford to live alone anymore. Once I brought it up and he agreed from there we said we would split the rent and that was pretty much it just had to wait for him to break the lease. \n\nHe broke his lease 2 weeks ago so we\u2019ve been looking for apartments and 2 separate times he got mad at me and left me hanging by that I mean just left the showing and didn\u2019t talk to me for a bit. The second time he got mad at me he got disrespectful swearing and yelling. After he left that day again I tried to reach him and couldn\u2019t. \n\nBoth times he got upset I won\u2019t go into detail but it was about who would pay for parking, utilities etc. We had not agreed on those stuff before hand so when they came up we had no pre set agreement like the rent. Regardless I tried to find a solution both times like an adult but my brother just gets mad and leaves anytime something didn\u2019t go his way. \n\nThe last straw was he finally calls me back after a few days about the apartment and tells me to be ready to go later today to a viewing we scheduled. I told him not going, he then threatens me and says he\u2019s gonna make me go before hanging up. \n\nAt this point I\u2019ve decided I was no longer going to rent an apartment with him. My reasons being I\u2019m not gonna rent an apartment with someone who is gonna get mad and start cursing me out whenever we have a house disagreement. Secondly I\u2019m not gonna live with someone who thinks they can just threaten me to do what they please. In every issue I\u2019ve tried to talk to over like an adult but he just refuses.\n\nHis gf called me after I started ignoring him and told me to reconsider because if not my brother will be homeless without a roommate and he only broke his lease because of me in the first place. I told her my reasons and said no. Conversation went on for like an hour, I\u2019ve known his gf a long time and although she really tried to convince me she eventually understood that I wouldn\u2019t be changing my mind.\n\nAITA for changing my mind and not renting an apartment with him?", "created_utc": 1683039833, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135o9a0/aita_for_backing_out_of_apartment_deal_with/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep your distance. It is crazy that he is treating his brother who is 8 years younger like this. Also, it is very telling that he doesn\u2019t like with his girlfriend and she says you\u2019re his only option. Keep your distance!!!!", "NTA. You clearly shouldn\u2019t live with your brother, but how did you not realize this beforehand?", "NTA.\n\nYour brother's an AH whose own girlfriend evidently doesn't want to live with him.\n\nYou were not the reason he left his old place.\n\nYou are not responsible for housing him (and apparently subsidizing him). He just thought he could take advantage of you.\n\nHe can find a roommate like other people often have to.", "NTA - I agree with your concerns based on your description of his behavior.  He sounds like someone who is going to expect you to pay for anything he doesn't absolutely have to. Plus, I am guessing there are some relationship issues based on him being so much older than you and how he threatened you when you said you were not going to go to the showing.", "NTA. You and your older and supposedly more mature brother are incompatible roommates. He is short tempered, manipulative, and abusive. There is a good reason his landlord wants him out, and those reasons will transfer to you if you move in with him. His girlfriend is calling you to convince you to take him on because she knows how problematic he is, and she doesn't want that for herself. Stand firm, and keep ignoring his calls. He is a desperate bully, rapidly running out of options and looking for someone to blame.", "INFO:  Did he not think you should split the cost for parking and utilities? Do you both have cars? \n\nGenerally, I feel like it would help a lot to get more clarity on your disagreement about parking and utilities.", "NTA Why is he saying he is going to make you go? I mean does he have a short fuse or am not understanding correctly. I think a roommate that is respectful and decent is a great idea, but is your brother respectful to you? I am editing. You didn\u2019t go into details but are financial burdens equal? Something had to make you feel uncomfortable to change your mind.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are right not to rent with him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"His gf called me after I started ignoring him and told me to reconsider because if not my brother will be homeless without a roommate\" ... Perfect: His gf can live with him. Problem solved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and he only broke his lease because of me in the first place. \" .. NO. He did this because he is a stupid AH. Or because he got evicted. But not for you.", ">\this landlord wanted him out \n\nI\u2019ll go out on a limb, and speculate the landlord wants him out due to anger issues. You most certainly don\u2019t want to live with him and take that on. \n\nNTA", "NTA if his girlfriend wants to help him so bad why isn\u2019t she living with him? Oh cause he\u2019s a nightmare lol", "Nope.  You dodged a BulletYou did not need that living arrangement of verbal abuse that may turn physical. Your lucky", ">We had discussed the details but not everything and ultimately had made a deal that once he broke his lease he could stay with a friend for a month until we could find a place.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nYour brother sounds like an asshole in general, which is why you should have actually paid attention to \"the details\" before agreeing to move with him. How fees for utilities/parking/etc. are paid is not a minor consideration, and that should have been a conversation from Day 1.\n\nAt this point, not moving in together might be the right move.  You're still both assholes and this might be a nail in the coffin of your relationship, so.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What made me change my mind is I have no interest in living with someone who is gonna treat me like this and act like a 5 year old. If we ever get into a fight when rent is due is he just gonna leave me in the dark for days until he\u2019s ready to contact me again? I\u2019m not gonna put myself in that situation.

It\u2019s always a proportionate split unless someone is doing something wildly outside of normal usage like running a grow operation in the basement.

He can always look for a shared room with someone else", "He wants you to subsidize his lifestyle.\n\nThis won't stop.

It's telling his girlfriend tried to make you to reconsider instead of living with him.\n\nOn a better note It's great that you discovered all that before having a legal contract with a violent toddler."]}
