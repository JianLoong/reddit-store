She lives near and has a close relationship with our mom. I live in a different country. I am very-low-contact with our mom due to child trauma (I've had extensive therapy.)\n\nI gave birth to a stillborn baby girl in 2017 at 35.5 weeks. It was terrifying and traumatising and, for anyone else who has been in this boat, I highly recommend the charity Sands.\n\nMy family were not very supportive. I get it: baby death makes people weird.\n\nMy daughter\u2019s death took a huge toll on my mental health. I mention this because I feel it contributes to my anxiety about being TA.\n\nIn 2019 my sister became pregnant with a baby girl. I was happy for her and excited to become an Aunt. I also had a lot of difficult feelings. My sister has always managed to outshine me, and I still carry some of that insecurity. It was irrational to think she got pregnant to spite me, but my grief-addled brain was not rational. I expressed to my sister and mom that I was struggling a bit and that although I was overjoyed, I may occasionally need to go \u201coffline\u201d for a couple days to tend to my emotions.\n\nMy mom blanked me for several days before saying she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d the new baby wasn\u2019t bringing my sister and I closer. She \u201ccouldn\u2019t understand why I couldn\u2019t just be happy\u201d and she \u201cwasn\u2019t going to stop posting happy things just because I was upset.\u201d\n\nMy sister also didn\u2019t understand. She accused me of being jealous. Both her and my mom, on a few occasions, said, \u201cyou lost a daughter but we lost a niece\u201d, which I took to mean that they also suffered a terrible loss but were handling it better than I was.\n\nI felt angry and misunderstood by their reactions. We all argued to the point where we stopped talking to each other. I wasn\u2019t there for my sister during her pregnancy or for the first six months of my niece\u2019s life. I take full responsibility for this. I was hurt and couldn\u2019t process that enough to remember my role as an Aunt. My sister and I eventually patched things together, albeit shakily. She has a healthy baby girl and I try to be a good Aunt from afar!\n\nSix months ago my sister said she started a Stillbirth Charity and asked me to write about my experience for the website. I felt uncomfortable and took several days to think. Eventually I wrote her back and said I didn\u2019t feel comfortable writing my story because so much of my experience was tainted by our family\u2019s reactions, including hers. She got angry and asked whether I would write my story if it wasn\u2019t her asking. She said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that I wouldn\u2019t support her. I told her that I felt like I was in a good place and didn\u2019t want to open it all back up again.

I hope you go NC", "I'm going to reply to all of you individually but I also want to say how enormously grateful I am for your responses. I want to admit that some of the details of this post have been changed because I was terrified of my family finding it and somehow identifying me, but now I hope they stumble across it. I've never felt so validated by so many people. \n\nEven when I was in therapy for this, I always had doubts in the back of my mind like, 'Have I told this story fairly? Have I given enough of their side? What if my therapist secretly thinks I'm a dick but doesn't want to tell me because of the sensitive nature?' I have been through enough therapy that I recognise these as intrusive thoughts, but I've also lived years and years with a family that has weaponised my mental health against me and never ever recognised or praised my recovery (2 years sober), or my efforts to better myself in therapy (honestly, years of it, starting when I was a teenager when I paid for it with my own money.)\n\nI am in a much better place, and I am no contact with my mom and very very low contact with my sister (still keep a degree of contact to keep my relationship with my Niece). My little family I have built overseas is a big part of my strength. For anyone who has gone no/low contact with their family of origin, I'm sure you understand that sometimes there is nagging guilt or doubt. I still sometimes wonder if my choices are justified, especially since my sister continues to be close with my parents. Because of word count limit, I couldn't include the part where my Dad came to visit me in the months after my daughters death. I was still in a very bad place. He went home and told everyone I was rude and ungrateful and that he would think twice before visiting me again. \n\nAnyway, I could write a novel about my original family, but instead I will focus on all of you lovely people. You really have peeled the last few layers back from my eyes about the abuse I suffered and you've bolstered my confidence in focusing on building the family I always wanted and treating my kids with the respect and honour they deserve. \n\nThank you.", "NTA you need some space and some safe people. I'm so sorry for your heartbreaking loss. Go gently with yourself", "NTA.  Oh my dear, go NC.  Your sister and you mother's reactions are just utterly indefensible.  Surround yourself with kind people who treat you with empathy and respect.  They don't qualify.", "NTA\n\nYou were in a vulnerable place and knew that what you were feeling didn\u2019t make sense (reason rarely overrides emotions), and wanted to avoid hurting your sister by saying something you knew you\u2019d regret later. It sounds to me like you made he right choice, especially with how they reacted to you doing that.\n\nNow she is asking you to re-open the wound and pour out your soul. You can either say no (a perfectly good answer), say yes and lie in what you write so you don\u2019t hurt their feelings (I don\u2019t think lying is a good choice, because others are going to read this to try to help them understand what they\u2019re feeling in the same situation), or you say yes and tell the truth.\n\nIf you say yes and tell the truth, you are putting yourself back into the same emotional position as before and basically torturing yourself in an attempt to help other people, and then one of two things is likely to happen. Either your family finally understands what you went through and how you were trying your best, or they take offence to what you say and make you feel like shit, then likely won\u2019t use what you wrote (wasting your time and the pain you\u2019d open yourself up to again).\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want to flip that coin, and instead say no. Even if they had acted reasonably, it\u2019s still ok to say no because you don\u2019t want to actively dig through those memories and relive the full weight of your grief again.\n\nHowever, your sister is definitely TA, prioritising her having a story vs your well-being.", "NTA", "Ugh. \"What about me? I lost a grandchild!\" is what my grandmother said to my mum after her late-stage miscarriage, or, what they didn't say back then but do say now, a stillbirth. I'm sorry anyone said anything like that to you.\n\nNTA. I wouldn't have anything to do with those selfish people.", "Thank you. I admit I'm not as flabbergasted.

I am no contact with my mom and very low contact with sister and dad.", "They haven\u2019t just not been very supportive.

I really want to believe that she does care for me, and I think that she does on some levels, but her selfishness clouds some of that.", "Thank you so much. Your words are very soothing. I also questioned her intentions but was met with immediate anger, like I had no right to question why she is trying to adopt this particular trauma.", "Thank you. She's always been like this. She's not a bad person, but her self-absorption causes a lot of friction.", "I felt the same apprehension. Immediately. I don't know about her non-profit experience, I'm not very involved in her life. For years and years, I would pick up a hobby or interest and within months she was 'suddenly' also interested and doing it so much better (she's been able to navigate our shared trauma in a way that doesn't seem to impede her.) In her opinion, she DID experience stillbirth. I could never make her nor my mom understand how different it was to carry my child, feel her move inside me, carry her after she died, and still give birth to her. I never felt able to say that my grief was infinitely more intense/different than theirs.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. Happy to talk in DM's if you ever need. When I went to support groups, they always used to say it was the 'club nobody ever wants to belong to'. It can be very isolating to lose babies/children and I really hope you've found support and peace.", "Thank you. Felt a twinge of sadness at the word 'bully', as I've always felt bullied by my family, but was always told I was playing victim or being antagonistic. I'm the only child that has had extensive therapy, confronted my parents about their abuse, and laid proper solid boundaries over the years, and because of that, I'm the 'difficult' one.", "You must be very kind to interpret the sister\u2019s actions in that way:-). That didn\u2019t occur to me at all. I assumed the sister was doing it to torture OP. I think I\u2019m right, though, unfortunately", "Thank you for your compassion. I think you're right on some level. I don't like to think she's doing this solely to get to me, although some of her behaviour over the years has been incredible selfish. And you're right, her reaction to my boundary setting says a lot.", "When she first asked me, I tried to clarify her intentions for starting the charity. She was offended that I even asked, so I dropped the subject. I had suspicions it was borne of her need to absolve some of the guilt she felt over how it was handled, but this assumption is also giving her benefit of the doubt, and assuming she was capable of empathy.", "Thank you. After many years of therapy, I'm still learning just how dysfunctional my birth family was/is and every year that passes I feel a bit more comfortable with/justified in my decision to go no/very low contact with all of them.", "Thank you for reminding me. I agree. My self-made family is my focus, as is my personal development. I am permanently scarred, but there is room to thrive in trauma.", "Nice idea! This was something I struggled massively with: I had such conflicting feelings. I was so so happy and excited, but there was also this sickening darkness, this reminder of how badly I wanted the perfect pregnancy, fearless birth, and living child at the end of it. I felt like I was only every allowed to be happy, and that any other feelings I had were wrong. Thank you.", "I prefer to think that she started it for attention, rather than an actual targeted attack, because I honestly can't really fathom why someone would be so evil.

I felt a new depth of sadness when they said that. I knew in my gut that it was wrong, that grief should never be compared like that, but at the time I didn't have the strength or the words to express that to them. I did try and introduce the 'circles of grief' concept to them, but to no avail. \n\nThere is a long history of my sister making decisions expecting a very specific reaction from people, and getting pissed when they don't play along with her narrative. I want to clarify that ultimately she's not a horrible person. I think she's lacking a certain depth of self-awareness.", "Thank you so much for your kind words.", "Feeling grateful for all the kind and empathetic strangers in this post.

You have a lot of wisdom to share. \nAfter my daughter's birth I wrote a whole birth story to share with people who wanted to read it.

Thank you.", "She has chosen to take offence to you not wanting to relive the grief (she is more concerned about how it would benefit her), but you aren\u2019t required to care that she is offended by it.\n\nI suggest you ask yourself if your relationship with her and your mother is akin to a relationship on a reality TV show (I suspect this is not the first time your sister wanted something minor for her that would cost you a lot, and your mother sided with her). If yes, do you really want all that conflict and drama in your life, if it\u2019s the cost of having a relationship with them? Only you have the context to answer the first question, and only you have the right to answer the second.", "NTA. If your sister actually accused you of being jealous, when you lost your baby, that's very unempathetic of her. Maybe she said this in response if you actually accused her of getting pregnant to spite you... But still. \n\nShe should respect your decision not to want to open that wound up again. Everybody wants people talking openly about things as the way to go now, but some people don't want to and they should have the choice. Especially when it comes to writing it on a website. But maybe this was your sister's way of getting to speak to you about it?\n\nMaybe when they said 'you lost a baby, we lost a neice' that indicates they might be putting the affection they had for your baby into this other one, and they are suggesting you do the same. (Probably in a bit of ignorance about the grieving process, and perhaps never having been through stillbirth themselves) I think you're right and they just don't know how to handle it in a way that helps you.

All this to say that them making that statement about \u201cwe lost a niece\u201d is a cop out and infuriating. Losing a niece is terribly painful, but I can\u2019t imagine the pain of being a mother losing a child. I\u2019m so sorry, OP.", "It\u2019s easy to sit up here on my high horse judging people but your sister\u2019s comment almost made me fall off. \n\n\nI don\u2019t want you to lose contact with your niece but if your sister keeps pushing and you ever feel up to it perhaps you could write about the events that occurred after in a polite but sadistic tone. \n\n\nTalk about how when you were grieving your family wasn\u2019t able to offer you support. In their words\u2026.you didn\u2019t understand how hard it was on them to lose a niece. I\u2019m talking total passive aggressive this was my experience with my family. How when she started this charity she was upset you would not support her by writing about your loss. How she thought you would write it for someone else and disregarded your actual hurt of opening old wounds. Dig deep into your memory and check you text messages to quote both her and your mother. \n\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to give it to her but maybe it will help you see your sister for who she truly is. \n\n\nBut you should give it to her\u2026\u2026", "NTA. I am so so sorry for your loss. \n\nYou sound like a very mature and conscientious person. I hope you get the chance to be a mother in some form. Having worked through trauma, learned to take responsibility for yourself; to process and communicate - you will be a fantastic parent, and I\u2019m sorry that your own mum is not one. She sounds like she wants to be angry or offended. To make you feel like a bad person for having naturally mixed emotions. Either she is not very intelligent or deliberately oversimplifies. Either way it must be infuriating. Likewise your sister starting a still birth charity seems bizarre when she could not even support her own sister. \n\nDo not rely on these people for validation. You deserve so much better than them.", "NTA. YOU OWE HER NOTHING! This tragic experience you had is yours to feel and grieve. If you want to share it you should only do it in your time.", "As someone who has also had a late term stillbirth (baby girl born in 2014 at 40 weeks gestation), you're NTA. Your mother and sister are. I'm so sorry for your loss. It's a club nobody should have to be a part of.", "Agreed something seems really off about this...\n\nThe mom and sister seemed to treat op's still birth as a annoyance to them, but now all of a sudden it has impacted the sister so greatly she wants to start a charity? She's definitely up to something, there were multiple instances where she could have helped her sister but choose to make it absolutely and completely about her self!!\n\nThis might just be me but I took the statement of \"you lost a daughter but we lost niece\" very very differently than op, to me that was a gut punch because it insinuates that they suffered a greater loss than op, or that the loss they suffered was equal to the loss op suffered.\n\nNo contact is tho only way forward, but she also needs to document that she is not in ay way affiliated with this charity, op needs to document that she told the sister she wants nothing to do with it, because I can 100% guarantee the sister is going to steal her story and post it as her own.", "Would like to add that you don\u2019t ever have to add the why to things like this. \u201cNo thank you\u201d is sufficient, even if it will make others frustrated. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable at this time\u201d is also ok. I find that when I offer up a reason, I\u2019m hoping people will understand. Sometimes they do, but especially when they haven\u2019t shown willingness or capacity to understand, the why gives them something to debate. You are absolutely NTA. Grief is complex and I commend you for taking care of yourself and being self aware.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss- I\u2019ve been through it too. I can\u2019t imagine how it would feel if my family tried to take on my own living hell to make themselves look good. Yes, the loss of a child is indeed felt by the whole family, but it\u2019s not the same as what the parents go through. I\u2019m betting (based on your other comment about how your sister needs everyone to follow her narrative) that she is founding this organization in honor of your daughter, and expects a heartfelt note from you to post on the website, and when you refused, it ruined her entire plan."]}
