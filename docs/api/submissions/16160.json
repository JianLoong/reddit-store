When we spoke to the airline we specifically said not to book bulkhead seats because the seat dividers don\u2019t move and so there is less space (if we lift the dividers up then our child can lay across our laps to sleep.)\n\nWell when we checked in guess where they seated us? We spent the 2 days before the flight going back and forth with the airline on the phone but basically got fobbed off being told that the system allocated us there.\n\nWhen we got to the airport it was the same thing and they told us to ask the people in the row behind if they would switch.\n\nSo when we boarded we did. It was 3 friends and they were all happy to do so as they got extra legroom. Child fell asleep like 10 minutes after takeoff and we slept through the whole flight.\n\nI was talking to my cousin about our flight and she said we were really inconsiderate and committed a huge faux pas. I know it\u2019s shitty to force someone to move but in our situation the airline literally told us to ask and if the other passengers had refused we would have just dealt with our child being awake for the 8hour flight\n\nAre we still AHs for asking at all?", "created_utc": 1682969632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134ywtw/aita_for_asking_to_switch_seats_with_someone_on_a/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You offered them what most people \\*not\\* hauling around a baby would consider an upgrade.  Not demanded, offered!  If for whatever odd reason they really needed to stay in the seats they were in, they had the ability to say so.", "NTA for asking politely. \n\nAnd you got lucky that people were willing to switch. And they would have been NTA if they hadn't wanted to move. \n\nThe customer service has truly disappeared from airline service.", "As a general rule of thumb, there is never any problem in politely asking someone for a favor. NTA, at all.

Your cousin is a weird breed", "NTA you gave them an upgrade, that's always reasonable", "NTA. If you were willing to take no for an answer, sure, ask away.

The 3 friends agreed and moved together so all you did was switch row a with someone willing. It's ok to ask - but if they'd said no and you were willing to accept that I don't see any problem.", "NTA. You asked them to move seats, you didn\u2019t demand.

It sounds like you took the freebie route of waiting for the airline to assign you?", "NTA. How on earth is it inconsiderate to politely ask people to switch to seats with more legroom? You didn\u2019t force anyone to do anything. Your cousin\u2019s an idiot.", " NTA. It\u2019s fine to ask when the trade would be an upgrade/equal trade for the other party.", "NTA at all - faux pas would be trying to get the more expensive legroom seats after not paying for them. you did the opposite.", "NTA but \u201casking the airline\u201d is not the same as paying to choose your seats, so if you actually have specific seating wants, you should start to pay in advance to reserve the type of seats you want and refrain from bothering other passengers. Because what you have described is a want, not a need, and it is obnoxious to expect others to inconvenience themselves in the moment to deal with your wants when you could have just booked in advance.", "Nta you traded better seats- aka more leg room- for less good seats.  \n\nYou also didn't insist or pitch a fit.", "NTA, like, at all.

You'd only be an AH if they declined and then you kicked up a fuss and tried to force them out of their seats.", "NTA I think the big difference in this situation is you politely asked they where happy to oblige.\n\nOn this case everyone benefited from the change of seats. Your family do to the fact your child layed across you and slept the other because they got more leg room. This was a win win situation.\n\nNow if you asked and they said no and you where rude or harassed them then you be the ass hole", "NTA. It's totally fine to ask. It's not ok to try to pressure people. They say \"no\", you say \"ok\".\n\nThe flight attendant should have helped you ask, IMHO.", "NTA for asking and it seemed they were pleased with the trade. It\u2019s only rude if the other party says no and you proceed to throw a fit.", "NTA - anyone can ask, but don't be angry if someone says no.", "As a frequent traveler, absolutely NTA for asking politely.

Your decision to have kids should not inconvenience others", "NTA\n\n\nYou didn\u2019t ask your cousin to move. You asked a couple of strangers who were willing to shift. Your cousin wasn\u2019t there. \n\n\nThe only scenario where you would have been an AH would be if you had asked the people if they could shift, they said no, and you still badgered them into moving. Since thats not what happened, you are good.", "NTA.  You asked, they accepted.", "NTA for asking, but they also wouldn\u2019t have been for refusing had they chosen to do so.", "NAH, but which airline are you using that doesn't allow you to select your seats?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with simply asking someone to switch seats, as long as your reaction to being told \"no\" would be/is \"ok thanks anyways\" and accepting your crappy seating.", "NTA If the people were more than happy to switch seats because it was better for them legroom wise then what's the problem? It sounds like a win win to me.", "NTA. If you have a legitimate reason to ask someone to switch seats, and it isn't an inconvenience for them (ie don't be asking someone to give up their window for your middle, or their exit row with extra leg room for you normal row), then there's no issue. Having said that, if they decline, they are well within their rights.\n\nSociety needs to work together, and asking someone for a small favour should never be considered an AH thing", "NTA. Also you were trading equal if not better seats. You weren\u2019t asking someone with a window to switch with a middle or asking someone to take a downgrade. You did everything correctly.", "NTA Absolutely fine to ask. What causes problems is when entitled folk don\u2019t take no for an answer or try and guilt trip you or keep nagging or being downright nasty if they don\u2019t get their own way. \n\nI\u2019ve switched seats for people, I\u2019ve also said no. I never mind anyone asking as long as they respect the answer.", "NTA. You\u2019re always in the right to ask, if they refuse it\u2019s too bad, but they agreed and it sounded like a fair trade.", "NTA  I don't think it's rude to ask especially if you explain yourself and your situation.   You had no issues with swapping seats so that's great.  If you'd been rude when they refused, then it would be a problem.  But you can't know if you don't ask...humbly.", "NTA\n\nYou did what you could, sounds like your airline messed up and the other passengers had no issue with it. All in the clear OP", "It's only shitty when you don't accept \"no\" for an answer. \n\nAnd to preface all the people saying \"you should have paid more, you should have booked early\" blah blah, sometimes because life is first come first serve, the seats you need are booked and there are no other flights,  and you have to hope someone is kind enough to switch. \nAnd know that if they aren't, then that will have to be okay too.\n\nEDIT: NTA", "NTA. Seems like everyone was happy in the end.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever rude to ask to switch seats for a valid reason, as long as you are totally cool with a no.

Those two things are both key.", "You're NTA for asking, especially when the seats you were giving up in the trade were demonstrably better ones! I would take a bulkhead seat any day.", "NTA. The conflict is when people demand a more expensive seat and have a crap seat. Here, You're offering more room.", "NTA for asking. You'd have been T A if they had said no and you pressed the issue with THEM.", "So when we made the original booking we did book just regular seats, because it suited us.\n\nWhen we checked in we found that the system, such as it is, changed the seats for us and nobody was able to change it back\n\nWe travel a lot so if it\u2019s going to be an issue going forward we will definitely be looking into other airlines", "Exactly.", "People just flat out gotta stop asking people to switch seats.  Sit down,\nshut up, let the crew do it\u2019s job then get off the plane.  Flying would be so much easier if people weren't so damn entitled", "I didn\u2019t force anyone. All I meant by that sentence is that if we had pushed I totally understand why we would be TA. I didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with asking but my cousin did, hence asking", "They gave the whole plane an upgrade, because by asking for the switch they made it so their toddler could sleep instead of having hours of screaming meltdowns that *everyone* would have had to endure! \n\nVery reasonable, indeed.", "Neither am I, that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking here!

Nothing wrong with asking.", "Right they automatically assign the under two next to the parent.  So you buy the two adult seats and they put the under two with you.", "NTA.

Whenever I have travelled, I buy a seat for my children and myself. I pay for out seats. There has never been a requirement for bulkhead seats.

They have never been a lap held infant.", "I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re not understanding?

When you booked and paid for three seats, did they assign you seats as part of your transaction?  \n\nIf you had the option to PAY and select your seats at booking and you chose to have the airline assign them to avoid paying the seat selection fee, you assumed the risk and were arguably an AH for making it someone else\u2019s problem. \n\nIf you are on some airline that doesn\u2019t allow you to purchase and pay for a seat, but to make requests (?) and assign you things without your having a choice to pay to make sure you have what you need (which would be a strange and unique business model)\u2026 it sounds like there was no other option for you other than to not have your child lay down or to ask someone for the favor.", "What underlying issue? I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying here\n\nI already said we paid to choose our own seats, which were \u2018regular\u2019 seats as opposed to \u2018extra legroom\u2019 seats, so that we could ensure our whole family would sleep the night through.\n\nThen the online system changed the seats to ones we didn\u2019t want i.e. the bulkhead row"]}
