We spent the 2 days before the flight going back and forth with the airline on the phone but basically got fobbed off being told that the system allocated us there.\n\nWhen we got to the airport it was the same thing and they told us to ask the people in the row behind if they would switch.\n\nSo when we boarded we did. It was 3 friends and they were all happy to do so as they got extra legroom. Child fell asleep like 10 minutes after takeoff and we slept through the whole flight.\n\nI was talking to my cousin about our flight and she said we were really inconsiderate and committed a huge faux pas. I know it\u2019s shitty to force someone to move but in our situation the airline literally told us to ask and if the other passengers had refused we would have just dealt with our child being awake for the 8hour flight\n\nAre we still AHs for asking at all?", "created_utc": 1682969632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134ywtw/aita_for_asking_to_switch_seats_with_someone_on_a/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they agree, then great.\n\nIf they say no and you keep asking and insisting on it, you're an ass. \n\nSo im short, you're NTA.", "Most people would pay extra to get bulkhead seats, so I bet those people thought you did them a favor. if your offer gives someone better seats, I say ask away.\n\nIf you could have chosen the seats you needed if you\u2019d paid extra, but didn\u2019t want to pay and decided to take your chances, you\u2019ll likely annoy people who know,you\u2019re in that situation because you thought saving money was more important than knowing you\u2019d have the seats you needed.", "NTA for asking to switch no faux pax her.  NOW asking and beingsnotty if the person refuses would be a one way flight to Aholeville, LOL.", "NTA \n\nAsking is fine as long as you're not a jerk about it.", "NTA. It\u2019s fine to ask as long as you\u2019re polite and accept the answer you get no, ifs ands or buts", "NTA.\n\nThe only reason AiTA and I guess the reason it exists matters is for people like your cousin to understand how proper communication can navigate potentially uncomfortable situations. Your situation seems completely reasonable. Both parties agreed. \n\nI can kiiiiiiiiiind of see where your cousin is coming from if there is some reason that the presence of your baby was enough to coerce others into changing for that reason alone, but they got more leg room. I could see myself agreeing to swap even if I didn't really want to, but I also am 6'1 so would jump for more legroom on a flight. But even if the legroom wasn't a thing, I don't see you as being an AH either, just that I can get why some people might initially be put off by a request. \n\nIn this case, your cousin should realize that it's dumb to not break a social faux pas (not saying this is one but if she thinks it is) in situations that everyone involved ends up being more satisfied than before.", "I was gonna say AH just based on the initial info but if you asked them politely to move and they did and they got more leg room, absolutely NTA.", "You were offering a better deal for them for a better deal for you. NTA and I'm sure they were happy to sit there.", "NTA . It's never a faux pas to ask politely. It is an AH move, though, to not accept their 'No' if they don't want to move. You asked nicely, they said yes and both parties got what they wanted. No harm, no foul.", "I'm assuming you would have taken no for an answer, but you literally had no other option.\n\nAlso, I would bet a lot of money that eeeeeveryone else on the plane was grateful that your baby slept through the flight instead of wailing inconsolably for 8 hours.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s only rude if you\u2019re expecting someone to give up their aisle for your middle or if you were insistent after they said no. You did great.", "NTA for asking. It\u2019s the people who insist, demand, complain that are.", "NTA but the people you asked would have every right to say no if they wanted to and additionally, you should have booked/paid for assigned seating when you booked your flights to guarantee you were sitting where you wanted. No fault on the airline here.", "I operate under the it's not rude to ask to exchange \\*better\\* seats for lesser seats if done politely rule, and backing off quickly if they are not interested.  But that is extremely rare--usually you get entitled people from the back of the plane or a middle seat wanting your aisle seat up at the front of the plane.  Nope.  You made someone happy with better seats, so NTA.", "NTA.   \nYou gave the upgrade to the people who swapped with you, and they were happy to accept.   \nYou can always ask. And if they say no you accept that gracefully and sit down in your assigned seat. And where ever you can you make that attractive to the other party (usually by offering to take a lesser quality seat).   \n\n\nAll these posts about people and airline seats are generally from someone who has the shittiest seat on the plane wanting a better one\u2026 or a situation where the swap is something they could resolve another way. Neither applies to you.", "Asking? No. \n\nInsisting or complaining would make you the AH, but that\u2019s not what happened. \n\nPro tip: don\u2019t travel with your cousin. \n\nNTA", "Bulkhead seats? You could have auctioned them off to the highest bidder.", "NTA. Its ok to ask. Never ok to demand or be pushy. Like seats for like seats is a fair trade. Too easy. It's not like you tried going from economy to business or comfort class.", "NTA, does your cousin understand what bulkhead seats are?", "NTA. Your cousin is wrong. Both your family and the friends enjoyed a win-win.", "I\u2019m a frequent flier, and you are nta. I try to accommodate anyone, especially with kids, if they need to change seats (and we\u2019re in the same section). Recently, I flew 8.5 hours to the UK, and I was seated in between a mother and a daughter. I asked them several times if they wanted to switch the seating arrangement, and they always said no. They really prefer aisle seats and booked the flight that way on purpose. Anyhow, flying is stressful (imo) especially if you are a solo woman flyer or have kids. Since I see so many stressed out people on flights, I try to offer as much grace and niceties as possible. I\u2019m glad your little one got a nap and you guys got one too. Sounds like everything worked out in the end!", "The other passengers were nice to switch and you weren\u2019t the butthole for asking. However, you need to pay for the seats you want, so your daughter can  sleep and no one will be annoyed by her crankiness if other passengers do not want to switch seats.", "Lol.\n\nNTA for asking.\n\nYour cousin is weird.\n\nThe basis of seat switching is usually: \nIf you are trading good seats with normal seats -> most people are ok.\nIf you are trading shit seats for good/normal seats -> you can ask but most people will say no.\n\nIf you ask and people say no, and you insist on it -> you are the ah..\n\nIf you ask and people say no, and you just stay put where you are -> no one sucks.", "NTA your cousin, who wasn't there and didn't witness any of this, has no idea what she's talking about.  The bulkhead seats have MORE legroom.  Your friends were happy to switch with you after you asked.  You made no demands, and everyone was happy.  Your cousin sounds like one of those people who has to find something to argue or complain about no matter what.", "Wrong gender and wrong scenario. I see you didn\u2019t read the whole thing or check the clarifying comments that have been here for hours x", "Are you lost? What \"each kid\"?", "Well yeah, if they said no it would have sucked but we would\u2019ve just dealt with it\n\nI packed a lot of toys in the hand luggage just in case lol \n\n(After a full day of tiring him out at the park I know I was also very glad to get a good sleep on the flight too!)", "As I said in the post and in comments we paid extra in the initial booking to book the seats we wanted. Airline rep confirmed we had those seats. It was only after we checked in online that they changed the seats and the whole palaver began.", "Thank you!", "This is how you know they didn\u2019t fly spirit. That would cause a gunfight on a spirit air flight.", "What are bulkhead seats? And NTA OP since you were willing to accept the outcome either way.", "Haha maybe we flew the same route!\n\nHusband and I have also been frequent travellers since we were young so we try to extend a little patience to other passengers because, like you said, travel is stressful enough without any additional annoying things happening!\n\nThe guys who switched with us were also very nice about it and I think enjoyed being able to stretch out although I was asleep most of the flight so I don\u2019t know precisely \ud83d\ude02", "Bulkhead seats are usually listed as \u201cpremium\u201d due to the extra leg room, and airlines charge more for them.", "What clarifying comments? When you book a flight you can buy the seats you want. You declined.", "southwest is free seating. you cant pick them in advance but you're also not assigned them", "Okay I wasn\u2019t sure if you paid for it or just \u201crequested\u201d it but that is frustrating and agree with the other comments that the airline should have tried to accommodate better as you did pay for it.", "You\u2019re being sarcastic right? Nobody has guns on a plane right?", "You may have been given that seat because the bulkheads accommodate the bassinet. Did you pay for a separate seat for the 1 year old? The airline may have been not only trying to help you, but the bassinet is a safer way to secure a baby during the flight. And the bassinet is amazing for parents who have to hold the child through the flight.", "Your flying experience will be better if both parents can sit with their child. That\u2019s a no brained\n\nAny other switch I\u2019m with ya", "The seats at the front of a cabin which typically have a significantly bigger amount of space in front of them", "No I didn\u2019t lol. \n\nPls read the comments which address your claim before you make a statement about what I did or did not do, thanks", "Correct. But spirit airlines boarding process is horrible and their seat changing policy lacks any semblance of common sense. Resulting in angry people yelling at each other or the flight attendants the two times I was unlucky enough to have to fly with them.", "Yes, paid for a separate seat and paid extra to be able to choose our seats when we initially booked. Child has been too big for the bassinet since he was 4 1/2 months hence we always get him a seat.", "Those bassinets have a weight/size limit and most of them seem to be for babies under a year old, some as low as six months, or around 20 pounds. Some go up to 18 months, tbf, but a lot are only for quite small babies.", "I do not think she paid for the seats. I think she made a request.", "Like I said in other comments, the rep who confirmed our booking told us they\u2019d given us the seats we wanted. It was that way right up until we checked in. At that point suddenly we were shifted to the bulkhead and despite days of trying to get it changed back the airline\u2019s advice boiled down to \u201cwell just ask your seat neighbour\u2019s to switch once you board.\u201d \n\nHope that clears things up for you", "Oh thank goodness\n\nThat sucks though. I\u2019ve found in general airline processes have been in shambles since the lockdown and it does seem to be making things more stressful for passengers worldwide", "I have had my selected seat changed last minute on a flight before. It was fine, I was switched from one window to another."]}
