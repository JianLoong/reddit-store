We spent the 2 days before the flight going back and forth with the airline on the phone but basically got fobbed off being told that the system allocated us there.\n\nWhen we got to the airport it was the same thing and they told us to ask the people in the row behind if they would switch.\n\nSo when we boarded we did. It was 3 friends and they were all happy to do so as they got extra legroom. Child fell asleep like 10 minutes after takeoff and we slept through the whole flight.\n\nI was talking to my cousin about our flight and she said we were really inconsiderate and committed a huge faux pas. I know it\u2019s shitty to force someone to move but in our situation the airline literally told us to ask and if the other passengers had refused we would have just dealt with our child being awake for the 8hour flight\n\nAre we still AHs for asking at all?", "created_utc": 1682969632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/134ywtw/aita_for_asking_to_switch_seats_with_someone_on_a/", "score": 708, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
