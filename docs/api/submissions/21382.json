Really you yelled at him because he was being an abusive drunk asshole. That type of behaviour is unacceptable, and scary. Trying to justify things with his grandfathers death is soooo toxic. His behaviour sounds like something a proud boys member would do.\n\nMy advice, get out of that relationship ASAP.", "Tbh the dude will probably blow up a bunch of his fingers before he gets violent and you can\u2019t really punch with just a thumb", "It\u2019s one thing as an adult to make dumb decisions, like setting off fireworks while drunk, but he\u2019s risking the safety of their child as well. I would be absolutely fuming over his irresponsibility. I would be taking the kid and running.", "I don't know, I guess because all his friends do the same things and he makes me feel like I'm just being paranoid.

That's legitimately *never* going to be the case unless he's a full blown alcoholic with DTs so bad he can't hold his hands steady and can't keep the mortars pointed away from people.

I drive better when I'm drunk...AND faster!\"", "This sounds like the most likely possibility.  He sounds pretty abusive."]}
