I don't want her to have kids thinking that she has a default babysitter in me. Babysitting a kid is a whole different level of work.\n\nShe got mad at me because she says I'm \"taunting\" her about her infertility. Which I didn't even freaking know she has. My mom told me my sister had a miscarriage a few years ago. But that's all I knew. I didn't know whether or not they were still planning on having kids and it's obviously none of my business, so I said \"if.\" She also gets mad at my mom for pressuring her to have kids. So I feel like it was a no-win situation and she'd be mad even if I said \"when\" too.\n\nShould I have said \"when\" or should I have just said nothing at all? Or maybe I should've just shut up and taken care of the dog without protest. AITA for \"if\"?\n\nEdit: I should add, she's upset I used the word \"if\". She said that I should know she's having kids because she's tried and that I shouldn't think she isn't going to have kids just because she hasn't yet. She went on to call what I said \"taunting.\"\n\n*Since a lot of people are asking, my reason for saying this in the first place was because her best friend and friend's husband (that they're going on this trip with) have two kids that they usually send to stay with her parents or her brother, who is my age.

She wasn't asking you to babysit future kids, she was asking you to dog sit (which you can turn down, if you want to.)  Why would you just assume that she would be the sort of person who would try to drop off their kids with no notice?  That's essentially accusing her of being an inconsiderate and rude person.  \n\nHer, because I don't think you're an asshole for saying \"if\" I think she is reading too much into that.  No one knows the future.  Everything is an \"if.\"", "YTA - this was a petty thing to say. If you don\u2019t appreciate how she asked you to watch her dog, tell her *that*", "YTA - She never even mentioned to you about babysitting kids so this was out of left field and unnecessary. Not sure why you are so salty about something no one has even asked you to do.", "YTA - yes you didn\u2019t know, but once you did you should have apologized profusely and let it go. Now here you are, the victim of your own careless comment, you never ask women about FUTURE, PROBABLE, MAGIC BALL children. This is one of the reasons. \nAlso do you think the choice or NOT to have children depends on YOU? How self center. If a friend ask you to water their plants while they are away, are you gona ask them also about those future children you have to babysit?", "yta that was an unnecessarily inciteful comment, i don't know what reaction you expected or were hoping for. did you want her to start profusely apologizing and explaining that she'd never do that or something? like jeez calm down you were asked to petsit and that's as deep as it goes\n\nalso, since you already knew she had a miscarriage, you should assume that randomly bringing up concepts re: her having babies in the future could induce anxiety in her", "NAH - it was an unfortunate accident, you didn't know that those words would have such a profound affect on her. Obviously it's understandable that given her history she may be a bit more sensitive about the situation, and I hope that you manage to overcome this situation and continue on your relationship as it ever was", "YTA you were making up a situation to be mad at and stumbled into her infertility issue, that's still on you. Apologize for being insensitive.", "NTA - Just change the \"if\" to \"when\" and move on.  You are not obligated to support her decision to have children, let alone take care of them.", "YTA nothing at all except being honest about how you feel about taking the dog at a moments notice - clearly you have feelings on that. \n\nBringing up kids when you knew she\u2019s been having trouble conceiving is just cruel.", "Honestly, I think YTA for making that comment in the first place. You don't even know if they'd ask you to babysit their kid if they had one, so complaining about it before it's even happened is jumping the gun. Now, if they do have a habit of asking you last minute to dog sit for them and that annoys you, you can politely let them know \"hey guys, I'd prefer more of a notice if you want me to look after your dog from now on. It's disrespectful and irresponsible to ask me last-minute.\"", "NTA\n\nIt was a throwaway comment that unfortunately hit a nerve you didn't know was exposed.

Not knowing about the infertility is one thing (though knowing about a previous miscarriage + no current children SHOULD give you some insight to not bring up children carelessly; \"know your audience\" as they say)... however, this topic should never even have come up, and it is your fault that it did. Instead of sitting your sister down and having an adult conversation about how you would prefer more of a head's up before being asked to watch her dog, you instead decided to be passive aggressive and make a nasty comment about a hypothetical situation. Apologize and try civilized communication next time.", "You know you don\u2019t have to say every fucking thought that comes to mind right? She didn\u2019t have kids, she hadn\u2019t said a word about asking you to babysit in future. YTA", "YTA for saying something begrudging at all.

No. YTA.", "You hit a sore spot, say you are sorry and move on. You cross the kid bridge when you get to it.", "YTA for the unnecessary and insensitive comment.

You didn't know she was having infertility problems. So, NTA.", "No. Its not your responsibility", "NTA she cannot berate you and tell you off for making an off hand comment when she has never giving you any pertinent information. You were in a no win situation. She should of told you that any kid talk was off limits.

It stands to reason as people do not change.", "NTA. Obviously you and your sister are not close, and there was no way for you to know.    \n        \nGiven that your sister relies on you for unpaid last minute dog sitting, your comment doesn't strike me as over the top.", "NTA. You had no way of knowing she was sensitive around the topic of kids and accidentally hurt her feelings. She's the AH for insisting you were taunting her on purpose. Your mom is the bigger AH for pressuring your sister so much she snapped at such an innocuous comment. Maybe just be the bigger person and apologize so you can be there for your sister since she's clearly hurting.", "YTA - she didn\u2019t ask you, it is awful arrogant of you to assume they would want you to babysit to begin with.", "ESH. You assumed she was going to do something she had not yet done, AH move. She assumed you had been reading her mind re: fertility and never said anything, then got mad at you when you accidentally reminded her of something you didn't know about. AH move.", "NTA. For gods sake. You didn\u2019t know anything about her ability to have kids and she sounds like she doesn\u2019t either.  You were giving a boundary. At this point.

Otherwise, it does come off the wrong way and out of nowhere, too.", "I get why she's upset, she's hurting,  but it's not your fault. I don't think you were deliberately insensitive. But apologise anyway for the sake of peace. Sometimes it's best to apologise even if you did nothing wrong, to spare the feelings of someone you love. This is one of those times.\n\nNTA of course", "NTA you didn't know", "NTA.  You can't taunt someone about a condition you know nothing about.  Could the phrasing have been better?  Absolutely.  You did inadvertently cause her pain, so be a grown-up and apologize for that.  Just because you aren't T A doesn't mean you don't owe the apology.  And, while I don't think it would be productive to restate your unwillingness to babysit children, good for you for setting those boundaries.", "So, short version is you threw out some random ultimatum for no real reason and it struck a bad nerve.\n\nSometimes when you throw shit at a wall, it sticks. You just learned that.\n\nTo answer your question, yes, YTA, and yes, you should have not said it.", "YTA. \n\nNot sure what has to be explained here. I see your logic but there was nothing alluding to her asking you to watch her \u201cfuture\u201d kids. Seemed like you just wanted to stir the pot in my opinion with an unnecessary comment. If and when she brought up kids and baby sitting if you mentioned it then it\u2019d be a different story.", "YTA this comment was hurtful and unnecessary. I wouldn't let my kids or dog around you.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo she threw a tantrum. Note that she was NOT mad enough to avoid using you as a dogsitter.
