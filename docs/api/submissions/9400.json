But I don't have to wear it and he likes it, and it's not coming off so 'oh, that's cool' and that's the end of it.        \nWe are celtic though, it could be worse!", "I see it often, I just don't mention it.        \nMy friends husband had an ugly scary gargoyle on his chest, when they had kids it scared the babies so he had to keep his shirt on.", "So maybe stop acting in bad faith and assume he's talking from a place of good faith? Its a concept many on reddit don't know about, but it does exist.", "I'm not the one being obtuse if you can't understand there can be a violation of trust when you go around sharing personal relationship issues with others.  \n\nI'm sure if she was upset with the size of his penis and complained about it to her friends and those friends mentioned it to him you could understand the violation of trust. \n\nBut yet that's part of her life so she can do that without issue according to you?", "I mean you can read the OPs post pal, but don't worry, try again and catch up", "You also classed lip filler as plastic surgery... you're just double silly, aren't you? Awwww", "I\u2019m not ruling that out, but my question remains.", "Well I don\u2019t feel the need to control how my husband looks so we work out great, but thanks for the concern :)", "\u201cYou look great\u201d to a person who you know is happy with a change they\u2019ve made and who you love and still want to be with isn\u2019t a lie. If the question was \u201cdo you prefer me with or without filler?\u201d this would be a different conversation. But harshing the mellow of a woman with an immune deficiency who has image issues excited about doing something to her appearance that makes her happy isn\u2019t being a supportive partner.", "Gotta enlighten the socially impared people out there", "Because everyone has preferences in how they want their partner to look and it\u2019s stupid to judge them for it", "Then you would lie and tell them you liked the new look if asked? Because to me that is way worse.  Lying leads to places you don't want to go. He was asked his opinion and gave it, nothing controlling or misogynistic about it.  No where does he say he would have forbade her from doing anything, chill out.", "It does because she literally asked what he thought", "I've wanted to use his line for years cause my inspiration was the SouthPark movie.", "You mean him stating he has preferences?.\n\nI have preferences. everyone has preferences. nobody just dates anybody. He didn't try stopping her from doing what she was doing he just told her he didn't like it after. There's nothing wrong with that.", "And look at that someone can't handle an opinion that disagrees with her own\n\nYta", "The point couldn\u2019t have been more simply explained, how are you still missing it haha", "Why does it need to be explicitly stated that OPs girlfriend, who has alopecia and per OPs post has \u201cimage issues\u201d, might have gotten lip filler to help with the image issues she has surrounded herself and feel better in order for you to think it\u2019s relevant?", "I think if you have an autoimmune disease that has physical manifestations of partial or complete baldness and you suffer from insecurities because of it, leading you to seek out other opportunities to boost your confidence, that\u2019s really relevant. Why would it not be?", "Sure, you don\u2019t. But if you actually love your partner and support them, a minor change to their appearance that doesn\u2019t affect you and gives them more self confidence shouldn\u2019t be an issue. If it\u2019s a lie for OP to say \u201cyou look great\u201d then he shouldn\u2019t be with her to begin with.", "yeah you don\u2019t need to brag about being such a good person, it\u2019s pretty cringeworthy to read", "Ok sweetheart", "Damn. That is extremely huge", "A tattoo does not equate to physically changing your face , especially when it's only on your back and not in full view 24/7 . A tattoo can be covered , changing your lips can't . You're also forgetting the main fact that she asked his opinion and he was honest .", "I\u2019m not talking about what he said to his girlfriend. That\u2019s actually not fine at all. \n\nI\u2019m talking about how he describes his relationship to his preferences, which I think it directly related to how he spoke to his girlfriend. Preferences fine, actions and words not fine. Understand now?", "Ok, let\u2019s assume good faith. I, a hypothetical op\u2019s gf have always been insecure about my lips and may have even been bullied for it in highs highschool. So i did something that makes me feel better and more confident, after all these years. I come home and my BF shatters my newfound confidence because he doesn\u2019t like it?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have to love it or lie about it. But a little sensitivity would not have killed him.", "Lol \u201cI\u2019m not being obtuse. Sharing information about genitals is the exact same as lip filler\u201d", "I did. Are you just going to continue being insulting and not actually say anything? Because there\u2019s mods for that. I\u2019ll let them sort you out since insults are all you have to offer.", "Did you already had this attitude in school and still feeling like the hero while doing this bully jokes? \ud83d\ude04 P.S. i really don't want to have an answer.", "You were already given a tactful and honest example. You don\u2019t have to say everything you think, exactly as you think it, and justifying it with \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re NTA.", "Having a preference doesn't make you an asshole it makes you a human. If my girlfriend did something drastic to change her looks I wouldn't be happy about it and I would tell her honestly.", "Then maybe don\u2019t ask if you don\u2019t want an honest opinion? He didn\u2019t try to convince her otherwise. But she asked and he answered truthfully. For a sub so stuck on honest communication y\u2019all are sure against it in this case.", "Telling someone they look great if you don't think they look great is a lie... there's no other way to explain that.", "Yeah. That Fascist needs every woman to be accepted whatever she looks like, but you\u2019re a mutt because you shaved your beard.", "Not really. We judge people for what their preferences are all the time, not just in partners. \n\nAlso, having a preference for something isn\u2019t the same thing as telling your partner that you dislike something they did for themselves to make themselves feel better in relation to their image issue. My partner prefers my hair short. When I grow my hair long because I like it like that, he doesn\u2019t tell me he dislikes it and wants me to cute it short when I ask \u201chow does this look\u201d.", "I\u2019m glad i walked into that one. Look ma i made someone\u2019s day today", "Because OP gf didn't say that. \n\n\nTruthful question: Does OP gf having alopecia have anything to do with this?  \n\nMy point was the person who said \"you should mention she has alopecia\" is saying hey mention her disease so people will sympathize with her more", "He said she has image issues I'm asking why do we need to know she has alopecia?", "Excuse me for joining the conversation in a conversation based website. I've been humbled. I am very apologetic. To you in particular.", "Is that.... supposed to.... do you think..... BAHAAAAA!!!! Jfc.     \nYou're hilarious,  but not in the way you think you are.", "Yep. If it was something he put thought into it could have been awesome but his thought process went 'want a tattoo, make appointment, go in shop, ummmm that! All over my back k thnx'", "Don't ask a question if you're not prepared for an honest answer.", "It can be anything he does to make himself feel better.   Hair plugs, getting a third nipple removed, staying anxiety medication.  It doesn't matter, if your partner has been vulnerable to you in a way they are not with others it is a violation of trust to them share that with others.", "If OP doesn\u2019t think his girlfriend looks great because she got some lip filler, then I can guarantee the relationship was on shaky legs to begin with. If this is \u201cI\u2019m no longer attracted to you\u201d for him, the he should break up so she can be with someone who is excited to see her excited about her image and changes she\u2019s making to feel better about herself. If this isn\u2019t \u201cI\u2019m not longer attracted to you\u201d then OP still thinks she looks great and it\u2019s not a lie. \n\nThis whole \u201cI gotta be 100% honest with my partner all the time otherwise it\u2019s betrayal, even when my honest will hurt them unnecessarily\u201d schtick is weird.", "Getting your lips filled isn\u2019t reversible like getting your hair cut is \n\nAlso your partner prefers your hair short, it doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t like your hair long also. It\u2019s not the same thing as in this case where OP has a boundary about wanting his girl to stay natural\n\nAnd the people who judge others for their preferences are far worse than people like OP. If you have a certain preference and can attain a partner like that, then all the more power to you.", "\ud83d\ude0a", "As someone who suffers from alopecia, I can confidently state that it\u2019s not a huge leap to connect image issues caused by that with trying to compensate for them in other ways e.g. lip fillers. I can\u2019t speak for OP\u2019s gf directly, but it definitely COULD be relevant", "My god man. The point is not for \u201csympathy\u201d. She may not have explicitly said this but it\u2019s likely accurate to her true feelings, honestly the fact she didn\u2019t mention it beforehand to him suggests she fears OP could have talked her out of something she didn\u2019t want to be talked out of and she wanted to have complete control over this. Now please don\u2019t mistake this, I AM NOT saying that OP is controlling and wanted to control this situation and prevent her from doing it. I am simply saying OPs partner feared he could convince her not to go through with it, even if that\u2019s without a shed of controlling behaviour but simply by sharing his opinion. Now this is is where the alopcia is relevant, this is something that OPs partner cannot control about her appearance. Yes there are wigs and such that offer some control here but that doesn\u2019t always fill the hole. Getting her lips done, maybe something else she is self-conscious about, is something about herself she can control, helping to fill that hole left by the alopecia that little bit more. I would bet my last dollar that this is the case here. Not saying OP is the TA I\u2019m not sure which way to sway this one, because while he\u2019s had some questionable choice of words here I don\u2019t think he\u2019s intended to be mean or controlling. \n\nEdit to add I also do not think he should have lied but could have still offered more support.", "Because alopecia is an autoimmune disease that can make people completely or partially bald before they\u2019re 20 years old. Which is a really different type of \u201cimage issue\u201d\nthan feeling overweight or not liking how your boobs look or the size of your nose. It\u2019s an important addition.", "Supposed to what? I said ok?", "Look, there is a lot more to an actual partner than appearance. I prefer men with hair, but if I am with someone and they lose it, it would be a terrible thing to say out loud", "How is getting lip filler being vulnerable to your partner in a way you are not to others? It\u2019s a very visible body modification.", "I never said his relationship was healthy or it should even continue on...  he asked if he was an asshole for not lying and he's not. Lying to your partner is never okay.\n\nThe fact that you're okay with lying to your partner is weird", "Lol do you know how lip filler works? It disappears. You get it dissolved and it disappears and needs to be redone. \n\nYou need to learn what a boundary actually is in a relationship. Hint, it\u2019s a not having a arbitrary standard of \u201cnatural\u201d and telling your partner who struggles with her image that you prefer her the way she was before when she makes a change to give herself confidence.", "Ok, I ask you. \n\nIf your partner was telling this story about not liking something you did yo change your appearance. Do you think you having alopecia should be mentioned if he's wrong for not liking your lip fillers new tattoo etc?", "That would be through no fault of theirs. This is a completely cosmetic  procedure. He's allowed to have preferences and to answer honestly.", "Now you're the one being obtuse.  She shared about her body image issues with him and then he went to friends and bitched about how she looks and they told her, how is that hard to understand she was being vulnerable?", "A boundary is anything you have an issue with. You don\u2019t get to gatekeep what a boundary is and isn\u2019t for somebody. \n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing wrong with being honest. If I decided to gain 30 lbs because I felt like it and asked my partner if they liked my new body and she said she didn\u2019t, that wouldn\u2019t make her an AH for being honest. This idea that you delude yourself and make yourself unhappy by enabling your partner to look a certain way that you genuinely dislike is terrible advice."]}
