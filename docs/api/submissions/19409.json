Supposedly, no matter what she ate, she always hovered around 110lbs. After she had me she put on about 100 more lbs. Growing up my parents never really paid attention to nutrition so we ate whatever and I was an overweight kid. When I was a teenager my mom and I were about the same size. Through high school and into college she would buy duplicates of what she bought clothes wise and give them to me. I would also get a lot of her clothes she didn\u2019t want anymore. As a broke college kid, I was super grateful to not have to buy clothes.\n\nI moved out, only saw my parents about once a month during college and since I started working. I lost about 50-60 lbs in my early to mid twenties when I leaned how to eat better. I\u2019m 29 now, and my mother and I haven\u2019t been the same size for at least 5 years, maybe longer. I\u2019ve tried telling her when she gives me clothes, they don\u2019t fit. We aren\u2019t the same size anymore. Again, trying to be grateful, but I can\u2019t wear them.\n\nMy mother started leaving clothes her size behind at my house like she used to do when she visited my college dorm. I either give them away or return them, sometimes giving her the money back when I see her. She asks why, I remind her they don\u2019t fit me. She insists they\u2019re the right size but she thinks I want to wear too tight of clothes instead. \n\nOn a family trip she made everyone matching t shirts. Hers was an XXL. She made mine an XXL without asking what size I wanted (would be M). In front of my family I first said, \u201cThis won\u2019t fit, do you have one my size?\u201d She replied, \u201cI know you\u2019re a little smaller now, but you can tuck it in.\u201d  A little smaller? I\u2019ve busted my ass to lose weight. I was angry. I told her, \u201cYou aren\u2019t thin like me, I haven\u2019t been overweight in a long f-ing time.\u201d\n\nWell, she lost it crying. Dad\u2019s mad, my uncle\u2019s mad, aunt won\u2019t speak to me. ATIA?\n\nEdit: my mom has tried to lose weight. By that I mean, she\u2019ll pick a fad diet for a few weeks, when she doesn\u2019t see immediate results she quits it. I\u2019ve tried encouraging her. I\u2019ve tried talking to her about it because I want her to live a long time. She just continues to insist diets don\u2019t work and it\u2019s a complete luck of the genetic lottery. I grew up thinking being overweight was gross because my mother would remind me how thin she was as a teenager when I wasn\u2019t, but also thinking I couldn\u2019t change being overweight because she couldn\u2019t lose weight. Also probably worth mentioning I have a younger brother in college who she refers to as fit, strong, and the male version of her at that age - he plays sports and has a naturally high metabolism. He was a chubby kid but not my level of overweight.", "created_utc": 1686351222, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145jgw4/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_isnt_as_thin_as_me/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
