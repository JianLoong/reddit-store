We aren\u2019t sure because she has been very unclear about dates with us. She is obviously heart broken, as we all are. We are trying to help her anyway we can.\n\nShe was at our house a couple days ago doing laundry, they come here instead of a laundromat, and I was helping her. She pulled out a pair of maternity pants and lost it, totally understandable. I asked if she wanted a hug or to be left alone and she sobbed on my shoulder for a good 10-15 minutes.\n\nHere\u2019s where I guess I was an AH:\n\nAfter she calms down she notices she got make up all over my white top and she apologizes for messing up my shirt. I tell her it\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it, it\u2019s not a big deal, I\u2019ll just spray it and toss it in the wash. She says okay and she would like to be alone for a little while. I ask if she wants tea or water and she said no she was just going to finish up and go home for a nap. I\u2019m really trying not to push so I let her know I would be in my office if she needed anything but not to feel rushed out. She said goodbye and left about 30 minutes later.\n\nWhen my husband got home he let me know SD and her fianc\u00e9 are very upset and so was he. Apparently she thought I was talking about the baby when I said it\u2019s okay and not a big deal. Her, her fianc\u00e9, and her sister (16) are not speaking to me and my husband was giving me one word answers when he does talk to me. Step sons (23 & 18) are both just staying out of it.  Hubs is now speaking to me but still thinks I was wrong saying the baby doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nI was talking about the shirt, she was talking about the shirt. I don\u2019t have any children of my own but husband and I lost three trying. All of the kids know this. I would never minimize that what SD is going through but have also made an point of not saying I know how she feels because each experience is different.\n\nI did send her a text (since she won\u2019t answer the phone) letting her know I would never say her baby wasn\u2019t a big deal, that I was just trying to reassure her that the shirt was not a big deal when she apologized for the make up, and that I\u2019m very sorry if I didn\u2019t make that clear in the moment. She called her dad and basically said she can read between the lines and knows what I really meant.\n\nI think everyone is just very emotional and looking for somewhere to direct that emotion, but was I the AH?", "created_utc": 1698859273, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lh8ee/aita_for_something_i_said_while_comforting_my/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why on Earth would she, and everyone else apparently, think you were saying \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d about the baby and not *the very thing she was just apologizing to you about at the time!?*\n\nThe fact that nobody is hearing you out on this sounds alarming. Like I said, grief can make emotions run high but this is pretty unreasonable, you were pretty much put in a lose-lose scenario and are not taking the brunt of everyone\u2019s anger, which is not fair at all.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I did send her a text (since she won\u2019t answer the phone) letting her know I would never say her baby wasn\u2019t a big deal, that I was just trying to reassure her that the shirt was not a big deal when she apologized for the make up, and that I\u2019m very sorry if I didn\u2019t make that clear in the moment. **She called her dad and basically said she can read between the lines and knows what I really meant.**\n\nFeeling anger at a person is more comfortable than feeling the grief. That's what's going on there, imo.", "NTA, but your husband is. Explain to him that while you have total empathy for your step daughter\u2019s situation, you NEVER SAID that the baby didn\u2019t matter or anything like that, and it\u2019s not your fault that SD misinterpreted what you said. You will continue to be kind to her and give her the space she needs, but he needs to give you some more trust and hear out your side of the story in any future conflicts.", "NTA\n\nThat just sounds ridiculous. She \"read between the lines\" of you saying its ok she got makeup on your shirt and decided it was a dig at her for losing her baby?\n\nI get it that she is emotional but that is ridiculous.", "*< She called her dad and basically said she can read between the lines and knows what I really meant. >*\n\nSo she **basically** admits that you WERE talking about the shirt, but that she CHOSE to \"read between the lines\".\n\nAnd then she CHOSE to twist the story and turn people AGAINST you.\n\nNTA\n\nHer, her fianc\u00e9, her sister, your husband, they ALL owe you an apology.\n\nAnd they better make it a sincere one.", "From reading your post, I can completely understand what you meant and what you were referring too. I hesitate to call her an AH due to the circumstances, but probably the emotional weight of what she's dealing with is clouding her judgement a bit. \n\nYou didn't do or say anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nShe's looking for an excuse to let out her anger at someone. You just happened to be a convenient target. Chances are she'll keep trying to pick fights. Don't rise to them. Just be as understanding as possible, and back away.\n\nCan I ask, is she seeking professional help about this? Losing a pregnancy at 5 months can be traumatic both mentally and physically.", "NTA. I understand she\u2019s in a bad situation BUT what they are doing is bullying. Not okay at all. You were so nice towards her.", "I think it\u2019s time your stepdaughter be given the opportunity to find her nearest laundromat, for the foreseeable future. \n\nWhile she is driving back and forth, she can think some more about your relationship and conversation and how much she overreacted to something in her own head. NTA", "Why would everyone assume you would say that? How did this go so sideways? I think your issue is with your husband. Why did he not give you the opportunity to explain the situation? \n\nYou have apologized. If they want to continue to rewrite the story then there\u2019s really nothing more you can do.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Just a misunderstanding. Your SD is obviously in a very emotional state. You\u2019ve apologized and made it clear what u meant. Your husband is being unreasonable. They\u2019ll get over it when they\u2019re ready", "NTA. I am very sad for her loss. She does not, however, get to abuse you in perpetuity. Nor does the rest of your family. While her reaction is somewhat understandable-ish, your husband's is the most worrisome. The silent treatment from anyone is abusive, especially in a marriage. Time for martial counseling. Go alone if he won't go with you. I'm so sorry.", "HARD NTA, but neither is she, the emotional weight of losing a child is heavy as im sure you know since you lost 3. The rest of the family is being kind of stupid though given that they should know you went through the same thing especially your husband. Seems to me you are doing the best you can to be respectful and empathetic.", "NTA I understand how she, in her grief, misinterpreted what you said. But everyone else should take a step back and apply logic here. Your husband doesn't sound too bright in this situation.", "NTA - This is a simple miscommunication.  She is understandably very sensitive at the moment.  As are all parties, no doubt.  \"I'm sorry that I wasn't clear.  It was my shirt that was no big deal because a shirt pales in comparison to the loss you have experienced.  My heart breaks for you, and I'm here for support in any way I can be.\"  You can't make her or your husband come around.  All you can do is communicate and be patient.  By the way, I'm sorry for YOUR losses.  Her miscarriage and yours.", "No good deed goes unpunished.\n\nNTA", "NTA - how could you be the AH?  I think your SD is a child trying to have a child, and she's acting like it.  You have apologized and explained yourself to no avail; at this point, I would just give her space.", "NTA.\n\nYour SD is in a lot of emotional pain and IMO she is simply looking for a place to send her hurt. She is probably trying to deflect her pain by finding any excuse to be angry with you. Hopefully, it won't be too long before she realizes that she misinterpreted what you said. For now, please, you've been in her shoes, so give her some grace.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID, you really, ***really*** need to show this post and the responses to your husband. I can't believe he doesn't have your back on this. I know his instinct is to protect his daughter, but he should understand that now, you're hurting a little bit, too.", "Based off of this, NTA. If this is at all accurate, your husband owes you a serious apology. I get why the kids are acting the way they are but your husband should have the sense to realize what actually happened, especially given your shared past of lost pregnancies. At this point, I think you should remain calm with him for now since this is your stepdaughter's tragedy but you and him are not okay right now. He owes you a sincere apology.", "NTA \n\nEven if she really, truly thought you meant her loss is no big deal (which I find very hard to believe), there's no way (unless you frequently say things for shock value or sheer absurdity) she could legitimately keep thinking that's what you meant when you said \"I'll just spray it and throw it in the wash.\"", "NTA; she literally made this drama up.", "Nta you said its okay, and you would toss it in the wash. CLEARLY, you were talking about the shirt!", "NTA and it's pretty crappy that even your husband is upset with you. Do you all normally get along?", "NTA.  She\u2019s grieving but your husband is the AH here.  He should have let you explain and explained to his daughter what you meant", "NTA\n\nFFS she's upset but obviously you've been very respectful of her emotional state why would you suddenly NOT be. \n\nEither way, they all suck for being so obnoxious to you.", "NTA just a misunderstanding. She\u2019s clearly going through an incredibly sad and confusing time (19 is so young\ud83e\udd7a). You haven\u2019t done anything wrong but can try reaching out and making over the top effort with her so she can understand you\u2019re a trusting and supportive person to continue to come to. I\u2019m sure once things settle from such a heightened emotional state it\u2019ll be easier to communicate the misunderstanding, apologize and move on. Just remember to be the bigger person ALWAYS, she needs people on her side even if it means you apologizing for something not necessarily your fault, it\u2019ll mean a lot to her in the end!", "NTA But do you have a history of putting your foot in your mouth or something? It\u2019s really bizarre that everyone believes you are capable of saying something like that.", "NTA, Your SD needs to see a therapist to help her through her grief. She is projecting it onto you.", "If 99% of your actions were supportive it\u2019s ridiculous that they would pick out a 1% misunderstanding comment and blow it up. This is about their choice to be upset, not an actual misstep on your part.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nThat is absolutely not what you meant or said, and it\u2019s not on you if she\u2019s chosen to interpret it that way. Hopefully, it\u2019s grief clouding her judgement, and with a little time she\u2019ll see this with a clearer head. \n\nSend your husband a text being crystal clear that you meant the shirt and only the shirt. He\u2019s being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't believe you at your word then she is calling you a liar and that is an AH move", "NTA explain your hubby. This is a misunderstanding. She was understandably in grief at moment. Hubby should accept explanation. Family should accept explanation. Maybe needs more explaining. Husband needs to discuss his behavior too. Best of luck....", "NTA. She is overreacting. She is young and going through something traumatic. You know your truth and said your piece. Hopefully she moves on and realizes she isn't thinking straight.", "shes upset and lashing out, nta", "Did Larry David write this?", "NTA. I was an obvious misunderstanding.", "Either you omitted some key details, or your husband and kids have all gone mental out of nowhere.\n\nMy money is on option 1.", "NTA. And when everyone comes down, they will understand that especially when you yourself have suffered such loss. I recommend getting her into some counseling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I understand if you want to be gentle with your stepdaughter but feel free to be mad at your husband.", "Right now her miscarriage is all she thinks about so her mind makes everything about her loss.

Not only for time to process and think about her actions, but to give OP some space from the situation.

But to have the rest of the family dog pile on her too? Yea, no\u2026Not ok. Maybe with a little time to cool her head while at the laundromat instead of OPs house, SD can come to terms with what she\u2019s doing to those around her. \n\nSometimes that space can help you process grief, and all the ugly emotions that go along with it. Hopefully she does see it and talks with OP. Sounds like they have a pretty good relationship overall.", "Agreed.
