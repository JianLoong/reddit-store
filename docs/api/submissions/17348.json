Do you literally just get her jewellery?\n\nSo far I can see why a poetry book isn't a great present for you, but how you are presenting yourself, calling the gift worthless and suggesting it's a gift for herself (it isn't) you come across a bit of a jackass.", "BROOOO i would die if my gf gave me a gift like that! \ud83d\ude2d I get that artsy things aren't for everyone of course, but try thinking of it this way: she put a TON of thought into showing her love for you in a way that's meaningful for how she communicates feelings.

If you\u2019re trying to get them into something you like as well a little, you do it by COMBINING it with their interests, but you make THEIR\u2019S the primary focus. If you loved cooking, a homemade cookbook with family recipes, with a handwritten notes about what the recipes mean to you/your family would be a great way to do this. While it would still be writing in a book(which I also hate, I get it), it would at least be presenting you something YOU like with a touch of something that matters to her.\n\nWhile I think the book of poems and a hand written poem are a beautiful sentiment, and there was certainly a lot of love and effort put in, it sounds like it\u2019s not something that at all caters to your interests and preferences. Which, is completely valid.\n\nI think maybe it was approached wrong with how you told her, but I\u2019m not sure because of how brief that part was. Honestly, there\u2019s no good way to tell someone about this, but being open and honest is important in a relationship.\n\nSo, you\u2019re a little bit of an asshole for it, but it was a bit needed for a healthy relationship going forward.", "YTA.

She put graffiti in it and a poem to you inside.\n\n>and I explained it to her rationally\n\nAARRRRRGH!!!\n\nYou completely missed that the gift was intended to have some sort of spiritual or magical significance. Or sentimental value if you want the secular version. You treated her love talisman like so much toilet paper. Fine, you misjudged her. If you're going to be rational about magic and emotion, I believe you should have humored her at least long enough to treat it like a giant birthday card.\n\n(Edit: And how is expensive jewelry practical and not artsy??? I think a cheap poetry book is plenty practical. Ten years from now who's going to care about a band of pearls or a square shaped roll of toilet paper? But what's written on it, maybe you'll remember, and the toilet paper costs a lot less.)", "You might be acting rationally, but not intelligently. You're reasoning with all your axioms currently of and contained exclusively within your navel.\n\nIf you'd look up for a second, you'd see that there's a person that you (hopefully) care for (not a rational or practical thing), who went out of their way to express how much they care for you. That genuine intent is the only celebration of yourself that you can actually receive. The rest is just a cherry on top.\n\nEdit- forgot, YTA", "YTAShe didn't just give you a book of poems, She gave you words of her heart. Did you even really READ what she wrote? The annotations? And I mean READ them, not just the letters but the love and meaning behind what was written. Sounds like you're refusing to even try and see the meaning behind the words.  If she had written them in a card would you put any more effort into really hearing what she's saying? The love and passion that is being expressed?\n\n\"it was a selfish gift\" No man you're selfish, you CHOOSE to see it as nothing more than \"some book\"  they aren't just poems. they're words of affirmation. Words that are telling you how much you mean to her and you tossed it aside like trash. Poems might not be your thing, but that shouldn't make her words of personal affection worthless yet you treated the as such.\n\nyou don't have to like poems to see the value in what she did but again, you won't even try to see the love behind the words to you they're just trash.  \n\n\nYour also TA for thinking cost has something to do with the quality of the gift \"i get her expensive stuff so a personalized book isn't the same\" quality of a gift doesn't come from  cost.  It's not about how much money you spent on a gift. You buying \"expensive jewelry\" isn't a reflection of how much she means to you.  A gift that comes from the heart, and shows your innermost self is priceless. I'd rather have a heartfelt corny essay of why i am loved than an expensive ring.    \n\n\none of the best gifts i ever got was a two-page birthday \"poem\" my friend wrote me in high school (we wrote joke poems in class all the time) but it wasn't about the fact it was an inside joke, It was a story of some of our best memories, lined with inside jokes and otherwise a reflection of all the things that made us best buds. things that reminded me why we loved each other so much 12 years later i still have it, why? Because when i read it, I smile, I think of all the good times, the happy memories the things that make her my best friend. I love her like a sister to death and that piece of paper means more to me than any physical gift ever could. it's a sill piece of paper, but the love and happiness behind it, is something special a physical gift could never bring.  Money doesn't buy love, money doesn't reflect love.  you buying her expensive jewelry isn't what makes her feel loved.  It's not about costs.", "YTA first off, annotating a book is NOT defacing it. It\u2019s a sign of engagement and appreciation. There\u2019s no better sign of a loved book than someone\u2019s personal annotations. I\u2019d be touched beyond belief if someone gifted me their annotated book. That\u2019s very personal. It\u2019s fine that poetry isn\u2019t necessarily your thing, but the fact that you aren\u2019t touched by the sentiment behind it is a huge red flag. The fact that you actually told her you didn\u2019t like it is an even bigger read flag. I hope she finds someone who does appreciate her.", " ESH. It was the \u2018I liked her because I thought she was practical too\u2019 that got me.\n\nI don\u2019t think you have to like anything that you don\u2019t honestly enjoy. I think you can say thank you for a gift and recognize she meant the intentions behind it to have meaning and kindly let her know the poetry book is lost on you because you have no interest in poetry. You can aknowledge and be gracious for her putting effort into a gift while still letting her know that you have different interests. She doesn\u2019t owe you a gift, no one does, so the gratitude should exist regardless of what it was in my opinion. My issue is the utter disdain you appear to have with anything artistic being connected to your girlfriend. Your comment above solidified that. If you truly cannot even begin to understand and respect an interest outside of the \u2018practical\u2019 as you call it, perhaps revisit your relationship and what you have in common. My husband shares many interests with me but also has many of his own. It is those differences that I think make him the person he is and adds value to our relationship. If that isn\u2019t how you view her artistic interests however many they are, I would suggest not dragging the relationship on any longer.", "YTA\n\nShe did her best for a gift for you, and maybe you should appreciate the effort that she put into it, as this is one of her hobbies and something she is good at.", "Wow, yes something tells me YTA in all walks of life.", "Yta\u2026.your girlfriend gave you a gift from her heart.  She even wrote you a poem..which probably took her so much time and effort.  It\u2019s the thought that counts.

Her gift was sweet and thoughtful. You're lucky she hasn't dumped you, but I guarantee you that it's coming. The one that is being selfish is Y-O-U. This was a gift from her heart, telling you how she feels about you and you obliterated her. I hope she finds someone who actually appreciates her.", "Soft Yta.  While the gift wasn't something you would pick for yourself, she likely had a lot of thought and meaning tied up in it.  Appreciate the sentiment.  You are free to discuss in a way that is not belittling how in the future the gift might be in line with your interests while still encompassing her feelings.", "Oh wow! YTA for sure! \n\nYour gf took the time, effort and put thought into your gift to make it personalised, instead of just buying an expensive item. Why can't you see the difference? Are you just about materialistic and expensive brands? \n\nYour gf sounds sweet, I hope she finds someone who really appreciates her.", "YTA.  She\u2019s sharing who she is with you.
