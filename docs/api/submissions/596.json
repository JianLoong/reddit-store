Furthermore, I didn\u2019t anticipate what would happen.\n\nIt was decided that the whole bill (accommodation and groceries) would be split over everyone even though half the group stayed one night like me and the rest were there the whole weekend.\n\nWhen I made my discomfort know about this decision know, I was told: \u201cyou chose to stay one night so you have to pay everything.\u201d And to not be \u201cdifficult because it is too hard to calculate the bill.\u201d I actually broke down crying as I have been incredibly stressed out by my financial situation. But I was I was told to just \u201csuck it up.\u201d\n\n*EDIT: I see see some responses saying I backed out at the last minute, however, before booking the house everyone including me made it known how long we were staying. Since equal amount of people either stayed Friday or Saturday night, there was no \u201cempty\u201d beds so to speak. \n\nFurthermore , the decision about how to split the costs was decided after the trip hence my surprise/distress about it. I assumed that the dinner groceries and bar drinks on the night before I arrived would be split over the people who were actually there. Just doesn\u2019t seem to be fair to pay for food & drinks that I didn\u2019t partake in.\n\nAITA for assuming the bill would be fairly split?", "created_utc": 1667136511, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yheaz8/aita_for_not_feeling_comfortable_paying_for_a/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't communicate your plan with anyone, people made their own decisions to go based upon their perception of a uniform division of costs, and you can't change the terms of your implicit agreement after the fact.

Feel free to replace the numbers with accurate ones for trip.", "NAH.\n\nThe problem here is that this isn't a hotel where they can rent the room out to someone else.  The whole property is booked and if you pay less, other people have to pay more.  I think it was a mistake to assume everyone would be fine with you paying less and staying less.  You're not the only one experiencing the cost of living crisis.\n\nYou clearly can't afford it, so you need to absolutely clearly tell your friends you cannot afford the whole bill.\n\nI would message the entire group: \"I truly cannot afford the full cost of this weekend.  I thought staying one night would be a good compromise, not realizing people would still expect me to pay the full cost.  I can either come for one night and pay the cost for that night only or I can skip the weekend entirely and not pay anything.  I am willing to do whichever the group prefers and I am sorry for any hassle this confusion has caused.\"", "NTA.  Agreements like this need to be worked out in advance.

If you and others hadn't come for just 1 night they could have rented a smaller place.", "YTA for not letting them know ahead of time - had you done so, it's very likely things would've gone differently, or you would've known that you'd still be on the hook for the entire weekend and could have declined. \n\nInstead, by not using your words in advance like an adult should, you look like the one who is trying to pull a fast one and get out of paying after you'd (as far as the rest of the attendees knew up to this point) agreed to stay and pay for the entire weekend. \n\nNot cool, and yes - you do need to suck it up. Sometimes the most valuable lessons to learn are also the most expensive ones.", "YTA\n\nThey're paying for the space you used (an extra room, bed, etc.) whether you are there or not.   If you didn't go at all, they might have found a slightly smaller, cheaper place.\n\nIf you only wanted to pay for one day, you should have said so explicitly, and been prepared for the answer to be \"no, we're still paying for your room/bed whether you are staying or not.\"\n\nEither go, or don't go. Don't expect others to pay for your space on  days you aren't there.\n\nETA - At best, you might expect to pay for the whole rental time, but only groceries on the day you were there.  But that gets complicated.", "side note: How did you all get into university if this calculation is too difficult? Its super easy to calculate cost per night stayed and split the bill that way.\n\nNonetheless, you were part of the group and the group decision was to split by person rather than by per night. (I do find it odd that if half the group stayed only one night, then the group decision was for them to pay equal to the multi-night people)\n\nPay your portion and next time get the financials decided before spending the money.\n\nYTA", "ESH. In the future, don't assume, communicate in writing with the group and in particular with whoever is booking the trip.

As others have pointed out, you took up space that had to be paid for the whole weekend, not just the one night you were there. However, you certainly didn't avail yourself of the whole weekend's worth of groceries, which you say were also factored into the total. All in all, you probably should have seen this coming, so just take it as a learning opportunity. I know it can be stressful, but whenever you're going out with a group, it's incumbent on you to make sure you know going in how much money you'll be on the hook for. If you have financial concerns, or want to make sure you're paying for only what you use or eat and not do an even split, you definitely have to make that clear to everyone up front. I know it's awkward, but I'm afraid that's life. The alternative is not going. \n\nIn any case, I'm sorry this was a stressful experience for you. Just try to learn from it and it's all good.", "ESH. I don\u2019t agree with people paying for the whole weekend if they weren\u2019t there, but they may have gotten a bigger cottage because there were more people which is why everyone had to chip in.

You shouldn't have gone at all if you couldn't afford it. \n\nYTA for expecting other people to cover your portion.  Especially since it was a weekend trip so it's not like it was a week long event you took part in.  You were probably there most of the weekend but just didn't sleep there one night. \n\nAgain,  if you can't afford the whole trip,  you shouldn't have gone.", "YTA. You needed to let them know ahead of time. Everyone, especially whoever fronted cash to rent the place, had budgeted an agreed upon amount that included you staying the whole time. When you backed out you would have made everyone else pay more (and potentially hurt their budget as well). This is a tough lesson. Even if it\u2019s due to financial reasons, you still have to do a better job of communicating that as early as you possibly can.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe bill WAS fairly split.

The people who drink the most alcohol shared the room (we are too drunk to notice the noice).

But the bed for OP had to be paid for both nights, whether OP stayed or not.\n\nETA: The point is, if OP is not paying for space rented specifically for OP's use, who is responsible for paying?

They should have discussed that prior to trip. It could go either way.  I stand by my point on food and drinks.  There's no way it's reasonable to expect the 1 night people to pay equally for those.", "How is it not fair? Some people stayed only Friday, others only Saturday.  They used same bed.  Why should OP pay extra when sleeping arrangements were made prior to trip to accommodate this?", "Cant see where it says the bed was utilised the whole weekend by different people, I can see some only stayed Friday night and some the whole weekend.\n\nIf the room is (to keep it simple) $100 a night, and there are 8 rooms then people staying the whole weekend are paying the room cost for the nights the others weren\u2019t there.\n\nIn my example the cost for night one is $800, $ 100 per person.\n\nIf half the group then left, the same $800 cost per night is now $200 per person and the rooms are empty.\n\nIn what world is that fair on those who stayed both nights?", "OP literally says in the edit that there were no empty beds.  Keeping numbers simpler since my point may not have been clear; lets say 3 people are going away for a weekend.  There's 1 hotel room with 2 beds.  Person A stays 2 nights.  Person B stays only night 1.  Person C stays only night 2.  Everyone knew this before the hotel was booked.  It is unfair to expect to split the bill evenly 3 ways.  Person A is clearly trying to pay less and take advantage of the other 2.  \n\nIn OPs case, 20ish people were involved.  Half agreed to stay 1 night and they split the nights so there were no unused rooms, BEFORE anything was booked.  The other half agreed to stay 2 nights.  Now the 2 night people want everyone to pitch in equally, not just for the rooms but for the food/drinks as well.  I would never pay for an extra day of food/alcohol that I never had any part of.   I would never pay fees for a bed someone else was sleeping in.  If it was a last minute decision to not stay, that would be different.   \n OP was clear prior to anything being reserved that they were only staying 1 night and someone else would be there the other night.  Hope that makes more sense.", "I didn\u2019t get the edit in time so going on what has been added you\u2019re right.\n\nBut sorry OP I call BS on that edit or there wouldn\u2019t be ANY animosity about splitting, in fact nobody would call you out on splitting it down.\n\nEdit seems too convenient for me sorry"]}
