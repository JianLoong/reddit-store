I replied, well, I am. Gavin said \u201coh cool!\u201d and walked away.\n\n\nAfter the party, we receive a text from Jill who was pissed that we told Gavin about our engagement. Gavin was asking all sorts of questions and it was frustrating to Jill. I asked Jill if she was cool with us being gay.

Whatever reasons she had made up in her mind to not talk to her kids about \"gay things\" would eventually blow up in her face, her kids would learn at school or somewhere else about gay couples, just like they will find out that Santa does not exist. \n\nHaving said that, you did cross a boundary they had, and that you had agreed to not cross before? so I'm a little torn here, mostly see your point but I think ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
