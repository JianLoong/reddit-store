The ONLY thing complicating OP's situation is that she feels like she has to go to bat for HER son for something that would be solved very easily in a non-blended family. To wit: if these 3 children were all OPs biological children with dad then it'd be a simple case of dad saying, \"tough shit son, dad wants to watch TV and i'm letting your sister sleep on the top bunk. I don't care what I said earlier about it being unsafe, it was designed that way and people slept in it countless times as-is so just shut up about it...\" Case closed.\n\nBut in a blended family where people are drawing untenable fairness lines it can't be that easy.

But that is beside the point. Your husband wanted to do lazy parenting (MY need to watch TV results in no bed for a kid, so the kid can just go sleep in the empty bunk regardless of safety concerns or pre established conversations) and as a result created conflict. I'm glad you stepped up in the moment with the hard and fair parenting showing your kids that promises are kept and also showing the husband the type of parent you are. After the trip, you need to have a conversation with him about stepping up himself and not trying to put his wants over your blended family's needs. Also, not putting you in the position of bad cop in front of his daughter. He should never have done that to you but you responded in the most appropriate way possible.", "Okay I think your husband is ultimately in the wrong here. When staying in close quarters, you don\u2019t get to dominate a shared space while others are trying to sleep there. And as an adult and parent, he should know that by now. When his desires and a kid\u2019s needs are at odds, the kid\u2019s needs always need to come first. \n\nWhen I was a kid and we slept on the floor at the lake house, the parents and older kids respected that the living room was out sleep-space and vacated at an appropriate time for us to go to bed. And arrangements were fluid, so they always fit the situation. If there were more little kids than big kids we switched and they took the bigger living room. \n\nBUT once kids started hitting teenage years, the groups instead became divided along genders instead of age. You kids are getting to an age where is may be inappropriate for your daughter to be sharing a bed with your sons. Especially because you haven\u2019t indicated how long you\u2019ve been married, so it\u2019s possible their relationship is still fairly new. I know you think your kids are good kids and would never do anything inappropriate but you should simply never give them the chance.  It\u2019s better to be preventative than to deal with the consequences of something inappropriate (even minority inappropriate) happening at all. \n\nNow that the top bunk has a railing and is in play, you have 2 choices: either you can stick with your promise to your oldest and put him in the top bunk above his brother below him and daughter stays on the couch. OR you sit your kids down and explain that kids that it doesn\u2019t make sense to give him the top bunk, because as much as he wants to not share with his brother, the stepsister\u2019s NEED to be in a separate bed outweighs his wants. And you both need to own that you messed up by making a promise you can\u2019t deliver on, and apologize to him. Personally I recommend option #1 bc if your sons always have to share and daughter always gets the best bed by herself, resentment will grow. You will be creating an us vs her dynamic, which can deep into other areas and situations moving forward. Also bc eventually sons might physically outgrow the ability to share a single bed, so you\u2019re just setting the precedent now instead of later. \n\nBut I also recommend you don\u2019t do thinks based on seniority. As a youngest kid that sucked, bc even as an adult my brother will always be 3 years older, so my time to get the better bed or better room or whatever just never came. Instead, rotate who gets to pick their sleeping spot first (couch, bottom bunk, top bunk). \n\nAnd talk to your husband about not being a jerk and hanging out in one of the kid\u2019s sleeping spaces while they should be getting to bed. He can go without or watch something on his phone instead.", "NTA\nHe is the one who decided no one should sleep up there so he doesn't get to change his mind again because it suits him", "Yeah there's no railing - but there wasn't one originally either and people coped just fine.", "Since your daughter is the one who didn't have a bed in the first place it makes sense she gets it.", "Even if you skipped the safety part, husband is okay with 'taking over' daughter's sleeping area for his own needs. Sorry, but if you are in cramped quarters then you don't get to push someone out of their bed. This is no different than if daughter was sleeping in a pullout couch in hotel room and husband wanted to stay up late to watch TV in that same room.", "Nta hubby sounds like he doesn\u2019t actually care about kids safety, keep a close eye on that.", "[removed]", "Nightly Rochambeau to see who wins top bunk privileges.", "this was my thinking. a teenager probably wont fall off the top bunk. they aren't babies. \n\nBut then, if the older son gets the top bunk, and the husband is watching TV, I don't think its appropriate for a step brother and sister to share a bed IN MY OPINION.", "I took it to mean once the top bunk was available, each kid would have their own sleeping spot. Daughter on pull-out couch, sons in their separate bunks.", "yeah I was thinking this too. I think it would be inappropriate for the daughter to share a bed with either son. they are not bio siblings. its just weird.", "Okay wait I took this to mean once the railing was installed, each kid would have their own bed, as daughter would stay on the pull out couch", "this was my thinking. a teenager probably wont fall off the top bunk.", "He can even look at his phone if he needs screen time.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but the husband also deemed the bunk \u201cunsafe\u201d for children. OP stated that the pull-out bed and the normal beds have the same cushion, so there isn\u2019t much difference there. I always have to sleep on a pull-out while traveling, no big deal to me. The dad could also just\u2026 wait to watch TV, or use his phone. Making your daughter get out of bed so you can binge sports isn\u2019t the greatest thing to do.", "Yeah. Sounds like the only other place to sleep was the spot he already said no one could sleep in until a railing was installed. Only reason he was making her move was because he wanted to watch tv. Meaning the only reason he told her to sleep in the spot he said was forbidden was so he could do something he WANTED to do, meaning it\u2019s for a selfish reason. So I can understand why OP and her biological kids would be upset since they were told that spot was forbidden. Also kind of makes it sound like OP\u2019s husband cares less about his daughters safety than his step sons.", ">UNTIL it benefits him\n\nI'm wondering if that's a real pattern in his behavior.  Might be worth an honest assessment on your part.", "If the pullout is a double bed, you could send stepdaughter to your bed. When you and husband are done watching tv, you can sleep on the pullout.", "cool story", "AGREE WITH YOU", "Not to mention how are the kids supposed to sleep with the TV on anyway?", ">My husband decided that one point or another that he didn't want my son to sleep on the top bunk because it's narrow and he was afraid of my son falling off (it doesn't have railings). We made the decision that no kid would sleep on the top bunk without putting in a railing\n\nActually it's even worse than that. The husband decided it wasn't safe \\*after\\* they'd promised it to OP's son. Then, after discussion, the parents jointly decided on a plan of action (nobody sleeps there until there's a railing). He's the one who raised concern in the first place (even though OP presumably has more experience with the camper considering it was hers before marriage) then unilaterally decided that his relaxation time was more important than the children's safety and offered the bed to his daughter (knowing full well that OP's son was excited about it and denied access to it)."]}
