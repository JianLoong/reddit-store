And where is the girl supposed to sleep? Tell your boy the situation and he gets it when the railing is on. It really is not a big deal. Settle down and enjoy yourselves. This won't matter in a week.

He's the A in this situation.", "ESH\n\nYour husband should have honored the agreement, b/c it was reasonable. He can go take his phone outside and watch TV (or put in headphones & sit in the driver's seat), if he's that desperate to watch TV.\n\nBut y'all let the kids overhear any of this, and your stepdaughter did NOTHING to deserve \"but my son gets it.. it's my RV, he's the oldest\" etc etc.  Ok, wicked stepmommy.\n\n(Honestly, your oldest son is an AH, too. He is not deprived b/c he is sharing a bed with his brother, and objectively it makes the most sense for your stepdaughter - the only girl/non-bio sibling and SMALLER person, presumably - to sleep in the narrow bunk anyways).  Your 12 yo who is too big for it doesn't make a lot of sense.", "NTA\n\nYou are maintaining the agreement that was made with all the children, so that everyone feels treated fairly. That\u2019s incredibly important in blended families. Your partner is being a bit of an asshole for expecting it to be OK to watch TV in a way that would disturb the existing sleeping arrangements TV is not that important", "If the rail is there now obviously someone sleeps there. Since your daughter is the one who didn't have a bed in the first place it makes sense she gets it. As well as that, I don't think you should force a girl of any age to sleep next to a man/boy if she doesn't want to. Even if it's her brother. Leaving the only single available the top bunk. It's makes sense to me that she would get it.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband was only willing to bend the rules he set in place out of his own selfishness.", "NTA\n\nYou should stick to the promise you made to you son. \n\nYour husband is being an asshole. He thought the top bunk was too narrow but if it is convenient to him, his daughter should nevertheless stay there? That is not consequent behavior.\n\nYou can also watch a lot of TV on your phone, why couldn't he do that? Did good daughter but deserve a space to sleep?", "nta. Also no, the top bunk doesn't need railings, the odds of a teenager actually falling off during their sleep is slim to none. My family has spent decades of camping and no one has ever come close to falling off.", "YTA. And here's why: MY sons, HIS daughter. You know... you got married, and that means my/mine becomes we/ours. Sharing everything, also kids.\n\nWhat does it matter, if it's HIS daughter? Image it was your daughter, what would've your reaction be? And it's YOUR camper. Why is that so important to you? I feel that you're looking for reasons \u2026 to let him look bad? You wanna be the better person but all this \"my sons\" give me bad vibes. Maybe I misinterpreted.\n\nHE DECIDED... what does that mean? Don't you have a say? Aren't you partners? Is he the man and you have to follow HIS rules? And just because HIS daughter is a girl you have a say? Your post doesn't feel right, there are some unresolved issues here. But I would suggest, treat her as your daughter. Or if you were her friend at least.\n\nDrop your mine/his attitude and I would suggest more communicating, openly. And if he is an AH for preferring his daughter to your sons, then you have a deeper problem and I hope you find a solution.", "The girl is supposed to sleep in he originally designated bed. He can't relax because the sofa is occupied. If he didn't want the sofa occupied he should have thought about that. It is no one else's fault that he is a whiny asshole.

Seems OP would have rather left stepdaughter sleep with a boy in order to accomodate her bigger son. YTA", "All of the bed cushions are the same as the pull out couch, which is a double bed. She does have somewhere to sleep. Not to mention my husband has always been against girls/boys sleeping in the same room UNTIL it benefits him.

You know... you got married, and that means my/mine becomes we/ours.\n\nYeah, no it doesn't. If my husband were to marry another woman, our kids would still be mine and his. Not his new wife's, no matter how great she'd be. I have a stepdad, and under no circumstances would i be okay with him saying i'm his daughter.", "Not to mention the kid below that she would land on.", "This is not how I took it. She never offered that solution. She was basically telling her husband to get his ass off the couch so his daughter can go to bed because they decided (1) no kids on the top bunk until a rail is in and (2) the top bunk was already promised to the son.", "I think a lot of this depends on each blended family rather than there being any hard and fast rule.", "So...no one could sleep on the top bunk because it wasn't safe...until it was inconvenient for hubby, and now it's suddenly ok. \n\nYeah, NTA.", "NTA, can't your husband read a book or watch tv on a tablet?

The only way to really be a family all of you together.\n\nYour husband is also kinda TA for suggesting it in the first place (and in front of the kids) and for seemingly not caring about his daughter's safety as much as your son's.", "Why didn't he install the rail before ya'll left on the trip? He should have anticipated not feeling like it once ya'll were on the road.", "Nta", "NTA but it's getting a little close based on the apparent point-scoring you're using your children for.  \n\nIf and when you get a rail put on the dang bunk, consider having the kids rotate who gets to sleep in it, if they all want to, rather than only allowing your oldest to use it.  \"This is mine so my child gets preference\" is not a good approach to a blended family situation.", "**10/10**", "[removed]", "But TV! TV is worth risking a child's safety for /s \n\nSeriously, you're camping, and it's only a week. What on earth does he need TV for? Go stargaze or read a book by the campfire.", "Yep ESH, she's right about the details of this case but the vibe that the parents are giving to this family is horrid", "I mean yeah, biologically speaking it\u2019s his kid.", "How, no kid should be sleeping on the top bunk until railings are placed?", "tell me you don\u2019t have step siblings or are a step parent without telling me you don\u2019t have either.", " My family has spent decades of camping and no one has ever come close to falling off.", "They inspected it and jointly decided it was unsafe until a rail was added. Husband then decided mid trip nah, tv is more important.", "I may be jumping the gun here\u2026 but, what if he was trying to establish the boys sharing the bed while this \u201cproblem\u201d was fixed, and then say, \u201cwell, they already can sleep together, so daughter can take the top bunk and now we have living space.\u201d That\u2019s just where my mind went. Especially since he suddenly deemed it safe enough without the bar, as it suited his needs.", "If her father won\u2019t let her use it, then she would need another place to sleep. Although the main take away is that her father just needs to leave, so she can sleep.", "The decision it wasn\u2019t safe was made jointly by both parents. Now the dad wants to change both the safety analysis and the sleeping arrangement for the sake of watching tv.", "Unless you have the exact same camper/bed, that\u2019s irrelevant. And it not happening to you doesn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t happen to someone else in a completely different situation.", "Correct, that attitude can creep into the kids and lead to issues. Even in this situation it is evident.\n\nFamilies, just like anything else in life, are not always going to be fair. The ONLY thing complicating OP's situation is that she feels like she has to go to bat for HER son for something that would be solved very easily in a non-blended family. To wit: if these 3 children were all OPs biological children with dad then it'd be a simple case of dad saying, \"tough shit son, dad wants to watch TV and i'm letting your sister sleep on the top bunk. I don't care what I said earlier about it being unsafe, it was designed that way and people slept in it countless times as-is so just shut up about it...\" Case closed.\n\nBut in a blended family where people are drawing untenable fairness lines it can't be that easy. Mom is acting as if Dad wanting to watch TV is part of an elaborate plot to get HIS daughter the top bunk and poke HER son in the eye. That's insane. Dad just wanted to watch TV and had a very simple solution.", "LOL this comment just shows how much you have stayed in a camper. or should i say, how you obviously have never stayed in a camper, even one that was built in the 70's (I have) and one built even today (once again, I have). Here is a little news flash for you. The ones built today don't have railings built into them, so your argument is invalid.", "Lol what are you on about? Your comment does not make sense in the context of the one you replied to. Did you mean to reply to a different comment?", "Except it does but you do you genius."]}
