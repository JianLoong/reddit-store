Your husband was being selfish", "Yeah kind of. I mean, now everyone has to go to bed annoyed or angry over something so small. Vacation is about relaxing. Why can't he relax? And where is the girl supposed to sleep? Tell your boy the situation and he gets it when the railing is on. It really is not a big deal. Settle down and enjoy yourselves. This won't matter in a week. Enjoy life and your time together.", "ESH - man, you\u2019re throwing a fit because *your* son wanted a bunk and *his* daughter needed it. There\u2019s a clear divide on how you view the children.\n\nWhy wasn\u2019t it inspected before the trip? Why was it now safe now that your child wanted to use it?\n\nHe wants to relax and decides to just kick his daughter out and tells her that it\u2019s fine for her to sleep on the (unsafe according to him) bunk.", "NTA.\n\nIt speaks volumes that he\u2019s willing to risk his daughter\u2019s safety, but not that of your son.

He's the A in this situation.", "ESH\n\nYour husband should have honored the agreement, b/c it was reasonable. He can go take his phone outside and watch TV (or put in headphones & sit in the driver's seat), if he's that desperate to watch TV.\n\nBut y'all let the kids overhear any of this, and your stepdaughter did NOTHING to deserve \"but my son gets it.. it's my RV, he's the oldest\" etc etc.  Ok, wicked stepmommy.\n\n(Honestly, your oldest son is an AH, too. He is not deprived b/c he is sharing a bed with his brother, and objectively it makes the most sense for your stepdaughter - the only girl/non-bio sibling and SMALLER person, presumably - to sleep in the narrow bunk anyways).  Your 12 yo who is too big for it doesn't make a lot of sense.", "NTA\n\nYou are maintaining the agreement that was made with all the children, so that everyone feels treated fairly. That\u2019s incredibly important in blended families. Your partner is being a bit of an asshole for expecting it to be OK to watch TV in a way that would disturb the existing sleeping arrangements TV is not that important", "If the rail is there now obviously someone sleeps there. Since your daughter is the one who didn't have a bed in the first place it makes sense she gets it. As well as that, I don't think you should force a girl of any age to sleep next to a man/boy if she doesn't want to. Even if it's her brother. Leaving the only single available the top bunk. It's makes sense to me that she would get it.", "NTA. Sounds like your husband was only willing to bend the rules he set in place out of his own selfishness.", "NTA\n\nYou should stick to the promise you made to you son. \n\nYour husband is being an asshole. He thought the top bunk was too narrow but if it is convenient to him, his daughter should nevertheless stay there? That is not consequent behavior.\n\nYou can also watch a lot of TV on your phone, why couldn't he do that? Did good daughter but deserve a space to sleep?", "nta. Also no, the top bunk doesn't need railings, the odds of a teenager actually falling off during their sleep is slim to none. My family has spent decades of camping and no one has ever come close to falling off.", "YTA. And here's why: MY sons, HIS daughter. You know... you got married, and that means my/mine becomes we/ours. Sharing everything, also kids.\n\nWhat does it matter, if it's HIS daughter? Image it was your daughter, what would've your reaction be? And it's YOUR camper. Why is that so important to you? I feel that you're looking for reasons \u2026 to let him look bad? You wanna be the better person but all this \"my sons\" give me bad vibes. Maybe I misinterpreted.\n\nHE DECIDED... what does that mean? Don't you have a say? Aren't you partners? Is he the man and you have to follow HIS rules? And just because HIS daughter is a girl you have a say? Your post doesn't feel right, there are some unresolved issues here. But I would suggest, treat her as your daughter. Or if you were her friend at least.\n\nDrop your mine/his attitude and I would suggest more communicating, openly. And if he is an AH for preferring his daughter to your sons, then you have a deeper problem and I hope you find a solution.", "The girl is supposed to sleep in he originally designated bed. He can't relax because the sofa is occupied. If he didn't want the sofa occupied he should have thought about that. It is no one else's fault that he is a whiny asshole.

She has a bed that her father wants to take away.", "NTA this 100 percent", "Honestly, more accurate your post should\u2019ve been\u2026 Am I the asshole for not agreeing for my step daughter to be endangered in order for my husband to watch TV?", "THIS. Seems OP would have rather left stepdaughter sleep with a boy in order to accomodate her bigger son. YTA", "All of the bed cushions are the same as the pull out couch, which is a double bed. She does have somewhere to sleep. Not to mention my husband has always been against girls/boys sleeping in the same room UNTIL it benefits him. This arrangement was all established prior to going on this trip and I stated it in the post.", "No. OP marrying doesn\u2019t change which kids are who\u2019s.", ">MY sons, HIS daughter. You know... you got married, and that means my/mine becomes we/ours.\n\nYeah, no it doesn't. If my husband were to marry another woman, our kids would still be mine and his. Not his new wife's, no matter how great she'd be. I have a stepdad, and under no circumstances would i be okay with him saying i'm his daughter.", "Not to mention the kid below that she would land on.", "This is not how I took it. She never offered that solution. She was basically telling her husband to get his ass off the couch so his daughter can go to bed because they decided (1) no kids on the top bunk until a rail is in and (2) the top bunk was already promised to the son.", "I think a lot of this depends on each blended family rather than there being any hard and fast rule."]}
