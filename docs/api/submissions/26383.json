She got herself some running shoes and some other basic gear from Decathlon, all pretty cheap as she wanted to test the waters and didn't know if she'd stick with it on the long-term. But she did end up sticking with it, and since her birthday was coming up I thought I'd get her a pair of higher quality running shoes.\r\n\nNow, my daughter is generally more masculine than she is feminine. I'm not sure why - as a child she wasn't particularly tomboyish, but not overly girly either. She loved pretty dresses just as much as she loved soccer practice and never seemed to care whether something was for boys or for girls. At around age 12 though, she started avoiding everything deemed feminine like the plague, and suddenly only wanted boys' everything: boys' clothes, boys' haircuts, boys' games and toys etc. And neither me nor my husband ever had a problem with it. We've always let her express herself however she wanted, though I do admit we didn't really understand this unexplained aversion to all things feminine and kind of hoped she'd grow out of it over the years.\r\n\nBack to the shoes, I asked her if she preferred any particular brands and she said something about Asics Gel. I looked them up online and they were quite pricey for my budget, but I did some searching around the outlets in our city and ended up finding a pair in her size. The only catch was that it was from the women's section, though you really couldn't tell by just looking at the design (it was plain black & white).\r\n\nWhen my daughter saw them on her birthday, she was absolutely thrilled. That is, until her father made a joke that went something like \"Hey, you finally own one clothing item from the women's section now!\". She was visibly upset by that comment and immediately asked me if the shoes really were from the women's section. And when I confirmed it, her face fell and just like that, all the excitement was gone.\r\n\nI feel horrible because she did try to act grateful, but you could still tell she was disappointed by the gift. At the same time though, I cannot for the life of me understand why a pair of shoes she was initially all over the moon about immediately became a disappointment after it was revealed they were from the women's. My husband owns a few pairs of women's shoes himself because he says the colors are just more cheerful, I honestly can't see what the big deal is here.\r\n\nMy daughter hasn't worn her new shoes even once since and I'm starting to wonder if I made an asshole move here.

If we base everything off a 1500 calorie diet, they can just do half minus a little bit and still be accurate. There is serious psychological implications of a higher-calorie default on packaging: the higher-calorie line becomes an 'anchor point' and everything below it now feels like a deficit, which can lead to overeating. \n\nI also think it is problematic that we pin to a higher-calorie diet in a general health sense- we don't have a malnutrition issue in the US in even close to same numbers as we have an obesity epidemic, and so much has to change institutionally, and this is one of those things.\n\nI also really have an issue with you expecting that the women will be educated enough to know that they constantly need to do math in order to understand the calories, fat, carbs, and proteins that go into their bodies. Fixation on food is a much bigger issue amongst women than it is men at the moment - forcing women to constantly spend even more time fixating and making sure their math is correct is an unacceptable consequence of male convenience. \n\nAs for medications, my point was that women are excluded from the majority of drug trials until the last phase because our 'hormones can throw off measurements'.

Women died from exposure to Covid-19 that men did not have because of misfitting PPE. The male-default had a death count here too. If in your mind, the higher risk group is men, think again.

That's why it's important to check in with her and see what she's most comfortable with!\n\nThere's a distinct possibility she would prefer a different pronoun or for them to refer to her a different way. Not for sure. So you ask, and you let her know you're okay no matter what the answer is.", "asking someone what pronouns they prefer isn't a diagnosis????", "Yup. A whole new generation of gender role enforcers, happily pissing away all the progress we\u2019ve made in accepting gender nonconformity.", "How much of it was that and how much of it was Dad's \"joke\"?\n\nEither way, I agree OP should definitely offer to take her child to return the shoes or give child the receipt so they can return the shoes and put the refund towards whatever shoes they want.\n\nThough if OP went with them for the return, it would be an opportunity to make it clear that whoever their child is- OP doesn't care.", "I'd bet all the money in my bank account that the actual issue is a lack of respect for the daughters choices. Especially with the way the father phrased it, \"you finally have a piece of clothes from the women's section\". It's the same as those people who insist on sneaking ingredients you don't like into your food, and then going \"Aha! Got you, you *do* like mushrooms\" when you eat it. It's sounds like the latest instance in a long line of her parents trying to undermine her style and force her into femininity. She is upset at her father acting like they 'got one over on her' and 'tricking' her into wearing something feminine.", "Sorry, are you arguing with the source of someone\u2019s feelings? What? Bonkers.", "I think the problem here is that the father\u2019s comment may have made her think she was being \u201ctricked\u201d into wearing women\u2019s clothing. Regardless of aesthetics, I think she could have been mostly upset at what she perceived as a gotcha moment set up by her parents. As if they were saying \u201cSEE! There *are* feminine things you want to wear\u201d. Regardless of whether I liked the style or not, I would not be thrilled with a gift given under those conditions.", "I\u2019ve explained in other comments, but I think it\u2019s very possible her father\u2019s comment made her feel tricked by her parents into wearing something feminine, regardless of how feminine it actually appeared. The negative response may be more in relation to this feeling of being deceived rather than the shoe\u2019s origin.", "I mean, OP didn't say her kid really addressed the joke at all, other than asking the question. \n\nOP's kid probably did feel hurt and chose to say nothing, telling themselves they should just get over it and that dad didn't mean anything mean by it... a stranger probably wouldn't have mattered, but it hurts more when it's a person close to you. I'm gonna guess it's probably not the first \"joke\" dad's made on this issue (which likely reaches a little further than just clothing). If OP's kid really has been embraced and accepted for what they prefer from a young age I wouldn't have expected the joke to hit a nerve- so I'm (yes, totally an assumption) gonna guess OP's kid is just a little tired of these small \"harmless\" jabs.", "All we really know is after the joke their attitude changed, and yes, they asked about the store. Seems like she didn't really say anything else after asking and tried to appreciate the gift. The joke may have made them feel like the shoes being from the women's section was meant to \"trick\" them into having a piece of women's clothing. We just don't know. OP doesn't seem like a bad mom nor does the family sound like they have a bad dynamic from this post alone, so best thing OP can do is talk to their kid about it.", "It wasn't a trick but dad's comment comes across that way. He may have given it zero thought at all, but it obviously didn't feel that way to her.", "Exactly.  Your family is loving and trustworthy. Not everyone feels that way about the folks who share their genes.  For example, my dad is a horrible misogynist, so when he jokes that way it's him being an asshole, not a loving, fun person.", "The sentence, \"This has a particular vibe,\" is deeply distinct from, \"I have discerned the underlying reality of the situation and there can be no other read on it.\"", "In the universe we both inhabit, where anything can be made \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d based off of arbitrary cultural understanding. Maybe the shoe was noticeably suited to women, maybe it wasn\u2019t. But there are many women who intentionally avoid *anything* that could be construed as feminine not because they are trans but because they\u2019ve decided they don\u2019t want to fit into that box that\u2019s been imposed on them.", "Even if she transitioned she'd still be a woman. Trans men are females or did we forget that ever since Obama became president?", "She rejects the shoe because she doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as feminine, regardless of how the shoe looks. It\u2019s not a completely reasonable choice but I understand it. Not wanting to be perceived as feminine is completely different from having gender dysphoria. Gender nonconforming people exist. They aren\u2019t trans, they don\u2019t need therapy, they don\u2019t need hormones. What they need is to be accepted as they are and left alone.", "Learning the shoe is a women\u2019s shoe changed her perception and lead her to believe it was feminine. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s reasonable but I understand it. Rejecting femininity is not rejecting womanhood. To believe otherwise is sexist.", "ah yes because asking a grown ass adult if they would prefer a different pronoun (and accepting whatever answer) is the same as forcibly medically transitioning a child?", "Exactly", "Yeah, there\u2019s a lot going on here but I think her father\u2019s comment and her reaction are VERY telling. If OP\u2019s daughter does have gender dysphoric tendencies, it makes sense. If she just doesn\u2019t like femme clothing, it makes sense. I wager that when she started eschewing a feminine style, it was a big deal in their home.", "This is the only explanation for the daughter's reaction I've read that seems plausible with the amount of info presented.", "This makes sense. I hadn't considered this perspective.", ">OP's kid probably did feel hurt and chose to say nothing, telling themselves they should just get over it and that dad didn't mean anything mean by it... a stranger probably wouldn't have mattered, but it hurts more when it's a person close to you. I'm gonna guess it's probably not the first \"joke\" dad's made on this issue\n\nAll of this is what I'd refer to as an assumption.", "And yet, they are both leading into assumptions.", "Now we're drawing the transphobes in over information that shouldn't be assumed anyway.", "No one has said that she needs these things or that she's trans though. The OP asked AITA, commenters are using context to determine that. This is part of the context, whether that's alright or not, they (in this thread you commented on), are NOT assuming her gender nor saying she needs any of the things you listed. Simply giving OP an open means of talking to them about this if that IS the case. But again, no one is assuming it is. OP wants a judgement about it and people are giving them one.", "If OP's daughter were only rejecting femininity and not womanhood in general, what's the issue with shoes that look gender neutral but come from the women's section?", "Since we're talking about OP's kid and not to OP's kid, that's all we can do. We don't know what went through her mind in that moment or afterwards, other than she didn't make a fuss and \"tried to be grateful\".", "Not really, no. Saying that something is a possibility, or that it makes sense in keeping with the available information, is not an assumption. You really need to draw an actual conclusion for an assumption to be present.", "She could have very easily been upset by how she received the gift. Her father\u2019s comment may have caused her to feel like the gift was a trick to get her to unknowingly wear feminine clothing, regardless of how the shoe looked. As if they were saying \u201cSEE! You DO like feminine clothing\u201d by getting her to express excitement for them. I would not be happy to receive a gift, even one I liked, under such conditions.", "That's still an assumption lmao. You really should look up the definition of the word if you're gonna die on this hill."]}
