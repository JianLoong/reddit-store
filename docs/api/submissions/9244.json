We have started to get stationary orders together and we\u2019ve run into an issue that has our families split. My fianc\u00e9 (34M) and I are not very traditional, and our wedding is going to have some unorthodox aspects. In addition to an open bar we\u2019re also doing a cannabis bar, and the desserts are coming from a vegan bakery (we\u2019re not vegan, we just like this bakery). My parents are quite conservative and his are less so but still lean towards that end.\n\nThe issue is that I want to include a note with the invitations asking people not to wear pastel colors to the wedding. My bridal party is wearing pastels (they were able to choose their own dresses/outfits) and my wedding dress is blush pink. The tradition is that you don\u2019t wear white to a wedding, but I don\u2019t really want someone to show up and accidentally match my or my attendants\u2019 clothes because they were avoiding white. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t know that my dress is pink but he was fine when I explained about the bridal party. Both of our sibling groups also thought it was a good idea.\n\nHis parents were not enthusiastic about it and my parents were downright offended. His mom basically told us we can do whatever we want but we\u2019re going to look incredibly rude for dictation what people wear to our wedding as guests. My mother screamed at me and called me an entitled brat. She said with the type of wedding we\u2019re having we have no right to ask anything of our guests, and we \u201cshould just be thankful people are coming because no one wants to smell dope at a wedding reception.\u201d When I told her my dress wasn\u2019t white she yelled at me about that too and then kicked me out of her house.\n\nI\u2019ve been rethinking the entire wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I are cannabis enthusiasts and he runs a dispensary, but I can see how maybe some people won\u2019t enjoy that aspect so maybe my mom is right and we shouldn\u2019t have it. It would make me sad but I think I understand. I also am second guessing my choice of dress. My mom wasn\u2019t there when I chose it and she would have had a problem with it (kind of why I didn\u2019t invite her to come in the first place) but maybe she\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a black tie affair so maybe I shouldn\u2019t ask people to wear specific things.\n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: For those asking, yes the wedding is explicitly child free. No one under the age of 21 will be allowed into the event and we have already contracted a security guard to enforce this. Also, we are well aware that many people will not want to attend and we are fine with that. Most of my family lives on the other side of the country and we are planning a bbq next summer to celebrate with them. We expect about 40 people (our friends and some of his family) to attend and they are all cannabis-friendly.\n\nThe wedding is being held on our property and all of the cannabis will be kept and consumed outside. There will not be edibles available, and all of this will be be explained on the invitations.\n\nAlso this is the text that we wanted to put on the invitations about the dress code:\n\n\u201cAs you know, we have always enjoyed things that are outside of tradition. As such, you may see the bridal party incorporate some non-traditional colors for the ceremony, and we\u2019re asking guests to please avoid wearing light pastel colors.\u201d", "created_utc": 1675641972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10urxf5/wibta_for_including_a_note_about_dress_code_with/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People can choose alcohol but second hand smoke harder to avoid. Think the edibles sounds a great alternative as puts choice in hands of people to consume or not.\n\nIt's not really a AH question.

And, ignore your family\u2019s opinions.", "I\u2019m also a very much pro canna\u2026.but I can 100% see why having that open at the reception would make people uncomfortable. \nIf the it\u2019s set up outside?

I'd suggest that being something that goes on the wedding site or word of mouth.  I'll also encourage you to make it known you are having the cannabis bar since that's not a typical thing to encounter at a wedding.  Yes, your mom said it in a judgemental way, but anyone with addiction issues or allergies should be aware so they can plan ahead and still celebrate you", "INFO: Are you expressly telling people in the invitation that you are having a cannabis bar so that they can choose not to attend? The smell gives a lot of people a headache or they just do not enjoy the smell. Also, as someone else asked is this a child-friendly wedding?\n\nIn terms of the dress code, it is generally unacceptable to tell people what colors not to wear other than white and in some cases, black for women. You can say \"casual\" or \"Black tie\" but given that your wedding is at the end of summer, pastels and brights are likely what people would wear.", "ESH. Your mom overreacted big time.\n\nBut. \n\nYou might want to ask yourself why it's so important that only you and the bridal party wear pastels. Are you worried a guest might be mistaken for a bridesmaid? Would you feel your wedding is ruined if that happens? Do you have a particular group photo in mind that will only look good if nobody is in pastels but the bridal party? What will you do if someone misunderstands or disregards your requested dress code? Confront them? Turn them away at the door? Give them a jacket to cover the pastel? What if someone wears a color you think is a pastel but they insist isn't pastel? Are you going to be so upset that you can't enjoy your day? How will you feel if someone tells you they can't come because the only suitable outfits they have to wear include pastels and they can't afford to buy something new? \n\nMy experience was this: I had a fall wedding. The bridesmaids wore brown. The groomsmen wore kilts. A couple female wedding guests also wore brown. A couple men wore their own kilts. And none of this detracted from the wedding at all. The day was amazing. My pictures look beautiful. And I didn't even notice that any of my female guests wore the same color as my bridesmaids until I looked at my wedding pics just now to see if anyone had worn brown. My wedding turned out exactly as I wanted it to be - better, even. \n\nIt's true that your wedding day will go by so fast that you'll barely remember any of it and won't notice half of what's going on. You might think that a guest wearing a pastel would bother you, but I can practically guarantee you that on your wedding day, you'll be so happy that your friends and family are there to celebrate with you that you won't notice or care what they are wearing.", "NTA but seriously, get over yourself. The bride/groom & wedding party will be at the front of the church/room/whatever and all eyes will be on them. No one will care that Betsy in row 15, seat 8 is wearing a pink dress.", "I don't see what a big deal it would be if people showed up wearing pastel; not everyone will, so what does it matter? So you might be a bit of an AH for requesting this.\n\nBut I was horrified to read about your mother's reaction. She screamed at you and called you an entitled brat? She then kicked you out of her house because your dress won't be white? That's not someone I'd want at my wedding \u2014 or in my life.\n\nNot sure about cannabis at the wedding; I'm not against, but wouldn't like being around the smell. Maybe have a reception, and then a party later with your pro-cannabis friends to celebrate?", "It does leave out a lot of wedding options if you take out ALL pastels. But isn't terribly rude if you give plenty of time. The wedding as a whole sounds very uncomfortable to me. I don't think I'd be okay attending but it wouldn't be because you asked me not to wear pastels. \n\nOn that part you could just say we respectfully ask for guests to not wear pastels as the wedding party will be wearing pastels if you really have to say something. NTA I guess?", "Eek.  No pastels is really hard.  Is there a different way you can differentiate the wedding party\u2026 embroidered shawls? Flowers in their hair? Something else?  \n\nI once showed up to a wedding in a beautiful navy blue retro dress with beading.  I felt absolutely lovely going to the wedding, thinking their colors were shades of green. Shortly after arriving another guest rudely said, \u201cYour dress is just like the bridesmaids.\u201d  I felt horrible.  I sat in the back, kept my shawl on, despite it being warm.  Then, when I finally saw the bride I apologized and you know how she responded? Great big hug, told me she loved my dress, and was glad I was there.  Late in the evening the bridesmaids even all pulled me onto the dance floor with them.  I had a fun night and am forever grateful for the gracious bride and bridesmaids!", "Soft YTA. You are banning an entire spectrum of colors from your wedding. I can understand white or beige or pink if that's the wedding party, but all pastels? Over the top. You're inviting people to come in red out of spite.\n\nYou've got a bigger problem than pastels. Your mom. Screaming and insulting and kicking you out are not acceptable behaviors. You've got a bully on your hands.", "\u201cPastel colors\u201d? That covers a rather wide spectrum, literally. Does beige count?

So everyone has to put up with your quirky little dope bar, but you won\u2019t let them wear their \u201cgo to\u201d nice outfit if it\u2019s fucking PASTEL? You sound spoiled and tacky as hell.", "ESH \n\nYour mom is an AH. She's judgemental and rude. You absolutely are in your right to wear whatever color dress you want....and blush is actually super popular right now for wedding dresses (it's not like it's neon pink....which would also be absolutely fine). Don't second guess your dress. And, because blush has become popular,  it's part of the family of what guests aren't going to wear. \n\n\nI don't think you are an \"AH,\" but I usually take that judgment as \"am I in the wrong?\" I do think you are in terms of eliminating an entire color palette. You'd also have people who start spending time wondering \"is this too light, and over thinking their choices\". Are pastels actually common for people to wear to weddings where you live or would you be unlikely to see it? Where I live, 90% of guests wear black, but reading reddit, that seems uncommon. Is it an evening wedding or afternoon...I feel like pastel is even less likely in evening. But, as this is the title question, I'm ruling ESH. \n\n\n\nAs for the cannabis, it really depends in your crowd. Is it mostly your friends who partake? Is it mostly family who doesn't? Is it all edibles or is smoking allowed? How strong is the smell? I personally can't stand the smell and wouldn't enjoy being there, but i know a lot of my friends would.", "I\u2019m concerned about the aspect of DUI from being under the influence of edibles since they take such a looooong time to kick in and people being inexperienced trying them. Also I hope this is no kids allowed. Never heard of a cannabis bar at a wedding. As for no pastels, that\u2019s odd because everyone was allowed to choose their own color, it\u2019s not like their all in yellow. To each his own I guess. NTA", "You will be giving off bridezilla vibes.If it\u2019s black tie, that\u2019s different. No pastels?\nThat\u2019s a bit off.", "Are ypu having kids at this wedding?", "ESH - Your wedding and you can have whatever you want. A weed bar and some vegan stuff hardly makes it that unique and really has nothing to do with the issue. \n\nBlocking out an entire color palette, in my opinion, is tacky. You can indicate formal or semi-formal etc, but no pastels in the *off chance* a guest matches your bridesmaids dresses. No. \n\nI also dont think as adults your parents should be screaming at you.", "YTA\n\nToo much, just for the sake of it.", "YTA - do you want people to come share your day? Or do you want props to make your day perfect? Honestly I don't understand the hoops people make guests go through these days. Invite people - and be happy if they attend.", "ESH it's an obnoxious ask. Do you want your guests to have fun or be props for your \"perfect day\". Your mother made valuable points, but she was an AH in the way she communicated them.", "Soft YTA. I honestly think the wedding sounds great, but asking people not to wear pastels is a bit much. Enjoy your special day!", "YTA \n\nNo pastels. That is 90% of the colours people would wear to a wedding. \n\nMost women wear softer pastels to a wedding. \n\nNo pinks or something would be fine. \n\nA cannabis bar. Different. Whatever.

I\u2019m not a huge fan of wedding with specific dress codes but no pastels is pretty doable, so NTA, especially because there\u2019s the potential for free weed.\n\nJust one suggestion: make sure your venue is aware of the cannabis bar, as that code affect their insurance. I\u2019m sure your fianc\u00e9 is very aware of the legalities/liabilities, and it doesn\u2019t sound like they have an issue. Just two cents from a pothead insurance agent lol.", "ESH. Yes, it's rude to tell your guests what to wear to your wedding.

It's the same reason you don't serve Limburger cheese or durians at a party that is not specifically organized around Let's All Enjoy the Stanky Thing That Nevertheless Is Enjoyable.  Also, does the venue even permit smoking indoors?  (Disregard if the cannabis bar is edibles only.)", "Yeah, I\u2019d have a problem with the cannabis bar. Pot stinks. I understand why you want it, agree with the person who suggested edibles, as long as it\u2019s legal where you are. I know of a wedding where pot caused a big family rift when the people who couldn\u2019t be around it for professional reasons had to abruptly leave the reception.\n\nAs an older, more conservative person, I don\u2019t agree with the idea that brides can dictate what the guests wear. As Miss Manners says, they\u2019re guests, not props.\n\n*However* I often check with the brides mum - I\u2019m the age where it\u2019s my friend\u2019s kids getting married - just to make sure I\u2019m not wearing the wedding colours or something. I think it would be ok if you mentioned it to some people who might spread it around that pastel colours might not be the best choice if they have another choice.\n\nI think a blush pink wedding dress sounds lovely. There\u2019s no reason why every wedding has to be the same. Best wishes for a long and happy life together.", "YTA. Because it is rude to wear white to a wedding. But if you\u2019re choosing to wear a nontraditional color, you have to accept that other people might coincidentally wear the same color. It\u2019s an easy thing to accept if you remember that your dress will probably be the most elaborate and that everybody\u2019s focus will be on you. In the unlikely event that anybody is slightly confused about who the bride is (maybe a +1 you\u2019ve never met), will your day be unsalvageable? If you think so, you need to recalibrate yourself before you drift irreversibly into bridezilla territory.\n\nCredentials: I wore a peach pink tea-length dress and my fitting was ruined by my judgmental mother.

(For example, I have asthma and struggle terribly around smoke of any kind.)", "NTA about a dress code, that\u2019s pretty common. But if you don\u2019t already plan to, you absolutely must put on the invitation that there will be a cannabis bar. Smokers have a tendency to think that everybody who\u2019s not super against it is as cool with it as they are, and that\u2019s simply not the case. I don\u2019t care if people smoke but I can\u2019t be around it, it aggravates my asthma and gives me a headache. Plus honestly I hate the smell and I know I\u2019m not the only one out there. I would respectfully decline to attend your wedding and hold you no ill will for doing what you want on your special day. If I wasn\u2019t warned ahead of time and arrived to a cloud of smoke, I\u2019d be pissed. So just. Do you, have the wedding you want, make sure you give people all the information they need to make their own decisions, and also keep in mind that not everybody is going to want to come and don\u2019t hold that against them.", "NTA as far as wedding request go this is pretty tame.", "NTA just.\n\nYour wedding so you choose.\n\nGiving a dress code is not unusual, and actually helpful for guests.\n\nYou want cannabis and it's legal?

Ideally ask bridesmaids to stick with a smaller subset of colours, eg yellow and blue, and ask guests just to avoid pastel yellow, blue and pink.

I understand people may have some traditions they want to incorporate into their weddings even if they ignore a bunch of other ones, but \"cannabis bar\" is making me picture a pretty relaxed vibe that \"major color palette off limits to all guests\" does not fit into.\n\nIn case this perspective helps - I got married at a summer camp. I did wear white, though it wasn't a very \"bridal\" dress. We put a lot of thought into what to list as the \"dress code\" on our wedding website (not the invitation - this level of detail doesn't belong there IMO) because I really wanted people to be comfortable in the setting, wear shoes they could walk in, and not be worried about ruining their clothes if they sat on a bench that still pretty much looked like the tree it was made out of. I was also hoping, though, that as a group we would all look a little \"wedding-y.\" We ended up using the phrase \"summer camp semi-formal\" and most people wore the kind of thing I imagined (sun dresses, khakis with button-down shirts, etc.). One friend wore one of those t-shirts with the image of a tuxedo front on it, not what I was going for but who cares! He had a great time, we were glad he was there, and I have no idea if he felt out of place but I hope not. In retrospect I wish I had not said anything about the dress code at all - I was trying to help people know what was expected but that made-up description for it probably just confused things more.

The other was embroidered floral dress I happened to get for a steal otherwise it would have been out of my price range.

I think there comes a point where it feels like it's not enough to travel, take time off work, and show up in something that fits the dress code and celebrate -- now the guests are a prop in the event.", "God that sounds incredible and exactly like something I would do for my wedding", "A bride this picky about what guests wear is way too likely to be absurd about colors. If you have to submit a color swatch to go to a wedding, she is absolutely a bridezilla.", "Eh, agree to disagree then.

But clearly, that\u2019s just me.", "Im going to say NTA because I have a few friends getting married this year and have been urging them to insist on dress codes. \n\nI went to a wedding last year and I feel bad to say aside from the bridal party, my partner and I were the only ones who dressed up nicely. I feel so bad for that couple and their pics! \n\nJust as a little note, you kinda come across one of those \"we're weird get over it\" i dunno, in my experience, not many people enjoy those people so I can understand why there is some pushback from your future in laws", "Accidentally showing up to a wedding wearing the same colours as the bridal party is low key horrifying tbh", "Your mom sounds horrible.

Please avoid wearing green as that is the wedding party color.", "NTA - it's your wedding. BUT - people also have free will. When it comes to anything wedding related like children, OTHER specific color groups, and meal types, people say \"hey! it's your wedding.\" \n\nIf I got invited to a wedding that wanted me to not wear pastels, I would simply, wear a dark colored outfit? It's really not that crazy to ask. It's basically the same if you asked your guests not to wear jewel tones or everyone to wear black. It leaves plenty of options. \n\nOn the cannabis discussion (that's not the discussion) realize that not everyone will want to be around that, and I'm sure as you know that the smell spreads easily and quickly, even outside. You will more than likely have people leave continuously through the night instead of all at the end. \n\nBut! I think your wedding sounds lovely, your wedding is to proclaim YOUR love to YOUR husband and show everyone else in a celebration about YOU and YOUR HUSBAND. It's not about mom, or aunt margaret, or uncle rickies ex wife. So why should they get a say? Are they paying for it? Are they going to be the ones looking back at the photo album with their family on their nth anniversary?\n\nI also want a pastel not white wedding dress, and usually bridal party standing out from the crowd makes for stunning pictures. Best wedding wishes. :)", "Jfc. NTA. Have whatever type of wedding you want. Your color request is not unreasonable but as some other people suggested you could just mention the color pastel pink or print the specific colors onto the invitation so people are aware! Don't mind your mom's reaction either it was way over the top. The anti weed golks are really going hard against you but they're not invited to your wedding and you're doing it in a way that respects other people's choice to not want to smoke or have smoke on their clothes.

Telling your guests not to wear pastels isn\u2019t a thing.", "NTA, however, I do think you are being a little over the top.  If the color is a must, I suggest invitations that include little circles of the colors the bridal party is wearing to show guests exactly what colors not to wear.

We own a barn and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going the wedding, and we\u2019re blocking off the back entrance and putting the bar outside in front of it. So to get to the weed, which is all outside, you have to walk out the front and then go around to the back of the barn. We\u2019ve also already ordered signs with directions for guests who smoke, including keeping everything outside at the back of the barn, waiting 10-15 minutes after you finish to go back inside, and not pressuring others who don\u2019t want to partake.", "They\u2019re welcome to not come if cannabis gives them headaches.

The cannabis bar was fully spelled out on our save the dates and will be detailed on the invitations, so no one should be at all surprised. We don\u2019t fault anyone for not coming because of it, there will be an opportunity for those people to celebrate with us next year, but we are not willing to budge on a major part of how we want to celebrate our marriage.", "I'd just wear darker colours, deep blues, purples, brighter colours, there are a lot of options", "Admittedly I could easily avoid wearing a pastel dress. However, people wearing pastel dresses to weddings is VERY common. And it's not a single color, it's a bunch of colors. It's the equivalent of \"don't wear any bright colors\". Is it doable? Sure. But it's an unusually controlling request that is going to come off as bossy and weird to many people.\n\nIf my invitation said not to wear pastel colors I would judge the couple as annoyingly controlling and be somewhat offput. Not beacuse I love pastel colors more then bright or dark colors but beacuse I've literally never gotten a request like this from a bride in my life. My wedding the wedding party wore purple, we didn't tell guests not to wear purple. The most recent wedding I went to had like 8 bridesmaids in different jewel tones. Guests were not told not to wear jewel tones. Etc many times.\n\nI just . . . don't get the problem? What if a guest is wearing the same shade or even the same colors as the bridal party? So what? *Maybe* OP could say she is wearing pastel pink and for no one to wear that color. At least it would be one color? But that still just seems pointless. Does OP really think anyone will be confused about whether she's the bride or not?\n\nOP should wear the pink dress she wants and lets her guests wear the colors they want too. All of it is fine.
