We have started to get stationary orders together and we\u2019ve run into an issue that has our families split. My fianc\u00e9 (34M) and I are not very traditional, and our wedding is going to have some unorthodox aspects. In addition to an open bar we\u2019re also doing a cannabis bar, and the desserts are coming from a vegan bakery (we\u2019re not vegan, we just like this bakery). My parents are quite conservative and his are less so but still lean towards that end.\n\nThe issue is that I want to include a note with the invitations asking people not to wear pastel colors to the wedding. My bridal party is wearing pastels (they were able to choose their own dresses/outfits) and my wedding dress is blush pink. The tradition is that you don\u2019t wear white to a wedding, but I don\u2019t really want someone to show up and accidentally match my or my attendants\u2019 clothes because they were avoiding white. My fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t know that my dress is pink but he was fine when I explained about the bridal party. Both of our sibling groups also thought it was a good idea.\n\nHis parents were not enthusiastic about it and my parents were downright offended. His mom basically told us we can do whatever we want but we\u2019re going to look incredibly rude for dictation what people wear to our wedding as guests. My mother screamed at me and called me an entitled brat. She said with the type of wedding we\u2019re having we have no right to ask anything of our guests, and we \u201cshould just be thankful people are coming because no one wants to smell dope at a wedding reception.\u201d When I told her my dress wasn\u2019t white she yelled at me about that too and then kicked me out of her house.\n\nI\u2019ve been rethinking the entire wedding. My fianc\u00e9 and I are cannabis enthusiasts and he runs a dispensary, but I can see how maybe some people won\u2019t enjoy that aspect so maybe my mom is right and we shouldn\u2019t have it. It would make me sad but I think I understand. I also am second guessing my choice of dress. My mom wasn\u2019t there when I chose it and she would have had a problem with it (kind of why I didn\u2019t invite her to come in the first place) but maybe she\u2019s right. It\u2019s not a black tie affair so maybe I shouldn\u2019t ask people to wear specific things.\n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: For those asking, yes the wedding is explicitly child free. No one under the age of 21 will be allowed into the event and we have already contracted a security guard to enforce this. Also, we are well aware that many people will not want to attend and we are fine with that. Most of my family lives on the other side of the country and we are planning a bbq next summer to celebrate with them. We expect about 40 people (our friends and some of his family) to attend and they are all cannabis-friendly.\n\nThe wedding is being held on our property and all of the cannabis will be kept and consumed outside. There will not be edibles available, and all of this will be be explained on the invitations.\n\nAlso this is the text that we wanted to put on the invitations about the dress code:\n\n\u201cAs you know, we have always enjoyed things that are outside of tradition. As such, you may see the bridal party incorporate some non-traditional colors for the ceremony, and we\u2019re asking guests to please avoid wearing light pastel colors.\u201d", "created_utc": 1675641972, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10urxf5/wibta_for_including_a_note_about_dress_code_with/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People can choose alcohol but second hand smoke harder to avoid. Think the edibles sounds a great alternative as puts choice in hands of people to consume or not.\n\nIt's not really a AH question.

And, ignore your family\u2019s opinions.", "I\u2019m also a very much pro canna\u2026.but I can 100% see why having that open at the reception would make people uncomfortable. \nIf the it\u2019s set up outside?

I'd suggest that being something that goes on the wedding site or word of mouth.  I'll also encourage you to make it known you are having the cannabis bar since that's not a typical thing to encounter at a wedding.  Yes, your mom said it in a judgemental way, but anyone with addiction issues or allergies should be aware so they can plan ahead and still celebrate you", "INFO: Are you expressly telling people in the invitation that you are having a cannabis bar so that they can choose not to attend? The smell gives a lot of people a headache or they just do not enjoy the smell. Also, as someone else asked is this a child-friendly wedding?\n\nIn terms of the dress code, it is generally unacceptable to tell people what colors not to wear other than white and in some cases, black for women. You can say \"casual\" or \"Black tie\" but given that your wedding is at the end of summer, pastels and brights are likely what people would wear.", "ESH. Your mom overreacted big time.\n\nBut. \n\nYou might want to ask yourself why it's so important that only you and the bridal party wear pastels. Are you worried a guest might be mistaken for a bridesmaid? Would you feel your wedding is ruined if that happens? Do you have a particular group photo in mind that will only look good if nobody is in pastels but the bridal party? What will you do if someone misunderstands or disregards your requested dress code? Confront them? Turn them away at the door? Give them a jacket to cover the pastel? What if someone wears a color you think is a pastel but they insist isn't pastel? Are you going to be so upset that you can't enjoy your day? How will you feel if someone tells you they can't come because the only suitable outfits they have to wear include pastels and they can't afford to buy something new? \n\nMy experience was this: I had a fall wedding. The bridesmaids wore brown. The groomsmen wore kilts. A couple female wedding guests also wore brown. A couple men wore their own kilts. And none of this detracted from the wedding at all. The day was amazing. My pictures look beautiful. And I didn't even notice that any of my female guests wore the same color as my bridesmaids until I looked at my wedding pics just now to see if anyone had worn brown. My wedding turned out exactly as I wanted it to be - better, even. \n\nIt's true that your wedding day will go by so fast that you'll barely remember any of it and won't notice half of what's going on. You might think that a guest wearing a pastel would bother you, but I can practically guarantee you that on your wedding day, you'll be so happy that your friends and family are there to celebrate with you that you won't notice or care what they are wearing.", "NTA but seriously, get over yourself. The bride/groom & wedding party will be at the front of the church/room/whatever and all eyes will be on them. No one will care that Betsy in row 15, seat 8 is wearing a pink dress.", "I don't see what a big deal it would be if people showed up wearing pastel; not everyone will, so what does it matter? So you might be a bit of an AH for requesting this.\n\nBut I was horrified to read about your mother's reaction. She screamed at you and called you an entitled brat? She then kicked you out of her house because your dress won't be white? That's not someone I'd want at my wedding \u2014 or in my life.\n\nNot sure about cannabis at the wedding; I'm not against, but wouldn't like being around the smell. Maybe have a reception, and then a party later with your pro-cannabis friends to celebrate?", "It does leave out a lot of wedding options if you take out ALL pastels. But isn't terribly rude if you give plenty of time. The wedding as a whole sounds very uncomfortable to me. I don't think I'd be okay attending but it wouldn't be because you asked me not to wear pastels. \n\nOn that part you could just say we respectfully ask for guests to not wear pastels as the wedding party will be wearing pastels if you really have to say something. NTA I guess?", "Eek.  No pastels is really hard.  Is there a different way you can differentiate the wedding party\u2026 embroidered shawls? Flowers in their hair? Something else?  \n\nI once showed up to a wedding in a beautiful navy blue retro dress with beading.  I felt absolutely lovely going to the wedding, thinking their colors were shades of green. Shortly after arriving another guest rudely said, \u201cYour dress is just like the bridesmaids.\u201d  I felt horrible.  I sat in the back, kept my shawl on, despite it being warm.  Then, when I finally saw the bride I apologized and you know how she responded? Great big hug, told me she loved my dress, and was glad I was there.  Late in the evening the bridesmaids even all pulled me onto the dance floor with them.  I had a fun night and am forever grateful for the gracious bride and bridesmaids!", "Soft YTA. You are banning an entire spectrum of colors from your wedding. I can understand white or beige or pink if that's the wedding party, but all pastels? Over the top. You're inviting people to come in red out of spite.\n\nYou've got a bigger problem than pastels. Your mom. Screaming and insulting and kicking you out are not acceptable behaviors. You've got a bully on your hands.", "\u201cPastel colors\u201d? That covers a rather wide spectrum, literally. Does beige count?

So everyone has to put up with your quirky little dope bar, but you won\u2019t let them wear their \u201cgo to\u201d nice outfit if it\u2019s fucking PASTEL? You sound spoiled and tacky as hell.", "ESH \n\nYour mom is an AH. She's judgemental and rude. You absolutely are in your right to wear whatever color dress you want....and blush is actually super popular right now for wedding dresses (it's not like it's neon pink....which would also be absolutely fine). Don't second guess your dress. And, because blush has become popular,  it's part of the family of what guests aren't going to wear. \n\n\nI don't think you are an \"AH,\" but I usually take that judgment as \"am I in the wrong?\" I do think you are in terms of eliminating an entire color palette. You'd also have people who start spending time wondering \"is this too light, and over thinking their choices\". Are pastels actually common for people to wear to weddings where you live or would you be unlikely to see it? Where I live, 90% of guests wear black, but reading reddit, that seems uncommon. Is it an evening wedding or afternoon...I feel like pastel is even less likely in evening. But, as this is the title question, I'm ruling ESH. \n\n\n\nAs for the cannabis, it really depends in your crowd. Is it mostly your friends who partake? Is it mostly family who doesn't? Is it all edibles or is smoking allowed? How strong is the smell? I personally can't stand the smell and wouldn't enjoy being there, but i know a lot of my friends would.", "I\u2019m concerned about the aspect of DUI from being under the influence of edibles since they take such a looooong time to kick in and people being inexperienced trying them. Also I hope this is no kids allowed. Never heard of a cannabis bar at a wedding. As for no pastels, that\u2019s odd because everyone was allowed to choose their own color, it\u2019s not like their all in yellow. To each his own I guess. NTA", "You will be giving off bridezilla vibes.If it\u2019s black tie, that\u2019s different. No pastels?\nThat\u2019s a bit off.", "Are ypu having kids at this wedding?", "ESH - Your wedding and you can have whatever you want. A weed bar and some vegan stuff hardly makes it that unique and really has nothing to do with the issue. \n\nBlocking out an entire color palette, in my opinion, is tacky. You can indicate formal or semi-formal etc, but no pastels in the *off chance* a guest matches your bridesmaids dresses. No. \n\nI also dont think as adults your parents should be screaming at you.", "YTA\n\nToo much, just for the sake of it.", "YTA - do you want people to come share your day? Or do you want props to make your day perfect? Honestly I don't understand the hoops people make guests go through these days. Invite people - and be happy if they attend.", "ESH it's an obnoxious ask. Do you want your guests to have fun or be props for your \"perfect day\". Your mother made valuable points, but she was an AH in the way she communicated them.", "Soft YTA. I honestly think the wedding sounds great, but asking people not to wear pastels is a bit much. Enjoy your special day!", "YTA \n\nNo pastels. That is 90% of the colours people would wear to a wedding. \n\nMost women wear softer pastels to a wedding. \n\nNo pinks or something would be fine. \n\nA cannabis bar. Different. Whatever.

I\u2019m not a huge fan of wedding with specific dress codes but no pastels is pretty doable, so NTA, especially because there\u2019s the potential for free weed.\n\nJust one suggestion: make sure your venue is aware of the cannabis bar, as that code affect their insurance. I\u2019m sure your fianc\u00e9 is very aware of the legalities/liabilities, and it doesn\u2019t sound like they have an issue. Just two cents from a pothead insurance agent lol.", "ESH. Yes, it's rude to tell your guests what to wear to your wedding.

It's the same reason you don't serve Limburger cheese or durians at a party that is not specifically organized around Let's All Enjoy the Stanky Thing That Nevertheless Is Enjoyable.  Also, does the venue even permit smoking indoors?  (Disregard if the cannabis bar is edibles only.)", "Yeah, I\u2019d have a problem with the cannabis bar. Pot stinks. I understand why you want it, agree with the person who suggested edibles, as long as it\u2019s legal where you are. I know of a wedding where pot caused a big family rift when the people who couldn\u2019t be around it for professional reasons had to abruptly leave the reception.\n\nAs an older, more conservative person, I don\u2019t agree with the idea that brides can dictate what the guests wear. As Miss Manners says, they\u2019re guests, not props.\n\n*However* I often check with the brides mum - I\u2019m the age where it\u2019s my friend\u2019s kids getting married - just to make sure I\u2019m not wearing the wedding colours or something. I think it would be ok if you mentioned it to some people who might spread it around that pastel colours might not be the best choice if they have another choice.\n\nI think a blush pink wedding dress sounds lovely. There\u2019s no reason why every wedding has to be the same. Best wishes for a long and happy life together.", "YTA. Because it is rude to wear white to a wedding. But if you\u2019re choosing to wear a nontraditional color, you have to accept that other people might coincidentally wear the same color. It\u2019s an easy thing to accept if you remember that your dress will probably be the most elaborate and that everybody\u2019s focus will be on you. In the unlikely event that anybody is slightly confused about who the bride is (maybe a +1 you\u2019ve never met), will your day be unsalvageable? If you think so, you need to recalibrate yourself before you drift irreversibly into bridezilla territory.\n\nCredentials: I wore a peach pink tea-length dress and my fitting was ruined by my judgmental mother.

(For example, I have asthma and struggle terribly around smoke of any kind.)", "NTA about a dress code, that\u2019s pretty common. But if you don\u2019t already plan to, you absolutely must put on the invitation that there will be a cannabis bar. Smokers have a tendency to think that everybody who\u2019s not super against it is as cool with it as they are, and that\u2019s simply not the case. I don\u2019t care if people smoke but I can\u2019t be around it, it aggravates my asthma and gives me a headache. Plus honestly I hate the smell and I know I\u2019m not the only one out there. I would respectfully decline to attend your wedding and hold you no ill will for doing what you want on your special day. If I wasn\u2019t warned ahead of time and arrived to a cloud of smoke, I\u2019d be pissed. So just. Do you, have the wedding you want, make sure you give people all the information they need to make their own decisions, and also keep in mind that not everybody is going to want to come and don\u2019t hold that against them.", "NTA as far as wedding request go this is pretty tame.", "NTA just.\n\nYour wedding so you choose.\n\nGiving a dress code is not unusual, and actually helpful for guests.\n\nYou want cannabis and it's legal?

Ideally ask bridesmaids to stick with a smaller subset of colours, eg yellow and blue, and ask guests just to avoid pastel yellow, blue and pink.

You remind me of a friend- I would be thrilled to help her achieve her esthetic for virtually no effort.", "OP I **love** the sound of your wedding.\n\nThe pastels rule was a bit much, but I think you've heard enough on that by now.\n\nMostly, I just wanted to say how cool your cannabis bar sounds. I **CANNOT even** with all the nay-sayers here \"ohhhh, but what if someone doesn't like the smell, or has a headache, or is allergic?\"\n\nYou're doing it *outdoors*. Nature's *already* full of smells, allergens, and people bitching about their heads. You go **right ahead** and have an awesome wedding, and ignore the wet blankets.", "I think that when you are hosting an event the goal should be to ensure that your invited guests are comfortable. You know your guests best. If you are inviting people who will be cool with the cannabis bar and being told which colors to avoid, go for it. However if there are a segment of guests (parents, relatives, etc.) who would be uncomfortable or offended by these aspects, it may be best to avoid them and save them for a smaller or different celebration (perhaps with just friends?)", "NTA. Your mom needs to remember it\u2019s YOUR day not hers.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding. No one bats an eyelid if a bride doesn\u2019t want people to wear white, I\u2019m not sure why this would be controversial. \nI wonder if maybe your mum has been stewing over your unconventional wedding for a while and has just blown up over this one as a \u2018last straw\u2019 (the fact that she started arguing about the dress when you mentioned it suggests it isn\u2019t just about this) but honestly I\u2019d categorise that as a her problem. \n\nSomeone else suggested framing more as a \u2018do\u2019 than a \u2018don\u2019t\u2019 on the invite and that sounds like a good idea. Asking people to wear their brightest colours or black and/or white or silver and/or gold or all denim (kidding) probably feels easier than people trying to avoid something and worrying about what \u2018counts\u2019. As long as you don\u2019t make it too confusing or difficult I don\u2019t see a problem - dress codes at a wedding aren\u2019t so unusual.", "I seem to be an odd one out but NTA.\n\nJust say \"Please /try/ not to wear...\" and go into it fully expecting some people will, and then don't freak out at or even mention it to anyone.", "YTA. You're banning an entire spectrum of colors. That's ridiculous. \n\nI wore a black wedding dress. My attendants wore black dresses. Half the guests wore black. No one was confused or upset about \"accidentally matching\" anybody. They all knew who was getting married.\n\nJust stop.", "YTA.", "You seem deeply exhausting to be around. I mean, do whatever you want for your wedding, and outlaw pastels or whatever, but consider strongly what actually matters to you. I can\u2019t decide if you\u2019re the AH or not.", "Also pastels aren\u2019t non traditional and who cares people wear the same color as the wedding party??", "Why would it be bad for people wear vaguely the same colors as the bridesmaids? Wouldn\u2019t that be a more cohesive aesthetic anyway?", "Please wear your dankest green.", "Mild YTA. Work in your color scheme into your invites. Most people get the hint. Guests don't tend to wear bridesmaid style dresses.", "I'll get down voted for this but I'll say NTA. I don't  see the difference between this and any other dress code ppl like to add to their wedding.\n Having said that, don't  get surprised or offended if your wedding ends up looking like a funeral cause everybody went to the logical and easy conclusion that black is ok", "You are free to do you, but don't expect your guests to not do the same. You are going non-traditional, so just roll with your guests doing the same. If you want to avoid your wedding dress color, just state that, but you can not tell people to avoid all pastels, because you just crossed into Bridezilla territory, and I know that is not your intention", "NTA: here\u2019s my two cents\u2026 it\u2019s your wedding and you\u2019re free to do whatever you want. \n\nBut if people don\u2019t follow the dress code, oh well. \nIf they don\u2019t like the cannabis portion? Sucks to be them! Again, it\u2019s your wedding. \nWhy does this world have to be constantly catered to everyone else? \n\nLet this be for you and your partner!!", "N T A. You can have whatever you want on your invitation. I would include a pastel chart if you are that bridzilla about it. Have you really thought thru the weed idea, tho. Are you going to be selling it? Giving it away? You said west coast so obviously USA I know in my state you can't give weed away. That's a felony. How are the laws in your state on that?", "NTA, but why not put a little card in the card with the actual bridal party colors on it? \u201cThese are the colors being worn by the bridal party, please indulge us by choosing something different.\u201d Something like that? Although to be honest, I think you\u2019re overthinking it.", "NTA.\n\nThis wedding sounds lit AF and I'll come if your lame family won't. God forbid you have a wedding you guys might actually enjoy.", "NTA because you can do what you want. But remember, doing what you want has consequences. For example, the kind of wedding you are having is your choice but MANY people would not feel comfortable in that environment. So you may have the wedding but miss out on the important people.", "Cannabis is the only outdoor event, and it will be easy to avoid (not near the main entrance/exit). We expect most people to not come and we\u2019re fine with it. We don\u2019t want to use edibles as the increases the risk of someone accidentally ingesting something they didn\u2019t choose to consume. With keeping all of the cannabis at the back of the barn away from the entrance, people who want to consume it will have to exit the barn and walk all the way around it. We are not allowing cannabis to be removed from the designated smoking area, so the risk of marijuana smoke floating around people who aren\u2019t choosing it is low.", "I feel like this is a good compromise, but I also feel like if it\u2019s asked months in advance how hard can choosing a non-pastel dress for a wedding be?\n\nI understand that it limits some dress options, but again, the wedding is 9 months away. It cannot be that hard to find a dress that looks good without it being pastel. \n\nHad she sent these out a month or even two months before the wedding I could see it being more difficult, but again 9 months is plenty of time to research a dress or go dress shopping and find something that doesn\u2019t clash with the brides theme.\n\nThat being said, I love your idea for there to be something else that distinguishes the bridesmaids. A shawl or flowers in the hair sounds like a lovely idea! \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with NTA, just because given the time frame the request is not as difficult to abide by.", "I\u2019ve seen cards with little circles of the colors the bridal party is wearing to show guests exactly what colors not to wear. It makes it easy with no room for confusion!", "Eh it's not that hard. Wear a jewel tone (saturated blue, green, red, purple, orange etc.) or black. \n\nPastel is shit you see in a baby nursery, colors toned down mixed with white, it's not that hard to avoid.", "\u201cTheir wedding\u201d \n\nExactly. It\u2019s THEIR wedding.", "Because this is the wedding we want to have. We are having a sober bbq next summer on the east coast for most of my family who live there. The family and friends we have in town are all friendly to cannabis use.", "Well, \"no pastels\" is broader than that, but also personally I think once you discard a certain number of wedding traditions it gets weird (not AH necessarily) to cling real hard to other ones - especially if you're ditching ones YOU don't want to do and keeping ones that dictate what OTHER people do. I understand people may have some traditions they want to incorporate into their weddings even if they ignore a bunch of other ones, but \"cannabis bar\" is making me picture a pretty relaxed vibe that \"major color palette off limits to all guests\" does not fit into.\n\nIn case this perspective helps - I got married at a summer camp. I did wear white, though it wasn't a very \"bridal\" dress. We put a lot of thought into what to list as the \"dress code\" on our wedding website (not the invitation - this level of detail doesn't belong there IMO) because I really wanted people to be comfortable in the setting, wear shoes they could walk in, and not be worried about ruining their clothes if they sat on a bench that still pretty much looked like the tree it was made out of. I was also hoping, though, that as a group we would all look a little \"wedding-y.\" We ended up using the phrase \"summer camp semi-formal\" and most people wore the kind of thing I imagined (sun dresses, khakis with button-down shirts, etc.). One friend wore one of those t-shirts with the image of a tuxedo front on it, not what I was going for but who cares! He had a great time, we were glad he was there, and I have no idea if he felt out of place but I hope not. In retrospect I wish I had not said anything about the dress code at all - I was trying to help people know what was expected but that made-up description for it probably just confused things more. OP, I really think you'll enjoy the day more if you let go a little bit in this area, let your guests wear what they feel good in, and enjoy their company.", "I kind of like the idea of saying \"please wear *x*\" instead of saying \"please don't wear *y*\"  - it sounds kinder. Not this this is a great parallel, but I've been to funerals where the family asks guests to wear a specific color or be colorful rather than black or drab.  Kinda the same thought?  Kinda sorta.", "This might be a dumb or naive question, but I live in a state where weed is still illegal, and my experiences are pretty limited.  Anyway, would a cannabis bar have like, a cannabis sommelier or expert to help guests make the most of things, or avoid something that may be too much for them?  Just curious how it works!", "Cool!", ">>No one wants to go to a wedding that smells like a  whole burlap sack of skunks started farting\n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Right, like \"please wear the deceased's favorite color to honor them\" or something. I feel like this does fall into that category, like at weddings people are always worrying about upstaging the bridal party so i think saying \"we would love it if everyone would be loud and weird because this is a nontraditional event\" is totally appropriate to put on an invite.", "No it\u2019s not", "I've successfully offered edibles at parties and just had a lot of information available (like written on the bottle/stuck to the plate.)\n\n>\"This product contains marijuana which is psychoactive. If you aren't a frequent flyer, you should only eat one and wait *a minimum of 2 hours* before going for seconds.\"\n\nAnd then each one of your gummies/brownies/whatever has 7.5mg of THC and 7.5mg of CBD (1:1 greatly reduces the chance of someone ending up anxious/paranoid, too fucked up to function, super sleepy, etc.) And you don't offer any of that food item without marijuana, avoiding the \"regular brownie vs weed brownie\" issue. It's a lot of management, but would be worth it to me to avoid cannabis smoke at a wedding. \n\nOP, have you considered 510 or even flower vaporizers if your fiance owns a dispensary? As someone who can't drink, I like the idea of a cannabis bar, but as someone who also can't smoke and uses other ROAs for marijuana, ick.", "One of our friends is a budtender in a dispensary and we contracted one of his coworkers and one of their security guards to work the wedding for this reason.", "It could work, right?  As long as it's understood that like pretty much any  dress codes or suggested attire, there will be people that ignore it and do what they want.  Just edit the photos after...", "I completely agree.  If something so insignificant as someone wearing the same color as her completely ruins the day she's focused on the wrong things.", "Got married on the beach. Wore my bathing suit with a beautiful cover up (patterned, but the base color was peacock blue). Maybe 10 guests. After the \"I do\" we went swimming. Then out to dinner. Wouldn't have wanted it any other way.", "Budtender, that's the word!  Seems like a good move for what you're considering.", "I mean, I've been to weddings where everyone was supposed to wear a Halloween costume. And Renaissance festival weddings. Pretty much yeah, as long as the bride doesn't throw a fit if people don't follow this, she's firmly out of asshole territory to me. Gotta admit I'm still struggling on the whole \"cannabis wedding\" thing but i guess i probably wouldn't be friends with someone whom a large portion of their personality would literally kill me so \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm old enough that most of my social circle is already married, so I don't (thankfully, lol) attend many weddings these days so don't exactly know what the current trends are.  But yeah, as long as bride and groom realize and accept that people might not follow their requests, and they don't make an issue out of it on the big day, I feel like there are way worse wedding stipulations couples could put out there.", "We laughed about it at my brother\u2019s wedding. He had a small but formal wedding in Vegas. His bride\u2019s sister was the MOH, and my husband was the best man. We were told cocktail attire for guests, so I wore a little black dress (evening in Vegas - totally acceptable color). Except . . . it turns out that the MoH was told to buy a little black dress. Our dresses were almost identical. We\u2019re both very tall blondes and about the same size. The only difference is that I was 6\u20192\u201d in heels, and she was 6\u20194\u201d in flats. We thought it was hilarious, and so did the happy couple!", "Cool thanks", "My partner has an enormous family (on both sides) lol, so we've gone to pretty much a wedding a year since we got together. I hope someday we will tie the knot, but also i dread it given the amount of weddings we've been to. I feel weddinged out.", "I'm sure the enthusiasm will come when it's your own wedding! And in the meantime, you have a million AITA posts to learn some do's and don'ts, lol.\n\n Personally I always thought eloping sounded pretty good, comparatively.", "I don't quite want to elope, but.....for reference, my entire family, both sides, is less than 30 people, including people married in, cousin's kids, whole shebang. And I don't actually keep in contact with really any of them. My partner's one cousin has over 100 family members at his annual memorial day party. My sister got married on the side of a mountain with no one but immediate family and six of their closest friends and like that sounds perfect."]}
