We understand the growing pains about moving in, so when they started doing some light repairs and decorating involving hammers at around 0700, we sucked it up and let them do what they needed to do. At the time I was working 12 hour shifts and wasn't sleeping well anyway, so it didn't make a huge difference to me, but my wife and son have always been nightowls so waking up at 1000/1100 is normal for them. \n\nWithin a few weeks of living here, the two of them came knocking once each, upset because I was playing with my son and his running disturbed them. Both of these incedents took place before 2000 so not early but not really late either in my opinion. \n\nWe implemented a new rule which we called \"quiet feet\" by 2000 every day. And for a five y/o he does pretty well with it. \n\nOne more incident about two or three months ago, same story, but only it was earlier in the day, probably around 1400.

Or son used to get woken up all the time while he napped when he was younger. And it's not like we're cleaning the carpets every day or thumping around all day long. We've tried genuinely to keep as quiet as possible...but also...he's five. He's going to want to run around and play. \n\nSo am I the asshole if I pull the plug on being courteous and careful about how loud we are being?", "created_utc": 1686967307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14begam/wibtah_for_not_caring_to_quiet_down_my_activities/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can't keep a 5 year old still its what they do and you handled their complaints and even gave them a number to text you and you'd try to keep it down. But in terms of pulling the plug and saying fuck it, neighbors can be your best friend or make your life hell and they have a colicky newborn. Try to empathize with them and remember what it was like when you had a newborn. It's a lot of sleepless nights and crying and then you throw colic on that and it's 10x as hard. Then you work for an hour to get a baby to stop screaming, they finally shut their eyes and just then your neighbor chooses that moment to deep clean their carpet (obviously you didn't plan it, they know that deep down too, but it still would be irritating to anyone just because of the circumstances)", "Welcome to condo living.

Tell them what the building quiet hours are, and that you\u2019ll be quiet during that time. Apologize for any inconvenience they may feel about your decision, then request they no longer contact you. Let them take the matter up with the building manager if they feel so strongly about it.", "NTA. I've been living in apartments my entire adult life and noise is just something that you have to deal with, especially in the middle of the day. If the noise was happening in the middle of the night I would understand your neighbors' complaints, but it's not reasonable to expect silence in an apartment all day long.", "NTA. This is part of apartment living.  You're doing normal things during the day.  If wife was shampooing carpets at 2am, then yeah, that's not okay.  But what you've described?  Normal.", "NTA. They made the choice to be in the downstairs unit in an apartment. \nIn my opinion your very thoughtful gestures have given them a sense of entitlement and control over your life. \nStop.   Straight up tell them that you\u2019ve tried ti be accommodating but since that hasn\u2019t been appreciated, that ship has sailed. \nNo good deed goes unpunished.

With an HOA they need to make complaints through the HOA, it's what they're paid for.", "NTA", "NTA... you are happy to work around reasonable requests.  I'd just say that if asked. Every time I plan to relax outside on my deck, someone starts up something... woodsplitter, chop saw, motor bike, lawnmower... some day I will find a moment of peace.", "NTA, you should let them know that they\u2019re setting themselves up for failure trying to do silent naps and they should thank you for your help making a good sleeper", "Yes! Absolutely an AH!", "I've flipped through our HOA guidelines and haven't seen anything about that, so default would be the city ordinance which is 0000. I don't think malicious compliance is in order here though.", "My wife made this point to me. Our son had to get over the loud noise wake ups pretty quick because our particular spot had a lot of traffic and the constant grass cutting in our area. I truly do feel bad for disrupting a nap, especially if the baby is still colicky, but you're right...how are we supposed to know? My wife said she would have happily stopped with the carpets and all they had to do was ask.", "Yeah that's where my point of contention is. On the one hand, I do remember what it's like and am not setting out to make their lives intentionally that much harder. But also, being mindful hasn't gotten us anywhere and now we're catching attitude  instead of being approached with understanding. I've spent a lot of my life bending over backwards for people (strangers and familiars alike) and it's gotten me no where, so I don't want to be a doormat either. Thanks for your thoughts!", "Problem is they have not used it once. We're more than willing to exercise a little more caution with our floor-noise level. But there is zero proactivity on our neighbors part. Only complaints after the fact or trips upstairs. We can't begin to guess when their baby is sleeping.", "I agree - my point is more that you're already being neighbourly and considerate, and well within bounds moral and legal. Mid-day requirements for quiet, are - frankly - bullshit entitlement, newborn or no. \n\nThe thing that irks me on this is that it's quite plain that had your neighbours spoken to you about colic and their little one, you'd have made more efforts to quiet your household activity without being asked or complained to. Your neighbours suck, IMO.", "7:00 is also too early to be making noise in a lot of places, at least the hammer construction noise that you brought up early on", "I had a colicky baby, which is literally hell. They are probably tired and cranky. It could have nothing to do with the baby napping and more to do with them being over stimulated or keeping them awake. Either way, they had your numbers, just text. It's not your job to text them.", "Fair enough. My last apartment my upstairs neighbor would flick cigarettes into our backyard and when they moved out, the new ones were worse and would party at all hours of the night. I'm a huge fan of picking my battles and if their only fault is they make snarky remarks to yall about behavior that is normal it may be worth just apologizing without meaning it and living like you normally would. You're not breaking any rules so they have 0 legs to stand on they should have gotten an upstairs apartment if they were worried about noise", "If the issue persists it might be worth it to try to level with her, let her know that you understand her frustration as a parent but you're doing the best you can. It might humanize you to her and make her a little less adversarial.", "You sound like nice people, trying to be nice. The benefit of a downstairs condo, is you aren\u2019t walking up stairs everyday. The con is the upstairs noise.\n\nTrying to negotiate with your neighbors about your noise after the fact is a never ending expectation, one you can never meet their expectations.  Because their expectations are to not climb stairs AND have zero noise.\n\nUnfortunately you\u2019ve opened the \u201cjust call us\u201d door, but instead need to offer \u201canything goes\u201d during these hours, and then live your life as normal people during those hours, rebuffing their complaints with its 1400, we can\u2019t help you as an answer.", "Yeah that's a good take. And their first trip upstairs I said in passing \"yeah we will try our best to keep it down, but also...he's (at that time) 4 and 4 y/os run. So maybe a more detailed conversation about what exactly we do to cater to their wants might level it a bit.", "It's firm but understandable. I like it. Since they haven't utilized the call us method. This might be more appropriate for us. Honestly we stress way too much about how loud we are being and it gets tedious.", "NTA  - i have lived in a downstairs apartment and it was very very loud through no fault of anyone staying above. Made a decision after 2 years to move out and luckily found a top floor apartment. I do try to be consciously quiet especially after 10pm but i want to live my life during the daytime"]}
