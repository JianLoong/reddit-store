His mom maxed credit cards his whole childhood and was always in debt. This has made him anti-credit. My mom also racked up credit debt and when I turned 18 had me get multiple credit cards that she ended up taking and maxing out. When I met my husband at 23 he paid my 6k in credit debt and I could never thank him enough.\n\nNow I(28f) have been thinking about trying to get my credit score raised and thinking about Christmas(we have a 2y/o) and I figured I would get a card completely in my name so that I could get all the presents I want to be able to provide our little family. I wasn\u2019t going to tell him, as advised by a few people in my life, but after applying, being approved, and having the card I felt bad not saying anything. So I told him and he\u2019s very upset. \n\nI work and make 70% of the income, he receives SSI and stays home with our child. He said the only way he will forgive me is if I cancel the card and get a card that he agrees on. Not wanting 2 inquiries on my credit back to back, I told him I would not be canceling the card and told him I am an adult and I am allowed to make this decision considering I make the bulk of the income. He said I am tyrannical and abusive (because I said I make the bulk of the income even though I said I\u2019d never throw it in his face) and that I\u2019m treating him like a 50s housewife. I tried to compromise and said I\u2019d give him full access to the acct and make sure I asked before using it but it\u2019s not good enough for him. He says he\u2019ll never forgive me and that this will hang on our relationship forever as a betrayal of his trust. \n\nAs for the 50s housewife comment, we live with his mom who does most of the cleaning and if she or I want a chore done we have to ask it\u2019s never initiated by him. I feel really hurt by his comments and need to know, am I the asshole?\n\n\n\nEDIT: I am learning a lot from these comments, so thank you. I had intended to use the card and pay it off by January then not use it again until next Christmas, but it seems like that\u2019s a bad decision. I didn\u2019t know carrying a balance for more than one period could negatively affect the credit. I do know using more than a certain percent is bad I had no intention of using the entire credit line. \n\nI don\u2019t think my husband is lazy, he takes great care of our son. It wasn\u2019t necessary to mention his household input and I\u2019m sorry I did. I also agree I should have talked to him in the first place that is my biggest regret in this situation.", "created_utc": 1668741448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yy9ovq/aita_for_getting_a_credit_card_without_asking_my/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
