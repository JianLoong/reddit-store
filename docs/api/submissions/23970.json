Did you stay with your Dad growing up?", "NTA\n\nFrom what you\u2019ve described, your mother isn\u2019t a nice person.  You don\u2019t owe her anything.  We can\u2019t choose out family, so don\u2019t feel bad when they aren\u2019t nice people.

Women lose Social security benefits because of child rearing and lower earnings over their lifetime. You should want her to get he most she\u2019s able to. It has nothing to do with your step mother and your dad doesn\u2019t care one bit at this point.", "NTA, we went through this with my mom. She kept badgering my brother and he finally just said it seems like you\u2019re more concerned with a few extra $ than your kids\u2019 grief\u2026 but FYI your mom is legally entitled to the benefit and it doesn\u2019t affect your stepmom. If she needs a copy of the death certificate she can figure out how to get a non certified copy without being an immediate family member if you\u2019re not willing to provide one. I guess it really boils down to if this fight is worth the damage it may do the relationship you have with your mom.", "NTA\n\nNot your responsibility. Whether she is legally in the right or wrong is not your problem. You don\u2019t have to facilitate. She sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA. You don't like her so why help her. Get her out of your life", "Fuck no. Your mom sucks.", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't need a death certificate for SS survivors benefits.    SSA knows he is dead.   Usually the funeral home reports it.\n\nShe does need an official certified copy of marriage certificate and divorce decree.\n\nI just finished filing for benefits off my ex-husband, so I know what I am talking about.\n\nWhere she has to go to get those depends on the state where she lives.\n\nShe also doesn't need a lawyer to deal with SSA.   This is a very cut and dried process.", "She actually can't because she's no longer next of kin. It would have to be from me or my step mother that she got it. I suppose she could lie about it though...I could definitely see her doing that", "Then OP's mom can get a lawyer, OP has nothing to do with it and should not get pulled into her monther's affairs.", "Then she can do the leg work and figure it out. It\u2019s not up to op to have things over.", "Lawyer but no one\u2019s lawyer. The mother cannot get benefits. She remarried which prevents her from getting any survivors benefits from an ex. She\u2019s SOL.", "Then she can get her own copy of the death certificate.  OP isn't obligated to provide it.", "If I had my way, neither of those women would benefit from his death. They both have behaved like money hungry assholes. My step mom was so bad that my step sister & I both cut contact with her 2 months after he passed. \n\nIf it's legal, my mother can do it herself. I refuse to help her gain anything from it.", "Legal doesn\u2019t make it right!", "In the US, you can collect social security spousal benefits if you were married for at least 10 years. A lot of women in the age bracket to receive social security had much lower income, gaps in employment while raising children, don't have enough quarters to collect their own social security, etc. If their spouse trades them in for a younger model, they at least get benefits for the work they put in to make him successful. Just like working for a company with vested retirement benefits, you don't lose those funds if you go on to work for another company. Future marriage does not negate the time put in with the first spouse either as long as you meet the vesting requirement.\n\nThe OP is NTA by refusing to help his mom. If she needs paperwork, she can consult a lawyer to determine the legal avenues to acquire it. She should leave him out of it.", "According to her the man at the SS office told her she could regardless of them being remarried. Idk if that's true or not, but she will die on that mountain.", "Yes if your married for 10 years you get the benefits. It does not decrease your spouses (if there alive) or their other spouses benefits in any way. You basically get one social security it might be your own level, or your spouses, or your ex spouse whichever is highest. But it has no effect on the other persons own benefit level.", "They had joint custody. He paid her child support every month like clockwork (actually wrote the check himself), had me every other weekend & 2 weeks in the summer.", "In the US you can get a death certificate for anyone.  But just let mom do whatever she wants.  No skin off your nose.", "Where do you live? In the UK anyone can order any death certificate. It costs \u00a311. An extra \u00a33 for them to search the records if you don't know the document number.", "He was just asked to provide a document that he probably has easy access to and is public record in most places anyway. He's hardly being pulled into her affairs", "you're a fully kind of laywer that didn't even ask where they are but seems to know which laws apply somehow.", "Well, the Social Security Administration disagrees, so surviving spouses and ex-spouses who qualify can collect. For me, any benefit to the elderly is appreciated.", "Yes it does. The benefits wouldn\u2019t reduce anyone else\u2019s. There is literally no reason why someone shouldn\u2019t take all of the Federal benefits available to them.", "She can if they were married longer than 10 years. You have no say.", "They have to have been married for 10 years and she can't have remarried before the age of 60 (50, if disabled.)", "The one consideration is that there is a marriage penalty when married spouses both collect social security. You can each receive your full entitled amount if you are single, even if you live in the same home with some other single senior receiving social security. If still married, the government reduces the amount because , I'm not sure why, something to do with the patriarchy or some other nonsense from the '40s. Best advice to receive full benefits, divorce and continue to live together as single people.", "your mum might not be a good person but don't act like your dad is a hero for paying child support to the parent with majority custody \n\ni'm confused about the cheque thing too - who else would write the cheque?", "That varies by state.  In my state death records are public records, but most states restrict who can access them for a period of time.", "Only next of kin can get a death certificate with cause of death for a period of time because cause is made public. In my state, that is 50 years after the death.", "OP's not saying they can't go get benefits. Just that they can do it themselves. Just because they're entitled to something by the govt doesn't mean OP has to go help her with it. Her mother can go get a lawyer and go through the expensive route.", "So mommy dearest can get a lawyer and figure it out. Op doesn\u2019t need to help if they don\u2019t want too.", "The SSA doesn't require OP to provide mother with a death certificate or any other documentation of any kind.", "there's also no reason why OP should help her mother do it if she doesn't want to. that's OP's mother's problem, not hers.", "Op doesn't have any say, but also doesn't have to help her mother get the benefits", "There's a death certificate I want to get but there's a 25 year restriction in that state.  The death was in 2002 so four more years before I can get it.  In my state anyone can get anyone's death certificate.", "Didn't say she did.", "I missed added info that anyone can get death certificate that do not list cause of death, for that initial period of time. After that, it is public info"]}
