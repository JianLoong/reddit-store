The mother is seriously unhinged.\n\nFWIW, I usually find stories about hair to be ridiculous. I haven't read one where harm was actually done. Haircuts and dye jobs are there until the hair grows. I suffered chemical burns on my scalp after my aunt botched a permanent. I just had to suck it up, because, you know *family.* I also had bad haircuts and botched dye jobs. The only thing hurt was my ego.", "That\u2019s just what she says to the *teacher.* Imagine behind closed doors\u2026.", "CPS doesnt just take children away. They try to fix the situation at home first (unless the child has no food and is a very unsafe situation). Even drug addicts get a second chance with their kids if theyre willing to change. They\u2019ll tell her that she needs to do more with her child before taking her away. \nIf the child is taken away, its because theyre being abused or not having basic needs met. I should know, I\u2019m a foster kid myself! \nIt is neglect that this white woman leaves this child to have unkempt hair.", "I\u2019m pretty sure the principal will report it. I thought teachers had to keep the principal in the loop about these things. I\u2019m just happy it\u2019s been handled either way. \nEdit to add that in another comment she says she already reported the mother for abuse the first time the mother said she refuses to do her hair.

I can speak specifically to Canada. If you find a unconcious child and there isn't a adult around you have implied consent to perform first aid, even if there was an adult around you could argue that the adult wasnt capable of consenting as who would just let their unconcious child not get medical care unless they weren't mentally fit to consent.\n\nSecondly cultural protections specifically around hairstyles are very strong in Canada. If a child wanted a culturally/ racially appropriate hairstyle and their parents neglected those rights(which they extra ones if they are adopted kids or in foster care) it could be considered abuse. \n\nI'm pretty sure a 14 year old can consent to a haircut even against parents requests to the service provider just as girls that same age can get birth control without their parents knowledge.\n\nIn Canada there would be no worthwhile court case. You're clearly American because they think the answer to everything is to sue them but in most Commonwealth countries that have public healthcare there isn't much worth suing for as you can for the most part only recover money or future damages ,loss of income, injury and the settlements are usually so low it isn't worth the lawyers time to take it on contingency or it isn't worth paying 500$ an hour over the period of years.\n\nIf a parent requested the school to not let theyre school provide their child with hygiene products, let them shower, wash their clothes at school, and feed them and in the process also did they're hair it would not be considered assault in general.\n\nBraiding hair is part of a proper hygiene routine for a alot of black people.", "The kid is 14 or 15.

French braid pigtails looks great on all, IMO. They're my go-to for long runs.", "Right, but the issue we're discussing is how to convince a racist white monster to let her  Black teenage daughter have braids. There's not an issue of cultural appropriation here, so your point is kind of out of place.", "Not specifically viking thing, but I've seen some Nordic hair tying techniques get claimed as \"black hairstyles\" even when they're not and people get backlash for it. \n\nThis includes stuff like tying your hair into a lock-like (not quite dreadlocks but close) style with string, and even a technique where you essentially use crochet hooks to do your braids (though this one is way more niche). \n\nThen we have the so nicknamed \"elflocks\" which are admittedly ***similar*** to dreads to the untrained eye. So I genuinely don't see a point in gatekeeping hairstyles in the *modern* age. \n\nMaybe try not to hurt your hair, but as someone who regularly bleaches and colors...eh, do whatchu want.", "Greek braids can be seen in sculptures going back thousands of years.

OP didn't say their country, so idk specifics. Just trying to provide a general case argument.  \nI don't think there is a high likelihood of this resulting in a real court case, but it's worth considering the possibility. It's probably more likely to be dropped as soon as it reaches a judge, but that's never certain. In the worst-case scenario, with an age of consent of 18, disregarding and going against the explicit wish of a parent could carry heavy consequences (even if the minor consents). It's not unheard of for an unreasonable case to still carry penalties due to the letter of the law. There wouldn't be any damages to speak of, but the law could (in some cases) carry minimum penalties to a change such as assault and battery of a minor. Even without any penalties or charges, being involved in a court case (especially as the defence) would be a headache and expensive to hire lawyers.

It mats.", "The structure, thickness, and overall texture of the 3A-4C hair types is better suited for these type of braids. It is very much a cultural thing - these styles work best both practically and aesthetically with _their_ natural hair. You can make cornrows with fine, straight hair, sure, but the results may vary. That's part of the reason why people from other cultures (who had thinner, straighter hair and/or lived in colder climates) never really adapted it historically. \n\nPersonally I hated getting cornrows from my mother during hot summer weeks (thin blonde hair). it was practical but very uncomfortable and honestly, wasn't very flattering even though she did fancy elaborate swirls and all that.", "History is not gatekeeping.", "Go on and put braids with added hair on white straight hair.

The biggest issue is that it involved irreversible change to the hair, while this situation does not.
