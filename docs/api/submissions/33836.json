Marie's family are Catholic and since she heard that I was going to be alone for the holidays, she invited me to spend Christmas with her family in Normandy. I told her she didn't need to do that as I am Muslim and don't celebrate Christmas but she insisted. I went to Normandy with her. \n\nBefore we got there, Marie told me she had warned our racist uncle \"Jean\" (55M) to be nice. I am very well acquainted with him as he always makes jokes about me being Turkish by showing common household objects like tables and saying \"You must not have these in Turkey\". He once kept me from entering the church where one of my distant uncle's funerals was held in because \"it's not for people like you\". He also calls me a \"civilised\" Muslim because I choose not to wear the hijab. He's the worst and one of the reasons why I didn't want to go to Normandy. \n\nWhen I got to my cousin's house, her parents immediately told me that they had told Jean and his wife \"Helen\" (50F) (who were hosting Christmas dinner) that I didn't eat pork (religious reasons) and fish (I'm allergic) so there would be nothing to worry about. \n\nWhen we got to Jean's house the table only had dishes with pork and fish except for a few salads and desserts. I just had some salad. \n\n15 minutes later, Jean brought out a meat pie and told me not to worry because it didn't have pork in it, only duck. I had some and tasted something similar to pork but just assumed it was the spices mixed with the duck. Once I cleared my plate, Jean informed me that I had just eaten pork and meat pie. I was livid but because I didn't want to make a scene, I simply told Helen (who was the one who cooked it) that dish was great. \n\nThe next day, there was a gift exchange. I gave everyone the gifts I had bought for them and even received gifts as well, which I wasn't expecting. All the gifts I got were amazing and very well thought out except for Jean's gift which was a tourist get up with the ugly I love Paris sweater, the beret and staple red scarf.
