I live completely alone but because my mom is half French, I was lucky enough to have some very extended family members here. \n\nI got very close with one of my cousins \"Marie\" (18F) as we live in the same city and share very similar hobbies. Marie's family are Catholic and since she heard that I was going to be alone for the holidays, she invited me to spend Christmas with her family in Normandy. I told her she didn't need to do that as I am Muslim and don't celebrate Christmas but she insisted. I went to Normandy with her. \n\nBefore we got there, Marie told me she had warned our racist uncle \"Jean\" (55M) to be nice. I am very well acquainted with him as he always makes jokes about me being Turkish by showing common household objects like tables and saying \"You must not have these in Turkey\". He once kept me from entering the church where one of my distant uncle's funerals was held in because \"it's not for people like you\". He also calls me a \"civilised\" Muslim because I choose not to wear the hijab. He's the worst and one of the reasons why I didn't want to go to Normandy. \n\nWhen I got to my cousin's house, her parents immediately told me that they had told Jean and his wife \"Helen\" (50F) (who were hosting Christmas dinner) that I didn't eat pork (religious reasons) and fish (I'm allergic) so there would be nothing to worry about. \n\nWhen we got to Jean's house the table only had dishes with pork and fish except for a few salads and desserts. I just had some salad. \n\n15 minutes later, Jean brought out a meat pie and told me not to worry because it didn't have pork in it, only duck. I had some and tasted something similar to pork but just assumed it was the spices mixed with the duck. Once I cleared my plate, Jean informed me that I had just eaten pork and meat pie. I was livid but because I didn't want to make a scene, I simply told Helen (who was the one who cooked it) that dish was great. \n\nThe next day, there was a gift exchange. I gave everyone the gifts I had bought for them and even received gifts as well, which I wasn't expecting. All the gifts I got were amazing and very well thought out except for Jean's gift which was a tourist get up with the ugly I love Paris sweater, the beret and staple red scarf. I thanked him to which he replied \"Since you're a tourist in this country\". I'm not, I have French citizenship through my mother, but I just awkwardly laughed and moved on. \n\nWhen I got home, I told my mom everything and from what Marie tells me, she exploded on Jean and Helen, calling them awful names. I received a message from them today calling me ungrateful for making \"a big deal out of something small\" especially when they had the kindness to invite me over. They also said I hadn't acted like anything was wrong the entire time I was in Normandy so it was \"bitchy\" to tell my mother about it. \n\nSo yeah, AITA for telling my mom what happened even though I never mentioned I was uncomfortable to the family?

Yes, how dare you tell your mom the truth about the CONSTANT BARRAGE OF RACISM AND BIGOTRY you received while there. Fuck that.

He deserves it.\n\nIt's fine that you didn't mention how disgusting their behavior was to the families that were hosting you.  (It would have been find to tell them off too.  The choice was yours.)  You're 18 and you were under their roof.  \n\nKnow that good hosts would have had your back when Jean only provided food he knew you couldn't eat, gave you the appalling gift, and when they saw him feeding you a pie they knew contained pork -- a taste with which you're unfamiliar because you don't eat it.\n\nOne hopes that Marie is deeply ashamed of her family's behavior and is part of a more enlightened generation.\n\nI'm so sorry you went through that.

Deliberately making food you shouldn't eat, and lying about it, that's seriously f'd up. Snarky gifts and racist comments? Bah. Publicise it far and wide, make everyone know what a pair of utter creeps they are. Put it in their local paper, post it on their fb pages. Humiliate them and make it sting."]}
