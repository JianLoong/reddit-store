{"id": 28429, "submission_id": "17254n4", "title": "AITA for standing up to my in-laws?", "selftext": "I (27f) have been married for 7 yrs to my (28m) husband, and we have 3 kids. About 5 yrs ago we started having problems with FIL, he was very demanding and entitled when it came to our children. He refused to follow our basic rules when I came to our kids. Ex- he gave us his word that he wanted to watch our kids one night and then tried to find a babysitter so he could go to a party with his gf. Our 2 kids at the time were 3 yrs and 1 yr. We had never met said babysitter. Then started abusive phone calls to my husband, and trying to get in the way of our marriage. Fast forward 6 months later he\u2019s in our living room screaming at me (not at my husband) because I\u2019m keeping his grandkids always from him. I am not the type of woman to be intimidated by a man yelling at me, and I didn\u2019t back down. My husband and I parent as a team and we decided he was no longer allowed to watch our kids overnight for safety concerns. Then came all the family harassment in the form up group messages just directed at me, excluding me from family events, telling my husband to put me in my place. Essentially my husband\u2019s whole family turned on my because I didn\u2019t let my FIL do whatever he wanted with my kids. \nIn the last 4 yrs it has been relentless harassment from the whole family to both my husband and I. We both went no contact with FIL and SiL due to their behavior. 1 yr ago my husband was deploying and at the send off ceremony my FIL showed up (uninvited) and started screaming at me and trying to grab my youngest out of my arms. We were in a huge crowd of hundreds of people and obviously there was a scene. I got my kids and myself to safety, I am also in the military. My children and I didn\u2019t get to see my husband off because of this. My husbands plane hadn\u2019t even landed and I was in a sheriffs office filing a police report for harassment. You don\u2019t mess with my kids. Now the whole family is claiming I filed a false police report and trying to have me arrested. Also I have unbiased witnesses that came forward and gave statements to the sheriff. Over the next 11 months I had DHS threats, financial threats, open stalking, and harassment from this family. No one from the family reached out to check on my kids or myself during the entire deployment. My husband is now home and it has just gotten worse. He has started standing up for me and our kids throughout the yrs and doesn\u2019t want any relationship with his father or sister. I have have no direct communication with them in yrs until send off. My husband was also the one to communicate with them. However now the family is claiming I\u2019m controlling him, he\u2019s in a unsafe marriage, and that I\u2019m monitoring his phone. At this point I\u2019m just waiting for a welfare check to be done on him from this family. I had a hard childhood and they are claiming I have unresolved trauma because \u201cno one cuts there family off unprovoked\u201d.

Those types of people can\u2019t stand to see someone thrive and be happy outside their circle of misery. \nYou, being an \u201coutsider\u201d, are a threat to their dysfunctional family. You are strong, with a backbone; they are used to people cowering and caving. They\u2019ve thrived off of keeping their abuse, control and threats in the dark, they\u2019re not used to having someone confront them and bring other outsiders (such as the police) into it.

All they did was show everyone how screwed up they all are. \n\nPlease talk to your commands and base legal to see what your options are. You do not want your in-laws threatening your children and affecting your careers. You did the right things by going to the sheriff\u2019s office and filing reports, getting corroborating witnesses, etc, but it seems your in-laws need restraining orders, and whatever else that can be thrown at them. To make sure they can\u2019t get on base (crazy gets desperate for drama and attention), take whatever photos you have of them to the PMO/MP/security building. I\u2019m sure you already have daycare and the school covered, but make sure they know not to release your children to your FIL or anyone associated with him. \n\nDon\u2019t block their numbers, just silence them, as they may send threats or other incriminating messages that the authorities could use.\n \nYour husband has your back and you clearly have his.

Second, you and your husband dictate where those kids go. That is your legal right in every nation on this planet until they are adults. If someone forces them away, that is kidnapping. So you have every right to say that those kids go nowhere near your FIL. Finally, the harasment, you dealt with it better than I would have, take the high route, don't let these selfish people bully you into an unwanted situation. Ganging up on you is a sign of defeat. In this case, they need strength in numbers because their argument has no legs to stand on. Keep resisting them OP, you'll do great.", "Nta", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDocument all of this, and get a restraining order against them. And then keep reporting every time they contact you.", "NTA. They sound like an unhinged bunch that ended up with one apple falling farther from the tree. I'm glad your husband is sticking up for you. Honestly, if possible, I might even consider moving so they don't know where any of you are.", "NTA\n\nTheir behaviour is deranged. Cut contact, watch what goes on social media and look at restraining orders if needed.", "You clearly know the answer to this. NTA.\n\nIf it is possible to get a restraining order against these terrible people for stalking and harassing you, I encourage you to do so. Block them on phone, social media, e-mail, everything else.\n\nPursue criminal charges for the time he assaulted you at the ceremony, and for every subsequent assault.", "NTA", "NTA I\u2019m hoping your husband gets stationed in Germany or Japan, where you (& your family) can follow him far away from his family.", "NTA and you may need to get a restraining order.  His family sounds dangerous.  Block the whole lot of them.", "NTA", "NTA. this family is hella toxic and from the looks of it they allow the dad do whatever the fuck he wants. I suggest to move because it can really escalate to something more bigger than just no contact w you. Hope everything goes well", "No judgment, as this story sounds extremely one-sided.", "In OP's shoes, I'd be seeking to move. The military aspect makes that both harder and easier in some ways. Harder bc it's not up to you - can be hard to coordinate two transfers. But easier bc once the military figures it out, it will take care of the rest.\n\nBut this does sound like a situation where geographic separation would help tremendously. There are a lot of family problem AITA posts where geographic separation would solve the issue.", "Yeah, this. \n\nSounds like this abuse is just going to escalate, so now is the time to start keeping detailed accounts of every single instance of harassment for the inevitable involvement of the authorities.\n\nEdit to add judgement: NTA. Obviously.", "Restraining order is definitely the way to go. Sounds like your kids\u2019 safety is in jeopardy.", "This. Is the way.", "This.
