I was raised by my grandparents for most of my life so I\u2019m not very close to my mom but now that I\u2019m in my 20s, she doesn\u2019t mind being around me. \n\nShe married Dave two years ago and Dave has a 7 year old, Alex. I was very concerned when mom told me she was getting married to a guy with a kid but she said that Alex is with his mom 90% of the time and they\u2019ve agreed on her having 0 responsibilities for the kid. Whatever it\u2019s their relationship. \n\nBut my mom called me saying that Alex\u2019s mom is sick and so they have to take Alex for longer than usual and she\u2019s exhausted. I sympathized with her. But she calls me every single day just to complain about Alex or her husband. \n\nShe stopped helping out with Alex after he had a tantrum. Ok fine but Dave has to be at work by 8am. Alex starts school at 9am. So Alex has to wake up extra early and hang out with his dad at his job then Dave has to quickly drive him over to school. Then Dave finishes work at 5 but Alex finishes school at 3 so Dave has to pick him up during work and Alex has to stay with him till 5. Dave and his ex wife cannot afford help and Dave tried asking the school for other options but they aren\u2019t getting back to him. \n\nNot only is this stressing Dave out, but Alex seems miserable. He\u2019s so tired by the time they get home that he\u2019ll fall asleep instantly. Mom thinks he\u2019s being rude because every time she tries to get him to eat dinner he cries about being sleepy or wanting his mom. So she stopped making him dinner. And when Dave got mad at her she stopped making him dinner too. Dave knows how to cook for himself but he works during the weekends so while he does make Alex pre packed meals, sometimes they aren\u2019t enough. Alex knows how to make basic stuff like sandwiches but he\u2019s so upset about his mom that he won\u2019t eat unless someone gives him food. This is all stuff my mom has told me, I have never met Alex.\n\nI was neutral till my mom told me that last bit. I get that she doesn\u2019t want to take care of a kid but Alex\u2019s mom is apparently so ill that her son can\u2019t be around her for at least a month. The poor kid must be so scared. \n\nI told my mom this the last time she called and she immediately cut me off and said 1. It isn\u2019t any of my business, 2. The kid isn\u2019t being neglected, his dad\u2019s taking care of him, 3. She isn\u2019t his mom, 4. She tried to help, but she can\u2019t do it. \n\nI told her that she could try harder but she got really upset and told me that she made a mistake confiding in me and that I\u2019m just as awful as my dad for pressuring her to take care of a child she never asked for. That really hurt. I guess I was being too pushy. I just feel really bad for Alex.

She never wanted kids. Great. Then she should have been more careful about birth control. She still doesn't want kids. Great. Then why on Earth did she marry someone with a 5 yr old (now 7). Your mom only cares about herself. Getting her to change isn't going to happen if the last 20+ years are any indication.", "It's pretty clear she had barely any time with you OP if she's this unfamiliar with what 7 year olds are like. \n\nLike, fine. It's a crappy situation, she has to do things she didn't agree to, whatever. That doesn't give her the right to just not make a very overstimulated stressed out SEVEN year old dinner? And then expect sympathy for it?? Is she taking parenting advice from the Brothers Grimm????\n\nBut she clearly just called you to vent and didn't want to hear any narrative that didn't place her as the victim. \n\nHonestly if I was the mother, I'd want to someone to tell me what's happening so I can figure out if there some other arrangement that would be better for the kid's (physical and mental) health. NTA.", "Wow your mom is something. Hopefully Dave will realize how she is & she won\u2019t have to worry about helping out anymore because she will be divorced and alone.", "NTA- you mom sounds selfish. it\u2019s only ONE MONTH and she can\u2019t help out a little more and try to be more understanding of Alex\u2019s situation? (and Dave\u2019s for that matter) When she got into a relationship with Dave knowing he has a young child, she should have anticipated at least helping out minimally. It\u2019s not like she has to fully raise a toddler with him. That poor kid is going to resent her if he doesn\u2019t already, and probably Dave too for allowing this to happen to Alex. I hope he gets to go back to his mom soon. That\u2019s just so unfortunate and I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with her raising you too.", "No dude, your mom\u2019s the AH. In a big way. What an egocentric selfish way of thinking.\n\nNTA for saying something she obviously should have been hearing for years.", "NTA - While she didn't asked for taking care of the kid, she did decide to engage in a relationship with the father, which should be obvious that the kid goes along as a \"package deal\"... If you don't want to take care of a kid, don't get into a relationship with a father that has a kid, it's really as simple as that..!!", "NTA\n\nYour mom doesn't want to parent Alex - okay. She doesn't have to. But she refuses to help in any way. Hell, I suspect a random neighbor would be more helpful than her - and nicer about it.", "NTA. Your mom is, though. If it was none of your business, she should have kept her trap shut.", "NTA.  Dave needs to get a divorce, Alex needs counseling, I hope the ex-wife gets better, and you need to go LC/NC with your mom.", "NTA\n\nForgive me for saying it, but your mum is a piece of work, if she doesn't want kids or to be responsible for them, then she shouldn't be involved with someone who has kids. \n\nIt's really very easy not to be in a relationship with someone who has kids. She chose to, which means she has to step up. She can call back to all the agreements she likes, but these are not normal circumstances, and honestly, she deserves to be dumped with her behaviour. \n\nAlso, just for you, I'd advise dropping the rope, drop any effort, you are her kid not her therapist or venting board (regardless of how she wants to pretend things are).", "NTA, what does she mean with a child she never asked for. She married a man that has a child. What did she expect to happen? She had a choice. She choose the man with the child. She sounds awful. I am glad that you had your grandparents", "NTA. I don't want kids, but I don't want a kid to feel bad about existing, either.", "NTA. \n\nI can sympathize with your mom to an extent. It\u2019s a huge change to their lives. \n\nBut at the same time, damn, she won\u2019t even make the kid a couple of sandwiches for the week or Mac and cheese or really anything?  That\u2019s taking it too far.", "NTA.\n\nbut your mom is a serious AH. i dont think her relationship with Dave would last might longer and that would be for the best, especially for Dave and Alex. that poor kid would be going through a lot right now. great work on Dave, he deserves a better partner.", "NTA.  Poor Alex.  His mom is sick (so scary) and his dad's wife hates him and makes sure he knows it.  She really could do better.  But it's not in her wheelhouse, I guess.  Your mom is also lacking in empathy.  I don't foresee this marriage with Dave lasting very long.\n\nWhen will people realize that marrying someone with a kid means you will definitely be dealing with a child?  Like WTF.  It's logic.  I hope Alex's mom gets better.", "NTA, and your Mum makes it your business every time she complains to you about it all.\n\nIt's ridiculous because this is all her own making. She won't look after him before and after school because she doesn't like kids even though she married a man with a child. Because she doesn't look after him around school hours, he's exhausted and falling asleep. And because he's falling asleep and feeling emotionally wrung out, she's punishing him by refusing to feed him.\n\nThe kid just needs some TLC and a safe place to rest. He's only 7 and he's probably scared that his Mum might never recover, at which point he'll have to live with wicked stepmum for the next decade.", "NTA she needed to hear this. I don't want kids either, but if I was in the same situation as her, I would step up and take care of the kid. I wouldn't be happy about it but I'd do my damndest to make sure the kid didn't know how I really felt.", "I get that your mother isn't into kids. Dave and your mother shouldn't have gotten married; she shows a disturbing lack of empathy and sympathy for Alex, and honestly, Dave might want to send the kid to his parents, or somewhere that the kid will be fully taken care of. How Dave tolerates this is beyond me.    \nAnd no,  you're NTA, but you're in denial of the level of callousness that your mother has towards this kid.", "NTA. Your mum, your rules", "NTA. Your mother is from our point of view but I think she really doesn't have the capability to handle kids. And while it is easy to blame her or call her an AH, it sounds like she wouldn't be able to handle this even if she would want it. And you know this best. You basicly told us that your mother was told to not terminate when she was pregnant, also by your father. Yet you were raided by your grandparents? If your father was so adamant, why wasn't he taking more care of you?\n\nIn other posts btw with stepkids etc, people here are hating on the spouse who wants to keep the kid at the other parent if they are sick. Dave may have volunteered to look after his son, but normally the one whose time it is should be making sure the son is taking care of properly.\n\nIn this case Dave volunteered and he should do better. If he had not met your mother he would have to do all that by himself anyway. If he can't do better due to work he and the ex wife should have made better arrangements. So I guess he is the biggest AH in this story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

She should never have married a man with a child.", "NTA. You're right and I don't think you did anything wrong by vocalising this.\n\nYour mom sucks for marrying a guy with a 7 year old child and then behaving this way towards the child.

What happens if Alex\u2019s mom dies? \n\nI\u2019m sorry she was a shit mother to you, you deserved better.", "Hopefully he will rectify that soon", "I mean, It\u2019s so easy to pop some easy mac in the microwave or make a few sandwiches one day that he can eat whenever. Or even just buttered noodles or chicken nuggets or any other random stuff little kids like. The fact that she won\u2019t even do that is what pushes just way too far, in my opinion. Who won\u2019t make a sandwich? Lol"]}
