That's his problem .  Maybe he'll get off his lazy ass and find a job so he can pay for board.\nYou've been generous letting him mooch off  you  for this long", "NTA\n\nThe girlfriend needs to go immediately.  She is not helping the situation. You agreed to HELPING your brother. If he does not want your help, then he needs to help himself. 30 days get a job or gtfo. \n\nAlso, your parents should be trying to help as well. He\u2019s your brother, he\u2019s their kid. But brother is 18 soooo... he needs to figure some stuff out.", "NTA-tough love. Give him ample notice and then get him out. He\u2019s taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA.  Tough love time.  Your parents were correct in kicking him out.  If he doesn't want to go to school or get a job, then they (the parents) don't need to enable such irresponsible behavior.  You made the mistake of letting him move in with you.  That essentially meant that the lesson your parents were trying to teach him....\n\nWell, he never got the message.\n\nHe NEEDS to be homeless for a while.  That is the only thing that will wake him up.", "NTA kick them out", "He's made it clear that he's just going to milk the situation for as long as he can. You were stupid enough to go along with it and not set up consequences. Serve him with eviction papers and get him out, otherwise you'll be going back and forth until you've worn yourself completely down, and he'll still blame you in the end! The time for giving him yet another chance has come and passed.  NTA, but you are also just causing problems for yourself. No more pleading, time to let him fend for himself.", "NTA.  I get he's your little brother, so I understand why you would feel bad, but he has made a choice to sit around and mooch off of other people.  It is not your responsibility to take care of him.  If he has no other choice but to get a job in order to have a place to live, he may actually do so, but as long as you are letting him live with you with no responsibilities and quite clearly taking advantage of you, he will not make any changes to what he's doing.", "Nta just kick him out if he is doing nothing", "NTA for wanting them out but don't illegally evict them. You have to go through the court process. Otherwise they could turn around and sue you for a lot of money.", "NTA its great that youre prepared to help, but you cant help someone who doesnt want to be helped.

It will help him long term", "NTA. The gf is paying her way, she's not an issue. However, gf may want to reconsider her criteria for bf material. \n\nGive your brother a deadline to get a job, or move out. Since he's been there a while, you may have some legal issues.\n\nI'd also check your lease. Usually there is a clause saying that anyone not listed on the lease can only stay for a certain period of time. You may be in violation of it and could lose your apartment. Cover your bases.", "You tried to help but he doesn't want to do anything.  I understand your concerns but it's time to cut the strings to him.  I'm sure it wasn't an easy decision for your parents but now you understand why they kicked him out because you're walking a mile in their shoes.\n\nDo what you need to do.  Hopefully, he will open his eyes not having a place to live and get his act together.  It's either sink or swim it's his choice.  NTA", "NTA, he needs to learn that weed ain\u2019t anything. Also with no job and dropping out of school how is he affording said habit? Kick him out\u2026 give the gf longer as she has clearly been paying you something and trying to pay her way.", "I hate to say this, but that might be the wake-up call he needs. He's old enough to have a job, has decided school isn't a priority, and just wants to live off someone else and smoke weed (which *will* make it harder for him to find a job). It might be time for little brother to get a shove into adulthood and realize that actions have consequences. While it would suck that he may not have anywhere to go... sometimes the force to sink or swim is what it takes to make someone grow up.", "NTA - You are offering to house him for free as long as he is in school. You are offering to house him if he gets a job and pays their share. Those are both incredibly fair and generous offers. He is choosing neither. I assume if he chose either option your parents would likely also take him back in. He needs to understand that being a freeloader is not an option in life.", "INFO: He dropped out of high school and is a weed chimney. Is it possible that he's self-medicating for a mental illness? (That's pretty much the same thing I did when I was dealing with untreated depression and anxiety at that age.) If he is, you can find him a sliding scale clinic to help him get into treatment and become a functional human. Just Google \"sliding scale therapy\" with your zip code, or look at your county health department. (Ignore the ads.)\n\nIf he's just not interested in working, school, or dealing with the real world, then it's probably best to give him a written deadline and stick to it. Consult your area's eviction laws for guidelines on how to do it right.", "INFO: is marijuana legal where you are and does anyone else in the building use it?", "NTA. You're not responsible to house him as his sibling, and since he's eighteen his parents are only obligated to house him if he's in high school, which he isn't. And kicking him out now will benefit him in the long term. It'll be much easier for him to find a job now than it will be in the future when he's 25-30 and has never worked.", "NTA\n\nYou are enabling him.", "This!!!", "The parents ARE trying to help, but sister is sabotaging their efforts.  I wouldn't say 30 days get a job or gtfo.  I would say 3 days, maximum.  Temp agencies can find work for you in less than 3 hours.  30 days?????  Ridiculous.", "Dude needs a serious kick in the ass but I really don\u2019t expect that from his 25 yo sister. My guess is once girlfriend is out of the equation his life may get a little more boring/challenging. OP agreed to help brother, not his gf. She gotta go!", "While I agree with most of this... I've been working with a temp agency for a little while now and they've struggled to find positions I could fit in with my experience (even with years of office experience). It depends on location to how fast a temp agency can really help."]}
