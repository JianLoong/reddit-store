We have a 8 months old daughter. This year we\u2019re going to throw a Christmas party at a fancy Resort that my in-laws love, to celebrate our daughter's first christmas. Most of my in-laws will be there. Ellen\u2019s parents, siblings, grandparents, etc etc. From my family's side, however, it\u2019s basically only me and my brother and some very distant relatives (not gonna get into all that).\n\nMy brother, let\u2019s call him Franky (28M) is a great guy. He doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, he has a long sky-blue mullet and he\u2019s always the tallest man in the room, probably the smartest too. Honestly, he got all the good genes. I love the dude.\n\nAlso, he\u2019s the type of dude that wears shades at night and he\u2019d put eyeshadow and a pearl necklace to work. Very simply explained: he\u2019s the opposite of my in-laws in many ways (political views and lifestyle/gender expression, to sum it up in three words), and I\u2019m NOT ashamed of that.The stupid conflict: Ellen texted my brother his invitation, and she was emphatic on the dress-code. The resort attire is casual, but the restaurant/event-room policy is quite formal. Franky teased her about it, and he replied something like \u201cCopy that, my captain\u201d with a saluting emoji. He said he was joking, Ellen thinks he was making fun of her request. I texted him right after that \u201cFranky the dress-code is important, you can\u2019t be the only one that gets kicked out, grow up and don\u2019t embarrass me\u201d.\n\nLater that week, Ellen told me that she called Franky and he was awful. I had to intervene because she was in tears, so I facetimed Franky. He told me he was joking at the beginning but then Ellen said he needed to cut his hair (She told me it was \u201cjust a suggestion\u201d) and that she offered to buy him proper attire (which I think is a nice thing to do), and that\u2019s when he said \u201cfuck off, I\u2019m not touching my hair\u201d. He said Ellen told him \u201cdon\u2019t complain if you get kick out for your f\\*ggy hair then \u201d (my wife said that it's NOT true, she said \u201cugly hair\u201d which is not nice ofc but not a slur). He took all of that the wrong way and we had a fight. I might have said some hurtful things and things got heated quickly to the point where I basically told him not to come if he was making such a big deal out of it.\n\nThat\u2019s it. It ain\u2019t that deep but this would be my first christmas without him. After the conflict we\u2019re not speaking. All my friends know Franky and the group chat is roasting me. They think I\u2019m a bad brother and an AH but they probably just know his version of the story. The dress-code is something out of my hands and it\u2019s NOT hard to follow.

You described your brother perfectly. Different, with swag but also very smart and funny. He got the info about the dress code the first time around and took it in good humor. But it wasn\u2019t enough for your wife. She had to insist. She had to call him and bother him again and again. That\u2019s offensive (I\u2019m pretty sure she did use the f word, which is disgusting). And then you had to call him to defend the indefensible, and said awful things why? It\u2019s absolutely your loss. That fancy place will not see the coolest guy ever. And you\u2019ll miss your brother for Christmas. Start preparing your apologies. You AND your wife.", ">Ellen said he needed to cut his hair\n\nEllie is the asshole, so YTA by extension. Imagine demanding someone cut their hair because you're going to some cookie cutter all-inclusive.\n\n>I might have said some hurtful things and things got heated quickly to the point where I basically told him not to come if he was making such a big deal out of it.\n\nOh wait, sorry, you're just straight up an asshole. Here's hoping your \"great brother\" Isaac joins the rest of your family in cutting you off.", "Good to know you gave them new names (edited per OP's request)\n\nMy comment from your last post remains, YTA. You and your wife escalated this beyond what was necessary. It shouldn't have gone anywhere after the first miscommunication where she thought he was making fun of her. \n\nIterating a dress code is one thing but telling someone that their style is going to embarrass you, calling their hair ugly, is a low blow. And I'd be interested to know what these \"hurtful\" things you said to him were. \n\nDress code isn't hard to follow but dress codes also have interpretation for self expression as well.", "YTA. We both know that your wife told him to get a haircut regardless of how she said it, frankly I\u2019m inclined to believe your brother. Where does your wife get off? Telling him how to style his hair? \n\nYou say you\u2019re not embarrassed by him, but you let your wife talk to him that way. You seem more intent on spending Christmas at this fancy resort then in making sure your brother feels included. I don\u2019t blame him for getting angry. You sent out the invitation to everybody. You told them the dress code and you should\u2019ve left it at that. You\u2019re singling him out and neither you or your wife has the right to tell him how to style his hair. I think your wife is more concerned about what her relatives would think of your brother and I think that\u2019s what concerns you more.", "\u201cHe took all of that the wrong way..\u201d\n\nNo, he didn\u2019t. He took it in *exactly* the way your wife meant it.\n\nYour wife and her family are bigots\u2014just think about all the wonderful views they\u2019ll impart to your child. You need to stop this here and now, stand up for your brother, and nip this bigotry in the bud. Otherwise you\u2019re not just TA,  you\u2019re just as much of a bigot as your wife. YTA", "YTA. His initial \"Copy that, Captain\" was a perfectly fine and lighthearted response to the dress code request. There was no need for your wife to get offended and definitely no need for you to immediately come at him with \"grow up and don't embarrass me.\"\n\nI don't know what kind of fancy resort cares about tall men with long hair, but if you found one that does then you suck for even having a party there.  I support \"formal dress code\" for **attire,** but that's the end of it.", "You have the absolute coolest brother and you\u2019re fobbing him off for such rude, judgemental in-laws. And your wife?? Suggesting he change his body to fit her idea of \u2018normal\u2019 is unbelievably fucked up, I\u2019d have walked then and there. He\u2019s is being an adult, he\u2019s being himself which is an extremely mature way to behave and was being respectful whether your wife wanted to believe him or not. You\u2019re the ones being childish, judgemental and rude.", "YTA...You pressured him, cornered him, and ridiculed him.  Of course your wife used the slur.  You say you love your brother, so show it.", "YTA.\n\nYour wife was a complete jerk. This is a time when it\u2019s ok to not be on a team with your wife.\n\nIs there a dress code? Yes, is frankly an adult yes. All you had to do was share the dress code. Saying anything more was a whole other level of asshole. \n\nApologize to your brother and beg him to come. \n\nTell your wife to accept him as he is and stop being an asshole.", "YTA. What do his hair and make up or jewellery have to do with a dress code? Your wife sounds like an intolerant busybody too.", "You AND your wife are indeed the AH's here. Your wife is also VERY much out of line even suggesting your brother cut his hair! WTF is she??? Why does she think it's okay to tell anyone how they better look/dress? If your brother gets kicked out (Which is highly unlikely in this day & age, most establishments don't want that smoke or bad press) that's on him, not you. You claim to support your brother yet you all are shaming him for his expressions which he is 1000% entitled to do. If the dress code is super enforced then again, that is your brother's problem not yours. He's allowed to be who he is without some SIL telling him he better do this or that and don't complain when... FOH! You both could learn from him, evidently.", "YTA. I\u2019m 100% sure that your wife said the slur and she\u2019s lying about saying it. It was clear to me that originally your brother was joking about the dress code and not being serious. I\u2019m sure you brother would have dressed formally, you could have even double checked in a casual way about it, if you were really that concerned. \n\nYTA, your wife is TA and your brother is awesome.", "YTA - Uhh yeah, you\u2019re ashamed by your brother. Just admit it. But you\u2019re a huge AH, as is your wife. \n\nWhy are you berating this poor guy? You invited him, he knows the dress code. Well, we know why\u2026 because you care more about what some rich AHs think than about your own brother.", "YTA, you need to support your brother because Ellen is degrading him for who he is and being a huge AH. My husband and I are super close, and if he did what she is doing,  we would have hard words. Seriously, what kind of person did you marry, and how can you possibly tolerate this behavior.\n\nShe was completely out of line for suggesting he cut his hair.\n\nShe is an AH for stressing the dress code beyond a communicate of the facts about the venue.\n\nYou reacted by saying \"hurtful things\" instead of apologizing.  We all notice you glossed over what those words were while you very explicitly shared his \"fuck off\" response btw.", "YTA\n\nSo he gave a light hearted response to being notified of the dress code, and you and your wife opted to berate and denigrate him.", "YTA. If you can\u2019t accept your brother as he is, then why in the hell did y\u2019all invite him anyway to an event with your wife\u2019s family. Your brother is the only honest person in the room\u2026\u2026", "YTA\n\nYou say you love your brother, but you let your wife talk to him the way she does and its clear she does not appreciate his sense of style.\n\nHe can dress formally with his hair. He can even joke around while doing it.\n\nAnd if he doesn't want to, and doesn't want to go into those spaces, but otherwise is able to attend the rest of this holiday, he can do that too. He's an adult.\n\nStop pretending you love him. You don't.", "YTA. Sorry dude but your wife went in combative no matter how you look at it, and instead of calling him and being honest about it being a bit stricter and what the expectation was she went after all the things she, and clearly you, don\u2019t like about him. You are embarrassed because you would have not had to write how your wife was not wrong with every sentence if you weren\u2019t. Own that. \u201cIt was just a suggestion he cut his hair\u201d and whether she said fugly or not she called it ugly. To her it is, to him it is an expression of who he is and you just told him it\u2019s not good enough for your posh in laws. Go spend your holiday at your resort and leave your brother, who appears to be more genuine than you and your wife put together, and maybe during that time contemplate how you are a bad brother and that his version of the story may be the real non rose coloured view you are sharing here.\n\nYTA, big time and so is your wife.", "INFO: Does your brother have a history of being contradictory when it comes to dress codes? Because if not, I'm not understanding why you're both treating him like a child who is incapable of following a dress code.", "YTA\n\nIt's hard for me to believe that your brother just made up the fact that your wife called him a slur. You are being fooled by crocodile tears", "YTA. Cut his hair? For a Christmas party? Who the hell does she think she is?!\n\nIf I were your brother I wouldn\u2019t even want to spend Christmas with her. You\u2019re not ashamed of him but you can\u2019t defend him and you uninvited? Yes of course", "YTA\n\nFormal dress code - ok\n\nWife texted invite and emphasises dress code - ok, could be good to give him a heads up\n\nFranky acknowledges the info - great\n\nYou text him to say \"Franky the dress-code is important, you can\u2019t be the only one that gets kicked out, grow up and don\u2019t embarrass me\u201d. - hmmmmm\n\nWife then calls and nags, does not want Franky to be Franky and implies he is incapable of choosing the right clothes AND he needs to cut his hair - NO!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou \"might have said some hurtful things\" which we all know is Reddit talk for \"I was absolutely vile but I am going to justify it\" - NO!!!\n\nEnjoy your party without Franky but surrounded by rich old women with a blue rinse clutching their pearls.", "Your wife cares more about appearances than about time with family. Period. By your own definition, your brother is a good person, but he's now banned from Christmas because he won't look the way your wife and her family want him to. Your wife should be ashamed and, like others here, I 100% believe she used a slur with your brother. \n\nHowever, you're the one who should be most embarrassed and ashamed. This is your brother and you got angry with him and said awful things just because he won't change himself to suit your stick-in-the-mud in-laws. And yes, asking him to change his appearance is asking him to change himself. He isn't good enough for you all because of how he looks. \n\nGuess what? Your daughter is going to end up growing up without an awesome uncle because of you and your wife's behaviour. You'll end up without a brother but hey, at least he won't be able to embarrass you at family events anymore. \n\nYour brother's character is what matters, and he sounds amazing. Your wife and her family, however, have terrible characters if they believe a person is automatically unworthy because they don't dress, look or act the same as them. And as for you, your character speaks for itself in the fact you would treat your brother, someone you describe as awesome, like he is less than for the sake of a bloody resort. Seriously, where is your loyalty? \n\nAre you going to teach these values to your daughter. \"Now honey, remember that it doesn't matter how nice a person is, or how good of a person they are, the way we decide if we like them is by judging their clothes and hair. Don't worry about their insides, it's the outsides that matter. If they aren't the same as you, make sure to demand they change themselves for you or for our family. The dress code of a resort is more important than spending time with family. Oh, and do feel free to discard your family if they do give in to your absurd demands. Now, mommy has some nice slurs to teach you. Pay attention to the f one, it's the one she uses for your uncle, not that you'll be meeting him.\"\n\nYTA and so is your wife.", "YTA. Informing him of the dress code is one thing, but asking him to cut his hair was WAY out of line. On top of that, offering to \"buy him something propper\" may sound nice on the surface but is actually pretty insulting, sounding like she thinks he doesn't understand what to wear. YOU might not be ashamed of him, but it sure sounds like your wife is.", "You and your wife are most certainly the AHs in this story.  If you accept him as he is, then allow him to show as he is.

If he gets kicked out that is on him.", "I just heard your side of the story and it really doesn\u2019t make you look good YTA you and your wife went too far. All you needed to do was send the dress code, emphasize that the place is actually strict about enforcing it and stop! Then it\u2019s up to the ADULT you invited to decide how they will handle it. She went way too far insulting his hair, asking for a cut, offering to buy clothes as if he were unacceptable or incapable or figuring it out.

He chose not to stand for it.  She told him the dress code via text. He acknowledged receipt of that info, perhaps not in the way she wanted. She couldn't let it go. We choose to include people in our lives for who they are - not who we can force them into being. You and Ellen assumed quite a lot and were treated like the assholes you were being. Some lessons are hard learned. I hope you recognize your fault here and apologize to your brother for trying to micromanage and disrespect his autonomy.", "YTA. I think you need to grow a pair.

You are the ones with the issue. \n\nBut if you are holding your event someplace where any non conforming gender expression gets you kicked out then you're the asshole for picking that place. \n\nAlso, maybe just throw a Christmas party.

WHY did your wife need to call him and go in on the dress code again? She certainly didn't need to suggest a hair cut, that is patently a rude thing to do. He didn't \"take it the wrong way\" it was a rude thing for her to say, and if she said ugly, he certainly didn't take that the wrong way because she admits to saying that and it was an insulting thing to say. \n\nYour wife was wrong in every step of this, even if we only believe HER version of events.

Again, her version of the story she is a full on AH.

He doesn\u2019t go unnoticed, he has a long sky-blue mullet and he\u2019s always the tallest man in the room, probably the smartest too. Honestly, he got all the good genes. I love the dude.  \n\nAlso, he\u2019s the type of dude that wears shades at night and he\u2019d put eyeshadow and a pearl necklace to work. Very simply explained: he\u2019s the opposite of my in-laws in many ways (political views and lifestyle/gender expression, to sum it up in three words), and I\u2019m NOT ashamed of that.  \nThe stupid conflict: Ellen texted my brother his invitation, and she was emphatic on the dress-code. The resort attire is casual, but the restaurant/event-room policy is quite formal. Franky teased her about it, and he replied something like \u201cCopy that, my captain\u201d with a saluting emoji. He said he was joking, Ellen thinks he was making fun of her request. I texted him right after that \u201cFranky the dress-code is important, you can\u2019t be the only one that gets kicked out, grow up and don\u2019t embarrass me\u201d.   \nLater that week, Ellen told me that she called Franky and he was awful. I had to intervene because she was in tears, so I facetimed Franky. He told me he was joking at the beginning but then Ellen said he needed to cut his hair (She told me it was \u201cjust a suggestion\u201d) and that she offered to buy him proper attire (which I think is a nice thing to do), and that\u2019s when he said \u201cfuck off, I\u2019m not touching my hair\u201d. He said Ellen told him \u201cdon\u2019t complain if you get kick out for your f\\*ggy hair then \u201d (my wife said that it's NOT true, she said \u201cugly hair\u201d which is not nice ofc but not a slur). He took all of that the wrong way and we had a fight. I might have said some hurtful things and things got heated quickly to the point where I basically told him not to come if he was making such a big deal out of it.    \nThat\u2019s it. It ain\u2019t that deep but this would be my first christmas without him. After the conflict we\u2019re not speaking. All my friends know Franky and the group chat is roasting me. They think I\u2019m a bad brother and an AH but they probably just know his version of the story. The dress-code is something out of my hands and it\u2019s NOT hard to follow.
