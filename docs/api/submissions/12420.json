He said that since his dog was the father, he had the right to claim one of them as his own.\n\nI refused to give him any of the puppies because:\n\nA.

Or at least, leaving it in until it does cause issues will ultimately be less expensive than preemptively removing it across the population.\n\nOn average, not spaying/neutering your pet will cause more issues, to the point where it will ultimately cost less to preemptively spay/neuter the pet populace.", "Correct :)", "In America the number one reason we neuter is to prevent cancer (testicular/mammary) as well as pyometra.

That may very well be the genesis of the myth - all it takes is a person going home after their vet told them to wait on a spay until their dog is old enough to have puppies, and mistranslating it into the Vet telling them to wait until their dog has HAD puppies.", "Yeah vet said because she is a medium to large dog (mongrel bred) they wouldn\u2019t go near until 2 seasons minimum.

People impulsively buy an animal to make their kids happy, or as a social statement or ornament, and next thing you know they've got puppies or kittens they can't care for and just dump them. You've also got folks who think buying a chihuahua and a toy poodle and letting them produce tons of puppies will make them rich as they sell off the \"designer breed babies\". The conditions these animals live in are usually horrifying. \n\nIn other countries where people actually TAKE CARE of their pets, and don't allow them to breed over and over in uncontrolled fashion, I'm sure the topic is more one of personal choice rather than societal or legal pressure.

And it mostly happens during hunting season when a lot of hunting dogs roam around in the forest without a leash, so I don't think wolves kill a lot of strays. \n\nThe main reason why neutering dogs is illegal here is that it's considered animal abuse (I get that a lot of people disagree that it's abuse!

It's kind of the only options unfortunately. My dog is not a pure breed and i got no kennel club to ask. \n\nThere are plenty of trainers everywhere, but most are just not any good. I've found lots of standard obedience classes for pups and adolescents, I've been to 3 of them, but none that specified in reactivity, anxiety or agression. The only one trainer i found who did, was proud to use the 'cesar Milan way' so i don't think he counts. Hell, two of the classes i went to incouraged my dog to jump up and pull on the leash. One of them incouraged leash greetings between a bunch of reactive dogs. It's just too easy to become a trainer and make a fancy website to make it look like you know what you are doing. \n\ni am talking out from experience only when I say this about the owners and trainers here. There might be a lot of good owners too, but the people in the cities i have lived in, are mostly not. Maybe there is a difference in Copenhagen because it's a big city and there isn't really room to walk a dog who has Behavioural issues, where as in the country side people just don't care that much. \n\nThanks for the link to Alix and the pack.

Because this claim is dubious.", "I'm an American so Spaying/Neutering is nearly universal where I live, but I'll chime in.\n\nThe main reason spaying and neutering is so widespread here in the US is that people by and large are bad pet owners.  People take no responsibility and and just let their pets roam, run amok and breed without control.  \n\nObviously, if they don't have the parts necessary to breed then they can't breed.\n\nHere is the more spicy take:\n\nVets talk about neutering your dog having other health and behavioral benefits.  \n\nSure spaying reduces the rate of uterus or ovary cancer in your female dog to 0%.  Because it removes those internal organs.  Removing a male dog's testicles reduces his rate of testicle cancer to 0% as well and his chance of prostate cancer by a little bit.\n\nBut do you know what the rates of those cancers are in unaltered dogs?  Very low.  They aren't big risks anyway.  \n\nThey typically also talk about removing or reducing undesirable behaviors.  Personally i find doing surgery on a dog to alter behavior abhorrent.  It's as bad in my book as the people who remove a dog's vocal cords so that it doesn't bark.\n\nEven if you don't feel that way.  Canine behavior experts all agree the affects neutering your dog has on it's behavior can vary from none at all to a lot.  \n\nFor me personally, I don't neuter my dogs.  I find it unnecessary and kind of barbaric.  I've had three male dogs in my life.  All unaltered.  None have sired puppies.  You simply need to train and supervise them.  It's not hard, but most people fail miserably at it.", "Huh, if the idea is to prevent harmful and unnecessary surgeries like docking of tail and ears that would be great.

The new vets asked if I knew how old my previous vet was... I said she probably graduated in the early to mid 90s. They said there is my answer. More studies have been done since then. It's a shame.

I got 2 other different vets' opinions, and they both said not until after the 1st heat. They said it was better for their joints, muscles, bones and growth (getting a dog fixed to early can sometimes stunt growth, which is something I never knew) and it can also lead to an increased risk in some types of cancers.
