She's become so obsessed with the planning that she gets visibly annoyed whenever I give my input on anything. It makes me really upset because this is my wedding too and I want to help plan as well.\n\nNot only that, but she refuses to acknowledge the choices I DO make. I have no idea why, but Lily seems to absolutely despise my brother. When I asked her why she said he was just \"really annoying\".\n\nShe absolutely freaked when I told her he was a groomsman. She told me I had to make him a normal guest because she would be uncomfortable with him there. She said I had to choose another person to take his place because she deserves to be happy on her wedding day as well.\n\nThis resulted in a huge fight between us, and I ended up venting to my parents about my frustrations because Lily won't listen to me about them.\n\nYesterday me and Lily went to dinner with them and the topic of the wedding came up. Well, to make a long story short, they all ended up yelling at each other over everything that's happened, and my mom ended up calling Lily a controlling b*tch. \n\nNow Lily is demanding I uninvite my parents as well, but I don't want to. Now Lily's mad at me, my parents are telling me to reconsider the relationship, and my brother thinks Lily's lost her marbles. \n\nAITA for not wanting to uninvite my parents or brother?\n\nEDIT: Hey everybody, I've been thinking over the things you've said for the past few hours, and I've come to realize this situation isn't just some drama between my fiancee and family. I'm going to talk to Lily about postponing the wedding, and if she freaks out again, I might consider cancelling it altogether.

A couple of huge red flags here:\n\n1. She sounds really focused on this dream day, regardless of what you want. Is that how she will be in the actual marriage? Be prepared to be miserable.\n2. No matter how much she plans and controls all of you to her \"perfect\"vision - something will not go perfectly that day. They never do.

You need to think the ramifications and unintended consequences of her behavior.\n\nThe wedding is the most important event of your relationship.  She seems to be so focused on making her wedding perfect, that she is pushing away everyone.  What happens after the wedding??  She wants your family uninvited from the wedding.  So, how are family events going to work after the wedding??  How are you and her supposed to show up at one of your family gatherings??  Is she planning to never go to an event with your family??  Does she think that they will just forget about her uninviting them? Or wanting them uninvited??\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is so focused on her dream wedding, that she has lost sight of the purpose of the wedding.  It\u2019s a celebration of the union of two people.  It\u2019s a transition from being single to being a couple.  It\u2019s where your parents and hers recognize that you and she are leaving your family\u2019s of origin to create a new family unit.  She is purposely antagonizing your family to get what SHE wants for the wedding.  She seems to have no insight to the damage that she is creating.\n\nYour wedding is where you make vows to your spouse to stay with them until death do you part.  Do you want to be married to someone who is so willing to just kick your family to the curb because they fit her vision?\n\nThe wedding is an hour of 1 day.  The reception is 4 hours.  After you are married, you have a lifetime of events with both families of origin, christmas, thanksgiving, birthdays, children, graduations, other weddings, and funerals to go to.  Just how are you going to be able to celebrate those things with your family after all the angst and drama from the wedding??\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is so focused on the battle (wedding), that her actions are causing her and you to lose the war (marriage).  You and she have a lifetime of events and celebrations ahead of you if you get married.  Is this the way that you want to start your life together?  It seems like having the perfect wedding is more important than the marriage or the relationships with the families.\n\nSeriously, you need to pause and think about this and then have a serious conversation with your fianc\u00e9e about what her vision is of the marriage in the context of the decisions she is trying to force on you and your family for the wedding.

This is your red flag.  Dodge this bullet.", "Run!", "NTA\n\nBut you will be if you don\u2019t hit the pause button on this wedding. This has the makings of a catastrophically bad and short marriage.

Or someone who had caused significant harm to the spouse-to-be or a close relative. That wouldn't, on its own, be cause for concern in my eyes. So I think that a blanket \"its never OK to insist that someone not be in the bridal party\" rule is a step too far.\n\nHowever, that is not at all what has happened here; OP's fianc\u00e9e simply finds his brother annoying, and that is absolutely *not* a good enough reason. Also, in this case, it's a guaranteed way to alienate the family into which she's supposed to be marrying.\n\nAt a bare minimum, OP should postpone the wedding, and use that time to decide if he wants to reschedule it or cancel it permanently. If this is a case of her going temporarily batshit, it's at least theoretically possible that postponing, and explaining why, will jolt the fianc\u00e9e enough to get the help she needs to stop and return to the non-batshit person she presumably was when OP proposed to her.", "My petty self would start vetoing her choices for bride's maids.  \"Yeah, make <x> a guest, I really don't like her.\"  Then watch her reaction...", "Oh agreed.
