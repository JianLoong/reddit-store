Something is seriously wrong  here. Your  bride-to-be sounds out of control on this and there is no way she should have forced you to change who was standing up for you. And this is YOUR day too. A couple of huge red flags here:\n\n1. She sounds really focused on this dream day, regardless of what you want. Is that how she will be in the actual marriage? Be prepared to be miserable.\n2. No matter how much she plans and controls all of you to her \"perfect\"vision - something will not go perfectly that day. They never do. I'm afraid she is going to flip out and ruin her own perfect day. It will be a miserable day for everyone unless you stop this nonsense.", "Hey OP, read slowly through your post and see all the red flags you have missed. \n\nDo you want to be isolated from your family and in a relationship where she will attempt to control every aspect of your life?  Because that is where you\u2019re headed. I don\u2019t know if there are reasons for Lilly to feel that way, however, based on your post, NTA. \n\nInstead of uninviting your parents, uninvite Lilly. That\u2019s your best option.", "NTA\n\nSorry op, but her behaviour is a major red flag. You have a chance now to dodge the bullet so pls do it. She\u2019s way too controlling and refuses to allow any input given by you. First your brother and now your parents? Time to draw the line.", "NTA - you need to step back and think about your relationship with Your fianc\u00e9e and what you want from the relationship.  You need to think the ramifications and unintended consequences of her behavior.\n\nThe wedding is the most important event of your relationship.  She seems to be so focused on making her wedding perfect, that she is pushing away everyone.  What happens after the wedding??  She wants your family uninvited from the wedding.  So, how are family events going to work after the wedding??  How are you and her supposed to show up at one of your family gatherings??  Is she planning to never go to an event with your family??  Does she think that they will just forget about her uninviting them? Or wanting them uninvited??\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is so focused on her dream wedding, that she has lost sight of the purpose of the wedding.  It\u2019s a celebration of the union of two people.  It\u2019s a transition from being single to being a couple.  It\u2019s where your parents and hers recognize that you and she are leaving your family\u2019s of origin to create a new family unit.  She is purposely antagonizing your family to get what SHE wants for the wedding.  She seems to have no insight to the damage that she is creating.\n\nYour wedding is where you make vows to your spouse to stay with them until death do you part.  Do you want to be married to someone who is so willing to just kick your family to the curb because they fit her vision?\n\nThe wedding is an hour of 1 day.  The reception is 4 hours.  After you are married, you have a lifetime of events with both families of origin, christmas, thanksgiving, birthdays, children, graduations, other weddings, and funerals to go to.  Just how are you going to be able to celebrate those things with your family after all the angst and drama from the wedding??\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is so focused on the battle (wedding), that her actions are causing her and you to lose the war (marriage).  You and she have a lifetime of events and celebrations ahead of you if you get married.  Is this the way that you want to start your life together?  It seems like having the perfect wedding is more important than the marriage or the relationships with the families.\n\nSeriously, you need to pause and think about this and then have a serious conversation with your fianc\u00e9e about what her vision is of the marriage in the context of the decisions she is trying to force on you and your family for the wedding.  She is giving you a preview of what marriage will be like with her.  Is this what you want for the next 50 years?", "NTA, but, please, do not marry this woman, she just wants a wedding, not a marriage.", "NTA because you should have family at your wedding and you should be entitled to have your brother as a groomsman. Lily's behavior is raising number of red flags.\n\nThis is supposed to be such a happy time and it is your wedding too, not just hers. It's supposed to be a partnership. You should really ask yourself, \"Is this how I want the rest of my life to be like?\"\n\nIf the answer is yes, take the plunge. If the answer is no, break it off.", "NTA\n\nYou really need to rethink marrying this person. It would be either a lifetime of browbeating or a clear instance of ignoring all the red flags before you married your first wife.", "NTA.\n\nThis is your wedding, too. Your fianc\u00e9e can't dictate your groomsmen any more than you can dictate her bridesmaids. Especially when it comes to your brother.\n\nYour parents are right: reconsider the relationship (or at least your engagement).", "NTA, but this is something that needs to be addressed on a broader level. If we take your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s comment  that your brother is just \u201creally annoying,\u201d her insistence here is utterly unreasonable and I understand your brother\u2019s perception. \n\nNow\u2026 is there another side to this? Nobody can know that except you and the people in this post. \n\nBut her behaviour here should not be minimized. You are creating a ceremony that is supposed to begin a partnership, and you are a partner, not a subordinate. If she cannot see that her behaviour is problematic, you have a bigger problem than a wedding. You have relationship trouble.", "NTA, but slow your roll and think for a minute.  It doesn't sound like your family is wrong here.  She gets annoyed when you have input for YOUR OWN wedding.  She doesn't want your brother to be a groomsman because he's annoying?  I suspect it's because he stands up to her.  \n\nHow much does she listen to your wishes normally?  Is this just a slightly worse version of her normal self?  How often does she insist that her wishes are more important?", "NTA. First impression - you parents description of your fiance is spot on. You may want to take a close look if the wedding is a great idea", "NTA.\n\nThe person you should uninvite from the wedding is Lily.\n\nYour family is correct in that you should re-evaluate this relationship and do you want to deal with this type of behavior from her on an ongoing basis?  \n\nLily has shown you who she is.  Believe her.", "NTA. Your fiancee is a raging bridezilla AH though.", "NTA but slow down the wedding planning. Many red flags are flapping. Why is she and your family getting along poorly? Why is she not open to your input on the planning? These are things to figure out before even consider further wedding plans.", "NTA. Dude, save yourself the trouble and money and let this girl go.", "NTA. You need to SERIOUSLY rethink this wedding. Your fiancee's attitude about the whole thing is horrible, and I wouldn't want to get hitched to someone who treated ANYONE the way she is treating you and your family. I'd have to have a serious conversation about it all, because this person is showing a REALLY ugly side.\n\nBeing single is better than being married to a dictator. Yes, this is about the wedding, but this level of entitlement and control doesn't materialize out of thin air. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA your family is right about her", "NTA\n\nYou ought to consider uninviting yourself from the wedding. Her behavior has red flags all over.", "INFO: what kind of suggestions did you make for the wedding? Are we talking cake flavor or \"naked dancing Hulagirls as showact\"?\nWho is paying for the wedding? Both, Lily/parents or you/parents?\n\nI am tending to NTA\nIt IS also your wedding and you should choose whoever you want as YOUR groomsman. I bet Lily wouldn't be happy if you don't want her bestie as her bridesmaid.\nCurrently it sounds more like \"Lily wants HER dreamwedding and doesn't care who she marries\" maybe you really need to rethink your relationship.", "NTA: Your mom shouldn't have said that, but Lily's focusing way too much on the wedding, not enough on the marriage. I strongly recommend that the two of you press pause on the wedding for a year or two at least, time enough to get some counseling, do some talking, and figure out how to balance both your needs and get her thinking about this as something besides Lily's Big Party. If she has actual substantive issues with your brother, she needs to be able to voice that; if not, she needs to accept that he'll always be an important part of your life. Rushing to the altar without resolving this may lead to a whole lot of trouble later.", "NTA and you may want to put a pause on planning the wedding.  If she finds your brother annoying now, will anything change after the wedding?", "Absolutly NTA. Lily sounds like she is, what your mother called her. Is this usuall for her? If so, you might really reconsider the relationship. If not. Maybe tell her, to put the wedding on hold. It is not only her big day but also yours, and you have to work together. If she is not willing to do so - no wedding.", "NTA\n\nNope. Shut it down. This is a glimpse of every important decision the two of you would make as a married couple.\n\nMy family has an old saying-\n\nSay anything while snapping your samsonites shut.", "NTA\n\nBut I think you would be (only to yourself) if you stay in this relationship.\n\nIt is blatantly obvious that Lily believes your wedding day is all about her, and you are just a prop. And I guarantee she cares more about your wedding than your marriage.\n\nThey are your parents, he is your brother, and this is YOUR WEDDING too. \n\nI think maybe you should step back and reevaluate, because your mom was NOT wrong. \n\nLily is controlling, entitled, selfish and honestly childish.\n\nBest of luck!", "NTA.
