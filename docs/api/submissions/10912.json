Something is seriously wrong  here. Your  bride-to-be sounds out of control on this and there is no way she should have forced you to change who was standing up for you. And this is YOUR day too. A couple of huge red flags here:\n\n1. She sounds really focused on this dream day, regardless of what you want. Is that how she will be in the actual marriage? Be prepared to be miserable.\n2. No matter how much she plans and controls all of you to her \"perfect\"vision - something will not go perfectly that day. They never do. I'm afraid she is going to flip out and ruin her own perfect day. It will be a miserable day for everyone unless you stop this nonsense.", "Hey OP, read slowly through your post and see all the red flags you have missed. \n\nDo you want to be isolated from your family and in a relationship where she will attempt to control every aspect of your life?

You need to think the ramifications and unintended consequences of her behavior.\n\nThe wedding is the most important event of your relationship.  She seems to be so focused on making her wedding perfect, that she is pushing away everyone.  What happens after the wedding??  She wants your family uninvited from the wedding.  So, how are family events going to work after the wedding??  How are you and her supposed to show up at one of your family gatherings??  Is she planning to never go to an event with your family??  Does she think that they will just forget about her uninviting them? Or wanting them uninvited??\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is so focused on her dream wedding, that she has lost sight of the purpose of the wedding.  It\u2019s a celebration of the union of two people.  It\u2019s a transition from being single to being a couple.  It\u2019s where your parents and hers recognize that you and she are leaving your family\u2019s of origin to create a new family unit.  She is purposely antagonizing your family to get what SHE wants for the wedding.  She seems to have no insight to the damage that she is creating.\n\nYour wedding is where you make vows to your spouse to stay with them until death do you part.  Do you want to be married to someone who is so willing to just kick your family to the curb because they fit her vision?\n\nThe wedding is an hour of 1 day.  The reception is 4 hours.  After you are married, you have a lifetime of events with both families of origin, christmas, thanksgiving, birthdays, children, graduations, other weddings, and funerals to go to.  Just how are you going to be able to celebrate those things with your family after all the angst and drama from the wedding??\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is so focused on the battle (wedding), that her actions are causing her and you to lose the war (marriage).  You and she have a lifetime of events and celebrations ahead of you if you get married.  Is this the way that you want to start your life together?  It seems like having the perfect wedding is more important than the marriage or the relationships with the families.\n\nSeriously, you need to pause and think about this and then have a serious conversation with your fianc\u00e9e about what her vision is of the marriage in the context of the decisions she is trying to force on you and your family for the wedding.  She is giving you a preview of what marriage will be like with her.

Nobody can know that except you and the people in this post. \n\nBut her behaviour here should not be minimized.

I'd have to have a serious conversation about it all, because this person is showing a REALLY ugly side.\n\nBeing single is better than being married to a dictator.

I strongly recommend that the two of you press pause on the wedding for a year or two at least, time enough to get some counseling, do some talking, and figure out how to balance both your needs and get her thinking about this as something besides Lily's Big Party.

Your fianc\u00e9e is out of control. People get so caught up in having the \u201cperfect\u201d wedding they forget that it\u2019s a celebration of the union of TWO people.  Lily has disrespected you & your family. I agree that you should just disinvite her. Good luck.", "Info: did Lily used to date your brother or did he say/do something creepy? Because that might explain some of her issues, but if she's not taking any of your input for the wedding you have way bigger problems. I do not envy your upcoming dramatic conversations.", "Run! NTA but don\u2019t marry this girl.", "NTA. Run for your life", "NTA \n\nI would be reconsidering the fianc\u00e9e. She forgets that a wedding is *1 day* while marriage is for life. What kind of life does she think you'd have when her relationship to your parents and brother is permanently damaged?\n\nAt the very least, put a stop to any planning and get couples counseling. \n\nI am married, roughly a decade, and I asked my husband for his input on things and didn't worry myself with who he had for groomsmen because it wasn't my say, IMO.", "Run.  This is your red flag.  Dodge this bullet.", "Run!", "NTA\n\nBut you will be if you don\u2019t hit the pause button on this wedding. This has the makings of a catastrophically bad and short marriage. You two have a bunch of pre-wedding fundamentals to figure out still. You could still live happily ever after but this work needs to happen without the burden of marriage.", "NTA.  Here\u2019s a suggestion: uninvite yourself!", "NTA. Why are you marrying this?", "ESH. You all sound like horrible people.", "ESH\n\nTake time to invest in some marriage counseling, before you need to invest in a divorce.\n\nA wedding should be both of you choosing it.  And you absolutely should get to pick your groomsmen(unless they are somehow abusive or otherwise unacceptable--annoying really isn't a good reason).", "This part.\n\nSound like Lily wants a wedding, not a marriage.\n\nNTA", "Best comment.\nYeah, your family is right. She\u2019s controlling. NTA.", "You made me lol with this comment! Spot on - Lily is the one who should not be at the wedding.", "Love this idea!!!! NTA but lily is", "I would agree with insisting that, say, someone who had previously abused or bullied one's prospective spouse should not be a groomsman or bridesmaid. Or someone who had caused significant harm to the spouse-to-be or a close relative. That wouldn't, on its own, be cause for concern in my eyes. So I think that a blanket \"its never OK to insist that someone not be in the bridal party\" rule is a step too far.\n\nHowever, that is not at all what has happened here; OP's fianc\u00e9e simply finds his brother annoying, and that is absolutely *not* a good enough reason. Also, in this case, it's a guaranteed way to alienate the family into which she's supposed to be marrying.\n\nAt a bare minimum, OP should postpone the wedding, and use that time to decide if he wants to reschedule it or cancel it permanently. If this is a case of her going temporarily batshit, it's at least theoretically possible that postponing, and explaining why, will jolt the fianc\u00e9e enough to get the help she needs to stop and return to the non-batshit person she presumably was when OP proposed to her.", "My petty self would start vetoing her choices for bride's maids.  \"Yeah, make <x> a guest, I really don't like her.\"  Then watch her reaction...", "Oh agreed. I really meant just banning someone because you don't like the or find them annoying or they don't fit with your picture of the \"perfect\" wedding. Good clarification", "Agreed. But either way it sounds like the wedding should not go ahead."]}
