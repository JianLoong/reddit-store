Right now my room mate is having a discussion with her boyfriend in the kitchen area (They have both been crying). I only know that because I lugged my laundry down 2 flights of stairs to only discover that. I asked if I could put my laundry in and they were like sure. I needed to do laundry I have basically no clean clothes left.\n\nWell my laundry is now done. It technically has been for 20ish minutes. Within the next 2 hours I would like to go to sleep and drying takes exactly an hour. \n\nWIBTA if I went down there to switch over my laundry to the dryer knowing my room mate has not come back the room and might still be having a conversation with her boyfriend?\n\nEdit: Okay I realize how much I was overthinking things but its my first time having a room mate and I really don't to make them resent me or anything. I'm just going to throw headphones in and just do it as fast as possible.", "created_utc": 1667186791, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhzgw1/wibta_if_i_went_to_go_change_my_laundry_over/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They must know people could come in and out", "NTA.  Public spaces are public, they can go somewhere else.", "No lol wtf go change your laundry and get ready for bed, you have my permission", "NTA. Go switch your clothes!", "They are in a common area so no YWNBTA, if they want a private conversation they shouldn't be in the common area", "Lmao NTA get ur clothes & go on", "NTA. You aren\u2019t going through a bedroom or private space, if they don\u2019t choose to have their discussion in a private location it\u2019s not your responsibility to rearrange things around them.", "You WNBTA. \n\nThe world doesn't revolve around them.", "NTA. She should be having her little spat in the bedroom not the kitchen. I wouldn't even give them a heads-up since she wants to do this in the kitchen.", "NTA. Give them warning, and then do it.", "NTA. Knock, or announce your presence, then go in.\n\nCommunal areas need to be communal accessible. Is there somewhere else where they could have a serious taaalk in private?", "No you wouldn't be an AH. If it is a fully private conversation she shouldn't be having it in a common area. Just go down, knock say excuse me so they know you're coming in, put your washing on to dry and then go back up to your room. There is no reason to linger so should take a few minutes to do and the same once dry. If she was to say anything then you just point out the common areas aren't the best place for discussion and would be better in her room and leave it at that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
