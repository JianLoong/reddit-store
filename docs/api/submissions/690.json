My bf is an extrovert who happens to hate most people. \n\nWe have had clashes in the past because he feels the need to talk through, and debrief on, everything that is on his mind regardless of the time of day or what else i happen to be doing at the time. I process things in my head and get energy from being left tf alone with my thoughts.\n\nFor the past 3 weeks, my bf has enthusiastically been looking into properties and mortgages and making purchasing plans on our behalf. This week i have had some very high profile, high pressure deadlines at work, with a particular piece of work being demanded by the Board and CEO of my company. \n\nFor the past few days have asked and told my bf in many, varied ways to pause talk of property with me as i do not have the headspace for it and am getting overwhelmed and stressed with the amount of things i have to pay attention to. I said once i get this major piece of work done, he can carry on debriefing his mental load. 3-4 times yesterday and today, he agreed with my request only to exhaustively list everything on his mind within 30 mins of each conversation.\n\nHe did it again tonight, an hour after i explicitly said i can not pay attention to it this week, and to please give me a time out, and i kind of lost my shit at him. I snapped that he doesn\u2019t listen to me, i have asked him repeatedly to give him a break, and he has no right to get shitty with me for having boundaries (he was visibly annoyed). He said he WAS listening and justified him talking at length about his stuff as he didn\u2019t expect me to DO anything, and that me telling him he was annoyed is the thing that made him annoyed and can I PLEASE just watch tv and get over it. At that point, i half shouted NO and left the room and uneaten dinner and have been in a separate room since, both of us seething at the injustice of the other.\n\nSo, AITA for snapping at him?", "created_utc": 1667304471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj6zjm/aita_for_snapping_at_my_bf_42m/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wants you to accommodate hoods personality & needs but refuses to to the same for you. He's being self absorbed & insensitive.", "NTA\n\nHe's ignoring your reasonable ask because *he* has decided it's not important, because he personally doesn't relate to needing it. \n\nYou've been clear that you do need it, and it's not unfair to ask for. He's steamrolling through those boundaries and then denying you have any right to them. You snapped because nothing else was getting him to respect the boundary.\n\nExhausting and uncool.", "NTA. You have expressed yourself several times and he didnt listen. It wasnt nice that you snapped at him, but I understand why you did it since it seemed like the only thing that will make him listen", "ESH. Have you considered using noise cancelling headphones? Being in separate spaces? Communicating in more effective ways? Using something to signal that you need to be left alone?", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t an introvert/extrovert issue, per se.  This is an issue with your BF thinking that his needs are the only ones that matter, and that you need to accomodate his wants right now.  Despite your telling him clearly and repeatedly that now is not a good time.  The need being expressed could be anything, and I doubt this is the only area of your relationship where he would ignore your direct statements that his actions are a problem.  I would seriously be reconsidering this relationship if I was you.  He seems to be very self-centered and to have no respect for your needs and boundaries.", "NTA. You clearly laid out your boundaries many times, and he didn't respect them or empathise with your situation. Him not asking you to \"do anything\" is irrelevant here, since your boundary was to gain space from any _talk_ about property for a while. It's normal to lose control when you're not being heard or respected, and your bf is TA here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA, I get why you yelled. But it is important that you do have a conversation about this if you want to stay in this relationship. You cannot have a healthy relationship with someone who ignores your boundaries. And there will be more times when your boyfriend has to leave you alone because you can't handle it.", "Soft YTA, your BF takes comfort in discussing things on his mind, and you don't.  But to get angry with him for something that is his nature is akin to blaming a lion for eating an antelope. You don't say how long you are together, but if you can't accept him and his way, then your relationship is doomed.", "She told him and asked him multiple times to wait on the conversation before she would be able to participate in it again and he agreed every time. He\u2019s the only AH here, even if she snapped at him. AND his response is telling because he tried to put it all on her instead of accepting responsibility that he ignored her asking him to stop the conversations for a bit.", "i think previously asking him explicitly not to download about properties counts as quite a clear signal not to download about properties.", "Why doesn't the same apply to him accepting her and her way?\n\nShould the antelope be happy that it gets bitten by the lion, or is it the antelope's nature to try to stop the lion from biting it?", "The way I see it is that \"losing her shit\" at him over a known part of his personality without taking all other steps to have her needs met and for him to understand the effect his behavior is having on her is enough to expand this to ESH.", "But she has taken steps, is the point.", "No, the point is that the steps weren't effective until she lost her shit. I'm not saying he's NTA for not listening, I'm merely saying that the poor communication is a shared failure."]}
