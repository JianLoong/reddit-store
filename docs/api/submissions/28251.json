{"id": 28251, "submission_id": "1709k2n", "title": "AITA for exposing my friend's cheating husband?", "selftext": "Around a week ago, a group of my coworkers and I were having casual lunch and talking about each other's lives when this girl (who joined not too long ago) who we'll call Jane (34F), told us about a guy who she's been dating for a while and how she thinks they will be making it official soon. She was excitedly going on about him when another coworker asked her for a picture of him, if she has any. Initially she was hesitant because, her words, \"he doesn't like having his pictures taken\". \n\nSo she pulls up a picture of him and the moment my eyes land on her phone, I became fucking paralyzed for a few moments. Yeah, it was none other than Mark (42M), who happens to be the husband of my friend Sarah (39F). I couldn't believe my eyes, and I was so freaking confused about all of this. After asking her around a bit, I found out that Mark and Jane have been seeing each other for almost a year now and also used to be high school sweethearts who just \\*happened to reconnect\\*. \n\nSo after lunch that day, I impulsively decided to confront Mark, we spoke over the phone and I told him everything about Jane, and he admitted to seeing Jane behind Sarah's back. Mark claimed it was a recent fling and promised to end things with Jane and work on his marriage with Sarah. He begged me profusely to not tell Sarah anything, as he'll fix this up himself. Reluctantly, I agreed to keep this whole thing between us, thinking he might end things with Jane or maybe tell Sarah of his infidelity himself. \n\nUnfortunately, I soon discovered that Mark hadn't kept his word. He was still seeing Jane, betraying them both. Also, Jane doesn't know Mark's married, as he never told her. So at this point, both of the women are unaware of Mark two timing them.\n\nFeeling stuck in the middle and because Mark went back on his promise, I decided Sarah deserved to know the truth. I spilled the beans about the affair and Mark's ongoing involvement with Jane. Sarah was devastated, and she confronted Mark, leading to a heated fight, police were called etc and that pretty much ended with her asking for a divorce. \n\nNow, things have taken a dramatic turn in our friend group. Some of our mutual friends are angry with me, blaming me for causing the collapse of a seemingly good marriage. Hostility is all times high against me within our friend group, and it's putting a strain on our relationships.\n\nTo make matters worse, Mark's mother even contacted me, expressing her anger and frustration, and she wasn't shy about using choice words to describe my actions. She called me a bitch and a homewrecker like I was the one Mark was cheating with??????\n\nSo, tl;dr, am I the asshole for exposing my friend's cheating husband to her and the girl he was cheating on with and potentially causing a divorce in their marriage and bad blood among our friend group? Should I have just stayed out of it all together, or did I do the right thing by revealing the full extent of Mark's betrayal?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1696483073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1709k2n/aita_for_exposing_my_friends_cheating_husband/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of chastising her son for cheating she's blaming you. Anyone in your friend group who thinks you did the wrong thing are people you don't want to be around. They're not likely trustworthy people themselves.   \nIt's idiotic for them to think you broke up the marriage.", "NTA - you have bad friends if they are mad at you for his actions. You would be an atrocious friend for not saying something. Honestly this shows your friends morals and values, do you want to be friends with people who think it\u2019s fine to cheat like that?", "INFO - How are Jane and Mark high school sweethearts if she is 34 and he is 42?", "NTA. You didn't cause the collapse, **he** did. You even gave him the chance to save his marriage, and he chose to not take it.", "NTA !!!\nits not a good marriage if he cant keep it in his pants himself let alone needing someone to tell him to stop and him doing it anyway, drop your friends that are mad at you, they can get cheated on and know that they left a friend who would have told them", "NTA. Your friend group sucks too. Absolutely sounds like the kind of people who prefer false civility over real relationships and connections.\n\n1. You gave the husband a chance to make amends himself, which is more than most would've done but he lied to you and never stopped seeing Jane\n2. You told his wife, as you should. He disrespected your friend, he disrespected his mistress but making her a mistress without her knowledge, and he disrespected you by making you part of his web of lies when he promised he'd fix it himself and didn't.\n3. Your friends are insane. Anyone that prefers fake peace and civility over having a conversation when things are going bad are the worst of the lot. They would (and according to your story, actually are) blame someone for bringing something up instead of blaming the person who actually did the thing.\n4. His mum sounds like the kind of mother that coddles her son and believes he can do no wrong. Anyone who tells her otherwise will be met with gaslighting of the highest order. Where does she get off calling you a homewrecker when her son, yknow... wrecked his home with his infidelity?\n\n100% NTA", "NTA \n\nYou didn't cause the collapse of a seemingly good marriage. He ruined a seemingly good marriage by cheating.", "You ruined his marriage! It was all your fault, all HE did was be the one who cheated on his wife and lied to his girlfriend. It was all you!\n\nJesus God. NTA. Your friends suck.", "I mean, this is gaslighting ultra pro max.\n\nGuy cheats, you show the mirror and people think you're the villian. UGH. People are so stupid at times.\n\nYou're NTA and if your friend Sarah thinks otherwise, you need new friends. If a friend cannot see that you were looking out for her, what's the point of having friends in the first place smh.\n\nScrew Mark and screw his mother!", "Girl all I can say is \u201cYou my kinda peep a true ride or die!\u201d You just need better friends than the group you with now!", "Your a brilliant friend I had to do this once and I don't regret if for a second they were both my friends I bumped into a old friend at a local DIY store she excitedly told me about a new man is treating her for her birthday and he seems to go to be true she showed me a picture and I told her this is my friends live on partner of five years. She thanked me and I rang my other friend put her on the phone and they talked both of them confronted him turns out there was more than her he had multiple women all of them left him. He begged my friend for a second chance how she can't throw away five years she said you should have thought of that before you even messaged another women. He now sulks around our friend group telling everyone I ruined his life he need to take accountability for his own actions just like your friends husband he is the cheat", "NTA!!! the world need more friends like you", "NTA.  You could have been a better friend by telling Sarah in the first place and letting Jane know that he was married to your friend, and she's also being played.  \n\nBut you still are not an AH because, in the end, you supported your friend.\n\nIgnore the flees texting you.", "Nta.

If anything they should be crucifying Mark not you.", "Info: How were Mark and Jane high school sweethearts with an 8 year age gap? This does not add up. \n\nOn the rest of the story: I don't feel like you did anything wrong. You told Mark and gave him a chance to come clean. He didn't. I would not want to see my friend in a marriage where she is being betrayed on a daily basis. \n\nAlso, not matter what the other people say, HE caused the collapse of his marriage, not you. Do not let anyone gaslight you into believing otherwise. \n\nUnfortunately this is one of those situation where you can't do anything right. Initially you always seem like the bad guy....damend if you do, damned if you don't. Either you are the cause of the blow out fight by saying something or if you don't say anything you are the cause she stayed in a doomed marriage for longer than would have needed to.", " Fuck all of them don\u2019t ever not believe in what you just did because the truth is you did every prayer favor so they can go fuck themselves", "It honestly shocks me that this same question shows up so often--that's not judgment/disapproval towards you, OP, I just can't understand why so many people's friends think they should have kept quiet after discovering someone *betrayed their intimate partner's trust.* NTA!", "High school sweetheart with 8 years difference?
