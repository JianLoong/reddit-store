On Friday they told us that the CEO will be distributing education courses to a few employees who he thinks are assets to the company. Basically, if they think you\u2019re an asset, they pay for you to do courses so you can advance in the company. The email suggested that interested employees send HR a pitch on why they should be chosen.\n\nWell, I created my pitch and was selected along with 3 other people to join a business dinner with the CEO, my supervisor and HR to speak with them in person. I was super excited and told my boyfriend (26) about it. He was really happy for me. I explained that it was a dinner and spent 3 days preparing for it like if it was an interview.\n\nThe dinner was in a restaurant owned by someone close to the CEO. I get there 30 minutes early (at my supervisor\u2019s insistence) and only the CEO and my supervisor is at the table. I sit down and after chatting for a few, my supervisor excuses herself to the washroom.\n\nThe waitress comes up to take our orders. I look up and realize it\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s friend, Aria (25). She gives me the side eye and asks what we\u2019re having. The CEO says that we\u2019re expecting a few people and asks if she can come back in a few minutes. She smiled and walked away. \n\nAfter about 5 minutes minutes, my supervisor comes back and we continue the conversation. \n\nAbout 15 minutes after I get a call from my boyfriend. I see the call but I didn\u2019t answer because the CEO was speaking and I didn\u2019t want to cut him off to answer a call. I planned to just send my boyfriend a text after.\n\nThen I heard \u201cso this is what we\u2019re doing?\u201d I turn around and my boyfriend is there with the waitress friend. I\u2019m too stunned to speak. He starts yelling at me for having an \u201cintimate\u201d dinner with the boss and accused me IN FRONT OF EVERYONE of \u201csleeping around\u201d for a \u201chigher position\u201d while his friend is just smiling. \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to do so I started crying. At this point the other employees who were chosen arrives and the manager came out and told us we are making a scene. She then asked me to leave. I tried to explain but everyone agreed. The CEO thanked me for coming but said he doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll be a good fit for the positions they want to fill in the future. \n\nI just ran out of the restaurant and went home. I didn\u2019t answer messages or calls. But I sat there crying and went to delete my pitch when I saw it. My boyfriend is in Law school and I saw an assignment I helped him with. It took us a few weeks to complete with our schedules and I knew it\u2019s due this week so I just deleted it and sent him a recording of it being deleted from recycle bin. \n\nThat assignment is worth a lot of his grade so he flipped out on me and said I\u2019m a huge AH for jeopardizing his education over a mistake he made. \n\nNow I had some time to think about it and I don\u2019t know if I acted wrongly.

He was an idiot and lost his shit, and perhaps could have tried to fix it on the scene and didn't, and she should break up with him, full stop.  But I still don't think she's even a little better than he is, because he was reacting unfairly and irrationally to misinterpreting the situation (perhaps not helped by having been misled) and acted an ass hole in response to thinking she was cheating - poor judgment, being an ass hole, yes, all of those things, but he was clearly not calculating.
