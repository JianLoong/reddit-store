She said that her dog probably got a hold of it and it wasn't her fault if the book was destroyed because of her dog. I told her to return the book she didn't lose, and the next day she gave it back to me, but the book had a curve to it and half of the corners were dog-eared. \n\nI told her she now owed me $30 as she had lost one of the books and ruined the other one. She called me insensible and that they were only books, that I could buy them myself since they were only $30 in total.\n\nI told her I wasn't going to talk to her until she gave me the $30, and I genuinely haven't spoken to her since.\n\nA few of our shared friends have called me immature for asking for money and losing a friend because of books.

Weather they were chewed by the dog, stolen by a sibling, had water spilled on them, or other damages, it was her responsibility to keep those things from happening to your books.

She is 100% TA. If I ruined or lost something I borrowed from a friend I would be absolutely beside myself trying to make it up to them.

You loaned her your treasured books in good faith and she disrespected you and breached your trust by not taking care of them.\n\nI had a friend do something similar to me once - she desperately wanted to read a book I owned, which I happily loaned her on the proviso I got it back in the same condition I loaned it to her in. She read it but then accidentally left it out in a rainstorm and it got ruined. The difference was my friend felt bad for what happened to my book and she replaced it.\n\nIf you\u2019ve lost her as a friend, she want worth having as she clearly doesn\u2019t respect you, your belongings or what is important to you.
