This is the second week he and his worker have been here, and they\u2019re doing a great job. He\u2019s honest, hard working, and meticulous. \n\n\nThe problem is that last week, he had an emergency where his wife had to go into work on two days she wasn\u2019t scheduled for, so he unexpectedly showed up with his 5 year old daughter. The girl is very nice and polite, but there was no heads up or warning this was happening. I have a 4 year old daughter and I stay home with her, so it wasn\u2019t a huge hardship to watch both for 2 days (about 9am to 5pm). The dad provided lunch and drinks for his child. \n\n\nHowever, he brought her over again yesterday while he was working, but I had a doctor\u2019s appointment I needed to go to and was going to drop my daughter off with my mother for it. So now the 5 year old would essentially be unsupervised in my house while her dad is working on the bathroom on a different floor of the house from where she\u2019s playing. I told her dad that I needed to leave in case he assumed I could watch all day again, and he said it was fine and she could occupy herself in the living room while he worked with his assistant. So I ended up going to my appointment and taking my son to my mother\u2019s (as had been planned). But the whole thing felt extremely uncomfortable and imposing. \n\n\nMy question is, WIBTA if I text my contractor and tell him that while his daughter is lovely, I\u2019m not interested in continuing to provide daycare for her or having her alone in my house (essentially unsupervised) since he\u2019s busy working and not able to watch her fully. I would just say that if doesn\u2019t have childcare that day, to please not come and I won\u2019t hold it against him.

You are NOT responsible for providing your contractor with free child care.  Would you take your son to work and expect your boss to watch him while you worked?", "Children don't belong on a work site. \n\nYup, it sucks for the contractor. \n\nOP's child is fine because she can supervise her own child.\n\nThe contractor cannot supervise his child and is getting free daycare. \n\nIt doesn't matter how well behaved the child is. Kids get bored and will wander or want their parent's attention - which could cause him to lose focus and cause an accident. \n\nWhile the contractor is working, his child could step on a nail, touch equipment or building material and cause an accident. \n\nIt's not worth the possibility of injuring a child or himself. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Just tell him straight away. That you are not comfortable with it. There is nothing personal. That you don't want to take liability for a kid if something goes south.", "NTA or no-assholes.  You are well within your rights to tell him you are not comfortable because of safety, liability, or privacy concerns.  Since the contractor hasn't done anything wrong yet, can't judge him as an ass either.\n\nDo speak with him as soon as possible though to set expectations and requirements.", "NTA... I had a contractor who did something similar once. The guy was nice but his kid was running around our property while he worked and his wife was just sitting in the car.\n\nI politely told him that as a home owner I don't want the responsibility of liability Incase she gets hurt. I could also tell that he was working faster then needed and compromising on some quality things.. \n\nAt bare minimum I'd probably ask your contractor to at least ask ahead of time.", "I consider bringing his daughter unprofessional and imposing (this isn't a sterile worksite...it's someone's private home), yet I also recognize that it shows how dedicated he is to completing his work so I don't think anybody is an AH and I am sympathetic for emergency childcare issues.  I wouldn't like the child in my house either--whether I'm there or not--so OP is not an AH.  Hopefully, this won't repeat itself since the emergency was for two days.  I'd say he was probably already embarrassed at having to bring her in the first place and no doubt picked up on OP's tone at saying she couldn't watch her.  If it ends after these two days, no harm done. It if happens again, it'll be time to have the talk and OP WNBTA.", "NAH My dad is a contractor and he\u2019d sometimes bring my brother and I during similar emergencies. We were well behaved kids and didn\u2019t cause trouble, but I definitely can see how it would make a homeowner nervous. You don\u2019t know the kid and accidents happen all the time. Just ask him for a heads up or ask him to find other arrangements.", "I'm in a hard spot with this one, because I've been that 5 year old.\n\nBut I will mention that to this day my elders still reminisce that I was a particularly easy child, arguably because I grew up a home that was my grandparents and that I was taught that kids are to be seen and not heard.\n\nEither way, I would say you're in your rights, but also that I don't see this being particularly unlikely in a small business/small town. Also offering for your project to be put on hold until his schedule resumes to normal may be a good way to approach it.\n\nNAH I think.", "NAH. This is a safety issue more than anything else. If she gets hurt, it's on your homeowner's policy. Even if you say you won't hold it against him, there's likely a clause for a completion date in the contract with penalty.\n\nIf you'd be open to being paid for childcare through a discount, that's a different conversation.", "NTA, but holy moly work on your phrasing. \"I'm not interested in continuing to provide daycare for her\" is such a bad way to phrase that. Just be clear that you don't feel comfortable with an unsupervised child in your house. Be ready to offer some type of solution though, like if they tell you they need to delay a few days or something. Otherwise, pay them for the services already rendered and say that you would be willing to hire them for future jobs and recommend their services to their friends / family.", "NTA", "NTA. I understand that families have emergencies, but it was unprofessional of him to bring her to the job site and then to expect the client to babysit. Especially so, when your schedule meant you had to leave and she was unsupervised, not only in someone else\u2019s home, but at a construction site. \n\nIs the contractor going to provide you with a discount on their work because you are being required to provide babysitting services?", "NTA my mom would bring me to job sites (she is an interior designer) when I was young. But the rules were EXTREMELY clear. I stayed glued to her side, helped her carry in whatever, and stayed quiet. She would never in a million years expect someone to watch me or leave me alone in someone else\u2019s living room while she worked. If that didn\u2019t work for whatever reason, I would stay in the car and read a book.", "Nta.  It is understandable the first day if he had no other option.  But at this point, he is using you for free daycare.  Helping him out in a pinch was a nice thing to do but he or his wife should have made other arrangements after the first day.  You are paying him for a service and watching his kid for free.  he\u2019s taking advantage of you.", "NTA. Its a HUGE liability for you if the child gets hurt in anyway, especially if they are unsupervised. This is business, not personal. You have to tell him not to bring the child anymore.", "YWNBTA", "NTA. He should've asked the first time. It's fair that he had an emergency, but he should've asked. Definitely he should ask these additional times. You might be liable if something were to happen to his kid.", "YWNBTA. One time is one thing, but this is not how you juggle work and child care. There are a lot of things that can go wrong with a 5 year old unsupervised in your house, you should absolutely talk to him.", "NTA\n\nMy husband has never brought our kid to jobsite while he planned to work. That's a huge liability to a customer. It sucks but we find ways to make it happen.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, by the time he was 10, he spent summers & time after school working & learning his trade from his dad but that was in the 70s-80s.", "NTA.  Five-year-olds need close supervision.  I can feel for any working parent struggling with childcare; been there myself.  That said, it's totally unreasonable for him to assume you will provide this service while he works on your home.  I'd suggest you ask that in the future, if he needs to bring his daughter with him, that he check with you to make sure you are available to watch her (assuming you don't mind doing so) and, if you aren't, that he not work in your home that day as you are not comfortable having her unsupervised in your home.  For him to just show up with her is way too presumptuous and he needs to realize this.", "NTA You are not obligated to watch his kid.  Do not feel the least bit guilty", "YTA, this was normal for me growing up. He can leave the kid home alone, or bring her there. If you didn\u2019t have a kid I\u2019d reconsider my vote, but YTA", "Can your mom come to yours to watch both the kiddos?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He also laughed about the rickety scaffolding he was going to put up and went on and on about how he wants to score big and retire to the islands. He was actually surprised when I told him he didn\u2019t get the job. Really surprised. What a bonehead.", "That's exactly it--it's unprofessional and a liability. I'm kind of shocked he'd ever consider doing this--no one should be more aware than him what an incredible amount of headache a kid at a work site can cause. It sets me on fire a little that he thought he could ask OP to monitor his child in any way. \n\nThis is a hard no way for me. OP is paying this person to fix her house. He should have backup plans for childcare emergencies, especially in his line of work, and for no reason should he bring his kid to a strange home. If this was someone I hired I'd seriously consider giving them a warning that childcare was never part of the contract. This is so weird!", "Yes! He's taking advantage under the guise that he can't work without the kid being along. Just wrong."]}
