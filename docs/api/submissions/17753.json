He\u2019s honest, hard working, and meticulous. \n\n\nThe problem is that last week, he had an emergency where his wife had to go into work on two days she wasn\u2019t scheduled for, so he unexpectedly showed up with his 5 year old daughter. The girl is very nice and polite, but there was no heads up or warning this was happening. I have a 4 year old daughter and I stay home with her, so it wasn\u2019t a huge hardship to watch both for 2 days (about 9am to 5pm). The dad provided lunch and drinks for his child. \n\n\nHowever, he brought her over again yesterday while he was working, but I had a doctor\u2019s appointment I needed to go to and was going to drop my daughter off with my mother for it. So now the 5 year old would essentially be unsupervised in my house while her dad is working on the bathroom on a different floor of the house from where she\u2019s playing. I told her dad that I needed to leave in case he assumed I could watch all day again, and he said it was fine and she could occupy herself in the living room while he worked with his assistant. So I ended up going to my appointment and taking my son to my mother\u2019s (as had been planned). But the whole thing felt extremely uncomfortable and imposing. \n\n\nMy question is, WIBTA if I text my contractor and tell him that while his daughter is lovely, I\u2019m not interested in continuing to provide daycare for her or having her alone in my house (essentially unsupervised) since he\u2019s busy working and not able to watch her fully.

I had a contractor who did something similar once.

I wouldn't like the child in my house either--whether I'm there or not--so OP is not an AH.  Hopefully, this won't repeat itself since the emergency was for two days.  I'd say he was probably already embarrassed at having to bring her in the first place and no doubt picked up on OP's tone at saying she couldn't watch her.

Just ask him for a heads up or ask him to find other arrangements.", "I'm in a hard spot with this one, because I've been that 5 year old.\n\nBut I will mention that to this day my elders still reminisce that I was a particularly easy child, arguably because I grew up a home that was my grandparents and that I was taught that kids are to be seen and not heard.\n\nEither way, I would say you're in your rights, but also that I don't see this being particularly unlikely in a small business/small town. Also offering for your project to be put on hold until his schedule resumes to normal may be a good way to approach it.\n\nNAH I think.", "NAH. This is a safety issue more than anything else.

Just be clear that you don't feel comfortable with an unsupervised child in your house.

Five-year-olds need close supervision.  I can feel for any working parent struggling with childcare; been there myself.

Why make it harder for one you've found to finish the job? If the child has shown that she is polite, well-behaved, and respectful of your home, where is the issue? Children are much more capable than we give them credit for.  A five year old who has been brought up to be self-sufficient and self-entertaining is going to know how to behave.  Perhaps it's a cultural thing.  I, personally, have no problems with contractors bringing their kids to my place, whether I'm there or not.

I do have a son but he\u2019s school-age so he doesn\u2019t really factor into the scenario since he\u2019s gone until the afternoon.", "I wouldn\u2019t normally mind, but he\u2019ll be at my house for the next two to three weeks and I worry that if I don\u2019t say something now then I\u2019ll be required to watch her for all of that time.", "So op is supposed to be free childcare for the man they've hired to work on the house?", "Yes, no judgment on you:).  I just know I\u2019d probably do it so I was being honest lol.  I feel sorry for her.", "What part of \u201cnot saying it\u2019s what you should you\u201d don\u2019t you understand?", "OP can follow up with a text a little later \"Hi, thanks for the chat today and being so understanding about my concerns. I'm glad we were able to agree that you would no longer bring your daughter with you to work. I'm happy for you to reschedule anytime you need to in order for you to care for her.\"", "Oh heck no and for about eleventy billion reasons  YWNBTA. This doesn't even fit the model of bringing your child to work and having the boss or a co-worker watch her. This is taking your child to work and making YOUR CUSTOMER watch her! Non gratis at that. Did he give you any discount on the labor? Did he offer to pay you? And he thinks he going to leave the child alone in your house??  You are paying top dollar for his services while he is disrespectfully exploiting your services and your home. And what a ridiculous thing to say that you don't understand how difficult childcare is. SAHMs ARE are the child care which obviously precludes going out and earning money. So yeah you get how expensive it is in lost wages. You need to start valuing your work as a SAHM, Mama. I'd be issuing him a clear nix on bringing kiddo AND a bill for babysitting her.", "Are you sure he\u2019s planning to bring her again. If he does, I\u2019d just say she needs to stay with him - the hall outside the bathroom.  It\u2019s not fair but I sat in the corner reading books or playing dolls while my dad worked. But you should never be made to feel like this child has invaded your home. She\u2019s with the work crew or not there.NAH", "If the child gets hurt or breaks something in your house then it\u2019s a problem. Anything that happens on your property could cause a issue with your insurance company and that\u2019s the reason why contractors have to be licensed to protect themselves and the homeowner in case of an accident. Twice was enough and now he\u2019s taking advantage so you should definitely tell him that you don\u2019t want to be responsible for his kid left unsupervised in your home because there\u2019s no way that he can watch her and do his job. NTA.", "You're right fine person!", "Yea I mean if the guy asked me if he could have his kid with him for a day while he was working I would have said sure and kept an eye on her so he didn't have to worry. \n\nAlso if he offered a little discount for it I probably would have said sure. \n\nBut just letting your kid run wild without bringing it up is a no-go.", "Or if he says he can't work unless he brings her and your ok watching her, he needs to knock some money off the job. He is essentially charging you to watch his kid while he works on your house and that's fucked up. He can either pay for a baby sitter or pay you if your willing but he doesn't get free childcare just for working on your house.", "I understand what you are staying and I would feel the same way too. I also understand something is going on in his life that he has to bring his child with him. I would ask him about his situation and if need be, I'd care for his child while he worked in my home, I would also ask for a reduced rate.", "Sounds like a potential problem if the child is hurt while in the home.", "It's not a problem until you make it over. If the kids doesn't cause a mess or incident, shut up. Just let it be. If something happens, it goes out of what you pay him and he'll have to keep her out of the house.  I hope he's an insured contractor. If not, that could cost you big time.", "If something happens to his young, unsupervised child in OP's home, she will be liable and her contractor could go after her homeowner's insurance. This is true of *any* accident that happens on her property, with the exception being the contractor having his own insurance / workman's comp for him and any of his workers. His daughter would likely not be covered under that.", "You would absolutely be liable. Even if your contractor has insurance for him and his workers, that doesn't cover bringing his kid on the worksite. It covers worksite injuries only. Since the child isn't working there, it isn't her worksite.", "NTA and since you're providing free childcare can that be deducted from the price? But no, tell him its unacceptable and leave it at that. You did it the first time so hes going to continue to do it little by little bit. I had imposing ass people.", "I mean, that just mean another day of childcare. Instead, sending the message after she had to leave of, \u201chey, daughter is lovely, but I\u2019m not comfortable having a child in my home unsupervised for safety reasons and I can\u2019t guarantee I\u2019ll be home all day while you\u2019re here, so if you\u2019re unable to find childcare for daughter, I don\u2019t mind you taking the day off with just a heads up. Thanks for understanding!\u201d"]}
