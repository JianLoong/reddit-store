Especially after he abruptly quit his management job & struggled at a new location as a car salesman. Since then, we have withdrawn all of the money from the account to avoid any fees. In July, we separated, up until that point, my husband had been the only \u201cbread winner.\u201d After our separation I began bartending, which paid me pretty well & allowed me to continue being a full-time student. We got back together sometime late September and in October my job shut down after our cook quit in the middle of a busy Friday night shift. Since then, my husband has been the only one employed. He says I don\u2019t need a job since he is now doing a lot better, which he has, & this way I can focus on our 3 girls, school, home, & him. However, he has continued to withdraw every penny from the account after every pay period. Yesterday I told him how much it sucks that I have to ask him for money & he gives me $60-$80 a week. I comute to school every day (1hr away) & so this barely covers my morning coffee & gas. He said he understood but he does not want me working. Yesterday was his day off, on my way home from school I asked if he wanted me to stop by for lunch since I had an early day, he said yes & I got us & our youngest something quick. He knew I only had $40 & after Taco Bell, I was left with $8. This morning a small $500 bonus check came into the account, so I figured I\u2019d be fine to pump gas & get myself breakfast. He left to work & I started to get ready for my commute. Before leaving the house I checked the account again & he had withdrawn all of it & left me $20! I was so upset, I texted him \u201coh gee, thanks for my allowance!\u201d He immediately called me & said he didn\u2019t need the sarcasm today. I told him I had just expressed how frustrating it is to be treated like a child yesterday & here he was again doing it. He then said \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot to leave you extra cash this morning but I thought $20 was enough for coffee\u201d to which I responded \u201cit just seems like sometimes you don\u2019t think about me & my day to day. I have to pump g-\u201c & he interrupted to say \u201chow about before you tell me to fucking think you think before you speak\u201d for context, a couple of weeks ago I told him I HATED when he said \u201cdon\u2019t you fucking think\u201d to me after an argument when I fucked up or hurt his feelings, so he said me saying that was wrong & I shouldn\u2019t ask for what I can\u2019t give. After he said that I told him \u201cyou know what I\u2019ll just see you or talk to you later\u201d to which he responded \u201cno, you\u2019re not\u201d & hung up. \n\nAbout an hour ago he texted me saying \u201cso you can\u2019t text\u201d to which I said \u201cit seems like you didn\u2019t want to hear from me today\u201d & he replied \u201cwell after the bs I got\u201d\n\nAm I the asshole & should I apologize?\n\nEDIT:\nQ: \u201cWhere is the money going\u201d\nA: when I say we had been struggling, we had been strugglinggggg. We were behind on rent & bills living on a very tight budget. Sometime in July he started a new job which has been paying him very well. We have been doing so much better & I know he has some money saved up now. However, I only get whatever he gives me for the week. \n\nFor those of you commenting on me spending money on coffee, please \ud83d\ude2d he gets a 6pck of beer a day, nicotine puches, energy drinks, & hates taking lunch from home so he always eats out. I pump about $40-$60 of gas a week to get to school & back. I\u2019m not getting Starbucks everyday with $80/week \ud83e\udd72. \n\nQ: \u201cwhy did you separate in the first place & why did you get back together\u201d\nA: he wanted to explore swinging/having 3somes. I told him this was something I was not interested in IF we got married but, we could if we stayed engaged. He said he didn\u2019t need any of that & only needed me. One day in July after our March wedding we were at home drinking, watching a movie, & being silly when he brought up the 3some thing. I said \u201cI will tell you the same thing I told you before we got married, if that is something you need we do not need to be together.\u201d He immediately got cold & distant & a huge fight broke out. He left that night with a few of his things blocked me on social media & changed all of his profile pictures. A day later he had added all of his Exs so, I started looking for a job. We got back together after talking everything out, it seemed like it was a miscommunication & he wasn\u2019t asking for a 3some he simply had questions on why I didn\u2019t want one & things got out of hand because we were both tipsy.

Girl if you don\u2019t leave this man\u2026", "You need to get back to work because *he is financially abusing you*.", "NTA.  Why are you with this guy??  He's a complete controlling AH!  He talks to you as though you are a child, the way he insults you too!  He takes all the money and leaves you a pittance of 'allowance'?!  He's abusing you and you need to divorce his ass!", "This is financial abuse, and why cant you transfer the money you need when you see it considering you\u2019re most likely the home maker and taking care of the kids", "NTA. He's being pretty awful. Insisting you don't work, and then barely sharing what he makes? Super controlling of him. Tell him that if he doesn't start treating you like an equal with full access to the family's finances, you're going to assume they are his finances only, and start working so that you have your own and can buy yourself the things you need and want.", "NTA - OP you are being financially abused. If he wants to be the sole breadwinner, that means he makes money that is for the *both of you* to use. Not for him to have sole possession of and give you allowances. He\u2019s not your parent. He\u2019s your partner.\n\nAnd the way he lost it on you? No ma\u2019am. Get a job so you can get money. And if you need to, *get out.* To me it sounds like he doesn\u2019t want you having money because he wants you *dependent* on him.", "NTA, at all.  You have nothing to apologize for. Your husband is subjecting you to financial control both by leaving you with very little money and by not wanting you to work.   He wants you to be dependent on him, and he is rude to you on top of it.  You have a right to be treated with respect and courtesy, and to have your own money.", "You should get a job. He\u2019s only giving you enough to leave and come back home. He\u2019s trying to make it so you don\u2019t have a way to leave him again. He wants you as dependent on him as possible. Get a job, get your own account, and leave.", "You should rethink being in a relationship with someone who wants to control finances like this.

This is financial and emotional abuse. There are too many red flags here to list.", "NTA but you are in an abusive relationship and you need to get out before it escalates.", "You have 3 children, and he just decided to quit his job? He doesn\u2019t seem to care about you, or them.\n\nHe is holding you back.\n\nNTA.", "NTA and don't you dare apologize. He is financially abusing you by controlling your money and not letting you work. I know lots of SAHM who don't have to beg for coffee money. It's demeaning.\n\nLeaving him was a good thing for you to have done. Do it again. Get a job and spend the money you earn. He is treating you like a child with an allowance.", "Why are you with an abusive man who has no regard or respect for you?  That's the real question you need to be asking yourself.", "One of the early signs of abuse is controlling money. Thereby controlling you and what you can and can't do. I honestly don't think this marriage can be saved. You should get a new job and set up an bank account in your name only and start planning your escape...I mean move out...", "NTA please get away from that relationship. You left once you can do it again. And stay away!", "He withdraws all the money -where's it going? It has to be going into another account because you don't pay cash for rent/mortgage, electric, etc. What happens in case of a medical emergency? Kids need meds? hospital visit? It sounds like he's hiding money. Do you have access to this account?", "NTA.\n\nGet out!\n\nAs soon as you can, get out! He's making you totally dependant on him to exist. For your own sake and for your daughters' sakes don't accept this as a normal way to live.\n\nGet out!", "NTA, this is financial abuse!", "This is financial abuse and a big red flag get out asap", "NTA\n\nGet a job, as you are in an unhealthy financial situation. Even if it starts a fight and/or even if he promises to stop leaving you in the lurch moneywise, ***get a job.***\n\nI promise you, you and your daughters will be grateful for it. Having your own money, preferably in your own account, will immediately help with some of the stress.\n\nAlso, I don't know what you're studying or what arrangements you and your husband have, but it seems like he wants you to remain a stay at home mother and that desireikely won't disappear after you graduate. Have a long hard thought on whether this current situation is how you want to live the rest of your life/marriage.", "What's wrong with him now is he realised you are perfectly capable of being self sufficient without him and he didn't like it so now he is financially abusing you to knock you down, he doesn't want you to work to keep you down and so you have no independence.  Get your job back and ditch him, you are worth more than begging for his 20 dollar scraps.  NTA", "NTA. Time to find another bartending job and keep moving out. That is crap what he is pulling.", "NTA but why are the two of you together? Do you even like each other?", "Ew ew ew! YTA if you continue to stay! Think it\u2019s healthy for your 3 girls to see their father treat their mother this way? This truly is an abusive situation. You do need to work and get out", "NTA, not by a hot minute mile. I hope your exit strategy is brewing baby, this isn\u2019t going to get any better.", "This is a huge red flag. He's trying to keep you financially dependent and he's controlling you in a significant way. I don't know why you separated, but I suggest you consider it again because frankly, this is very worrisome. He doesn't want you to have enough money to do anything that doesn't involve asking him. Think about that. That means he has to okay all your spending, know everything you're doing, and what exactly is he doing with the money? No, this is bad. Get out. NTA", "He\u2019s financially abusing you. Nta\u2026 good luck", "NTA Get another job and get your own account.  Even if it's just bar tending on the weekends. You obviously can't rely on him to give you money for necessities without reminding or asking him. This is very controlling, on his part, and it's a big, red, flag.  He isn't restricting his own budget like he is yours. You may be able to work through it, but I guarantee you'll feel better if you have your own money.  If he complains about you working tell him it's because you don't enjoy being feeling like a child on an allowance and you can't count on him.", "I think a job will help you deal with no marriage better than this marriage will help you deal with no job.  NTA", "INFO: Is he controlling about other things, or only money? I understand why you separated, but why get back together? Would you say he's verbally abusive? Is he ever more than verbally abusive? \n\nEither way, **NTA**. He demands you don't work, then controls what you can and can't have financially.", "NTA.  Your husband is financially abusing you. He is making it so you can't leave again.\n\nGo back to bartenders. He can parent the girls while you work.", "ESH\n\nYou should have more access to your money. I don't want to say it's definitely financial abuse but \"you don't need a job, I can support us but screw you having more than 'just enough' money\" is concerning.\n\nBut if you're having trouble with your finances, stop eating out and definitely stop getting coffee every morning. Make it at home. Even if you have to buy a coffee maker, the difference in expense is staggering.", "This is financial abuse.  RUN.", "NTA. Also, he shouldn't be in control of the money. You both should be. That isn't a healthy power dynamic in a marriage.", "NTA.\n\nBTW, he sounds like a really nasty person. Then again, he was a car salesman ... \ud83d\ude44", "NTA but you need to get a job a degree and leave him.", "You both are being the assholes.

Every single word of this post is a red flag.", "NTA. \n\nWhere is the money going? Why does he withdraw everything and leave you with nothing? What is he doing with the money? \n\nThis is financial abuse. Not allowing you to have enough money for basic necessities, and a little extra to save is putting you in a bad position. And the way he talks to you when you voice your frustration? Nope. Gtfoh. If my husband EVER did any of what you described, I would be rethinking the whole relationship and hiring an attorney and have them bill him. \n\nYou need to look at this like not being paid for your job. You\u2019re taking care of the children (childcare is EXPENSIVE), cooking, cleaning, and taking care of his stupid ass. All of that are things that people have to actually PAY for, and you deserve to, at the very least, be able to pay for your gas and food without hesitancy. \n\nFigure out where the money is going. And get a divorce while you\u2019re at it.", "You need to go get a job immediately", "He sounds abusive and like finances are his way of exerting control over you so you can't leave, so when you pull on that thread at all he lashes out\n\nHe doesn't deserve an apology. He was rude to you and he's treating you like a child exactly as you said. He even dug into something he knew hurts you to get you to drop a subject you're right about; he owes YOU an apology.\n\nThe piece where he sent a bitter message about you not messaging him after he blew you off is also part of his abusive/controlling game -- he can leave or say he's going to, and you're supposed to chase him down & beg for forgiveness. You didn't do that so he got mad at you, and went back to trying to gaslight you about the above so you'd think it was inappropriate for you to hold him accountable or have enough money for your regular commute without having to beg him\n\nNta, but it sounds like you were doing great with that bartending job and separation... Maybe it's time to try and do that again", "NTA for not wanting to ask for an allowance but yta to yourself and your kids for staying in a situation like this. \n\nYour kids are gonna grow up thinking this is what a normal relationship looks like.

Restricting access to finances is a controlling behavior. I'm usually very careful here and much too often the term \"red flag\" and \"get out\" are getting thrown out way too easily, but this time I agree. I suspect by not wanting to get OP a job he is also trying to restrict here contact to other people. (thats a speculation on my part of course)", "Seriously, my mom was a SAHM.
