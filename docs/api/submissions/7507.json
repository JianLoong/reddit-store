His company fired him because they don't want someone like that representing their image. \n\nAs for whether he could have a family that is now suffering because of his actions...

He thought that giving you his business card was going to make him look special or important and all it did was give you all the info you needed to call out his horrifically sexist and racist bullshit.

Well played, madam \n\nNTA", "nta! \ngood for you", "NTA - if he's giving out his business card willy-nilly while acting in an inappropriate fashion, he is bringing his company into disrepute and damaging the business's overall reputation. If you want to act like a knob, you do it on your own time as an anonymous person, not while linking yourself to the company you work for.\n\nIt's really no different to those people who used to make inappropriate comments and posts on the same social media accounts where they were blatantly identifiable as an employee of a specific company. That never ended well either.\n\nYou didn't know this person was going to be fired, you didn't demand it, you simply made the business aware of the situation.

This needed to be reported.", "NTA\n\nprobably wasn't the first time he did this and who knows if it'll be the last (small part of my hopes he learned from this experience).  If I had my own company, there's no way I'd want someone like that working for me.  Employees are representing their company.  Even if dude was off the clock, he used his business card and could have royally screwed things up for the company.  You could have gone to social media and blasted this thing sky high.  Could have reported to the police for harassment and threats.  Could have sued.

Or at least be smart enough not to screw up this bad.", "NTA, only because of the card. By handing you his business card, he presented himself in a professional capacity.

He was asking for it.", "NTA, he probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten fired had he just given you his number and not business card.

I hate social media tattle tale culture. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not Reddit the monlithe. I had a take, you disagree with the take, you reply. That\u2019s how this works.", "So call the cops. That would\u2019ve been the right thing to do when a person at a bar harasses you.", "What you do off works hours is separate from work. Work life balance. He may be an ass but that shouldn\u2019t effect his job", "Dw op, they're probably the one who got fired lmao", "Ah...a Narc then....that makes more sense.", "The moment he decided to use his business card he involved his workplace. We don't know if this was the first time he committed this kind of conduct. If he was fired without cause, he can go after then for wrongful termination. Ball is in his court to demonstrate that this was a one-off, or that he's seeking treatment for alcoholism / anger management. Something tells me this isn't his first time.... NTA", "I'm pretty sure if he wound up arrested and his job got wind of it, he would have been fired due to it.", "While that may be true - In regards to him using racial slurs and sexist terms, that type of mindset usually can carry over into the work place with a lot of \u201cunconscious\u201d bias. He also may be treating customers or clients like that as well, which would then be a liability for the company. The company doesn\u2019t condone racism or sexism and they proved that by terminating him. It could also be that the company has a policy statement saying they don\u2019t tolerate that type of behavior, in which he broke their conduct rules.", "Harassing people is not part of work life balance", "That's not what work life balance means, though. He gave her his business card -unsolicited - so it's logical he should be aware that he was representing his employer in that interaction. Or at least opening himself up to a complaint.", "Ewwwww!  Check out their account and their comments on other threads. Ignore them OP.", "Meh slur excepted tattle tale culture is lame but you have a different take and that\u2019s fine too.", "And that wouldve been ok. It\u2019s not her job to her him fired", "I feel dirty looking at this guy's comments. I've never seen someone behaving so unfuckably all over the internet like this before.", "How else should women deal with sexual harassment?"]}
