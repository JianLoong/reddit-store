I didn't let family help with the baby for the first six weeks, at which time I went out to dinner for two hours. Your husband and MIL are out of line. Their expectations are unreasonable. \n\nMy MIL is the devil but my husband fights for me like a wildcat and enforces consequences when she gets out of line, he did this ESPECIALLY when our kid was a newborn. Your husband doesn't have your back and that's the big problem here. Try the subs r/JUSTNOMIL and r/JUSTNOSO for better advice.", "NTA. First off, I\u2019ve exclusively breastfed three healthy babies who were consistently in the 85-99th percentile at their well-checks, and I have NEVER been able to express milk successfully, even with the high-end hospital rental pump. If I got anywhere close to one ounce in a pumping session, I was thrilled. I have a friend who could nurse her baby full and then pump eight ounces or more. It just doesn\u2019t work the same for everyone, but as long as the baby is getting what they need, who cares? Second, I would question, if your MIL was so dismissive of your effort to exclusively breastfeed, was she honoring your wishes or giving your baby formula during those day-long visits? This could have caused serious problems if your baby had allergies or sensitivities, and you wouldn\u2019t even have known what was happening. Third, stop having babies with this guy. He\u2019s made it clear that he chooses his mom over you and that he won\u2019t support you and your attempt to set boundaries even when you\u2019re at your most vulnerable point physically and emotionally. In any case, don\u2019t you waste one more minute feeling guilty over the rockiness in your relationship with MIL.", "NTA.\n\nYour MIL is so ignorant. Breast milk is vastly superior. Like babies who are breast fed have better immune systems, develop faster, and are fucking smarter.\n\nSounds like the old bottle affected your hubby more than MIL would like to admit.", "NTA", "NTA. Your husband is a massive unappreciative, unsupportive AH.", "NTA.\n\nYour hubs and his Mom are TA.  When your hubs pushes a 7lb watermelon out of his nostril, he can make choices about breastfeeding and anyone's else's right to come and take your baby without notice, for the day.\n\nWell done for setting boundaries.  Stick to your guns!  This isnt MIL's baby and she needs to stop the constant criticizing. He better get on-board with your way of thinking or he xan go live with his Mommy.\n\nYou are destined for divorce if he doeant change his attitude.", "NTA. Why is that lady so obsessed with taking a newborn for the whole day? And why is the husband more in love with his mum than with his wife?", "NTA do you have somewhere to go? Pack up and get there. Your husband is the biggest AH here. His job is to support you while you find your rythm with your baby. \n- If having MIL there is stressful to you then it is husbands job to  her to back off. \n- none of this is any buisness of MIL. If she cant be helpful (as in be helpful in the ways you need help in and keep her opinions s to herself) then she needs to stay away. \n- if you need help talk to doctor or nurse or midwife.", "NTA. But you don't have a MIL problem. You have a husband problem.", "Your husband and MIL were actively sabotaging your breastfeeding relationship. This is so fucked up. You're not the incubator for your MIL's 'babies,' you are the mother. Anyone trying to come take my newborn from me would get ripped a new asshole and then told to get the fuck out of my house. And because he's a good man, and a good husband, and a good father, my husband would be the one slamming the door in their face. I would have never had a second child with this man. NTA but you are for staying with him honestly.", "NTA hubby is though I wouldn't dream of coming over yo a new mums house without calling to see if it's okay especially when all she does is criticise", "YTA!\n\nWhy did you do this to yourself and remain married to that family, just why? \n\nYou deserve better than an unsupportive husband!", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA\nM-I-L has crossed so many boundaries. \nCaring for a newborn is one of the most difficult things, especially when the absolutely best food and method of feeding a newborn, (breastfeeding) is difficult. \nYour husband needs to realize that you and the baby are his top priorities. Mom is now a much lower #3. Part of his job, as the father, is to take care of the baby's mother. \nM-I-L has no rights to the grandchild.", "NTA and your mIL and husband are. They can go fuck right off. I'd be sending your husband to his mother until both can treat you respectfully. Good for you telling him off. His behavior is shitty and has no excuse. I would make sure he doesn't give her a key, and I would simply refuse to let her come over and tell her to shut the fuck up.  \n\nAnd now, from a woman who did not produce a ton of milk. Things you can do that actually help. Drink a dark beer a day. Get fenugreek drops and add them to lactation tea. I drank MOther's Milk Tea from Traditional Medicines, available from your local grocery store. I also pumped to help stimulate production. BTW, my kids refused to drink from a bottle, so once they could eat a little cereal, I mixed it with my expressed milk. \n\nDo not be afraid to supplement with formula. You are not a failure if you don't produce enough milk. Not your fault. You are an excellent mother and don't let your MIL tell you otherwise. She raised a son who would berate his wife at the behest of his mother. Clearly she did not do a good job.", "Parent educator and Newborn Care Specialist here.\n\nNTA x 1,000,000. \n\n1.

HE needs to apologize to YOU, and if you'd like, I'm happy to forward some much-needed information for partners on the challenges of feeding a newborn. Cause he NEEDS. IT.\n\n3. Please don't make anyone make you feel like you're not enough. You could exclusively breastfeed forever or completely switch to formula right now and no one has a right to say anything about it. As long as your child is growing and meeting milestones, they can lick trucks.\n\nThat was supposed to say kick rocks, but I think at this point, they both deserve to lick trucks. Really, really gross ones. \n\n4. For anyone reading this: however you feed your child is okay. Breast Milk, pumping, mixing it up, formula... IT'S ALL OKAY and leads to healthy, happy, children. Do what's best for you!!!", "NTA \nBased on what I read you sound like a nice person who is really bad at Paying attention to red flags.\n\nYour mother has lost her marbles if she thinks it\u2019s ok to do a pop in visit with a new mother ?! And then your husband agreeing to this? AND YELLING at you?! I genuinely hope you are exaggerating that. \nYour husband and his mother are HUGE AH. \nTime to find a good lawyer because I can\u2019t see this ever getting better for you, will just get worse.\nNo boundaries and a unsupported borderline abusive husband? \nMaybe not even borderline. Sounds abusive to me\u2026. NTA NTA but think this marriage thru", "NTA but why the hell is your husband treating you like this and allowing your mil to be like this,", "NTA but I am amazed that having someone take your newborn away from you for the day isn't the biggest issue here. I am 60, with no kids, so maybe all the moms thought back to the breastfeeding issues they had. I just can't imagine a mom being told when she should give up her newborn into another's care. I know a lot of women go back to work relatively soon either by choice or necessity. And some moms with PPD might relish time off but it doesn't sound like that for this mom. What an a-hole this husband is. Doesn't sound like they have talked at all about her feeding and issues with it and her feelings about it. Nor her feelings about someone taking her newborn away for the day.", "Such a NTA its unreal. Its your baby and you're doing what you feel best, as you know its your baby. As for the mil swanning over and thinking she can take the baby for the day without actually asking you, fuck no. My daughter didn't go out of my sight until I was comfortable and she was nearly a year old by then and I had asked my sil to look after her. My mum and mil have never been left with my child because they won't listen when I say to do/not to do something and I'm sorry but its my daughter not theirs and if I wanted their outdated and quite frankly stupid opinions I would ask for them. As for your husband, he just sounds thoroughly horrible\n\nBTW don't feel bad on not being able to breastfeed/pump i had a shitty birth like you too and I couldnt and I had the opposite problem from my mil, how I should breastfeed blah blah blah and in the end she got told if she didn't like it, I cant change it so she can shut up or get out and don't come back.", "It takes time to built up your milk. You don\u2019t just give birth and bam!! Boobs are flowing like a fountain. They are the assholes here 100% Also breast milk is way better for a baby than formula.", "NTA.

I've struggled a lot with breastfeeding and know how hard it can be...\n\nOne thing that you will learn, even if you is the most mild mannered person, is to put your foot down and say no. You'll learn it because it'll be what it takes to protect your child. NOBODY will take your child for the day, or for half an hour, without your permission, even if you had 500 gallons of pumped milk. NOBODY is entitled to show up without notice at your door and expect to be well received.\n\nYour MIL doesn't want you to succeed with breastfeeding because she wants to validate her own choices.\n\nDo not open the door, and do not tell your husband. You can sleep, or pretend to be asleep, during the baby naps anyway, so having your phone on silent is perfectly fine. He is way out of the line with his behaviour. Biologically, your child now needs you, and your need them. His role for now is solely to support the mom-baby binomial, handling relatives, tasks, and making sure you're hydrated, fed and rested.", "Nta, why does he think his mother has more say than you on what's best for your baby?!? No, he needs to man up and not be such a mamas boy. Focus on your babies needs not his mom's wants.", "NTA at all!\n\nBaby tells you how they're going to feed, not the other way around! I tried everything to get my daughter to take breast milk, because she was a preemie and the midwives at the hospital said it was best for her. She struggled to gain weight, took days to learn how to suckle, and just didn't seem interested. I was so stressed I produced less and less milk!\n\nWhen her weight crept up just enough for us to bring her home, we made the decision to try formula. She GUZZLED the stuff and never looked back! She was telling us what she wanted all along, and I regret letting myself be pressured.\n\nAs for this:\n\n>told me that I had better start expressing so she could come over whenever she felt like it\n\nI would have gone ballistic! No one EVER gets to just turn up and take a newborn from the mother! My MIL used to try and take her right out of my arms to walk away and 'show her off' to people. I got pissed off with her and she was still in my sight! The idea of MIL just dropping by and taking her... I would still be furious if she tried this now, and my daughter is eight!", "You, OP are NTA. Your husband however, is the AH. His mother is also TA. His treatment of you is downright abusive when you are trying so hard to exclusively breastfeed. Actually, that kind of treatment is awful any time.", "NTA.  Many don't realize how exhausted the mother is after birth, and how she NEEDS time alone with her baby to bond.  \n\nPeople may mean well by showing up, but it is imposing on you and they should know better to call before coming over.  You have to train people how to treat you!  :)    No call, no visit.   \n\nI remember after my son was born.  I had just come off 6 weeks on bed rest, had PPD, and desperately needed rest.  My relative would not only show up out of the blue, but bring along additional friends and family with her, as if I wanted to party it up!  I just went into my room and cried and let my husband handle it, as I obviously could not.  People can be really REALLY clueless at the absolute WORST times.", "NTA breasts aren\u2019t taps.

You get to decide who sees your baby and when, people don't just get to show up and expect to take your fucking newborn whenever they want. I had an aunt just like your MIL.

Please respect your child's autonomy, because your MIL will continue to stomp boundaries and feel entitled. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm very serious when I say your husband sucks. He is not a good partner.

There's a reason so many moms in the US stop being able to breastfeed, because they have to go back to work so soon, and pumping enough for the baby that early is really difficult. I don't think I started pumping for my kids until after 6 months. They just stayed with me all the time. People could watch them, in my house, when I ran to the store, or hang out with them in the house, while I napped. That's pretty normal. Your MIL's expectations were crazy.\n\nMy real issue is with your husband. I can't belive he didn't have your back. That makes me sad for you.", "Also, why does MIL think she can take a newborn FOR THE DAY?!?", "EXACTLY. It's an attitude like, \"Excuse me, you're hogging my new toy, give it over.\" MIL isn't entitled to even be in the same room as that kid, no one is entitled to time with someone else's newborn, and it's a huge red flag that the husband doesn't see this.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
