Girl, that man is insane.", "NTA but your husband sure is. He has no idea what it takes to breastfeed or how hard pumping is. The gall to yell at you and demand for you to \" start expressing now\".

Well minus the yelling from the spouse but everything else felt very familiar. \n\nAnd, can I just say as a former baby who's mom tried to breast feed but didn't produce enough and who felt pressured into doing it by mom groups (which I can't believe existed pre internet) until her doctor said that as long as I was healthy it didn't matter how I was fed, you're doing great. The only reason I was exclusively formula fed after that was because I couldn't process lactose and soy formula was the only thing I could keep down.  Breast, bottle, doesn't matter because at the end of the day *fed is best*. \n\nAlso...MIL does know about the record number of cases of RSV this year right? And of course there's the still existing *COVID*. Assuming the baby was born this year and this isn't an old story, the little one needs to build up the immune system which is why people tend to request people be updated on their vaccines before handling a newborn/young baby.  And she's coming over unannounced meaning the house is probably a mess which gives her more ammo to glom against you while hogging your child as you essentially do the work of a single parent while your body recovers and your hormones refluxuate. \n\nYou didn't ignore your MIL because you didn't want to see her, you ignored her so your child could *sleep* and MIL is a boundary stomper. Wasn't she ever taught actions have consequences?", "You're NTA but if you are feeding your baby for 6 hours to get enough milk into her, you need to start looking at formula.  That is NOT to say that you need to hand your baby over to MIL with a bottle.  MIL still has zero rights to your baby regardless of how baby is fed.  But baby needs food and shouldn't have to struggle for 6 hours to get it.\n\nI know that a lot of women think they are lesser if they can't produce enough milk for their children, but this is not true, any more than someone is \"lesser\" for any other anatomical quirk.  There is a lot of mommy-shaming out there and especially lactation activists who will ream you out for using formula.  But FED IS BEST and six frickin hours is not a sign of good feeding.", "Leave the husband before it\u2019s too late!

You are the mother who gets to decide whether or not to breastfeed. As long as you can do so and you are producing enough milk for your baby to be healthy and thriving then that\u2019s the best option. Only an ignorant, selfish person would believe that formula made from plants or animal products is better than human milk made specifically for human babies.  It\u2019s a good alternative for those who can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to breastfeed, but it\u2019s not the same as human breast milk. \n\nYour husband is out of line putting his mother before you.
