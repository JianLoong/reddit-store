Your MIL started insulting you and your baby from the get-go with no defense from your husband. Red flag #1.\n2.

Your husband is a prick.  Him yelling at you for not wanting someone to interrupt you while you\u2019re coping with a newborn shows how little he actually understands the difficulties of being a new mom.

Not all of us are successful at breast feeding, so good for you for doing it and standing your ground!", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is a giant AH for making this all about her.  Your child, she doesn't get a say in how you feed, when she can pop in and demand time with the child, etc.\n\nYour husband is also a giant AH for not defending you and prioritizing his mother's needs over his wife's.

Your baby is so new not vaccinated, breastfeed , you try to bond and give her a stable routine , everything a good mom does. There is no place for unannounced visits or take overs absolutely not.
