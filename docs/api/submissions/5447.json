You should put your husband on notice that he either gets your back on this or he can take a hike.\nNTA", "NTA. Regardless of whether you can express, why does MIL feel entitled to take your child away for a day??! Do you WANT this? Your husband is an ass, so is MIL but you are NTA.", "NTA.  \nHis mother doesn't have rights to access your kid if you don't want her to, and showing up unannounced is f'ing rude.  \nAs for your husband, if he wants his mother to be allowed to come in,  then he should be there to let her in, otherwise he needs to shut his face. I'd start expressing, alright. Just not in the way he asked.", "NTA. Show your husband this post.", "NTA. And I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have a husband but instead are rooming in with someone who is still married to their mommy. I exclusively formula fed. Guess who got to give bottles? Me, and my husband. Anyone else didn\u2019t unless I asked them, and they didn\u2019t ask because that\u2019s not their place. End of. \n\nYour husband sounds widely unsupportive. It\u2019s your and his baby, not his mother\u2019s. She\u2019s the grandmother. Who doesn\u2019t get a day in how baby is fed. End of story.", "No you are NTA.  Your MIL is and your husband is as well.\n\nAnd no, MIL doesn't get to come over whenever the idea pops into her head and take the baby.  Your husband was a reall ass for yelling at you over that.", "NTA. Everyone else in this story is.", "If someone tried to take my newborn \"for the day\" within a few weeks of giving birth, I would call the police for kidnapping. I could not be responsible for my actions at that point and someone would end up hurt. \n\nYou do NOT separate a mother from her newborn for A DAY against her wishes. I don't care who the hell you are. \n\nThe fact that your husband thinks his mother should get to just take the baby from it's mother's arms... Girl, that man is insane.", "NTA but your husband sure is. He has no idea what it takes to breastfeed or how hard pumping is. The gall to yell at you and demand for you to \" start expressing now\". You need to get with a lactation consultant and your husband needs to have his ass handed to him by your doctor. \n\nAlso your baby is a newborn, she doesn't need to be passed around or taken by other people. Your husband and Mil aren't thinking about what's best for the baby. They're being selfish and abusive towards you.", "NTA\n\nand... uhh... i don't understand. who the hell comes over to \"take the kid for the day\" when the kid in question is a NEWBORN BABY? even if the baby was formula fed, what the actual fuck? i feel like the mil would've run off with the kid if she'd ever gotten her hands on them, especially with how determined she was that OP was \"doing it wrong\" \\[in the sense of caring for the child\\].", "Honestly OP, this reads like it came from my own family so that automatically gets an NTA from me. Well minus the yelling from the spouse but everything else felt very familiar. \n\nAnd, can I just say as a former baby who's mom tried to breast feed but didn't produce enough and who felt pressured into doing it by mom groups (which I can't believe existed pre internet) until her doctor said that as long as I was healthy it didn't matter how I was fed, you're doing great. The only reason I was exclusively formula fed after that was because I couldn't process lactose and soy formula was the only thing I could keep down.  Breast, bottle, doesn't matter because at the end of the day *fed is best*. \n\nAlso...MIL does know about the record number of cases of RSV this year right? And of course there's the still existing *COVID*. Assuming the baby was born this year and this isn't an old story, the little one needs to build up the immune system which is why people tend to request people be updated on their vaccines before handling a newborn/young baby.  And she's coming over unannounced meaning the house is probably a mess which gives her more ammo to glom against you while hogging your child as you essentially do the work of a single parent while your body recovers and your hormones refluxuate. \n\nYou didn't ignore your MIL because you didn't want to see her, you ignored her so your child could *sleep* and MIL is a boundary stomper. Wasn't she ever taught actions have consequences?", "You're NTA but if you are feeding your baby for 6 hours to get enough milk into her, you need to start looking at formula.  That is NOT to say that you need to hand your baby over to MIL with a bottle.  MIL still has zero rights to your baby regardless of how baby is fed.  But baby needs food and shouldn't have to struggle for 6 hours to get it.\n\nI know that a lot of women think they are lesser if they can't produce enough milk for their children, but this is not true, any more than someone is \"lesser\" for any other anatomical quirk.  There is a lot of mommy-shaming out there and especially lactation activists who will ream you out for using formula.  But FED IS BEST and six frickin hours is not a sign of good feeding.", "Leave the husband before it\u2019s too late! A man who sided with his mom without considering the well-being of his own wife and new born is not worthy to spend the rest of the life.", "OP, in case you aren't aware, your husband sucks.", "Her husband doesn't seem to understand that breastmilk production also goes way down with the kind of stress he and his mother are putting on OP, either, so... yeah.", "I could not breastfeed my first child and was devastated. I breastfed my second child exclusively for six months and then switched to formula because I had to go back to work. Both kids turned out fine.", "Also as a fellow breastfeeding mom, don\u2019t be alarmed if you don\u2019t express well as long as baby is gaining weight. Babies are much more effective at getting to your milk that pumps are. And what you pump is NOT  a good indicator of if your baby is nursing enough.", "Correction: you have a MIL and a husband problem.", "I couldn\u2019t pump at all. My kid took it all lol. Nobody has the right to tell you how to feed your baby unless you\u2019re doing something horribly wrong. Husband can fuck off and take his mother with him.  NTA", "My father in law used to give me lecture on how to take care of a new born. Overreacted whenever my son cried. One day I had to snap him out saying instead of showing fake concerns why don\u2019t you change his diaper and show your true love? Why do you think as a mom I don\u2019t love him more than you do when you have never lifted your finger for him rather than throwing tantrum on small things? The next week they flew back and I was so relieved!", "I find feeding pretty frustrating.  There isn't much to do and some babies are slow for it.  Diaper changes are far more interactive imo.", "But MIL problem is easily solved by divesting of husband.  Two birds, one stone.", "Same. I could nurse them like a champ but could only pump out wasted time and discomfort", "I could pump just fine, but my youngest would not accept anything other than fresh from the source, the little tinker ended up having \u201cboob\u201d as his first word (and also his name for me, rather than mummy, until he was almost a year old \ud83d\ude16)", "Same! I would only get a couple ounces pumping for 40 minutes,", "You would think, but I've read far too many posts on AITA to think it is so simple. However I agree that the husband should step up and mitigate his mother as much as possible."]}
