I lost about 75 lbs towards the end of college with the help of the weight loss subreddit, and have maintained my goal weight (give or take a few lbs) for the last six years. I still keep count of my calorie intake to help myself stay healthy, so I am very familiar with the energy content of most foods.\n\nAnyway, I was out to lunch with my friends and one friend was talking about how she wanted to start getting back in shape\u2014she felt like she had been putting on weight since she had her baby a year ago and wanted to get back down to her pre-baby weight. I recommended Reddit since it helped me, which she seemed interested in, but our other friend Jules jumped in and made her second guess whether she even could/should lose weight at all.\n\nJules claimed to our other friend that eating too little might actually be the problem, that the body will hold onto fat when it thinks you might be starving. She said something like \"I dieted too hard a few years ago and gained weight, and now I can't eat more than 800 calories a day without gaining.\" \n\nNow...I really didn't want to start a whole argument because I know it's a contentious subject, and the belief that \"starvation mode = fat retention\" is very common even if it's not true. But Jules is quite active and athletic herself, she likes indoor rock climbing and goes to the gym regularly. Being able to do all that and maintain her current weight (like 180-190 lbs probably?) on a steady diet of 800 calories a day is just not happening.\n\nI tried to redirect the conversation a bit and reassure our other friend that she could lose some weight if she wanted and wouldn't have to do anything drastic, but Jules took that as a call-out. She asked me if I knew what I was talking about and I said yes, I do actually, and you can't make yourself overweight by undereating. She asked if I was calling her a liar and I said along the lines of \"I can guarantee that you aren't eating 800 calories a day. That's a very low amount\u2014too low\u2014and it would have led to you being underweight.\" She said she had a slow metabolism and I was just like \"That is really not how that works. No one is telling you how to live your life, but you're telling (other friend) stuff that isn't true when she just wants to get healthy.\"\n\nThings are tense now and like...I just hate being in this position. I hate calling someone a liar, especially about such a personal matter, but it's just not true that she has to eat 800 calories a day to avoid weight gain. It's mathematically not possible, and I don't want our other friend to be getting a bunch of misinfo right off the bat. I'm not even really saying she's *lying*\u2014she might genuinely believe it, and that's not like a moral failing or anything.

You are wrong here.  \nWhat people refer to as starvation mode is metabolic adaptation to the amount of calories you ingest compared to calories you need to maintain your current weight. Every time you cut calories, your body reduces its metabolic rate to match your caloric intake. Meaning you consistently have to reduce calories to continue losing weight.  \nIf you cut too many calories too fast, your body rapidly adapts to that, and you cannot lose weight anymore, you have to rebound and restart the diet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you were someone eating 2000 calories per day, and reduced it to 800, your body would not maintain a metabolic rate that would burn 2000 calories in that day, it would reduce its own energy expenditure to only burn 800. it would be a net 0 loss of calories after that adaptation happened. Unless you reduced more calories, or exercised more. Studies show, with a small caloric reduction, this adaptation takes 1-2 weeks. I am not sure how long it would take with a crash diet. Worst case scenario, your body adapts in 2 weeks. So laws of thermodynamics apply, you just havent factored in how metabolism works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you didnt crash diet, and slowly reduced calories, you could reap a steady and slow fat loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI experienced the crash diet metabolic crash.

I realized pretty quickly when I started that my normal portion for that single meal was covering all of my maintenance calories.\n\nI had to reduce that meal to actually start losing anything. That was really eye opening for me. We have very easy access to extremely calorie dense foods, and it's very easy to lose track of all of those calories.", "How much you need to eat to maintain changes with size and gender but less than 1200 calories is never recommended. At 120lbs and a more or less sedentary lifestyle (some walking but little strenuous exercise) I think they recommend 1600 calories for maintaining and 1200 will definitely cause you to lose weight. At 1200 you basically need to go down to 2 meals a day if you are counting correctly and drink mostly water.", "You're probably underestimating how much you eat, it's usually the reason honestly.", "My basic rate without exercise is about 1200 calories.  With normal exercise, it\u2019s about 1600 to maintain my weight.   There\u2019s no way that I could eat 2000 calories without gaining large amounts of weight.  So I take it with a grain of salt.", "Honestly, this ignores a lot of other nutrition facts. If you only ate bread for all of those calories, you'd be gaining weight but still feel starving because you're depriving your body of other things it needs. Or you may be full but feel sluggish. Our bodies need a good mix of foods to feel good and function properly. Likewise, completely cutting fat out can lead to over eating or fat retention (which may be how the other friend got confused) \n\nThere are a ton of interesting body responses based on what you eat, not just the calories you eat. \n\nThe worst is that many people over consume sugar, and that will lead to weight gain even if you're undereating. Or diabetes eventually. \n\nThe BMR also doesn't account for things like breasts or bone/musclemass you have to use a more advanced machine to get a personally accurate reading.", "BMR (basal metabolic rate) is the minimum number of calories for your body to function. It does not include anything beyond that and doesn't take daily activity into account. Any activity at all, like standing up or walking across the living room or running a marathon, whatever, is instead taken into account as part of your TDEE (total daily energy expenditure), which is your BMR plus calories burned through any additional activity. If you eat at or above your BMR, but below your TDEE, you lose weight. You could eat below your BMR if you really wanted to but you don't have to and it's not usually recommended", "Yes. Basically the BMR you calculate is the amount of calories your body needs in a resting state, it doesn't account for calories needed for activities like walking, or exercises, which is why I added the extra information regarding activity levels :) \n\nSo if your BMR is at 1600, you'll lose weight just by going down to 1500. For me I even dipped as low as 1250 at one point but I felt like shit, so I never got below 1500 after that. \nThe best approach is to never make the deficit too large, as you need to sustain the calories and bodily functions and gradually recalculate what your body needs as you lose/gain weight and become more/less active. \nIn the end, losing weight is not a sprint, it's a marathon \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Grats on the weight loss, that a huge number!  \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "For me at the same height and weight my intake was about 1200.", "I believe people develop said belief because certain areas of body tend to hold on to fat more(e.g.: belly), and since they struggle to lose fat in those areas, they get impatient and accuse body of holding onto fat.", "the theory i assume comes from the semi real idea that your body will start eating away at your muscle instead of your fat  bc muscle has more nutrients. this is true to a degree, but the idea youd hold on to all your fat bc your starving is rediculous", "It's what we were even told in school! And do you know, it's easy to believe because I somehow found a few of my friends had an eating disorder at one point and they would get frantically upset if the weightloss stagnated after a few months and they went from a few lbs a week, to a couple of lbs a week to 1 lb a fortnight to nothing for weeks if not weight gain and they certainly weren't eating more, so logic would suggest their body was doing something to cling on to what it could and take more from what little food they were eating. And even now in my older wisdom, I don't know how else that happens. Is it muscle from being more active? Can people even build muscle when severely undereating? I'm clueless, and probably better off for it.", "Yeah exactly, starvation mode is what your body does when it\u2019s starving. It\u2019s not really something you can trick your body into doing by skipping a meal here or there.", "This is how I've always understood it, and now this thread is confusing me, lol! That you'll obviously lose weight in starvation mode, but if you start eating a normal amount of calories again, your body will hold onto it. Is this not true??", "Your second point is a huge one.

So they wave it away and create pseudoscience to feel better - next thing you know they have an obnoxious podcast and they\u2019re claiming that sharing true information about metabolism and calories is the same as homophobia.

So I don't want to hear the excuses, because for all I hear people saying \"It's not that simple!
