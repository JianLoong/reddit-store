I know in the perfect world it would be nice to go thru all of that change without any hiccups.    But I\u2019m telling you now.   This all happened when I was 36 years old.   And even being that old it still effected me deeply that my father left my mother for some younger chick.   Because my mom wanted him to get his drinking and Xanax abuse in check.   (Completely reasonable things to want in a healthy relationship).  But now with his success he\u2019s just acting like a complete idiot.      So my advice to you is.   It may suck that your son is not ok with the situation now.    But if you take the time to put in the work to allow him to adjust to all of the new things going on.   And mind you.  Im a complete teammate when it comes to the LGBTQ community.    But you still need to allow the shock of what his new reality is going to be to set in.    You absolutely cannot force it.

This is her child.   And I don\u2019t know the last time you came across a 20 year old.    But me being 36.   20 year olds are still children.  He\u2019s definitely allowed to not be ok with a situation with his parents.    Let\u2019s not forget that just because your their parent doesn\u2019t mean they are forced to just go along with everything you decide to do as said \u201cparent\u201d.     Parents can still be complete and utter scumbags.   Not saying OP is a scumbag.   Just need to be alittle more understanding of child going thru a struggle", "OP was 19 and her husband was 30 when she gave birth before having an unhappy marriage that she is trying to end. Sorry, if her ex wants to stay legally married that\u2019s on him and OP has every right to go live her life.", "No he's not right.", "Different countries have different laws", "You can feel whatever you want. You don't get to try and control other people and force them to stay in shitty, abusive marriages. Feelings and actions are not the same thing. His feelings are not the issue. His actions are unacceptable.", "What are you replying to? The person above said nothing about men.", "I like how you twisted their words to somehow make it so you're a victim here. Real mature.", "The age difference was big, but also, that post came off extremely cold and OP never elaborated on why they separated, or why they hadn't divorced yet, which added to the tone of doing it for funsies.", "I mean, she is still legally married.", "Um, trust me, men are allowed to show negative emotions...and they do, sometimes violently.", "Who cares? She left before she started seeing someone. People leave marriages all the time, it doesn't make it cheating.", "Where are you getting that the husband's country is somehow better than where OP is from? Nowhere do they mention moving to husband's country because it's 'better'. That also really has nothing to do with anything. \n\nYou can be bi and marry a man...bisexual means that you like both male and female so I fail to see the big issue. It would be different if OP said they were gay and married their husband anyways, that would actually be a problem but being bi doesn't really have much bearing in the situation. \n\nYou are making a mountain out of a mole hill.", "I know I\u2019ll be downvoted to oblivion for this\u2026 But it\u2019s funny how people here are like \u201cthe 20 year old son should grow the fuck up and act like a mature adult, he is 20 not 9\u201d while the mom who had him at 19 is seen as the young innocent girl who didn\u2019t know any better. \n\nIt\u2019s either both should be held accountable as adults, or neither should. Or both should be seen as young people who are/were barely adults still finding their ways in life. I\u2019m close to 30 and I\u2019m still not the perfect mature adult I should be as people here are expecting the 20 year old son to be. That\u2019s a part of what it is like being a human being. Emotions are hard sometimes.", "Yes, especially since the son is an adult, it sounds like he's just shilling for the husband.", ">The mom stayed for years because it was easier then when she wouldn't have to pay child support she left.\n\nThat\u2019s pure speculation pitched as fact. It\u2019s crazy to assume she's manipulating or using the husband when she stated she was afraid of losing her kid.", "He's 20 and he's had TWO YEARS to be ok with his parents divorce. He's behaving like a little shit.", "Dude, I dealt with my parents divorce better and I was 5.", "In the U.S a twenty year can die for their country, vote to pick the leaders of the country, and or go to jail for the rest of their lives for a mistake. Those all sound like adult decisions. 20 year olds that act like children and not young adults had crappy parents. This 20 year old should be old enough to deal with a divorce of his parents. He should want his mom and dad to be happy and should be able to think for and support himself.", "If a 20 year old is still a child, what do you make of OP having a baby with a 30 year old man when she was 19?", "Yeah that's why I'm asking", "Thank you. You said this more eloquently than I would have.", "She is bi", " Not really if she\u2019s legally separated then she\u2019s a legally separated woman not a married woman. It\u2019s essentially divorced but we haven\u2019t worked everything else out. \n\nSomeone doesn\u2019t get to force you to stay married then say you are cheating when you start moving on with your life without them. It\u2019s been 2 years. \n\n\nAlso I\u2019d bet money he cheated on her while they were married. \n\nIf he wants it to be 100% not cheating then he should sign the divorce papers.", "But she's not cheating. She lives in a place that has terrible divorce laws.", "It literally sounds like something a bitter ex-husband would say too when the son yelled at OP.", "She said she couldn't leave because it would risk losing custody of her son. Then as soon as he turned 18 she went for divorce.  That's using him and she said it not speculation.  If she didn't have custody guess who's paying child support?  Why do u think the husband was dragging out the divorce.", "Different post from this morning where the OP was acting utterly without empathy.", "Most women avoid losing custody not because they dont want to pay child support. It may sound insane to you, but we don't see our kids related to dollar signs. Most mothers just don't want to lose custody because..pay attention, this will blow your mind..we genuinely love our kids and want to raise them and be in their lives. I know is a lot to take, but if you concentrate hard enough you may get it.\n\nIn no part it says she didn't divorce for fear of paying child support. This is you twisting her words to fit your incel logic.", "She is very cold with her son, she gonna lost him."]}
