I married and moved to my husband's country shortly before I had my son.\n\nMy marriage was not a happy one. I couldn't leave becasue I would risk loosing custody of my son. When he was 18 I told my husband I wanted a divorce and moved out. My husband refuses to accept it and keeps dragging the divorce on. \n\nSince leaving him my life has been better than it has ever been. I am exploring my bisexuality (I have been out since I was 20 but never explored it), making friends that aren't his and just living my own life.\n\nMy son has been distant since I left my husband. At first he kept asking me to attend couples therapy with my husband, when I started dating he was mad and said I was \"cheating.\" I have spoken with him about this many times.\n\nTonight he came over late unannounced at around 22:30 wanting to talk about an issue with a friend. I had a female friend staying over. My friend got ready to leave so I could be with my son but he got angry and yelled at her for \"breaking up a marriage\". \n\nI stepped in and firmly told my son I have been separated from his father for 2 years and am divorcing him. He kept getting more angry saying I was \"betraying him\". I finally had enough and told him if he can't accept me he can leave. He left and my husband is calling my phone yelling at me that I'm a horrible mother. \n\nAITA? I have been trying to talk to him about this for 2 years to no avail.\n\nEdit: My son doesn't want therapy with him or the two of us. In the beginning we did family therapy which I thought would help us move forward. It was just the two of them trying to make me feel guilty for leaving and asking me to give my husband another chance. The therapist put a stop to it and we didn't go back. \n\nI didn't start dating until a year after separating from my husband.

You deserve to chase after what makes you happy. Your desires don\u2019t directly negatively affect your son. I think his actions are coming from your husband. \nI want to make clear that it is not your responsibility to make your husband feel better. However, going to therapy could be a good idea to help your husband come to terms with the situation. I\u2019d recommend family therapy rather than one on one with your husband because you\u2019re wanting your son to know that you value him but need to be separate from his father for you\u2019re own well-being. The therapist can hopefully make clear to your son that his dad is manipulating him by making you seem like the bad guy.\nSending love!", "I\u2019m gunna tell you from a kid who dealt with his very successful father basically forcing him to be ok with his new girlfriend\u2026.the success part comes in because it has given him this attitude in life where he thinks he\u2019s above people.    It is completely ok for a son to not be comfortable with a situation.     He needs to accept it at his own pace.    I know in the perfect world it would be nice to go thru all of that change without any hiccups.    But I\u2019m telling you now.   This all happened when I was 36 years old.   And even being that old it still effected me deeply that my father left my mother for some younger chick.   Because my mom wanted him to get his drinking and Xanax abuse in check.   (Completely reasonable things to want in a healthy relationship).  But now with his success he\u2019s just acting like a complete idiot.      So my advice to you is.   It may suck that your son is not ok with the situation now.    But if you take the time to put in the work to allow him to adjust to all of the new things going on.   And mind you.  Im a complete teammate when it comes to the LGBTQ community.    But you still need to allow the shock of what his new reality is going to be to set in.    You absolutely cannot force it.    Especially being only 20 years old.", "NAH. You demanded a divorce (with good reason) and it ripped apart your family.

OP may have been unhappy in her marriage, but that doesn't mean everyone else in the family was unhappy.
