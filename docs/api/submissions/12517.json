It would be one thing if that was the only date the venue had available, but even in that case, it should be the type of situation to call her and ask if she's ok with it, or at least assure her that you tried everything to get a different date. It's her *birthday*, and you're clearly aware that it's not that she simply doesn't care, but because of some event that was probably traumatic, and I'm guessing you omitted it because you thought it would make you look bad.

Let them have their day to remember their family and do the decent thing and change the date. There's still time to right your wrong!", ">Do I have to go around asking all my guests if something happened on my wedding date?\n\nWhat a great way to avoid taking responsibility here. The point is you *do know* why this date is traumatic for your step-sister, and going ahead with that date knowingly is callous and selfish. \n\nYou're going to destroy whatever feeble relationship you have with your step-family over this, and if you have that little regard for them, they're better off without you.", "I like how you try to make it seem less bad by saying that her sister married someone that the parents didn't like.  You're truly TA here.", "I hope your fiancee find this post and sees how heartless you are back out of the wedding. \n\nYou seem very resentful of your stepsister and that line \"i just didnt think everyone else had to center life events around her too\" is extremely cruel. It is ONE day of the year. And it is because is traumatic!\nPlease dont get marry, please dont have children, please dont associate with anyone. Go live alone and far from people because you are not a nice person and everyone deserves better than be near you!", "Of all the aitah this one takes the prise. The lack of empathy is just breathtaking, if it's true.", "Absolutely YTA your step sis and her mom have a terrible association with that day. They don\u2019t see that as a good day and even if you married on that day they will always see it as a sad day. Just choose a different day. No point in hurting your family members and honestly sounding so heartless by underplaying the reason.", "What tf is actually wrong with you?! You're fucking callous. I would be disgusted with my fiance if I knew they insisted on a date that carried this sort of family baggage. YTA!!", "Oh no", "I wish you luck in life.", "It\u2019s been edited for a bit now\u2026.", "I could be wrong but I am fairly certain next year *is* a leap year.", "She\u2019s still TAH even if she doesn\u2019t want her stepsister there. She\u2019s most likely doing it so that date will be about *her* forever more because of anniversaries.", "She sees her sister as an unwanted presence in her life"]}
