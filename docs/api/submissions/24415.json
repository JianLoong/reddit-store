If she was that stressed, she could have gone home when you did.", "NTA. That's why they're called EMERGENCIES. Because they can happen at any time. And you weren't sure if gma would make it. I hope she did. But if Sara knows that she's an anxious traveler in other countries without someone who can speak the language, then maybe she shouldn't travel. Because something like this could happen again. Or the group could get separated. Or whatever. And it's not your responsibility to placate Sara.

How is your grandma?", "Sara is... being childish, selfish and an ass.  Accusing you of lying and abandoning her is... yeah. she's being ridiculous and an ass.

Your grandmother had a stroke, for crying out loud.  You obviously had other things on your mind that superseded one nervous traveler.  To be honest, you were never going to be able to soothe her enough for her to accept the situation and you had a plane to catch.  Were you supposed to risk missing the flight to make sure she was ok?  You didn\u2019t leave her alone, there were others there.  If she\u2019s that nervous about traveling, maybe she shouldn\u2019t travel.  She sounds exhausting.  \n\nAs for her demand that you prove your grandma had a stroke?  WTAF?

I've had conversations in a very broken mix of French and Spanish because it's what we had lmao. But come at a French person straight in English and, oh boy are you getting a rude reaction! Which is actually very fair in my opinion.", "Well, yes, a lot of American tourists ignore that we have very strict rules of first contact and when someone comes at you and starts babbling in English without a single polite greeting... oh boy, time to close the fort and roll out the guns. And 'Hi' isn't a polite greeting. \n\nA friend of mine told me she was stunned by how extremly polite we Rude French are in fact. First you say \"Excuse me\", for bothering the person then you say \"Good day\" and only then, once the person has acknowledged you back, can you ask your question. And if you only speak English you should ask if the person speaks English. That's when a lot of us will acknowledge that we do know a bit of English. \n\nSo you can see that the huge grin, 'Hi friend\" American approach is quite a shock to us and we react badly to that breach of politeness.", "Next time tell grandma not to have a stroke until you are home", "NTA", "Sarah is a grown ass adult.

I was also alone, a young woman and I was fine. You did your best. France, as far as I know doesn't have any travel advisories. This was not a trip to a war torn country. She is being very rude and unreasonable to ask for proof. I'm sure it was expensive and very disappointing for you to have to cut your own trip short. I'm not sure if I would be friends with her any more.

Not in *Paris,* no, but in *France,* yes. People in Paris are AHs, but the rest of the country is quite different.", "Not the whole country, just Paris ;-)  \n\n\n(I was once told by a French Parisian woman that when she went back to Paris, people gave her sh\\*t for her language and pronunciation. Apparently she'd been away in the US too long (like, not even half a decade I think), and they didn't consider her \"truly\" Parisian anymore...)", "Often Americans take natural cultural reserve (e.g. waiters not telling you their names and wanting to chat), especially in Northern France, as rudeness.\n\nIf in Paris you go to the same neighboring cafe every morning, say a general \"bon jour\" to the house, try to speak French and are polite, on day 1 you will be ignored. On day 2 you will still be ignored but with less attitude. On day 3 you will get \"bon jour\" back from a few regulars. By day 5 you might have a conversation. But they are not going to act friendly to a total stranger they just met: that's not the cultural norm.\n\nNTA and shouldn't a Canadian know at least a couple of phrases of French? Hello, please and thank you go a long way anywhere in the world."]}
