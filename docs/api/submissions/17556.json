I'm not sure if it's better or worse that it's such a low-impact, zero effort challenge, but either way it's dumb.\n\nIt's perfectly fair to say \"I don't want to do that\", but citing health risks for burritos for a day is dumb. It's a single day of tortillas and fillings, it's like suggesting you're at serious risk of health problems from a day where you eat a PB&J sandwich, a hamburger, and a Monte Cristo.", "INFO...you do realize that you can put anything into a burrito,  right?", "The variety of possibilities makes burritos for every meal seem like an easy win.\nIt might be unhealthy if it were only bean burritos. \ud83d\ude31\n\nSounds like there's a lot more to this than has been presented.", "Esh-just for how stupid this is. A day of burritos wont make or break your health. That being said the idea is just stupid", "NAH. Your dad is continuing the time honored tradition of _Weird Dad Stunts_. It is his job to do that, as it is yours to roll your eyes and hope your friends don't find out how _weird_ your dad is. \n\nEat the burritos and be thankful he's not asking you to grow a matching handlebar mustache for next year's Christmas card.", "Info: Burritos are delicious, and you can fill them with anything you want, so why are you insisting that they\u2019re inherently unhealthy and that you \u201ccan\u2019t \u201c eat them for three meals? You could use the meals to show the diversity of a burrito!\n\nAlso, why is your dad interested in influencers? What\u2019s the story there?", "This is so far the stupidest thing I've read today. Tell your Dad to stay off social media.", "NTA. This is stupid and your dad definitely shouldn't force you into it, but eating a breakfast burrito for breakfast, a relatively nutritious burrito for lunch and a dinner burrito with varied ingredients isn't going to hurt. You can put a lot of different things in a tortilla. They don't all have to be giant Chipotle things.\n\n Maybe sneak an apple in there somewhere for a snack.", "I\u2019m really not understanding how it\u2019s a fuck you to influencers? The whole thing sounds bizarre, you are definitely NTA", "I mean, NTA because it sounds like your dad's got a terminal case of online brain-rot and eating only burritos for a day as a goddamn challenge is dumb as shit, but it's wouldn't really affect your health if you did for a day - like, two meals? Three tops? If worse comes to worst, just use different fillings.\n\nYou still shouldn't be doing because challenges are silly mind virus bullshit though.", "ESH\n\nNo one should be forced to participate in someone's tiktok. \n\nIt's not a big deal. You arguments are weak. Burritos for one day won't harm your health and Mom can argue her own way through this. \n\nIf you don't want to do it just calmly tell him. And offer to be his camera operator or something.", "ESH, one day of only burritos isn't going to be detrimental to your health. If you don't want to join in, no is a full sentence.", "YTA - just for the burrito slander alone. Also, burritos don\u2019t have to be unhealthy, you can put whatever you want in one.\n\nYour dad is trying to have fun with his family, he\u2019s trying to bond with you, is that so wrong?", "NTA. Parents should never pressure their children to he on Tik Tok or YouTube. I'm far more concerned with him trying to force you into his thinly veiled attempt to become an influencer, when he ironically does not like them, than I am with you eating burritos all day.", "I mean, burritos for three meals is fine health wise. Burritos can have lots of different fillings. Eg. Breakfast burrito vs. pork carnitas etc. So that part is a whatever for your dad. \n\nYou should not be forced to eat burritos for every meal if you dont want to. And much more importantly should not be featured on social media if you dont want to. \n\nSuper confused about how this is a fuck you to influencers. This is nothing.", "ESH you maybe more. He's trying a stupid TikTok challenge but he sounds like he's just trying to have fun. You can absolutely eat burittos all day without harming yourself. You can put lots of different things in a tortilla and call it a burrito.", "YTA burritos are life (slightly tainted POV here as I love burritos)", "YTA. These harmless events are the memories you'll have for years. My kids still bring up when I made dinner and I handed each of them an uncut foot long cucumber for their vegetable. And it was 3 years ago.", "NTA - This is not an FU to influencers, it seems like your dad wants to be one. Also, you are right, he cannot force this idea on the whole family. This is not the 50's anymore like he is insinuating with his \"Grandpa made us\" where you better do it or face being hit.", "NTA if this behavior is out of the normal you should raise this concern with your mother as he might need to see a medical professional.", "YTA a day of burritos isn't going to kill anyone. Have you had a good breakfast burrito? Sausage, eggs, avocados, cheese, potatoes, salsa, some pico. Pretty well rounded breakfast to be honest.", "YTA and your dad sounds cool as hell", "YTA, he's trying to do something fun as a family. Also 1 day of eating solely burritos is tnot going to have any real effect on your health", "NTA. There are a couple of things very wrong with the situation you described. First of all, doing challenges like that should be voluntary. If anyone in the family doesn't want to join, they shouldn't be made to join. Second, there is something weird going on with your father when he says it's meant as a fuck you to influencers but it's him who's doing influencer challenges. It doesn't sound like your father is very aware of why he does these things. Third, his comment about his father is worrysome. It sounds like his father had a weird thing for controlling his family by restricting the food they are allowed to eat. Your father might repeat some toxic patterns that he learnt from his father and - again - doesn't seem to be aware of it. Fourth, there is a weird reversal of roles going on where the father wants to do silly challenges and the teenage son tries to be the voice of reason. Other comments have pointed out that your argument that eating nothing for burritos for a day is unhealthy is not convincing. But for me, the important part is that you use reason, the family's health and free choice as arguments, while your father honestly seems rather immature and unaware. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. Keep going your path with as much independence as you can without putting yourself in danger. You'll be 18 soon.", "NTA for not wanting to eat them if you don't want to but it's not going to hurt you so YTA if that's you're only reason.", "YTA. I wish my dad was this cool. \n\nThat being said, a day of burritos won\u2019t ruin your health or kill you. You are getting good food as a meal, you have to compromise and eat it. You\u2019re 16, if you don\u2019t wanna eat what your dad is giving you and everyone else, you can go buy your own meal and eat it outside where he doesn\u2019t have a say.", "YTA. You could 3 different kinds of burritos like breakfast burritos with eggs and stuff in it.  They don't all have to be the same kind all day.  No reason why you can't make your burritos with healthier stuff in them.  Give dad a break at least he is there for you and trying to doing something with you.", "NAH. It\u2019s just a silly challenge, so let him have his fun. Also, one day of eating burritos isn\u2019t going to ruin your health. Burritos aren\u2019t inherently bad for you. And if you\u2019re that worried, eat a salad for all 3 meals the next day.", "I'm going to say NAH because you do have a right to not participate, but dad should be able to do his thing, even if you don't understand it. It's just 1 day.", "Is this real? This is ridiculous.\n\nTell your dad no one gives a shit what he eats, especially influencers. This is not a challenge, some people literally eat like that. Eating three burritos is weird but not hard.\n\nForcing you to follow a weird food ritual is not ok, so NTA. He can do his \u201cchallenge\u201d by himself", "yeah a 16 year old is really so concerned about the unhealthiness of eating burritos for a day that he argues with his dad and takes it to reddit", "Where do you live? I'll give and hang out with your dad and eat burritos for a day. Anytime I don'thave to cook for myself is a great effin day.", "NAH. It's a silly, dumb, cringe TikTok challenge and you're absolutely within your rights to decline your participation but citing health risks is a bit much. It's literally just one day. And you can put pretty much anything in a burrito, though the Mexicans may have some opinions on that.", "ESH.\n\nHe's an asshole for imposing it on your whole family when it's just him who wants to do the challenge. You're over the top with your health lecture. A day of pretty much any food (unless it's, like, arsenic, or something you're allergic to) is not going to harm anyone's health long-term.", "Imagine the flatulence.", "NTA - your dad doesn't get to force you to eat anything, even for a day, especially for silly social media clout.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
