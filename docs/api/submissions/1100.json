I have several children so it was a reasonably decent size shop (though not as big as my normal weekly shop). I had just about finished putting all my groceries on the conveyer belt when a lady (50s - 60sF) lined up behind me. I glanced at her to see how much shopping she had, because usually if someone behind me only has a couple of items I will let them go in front of me. This lady had a whole basket full so I didn't say anything and finished loading my last few items.\n\nEven though she had a smaller shop than me, I didn't let her through for several reasons:\n1. She would need to load her stuff on the conveyer belt (as it was more than one or two items) and my stuff was already there. Her alternative would have been to hand each item individually to the cashier from her basket.\n2. I was conscious of it being close to school pick up time and I had already waited in line behind someone else with a full load, so I did not want to also wait for this lady. If it had been one or two items, I wouldn't have minded, but not a basket full. Obviously she had no way of knowing I was wanting to get through quickly.\n\nThe reason I'm wondering if I'm TA is because when it became obvious I was not going to let her go ahead of me, she scathingly said to me, \"Well you can rot in hell, then.\" \n\nSo AITA for not letting her go ahead of me?", "created_utc": 1667539752, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylpuv6/aita_for_not_letting_a_lady_go_in_front_of_me_at/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not your fault that you've got a crazy lady behind you in line. It's fucked up that she said that to you. You sound like a totally reasonable person.", "NTA There is no rule requiring people with more groceries to let someone with fewer go first.", "NTA. She had a whole basket. If you let her go, surely you'd need to let the next person with less items go too? And the next and the next and the next.. where does it end?\n\nAlso the nerve of her! I assume she actually believes in God and hell and to condemn you to an eternity of suffering for not letting her go first with her whole basket.. Christianity and its kindness strikes again.", "NTA ....\n1.  she had a basket full\n2. Your stuff was on the belt \n3. It's a courtesy not a requirement \n\nMaybe she had a bad day .... or she's the AH.", "Uh yeah, easily NTA.\n\nI'd have had some really choice words back for her.", "NTA, and the audacity of her entitlement!\n\nLetting someone go ahead is a kindness, not a right.", "NTA. She sounds unstable. There are a lot of AHs in the grocery store but you aren\u2019t one of them.", "NTA - a courtesy is not an obligation.  AND, her response to you shows that she didn't deserve the courtesy.", "NTA, You shouldn't let someone else try to guilt trip you for doing something normal, it's not like you cursed,hit etc. She should learn how to wait like the rest and not be so entitled.", "NTA - it was a queue, you were first. Being old doesn't grant her immunity from that", "Nta- one or two items can go before but a whole basket full can wait. Your stuff was on the conveyor belt. Was she supposed to put her basket on top of it", "NTA- you should have replied: well your going to rot in hell long before I can .", "NTA you gave it a good thought and had your items already on there. Removing them would have cost all of you time. Her reaction was completely over the top and rude.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry she said that to you", "NTA at all. The fact that you had already unloaded all of your groceries onto the conveyor belt\u2026 even if she only had five items, it would be a total inconvenience for you to put everything back in your cart. That lady was a total jerk!", "NTA. You wouldn't even be the AH if she only had one item and you were buying one of every item in the store. You got to the line first, so the checkout was all yours.

Especially after she cursed you out in front of your kids. I think most of us try to be courteous... if the first person in line has a lot of stuff and we're next and don't have that much, and we see someone behind us with much less, we will invite them to go ahead of us. But sometimes we don't even see that person until we've started putting our stuff on the conveyor belt. That sounds very much like what happened here. This woman doesn't deserve the courtesy on any level, and I wouldn't even think about her again. I hope that was the first and last time you ever encounter her.", "NTA - you already put your items down, the other lady can wait.", "NTA. \n\nINFO: did she ask or expect you to let her through?", "Easy NTA.", "Ngl for those Christians out there who tell people to go to hell what part of condemning strangers to a supposedly eternal pit of fire and suffering embodies good Christian morals?", "NTA. Her time was no more important than yours. It's that simple", "Actually she can rot. She is so rude.", "NTA. I hate when people with a few items purposefully line up behind me, even though there are other checkouts open, because they just expect me to let them go first. It happened to me today - I was halfway through unloading my cart and this woman lined up behind me and as soon as I made eye contact I could see she expected me to let her go first. She had fewer items than me but not by many. I kept unloading and she gave that put-upon sigh with an eye roll. Lady, you're the one who chose this line, deal with it.", "NTA and that lady was rude AF. I will let people ahead when they have only a few items but a full basket would not meet that criteria", "NTA. I, like you, When doing a large shop will let someone sneak ahead if they have a few items. But by no means would I say this is to ever be expected and I\u2019d never expect anyone to do the same for me. She sounds like a complete cow.", "God-tier response", "\"We're in a grocery store, and have you seen these prices? I'm already in hell.\"", "She didn't ask. I got the impression she may have expected it as she kind of gave off that vibe through her body language, but I wasn't certain until she told me to rot in hell when I didn't offer.", "That's exactly what it felt like with this lady! All the checkouts were busy and she seemed to teeter between mine and the one next to it, before deciding on mine. And it almost felt as though she picked mine because she thought I would let her cut in front of me so she wouldn't have to wait. She was giving off impatient body language as though hinting at me to let go first, then of course made her comment when I kept unloading and didn't offer.", "LOLLL", "Thanks. Since she didn't ask,  that does not mean that she is entitled to be let through by anyone.", "It's so frustrating. I used to live in a suburb where it seemed like everyone was like this. They were always older women. My husband used to joke that he felt like telling them, \"Look, I know you don't have much time left, but you'll just have to wait.\""]}
