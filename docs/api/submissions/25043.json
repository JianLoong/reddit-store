I have never been a fan of weddings for many reasons. Most of all, I\u2019m not a fan of sharing the intimacy of the love I have for my partner in front of other people. For this reason I have never seen myself having a traditional wedding. I live in a state where you can self solemnize and that is what I envisioned for my wedding. However, my husband wanted a more traditional wedding because he loves his family and wanted to share this important time in his life with them as well. I respect my husband and his wishes, so I agreed to have a small wedding. We were only going to invite our immediate family and a few close friends. Including us, we had about 30 people attend. Now here is where the drama begins\u2026\n\nSince we agreed to a small wedding we both didn\u2019t invite our extended families. My extended family live multiple states away and no one lives within 1000 miles. \n\nWhen it came time for me to break the news to my mom that we weren\u2019t going to invite extended family she was on board because no one has put in the effort to come visit us in well over a decade.\n\nMonths prior to the wedding my mom called her mom and let her know that we weren\u2019t inviting the extended family to the wedding. At the time she seemed understanding\u2026 so we thought. \n\nFast forward to after the wedding. My grandmas birthday was a few weeks after. When my mom called to wish her a happy birthday, my grandma proceeded to scream at her for the next hour. Accusing my mom of disrespecting the family by allowing me to not invite the extended family. \n\nThe next day my grandma began feeling chest pains and went to the hospital. I work in cardiology, and this was a smart move on her part to get checked out. Upon arrival, she was cleared from being in immediate danger because her blood test was normal and EKG didn\u2019t indicate that she was having a heart attack. However, no one in my extended family works in any medical field and when the details were being shared with us they spread that my grandma had a heart attack. I was at work when all of this went down. My mom called me up, crying. She blamed herself for causing her mom to have a heart attack because they were fighting on the phone the night before. She asked me if this could have caused her heart attack. Turns out that she didn\u2019t have any intervention because at presentation she wasn\u2019t having a heart attack. She underwent a Cath procedure the next day, just to be safe, and her coronary arteries were clean. With this and the other normal tests, she did not have a heart attack. I do believe that stress from the fight with my mom most likely resulted in her chest pain. But thankfully her heart is okay and she is in good health.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think, none of this would have happened if I just invited them to the wedding.

Reassure you mom that grandma wasn't having a heart attack, and even if so, stress from a night prior wouldn't be a tigger.  Finally, it wasn't your mom's place to \"let you\" not invite people, so that argument goes right out the window.\n\nTL;DR you did nothing wrong.", "NTA you didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your rules. And grandma sounds like she was overcontrolling and wound up too tightly", "Oh God, that's sad but nta", "There has been a lot of blame directed at me. It especially came to a head when we attended my cousins wedding recently and my grandma refused to talk to me. I\u2019ve had multiple cousins delete/unfollow me on social media as well. I feel like there is so much blame and it has really made me question if I am the one in the wrong", "Do you really mean \"panic\" attack?", "Your wedding your choice, honestly this is them trying to abuse you into blaming yourself for her existing health issues and it's not okay I'd just see it as a blessing in disguise that the controlling abusive ahs are all showing themselves out of your life. Definitely talk to a therapist if you can too", "You are absolutely correct.  The trash saw itself out", "NTA. Your choice not to invite her did not cause the chest pains. If anything related to this situation caused the chest pains, it was your grandma's *own choice* to spend an hour screaming at your mother. Doing that was her decision and her responsibility, and the consequences are 100% her fault.", "NTA \n\nJust think of all the drama you avoided at your wedding not having them!", "None of this would have happened if your grandmother hadn't flipped her gourd and decided she was entitled to something she couldn't have and was willing to berate her daughter about it for an hour. Yeah, the only person at fault here is grandma. She reaped what she sowed. NTA", "Your news didn't give your g-ma a heart attack, that's not how it works.

You are entitled to have the wedding your want. It sounds like you are not close to your family anyway. Your grandmother sounds like a hard woman to love. \n\nI bet anything that granny has a lot of screaming fits when she doesn't get her way. \n\nAs an add on: I bet if your family had been invited to the wedding they would have complained about all the expense of having to travel so far.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA - Your grandma wouldn\u2019t have had a heart attack if she didn\u2019t act like a child and work herself up the way she did", "Sure can. My grandfather came home from work and got into an argument with my grandmother's father who had dementia.

This was his second heart attack, but he never would have overdone it that night without that fight.", "\u2026if someone screams themselves into a medical condition, the person they are berating and verbally abusing is not at fault. if she burnt her fingers trying to set fire to your house, would you feel guilty for the blisters? nta.", "Family who blocks you/unfollows you really aren't much family.
