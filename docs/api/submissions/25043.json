I have never been a fan of weddings for many reasons. Most of all, I\u2019m not a fan of sharing the intimacy of the love I have for my partner in front of other people. For this reason I have never seen myself having a traditional wedding. I live in a state where you can self solemnize and that is what I envisioned for my wedding. However, my husband wanted a more traditional wedding because he loves his family and wanted to share this important time in his life with them as well. I respect my husband and his wishes, so I agreed to have a small wedding. We were only going to invite our immediate family and a few close friends. Including us, we had about 30 people attend. Now here is where the drama begins\u2026\n\nSince we agreed to a small wedding we both didn\u2019t invite our extended families. My extended family live multiple states away and no one lives within 1000 miles. \n\nWhen it came time for me to break the news to my mom that we weren\u2019t going to invite extended family she was on board because no one has put in the effort to come visit us in well over a decade.\n\nMonths prior to the wedding my mom called her mom and let her know that we weren\u2019t inviting the extended family to the wedding. At the time she seemed understanding\u2026 so we thought. \n\nFast forward to after the wedding. My grandmas birthday was a few weeks after. When my mom called to wish her a happy birthday, my grandma proceeded to scream at her for the next hour. Accusing my mom of disrespecting the family by allowing me to not invite the extended family. \n\nThe next day my grandma began feeling chest pains and went to the hospital. I work in cardiology, and this was a smart move on her part to get checked out. Upon arrival, she was cleared from being in immediate danger because her blood test was normal and EKG didn\u2019t indicate that she was having a heart attack. However, no one in my extended family works in any medical field and when the details were being shared with us they spread that my grandma had a heart attack. I was at work when all of this went down. My mom called me up, crying. She blamed herself for causing her mom to have a heart attack because they were fighting on the phone the night before. She asked me if this could have caused her heart attack. Turns out that she didn\u2019t have any intervention because at presentation she wasn\u2019t having a heart attack. She underwent a Cath procedure the next day, just to be safe, and her coronary arteries were clean. With this and the other normal tests, she did not have a heart attack. I do believe that stress from the fight with my mom most likely resulted in her chest pain. But thankfully her heart is okay and she is in good health.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think, none of this would have happened if I just invited them to the wedding.
