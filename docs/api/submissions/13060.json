At one point he was living with my daughter and his brother for almost two years and we nearly got divorced. My daughter bonded very strongly to his brother's wife. \n\nCovid opened my eyes and my husband and I have healed a lot and I am repairing my relationship with him and my daughter. I attend sobriety groups and parenting classes. I understand these things take time. However he continously brings my daughter to visit his brother and her wife. If you ask my daughter she'll say her favorite person is her aunt. My daughter can't help this but my sister in law certainly can. She is always calling my daughter \"my baby\", taking her on outings, etc. She will FaceTime my husband just to speak to my daughter. She seems to not want to relinquish the place she took in my daughter's life. \n\nA few weeks ago I took my daughter to get her ears pierced for her birthday. This was supposed to be a special moment for us, it was the same birthday my mom took me. But instead my daughter started panicking uncontrollably and wanting my sister in law. She didn't want to do if without my sister in law there. At this point I decided to put my foot down. I have been trying to decrease the visits and the FaceTimes. But now my husband is catching on. I try to explain my daughter needs to spend time with us as a family without outside influences, and she needs to bond with her mother without being confused. He says I am being selfish. I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. He says that is is unfair to my daughter, and I explained yes it is but he is making it a thousand times worse by not ripping off the band aid. \n\nI have worked so hard to get my family back, meanwhile my husband will not even give me an inch. It's frustrating that I am always made out to be the bad guy when all I want is to fix things.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679645512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120dkop/aita_for_keeping_my_daughter_away_from_my_sister/", "score": 1546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Right now she's not because you truely care only about what you want and what you feel instead of what she wants and what she feels.\n\nThere's so much bonding time in the rest of the 24 hours in a day and it's frustrating that you cannot see this.\n\nEvery small stuff you could do for your daughter (not for you) - brush her hair, sing her songs, watching cartoons, playing together with her toys, reading her stories, looking at the pictures from her birth till now and talking about how much you loved her ever since she was growing inside of you...\n\nThere's a long list with things that you can do... And you ignore everything...\n\nIt's so sad...\n\nYou should start therapy for you - you really need it.\n\nAnd please try and read our advices and start rebuilding your relationship with your daughter - if not you will lose her.\n\nBetween the 2 of you, you are the one who made mistakes.

Taking that away from her only hurts her more, and she will hurt you back in return. There is no limit to love, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s taking the love you should be getting which seems to be your concern which also makes me think you\u2019re a raging narcissist as well as selfish.

Show her that you accept her feelings and want her to feel safe with you. Right now feeling safe for her means her aunt is around. \n\nUnfortunately you need to put your headless feelings aside for the sake of your daughter and allow her to spend more time with her aunt. \n\nMaybe plan activities the 3 of you can do. \n\nJust keep showing up for her.", "YTA.

At one point he was living with my daughter and his brother for almost two years and we nearly got divorced. My daughter bonded very strongly to his brother's wife. \n\nCovid opened my eyes and my husband and I have healed a lot and I am repairing my relationship with him and my daughter. I attend sobriety groups and parenting classes. I understand these things take time. However he continously brings my daughter to visit his brother and her wife. If you ask my daughter she'll say her favorite person is her aunt. My daughter can't help this but my sister in law certainly can. She is always calling my daughter \"my baby\", taking her on outings, etc. She will FaceTime my husband just to speak to my daughter. She seems to not want to relinquish the place she took in my daughter's life. \n\nA few weeks ago I took my daughter to get her ears pierced for her birthday. This was supposed to be a special moment for us, it was the same birthday my mom took me. But instead my daughter started panicking uncontrollably and wanting my sister in law. She didn't want to do if without my sister in law there. At this point I decided to put my foot down. I have been trying to decrease the visits and the FaceTimes. But now my husband is catching on. I try to explain my daughter needs to spend time with us as a family without outside influences, and she needs to bond with her mother without being confused. He says I am being selfish. I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. He says that is is unfair to my daughter, and I explained yes it is but he is making it a thousand times worse by not ripping off the band aid. \n\nI have worked so hard to get my family back, meanwhile my husband will not even give me an inch. It's frustrating that I am always made out to be the bad guy when all I want is to fix things.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now, you're trying to make up for it, but you're forcing a situation where your daughter will feel abandoned by your SIL - someone who is very important to her. You will end up making your daughter live through the trauma of abandonment AGAIN. \n\nYou need to realise that your SIL taking care of your daughter when you couldn't is a good thing. It's a good thing your daughter was well taken care of and loved while you couldn't do that for her. It's a good thing that your baby loves her, because that means that she was with someone who was good to her.\n\nYou are absolutely right to feel hurt by this, but you're ultimately going to destroy a lot of things including your baby's trust in the world and your relationship to her, if you continue this route. \n\nTalk to a counselor. Talk to your husband. Talk to your SIL. But do not force a child away from a person that this child feels incredibly close to. \n\nYou need to work on your relationship to your baby SEPARATE from your baby's loving and healthy relationship to her aunt. It's a good thing she has that relationship. Taking that away is wrong, and it's specifically wrong because without a doubt the person hurt the most by this will be your child, and it will impact her for life. \n\nPlease please please take the comments to heart. It's okay that you feel hurt by the fact that your baby is so close to your SIL. It's okay that it breaks your heart when she cries for her and not you. But that's, frankly, not your child's problem. That's something YOU need to work on. \n\nYour child didn't choose this. She didn't choose to grow up with her aunt instead of her mum. She didn't choose that her mum couldn't take care of her for a while.

It's understandable,  but it's really not a good thing for your daughter.  \n\nSee this as a benefit, she has more trusted people to go to when she needs to, many people wish that family would be closer to their kids, and don't have that benefit.  Your SIL is a \"supplimental\" caregiver who was a primary for a while, and it takes time for kids to adjust.  There are people who also have no prior issues, and their aunt/uncle/grandma/grandpa are the favorite person for a child.  This is not a slight to you, but a good thing for your child.\n\nAgain, it feels like a slight because of the past and the things you're working through.  Be honest with yourself about your feelings, but don't further harm your relationship with your daughter by taking away one of the important people in her life she has learned that she could rely upon.  It is an unfortunate byproduct of her not being able to rely on you for a time, and that sucks, but you need to realize that this is something that came about because of your own actions, and it will take your actions to repair. \n\nIf you succeed in driving a wedge, your daughter could one day have abandonment issues, not understanding why the important people in her life disappear, or worse, she could know you drove this to happen and she may end up resenting you and cause the relationship between the two of you to get worse over time, and I'm sure you don't want that.\n\nYTA if you follow through with this course of action.   And I understand that you feel your husband is making decisions without you or that he is disregarding your concerns, but at this point in time, you're also earning his trust back.  None of this comes overnight, not saying you expect it to, but it's probably going to be a longer road to travel than you are expecting, and you need to exercise patience with those who feel wronged by your absence and substance abuse.\n\nTry not to take all this as punishment. It isn't.  It's work.  It's hard.  And you need to exercise patience with yourself most of all because all im reading in your post is \"wits end\" kind of thinking.  This will do you no good in repairing what you lost.  You may not ever get back the things you lost, but you can get to an even better place, but only if you're willing to do what's right for others first.  What was a selfish string of actions is what got you into this situation in the first place.
