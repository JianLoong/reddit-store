At one point he was living with my daughter and his brother for almost two years and we nearly got divorced. My daughter bonded very strongly to his brother's wife. \n\nCovid opened my eyes and my husband and I have healed a lot and I am repairing my relationship with him and my daughter. I attend sobriety groups and parenting classes. I understand these things take time. However he continously brings my daughter to visit his brother and her wife. If you ask my daughter she'll say her favorite person is her aunt. My daughter can't help this but my sister in law certainly can. She is always calling my daughter \"my baby\", taking her on outings, etc. She will FaceTime my husband just to speak to my daughter. She seems to not want to relinquish the place she took in my daughter's life. \n\nA few weeks ago I took my daughter to get her ears pierced for her birthday. This was supposed to be a special moment for us, it was the same birthday my mom took me. But instead my daughter started panicking uncontrollably and wanting my sister in law. She didn't want to do if without my sister in law there. At this point I decided to put my foot down. I have been trying to decrease the visits and the FaceTimes. But now my husband is catching on. I try to explain my daughter needs to spend time with us as a family without outside influences, and she needs to bond with her mother without being confused. He says I am being selfish. I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. He says that is is unfair to my daughter, and I explained yes it is but he is making it a thousand times worse by not ripping off the band aid. \n\nI have worked so hard to get my family back, meanwhile my husband will not even give me an inch. It's frustrating that I am always made out to be the bad guy when all I want is to fix things.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679645512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120dkop/aita_for_keeping_my_daughter_away_from_my_sister/", "score": 308, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You shouldn't make your daughter pay the price as well by trying to stifle her relationship with a family member that she clearly loves and trusts.

You've got a long road ahead of you to earn back her trust and build a healthy relationship with her, and you can't force it to happen faster by isolating her from people that you feel threatened by. \n\nIf you're in recovery, I would talk to your sponsor about how you feel, and the difficulties they and other recovering addicts have faced trying to rebuild relationships and make up for the time they lost because of their addiction.

If you stay sober then you will get that bond back with your daughter but give her time. Your daughter is still young and even if you have been sober for a couple of years now, it's still new. Your daughter can have a good relationship with both of you. The reason she wanted her aunt when getting her ears pierced is because the relationship with you is still broken.

What you\u2019re doing, or want to do, is just cause your daughter more pain, which I know you don\u2019t want. \n\nSince your daughter trusts/loves your SIL so much, perhaps you should sit down with her and discuss your feelings. Ask if you can be included in some of their times together, their outings and calls and things. Ask her is she can begin expressing to your daughter how mommy is trying to do better, etc. Yes, you will feel like the outsider because you are.

You're only going to make the relationship more strained and resentful. Stop putting your foot down, and move at your daughters pace. Her aunt was there for her in her formative years, especially if they were together for lockdown they're going to be comfortable and used to each other, and have a bond you can't recreate.

Love and trust is earned and ripping a loved one away from your daughter is going to cost you more trust and love. You should be thanking your sil for providing loving and affection to your daughter over the years where you were more concerned with making yourself feel good with substances rather than caring for your child. Taking that away from her only hurts her more, and she will hurt you back in return.

At one point he was living with my daughter and his brother for almost two years and we nearly got divorced. My daughter bonded very strongly to his brother's wife. \n\nCovid opened my eyes and my husband and I have healed a lot and I am repairing my relationship with him and my daughter. I attend sobriety groups and parenting classes. I understand these things take time. However he continously brings my daughter to visit his brother and her wife. If you ask my daughter she'll say her favorite person is her aunt. My daughter can't help this but my sister in law certainly can. She is always calling my daughter \"my baby\", taking her on outings, etc. She will FaceTime my husband just to speak to my daughter. She seems to not want to relinquish the place she took in my daughter's life. \n\nA few weeks ago I took my daughter to get her ears pierced for her birthday. This was supposed to be a special moment for us, it was the same birthday my mom took me. But instead my daughter started panicking uncontrollably and wanting my sister in law. She didn't want to do if without my sister in law there. At this point I decided to put my foot down. I have been trying to decrease the visits and the FaceTimes. But now my husband is catching on. I try to explain my daughter needs to spend time with us as a family without outside influences, and she needs to bond with her mother without being confused. He says I am being selfish. I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. He says that is is unfair to my daughter, and I explained yes it is but he is making it a thousand times worse by not ripping off the band aid. \n\nI have worked so hard to get my family back, meanwhile my husband will not even give me an inch. It's frustrating that I am always made out to be the bad guy when all I want is to fix things.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're too much about control, jealously, and insecurities.

A firm YTA!", "you sound like you were in a very hard spot in your life, and understandably it has taken a huge toll on the relationship to your daughter. I'm glad you're better now and are in a place where you can be there for her. \n\nHowever, you need to realise that you're only going to harm your daughter if you try to do this by taking away the person who has been there continuously for your daughter when you couldn't be. \n\nWhatever the reasons were, however understandable they were, what happened between you and your daughter in the past was an abandonment, and I'm not saying this to judge to, I'm saying this as a fact. Now, you're trying to make up for it, but you're forcing a situation where your daughter will feel abandoned by your SIL - someone who is very important to her. You will end up making your daughter live through the trauma of abandonment AGAIN. \n\nYou need to realise that your SIL taking care of your daughter when you couldn't is a good thing. It's a good thing your daughter was well taken care of and loved while you couldn't do that for her. It's a good thing that your baby loves her, because that means that she was with someone who was good to her.\n\nYou are absolutely right to feel hurt by this, but you're ultimately going to destroy a lot of things including your baby's trust in the world and your relationship to her, if you continue this route. \n\nTalk to a counselor. Talk to your husband. Talk to your SIL. But do not force a child away from a person that this child feels incredibly close to. \n\nYou need to work on your relationship to your baby SEPARATE from your baby's loving and healthy relationship to her aunt. It's a good thing she has that relationship. Taking that away is wrong, and it's specifically wrong because without a doubt the person hurt the most by this will be your child, and it will impact her for life. \n\nPlease please please take the comments to heart. It's okay that you feel hurt by the fact that your baby is so close to your SIL. It's okay that it breaks your heart when she cries for her and not you. But that's, frankly, not your child's problem. That's something YOU need to work on. \n\nYour child didn't choose this. She didn't choose to grow up with her aunt instead of her mum. She didn't choose that her mum couldn't take care of her for a while. She isn't choosing that now you're back in her life so you decide she can't see the people anymore who she was always taken care by, who always were there for her. \n\nIt's great that you're doing better, it's wonderful for you and for your daughter that you're in a place where you can have a relationship with your daughter, don't ruin it. \n\nYTA", "There so much I wanna say but don't wanna get banned. \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. You have a place in your daughter's life by building your relationship with her.  Trying to steal her aunt's place will only push your daughter away from you.

It would be absolutely devastating to me to have my child prefer someone else. \n\nHowever.\n\nYou created this situation - if you were in the throes of addiction, it wasn't necessarily an intentional choice and it doesn't make you a bad person, but you damaged a lot of relationships. You have to do the work to repair those relationships and you also have to respect the fact that your family found other means of support. You absolutely need to prioritize your daughter and her feelings in this. You don't get to swoop back in and just displace everyone else who was there for her, and frankly, you should be thankful that she \\*had\\* enough supportive and loving adults in her life that she made it through this unscathed. \n\nKeep working and don't deny her her feelings.

Neglect? \n\nThe best thing for your daughter is to have her aunt in her life. A child needs stability, and you are not there yet. \n\nIsolating your daughter from those who love her and have always been there for her so she only has you is selfish and cruel on your part. \n\nYou hurt your daughter and her ability to trust you.

They are their favourite people in the whole wide world. Mum and Dad are irrelevant when Nana and Pops are around. Does that sting sometimes? Yeah, a little. Do we keep them apart? Hell no! These kids need their grandparents like they need us. They benefit so much and it is vital for them to keep the relationship tight.

Would it hurt my feelings if my daughter went to our neighbour instead of me with questions? Absolutely. But it's not about me. I need to put my daughter and her feelings first, just like you need to learn to understand that it's in your daughter's best interest to continue to have this close relationship with her Aunt.

And I understand that if you were far enough or stable enough in your sobriety journey you wouldn\u2019t be approaching this so self centered. just know they don\u2019t owe you anything.
