At one point he was living with my daughter and his brother for almost two years and we nearly got divorced. My daughter bonded very strongly to his brother's wife. \n\nCovid opened my eyes and my husband and I have healed a lot and I am repairing my relationship with him and my daughter. I attend sobriety groups and parenting classes. I understand these things take time. However he continously brings my daughter to visit his brother and her wife. If you ask my daughter she'll say her favorite person is her aunt. My daughter can't help this but my sister in law certainly can. She is always calling my daughter \"my baby\", taking her on outings, etc. She will FaceTime my husband just to speak to my daughter. She seems to not want to relinquish the place she took in my daughter's life. \n\nA few weeks ago I took my daughter to get her ears pierced for her birthday. This was supposed to be a special moment for us, it was the same birthday my mom took me. But instead my daughter started panicking uncontrollably and wanting my sister in law. She didn't want to do if without my sister in law there. At this point I decided to put my foot down. I have been trying to decrease the visits and the FaceTimes. But now my husband is catching on. I try to explain my daughter needs to spend time with us as a family without outside influences, and she needs to bond with her mother without being confused. He says I am being selfish. I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. He says that is is unfair to my daughter, and I explained yes it is but he is making it a thousand times worse by not ripping off the band aid. \n\nI have worked so hard to get my family back, meanwhile my husband will not even give me an inch. It's frustrating that I am always made out to be the bad guy when all I want is to fix things.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679645512, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120dkop/aita_for_keeping_my_daughter_away_from_my_sister/", "score": 6957, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should be thanking your sil for providing loving and affection to your daughter over the years where you were more concerned with making yourself feel good with substances rather than caring for your child. Taking that away from her only hurts her more, and she will hurt you back in return.

At one point he was living with my daughter and his brother for almost two years and we nearly got divorced. My daughter bonded very strongly to his brother's wife. \n\nCovid opened my eyes and my husband and I have healed a lot and I am repairing my relationship with him and my daughter. I attend sobriety groups and parenting classes. I understand these things take time. However he continously brings my daughter to visit his brother and her wife. If you ask my daughter she'll say her favorite person is her aunt. My daughter can't help this but my sister in law certainly can. She is always calling my daughter \"my baby\", taking her on outings, etc. She will FaceTime my husband just to speak to my daughter. She seems to not want to relinquish the place she took in my daughter's life. \n\nA few weeks ago I took my daughter to get her ears pierced for her birthday. This was supposed to be a special moment for us, it was the same birthday my mom took me. But instead my daughter started panicking uncontrollably and wanting my sister in law. She didn't want to do if without my sister in law there. At this point I decided to put my foot down. I have been trying to decrease the visits and the FaceTimes. But now my husband is catching on. I try to explain my daughter needs to spend time with us as a family without outside influences, and she needs to bond with her mother without being confused. He says I am being selfish. I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. He says that is is unfair to my daughter, and I explained yes it is but he is making it a thousand times worse by not ripping off the band aid. \n\nI have worked so hard to get my family back, meanwhile my husband will not even give me an inch. It's frustrating that I am always made out to be the bad guy when all I want is to fix things.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Now, you're trying to make up for it, but you're forcing a situation where your daughter will feel abandoned by your SIL - someone who is very important to her. You will end up making your daughter live through the trauma of abandonment AGAIN. \n\nYou need to realise that your SIL taking care of your daughter when you couldn't is a good thing. It's a good thing your daughter was well taken care of and loved while you couldn't do that for her. It's a good thing that your baby loves her, because that means that she was with someone who was good to her.\n\nYou are absolutely right to feel hurt by this, but you're ultimately going to destroy a lot of things including your baby's trust in the world and your relationship to her, if you continue this route. \n\nTalk to a counselor. Talk to your husband. Talk to your SIL. But do not force a child away from a person that this child feels incredibly close to. \n\nYou need to work on your relationship to your baby SEPARATE from your baby's loving and healthy relationship to her aunt. It's a good thing she has that relationship.

It's okay that you feel hurt by the fact that your baby is so close to your SIL. It's okay that it breaks your heart when she cries for her and not you. But that's, frankly, not your child's problem. That's something YOU need to work on. \n\nYour child didn't choose this. She didn't choose to grow up with her aunt instead of her mum.

It's understandable,  but it's really not a good thing for your daughter.  \n\nSee this as a benefit, she has more trusted people to go to when she needs to, many people wish that family would be closer to their kids, and don't have that benefit.  Your SIL is a \"supplimental\" caregiver who was a primary for a while, and it takes time for kids to adjust.  There are people who also have no prior issues, and their aunt/uncle/grandma/grandpa are the favorite person for a child.  This is not a slight to you, but a good thing for your child.\n\nAgain, it feels like a slight because of the past and the things you're working through.  Be honest with yourself about your feelings, but don't further harm your relationship with your daughter by taking away one of the important people in her life she has learned that she could rely upon.  It is an unfortunate byproduct of her not being able to rely on you for a time, and that sucks, but you need to realize that this is something that came about because of your own actions, and it will take your actions to repair. \n\nIf you succeed in driving a wedge, your daughter could one day have abandonment issues, not understanding why the important people in her life disappear, or worse, she could know you drove this to happen and she may end up resenting you and cause the relationship between the two of you to get worse over time, and I'm sure you don't want that.\n\nYTA if you follow through with this course of action.   And I understand that you feel your husband is making decisions without you or that he is disregarding your concerns, but at this point in time, you're also earning his trust back.  None of this comes overnight, not saying you expect it to, but it's probably going to be a longer road to travel than you are expecting, and you need to exercise patience with those who feel wronged by your absence and substance abuse.\n\nTry not to take all this as punishment. It isn't.  It's work.  It's hard.  And you need to exercise patience with yourself most of all because all im reading in your post is \"wits end\" kind of thinking.  This will do you no good in repairing what you lost.  You may not ever get back the things you lost, but you can get to an even better place, but only if you're willing to do what's right for others first.  What was a selfish string of actions is what got you into this situation in the first place.

However, you shouldn't interfere in the relationships your daughter formed with other relatives whilst you were not around.

Now you have decided to clean up your act, you want to sever the stable relationships your daughter formed and relied on because you are jealous. \n\nBy cutting ties with your SIL you will damage your daughter more than you have already. Shame on you and well done to your husband for refusing to do so.", "Yes, YTA big time. You can't make your way into your daughter's heart by destroying the loving and caring bond she developed with someone else.

Her aunt loving your daughter doesn't take away from your relationship with her.  She can love her aunt and you at the same time.\n\nYou made bad choices in your life.

I promise you that forcing your SIL out of your daughter's life will only make her latch onto her more than before.

You need to give your family time to get better.", "YTA.\n\nFirst off her aunt is family, and while I respect that you had your own struggles, your daughter is young and 2 years is a significant part of her life so it is natural that she bonded with her aunt. It is also natural that your SIL bonded with her as she lived with her and your husband, and presumably helped care for your daughter. And it's natural that an aunt and a niece who love each others and share a bond want to keep that bond alive by Facetiming, seeing each others etc.\n\nI'm going to be honest, it just sounds like you are envious of the relationship your SIL developed with your daughter. To put it bluntly, it's not their fault you could not build a relationship with your daughter. It's your fault.\n\nIn trying to rebuild a relationship with your own daughter you should absolutely not try to cut her off other people such as her aunt. If in trying to rebuild your relationship with your daughter, you try to break other people's (family members, no less) relationship with her, I can assure you your daughter will resent you for it. This is toxic and counterproductive.", "OP this is going to be hard, but you need to embrace your SIL and be happy that she stepped up when she did because the safe landing spot she provided for your child is the biggest reason your daughter is well-adjusted.

Don\u2019t let your envy ruin this child. \n\nSeparating your daughter from SIL is going to have the **opposite** effect you think it will.

You want to become her favorite person? Then be her favorite person, starting with not removing love from her life.

You lost years of precious time with your daughter. And while I think it's amazing that you're taking control of your life again and working on yourself you don't get to have everything the way you want it. You have years to prove to both your husband and daughter that you take your disease seriously and truly want to change. Whether you like it or not - you were not there with your daughter at a crucial part of her life because you were selfish and chose substance over her. Your SIL was there for her. You don't get to come in now that you've worked on yourself a bit and pretend those bonding years your daughter had with SIL didn't happen. It sucks for sure but you are nowhere near getting to dictate how your daughter feels. You are still fairly new and have many years of trying to heal the emptiness you yourself caused. In time, if you keep up your sobriety then your daughter may start to come around where she trusts you but that's not going to happen fast. You trying to force her to feel for you more than someone who was a constant is pretty disgusting.

You don\u2019t get to come in and play happy family now because it is convenient for you. And you sure as shit don\u2019t get to push out the woman who has been a mother figure to your child when you weren\u2019t able to. Instead of being grateful for the fact that your little girl had a woman in her life to be there for, you resent it. And how dare you just gloss over that sobriety part like it isn\u2019t a major piece to this fucking story. You haven\u2019t learned a damn thing and if you don\u2019t want to lose your husband and daughter you really need to start doing the work. You aren\u2019t the victim here so stop acting like it. Where the hell is your coach? What about therapy. Because you obviously are nowhere near where you need to be to consider trying to work as a family unit. You\u2019re still too selfish and you are creating a scenario in which relapse is very possible. Because your little girl is not ready to see you the way you want her to. She doesn\u2019t trust you. And she has good reason not to. So instead of trying to prove yourself you are trying to cut out the one woman in her life she feels she can trust? Nope! \n\nYou\u2019re husband will leave you if you continue down this path. You won\u2019t get custody because of your past. You will most likely end up with supervised visitation and when she is old enough, if you keep this up, she will decide to cut you out completely. \n\nOP I\u2019m not trying to be mean. I\u2019ve seen this a lot. The addict wants so badly for everything to be how they want it once in recovery that they end up setting impossible expectations on themselves and their families. They sabotage themselves for it. Recovery is so hard. And all you can see is how hard every single day is for you. That you feel you have earned your place back because of how hard it is. But it hasn\u2019t. It has earned you a foot in the door. You now have to earn the trust of your family back while still working on your recovery. Appreciate the woman who was there for you child when you weren\u2019t. Involved her. Befriend her. She gave you a gift by stepping up when you couldn\u2019t. Show your daughter you can put her needs and feelings first. It may hurt you, but you caused this. So it is you who needs to shoulder the consequences.", "YTA.

It is selfish to want to repair your relationship with your daughter at the expense of what is best for her.\n\nWhat is best for her is for you to not decrease her time with her aunt.\n\nYou can still attempt to repair the relationship through spending time with your daughter, even if that\u2019s not one-on-one time with her or as much time as you want. You need to slowly build up trust.\n\nBut you need to accept that it may never be fully repaired, and that the best way to guarantee it won\u2019t be repaired is decreasing her time with her aunt. Your daughter will resent you forever.", "Ma'am please listen to all these comments. Just based on your responses to others as well as your verbiage throughout, you are not fully accepting that you (and possibly your husband) are responsible for this entire situation. Your daughter found someone she trusts. It's not you, yet. Deal with that. Repairing this relationship comes at her pace, not yours. If you don't clean your act up soon, you risk damaging it permanently.", "YTA. You were an absent parent and someone stepped in to support your daughter, not to replace you as her mother. You need to put your own feelings aside for the sake of your child, or you have learned nothing", "YTA. Your SIL stepped up and gave your daughter a loving, positive maternal role model when you were unable to do so. It's great that you're now in a position to step up and take your place as your daughter's mother, but that doesn't just undo the years of attachment and bonding she has with your SIL. I understand it must be hurtful to see how close they are, but attempting to sever that connection is purely for your own sake and not at all considering what's best for your daughter and her happiness. Carrying on this path is just going to drive a wedge between you and your daughter, your husband and your SIL, and your jealousy and resentment risk ruining the chance you have of ever building a strong relationship with your daughter.\n\nOne more thing to consider. To you, the first four years of your daughter's life may not feel like a long time. What are four years to an adult, right? But to your daughter, even if it's been a couple of years since things settled you need to understand that that period of unrest took up more than half of your daughter's life. It was much longer and more important to her than it was to you.\n\nThe best thing to do now is to show her all the love and support you can, while also allowing her continued access to the support system she's familiar with. You can still build up that relationship with her, you just need to keep being patient. Don't act out of frustration and try to cut her off from people she loves so that she's forced to turn to you by default.", "YTA.\nNo matter what, you are still mom. It is not unusual for kids ro be close to other people. I had my favorite aunt when growing up. When my child was 9 months old, one of my sisters moved away. When she returned to visit, he was angry at her for leaving. Your child will also feel abandoned, if suddenly not allowed to be around their aunt. One of my little cousins, who I babysat, wanted to he attached to me at all times. Didn't make me mom, I was just someone who the little kid liked to be around.", "I am in your husband\u2019s position. My STBX husband is the addict. Please keep an open mind and let me share things from my perspective, as it may help you understand. \n\nMy husband went to rehab when my daughter was 6months old. Our life was a living hell before he went in. She would scream from the time that he got home at 5:30 to the time she went to bed at night. He would drunkenly stumble into the room all night long, waking her and I up with his drunken ramblings, and attempts to pick fights while I was asleep. My STBX husband going to rehab was the first time in my daughter\u2019s whole life that there was peace in our home. She- a tiny baby- showed signs of severe anxiety. It took about 6 months for it to calm down. However, she is still hyper-attached to me. She is very distrustful of most strangers. She sleeps very poorly. She is too little to express herself, but I\u2019m bringing her to a child psychologist to address these issues with play based therapy. \n\nMy daughter lived through six months of hell. Your daughter lived through four years. As much as it hurts to hear it, you are the source of her trauma. You are the woman who made her life hard, who made her daddy cry, and abandoned her. It might take years of selflessness, hard work, and kindness on your part to get her to trust you. By contrast, your SIL was the calm, loving, maternal figure your daughter craved. Your SIL, by default, became her safe place. She lived with this woman, and was cared for by her, for half her life. Removing that from her will only re-awaken the trauma and abandonment, which will, in turn, set back her progress with you. \n\nPlease. Empathize with your little girl.", "YTA. \n\nYou have to earn your place back. \n\nYour daughter doesn\u2019t trust you. She trusts SIL. It doesn\u2019t sound like SIL is undermining you; rather she is being a safe person for your daughter. You should be grateful AF for this. A kid can never have too many people love them.", "Ooooof. Unfortunately you're the type of parent who sends their kids to my office then blames therapy for turning their kids against them because they get the tools to tell you how they feel, instead of your own behaviour.\n\nYTA\n\nAllow your daughter to keep her safe people, and maybe get some therapy yourself.", "The short  answer is yes, YTA.  That said, I see many ways that you can fix this but it includes some hard truths that you need to accept.  First let me say congratulations on getting sober, taking parenting classes and going to meetings.  Those are all great steps, but they are first steps.  You can\u2019t just walk back in to your old life and expect it to be perfect. You did some damage on the way out the first time and re-entry means that trust and love are no longer unconditional.  You have to earn those things back from your partner and your child.  Your child loves and trusts your SIL and \u201cripping off the bandaid\u201d will only cause a bigger wound between you and your daughter.   One relationship you might want to consider investing and repairing is with your SIL.  If that\u2019s the trusted adult, then find out why.  There are reasons you became an alcoholic and while you explore those 12 steps, you need new people and you need a role model for you on what a healthy loving relationship looks like.  Spend the time getting to really know and appreciate your BIL and SIL, thank them for stepping in when you couldn\u2019t, make those amends first, then spend time as a family with them.  In time, your daughter will see you trying, but you can\u2019t force it.  Once the relationship with a child is broken, it takes a mountain to gain it back.  It can\u2019t be won with \u201cthings\u201d and \u201coutings\u201d\u2026it has to be won by just being there.  You could have really turned the ear piercing moment into a win by saying, \u201cI see you are scared, this might not be the right time for you. We\u2019ll do it another time when you are ready and we can all (meaning SIL there too) be there to support you\u201d.", "YTA and it's frightening that you can't see that.\nThere's obviously a past history there between you your husband and young daughter. She finally finds someone who makes her feel safe and whole and now you try to take that away from her as well?\n\nI understand that you want to work on your relationship, and does someone in recovery you deserve that second chance (maybe, I don't have the full scoop) but regardless you cannot take away something from your daughter that is so vitally important to her. \nGrow up and stop damaging your child with poor decisions!", ">I don't see how it's selfish to want to repair my relationship with my child. \n\nIt's not.  BUT it's damn selfish the way you're attempting to go about it.  You were essentially absent from HALF of your daughter's life (if I'm reading that correctly) and now you want to fit everything into your little box of how a \"perfect\" family operates.  I think it's great that you went to therapy and are trying to move forward in a more positive direction.  Sobriety and parenting classes are not a finish line.  You don't just \"check the boxes\" and move on to the next thing and get the prize of \"perfection\" at the end.  \n\nYour daughter has a bonded relationship with your SIL.  You are ABSOLUTELY the AH to attempt to sabotage that.  You would be well advised to take a bite of humble pie and have a heart-felt conversation with HER on parenting your daughter.  Thanking her for the enormous role she has played in your daughter's life would be a good place to start.  It's only human to be jealous of their relationship, I get it...but that was your own doing and you don't get to decide it's over just because you took some classes and feel like you deserve your family back.  It's her family, too.  You should be infinitely grateful to this woman for loving your child as her own during your dark days.\n\nYTA.  You are the outsider to this whole situation and you've decided you're just going to march in and take over and tell everyone how to operate.  No, ma'am.

It sounds like your sister in law was there for your daughter during a time when you were not, and the result is a strong bond that you are jealous over. Try to put your daughter first here- damaging that bond would hurt her only to help YOU feel better. That is selfish, your husband is right. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong to end up in a situation where she looked for another woman to bond with, and she isn\u2019t doing anything wrong by still having that bond even as she learns to make space for you, too. Don\u2019t punish her by taking that bond and sense of stability and live away just for the sake of your own feelings about it. You made choices and have to navigate the results of those choices.", "YTA. \n\nFirst of all OP, I applaud your hard work and dedication to sobriety and to healing your family. Don\u2019t stop that. \n\nHOWEVER. You need to understand that your daughter having a close relationship with her aunt DOES NOT MAKE YOUR RELATIONSHIP ANY LESS. You were absent and struggling and in that time your daughter made an important, healthy familial bond. Demanding that bond be broken so you can make yourself feel more important is just as bad as you staying absent from her life. \n\nStop focusing on a relationship that is not yours, genuinely doesn\u2019t affect you besides make you jealous (which is YOUR problem that you need to work through), and that helped your daughter feel loved and supported in your absence; and start focusing on creating a new bond ALONGSIDE her existing bonds. Find a way to fit into their lives and stop trying to uproot their stability for the sake of your own comfort and satisfaction. \n\nYour husband is 100% right. You are being incredibly selfish and jealous, and I\u2019d go so far as to say your actions in trying to isolate your daughter from her family are hateful.", "YTA - I know this might be hard for you to understand but you don't just walk away from a child who loves you.

It always baffles me how ignorant people are of the consequences of harming children, emotionally or otherwise. It will take a very long time to heal the damage you did to YOUR CHILD. You have no say in how long it takes. The relationship may never be what you want it to be\u2014and you need to be prepared for that, and accept that you\u2019re responsible.

You do not get to disappear for two years and come back like everything is fine.

Ask your husband how you can better support him as the primary parent- because that\u2019s what he is instead of trying to insert yourself where you haven\u2019t been for two years. Two years is a long time and you have come back to life that has moved on without you. You need to accept that instead of expecting everyone to meet you where you are like you never left. If you keep trying to force yourself into a role you no longer fit you were only going to build resentment and your husband and your child. \n\nIt\u2019s OK to be jealous of the relationship so your daughter has developed in your absence but you do not get to remove those relationships from her life her limit them just because you\u2019re jealous. That jealousy is the consequence of your own actions. If you were truly remorseful for what you\u2019ve put your family through you would want what was best for them instead of what makes you feel good.

In short, I had a case with CPS because it just ended up being much harder for me to transition into a sober life and my daughter was in foster care for almost two years. \n\nWe were blessed with the best foster family. I literally could not have picked a better group of people. My was daughter was two at the time. I worked very hard and not only did I never loose my rights, I got my daughter back.

The first time I heard it it took far more self control then I would like to admit to keep myself from crying.

YTA for making all this about you, but reading your post made me sad on your behalf, too. You seem to be struggling, and very lonely.

Spend time with your husband, with friends, with support groups where you meet people who face the same problems. You need to be emotional stable, otherwise you will suck the happiness out of those you are meant to support. Find things that make you happy, then start to do things with your daughter that make her happy. Cook and eat things you like and which do you good, then find out what are your daughters favorite meals. Find a hobby you like, then attend your daughters games and shows. Spend your free time in a way you like, and as soon as you feel happy with yourself, spend time with your daughter. Parenting is to watch your children grow, to give them a caring environment, to have fun with them mostly the way they want to and to support them in every possible way. You need an immense amount of strength to be like that. So take good care of yourself, to be a strong and happy person, otherwise your relation to your daughter will stay upside down. The moment you realise what a favor your SIL is doing you by being there for your daughter is the moment you see your role as a parent the right way.

So speaking from personal experience you do not get to decide how your daughter handles/copes with your addiction issues and absence in her life.

I would say the same here may have affected OP. It's possible the addiction has altered OPs mental capability to understand and their awareness of the situation. This knowledge is only more reason for OP to take accountability by getting therapy and retrain their brain.", "I love piercings, have my nose and upper parts of my ears decked out...(considered eyebrows but I want to go into teaching internationally, my nose I can hide at need because it's a septum)\n\nWhen I was little in the 90s, my lobes were pierced with a gun. Well, I have tiny lobes already, but these holes never closed and fucked up my lobes to the point I can't wear anything in them for longer than 2 hours. Can't get it repierced because the old holes won't close up, can't get piercings next to them because my lobes are so small. \n\nAnd that's not even covering the horrible infection I had, in addition to learning I had a nickel allergy at age 4. Piercing guns are the worst thing, and they're generally handled by a teenager with 30 minutes of training and not a professional in a setting where you're an apprentice for at least 6-12 months. (The shop I go to I like his high standards of teaching, and he gives me great discounts for letting his apprentices practice on me.)", "Yes I was so pissed because my step daughter's mother took her to the crappy shop in the mall on two different occasions ( 1st time she got them pierced my step kiddo was 4 and she came back from her mother's with them super infected bc mom wouldn't help her clean them, and got mad when we let her take them out so her ears could heal). \n\nI have an okay relationship with bio mom so I had asked if the 3 of us could go to a real shop together and I'd pay, which she agreed to and seemed super happy about doing. She took step kiddo back to the mall by herself that week to get them redone. \ud83d\ude44 Funnily enough my first holes in my ears were done in the same way and 25 years later, those are the only piercing I have that are extremely sensitive to metals and get easily irritated.\n\n-edited typos", "I always read it as Starbucks and wonder what coffee has to do with anything.", "This is lovely.\n\nMy step kid used to call me mom on accident when she was little but I knew it really hurt her bio mom's feelings so I gently explained to step kiddo that I LOVE being her bonus mom, but we don't want to hurt her actual mom's feelings. It still happens once in a while, and if people assume I'm her mother out in the world neither of us corrects them because for all intents and purposes I'm one of 2 mothers she has.", "Every time I walk by a claires in the I get a bit mad... \n\nI am so happy I did my cartilage and belly button at real shops. My bottom 2 lobes were guns. They are uneven and can't truly close, but do a bit in the center so I still have to pop it through a bit. I just don't wear them anymore.", "I'd sell every single thing I owned for 20 minutes with my grandfather again. He was the best man on the planet.", "that's sweet. why bother correcting people anyway. If you love her and she loves you then just let it ride.", "Absolutely. I was pretty firm about it when it first started to happen but I have a few close friends who grew up with step parents and they explained pretty well to me that sometimes it's also taxing for kids to explain oh no this is my step parent, or it can feel like the step parent wants to correct other adults, \"oh no this isn't MY child\", which can be hurtful.\n\nI love my step child and I tell her she's \"my kid\" all the time, just like my nieces and nephews and best friend's children are \"my kids\" because they're the kids in my community who I love no matter what!", "Just wanted to jump in and say that I\u2019m a 34yo woman and if my own mother had been given this kind of advice and taken it to heart, she would know where I live and have my phone number right now.", "That means jail doesn't it? Like, the parenting classes sounds like something that would be court ordered.", "I think the daughter is only 4 or 5 years old based on the way she wrote her post.", "I hear the same stories so often it makes me wonder if being an asshole is part of the disease. The drinking itself didn't bother me, except that it made me sad she spent days drunk and couldn't keep a job. It was the lying and stealing and manipulating that kept me away from her. And it continued even until her last day.", "Then even more so as to why she's scared. To a kid that young anything is scary. Yes she'd want her mom but dang she can't be comfortable with an aunt? I was comfortable with mostly my cousins at that age and like a few uncles and aunts(mom has a big family). She's being ridiculous.", "I mean I don\u2019t know your mom, but tell her to just not take it so personally. Kids have the people they like more and that changes multiple times though their lives. My grandma on my dads side (gma Kathy) used to play \u2018grandma Millies house\u2019 (grandma on moms side) with me. I only saw my grandma Millie every couple months whereas we lived right down the road from grandma Kathy.  All i wanted to do was be served pickles on a fancy plate and water from teacups, like gma millie did, and she always did this with me and pretended she was at gma millies eating pickles and drinking \u2018fancy\u2019 water with me.  And ever since i can remember Gma Kathy is my favorite. Even though all i ever wanted was to be at gma Millies.", "Depends on child\u2019s personality. My mom pushed (in honestly a good first grandma way) and my daughter rejected her. It was too much for my daughter. She turned out to be an introvert who hates attention. She bonded with MIL who was opposite and didn\u2019t have that same \u201chappy spoil you\u201d demeanor.", "Boundaries are very important. Talk with your husband to make sure you agree so he doesn\u2019t let his mom do something without thinking just because that\u2019s his mom. Make sure that if they have keys to your house that they know not to just come over when they feel like it if they know you\u2019re home. Now my mom would go and clean my sister\u2019s house if she was at work and have a meal waiting \nfor them when my sister got home but not every day and she always knew when my sister was at work. If someone was home then she didn\u2019t stop by.", "Fortunately my hubby and I are on the same page, and for better or worse it's my mom who is the problem. They've never come to our house uninvited or when no one is home unless we asked them to, but I'll be sure to keep enforcing once we have kids.", "My parents never cared about who was the favorite. We were a large family and had so many people running around that a favorite person was the one who was playing with them at the moment or gave them the bite they wanted from their plate. With the oldest, they plonked him in the middle of the table and turned him in a circle for a new person to play with. It\u2019s still big but everyone now has had at least one kid.", "My mom has a \"grandchild\". It was a complicated situation with my brother, a hookup, and a lot of drugs. The mom got clean, my brother didn't. Turns out the baby wasn't even my brother's, which we all knew was a possibility. But the mom stayed with my mom while she got clean, went through the pregnancy, and raised the baby. He's almost 2 now, and my mom is as much of a parent as his mom. She did finally move into her own apartment, but he still sees my mom multiple times a week, and they are both a part of our family. It would be absolutely devastating to both him and my mom if she was cut off one day. \n\nChildren can never have too much love, only too little.", "Dislike? You sound incredible and so strong and your kid is lucky to have you.", "Holy crap, I somehow skipped over that sentence the first read.  The audacity of that statement!   \n\nOP, just because you have decided to put in some bare minimum effort now, does not mean that you get to erase your past, you are the bad guy and really, you aren't actually trying to fix things for your daughter, you're only trying to fix them for yourself.", ">You don\u2019t win your daughter\u2019s trust by stripping away everything that makes her feel safe.\n\nOP really thinks the way to \"repair\" their relationship is at her child's expense.\n\nOP, YTA. I get that it must be hard to see the close relationship that your daughter has with her aunt, but that is the situation that was created.  You cannot rip that away from your daughter. If you do, not only will it be detrimental to your daughter, it will also not do much in the way of helping your relationship with her.  \n\nYou cannot force closeness with her; instead, you need to build back up her trust.  And, guess what, SIL can help you with this if you would stop seeing her as an adversary, and start seeing her an an ally.", "Trying to get help, but didn't bother to seek therapy, which she needs more than anything", ">You could have shared the moment and face timed the aunt if your priority is your daughter. You could have talked to the aunt and asked for advice how to gain the trust if your priority is your daughter.\n\nI thought of another thing along these lines why not OP, daughter and aunt/sister-in-law all go on a girly outing together?", ">Ripping off the bandaid\n\nRight!  That wording made me just cringe!  Who thinks that way when dealing with a child processing trauma.", "Sadly, I imagine it's more \"when\" she starts using again, because OP does not sound like someone who is really focusing on bettering themselves.  I have a feeling the only reason she's \"attending sobriety groups and parenting classes\" is because it was a stipulation from her husband.  \n\nTo me was the telling word of \"attend\", vs. any active words that would imply OP is making an actual effort outside of showing up and sitting in the back row so she can check the class off her to-do list.", "I think that's why some form of \"repentance\" is used with almost all recovery programs, religious or not. Seeking forgiveness with really admitting what you did and how it hurt people, and accepting the outcome even when not what you would want. OP clearly hasn't done that", "yea speaking as a recovering addict, part of recovery has to be accepting responsibility, and OP needs to accept that the consequences of her past behavior is that her kid trusts someone more trustworthy. The response isnt to further add to the kid's trauma, it's to accept that the best way to make amends and be a better Mom is to support that relationship, to honor it, to be thankful for it. \n\nAddiction recovery can include a lot of shame over the past and processing it, and you gotta just accept that and grow TF up. Addicts are people who spent years running from their feelings and their pain, and we have to learn how to fuckin Adult in a fully emotionally healthy way. OP needs to do that now, by putting her daughter first as her own person, not there to make the Mom feel good.", "Depending on how long you have been using, you can also be an emotional mess for quite a while after you quit using. I didn't feel like my brain had mostly sorted itself out until at least a year of not drinking.\n\nWhat you're talking about is a common pitfall for newly sober people. I was warned repeatedly that being sober now doesn't magically undo years of damage, but it's easy to expect it to.", "My mom was similar. She moved 8 hours away and would make comments about me and my MIL (boyfriends mom but same thing). My MIL and I have never been buddy buddy but I have spent a lot of time with her since she lives 4 houses down from me. My mom started to make comments then but was making them frequently after I had my daughters. Of course my kids loved being with my MIL. They saw her ALL the time and rarely saw my mom. My mom finally moved back up here and guess what? They love both of their grandmas.", "Thank you! I'm so sorry for you about your nephew. Crazy parents.", "This is one of the worst things I\u2019ve ever read on this sub. OP is willing to cause her daughter actual pain and she thinks it will somehow heal her relationship with her. This is absolutely mind bogglingly fucked", "YES. OP, this is what we want to see in 6 months: An updated post from you, that will likely be featured in BestOfRedditorUpdates, where you say \"Six months ago I got some VERY tough love from this community. I'll confess it hurt to read it and I didn't want to accept that I was the problem. But honestly they really sunk in and I realized that I actually would be doing damage to my daughter and our relationship continuing this way, and was clearly making things worse. I realized that my sister in law can be a great ally and my daughter was so lucky to have so many people that loved her. I talked with my sister-in-law a bit about doing things with my daughter together, so she could get love from all angles, and could rebuild her trust in me by seeing me and my sister-in-law together caring for her. It was hard, but clearly my daughter is very much coming around AND she still has a fantastic aunt that loves her. It was win-win.\"\n\nPLEASE be THAT person.", "It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean jail.", "I'd bet that at some point in the past, it *did* work. Probably even more than once. And then you learned not to trust it because it will likely happen again.", "I came to say this!", "My family has been trying to help my aunt with her addictions since she was a teenager. Tried to be there, love her, help her get therapy. A few years ago she moved in with my grandma (we called her Nana) at her place in Tennessee-US. They moved to Florida-US soon after that when my grandpa passed (we called him Papa) and recently, towards the end of the year last year, my Nana passed. When we got to Florida for the funeral (my immediately family and I live in Colorado-US) we found out soon after that my aunt had been taking thousands of dollars from my Nana every month (and my Nana was living off of retirement and wasn't receiving much) and minutes after my aunt had found my Nana had passed away in her bed, she sent all of the rest of my Nana's money to her own bank account. We also found out she was still purchasing drugs.\n\nWe could forgive a lot, and we tried to be there for her throughout her life. But that was the line.\n\nI loved my Nana very much. And knowing my aunt was using her, manipulating her, stealing from her... It breaks my heart.", "Haha I thought it was an actual quote for the first half because it sounded so much like her actual words", "My cousins recently had to go through this. Their dad got married a little over a year after their mom died (of a years long battle with cancer, might I add) and it was heartbreaking to watch them pretend to be happy. It\u2019s an awful situation to be put in, especially when you\u2019re so young and have no say or control", "Probably \u201cThis is all your fault for letting your brother\u2019s stupid wife get her hooks into MY daughter!\u201d", "I recommend therapy a lot so I'm not taking shots at anyone else who does, but a lot of the people who need it the most think of it as an attendance pass/fail. It's more like having a personal trainer. It's hard fucking work and your therapist is there to guide you, but they can't do the work for you.\n\nBased on my experience with an addict mom, OP could also be very sincerely deluded into thinking if she checks the boxes and looks like a good mom then she will be a good mom.", "Addiction IS mental health. It is a disease. I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s right in what she\u2019s doing now, but she messed up too.", "My daughter has always been close to my ex husband's sister and I'm grateful she has somebody she can count on when she visits during the summer (we live about 1,000 miles apart). Now she stays with her aunt everytime she visits and it's such a relief I don't have to worry about her.", "Same with my mom. I think she was probably a clinical narcissist before the drinking ever started, so this may not apply to your situation but it's held pretty true in my experience.\n\nI think people who can't be alone with their thoughts will never be happy. Some numb/distract themselves with substances, work, gambling, other people, religion, diet, etc. But if you push them, they'll lie and manipulate and do whatever they have to do to protect that coping mechanism. They can't be honest with others because they can't be honest with themselves. The only people who recover are the ones who are willing to do the work to figure out why they're unhappy/scared and address it.\n\nThat isn't to discourage anyone dealing with mental illness or insecurities. If you're working on it and choose to tolerate that discomfort rather than reaching for a bottle, you're headed in the right direction."]}
