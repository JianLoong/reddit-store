The entitlement of some people astounds me.", "Well, I'm glad I saw a comment that you had made it clear in advance that you were getting a whole pizza to eat because you were starvin' Marvin.  NTA.  People assume too much.  But it was also not good that the server assumed you were sharing either.  Mixed signals can give people the wrong impression.  Good luck!", "NTA for wanting to eat the whole pizza you paid for yourself by yourself.\n\nBut YTA because you lack social awareness (maybe on purpose? were you feeling petty?) as you didn\u2019t mention it up front in a group setting\u2026.when you saw the server start to set four plates, rather than wait for the plates to be set down and someone to reach for a slice, you should have spoken up, kinda laughed it off and told the server\u2026.ohhhhh just one plate\u2026this is just what I ordered for me\u2026I know hahaha it\u2019s absurd but I\u2019m starving. That\u2019s the cue for others that it\u2019s not shared and instead of humiliating someone else who was just given a plate so assumed it\u2019s shared, you stopped it in its tracks, and everyone can have a laugh with you, instead of you making everyone feel grossly uncomfortable after the misunderstanding. At that point I would have given her a piece. \n\nHaving said that I personally would never assume if I didn\u2019t pitch in with $$$, like the girl, it was shared unless someone specifically said so, but people in group settings with a plate set in front of them may assume differently, I suppose.", "NTA \n\nYour pizza and if they wanted a slice. Get up and place an order for themselves.", "Nta, but it doesn't sound like your intent was overly clear from the get go. \"Hey just so everyone knows I'm hungry enough to eat a village and will be ordering myself a full pizza, please don't judge me haha\" or something to that affect.\n\nNo, you don't HAVE to share, and no one should have assumed that it was to share, but it's not completely off the wall for someone to think it was table pizza.", "NTA- Did all the people talking about \"social conventions\" miss that the girl just started to reach at the pizza? That's straight up rude.  Were I in a group setting and someone had ordered a pizza, if they didn't ask for input before ordering \"Hey, I'm going to get a whole pizza. I was thinking pepperoni. Does anyone want to go in on it with me?\", I'd make the assumption it was just for them.\nTypically if someone feels like sharing food they'll offer.", "NTA, it's fine if she'd asked for a slice, but to just reach over and try to take it is really rude.", "NTA! when I'm out with friends and they order an appetizer, I don't assume it's for the table to share- although it usually is, but I don't even assume the right to ask. I just mind my own business unless/until they let tell us it's for everyone. \n\nAnd sometimes, I will order some large meal so I can take half home for lunch the next day, or because I'm just super hungry.

We live in a society where not every social rule is the \"right\" way", "When you order in such a group dynamic, it is usually assumed to be shared. Would have been better if you had announced that you were famished and needed an entire pizza, and asked others if they were going to order anything else. \n\n18 inch pizza by yourself. You must've been very hungry indeed.", "The easiest thing would have been to say you're ordering a pizza and you were going to eat the entire thing because you hadn't eaten and was anyone else hungry so you could order two. Having failed to do that then when they tried to eat your pizza, say you hadn't eaten and we'll order another one for everyone else.\n\nWere you AITA, nope. If they were that bothered they could order their one.", "NAH - You weren't eating a whole pizza out of spite but out of hunger. I too have ordered large quantities of food for myself in similar situations, but I will make clear by mentioning that I'm starving and ready for a whole pizza (or whatever it is), that I can't wait to eat a whole x or whatever, just to make clear that it is personal food. But nobody else was an AH for asking for a slice or assuming it would be a group thing, since pizzas by the nature are often a group food. Friend is right that you could have been polite, but you also didn't need to give it.", "ESH I wouldn't say that you were toxic, but it was a little bit unreasonable. An 18-inch pizza is absolutely huge, and even if you're starving, half of it would have been more than enough to get you through the evening.

This seems like it kinda blew up when you were just trying to eat.", "How would you feel is you were out with friends, one friend orders a whole pie, and refuses to share? Yes, technically you paid for it, and are therefore entitled to eat it all.

You are not hungry anymore.\n\nBut that's not what happened.\n\nYou were with a group of friends.  Ordered a large pizza delivered to a table of four.  The restaurant, as well as your group, was all correct in assuming that the pizza was for the group of friends to share.  \n\nIn that scenario, if you don't want to share...order the double cheeseburger plate instead.", "NTA but its etiquette to share pizza. You wanna preface your pizza with an announcement its just for you", "You hadn't eaten in 24 hours, not 24 days.  YTA, share the fucking pizza or just order another one for crissakes.", "nta. especially with the note, everyone paid separately. So why doesn't that person just order a slice of pizza or did she just expect to mooch off you? IF that other person thought it selfish, why didn't he just order a pizza and share with the other person? Easy to share with OTHER people's food.\n\nAlso, you had no need to finish it just to prove a point either...that's why there are doggie bags :P", "NTA especially as people could buy by slice.  The real ah is the server giving multiple plates which led to the assumption and your friend for accusing you eating out of spite. Judging someones appetite, amount they want to eat, etc is a social no no and a dick move on yourvfriends  part. The girl is an ah for not double checking, especially as people were ordering seperate. Perhaps to not humilate her, you should have let her have a slice but said the rest is yours and to buy a seperate slice if needed, which would be a signal to everyone else. Maybe you should have said to the server the plates arent needed, do you want them back? So not elegsnt, but not ah", "unless someone tells me they bought this for the table I don't assume I can have their food.", "Normally I would say NTA since it's your food and you paid for it.  But given the setting you were in, you're kind of TA.  Social conventions IMO would dictate that generally a whole pizza is meant to be shared, especially an 18 inch pizza. Its kind of like having a party with a big pitcher of drink in the middle then when someone goes for it saying \"that's just for me\".", "Or to take home for that matter.  \n\nThe guy wanting you to share with the table, I don\u2019t see him offering anybody any food.

The same way people who spend all their money make fun of or demand loans of savers and get their sendthrift friends to help", "Lol what? No. People should learn to ask and offer to pay. \n\nYou're saying never get pizza, fries, sushi, onion rings, hot pot, samosas etc.etc.etc.\n\nLike, just order soup, salad or burgers in social situations forever.", "An easier alternative to avoid such misunderstandings would be to find new friends that aren't freeloaders", ">When you order in such a group dynamic, it is usually assumed to be shared.\n\nThis is silly. I would never assume someone was ordering for everyone unless they specifically said it was okay to dig in.", "Unless they chipped in for the pizza, they shouldn't assume.

Assuming something not paid for is fair game is rude.\n\nNTA", "Those last two sentences are a social faux pas.", ">There's no good reason you couldn't spare one slice.\n\nWith four drunk people I wouldn't be surprised if everyone else tried to dig in after OP gave one person a slice. Saying yes to one person and no to the next would be difficult. \n\nFriend could had offered to pitch in if she wanted a slice.

Why are the others entitled to his food?", "I was actually still hungry after finishing the pizza", ">The restaurant, as well as your group, was all correct in assuming that the pizza was for the group of friends to share. \n\nI would never assume that at a place where slices are available.

Is that cool with everyone? Is anyone else going to get more food?\u201d The problem wasn\u2019t that you ordered a pizza for yourself. The problem was that you were in a group and didn\u2019t make it clear the pizza was just for you, for your dinner.

She should have asked you before just grabbing a slice though.", "NTA but if you'd sent all bar one of the plates back it'd have been more obvious it was for you only. But fuck those freeloaders!", "That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous, a 18\u201d cheese pizza is 4000 calories, and I\u2019m sure you had toppings.", "I'd be more inclined to think the pie was for the whole table, BECAUSE slices were available.", "That's more difficult.  But you could have ordered a slice or two at a time, and repeat until satisfied.   Nobody shares a slice, or two slices.  Yeah, it likely would have cost more, compared to buying the whole pie at once.  But it would have avoided the awkward situation where you had a large pizza that everyone (naturally) assumed was for the group....", "Everyone ordered for themselves at the counter, so I feel like the assumption is that if you didn't order anything, you weren't planning to eat", "Why should anyone have to explain what they are ordering? If you order a stein of beer that's two pints, do people assume you'll pour them a half? No. Why is it not the same for food?", "I didn't, and they were thin slices", "Lmao what? You wouldn't even be bothered to ask 'oooh, is this for everyone?'\n\nI would never assume that. Wild.", "That seems like a dumb reason to spend an extra 15 dollars", "But they all just ordered slices, which is clearly just for one person. You ordered a whole pizza which was put down in the middle of the table with extra plates. It\u2019s a reasonable assumption that it was for everyone to share, and the girl probably felt humiliated when you told her to put a slice back. I do think she should have checked with you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA, just giving you some social pointers for next time so your friends don\u2019t feel embarrassed or pissed at you. Make it really clear before the pizza arrives that you haven\u2019t had dinner, the pizza is your dinner, it\u2019s just for you, and ask if anyone else going to order food so that you are not the only one eating.", "Social convention.", "Either way NTA but haha that\u2019s a lot of food", "Social convention says you discuss sharing a pizza and deciding on toppings. NOT assuming that any pizza that shows up is fair game.", "Is this the same social convention which can dismiss abuse comments as \"woke\",  excuse abuses historically \"because it was a different time\" and suggest some people \"shouldn't be allowed in countries?\"", "Exactly.

I cannot imagine a situation where there wasnt already several shared things going or someone had said help yourself befpre id help myself to food without double checking. Its called manners.", "I do think the girl should have asked. But in this situation it was a reasonable assumption that it was to share. Everyone else who wanted to pizza ordered it by the slice.

I\u2019m disengaging, I have no interest in debating with you about shit that has nothing to do with this post.", "So many people think this way. I struggled with this when I was early 20s going for Chinese food and I was the only vegetarian.

It isn't dominos or pizza pizza. Its expensive and I would assume someone would either eat the entire pizza or take their leftovers home. OP said it was 30 bucks. \n\nA lot of the Ethiopian places in my area cater to both drinking and food service. If someone ordered a platter while you were just having drinks would you dig in? \n\nOr if you were having drinks at a sushi place and a couple people ordered single rolls, would you assume the guy that ordered three or four was sharing?", "And it would've been just a miscommunication if no other person of the group had ordered INDIVIDUAL slices. If that girl wanted pizza, she should've ordered one as well.", "Was a simple question, you mentioned social convention, I mentioned the trappings that go with it. Take your ball and go home if you can't stomach the premier League", "Thats terrible. People do assume. But man, split bills the worst. As a light eater, ive noticed its usually the biggest eater in a group who suggests towards the end of a meal \"hey wouldnt it be easier if we just split\" or chooses a non individual pay establishment.
