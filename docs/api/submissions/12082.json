At that point I would have given her a piece. \n\nHaving said that I personally would never assume if I didn\u2019t pitch in with $$$, like the girl, it was shared unless someone specifically said so, but people in group settings with a plate set in front of them may assume differently, I suppose.", "NTA \n\nYour pizza and if they wanted a slice.

JOEY DORSNT SHARE FOOD.", "Dont be greedy?! Said some guy who wnats what is not his!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreed is wanting what is not yours.", "NTA. If that person wanted food, they can use their own money and order some themselves. They are not entitled to help themselves on your dime.", "Info: why didn\u2019t she order her own pizza?", "NTA. Would it have been nice to let her have one slice? Sure. But she was not in any way entitled to a slice and it is not toxic for you to order the amount of food you want to eat and then eat it. You didn't eat it out of spite, you intended to eat it before anyone else said anything about it. They probably could have bought their own whole pizzas for the price of one drink. \n\nYou definitely shouldn't have to do anything to defend against food thieves, but here's some unsolicited advice: if you're ever ordering pizza or something in a group again and it's just for you, you can tell the server \"just one plate, please.\" That's a signal to everyone at the table that it's not to share, hopefully avoiding this, or at least triggering the conversation before anyone has done anything rude and embarrassed themselves. The opposite works too, clarifying to the server that it's to share so bring a few plates.", "Soft YTA, I will get downvoted for this and you are getting a lot of N T A because you are technically in the right. But that doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t still socially inappropriate and rude. There\u2019s better ways to handle these kind of situations.", "NTA if there\u2019s a next time simply reach for their drink and say cheers mate. \n\nWhen they protest simply go \u2018oh I thought keeping our purchases to ourselves were greedy?\u2019", "Perfect response. What is it with this gross sense of self-entitlement and then the guilt tripping?", "Also, it is never one slice. Op you would\u2019ve been the one left with one slice. well done on holding your ground.", " I ordered for me\u2026I know hahaha it\u2019s absurd but I\u2019m starving.", "Frankly it would be weirder to tell everyone unprompted that the pizza is just for you and you aren't intending to share.  The default expectation whenever going out should be that whatever someone orders and pays for is just for themselves, unless they say they're getting it for the table. It's fine to ask if you can have food that someone else ordered but the fact that this girl just dove in for a slice without saying a single word...", "OPs friend also said they could have shared a slice with someone who didn\u2019t order food\nLike why didn\u2019t they order food after the fact then? What\u2019s stopping them from getting an appy?", "NTA, you paid for it. Everyone was buying their own food. There's nothing toxic about what you did.", "Same, I was out last night and hadn't noticed the sides section of the menu, my friend ordered first and asked for prawn crackers. I asked 'are you a pig for prawn crackers or are they for sharing?' \n\nTurns out we're all pigs for prawn crackers and got through a big portion each - all it took was for me to ask for my own portion.", "Even if they were cool to share a slice with me, I'd at least include an offer to throw them a couple bucks in the same breath that I'm asking if I can have a slice of theirs. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch and my mom raised me to both be self-reliant and not presume others' intentions.", "Eh. I've done it in my younger years.", "Or just drop those people, and you'll get the same results, like i can't imagine calling someone toxic for not sharing their food in a non life or death situation. Nobody else helped pay, and she didn't ask, just went for it. that's rude af.", "Social convention doesnt dictate that when people are prepaying for their own meals. A party is not a restraunt and certainly not one where you can buy by slice if you are hungry and some people already are doing so. And social convention says if the buyer doesnt make it clear its to share, you ask before assuming. So not quite the same thing.", "I mean I'm not OP but I'd feel like I should go buy my own damn pizza.", "I\u2019m tired of etiquette.", ">ked, you could have been a little more gracious. Maybe announce when ordering, how you were so hungry, that you plan on eating a whole pizza all by your self.\n\nDo you also announce that you intend to drink the whole beer?", "OP is getting a sign that they have some not so good friends. NTA as required. OP if you see this? Believe them when they tell you that you somehow owe them food when everyone is paying for themselves. This would have tripped my PTSD and I have nuked a few friendships because of that entitlement to my food. \n\nWhat I learned? People who respect you will take no and then be concerned you did not feed yourself and if possible offer to get you more food. Then harass you with love over the rest of time to make sure you ate. Turns out this is awesome and helped me with going from constantly acting on an eating disorder to now over 12 years without. I stopped counting but it was 2008 last time I actually acted on it. Triggers still happen but if I am not able to make it by myself I call or text someone and go \"I need help with the brain weasels. Here is what I did. Here is what triggered me.\"\n\nPlease note I am not assuming an eating disorder as I also had jobs where food was hard and poverty is my life long companion where it was just too expensive. Other reasons exist but this is my experience with bad friends contrasted with chosen family level people. Literally just ate some ice cream and am pondering the difference between just casually having a snack and the before times. I hope whatever your food barriers are get remedied and that you find some friends who support you eating.", "But there are certain foods like pizza that most people consider \u201cshareable\u201c like nachos, sushi or a combo appetizer platter. If you want to order these and not share it would be best to speak up before ordering and say \u201chey, I haven\u2019t eaten anything today and I\u2019m planning on eating the entire thing myself so if anyone wants some I think we should order another platter/pizza/etc.\u201d.   \n\n\nThis makes it un-weird and gets the point across before grubby hands start grabbing.", "This is completely context dependent. If you order a steak or a plate of pasta  at a restaurant it\u2019s safe to assume it\u2019s just for you. If you order nachos, pizza, wings, bar snacks etc at a bar it is a reasonable expectation that this is sharing food.", "The presence of multiple still signals to the other members of the group that this is for sharing. Easier solution would've been to send them back - that clearly signals that the pizza is just for you. Because typically, given it's way more calories than any person actually needs in a day, the *assumption* with a pizza that large is that you're open to sharing. If you're not, you need to be super clear that you're not.", "Even if someone placed down a pizza meant to feed 4-5 adults at a table of friends? At a bar?\n\nI would still *ask* if I could have a slice, but I would still have assumed it was for the table prior to asking.", "Yeah, like things like this never stay just one person, if you agree to give person A \"just one slice\" person B will ask for some and suddenly youre the dick because \"but you gave person A some\" and eventually youre out thirty bucks with no food  because it spirals and everyone just starts taking it and youll still get called a dick when you try to set a limit.", "If it was keg", "I *might* be open to letting someone have a piece of pizza, but keep your chopsticks away from my sushi!", "If I order sushi and anyone else touches it without asking, they're getting cut", "Absolutely. Let's stop pretending that social norms don't include sharing. \n\nSure they don't have to share, but realistically it SEEMS like OP was doing a nice thing and it's awkward to realize that's not the case. Pizzas take up the *center* of the table and are a commonly shared food.", "I mean, but even with that kind of stuff, it's entitled and weird to just assume that it's shareable when that hasn't been made clear prior. Like, if I see a pizza that one individual has ordered, my first instinct isn't to just grab a slice, it's to ask, \"Hey, could I steal a slice?\" And if they're then like, \"No, I'm starving so this is all for me,\" I just go, \"Oh, okay, no problem\" and order my own damn slice. \n\nThe same goes for stuff like nachos. I fucking love nachos, but I still ask before just snatching a chip. And I'd be livid if I ordered nachos all for myself bcause I was starving and people just felt entitled to start grabbing at them because, \"Nachos are a shareable thing!\"", "Yep! My friends and acquaintances used to be regulars at a restaurant that made massive nacho platters. No one ever assumed they were in on the plate without asking.\n\nSuper simple to ask 'hey, are we getting our own or sharing tonight?'", "What kind of a grotesque pizza is able to feed 5 adults? It'd need to be the size of a tractor wheel.", "That's the stupidest thing I've read today.", "NTA. I've been in the same position as you, as the person who ordered the food and as the one that hasn't, and unless whomever order it says \"it's for everyone, please take some food too\", no one ever even considers to grab any. People eat entire pizzas all the time, and if that girl wanted a slice she should've bought one, as some of the others did. Why didn't they offer her their slice?", "I'm assuming you meant thin crust.", "OP is not socially awkward nor unaware. He simply has a couple of idiot friends."]}
