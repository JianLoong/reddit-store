Its not on you.", "1. He\u2019s using you and you\u2019re allowing it\n2.  Buy your own bra to try.  Gross violation to take yours.  Be he was gonna pit it out without washing it\n\nNTA. He needs to enter a n assistance home if he can\u2019t be on his own", "Girl don't set yourself on fire to keep him warm. You are his maid service, financial provider, and total support system. The way he treats you in your own home shows how much he values you in return. He's selfish, NTA.", "Taiwanese here, absolutely NTA!!!!!", "NTA. I don\u2019t share underwear with anyone not my mom not my female relatives. No one. Exploring your sexuality doesn\u2019t mean you take other peoples things without permission. Could\u2019ve gone to primark and grabbed some cheap cute knickers to dress in if he felt so inclined", "NTA look who cares if he wants to do drag, he needs to buy his own damn clothes. I would be tossing the underwear away because nothing kills sexy like imagining your sibling in them!", "Well, today I learned something from the universal condemnation in the responses here. The idea that borrowing someone's underwear is exponentially worse than all his other faults, and grounds for immediate ejection, startled me. I'm not defending his actions, but my response to my sibling (whatever gender) trying on my underwear would be \"I get that you're experimenting, but go buy your own\" rather than \"I have been defiled! Burn everything and run for the hills!\"I think you should evict him out regardless (his lifestyle and your anger about him would be reason enough), so NTA in that respect, but all the \"I'd kick out my sister for borrowing my bra!\" responses did surprise me.", "Whoever is saying you are phobic is a moron. Stop caring about morons. And get rid of your sicko brother before he rapes and murders you.", "Now is a great time for some love and understanding. Teach him (them?) that the issue isn\u2019t the clothes they wore but took your clothes without asking (especially underwear) and that going through your things without permission.", "YTA for not asking him to leave after you saw his room full of garbage! He doesn't even clean his own room? Quit letting yourself be treated badly! He's not your problem! You have your own life and no matter what you're parents try to say you DO NOT need to deal with this! He's using you and apparently now your clothes! We're they sticky? This is disturbing! Grow up and kick him out!", "NTA \nYou are not obligated to enable his fetish. He crossed a line. You have a right to be creeped out. He doesn\u2019t have a right to call you a bigot.", "Cultural reasons are not good reasons if they lead to bad things", "NTA\n\nWhy would anyone want to live with a cross dressing slob with mental disabilities who doesn\u2019t even respect your privacy?", "NAH. I understand your being upset, because you don\u2019t know what he was using them for. If to get off, that\u2019s really creepy. If it\u2019s because he wants to wear women\u2019s underwear for any other reason (he wants to do drag, or he feels his nature is all or part woman, etc), he can go to Walmart and buy his own. \n\nI get that you don\u2019t have a lot of extra bandwidth right now, as a doctor in training. So just ask him to stay out of your stuff (put a lock on your bedroom door if you need to). Make sure you communicate that the ick factor was him using YOUR underwear. For all the other reasons he might want to put on women\u2019s underwear, show him acceptance but tell him to get his own stuff. \n\nIf you can, show him the empathy and compassion you would show to a patient who is struggling with these issues.", "Fake, this is just reversal of another recent one except sis mad instead of sis feel bad", "While I don't particularly agree with kicking him out unless it's a last resort since this is a cultural obligation, you're NTA. Your feelings are valid.\n\nPerhaps it would help if they had their own clothes to experiment in?\n\nI know that money is an issue, but if they're willing to keep to their own wardrobe if they have options of their own, this can possibly be fixed.\n\nAlso, a lock on your bedroom door when you're not home to keep down the temptation to explore.", "As someone who has diagnosed mental disabilities, I can sympathize with him for how he acts. Sure he didn\u2019t ask you, but with how unsure he is and depending on his diagnosis, he won\u2019t be open with things until confronted about them. Kicking him out because of this could be the very thing that sets him off and makes him going even deeper into his mental issues. \n\nTalking to him would have been way better. It\u2019s all about how you talk to someone, especially someone in his situation. If someone comes up to me and says, \u201chey can we talk about something?\u201d And then continues to have a conversation about the issue, things will go a lot smoother. If someone did what you did, it would send me over the edge and I\u2019d be so much worse than when I\u2019d have loved in. \n\nBecause of how the situation was handled and knowing more about how mental illness goes, you are the asshole. For both you and your brothers sake, I hope you can work things out", "You went into his room when he wasn't home? Did he say that was ok?", "You are doing everything for him, he has no reason to change or get better, he is having his cake and eating it too. Sitting and gaming allll day isn\u2019t likely to help his health either.", "NTA, he can go be himself with his own underwear.", "NTA, you should never use someone elses underwear ever, for any reason. That doesn't make you a bigot. Also, he claims he tried them on, he could have been something else with them, and claimed to be trying them on to cover it up. You are also letting him live rent free in your home, and he doesn't even clean up his own room.", "If you have to allow him to stay get locks for your bedroom door. NTA and I'm so sorry you have to deal with this", "NTA- Yeah I would chuck a female sibling out for that combination of events, so you're cool to boot yours whatever their gender.", "NTA, You are NOT obligated to look after him, he is a grown man. Stick to your guns, and give him a formal eviction or he could take you to small claim court. Brother wearing sisters undies is just .....", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you were pretty fed up with him being a slob and your underwear and bra being on him were thr last (weird as hell) straw. And before anyone jumps me about his cross dressing, idc about that. It's weird no matter if it's her brother or sister trying them on.I", "Get a lock for your bedroom door and don't leave the keys accessible. You are not responsible for him or anyone else unless you have children. You are not wrong. NTA", "NTA, sounds like this was the final straw. Not contributing, leaving his room in a whole mess, not trying to find a job and now he's trying on your under things. Nope, he's got to go. Culture aside, this is about respect and he wasn't respecting you or your home. Put a lock on your door and enforce the move out date.", "Put a lock on your door. \n\n<shudder>", "NTA\n\nIf he is mentally there to go into your room and get your room and get your expensive underwear to try on as well as spend all day playing video games then he is mentally there to get some help for his issues and attempt to find a part-time job to help pay bills and rent. \n\nHe is using his mental health issues to take advantage of you and the circumstances.", "Tell him to pay you for your cloths and offer to take him shopping for Cheeper stuff. Also he needs to start contributing to the household. I understand you\u2019re grossed out but try to emphasize that he is struggling with his self image and had no other way of getting these types of clothes in his mind. NAH I\u2019m my opinion", "Ick. He was hiding them in his dirty clothes, he knows it was wrong. NTA", "NTA.\n\nHis sexuality doesn't give him free access to your underwear. And frankly, if he is capable of getting out of bed every day then he is capable of cleaning his own damn room.", "well that is a huge breach in the trust department. NTA what ever you do going forward", "NTA", "NTA But you live in America and certainly don't have to take care of him.", "NTA. There's nothing wrong with your brother (sister? sibling?) wearing whatever kind of clothes they feel suit them, but taking the liberty of wearing your clothes without your permission is very inappropriate. They definitely sound like they need help they're not getting, but that doesn't mean that behaving in a way that brings harm to you is acceptable.", "Obviously NTA. Also have you considered, the sexuality/wearing is a coverup for something even more devious?\n\nCan\u2019t believe you had to add that edit. Such fucking idiots on here sometimes.", "ESH.\n\nYou\u2019re the AH cuz you freaked out on your brother for being trans, he sucks for stealing you underwear cuz that weird.\n\nYou should have some compassion for this person you claim to love. Toss the underwear and take your bro back in and just set some boundaries, maybe help him buy his own.\n\nUnless, you know, the real problem is that he\u2019s trans and not that he took your underwear.", "Honestly I think he lying. Just the whole vibe being described makes me think he is lying.", "100% doesn't matter gender. My sister and I would occasionally steal a shirt or sweater but even though we wore the same size we would never have taken the others undergarments. I think I asked to borrow a strapless bra once but obviously I ASKED and didn't just take it. Undergarments are kind of a private thing. The only time I've shared underwear with my sister it was because her suitcase got lost on a flight. I let her have some undies until the airline got it back to us, but it also wasn't fancy pricey stuff. It was cheap cotton stuff that comes in the pack of 10 or whatever. I would absolutely never want to try on my sister's fancy underwear and I wouldn't want her trying on mine.", "Yeah irrespective of gender, it\u2019s just really fucking weird and gross to wear your sibling\u2019s undergarments. Ew.", "> *NTA your brother is a creepy pervert. You're doing the right thing*.\n\nYour brother is a creepy, disrespectful, lazy pervert.  He didn't need to involve you and your stuff in his kink - he's too lazy and disrespectful to cover his tracks.  He had no qualms about stealing your stuff, since he already is enjoying your home and your food.    \n\nHe might be hiding a vicious temper, OP, and so far you perhaps haven't really crossed him.  Being made to leave might be extremely threatening to him.\n\nBefore you say anything else to him about leaving, you might be wise to speak with some domestic violence experts or psychs (I know that his own can't say anything) on the best way to get him out.\n\nI'm probably an alarmist, but I hope that you will take care to protect yourself and any pets you have if he becomes agitated.\n\nNTA", "I mean he is my brother, idk", "No.\n\nSomeone's mental illness isn't a reason to allow them to shit all over your boundaries and disrespect you.  Ever.\n\nIf a person in your life is so far gone you can't safely confront them about unacceptable behavior, especially if you are giving them free room and board, they need to be even farther gone.  I'd suggest inpatient somewhere.\n\nNTA, OP.

That is unhygienic, for one thing and a major breech of trust and privacy for another. \n\nIt's bad enough he is using you as a free live in hotel with maid service but to then turn around and do something so violating. \n\nIt doesn't matter if he is experimenting with his sexuality, he can buy his own online, every site has a size chart with measurements, so all he needs is a tape measure, internet access and a way to pay online. Instead he chose to steal your (not that it matters, *expensive*) lingerie and violate your personal space.\n\nI'm sorry for being blunt but, it sounds like you need to hear it.", "Please stop with the cultural norms and live for yourself.
