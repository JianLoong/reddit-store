Still, I don\u2019t ask him to split rent or bills so he can focus on healing, and hopefully get back on his feet.\n\nHe spends a substantial amount of time playing video games & chatting online. It\u2019s not really my business, so while I\u2019m disappointed, it\u2019s his choice and life, I can only do so much.\n\nOn my off day, I was home doing some cleaning and laundries. He went to see his psychiatrist, so I took this opportunity to clean his room because he gets annoyed when I do it while he games/chat. Sticky half empty soda cups everywhere, clothes on the ground, and bin overstuffed with trash as usual. Anyways.\n\nWhen I was rolling his socks, and putting them in the storage bin, I saw a bra & pair of panties buried in there. I was shocked & didn\u2019t really know what to think at first sight. Barring what\u2019s obviously disturbing, those were expensive lingerie sets I bought from VS like ~$50, and like I said I\u2019m not exactly making bank. \n\nWhen he came back, I asked him how my bra & panties are in his storage bin. (I admit,I may have been a little aggressive with language) \n\nHe told me he was trying them on, and forgot to put them back. I had an absolute meltdown, and told him he\u2019s now on his own, and to make plans to move out by next year. \n\nHe cried, kept reiterating it\u2019s not a big deal, and said I\u2019m an a$$ hat for lacking sympathy and a bigot. Later he told me he struggles with his sexuality (never spoke to me about this btw), and said I\u2019m making him feel bad about him being himself (or herself). \n\nIdk how I feel. Maybe I need a week or two, but I just feel so angry, confused, and disgusted. I look at my wardrobe and I want to throw everything away. He said he didn\u2019t wear anything else, but idk if I can ever trust him.\n\nEdit: We are Taiwanese Americans, and for cultural reasons I\u2019m obligated to take care of him for now, his lifestyle is not the point. I\u2019m not phobic, and I\u2019m not disgusted by his sexuality, but for wearing my undies & bra (one cos I\u2019m his sister and it\u2019s just weird, two he didn\u2019t even ask me)", "created_utc": 1696371614, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16z5g0u/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_move_out_for/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah, he shouldn't have borrowed your stuff without asking, but experimenting is normal.\n\nYou sound very much like a homophobe and you're definitely judging him. Have you ever considered that possibly part of your brother's mental illness may, in part, be because of him struggling with his sexuality? Whether you throw him out or not is totally up to you, but let's hope it's not because you now find him disgusting.\n\nEDIT: Now that I've seen the updated information, I understand a little more about where the anger is directed.
