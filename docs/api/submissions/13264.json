I was cool with it, I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d go far, so I met him and dropped off the kids, he told me it was a surprise and he wasn\u2019t telling anyone where they were going so the trip didn\u2019t get ruined. Last night my children FaceTime me, and I notice that Mickey is all over the hotel walls, after I got off the phone I texted my former MIL and asked if they were at Disney, she said yes. They\u2019re 3 and I\u2019ve been planning their first Disney trip for this Christmas, so I am obviously upset, not to mention nobody told me my children would be 3 states away. I called my ex today (he did not go on the trip) and he told me, he told his dad not to tell me and to lie to me because I\u2019d just be a bitch about it. AITA for being hurt and upset about the whole thing? Truthfully I would have been okay if someone had just asked me, but between being lied to and being blindsided I\u2019m pissed. Not to mention, I missed a big first experience with them.

I'm not sure why you are so upset. Also, they kind of did you a favor.  Something like Disney is so overwhelming the first time for anyone.

This is a very solid reason to petition the court to change the custody agreement.
