Sure, but it also sounds like your grandma has a history of emotional manipulation that doesn't start with the loss of her husband.", "I agree with this! I really think you need to be honest with her, especially since she has a habit of making these kinds of remarks based on your comment about \"being able to be proud\". Like, make her understand that you sympathise with her situation, that you understand that grieving can affect your judgement and that you want to be there for her, but that it's unacceptable to speak like that. It's so common to enable that kind of behavior due to wanting to take the high road and excusing people because of their situation, but it's never that black or white. You can be supportive and kind, while also expressing boundaries. Understanding her situation doesn't remove the consequences of her lashing out on the people who are closest to her, she is responsible for her actions and needs to be made aware when she's being hurtful.", "I think honestly ESH here.  She is vulnerable and overreacted, but you\u2019re overreacting too.", "I appreciate your reply a lot. I struggled with just excusing her behavior because of the situation since I am not down to excuse it 10 more times. \nYou put it in the best way possible.

Several days in the space of a month of four-hour car trips to emotionally support a grieving relative on top of managing your own work and life... it's a lot. There's no 'should have been', it sounds like you needed a break from it. That's not wrong when many other people were present to offer support and celebrate the day.\n\nYou are not wrong to feel hurt that someone you have tried hard to support is choosing to emphasise the one time you didn't show up. You are not wrong for feeling like you want further space from her. You do not seem like someone who would make a decision to act on those feelings lightly - certainly most people wouldn't act on such feelings when it comes to a loved elder member of the family - but I hope you understand it's completely understandable that you have had them. And I hope you also understand that it's okay to be thinking about your own emotional wellbeing too and making realistic decisions about how much you can be there for someone regardless of their old age or state of grief. I hope your grandma is able to come to appreciate that you do care and you are trying your best.", "NTA. You don't need to \"just get over it\", but understand that grief is involved here.

Get her a card or whatever. But respect is something you earn (so my dad said). If you do call her, be sure to let her know that. Maybe not that blunt, but let her know that just because she's \"old\" and that she is your grandmother (or not?) Doesn't mean she can say things like that even if she is greiving, which you fully understand.\nI've worked with the elderly. They sometimes need to be put back in their spot. I know it sounds rude, and disrespectful, but it's true", "YTA kind of but it does seem like she is asking a lot of you. It seems reasonable to me since you were just there to just send her a text. Her response is too much but she probably *didnt* mean it and it seems reasonable to cut her some slack since she just lost her husband. For me all of this would hinge on my relationship with her otherwise. If she has been there for you your whole life, supporting you, nurturing you and loving you, I\u2019d be eager to make amends and give her every benefit of the doubt. If she is just a mean old woman who gets off on making her family do what she wants them to and you feel like you just deal with her to placate your mom, don\u2019t worry about it. In fact, if that *is* the case it might be a great tim to draw boundaries with her. But I mean, regardless, you\u2019re an adult and you don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to.", "Hm I genuenly don't know what to vote. For one, you don't deserve that comment from her, on the other hand, I understand she may be lashing out bc its an extremely difficult birthday, since either the first without your grandpa", "NTA, but people say stupid things when they are hurt/upset/being giant drama queens. \n\nIf you are otherwise reasonably fond of your grandmother, I'd forget she said it, and treat her as normal next time you see her.", "NTA\n\nFine.  You are no longer her grandson.  No need for to visit her at all if you don't want to.\n\nOnce things are said, you can apologize for them but that doesn't mean they just disappear.", "NTA this is a tough one for me. What she said was too much and I feel an overreaction. Grief is no excuse for meanness.

You didn\u2019t do anything wrong by missing her birthday. Would it have been great if you could? Sure, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt and just forgetting about this one. Also apologizing for not being there on her birthday. Thanks for your insight.", "Hope it goes well!", "Probably because this is the first birthday without her husband and how many years?

Well, if 8 times is your maximum amount of time you want to go and see her then maybe you should\u2019ve gone seven times that way you could\u2019ve made her birthday.

When he took breakfast back to her, she was gone.\n\nI received a note from her sister, who told me that my grandma, hearing of the new life to come, had not felt able to face that and let go of her own.  Imagine how that made me feel - I'm responsible for my grandmother's death because I called to tell her I was pregnant.  Eventually I realized that my great aunt hadn't meant to lay blame, she was simply making an observation from her point of view, and perhaps her own grief had not let her realize how it would sound to me. \n\nThat's not as hurtful a comment as your grandmother made, but I'd advise giving her some grace.  She was probably hurt that you didn't come to her birthday when you had made the trip with the family so many other times, and that hurt was on top of the massive hurt of losing her husband.

Please don't lose sleep over this. Leave Gma alone for a while (6 months?) and then check in to see how she's doing. If she's still bitter, then stay away.", "ESH\n\n I will say 2 hours there and back is not that big of a deal and not that long of a drive. I live in a place where if I want to shop anywhere that isn't walmart ..(say a target) I have to drive an hour and if I want to go somewhere nicer.. or to the zoo.. or any museum.. it's 2:30 hours. What we do is we make a day of it so it's worth the time we spend in the car.\n\nYou could have made the drive and how many years did she spend with your grandpa? How many holidays and birthday's. Now she alone.. without him and his companionship. That has to be HUGE on her health and well being. I'd say what she said.. was out of just hurt and anger. You have no idea what kind of a loss she's going through.", "I will say- one of the features of Alzheimer\u2019s is having ZERO filter. They say how they feel and give zero f\u2019s afterwards!", "Yup. Very typical.", "Don't let the drama pass down from get generation to you. She is grieving, which never leaves people at their best. And from the sounds of your comments she can be a difficult personality at the best of times, which this definitely isn't. Chances are she was feeling low and unhappy and needed to latch on to some immediate reason why and your absence was it. Lucky you. (/s)\n\nBest thing to do is apologise next time you see her and sweetly say you were so sad to miss it. Drama-mongers hate it when they don't get the reaction they expect so she might not let it go. Look up 'grey rock'. If you really feel she's getting under your skin it can be a useful technique.\n\nThe thing is though, grandparents are not permanent fixtures in your life. It's for you to decide if you are likely to regret later not spending time with her while you still can. NTA", "Is grandma Italian by any chance? Because she sounds a lot like my friends grandmother.. The woman means well but it's just the harshness that comes from her upbringing that kind of sticks with you. She use to complain when making her costumes that she had no booty and then when she got older she became plus sized and got that booty so her grandma complains and she just tells her.. hey you were the one that wanted me to have a butt.. you got your wish. lol (her grandma is a seamstress)"]}
