It sounds like mom has a habit of disregarding other's opinions. A gift should be something you actually enjoy or use. The second you said you didn't like the ring, that should have been it.

There are many things that could have happened that led her to feeling upset, but none of them are your responsibility. Perhaps she had already bought it. Perhaps she got it in some other way without buying. Maybe she's insecure. You can support her feelings without changing your mind or feeling guilty about it. \n\nTreating you like you're ungrateful is a way to be controlling (even if your mom doesn't realize it).

Hopefully your mom doesn't have a lot of other toxic behavior patterns, but definitely seek help if she does.", "NTA: You told your Mom you did not want the ring, you did so in a respectful way. She chose to ignore. When she gifted it to it became yours and what you did with it was your decision. By selling it, it helps you get ahead. By letting it sit in your closet, it really becomes meaningless.

Selling it so quickly and not even seeing if you would want it later is the most hurtful thing. Your mother probably thought this could be an heirloom, especially if her parents did not have enough money to give her something like jewelry in the past. Rings, bracelets, watches are a physical connection to love ones that can be worn at special events in the future. Your mother probably thought about that, and wanted you to have something to represent her love of you to wear at future life milestones. You did not take her perspective into account at all, and that probably broke her heart.", "Did you really need the money right now? \"Don't look a gift horse on the mouth\", is a saying that also applies to parents, and is a good motto to have if you enjoy getting gifts.

I also understand your reasons for selling. Maybe use a rule of thumb next time? Just for a little peace for a time? Basically it's that you keep the gift for a year because it gives you time to see how you ultimately feel about it but if you don't use it or have need of it for a whole year, you sell or donate it. I use this for all gifts and it's a life saver. Most people are just happy it spent some time with the recipient before being given away or sold.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a sentimental gift.

I'm sure if she had some ideas, then mom would have more catered the style, but she wanted to give jewelry. If you are getting engaged, and you tell the person \"I don't want a diamond ring... I want a tent\" that is just stupid.  No one really wants to give people dishes for their wedding, but it's what you do for that type of event.  So, it's BOTH.\n\nAlso, sapphires are the least expensive gemstone (far cheaper than most camping equipment), so I'm sure the parents are (a) poor and (b) had this planned for a while.

I wouldn't give a gift that I expect someone to like many YEARS from now; I give gifts that I expect a person to like NOW. The former is also strange to me because who knows what someone will like many years from now. Heck even if OP gets into jewelry, years from now she may prefer an entirely different style that what her mom gifted her. It still strikes me as so condescending and paternalistic for OP's mom to presume to know better than her daughter who was very explicit about what she wanted/didn't want, including not getting a gift! \n\nAlso quite the stretch to assume the parents are poor or have planned it a while, there was nothing in the post alluding to that.

Camping gear is none of those things.  They wanted her to have a memento.  No one is entitled to a gift (surprise!), but this is the type of thing I'm sure Mom intended to be an heirloom. It's not knockoff fashion jewelry,\n\nI have like 3 things of my grandmother's... I'm not selling them.

It's this simple.", ">I told my mom she did not have to get me a present if she did not want to\n\nShe wanted to give you a nice piece of jewelry that would last for life! She told you that!  Nothing you said = rich, and international vacations aren't super expensive (destination specific).  College is like $15-50k a year.  An international vacation for 2 is $3k-5k a lot of places.  Again, this is why I said you sound entitled.\n\n> I am in the process of applying for graduate schools to get my master\u2019s degree, and each school has an application fee. That is what I used the money for.\n\nI'm 41 (presumably 20ish years older).  The past 3-5 years has been nonstop deaths of parents of my friends, my aunts and uncles, and both my parents being hospitalized for life-threatening illnesses.  Your mom gave you a precious ring for a reason, and it's the same reason MOST parents choose to give their children nice jewelry for graduation.  Again - this is a COMMON gift.\n\nI guarantee she wanted you to have something that you can keep for life.  Now, you don't have that.", "You are not only making several assumptions with information that we don't have about OP, but you're also being extremely morbid. 55 isn't anywhere close to death.", "OPs mom spent $2000 on the ring. They could have bought plenty of long lasting camping gear that OP would have actually used and created great memories with. Once you give someone a gift, you don't get to say what they do with it because it's no longer yours.

Are you insane?? \n\n  \nYou know what you can keep for life? A Master's Degree! OP should not be forced to take something they hate because it'll make mom feel like a main character.

You dont know OPs financial situation and seeing as the parents didnt want to pay for college OP is well within their rights to sell the ring which was given to them as a gift. \n\nYour making this into a bigger deal than it had to be. It was given as gift it wasnt a family heirloom.", "I didn't get jewelry either, but I worked in jewelry for a while (it's a common gift, but not the only thing people get as a grad gift) and I also know a lot of people who were given precious jewelry as graduation presents e.g. diamond earrings or whatever.  \n\nThat's it. It's like saying that some people do that whole \"paper\" / \"wood\" / \"silver\" thing for anniversaries.  Some people are given precious jewelry or cars for graduation or a sweet 16.    \n\nThis isn't really the kind of thing you turn around and sell the next week, despite if you \"wanted it\" or not.  It's a sentimental \"welcome to adulthood\" present. I get why her mom didn't want to give cash or camping gear, though.  They aren't timeless."]}
