He informed me that somebody I used to be friends with was there and recommended that I say hi. I had reservations as we had fallen out about 7 or 8 years prior and it would be a little awkward but I remembered that I had bumped into him 4 years ago at the store he worked at and things seemed normal and mature and we enquired about what was going on with each other rather casually so I thought what's the harm, let's see how he's doing.\n\nI walked over to him, said hello and then looked around the group he was with. I looked to my left and saw my ex and reacted with surprise. I said \"oh wow, hello\" (probably not the appropriate reaction). There was no malice in what I said, I was just genuinely surprised to see her. The last I'd heard she'd left the country many years ago to work as a chemist in Germany. She proceeded to flip out at me for something I had supposedly said about her after we broke up. She said that I had called her a \"Feminazi b*tch\" (a term I'm pretty sure I never used since it's a rather right wing slur but nonetheless it's what was quoted). I was pretty confused by this and asked her when I said this about her. To which she said 9 years ago. Now don't get me wrong, I didn't handle our breakup in a way in which I would do now that I have grown and matured as an adult. I bad mouthed her quite a bit which I have deeply regretted and been ashamed of as I've grown and reflected on my past behaviour.\n\nThe thing is that the last time I saw her, about 7 years ago, we spoke quite in depth and I apologised for the hurt I'd caused her and my past behaviour knowing that I could not go back and change my behaviour but I could take responsibility. I know that I was a jerk back then but I have been trying my best to grow and never be that person again. \n\nWhen I mentioned how long it had been she said she can't forget because her friend still brings it up all of the time, to which I said that maybe that's a problem with your friend, they should allow you to overcome pain and heartbreak and be supportive rather than dragging it up 10 years later. I guess I'm asking, AITA for emphasising that it's been over a decade and that dwelling on this is only hurting her, we all have made mistakes, I'm not proud of them and I feel terrible that she's still holding it and really sincerely wish for the best for her in the future.", "created_utc": 1667192631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi1cnq/aita_for_suggesting_that_my_ex_should_move_on/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her \"friend\" gets some measure of fulfillment causing her pain, probably a means to help them cope with their own personal problems.", "Kinda torn here to be honest. \n\nOn the one hand, you claim you never said that, although to me that's something you should be 100% sure about, not 'pretty sure' about. Like I don't care how bad my memory is, I can be categorically certain that phrase has never passed my lips. It would say a lot about your past behaviour if you reckon you're unsure. Anyway, if she's genuinely accusing you of something you didn't do, that's an AH point for her, though I can't imagine why she'd be so specific about something that didn't happen. \n\nMoving on. You say you took responsibility for behaviour that you're ashamed of. If you've apologised and taken responsibility for behaviour that you know was bad, why didn't you reflect that in your response to her, by recognising your responsibility for your past behaviour and that it was bad?\n\nDeflecting to 'It was a long time ago' doesn't sound like taking responsibility. Trying to turn it into an attack on her friend doesn't sound like you recognise you were a jerk. If you've been really hurtful to people, you can apologise and change your ways, but there's not a time limit on when they have to stop caring that you were shitty to them. \n\nYour reaction suggests that you expect her to just forget about it already, and that's not necessarily how it works. And yeah, it's not recognising or making amends for hurt you caused. Just because you've decided to be over your past behaviour doesn't mean she has to be, and she can dislike you for it if she wants.\n\nESH I think.", "NTA. It sounds like you did sincerely apologize and take responsibility for your mistakes. You guys were teenagers, she doesn't have to like you but publicly chewing you out warrants the response that you gave.", "What kind of badmouthing?", "I think it depends how awful you were tbh. If you made the breakup traumatic/ scary or her life hell for a long period of time because of what you did, then YTA, but if it was a normal breakup with a few cross words then NTA.", "ESH, she doesn't have to forgive you.  You can't just demand forgiveness no matter how much time has passed.\n\nThat said her reaction was uncalled for.  Her friends also suck if they've been using what you said a decade ago to continue bullying her.", "NTA but neither is she, her friends are though. This is weird to me, the issue was resolved 7 years ago but its coming up now again? Very strange if her friend truly won't drop it I can get her frustration but a decade is a long time and people need to move on, its unhealthy to hold onto hatred for that long even if it is valid. She is under no obligation to like you or have any positive feelings for you after your breakup but it is clear this anger is toxic and only something that will make her more miserable.", "Gentle ESH. it sounds like she responded inappropriately to you after she bumped into you at the bar. Who knows why? Maybe somethings going on in her life right now that churned up the intensity of that time in her life? Maybe she was drunk? Maybe she's never gotten over you! Who knows? \n\nBut since you don't keep in touch and aren't friends? Why school her on what she should be doing? Even if you have a point? Let her friends help her process her bizarro behavior. \n\nYou admit you weren't proud of how you reacted after your break up. Given that, I think it might have been a better move to say, \"yeah, if I said that I'm sorry.\" \n\n...And back away very slowly. \n\nI don't think you did anything unforgivable. But it might be something to think about handling differently next time.\n\nBecause by engaging with her in a negative way you're whipping up more drama and harm between the two of you. For no reason at all.\n\nedit: a few lil mistakes", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like this was dealt with 7 years ago. I have no idea how people hold grudges for so long!", "NTA. Your ex has the problem if she still hasn't moved on.", "YTA\n\nWhen you wrong someone, you never get to tell them when it's time for them to move on and forgive you. That's their call.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Took me a long time to see what she was doing. She'd bring up something stupid from the past, harp on about how upsetting it was for me, and then when I took the bait swoon in and comfort me to make it all better. It was all about her being the hero in the story. Funny thing is, once I ended the friendship, I've never even thought about all that stuff she used to bring up semi-regularly. It was really nothing, you know? But for whatever dumb reason (and I blame myself for this too!) I always fell for her hero routine.\n\nTo anyone who recognizes themselves in this story: Just end the friendship. It won't be easy (my friend kind of stalked me for a while and when something truly horrible happened, tried her emotional vampire routine again) but dammit, you will be a lot happier and in a much better place without someone always trying to make you feel like shit, just so they can try to play the hero who is always there for you.", "I understand not being sure. I have a terrible memory and am never confident in my own recollection. Sometimes even doubting myself when nobody has told me otherwise. Now i am sure I never used the word feminin*zi but thats because its in english and not in my Native tongue.\n\nWell. Pretty sure.\n\nWill i remember i used it in this context 9 years from now? Nope.", "I think it's relevant that OP did not ask for forgiveness or expect it. They just said that it's been long enough and OP already apologized so it's unhealthy to chew them out in front of a group of people ten years later...which is true.", "The ex can feel whatever she wants but when she feels the need to confront op 7 years later over words, then yeah she needs to get the fuck over herself!", "OP didn't tell her to forgive him. Just to not chew him out in public over something that he already apologized for, and happened a long time ago.  It doesn't sound like he expected forgiveness, he just expected not to get publicly chewed out, which is reasonable given their ages. Yelling at someone for what they did in high school is super immature, especially when they already apologized. And it's especially immature to do in public where everyone else was probably made pretty uncomfortable for no good reason. If she was that upset she could have just walked away instead of ruining everybody's experience for zero gain whatsoever.", "Forgiveness was never asked for", "Yeah I'm with you. OP never even asked to be forgiven. Just said it was time to let go. Which, yes after 10 years, it is. Also OP clearly states too that they question the validity of them saying that slur to their ex. I had an ex who told people I emotionally abused him for years. He attempted to m*rder me in my own home. Exs will spin shit however they like when they're riled up.", "OP says - \"I bad mouthed her quite a bit which I have deeply regretted and been ashamed of...\"\n\nDepending on what exactly this means, it could be completely valid that their ex doesn't feel like pretending everything is cool.", "You said you told her to \"move on.\" That's her choice, not yours. You don't get to set the timetable for her moving on. She may never \"move on\" in the sense you want and that's okay.", "Most people bad mouth their ex after breaking up!", "Ah, I guess that was bad wording in the post. I should clarify that I didn't use that phrase when speaking to her", "OP says they're ashamed of what they said so I think this goes beyond the normal and expected.", "Okay, well if I have to parse out what you said you said but didn't actually say and what you actually said, I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nMy point is that she can think whatever she wants about you based on what you admit is past behavior you're ashamed of.  You're not entitled to her forgiveness, moving on, or acting like everything is fine between you two.", "Or perhaps they're just better quality people. It's normal to regret bad mouthing an ex. It's the terrible people that never feel shame for that.\n\nAre you one of those people that feel it's ok to badmouth an ex?", "I think my comments telling OP they're not entitled to forgiveness make it clear that I don't think it's okay. OP feels ashamed of their actions and it seems like it's justified."]}
