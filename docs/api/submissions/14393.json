Your feelings of guilt arise from having a history with your ex and, to speculate a bit, from the imprinted manipulation where you feel like you should have done more. \n\nThat said, you made a perfectly appropriate decision, for what seem like solid reasons.

Whenever people try to force others into maintaining a relationship with someone they have disengaged with (estranged family member, ended friendship, ex partner) I always assume the people forcing the renewed relationship are doing it because they straight up find the person in question intolerable and want so badly to force them onto someone they deem more worthy of the person's unpleasantness. His friends and family rather you deal with a lying asshole than themselves. They wish you'd be their meat shield for his shitty character, despite knowing you are in a new relationship. That shows you something about their respect for you, your partner and your new relationship. Maybe they liked him better when you had some influence over him. Maybe they liked it when they weren't the closest people to him in his life... but that doesn't mean you must resume contact and especially not when he is still demonstrating questionable, objectionable and deceitful behavior. \n\nYour ex is an asshole, your friends are assholes (and you should reconsider these friendships, they're not friends when they push you like this.)", "NTA.", "NTA You owe him nothing.

He called one day, acting despondent, and dropped the phone, and I couldn't use my phone because the line was still open (landlines, pre cellphone). Went to my neighbor's house and called dispatch. I told them I was concerned about him and could they check in him at his office. He was full expecting I'd come running and instead got a rude awakening when they showed up instead. But he never tried it again!", "NTA It sounds like he's just calling you to make you feel sorry for him, and if you're the kind of person that enjoys taking care of people, then people like him will take advantage of that.

I wish you the best of luck with your situation as well.", "He's manipulative which unfortunately means he can manipulate how other people see you. You have no control over that, just as he currently has no control over you. He wants that to change and he's going to use every tactic he can to get what he wants. Including using his injury to turn others against you. Do not engage.\n\nI dated a quadriplegic and went to some support events with him. I remember the wife of a newly injured paraplegic was talking about how he wouldn't let her sleep. Wouldn't let her get help. It was infuriating. The leader was a long time wife of a quad, and she said that people with these kinds of injuries are living in survival mode. Even the best of them are 1000% selfish because of it. So... People who were already selfish? There were a few of those in the community. Absolute poison to be around. \n\nIn other words this injury, however he got it, didn't improve his outlook. It sucks that he's able to turn people against you. (Breaking up with a quad is no fun either let me tell you!) But for the love of God congratulate yourself that you aren't in his orbit. His injury is no reason to put yourself there.", "Nta as soon as you go and see him the manipulation is still working. Good on you for staying away", "NTA and you need to just block all of those people from your past. Protect yourself", "NTA\n\nBeing injured or ill doesn\u2019t mean you can demand people who ended a relationship with you visit.\n\nIt is neither inhumane nor harsh for you to keep the door closed on that relationship.

You have no responsibility to any of these people and it was nice of you to inform them he'd had an accident.", "NTA - send him a teddy bear or something.  He is an Ex - not entitled to more than a nod", "NTA. It is hard for all parties. However, when a relationship is over, it's over.  If a relationship doesn't end in a long term romantic commitment, it's over. Best to move on.  You don't owe anything to an ex.", "He is your ex. For a good reason it seems. Why would he expect your support.\n\nNTA.", "Especially with a fake sob story.", "You are not responsible for his comfort or happiness. Would he be YOUR support system if you lost a limb? Anybody telling you it's your duty to sacrifice your happiness for him is not a friend. Tell them to hold him to the same standards. NTA", "NTA. He's your ex.", "NTA. He was your EX for a reason, AND you were out of town for work. Were you supposed to risk your job for him when he was still lying to you? Yes, it's horrible what happened to his leg, but he only has himself to blame for that. Driving a motorcycle \ud83c\udfcd\ufe0f while drunk is a REALLY bad idea. Something even worse could have happened.", "NTA but could be without telling how he lost his leg", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible or obligated to help him.", "NTA. Dude is your EX.

You have ZERO responsibility to him. Block them all", "Baffled by the notion that when you cut someone out, you have to let them back into your life as soon as something bad happens to them.  NTA!!!

NTA 4 sure.", "NTA. Don't go back into his life. He doesn't sound like a great guy.", "???? it's been a YEAR. It's wild that anyone thought you would go, given the reasons for the breakup. NTA, and it might be time to tell mutual friends that you don't want to talk about your ex anymore and you don't want people talking about you to him, and you'll be leaving conversations as soon as he's brought up. If they can't pick being civil to you over talking up a guy who sounds pretty crappy at best and possibly abusive at worst they're not actually very good friends.", "NTA.  He\u2019s a liar and he\u2019s trouble.  You\u2019re old enough to know what\u2019s best for you and he isn\u2019t it.

Idiot (Him)!", "He\u2019s an ex for several reasons. Go live your life without him in it. Needless to say NTA!", "NTA. First off, he is your EX and had been for over a year after your last breakup; why was he even calling you? Second, you were out of town; there wasn't anything for you to do except the one thing you DID Do, which was call his local friends and let them know. Finally, we circle back around to the first thing - He shouldn't have been calling you with any expectations in the first place - you weren't together, and it sounds like you weren't actually friends.\n\neta - and that's not even getting into the fact that he's a liar.", "NTA, he used his own drunk driving accident and amputation to try and manipulate you into seeing him again. He\u2019s clearly a turd, lmao. You definitely shouldn\u2019t see him again.", "NTA And there you have it. He\u2019s not a great guy, and that\u2019s why you aren\u2019t with him. It\u2019s not like you were his SO at the time of the accident and you dumped him because he lost a limb. THAT would have been reprehensible. You did what you could, it was reasonable under the circumstances, and you have moved on. As for his friends, they probably aren\u2019t as deeply affected by his manipulative nature as you were. They don\u2019t have the perspective or the war stories that you do. I don\u2019t know how to advise you, in part because you weren\u2019t specific about how the \u201csituation has followed [you] over the years.\u201d If they are still making snarky remarks, you need to say something. It needs to be put to rest. Neither you nor anyone else has any cause to remonstrate with you! Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "NTA go live your life.  He is your past not your present or future.", "Lol, he lied about the vehicle, that he wasn't driving, and that he was driving drunk.  As a recovering alcoholic, you never deceive that much.  Better to say you were on the motorcycle and swerved to miss a dog/kid.", "NTA. You owe him nothing, go no contact and move on with your life.\n\n And if you ever see him again, just run away.", "This is so weird but I have a friend who did exactly what you didn\u2019t do (same accident and lost limb). She regrets it. He took her kindness and friendship, even took her willingness to reconsider a romantic relationship and around the time he was able to do most things independently? All the same shit that ended their relationship came right back. It was devastating for her. NTA.", "Someone once told me \"empathy without boundaries is self-harm\". Believe me, i tore myself to shreds trying to be there for someone who was my \"best friend\" before we dated, but continually manipulated me and stomped all over my boundaries while we dated, cheated on me, dumped me, then attempted to pull the \"let's be fwb because I'm really not ready for a relationship\" and since i have shit self esteem and thought he was the love of my life i agreed, and THEN found out he was still sleeping with the other girl and telling her we had broken up and i was just being clingy. \n\nIf the mutual friends think you should have dropped everything and jeopardized your job for this guy, they aren't your friends either. You will be happier if you cut *all* ties, including mutual friends. Speaking from experience."]}
