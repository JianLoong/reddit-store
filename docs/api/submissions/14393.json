It's not something that your ex and your mutual friends should have any part in. Period. \n\nIt's ok to decide that you didn't want to have any part in your ex's rehab. Your feelings of guilt arise from having a history with your ex and, to speculate a bit, from the imprinted manipulation where you feel like you should have done more. \n\nThat said, you made a perfectly appropriate decision, for what seem like solid reasons. You should put this all behind you. Period.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Whenever people try to force others into maintaining a relationship with someone they have disengaged with (estranged family member, ended friendship, ex partner) I always assume the people forcing the renewed relationship are doing it because they straight up find the person in question intolerable and want so badly to force them onto someone they deem more worthy of the person's unpleasantness. His friends and family rather you deal with a lying asshole than themselves. They wish you'd be their meat shield for his shitty character, despite knowing you are in a new relationship. That shows you something about their respect for you, your partner and your new relationship. Maybe they liked him better when you had some influence over him. Maybe they liked it when they weren't the closest people to him in his life... but that doesn't mean you must resume contact and especially not when he is still demonstrating questionable, objectionable and deceitful behavior. \n\nYour ex is an asshole, your friends are assholes (and you should reconsider these friendships, they're not friends when they push you like this.)", "NTA.", "NTA You owe him nothing.

We split up (due to his cheating/gaslighting), but he kept calling, trying to get back with me. He was a law enforcement officer but at the time working a desk job. He called one day, acting despondent, and dropped the phone, and I couldn't use my phone because the line was still open (landlines, pre cellphone). Went to my neighbor's house and called dispatch. I told them I was concerned about him and could they check in him at his office. He was full expecting I'd come running and instead got a rude awakening when they showed up instead. But he never tried it again!", "NTA It sounds like he's just calling you to make you feel sorry for him, and if you're the kind of person that enjoys taking care of people, then people like him will take advantage of that.

Stitches are coming out tomorrow. But my nub is still too swollen for a prosthetic, so in the meantime trying to get used to living w/ a missing Limb sucks.

I think some blocks are in order.", "Thanks again for your kind words. I wish you the best of luck with your situation as well."]}
