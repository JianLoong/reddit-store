We took the train in and out and left the city a bit earlier to get home in time to take care of our dogs. We were in a bit of a rush but were super hungry and stopped for a quick meal at Shake Shack. We found a couple barstool seats and noticed a small shopping bag that had some skin care prodcuts in it, but no ID, wallet, or anything else (I checked). We didn't recognize the brand or store name and it was at the counter before we arrived. \n\nWe were there for about half an hour or so and kept an eye on the bag assuming someone would realize they left it and would come get it, but that didn't happen, so we just took it when we left. Later we sent a pic of the face cream to my brother's partner, who has worked in cosmetics for years. He told us they were super expensive products that totaled to nearly $1000 after taxes (the single face cream retails for like $300 and there were other items in the bag) and scolded us for not turning it in to the cashier. \n\nMy wife feels bad because we hadn't even considered doing that, but I don't feel at all guilty because we didn't steal it from someone, they left it and it had been parked there for at least half an hour, probably longer. It sucks and maybe we should have considered turning it in to the cashier or even looking up and travelling to the store to return it to them and let them sort it out, but that would have taken a long time, we were exhausted, and we were already rushing to get home as it was. We genuinely didn't think of it. \n\nIMO, if you've left behind something like that and didn't immediately retrace your steps to find it, then what happens happens. It sucks, and I don't mean to put down someone accidentially leaving something behind, it happens to all of us,  but no I do not feel bad to be the \"finder.\" Plus I can't help but wonder that any cashier would have been just as likely to keep it, too. Also, what realistically could they have done? It's not like a phone or wallet that could have been traced to the owner, there was no receipt in the bag or anything.

I hope karma bites you in the ass on this one.", "YTA\n\n\"Abandoned\" is not the right word. Don't try to make yourself feel better using language like that. Someone forgot their cosmetics, and you stole them, period. It would have taken very little effort or energy for you to simply leave the stuff with the cashier.\n\nInstead, you took something that was not yours.

That said, karma is a bitch\u2026\n\nEdit to add:  shake shack\u2019s in nyc\u2026especially the one in grand central, Madison square park, theatre district have cameras so if they really needed to see who took the bag, they\u2019d probably be able to easily identify you,", "YTA. You are lacking in ethics. They almost certainly returned looking for their bag and would have recovered their stuff if you had left it. You are opportunistic thieves. Shame.", "YTA, that is stealing in my opinion. Someone with decent morals would give it to the store to hold onto in the hopes they come back. How is that not even something you thought about doing?", "YTA\n\nSo it's okay for you to take skincare products that don't belong to you because you have the motto \"life sucks for you if you forget something\"? \n\nHow do you know if that was what that person was doing was going back for the bag? \n\nI hope you remember about what you said if you lost something of value to you.", "YTA.  You are thieves.", "YTA - Yes this is stealing. What grown person doesn't know if you find something that belongs to someone else in a place of business, you turn it in to an employee?? You make an insane amount of assumptions here. Maybe the person didn't notice the items were missing and showed up for them minutes after you stole them. Regardless you knew damn well they didn't belong to you.", "YTA you did actually steal it. Why would you have taken it? Common sense is give it to the manger of Shake Shack saying hey I think someone left this here.

You did the wrong thing.", "\u201cAbandoned\u201d?   No.  The bag was left behind by a mistake, not abandoned.   This makes you and your wife bigger AHs because you are trying make it seem like this was a deliberate act of the original owners.  No one buys $1k in face cream to \u201cabandon\u201d it.  YTA.  You could have left it with a cashier.", "YTA- You stole.  You're just trying to find justification for doing it.", "YTA and also that's criminal larceny, you're damn lucky that it's under $1000, otherwise you're potentially looking at a felony.", "YTA.  Why not turn it in to the **manager** of the restaurant in case the shopper came back for it?  It might not be a phone, but someone spent their hard earned $$$ on that and isn't getting the $$$ back.  You're a stealer, plain and simple.", "Well in your case I hope the Shake shack doesn\u2019t have cameras to review when the person who forgot their face cream comes looking for it ! YTA", "When we find something that doesn't belong to us, we take it straight back to the cashier/reception.\n\nThe person who left the bag behind is bound to realize it and go back to get it. You don't leave something that expensive behind without looking back.

What a shame.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Seriously? You took something that didn't belong to you. You knew it didn't belong to you. Somehow the fact that you didn't know who it belonged to made it yours? So you live by Finders Keepers. Most of us got over that in childhood.", "YTA.  I feel sorry for those people, who probably will come back hoping some decent person turned it in to lost and found.\n\nYou are a flat-out thief.", "YTA. Someone is definitely not getting into the Good Place with those weak ethics.", "YTA for not turning it in to the cashier. You know that person retracing their steps? They're going to call the store or come back to the store. This was no more abandoned than if you had walked up to the coat rack at a restaurant and grabbed a coat you liked. This was not your bag to take.", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you tell the cashier and let the restaurant hold it until someone came back?\n\nAlso, what woman doesn\u2019t know La Mer? BS", "Yes you are the asshole. If I was the person and accidentally left 1k worth of items I would have hoped on my life a decent person would\u2019ve given it to a cashier, etc. \n\nThe person probably came back after you took it and asked the cashier if anyone had given them an unclaimed bag.\n\nThere is no way that person left essentially 1k and just didn\u2019t go back to look for it", "YTA. I don\u2019t get why you didn\u2019t leave it at the cashier. I always ask the cashier if they saw something I lost", "YTA.\n\nEasy peasy, cut-and-dry: without your *helpful* intervention, the real owner might have their stuff right now. If *nobody* touched it, they absolutely would have it back. Your actions deprived them of their purchases. It's not like you found a five dollar bill in the street. And you're really stretching to make it so you can keep the stuff without feeling like the Bad Guy. Make of that what you will.", "YTA. Turning it into place you were at is the right thing to do and you know that. It is stealing what you did. That person may have headed back to the place and retracing their steps.", "YTA. You are also a thief. What's the matter with you? You say something to your server or to the cashier on the way out. \"That bag has been sitting there for a while. Mind putting it behind the counter for the owner?\" How hard is that? I find it hard to believe it just didn't occur to you. Doesn't matter if the owner came back for it 10 minutes later or 3 hours later. IT. WASN'T. YOURS.", "Yta", "YTA.  You can try to rationalize it, but it is still theft.  You could have turned it in at the Shake Shack, or even checked with the store whose bag it was, but no.  You made excuses to justify theft in your mind by convincing yourself it wasn\u2019t.  You gaslit yourself.", "YTA it\u2019s common sense if you find something like that to give it to the staff where you are. You didn\u2019t have to trek to the company but there is no excuse for not handing it in to shake shack management\n\nYou are a thief\n\nI\u2019ve worked in retail and with lost goods we always kept them behind the counter for when someone came back", "YTA and you\u2019ve just racked up some seriously bad karma. May you never be dependent on the kindness of strangers", "YTA. You just cannot presume that the cashier would have kept it with himself too. If you have found something that is of a certain someone in a public place, you should return it back to the management of the place.", "YTA.", "YTA. You DID steal it from someone. They probably accidentally forgot it, tried to get it back, and come to find out you had taken it already. And as we all know, when you take things that are not yours (which you did) that's called theft. You're a bad person and a thief and you need to make this right. And since you're a bad person and clearly don't know how to do the right thing, your first step is returning the bag to the Shake Shack you stole it from and telling the employee what happened in case the actual owner has tried to contact them.", "YTA. You hand it in to the people working at Shake Shack to make sure it is given back to the correct person. You are an adult and should know better. \n\nAt the age of 7 or 8, I found a five pound note on the sidewalk in Scotland. I picked it up unsure of what to do. I found a bobby (police officer) a short distance away and I asked him if he wanted it to give it back to the person who lost it. He told me with a very straight face that it was mine to keep because it wasn\u2019t enough for them to go looking for the person who lost it and it probably wasn\u2019t enough for the person to go to the police looking for it. Even at a young age, I was more concerned that I was stealing from someone even though it was on the sidewalk.", "YTA big time! I once spent my birthday money on MAC products and was so excited because I wasn\u2019t  well off at all and it was such a treat. I left the bag at the sushi place in the mall food court and was so distraught when I got home and couldn\u2019t find the bag (having adhd is a hoot). I was crying the whole drive back and was SO relieved when I went back to the sushi place and they had kept it aside for me.\n\nI think what you did was SO shitty and if you were a good person you would\u2019ve handed it in to the workers, you were not entitled to the products just because no one showed up within half an hour.", "Wow\u2026YTA. You could have left it with the cashier easy but you STOLE it.", "YTA.\n\nI absolutely would have given it to a manager/cashier to hold since it\u2019s likely the owner would call everywhere they had been to see if it had been found. \n\nYou\u2019re wrong to think it\u2019s yours because they didn\u2019t \u201cretrace steps immediately\u201d. They could have been at work & unable to leave, they could have been at a show (or performing in a show), they could have been all the way on the other side of the city or left the city entirely, they could have physical limitations, or been on a bus or didn\u2019t realize yet it was missing, etc. You don\u2019t get to choose an arbitrary time limit & decide they need to come back in person when the reality is most people (especially in a busy city) would likely call everywhere they had been as soon as they could.\n\nThere are finders/keepers situations, but this was not one of them. You did the wrong thing, and YTA.", "YTA. I'm sure we've all left things behind at one time or another, and gone back to see if they were still there, if and we're lucky a nice person found them and turned them in. You would be glad if that happened to you. So why can't you treat others similarly?\n\nIt's irrelevant what the clerk may or may not have done. Turning the bag in would've been the decent thing to do.\n\nYou're just trying to justify your selfishness.\n\nYears ago I did something similar. I found a camera in a public park. It was in the days of film cameras, and it wasn't a fancy one, it was a point and shoot camera. I took it and kept it. But you know what? I felt so guilty over not turning it in, that I could never use it. I eventually gave it away.\n\nSo yeah, turning the items in is a better thing to do.", "In the United States\n\n>The finder of lost property acquires a possessory right by taking physical control of the property, but does not necessarily have ownership of the property.

Policy can say that is has to be returned, and there are cameras, but... there's due process, and not always folks return everything they're supposed to, keys, id, wallets, money it gets returned, but other stuff like  a bag without id, or any identification, receipt  or any  means  to identify, then the manager/cashier/staff might not necessarily returned if they decide to keep it. I'm speaking from experience, not everyone does it, almost always things get returned, but there might be stuff that might want to keep. \n\nBottom line, you didn't steal anything, that was a lost package and you kept it. You found out the monetary value afterwards, you didn't think to give it to staff for lost and found, and if you did it, still it wouldn't guarantee the person would've returned for the bag, or the person would get it back from management.\n\nLegally you didn't steal the bag, and even with cameras, and you were identified what happened is not defined as theft.

Genuinely had no idea this stuff was expensive or a fancy brand in the first place, have never heard of it before now, but it doesn't matter if it was worth a dollar or a million, it still was an AH move. \n\nMost of you pointed out the golden rule that I disregarded here: what would I want to happen if I left something behind, expensive or otherwise? Obviously, I'd want my stuff turned in and held safely, who wouldn't? I've also found and turned in things many times before in stores, libraries, etc., not sure why I didn't this time. However, it absolutely doesn't work that way in reality. We've all had things stolen before and we've all left stuff behind that was gone when we went back for it. It sucks, but it happens. When it's happened to me, it's my own fault for forgetting the things or leaving them out and vulnerable without someone to watch them, because like me today, not everyone thinks about, has the wherewithal, or even cares about having lost items returned to their owners. I don't like that I contributed to that trend, but I was rushed, tired, and made an AH mistake, regressing to \"finders keepers\" in my rush instead of taking a few minutes to be nice. I was wrong, but unfortunately, I can't undo it this time. \n\nIn particular, thank you to the commenter who pointed out asking for a manager and turning it in with them would have been the best move, again I hadn't thought of escalating it that much and if this sort of thing happens in the future, that's what I'll do.", "YTT (you\u2019re the thief) (and the asshole)\n\nSeriously though, you suck.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you stole a bag because it was not guarded around the clock.", "YTA.

It will come back to you eventually.", "In 2006 or so, I was visiting Toronto, went to the mall and bought a perfume at Sephora and then went to browse Indigo. At some point, I set my Sephora bag down and didn't realize. After getting home (about an hour away), I realized that I no longer had the bag with my perfume. I wasn't able to get back until the next day, but someone had turned it in to the cashier and they held it. And that was just a $30 bottle of perfume!", "I have been this person, and 100% would have gone back in a panic. It was only 30 mins, ffs. OP is def TA.", "yeah that's so f***** up, the person probably didn't realize it until she got home. who knows if she'd been out drinking or was excited being a tourist in a new town or, just doing some after work shopping. I would be so f****** pissed. I have ADHD and PTSD from drama and have been known to forget things. I would be so upset if somebody stole my stuff. hopefully the OP brings it back to the restaurant and they can track down the guest via credit card trail.", "Imagine a kid left his bicycle just beyond the periphery of his parent\u2019s property line and this guy comes across it. Does he think he only ought to wait for half an hour and see if anyone comes to collect it, beyond which he can keep it because in his mind, it makes him eligible to be labeled a finder rather than a thief past that lookout for half an hour.", "Just did this with a water bottle.

They sat there going \u2018ah if was just some Aveeno who cares? Oh it\u2019s Drunk Elephant? Gimme the bag.\u2019\n\nIf you see stuff and don\u2019t recognise if it\u2019s $14 or a grand, I can see you Googling the brand to know where to hand it in. $14 the fast food place, 1k the counter (we have your credit card and can do match you back up! I once tracked a customer who spent 5k en route to the airport flying home to South Africa but left his passport. He mentioned he was going to a sporting goods shop nearby to pick up a custom shirt for his nephew and then was getting a cab to Heathrow. It was Christmas\u2026so I called the sports place, described him, explained and jumped in a black cab down and got him his passport. He would have missed Christmas. He then took the cab, paid my fare and was so grateful. Mad pre Christmas shift rest of day. At 5pm a hamper of food for the whole store arrived and the most spendy beautiful bunch of flowers for me. Note \u2018I will see my mum for Christmas thanks to you.\u2019) \n\nWe used post stuff out all the time. People who drop 1k on skincare are often rich and scatty or actually dazzled in the city. No one got thieved on my watch. Partly because I pride myself on being decent and because I earned commission, not doing it lost me customers and damaged our reputation.\n\nI sincerely hope grabby OP finds the skincare too rich and gets an annoying blemish or gets reported on a resale site that this \u2018haul\u2019 looks stolen.\n\nYTA. Grubby thinking.", "It actually doesn\u2019t matter if the cashier steals the items after OP turns them in.  That would just make the cashier a thief.", "Such a weird mentality to base your moral compass on what you think others may do. \"If they might do something wrong then I might as well too\"", "Oh man I got my drink spiked and my handbag went missing. My make up bag was in there. I was a professional MUA. My day to day kit inc brushes ran over \u00a3600 back in the early 2000s. My working kit was 40 kilos and 10k plus\u2026\n\nIn the middle of all the stuff that happened after the spiking while with police, a guy found the bag and handed it in. a) this helped police track via CCTV why it ended up there from where I was and b) the guy said \u2018it looked weird to see a nice bag dumped so I looked\u2026\u2019 The wallet with \u00a310 was missing and I don\u2019t care if he took it but he said \u2018my sister loves make up and I knew that stuff was expensive and probably meant something to the owner.\u2019\n\nHim bringing it back had the most profound effect at the darkest time of my life. Those brushes are still going strong. But getting my make up back, a stranger thinking \u2018ouch, that\u2019s some cash value, poor lady\u2019 was a kindness that I have carried for nearly 20 years. He just saw it that if it was work tools, records, sneakers, sports jersey that shit is expensive and no one he knew could replace it easily\n\nHe could have gifted his sister some serious nice stuff but he thought how gutted she would be and hoped someone would help her. He had no idea something darker had happened. He thought it got lost. He showed compassion and thought and I have no idea who he was but it really really gave me faith in people.\n\nThe police laughed why my make up bag was so expensive. I remember being so humiliated thst they were mocking my \u2018female\u2019 interests and suggesting \u2018nice girls don\u2019t\u2026\u2019 This man recognising that posh make up matters to its owner was such a contrast. I wish I could have told him how much he helped.", "Meh. Not disputing the YTA but this isn't that rigid. From personal experience, and police advice, posting on something like Craigslist covers your ass.\n\nI found a pair of diamond earrings in a cross walk once and didn't have time to take them to the police - I called later and they told me to post on Craigslist lost and found and Facebook...I also called stores in the vicinity and left my name and number in case someone called looking for them. I tried for a month and felt terrible for whomever lost them. They're fairly small and not worth a lot but I've always worried they had sentimental value to the person that lost them.", "I was guessing La Mer too.", "I stole from the lost and found at school every day.

It wasn\u2019t thoughtless; there was calculation in your move to take it: the easiest thing to do would have been to leave it and let some other asshole steal it. Instead you became the starring asshole in this drama and now you and your wife know your morals are deficient. I wonder where else you\u2019ve cut corners since this isn\u2019t even debatable and you are still not acknowledging you stole something.", "What did you do with it? You could take it back to where you found it.", "Yes, you are thieves.", "You didn't make a mistake, you made a conscious decision and you still think you didn't do anything wrong. You van still correct this. Call the restaurant,  tell them what you found and took, and leave your contact info in case someone comes looking for it. Set it back for 60 days, and if nobody contacts you, then you may keep it in good faith.", "Call the restaurant and say that you realized that when you left you took a bag that wasn't yours. Then, ask if someone came looking for that said bag.", "You're STILL trying to minimize and excuse your actions even after reading the comments!  \n\n>asking for a manager and turning it in with them would have been the best move, again I hadn't thought of escalating it that much and if this sort of thing happens in the future, that's what I'll do.\n\nThat's not an escalation. That's the bare minimum. Thief.", "I suggest you call the retailer. With the date and approximate time, you should be able to find who bought that particular combination of products. Almost everyone pays by credit card, especially for such a large purchase. Worst case, they would just refund the card.", "YTA. It didn't occur to you to let the manager know because you were too busy watching to see if someone would claim it before you took it home.", "Still a thief. At least fucking contact the shake shack about it, jesus", "So you claim you're not a thief, admit you took something that wasn't yours, then say \"we've all had things stolen before\". You are a thief (OMG LOL). And you will continue to be one until you take the items back to where you found them. I doubt you will do this, because it will be embarrassing, and possibly you or your spouse have already decided to use it. You are no better than the people who stuff these items down their underwear and waddle out the store with them. Please keep that image in mind whilst you and your wife enjoy your unlawfully gotten goods.", ">I don't like that I contributed to that trend, but I was rushed, tired, and made an AH mistake, regressing to \"finders keepers\" in my rush instead of taking a few minutes to be nice.\n\nIf you were \"rushed and tired\", why did you keep an eye on the bag for 30 minutes to see if someone would return for it?", "Dude, you totally are thieves. There is no such thing as regressing to finders keepers in public. It was in a bag and you eyed it for an hour. Further, you could be held criminally liable. It was literally a random bag in public lmao", ">I was wrong, but unfortunately, I can't undo it this time.\n\nWhat is stopping you from calling the restaurant, asking if someone came looking for the bag and if they left any contact information?", "This doesn\u2019t even sound like your apologetic.

If nobody shoots the man, your captors will. Regardless, everybody will be released at 6pm, and the man will be dead.

You can only stand for yourself if you do the right thing that's all you can do.", "I'm assuming OP is in the US, but where I am (not US) it would literally be a crime to do what they did. Technically if you find $5 on the ground you're meant to turn it in to the police. Find *anything* that isn't clearly garbage or naturally there, you turn it in (police or the store). Police will take your details and if unclaimed for I think it's 1 year, they call you and it becomes yours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope the rightful owner calls the Shack, they somehow have OP's details, and the knock at the door comes from the police rather than the owner.", "I\u2019m curious what constitutes a \u201clost and found\u201d in your mind, because your description of what happens at fast food places functions incredibly similarly to a lost and found.", "(and I for one hope it does....)", "Just did this yesterday- son lost his wallet, and the last place he remembered having it was at a fast food restaurant.
