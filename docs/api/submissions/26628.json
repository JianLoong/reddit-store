We took the train in and out and left the city a bit earlier to get home in time to take care of our dogs. We were in a bit of a rush but were super hungry and stopped for a quick meal at Shake Shack. We found a couple barstool seats and noticed a small shopping bag that had some skin care prodcuts in it, but no ID, wallet, or anything else (I checked). We didn't recognize the brand or store name and it was at the counter before we arrived. \n\nWe were there for about half an hour or so and kept an eye on the bag assuming someone would realize they left it and would come get it, but that didn't happen, so we just took it when we left. Later we sent a pic of the face cream to my brother's partner, who has worked in cosmetics for years. He told us they were super expensive products that totaled to nearly $1000 after taxes (the single face cream retails for like $300 and there were other items in the bag) and scolded us for not turning it in to the cashier. \n\nMy wife feels bad because we hadn't even considered doing that, but I don't feel at all guilty because we didn't steal it from someone, they left it and it had been parked there for at least half an hour, probably longer. It sucks and maybe we should have considered turning it in to the cashier or even looking up and travelling to the store to return it to them and let them sort it out, but that would have taken a long time, we were exhausted, and we were already rushing to get home as it was. We genuinely didn't think of it. \n\nIMO, if you've left behind something like that and didn't immediately retrace your steps to find it, then what happens happens. It sucks, and I don't mean to put down someone accidentially leaving something behind, it happens to all of us,  but no I do not feel bad to be the \"finder.\" Plus I can't help but wonder that any cashier would have been just as likely to keep it, too. Also, what realistically could they have done? It's not like a phone or wallet that could have been traced to the owner, there was no receipt in the bag or anything.

I hope karma bites you in the ass on this one.", "YTA\n\n\"Abandoned\" is not the right word. Don't try to make yourself feel better using language like that. Someone forgot their cosmetics, and you stole them, period. It would have taken very little effort or energy for you to simply leave the stuff with the cashier.\n\nInstead, you took something that was not yours.

The appropriate thing would have been you telling the cashier or anyone who worked there that someone left their shopping bag.

Thankfully I was able to get back most of the lost items because of good people who didn\u2019t think they were a finder or entitled to my property because I was absentminded.  That said, karma is a bitch\u2026\n\nEdit to add:  shake shack\u2019s in nyc\u2026especially the one in grand central, Madison square park, theatre district have cameras so if they really needed to see who took the bag, they\u2019d probably be able to easily identify you,", "YTA. You are lacking in ethics. They almost certainly returned looking for their bag and would have recovered their stuff if you had left it. You are opportunistic thieves. Shame.", "YTA, that is stealing in my opinion. Someone with decent morals would give it to the store to hold onto in the hopes they come back. How is that not even something you thought about doing?", "YTA\n\nSo it's okay for you to take skincare products that don't belong to you because you have the motto \"life sucks for you if you forget something\"? \n\nHow do you know if that was what that person was doing was going back for the bag? \n\nI hope you remember about what you said if you lost something of value to you.", "YTA.  You are thieves.", "YTA - Yes this is stealing. What grown person doesn't know if you find something that belongs to someone else in a place of business, you turn it in to an employee?? You make an insane amount of assumptions here. Maybe the person didn't notice the items were missing and showed up for them minutes after you stole them. Regardless you knew damn well they didn't belong to you.", "YTA you did actually steal it. Why would you have taken it? Common sense is give it to the manger of Shake Shack saying hey I think someone left this here.

It can take half an hour to travel a few blocks alone if traffics horrible some days, or if they had to rush off to an emergency and the bag was the last thing on their mind. \nPeople man - a lot of entitlement for someone with the mindset of a literal toddler.\n\nEdit: typo.", "YTA.

You're now a thief who stole $1k of goods. That's what the staff will see on cameras when the owner returns. \n\nDishonest people who sneakily grab someone else's property.

You did the wrong thing.", "\u201cAbandoned\u201d?   No.  The bag was left behind by a mistake, not abandoned.   This makes you and your wife bigger AHs because you are trying make it seem like this was a deliberate act of the original owners.  No one buys $1k in face cream to \u201cabandon\u201d it.  YTA.  You could have left it with a cashier.", "YTA- You stole.  You're just trying to find justification for doing it.", "YTA and also that's criminal larceny, you're damn lucky that it's under $1000, otherwise you're potentially looking at a felony.", "YTA.  Why not turn it in to the **manager** of the restaurant in case the shopper came back for it?  It might not be a phone, but someone spent their hard earned $$$ on that and isn't getting the $$$ back.  You're a stealer, plain and simple.", "Well in your case I hope the Shake shack doesn\u2019t have cameras to review when the person who forgot their face cream comes looking for it ! YTA", "When you find something that doesn't belong to you, you take it straight back to the cashier/reception.\n\nThe person who left the bag behind is bound to realize it and go back to get it. You don't leave something that expensive behind without looking back.

What a shame.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Seriously? You took something that didn't belong to you. You knew it didn't belong to you. Somehow the fact that you didn't know who it belonged to made it yours? So you live by Finders Keepers. Most of us got over that in childhood.", "YTA.  I feel sorry for those people, who probably will come back hoping some decent person turned it in to lost and found.\n\nYou are a flat-out thief.", "YTA. Someone is definitely not getting into the Good Place with those weak ethics.", "YTA for not turning it in to the cashier. You know that person retracing their steps? They're going to call the store or come back to the store. This was no more abandoned than if you had walked up to the coat rack at a restaurant and grabbed a coat you liked. This was not your bag to take.", "YTA - why didn\u2019t you tell the cashier and let the restaurant hold it until someone came back?\n\nAlso, what woman doesn\u2019t know La Mer? BS", "Yes you are the asshole. If I was the person and accidentally left 1k worth of items I would have hoped on my life a decent person would\u2019ve given it to a cashier, etc. \n\nThe person probably came back after you took it and asked the cashier if anyone had given them an unclaimed bag.\n\nThere is no way that person left essentially 1k and just didn\u2019t go back to look for it", "YTA. I don\u2019t get why you didn\u2019t leave it at the cashier. I always ask the cashier if they saw something I lost", "YTA.\n\nEasy peasy, cut-and-dry: without your *helpful* intervention, the real owner might have their stuff right now. If *nobody* touched it, they absolutely would have it back. Your actions deprived them of their purchases. It's not like you found a five dollar bill in the street. And you're really stretching to make it so you can keep the stuff without feeling like the Bad Guy. Make of that what you will.", "YTA. Turning it into place you were at is the right thing to do and you know that. It is stealing what you did. That person may have headed back to the place and retracing their steps.", "YTA. You are also a thief. What's the matter with you? You say something to your server or to the cashier on the way out. \"That bag has been sitting there for a while. Mind putting it behind the counter for the owner?\" How hard is that? I find it hard to believe it just didn't occur to you. Doesn't matter if the owner came back for it 10 minutes later or 3 hours later. IT. WASN'T. YOURS.", "Yta", "YTA.  You can try to rationalize it, but it is still theft.  You could have turned it in at the Shake Shack, or even checked with the store whose bag it was, but no.  You made excuses to justify theft in your mind by convincing yourself it wasn\u2019t.  You gaslit yourself.", "YTA it\u2019s common sense if you find something like that to give it to the staff where you are. You didn\u2019t have to trek to the company but there is no excuse for not handing it in to shake shack management\n\nYou are a thief\n\nI\u2019ve worked in retail and with lost goods we always kept them behind the counter for when someone came back", "YTA and you\u2019ve just racked up some seriously bad karma. May you never be dependent on the kindness of strangers", "YTA. You just cannot presume that the cashier would have kept it with himself too. If you have found something that is of a certain someone in a public place, you should return it back to the management of the place.", "YTA.", "YTA. You DID steal it from someone. They probably accidentally forgot it, tried to get it back, and come to find out you had taken it already. And as we all know, when you take things that are not yours (which you did) that's called theft. You're a bad person and a thief and you need to make this right. And since you're a bad person and clearly don't know how to do the right thing, your first step is returning the bag to the Shake Shack you stole it from and telling the employee what happened in case the actual owner has tried to contact them.", "YTA. You hand it in to the people working at Shake Shack to make sure it is given back to the correct person. You are an adult and should know better. \n\nAt the age of 7 or 8, I found a five pound note on the sidewalk in Scotland. I picked it up unsure of what to do. I found a bobby (police officer) a short distance away and I asked him if he wanted it to give it back to the person who lost it. He told me with a very straight face that it was mine to keep because it wasn\u2019t enough for them to go looking for the person who lost it and it probably wasn\u2019t enough for the person to go to the police looking for it. Even at a young age, I was more concerned that I was stealing from someone even though it was on the sidewalk.", "YTA big time! I once spent my birthday money on MAC products and was so excited because I wasn\u2019t  well off at all and it was such a treat. I left the bag at the sushi place in the mall food court and was so distraught when I got home and couldn\u2019t find the bag (having adhd is a hoot). I was crying the whole drive back and was SO relieved when I went back to the sushi place and they had kept it aside for me.\n\nI think what you did was SO shitty and if you were a good person you would\u2019ve handed it in to the workers, you were not entitled to the products just because no one showed up within half an hour.", "Wow\u2026YTA. You could have left it with the cashier easy but you STOLE it.", "YTA.\n\nI absolutely would have given it to a manager/cashier to hold since it\u2019s likely the owner would call everywhere they had been to see if it had been found. \n\nYou\u2019re wrong to think it\u2019s yours because they didn\u2019t \u201cretrace steps immediately\u201d. They could have been at work & unable to leave, they could have been at a show (or performing in a show), they could have been all the way on the other side of the city or left the city entirely, they could have physical limitations, or been on a bus or didn\u2019t realize yet it was missing, etc. You don\u2019t get to choose an arbitrary time limit & decide they need to come back in person when the reality is most people (especially in a busy city) would likely call everywhere they had been as soon as they could.\n\nThere are finders/keepers situations, but this was not one of them. You did the wrong thing, and YTA.", "YTA. I'm sure we've all left things behind at one time or another, and gone back to see if they were still there, if and we're lucky a nice person found them and turned them in. You would be glad if that happened to you. So why can't you treat others similarly?\n\nIt's irrelevant what the clerk may or may not have done. Turning the bag in would've been the decent thing to do.\n\nYou're just trying to justify your selfishness.\n\nYears ago I did something similar. I found a camera in a public park. It was in the days of film cameras, and it wasn't a fancy one, it was a point and shoot camera. I took it and kept it. But you know what? I felt so guilty over not turning it in, that I could never use it. I eventually gave it away.\n\nSo yeah, turning the items in is a better thing to do.", "In the United States\n\n>The finder of lost property acquires a possessory right by taking physical control of the property, but does not necessarily have ownership of the property.

Policy can say that is has to be returned, and there are cameras, but... there's due process, and not always folks return everything they're supposed to, keys, id, wallets, money it gets returned, but other stuff like  a bag without id, or any identification, receipt  or any  means  to identify, then the manager/cashier/staff might not necessarily returned if they decide to keep it. I'm speaking from experience, not everyone does it, almost always things get returned, but there might be stuff that might want to keep. \n\nBottom line, you didn't steal anything, that was a lost package and you kept it. You found out the monetary value afterwards, you didn't think to give it to staff for lost and found, and if you did it, still it wouldn't guarantee the person would've returned for the bag, or the person would get it back from management.\n\nLegally you didn't steal the bag, and even with cameras, and you were identified what happened is not defined as theft.

Genuinely had no idea this stuff was expensive or a fancy brand in the first place, have never heard of it before now, but it doesn't matter if it was worth a dollar or a million, it still was an AH move. \n\nMost of you pointed out the golden rule that I disregarded here: what would I want to happen if I left something behind, expensive or otherwise? Obviously, I'd want my stuff turned in and held safely, who wouldn't? I've also found and turned in things many times before in stores, libraries, etc., not sure why I didn't this time. However, it absolutely doesn't work that way in reality. We've all had things stolen before and we've all left stuff behind that was gone when we went back for it. It sucks, but it happens. When it's happened to me, it's my own fault for forgetting the things or leaving them out and vulnerable without someone to watch them, because like me today, not everyone thinks about, has the wherewithal, or even cares about having lost items returned to their owners. I don't like that I contributed to that trend, but I was rushed, tired, and made an AH mistake, regressing to \"finders keepers\" in my rush instead of taking a few minutes to be nice. I was wrong, but unfortunately, I can't undo it this time. \n\nIn particular, thank you to the commenter who pointed out asking for a manager and turning it in with them would have been the best move, again I hadn't thought of escalating it that much and if this sort of thing happens in the future, that's what I'll do.", "YTT (you\u2019re the thief) (and the asshole)\n\nSeriously though, you suck.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you stole a bag because it was not guarded around the clock.", "YTA.

Isn't that a fairly quick trip to the city?", "Not even the bare minimum, the bare minimum would have been to leave it where it was and they didn\u2019t even do *that*!", "To be fair to OP and wife, they tried nothing and they're all out of ideas", "Have you ever been so tired you stole something rather that just leaving it be?\n\nBeing tired is such a weird excuse to me.", "Exactly this. \n\nI cannot believe I read this \"update,\" and he's still all, \"oopsie, I was suuuuuper tired. won't do it again.\" \n\nWhy is he not calling that place and giving his contact info? He could even mail it if the person contacted him...instead of having to go into NYC again on the loooong, arduous journey lol\n\nHis wife has probably already started using the products.", ">So you claim you're not a thief, admit you took something that wasn't yours, then say \"we've all had things stolen before\".\n\nI love his line of reasoning- \"I've had things stolen from me because I was forgot where I left them, and therefore it was 100% my fault.  So, by that logic, the person who left their stuff is completely to blame and I am innocent of theft.\"", "Apparently Shake Shack in NYC has cameras so anyone looking at footage will see them acting squirrely with it. \n\nTbh I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they didn\u2019t deliberately sit where they were hiding the bag from other people\u2019s view.", "\"But I'm posting this at 11PM, and Shake Shack is closed right now.  I guess there's really nothing more I can do.\"", "He's posted to Reddit, asking if he is the asshole.  What more can an ordinary man be expected to do?", "Nothing.  They have no intention of doing anything.  They're thieves.", "He or his wife have opened the products and stuck their fingers in them. If they owned up, they'd have to replace the stuff. That's what's stopping them.", "Why would the retailer refund the card when the customer had left the shop with the goods?", "It might not even be a rich person, just an average person who saved to buy nice skincare, or specialist skincare because they have an issue with their skin.", "I went to the lost and found section at universal after realizing I lost the bag. When it wasn\u2019t returned until long after the park closed, they took my info and a description of the lost item to contact me if it turns back up.", "I was once walking at a rest area and saw what looked like a nice $10 note on the ground. I was so excited - $10 bucks!!\n\nTurned out to be $200. \ud83d\ude20. Why that face? Cos it was freaking cash. This rest area did not have a guest counter or anything. I couldn\u2019t very well wave $200 around - any number of people would try and claim it. I walked along the normal path, keeping an eye for anyone who might look like they could have dropped it and were looking for it (retracing their steps, for ex). \n\nI even waited near the cars where I found it for a bit (we were on the road somewhere an hour away). My friend was with me and we discussed options. No can do\n\nI left with the $200 burning a hole in my pocket (upset at the hole in someone else\u2019s) and basically ended up donating it in the next few months. Hoping that karma went back to the owner. \n\nYes it was a nice windfall and no, thinking about the person who lost it, worried how much this could\u2019ve meant to them - sucked.", "My grandma lost her phone a while back and it WAS locked unfortunately. But the guy who found it looked at the notifications, saw my brothers name from him texting her about a local politics group, then searched for my brothers name on Facebook and found a profile who was in the Facebook group for said local politics. Messaged my brother asking if this was grandmas phone. The next day he came and delivered it to her house. Her and my grandfather gave him \u00a350, none of us could believe how much effort he\u2019d gone to for it. And OP can\u2019t even walk five feet and hand a bag to the cashier?", "A friend of mine once left her cell phone at a pizza place. It was locked so they couldn\u2019t do anything with it right away, but her mom called so they answered lol. Told her where the phone was. Mom called friend\u2019s roommate and said that she tried to call daughter and got a pizza place hahah. Friend was able to go back and get it. It\u2019s not that hard to turn something in at the counter, OP.", "Another anecdote. I left my iPhone in the toilet at a MacDonald's in Cologne. Realised it half an hour later, called my number and got through to the cleaning staff who had found it and were keeping it for me.", "This is how I lost my N3DS, 25th LoZ edition, in a bus. Never found it though :( No one found it while cleaning or whatever. I'm still sad about it 10 years later.", "I love this take!", "I also refused to accept a cash reward when I found someone's wallet.

Great story.)", "You got lucky, I lost my wallet on a flight to SYD, I called and they said they had it, but all the cash was missing", "I hope OP paid with a credit card and the police show up at his door.", "The intent was there alright.", "Yep, if the problem really was that they were too tired to hand it in to the police then they would have just left the bag there, not stolen it. Picking it up and taking it with them took energy, they made that choice anyway", "It\u2019s a crime here too.", "it could be a misdemeanor in NY but even if you took it, if you return it to the person then you wont get charged", "OP said \"NYC\" - yes to being in the US", "Its NYC, the police are not going after these people for lost/stolen shopping bags.\n\nPlus, as someone whom travels the same route getting in and out of the NYC, I can tell you exactly where they were passing thru because he gave that much information.  Him and his wife were traveling through Grand Central Terminal and eating on the lower dining concourse.  They were probably either taking Metro North New Haven line, White Plains Line, or the new LIRR lines to Long Island.  Neither him or the person of the lost package will be found.  100s of thousands of people pass through Grand Central everyday.\n\nI digress... this scenario happens every day.  People are rushing to catch trains on the original upper and lower tracks and now the new Madison Concourse lines.  It's on OP's conscience that they took someone's lost package.  I'm guessing the stole La Mar face cream which starts at around $200 and goes upwards.  I feel sorry for the person who lost their package as they are never getting it back.", "Yeah it's illegal in my country too.", "They said they were in New York City, so yes US. It's also illegal here.", "The NYPD used to (probably still does tbh) set traps just like that. They\u2019d leave a purse or wallet or something on a bench in subway stations and arrest people who took them instead of turning them in. It\u2019s a fucked up thing to do for sure but OP could have actually gotten in legal trouble. \n\nBut also just YTA because they thought to grab it and take it but not to turn it in or tell someone it was there?", "Too exhausted to simply say to someone at the counter \"I think someone left this here\", but not too exhausted to keep their eyes on the bag the whole time, and then walk over and take it.", "\"Whatever happens happens.\"", "Yeah. Integrity takes a lot of energy too. Maybe if it had happened earlier in the day....", "Yeah like no one would think you need to take then back to the store they came from- just walk a few feet to the counter at the place you found them. How exhausting is that? Ppl are likely to go back to the last place they were to look for their lost item.", "They weren't too exhausted to take the bag.  They're TAH", "the measure of a person is what they do when nobody's watching.", "\"You leave my goddamn opinions out of this, sir!!\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "That's not my problem though. My problem is -  I will as much as possible act decently and ethically. What happens after that is not on me. \n\nSo that's why for me OP and his wife suck and no amount of their \"well other people would do X\" will convince me otherwise", "Prolonging the inevitable? An asshole or a saint, no one wants to deal with rush hour traffic.", "It's OK officer, I didn't realise the wad of notes I grabbed out the register amounted to $1000. My bad. \n\nYou sound goofy.", "1) There were cards inside but no hits for the name on FB - I still used that thing back then \n2) Where I live homeless folk go through trash for recycling, I tossed it with the cards because no reason to keep any of it \n3) Yes", "Man, I'm going to own so many houses by the end of this week. How has nobody exploited this 30 minute loophole yet? I keep hearing that home ownership is expensive and difficult but it sounds like I could easily pick up a couple houses on my day off.", "Let\u2019s face it, OP & wife probably already figured out in the burger place that this was expensive stuff. Otherwise who would bother carrying cheap stuff home on the train. I don\u2019t even get the fascination - expensive products like this need to be used regularly to do any good (if they are actually good) - where\u2019s OP going to steal more once the stash runs out?", "I visited New York recently and stayed in New Jersey because it's cheaper. Took me a half hour to get into the city by bus. Super easy, barely an inconvenience.", "That is what i don't get from OP. They talk about being too tired to think through what they were doing, but taking it takes way more thought process than just leaving it.", "I love that they \u201cdidn\u2019t have time\u201d to hand the bag in, but did have time to steal it rather than just LEAVE IT ALONE.

Like 2 hours according to google.", "Or, even simpler, OP simply doesn't want to to do anything.", "I do the same with every amount of cash I find, no matter how big or small. I think keeping something that it\u2019s not yours will bring bad energy into your house.", "I did that with a phone I found in the back of a car service car.

I reported it lost and a second later I got a message it was found.", "My wallet fell out of my back pocket at an NBA game in a restroom stall and I didn\u2019t notice until we got back to our seats.

I lose things all the time  and many New Yorkers have been kind enough to reunite me with my stuff. There's a lost and found at a lot of the big train stations.\n\nLet's not provide excuses for OP'S theft. Let's face it, they just wanted the fancy face cream and are trying to justify keeping it.", "The NYPD has gotten caught entrapping people with \u201clost\u201d bags on the subway though, so you never know", "You know they watched it like hawks the whole time praying no one would come claim it", "Jeffery Dahmer could also have used this catch-all excuse.", "It takes me 30 minutes to drive anywhere in the city at least.

I just kept thinking \"that is some childs doll, that they probably LOVE! And you want to take it home for a joke?\" I remember when my sister was about 6 and had this ratty ass doll that she slept with every night. She left it at the neighborhood playground one day and at bedtime she cried and cried because she couldn't find the doll. My dad drove down to the playground and thankfully found it. People who take shit that was accidentally left are assholes. They only waited 1/2 hour. The person who left it may not even have noticed it missing yet.", "So all you did was look for the name on FB?!?  That's super low effort before stealing someone's cash.", "Yes they definitely knew what they were doing. That\u2019s why they sat there staring at the bag hoping the owner wouldn\u2019t come back. OP is a liar and a thief.", "They're obviously a dishonest person, who is to say that they don't steal from stores just because they want expensive shit?  I have empathy for poor people who steal things like food, no empathy for people who steal stuff like this.  Fuck em.  Hope the cops get them.  Bet there was surveillance.
