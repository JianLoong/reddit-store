I think separating them was a good idea. If Elena wouldn't stop bullying Lauren, it isn't fair to Lauren to be subjected to that.", "NTA you attempted to stop the situation prior to sending her to her mom's as \"punishment\" the accident isn't your fault.", "NTA.  Your daughter is being bratty and manipulative which is typical of kids her age.  Don't let it get to you.  The grandparents should mind their own business.", "NTA accidents happen that is why they are accidents. Elena needs to understand that her actions were her choice and there are consequences to her actions. It\u2019s unfortunate that the accident happened but that does not mean that you do not care for her", "NTA.  The accident wasn\u2019t due to Elena\u2019s punishment.  You tried several ways to stop the bullying.  Elena needs therapy to get over whatever the heck her problem is.", "NTA. If Elena was not going to stop bullying her sister no matter what you did, you did the right thing removing her from the situation. There is no way for you to have predicted that the accident could have occurred - that is not on you. \n\nSwing what Elena said when she was in the hospital, I\u2019m starting to understand what your other sister is going through and why you separated them - that\u2019s a real prize attitude there! And it\u2019s obvious she has done a masterful job wrapping her grandparents around her finger. It\u2019s a shame, in the past, they didn\u2019t stand up for their other granddaughter like that.", "Why do you have both daughters at the same time? If they are both with you 50/50 and don\u2019t get along they should be alternating time, one should be with you one week, the other the next week.\n\nNTA for sending Elena home this one time, but honestly if this has happened many times you should have separated the girls before now. You will be an asshole if you don\u2019t fix it", "NTA! And it\u2019s scare me that a 14 year old is that malicious.. I wonder if her mom is telling her things to make her be like that to her older sister.. stand your ground and tell your parents what\u2019s going on so they know that Elena is been rude and mean to her older sister.", "The accident has nothing to do with any of this.\n\nBut the bullying should be addressed like it would be in any other family. Sit down together. Talk. Punish. Therapy. Not by sending your 14 year old child away. You wouldn\u2019t do that if you had full custody, you shouldn\u2019t do that when you have half custody, and it doesn\u2019t resolve anything. Don\u2019t know if you\u2019re an AH, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise parenting.", "YTA. The accident wasn\u2019t something you could have predicted so her comment about her life was a bit of a teenager thing BUT you should have stopped the bullying way before this.  You said she has a history of it. Well that\u2019s because you let it go on instead of stopping it. \n\nTwo kids. Two moms.  Even without two moms some sibling rivalry is normal but because of the two mom thing it\u2019s probably worse. You needed to do something long before this. And her mom also needs to be involved in telling her she doesn\u2019t have to love her half sister but she can\u2019t be mean.", "YTA. The crash is unfortunate but not the real issue. Her behaviour is bad, but sending her away is not an appropriate punishment. You have to find other ways of dealing with her behaviour without showing her that if she acts up she isn\u2019t welcome. That your love appears to her to be conditional on good behaviour. That\u2019s not ok.", "Soft YTA. I get why you did it, but this is just going to further convince Elena that you care more about Lauren than her.", "YTA. Sending your 14 yesr old away isn't going to fix this issue. You only have her 50/50 so she is already away from Lauren 50% of the time and it's done nothing. Sending her away is a cop out. And withholding your home until she improves her behavior isn't going to improve her behavior or endear her to you or Lauren. \n\nIt's really easy to see why a 14 year old would feel like you chose one kid over another here. Because you did. You decided Lauren's emotional state was more important than being a parent...\n\nHave you looked into family therapy? There are therapists out there that specialize in blended families. It may do all of you a ton of good.", "YTA. You can't just send your child away when they are being a brat. That's lazy parenting. Yes you are coparenting but what if you were not? Who would come pick up Elena when two of your children are fighting?", "YTA - Do you actually parent your child or just send her away when she is acting up?", "YTA.\n\nKids are hard but kicking them out of your house when they are still children is never an option. Do better.", "YTA you can just get rid of one child whenever they're inconvenient. She's being a bully but you need to find out why", "YTA for not getting to the root of why Elena makes fun of Lauren and just sending her to her moms instead of parenting her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and your wife for lazy parenting and not working at the root cause of the problem, and Elena obviously for being a bully and a manipulator.", "NTA your daughter is manipulating the situation and your parents are awful I feel bad for Lauren", "NTA, but also please be aware that \"mild concussion\" is just the name for a concussion where you didn't lose consciousness at the event. It is not a judgment on the severity of the concussion. Source: I had a mild concussion and it took me 6 months to properly walk and talk again. It was 3 years ago and I still have lingering damage that may never go away.", "YTA.\n\nBecause you didn't analyse why Elena is acting the way she is and why she has such animosity towards her sister. \n\nAssuming that you do know the reason, it still shows your lack of ability to control/persuade/convince/compromise her.", "yta", "I don't think she was trying to manipulate anyone. I think that's how she really feels and this is exactly why I thought I might be an asshole", "I don't have them at the same time I get 4 days alone with each and 3 days with both of them. They are sisters having them never see eachother doesn't seem like a good idea", "Agree!  And add: at this point you have set down an ultimatum and your daughter is a teen and will outlast you. Your 14 will not likely apologize and not come back to your house. This may be exactly what your daughter wants. Is mom\u2019s house more lenient? Or is she just more comfortable at mom\u2019s house?  This may be the end of your relationship with her if you don\u2019t do something. \nThe accident was a separate incident and she needs to know that it isn\u2019t your fault and it certainly isn\u2019t her fault.", "I disagree, Elena's statement to his parents shows that she's knows how to push buttons and manipulate people.   She knew her behavior was wrong and tried to blame the OP for the accident.\n\nHe said that Elena is therapy already.", "Asking what If is meaningless,  what if he was just a single dad because the mother had died? What if the kids were originally orphans? What if the kids had the same mother? What If they were different ages? \n\nThe story we were given is with the factors of how it IS not what it isn't. \n\nOBVIOUSLY if OP wasn't co-parenting this situation and all the children's lives prior to this moment would have been different. Asking what if about a specific situation won't change a single thing. You're entitled to your vote but it's safe to say that the kid was only sent to the mother because the mother is there.", "Of course I parent her but I have 2 kids that I need to parent and one of them was traumatizing the other one and nothing I did stopped her", "I know why. She thinks Lauren is my favorite because I was in Lauren's life since she was born but I wasn't in Elena's life until she was 6 which was because neither me nor her mom had any idea that she was mine. I explained this to her. Multiple times. But she won't accept it", "Teenage girls are master manipulators and your daughter is a classic mean girl. I teach 12th grade. She seized this opportunity to get out of apologizing and will keep using it over and over. \n\n*Please do not let up on the need for an apology.* You are a good dad you did the right thing. Because if the roles were reversed you would have done the same thing.", "Nope. It\u2019s manipulation and if you relent on any consequences, she will know she can get away with it. When she feels better physically, have a chat with her. The accident was an unfortunate turn of events, but not your fault.\nShe is clearly already quite bad with the bullying if none of your other efforts work.\nCompletely NTA.", "Can you explain why you think having them see each other right now is a good idea?\n\nBecause right now it looks like having them around each other is only damaging your oldest daughters body image and self esteem/self image and reinforcing your youngest daughters feelings of being less loved/abandoned", "I get that. But it may be a good idea to see them separately temporarily until things cool down.", "Family therapy and individual therapy are different and could help with different issues. \n\nAlso, a lot of families are unable to just send a kid away when they are misbehaving. Elena is 14. Yes, what she said was wrong and manipulative, I agree. But just because your kid is manipulative doesn't mean you get to send them off and basically hope the other parent can do your job for you. OP needs to work with Elena here. Sending her off isn't going to help.\n\nETA: Also, just because what she said is manipulative doesn't mean that isn't how she feels. She may genuinely believe her father cares more for Lauren than herself. Which would begin to explain why she is so rude to her sister.", "I don't know I feel like my what if it is more so that those are his two children. He can't just send one away when she starts to misbehave.\n\nHe has that privilege at the moment cause he is coparenting but as a parent you should be dealing with your children misbehaving, because you don't really have the option just send one away when things get too hard.", "Edit:  I see that she is in counseling.   Talk to her counselor to see what else you can do to reinforce acceptable behavior.\n\nAlso, you should talk to your parents about how quickly they jumped to swallowing Elena's story.", "Both of your daughters would benefit from therapy.", "Have you gone to therapy with your daughter? Do you make the effort to spend one on one time together?", "Sending her home for making fun of Lauren only reinforces beliefs that you like Lauren better. You need to spend some one on one time with her to improve your relationship. Don\u2019t use time with you as a reward/punishment. That will definitely make you an AH.", "Yeah but we were also told that he has attempted to correct the actions already it seemed to me at least that sending her to the mom was a punishment especially stating she can come back once she's apologized. \n\n\"I'm sending you to your mom's until you learn\"\n\"You're grounded until you can learn to behave\"\n\nI feel they are both synonymous punishments but the going to the moms would be preferable", "She is in therapy\n\nWe used to spend a lot of time together then she became a teenager and decided she hates all of us", "I don't know to me it just feels like he is not actually dealing with problem, more so taking the problem away. Regardless that's his child, so he is not going to see his child until she behaves?\nAt the end of the day the problem is still here, the moment the girls come visit him again, same thing will most likely happen."]}
