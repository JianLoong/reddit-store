Your daughter is being bratty and manipulative which is typical of kids her age.  Don't let it get to you.  The grandparents should mind their own business.", "NTA accidents happen that is why they are accidents. Elena needs to understand that her actions were her choice and there are consequences to her actions. It\u2019s unfortunate that the accident happened but that does not mean that you do not care for her", "NTA.  The accident wasn\u2019t due to Elena\u2019s punishment.  You tried several ways to stop the bullying.  Elena needs therapy to get over whatever the heck her problem is.", "NTA. If Elena was not going to stop bullying her sister no matter what you did, you did the right thing removing her from the situation. There is no way for you to have predicted that the accident could have occurred - that is not on you. \n\nSwing what Elena said when she was in the hospital, I\u2019m starting to understand what your other sister is going through and why you separated them - that\u2019s a real prize attitude there!

You will be an asshole if you don\u2019t fix it", "NTA! And it\u2019s scare me that a 14 year old is that malicious.. I wonder if her mom is telling her things to make her be like that to her older sister.. stand your ground and tell your parents what\u2019s going on so they know that Elena is been rude and mean to her older sister.", "The accident has nothing to do with any of this.\n\nBut the bullying should be addressed like it would be in any other family. Sit down together. Talk. Punish. Therapy. Not by sending your 14 year old child away. You wouldn\u2019t do that if you had full custody, you shouldn\u2019t do that when you have half custody, and it doesn\u2019t resolve anything.

The accident wasn\u2019t something you could have predicted so her comment about her life was a bit of a teenager thing BUT you should have stopped the bullying way before this.  You said she has a history of it. Well that\u2019s because you let it go on instead of stopping it. \n\nTwo kids. Two moms.  Even without two moms some sibling rivalry is normal but because of the two mom thing it\u2019s probably worse. You needed to do something long before this. And her mom also needs to be involved in telling her she doesn\u2019t have to love her half sister but she can\u2019t be mean.", "YTA. The crash is unfortunate but not the real issue. Her behaviour is bad, but sending her away is not an appropriate punishment. You have to find other ways of dealing with her behaviour without showing her that if she acts up she isn\u2019t welcome. That your love appears to her to be conditional on good behaviour. That\u2019s not ok.", "Soft YTA. I get why you did it, but this is just going to further convince Elena that you care more about Lauren than her.", "YTA. Sending your 14 yesr old away isn't going to fix this issue. You only have her 50/50 so she is already away from Lauren 50% of the time and it's done nothing. Sending her away is a cop out. And withholding your home until she improves her behavior isn't going to improve her behavior or endear her to you or Lauren. \n\nIt's really easy to see why a 14 year old would feel like you chose one kid over another here. Because you did. You decided Lauren's emotional state was more important than being a parent...\n\nHave you looked into family therapy? There are therapists out there that specialize in blended families. It may do all of you a ton of good.", "YTA. You can't just send your child away when they are being a brat. That's lazy parenting.

Your 14 will not likely apologize and not come back to your house. This may be exactly what your daughter wants. Is mom\u2019s house more lenient? Or is she just more comfortable at mom\u2019s house?  This may be the end of your relationship with her if you don\u2019t do something. \nThe accident was a separate incident and she needs to know that it isn\u2019t your fault and it certainly isn\u2019t her fault.", "I disagree, Elena's statement to his parents shows that she's knows how to push buttons and manipulate people.

She thinks Lauren is my favorite because I was in Lauren's life since she was born but I wasn't in Elena's life until she was 6 which was because neither me nor her mom had any idea that she was mine.

But it may be a good idea to see them separately temporarily until things cool down.", "Family therapy and individual therapy are different and could help with different issues. \n\nAlso, a lot of families are unable to just send a kid away when they are misbehaving. Elena is 14. Yes, what she said was wrong and manipulative, I agree. But just because your kid is manipulative doesn't mean you get to send them off and basically hope the other parent can do your job for you. OP needs to work with Elena here. Sending her off isn't going to help.\n\nETA: Also, just because what she said is manipulative doesn't mean that isn't how she feels.

Which would begin to explain why she is so rude to her sister.", "I don't know I feel like my what if it is more so that those are his two children. He can't just send one away when she starts to misbehave.\n\nHe has that privilege at the moment cause he is coparenting but as a parent you should be dealing with your children misbehaving, because you don't really have the option just send one away when things get too hard.", "Edit:  I see that she is in counseling.   Talk to her counselor to see what else you can do to reinforce acceptable behavior.\n\nAlso, you should talk to your parents about how quickly they jumped to swallowing Elena's story.", "Both of your daughters would benefit from therapy.", "Have you gone to therapy with your daughter?

The minute she had a chance to avoid the consequences of her own actions she took it and put all the blame on you. She knew full well bullying her sister was wrong and she continued it anyways. Do not let her use this accident as another reason to keep being horrible to other people. And don't let her manipulate the other adults into turning against you.", "NTA.

Were you supposed to predict the accident? Were you supposed to accept her delusional complaint? Why are they taking the bully\u2018s side in all this?", "NTA. Your daughter is being a little prick. That's normal for kids. Let her be angry. But dont ban her from your house.  Send her to her room when shes being a bully and make it clear she cannot come out till shes done and apologizes.

You have to keep your kid safe, but you also can\u2019t send a kid away. \n\nThis is complex, and you guys should find a family therapist work you through it. Maybe the bully was trying to manipulate you, but may have been doing it through what she feels is the truth. Logic and rationality aren\u2019t in play right now, and it\u2019s going to take time to sort through this and whatever is going on between the girls.\n\nGet help, listen, and be more present so the girls cannot have these sort of awful interactions. It will take more effort on your part, but it\u2019s necessary for now.", "NTA. Your daughter is being a brat and sending her away was a good call on your part.", "NTA for sending your daughter home. It's your job as a father to protect your children where you are able, even from their siblings. YWBTA if you do not pursue this to find out why the bullying is occurring.  There is a reason and it's up to you to find it. Time for a serious one on one conversation to see why your daughter thinks it is ok to treat her sister like that.

Period.", "Since you\u2019ve said in a comment that the issue was that Elena\u2019s mother was too tired to drive, which is almost definitely why they crashed in the first place, YTA. It was your responsibility to take her home.", "NTA - you clearly communicated your expectations (which were completely realistic).", "Not sure what you hoped to accomplish.

YTA", "YTA you just can't toss out your child like trash. You should made her stop and make it work \nShe is 14 and most states (if u live in the US) she can decide where to live and not wanting to see you or live with you. Edit.

One week  Lauren then the next week Eliana.", "YTA, you can't just throw a child away when they misbehave.", "[deleted]", "I haven't had the chance to talk to her about this I don't think this is a good time. she is still in the hospital for some injuries but the doctors said she'll be fine", "Yes they think it was still wrong to send her with her mom", "OP admitted in a comment that his ex didn't feel safe to drive due to tiredness, and he pushed her to pick the kid up anyway.", "They are mad because her mom said she is too tired to drive and doesn't feel good about this but I insisted", "Wrong post", "No, she is being a bully and manipulative.  She knows exactly what she is doing, maybe not why.  But she knows it bothers sister, yet she keeps doing it.  Then she gets mad when she is sent home.  She knew exactly what to say to your parents to get the reaction she wanted.  The question is WHY?  Why is she doing what she is doing.  Maybe she needs therapy to figure out her feelings of jealousy and resentment.  I suggest family therapy as well.  And for your older daughter, come up with ways to counteract her sisters behavior.  Elena knows it gets to Lauren.  Lauren can come up with snippy comebacks, shake her head , laugh and walk away.  Elena needs to be sent to her room until she can apologize for her behavior.", "Hi! So I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019ve spoken to Elena about her lack of empathy? Why does she think it\u2019s ok to make fun of someone\u2019s weight? Why does she think it\u2019s ok to comment on someone else\u2019s appearance at all? Why does she feel nothing about her sisters struggle and hurt? Like what\u2019s going on there? Does she feel superior to all heavy people? Does she get off on making people feel badly about themselves? I\u2019d be realllyyy alarmed by this behavior as a parent.", "It is very much possible that she genuinely feels this way, but just because she feels this way doesn't mean that it is correct. \n\nUnless you have a crystal ball the chance of het getting hurt after being picked up by her mother was the same as for example when going to school tomorrow, in other words the same risk level as  living everyday life. Based on any knowledge that you could reasonably have been expected to have, you made the right decision. \n\nYour youngest daughter must have already felt rejected after being sent away, and instead of having quiet time at her mom's to cool down she went through a traumatic event, and shock + hurt + teenage hormones does not make for the most rational actions or feelings.\n\nStill, you handled things correctly based on the information you had, so however she feels, you are not the asshole", "No\u2026I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve been a teenage girl and she\u2019s being manipulative", "Very few bullies think they're the bully; they tell themselves every manner of fairy story to justify their unjustifiable behavior.\n\nNTA.

Bullying is never OK.", "Um, it's not a good idea now to get them together. It's not going to get magically better you know? I think you should separate them for the time being and do something about Elena, therapy, talking, etc. Of course help your other daughter too because I'm sure the bullying did a number on her.
