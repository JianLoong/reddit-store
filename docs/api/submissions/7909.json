Even without two moms some sibling rivalry is normal but because of the two mom thing it\u2019s probably worse. You needed to do something long before this.

I myself did things like that at that age (not so far as giving myself a concussion, but still).", "Yep. NTA op.", "NTA. While the accident would not have happened had you not punished your daughter in that way, it is still an accident, and you didn't wish it on your daughter. I understand why your daughter feels like there is somehow a link, because she's in pain and angry. But you are (of course) totally blameless, and you did definitely do the right thing in preventing your older daughter being any more of a target for her sister's insults.\n\nCorrelation doesn't equal causation!", "NTA but she\u2019s a bully and I promise you, she\u2019s bullying others you aren\u2019t aware of. You\u2019re being played but don\u2019t want to see it because you love her, which is wonderful but can also be blinding.", "What would you have done had you been the 100% parent? Sent her away somewhere else?\n\nSending her back to Mum's was no solution. You need to address the problem, not avoid it.\n\nI wouldn't call you the arsehole here, but I think you played it badly.", "NTA. it's horrible that that happened on their way home, of course. but you need to protect your daughter from people who are mean to her, including your other daughter.", "NTA wow Elena needs therapy a bully and a manipulator. If you don\u2019t address this she could get worse. She used her accident as a way to guilt you.", "NTA but Elena needs therapy", "Nta Your daughter sounds like she\u2019s becoming territorial of you I would nip this in the butt However you can add that mean separating them or whatever and you need to talk to your parents letting them know that it\u2019s your decision and you\u2019re no longer a child and they have no right to berate you and they need to get over themselves", "NTA - And both daughters need therapy. One to deal with the consequences of the bullying, the other to get to the root of why she's bullying.", "NTA. She\u2019s a brat that needs to be put in her place. Maybe have her talk to someone who lost a loved one to suicide. Because that is exactly what happens when people bully others, they off themselves and it will be her fault.", "NTA. Elena is a bully and now she's trying to play the victim and gain sympathy points with your parents by acting all poor me, my Daddy is out to hurt me because I received consequences for my bullying behavior. Your parents are also TA if you explained the situation to them and they're still name calling you.", "[removed]", "Im going against the grain here & saying slight AH. Its not your exs job to parent during your time. You take her phone/tablet, send her to her room, have her mom come over & help you parent together, etc. It helps to separate them sometimes but by sending her to moms, she not only faces no real punishment, but your teaching her she can cause pain & walk away. She should absolutely have to view the hurt she causes her sister. Next time she wants to spend time w mom or her friend group over there, she knows how to get it", "Nta your kid is though and your parents are for believing her bullshit.", "no", "Absolutely NTA!  You cannot allow one daughter to bully another.  Elena was given the option to stop bullying\u2026.she chose to continue and you issued consequences.  She\u2019s 14 and she is overly dramatic.  She also is a bully and now she is bullying you.  Don\u2019t give in.  Lauren\u2019s emotional response to her sister\u2019s bullying could have serious, life threatening consequences for Lauren.  You did the right thing by separating them.", "NTA Tell the younger one that making fun of her sister is more important to her than spending time with you. Tell her you love her and want to spend time with her but if she can't be respectful and treat her sister dignity then that is her choice.  You would make her sister leave too if she were treating her that way. Custody is set this is your time the court had set for her to be with you. Or just be real and tell her she is being a little bit\u00a2h and she needs to cut the crap and grow up", "He stated that he already tried to discipline Elena and it didn't work, hence why he sent her back home because at this rate it's affecting Lauren's wellbeing. NTA.", "If that's what Elena believes, then that's on her. She's getting sent away for being a bully, not because she's cared for any less. She should know this and stop with her victim mentality.", "This is a good time for \"That's not true, and I know deep down you know that\"\n\nIt *does* make me wonder if she's being a \"manipulative mean girl\" like people say, or if in her twisted teenage brain she thinks she has to compete with her sister for the \"favorite daughter\" position.\n\nEither way she needs some serious correction.", "I wish I had a solution for you but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH. I have a daughter who is also a bully and mean and selfish and quite frankly disappointing. She does a mental gymnastics to blame everyone else for any problems she has.  It breaks my heart the way she torments her brother. I pray it\u2019s just a phase. I don\u2019t want to blame hormones but it may be part of the problem. She exhausts my patience with her lies and manipulation. I don\u2019t understand why she is this way her younger brother is the exact opposite. Empathetic, kind, and helpful. She\u2019s had every single opportunity that he has. She chooses not to participate because he\u2019s there 90% of the time. I know it\u2019s jealousy but it\u2019s so unwarranted.\nExample: a stranger pulled me aside to tell me she asked her brother to bite her so her father would buy her something.", ">they had an accident and are in the hospital. I rushed there. They are both fine.\n\nAlthough it isn't explicitly stated it is pretty clear that daughter and mother were in a accident. Where you are coming from questioning if there was really an accident or if it was possible neglect is bizarre.", "And as soon Elena tried to say it was my fault, I would have wanted to say that her bullying caused it, and ask if it was worth it.\n\nThen I would block anyone calling me names for trying to parent my kids.", "NTA. Change your custody schedule so you don\u2019t have them at the same time.", "NTA your daughter is a manipulative bully. Get her some therapy and or an exorcism before this behavior gets worse.... keep her away from her sister until she's ready to change her ways. Things have escalated quite abit so the last thing you want is your daughters getting physical with eachother.", "NTA. Simply put, you can't tolerate bullying. It's unacceptable in or out of the family and your daughter will need to understand that. I'd also try to investigate if she does this to others. More than parental intervention might be required if so.", "Nta, I would've done the same. Next time it is brought up to you tell them you'll send her home everytime she's a bully.", "Your younger daughter is an ah!  She knows that she is bullying her sister, hitting her where it hurts and she expects everyone to let her say what she wants with no consequences", "NTA. Nobody likes (or tolerates) a bully. The sooner that Elena understands that, the better", "NTA. You had no crystal ball to know this would happen. And Elena HAD to be sent home to protect her sister. So tell Elena it was her fault?", "I think it may be helpful if you all went to therapy together.", "You have to keep repeating ad nauseum that it\u2019s not ok to bully people. That you understand that she might be hurting emotionally but that doesn\u2019t give her the right to inflict pain on other people. You can also emphasize that if the tables were ever turned and she was bullied, you\u2019d have the same response. It\u2019s never ok and this behavior cannot be allowed. Also continue to take away privileges or whatever the punishment is until she apologizes or meets any other goal posts that you set for her. It may be wise to get a psychologist involved to help as well", "She needs therapy because she is a bully and sounds manipulative.", "Wait, how did you forget to add this information in the post? This changes everything. To me YTA, you do not send your kids away when they misbehave, you parent them. You could have sent her to a different room. What if you and her mother lived in the same house? You would have sent her in the streets?", "This is crucial information left out of the original post. I don\u2019t blame you for separating them, but if your solution was to knowingly put your daughter in the car with someone who should not have been driving, you need to take some accountability for that choice. Your other daughter is 16, you could have driven Elena to her mother\u2019s yourself. Im also never a fan of kicking a child out of their home for bad behavior. It sends the message that their place in the home is conditional. \n\nIf the root of the issue is truly that Elena feels you favor Lauren, this will never be resolved until Elena feels secure in her relationship with you, so put your focus there, then focus on how harmful her actions have been.  It\u2019s clear she isn\u2019t feeling the love from you for whatever reason so that needs to be sorted. \n\nI wish you all the luck in sorting this out, but you\u2019re going to have to put in the work.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s Reddit. Rushing to extremes is required. Especially on this sub.", "Are you both girls aunt? Or just Elanas? Because this is blatant manipulation tactic. A mild concussion is not a seriously hurt by any sense of the word, are you saying he lied and she suffered a worse fate than a mild concussion? How about instead of saying he favors Lauren you give us an example because all we have here is one sister bullying the other and refusing to apologize and then blaming an accident on her dad when the only reason she was in the car was she was being awful to her half sister and refused to apologize.", "Just read your other comments here and it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re only elanas aunt and one of the reasons she\u2019s so comfortable being awful to her sister. Everything is everyone else\u2019s fault and she is a perfect angel according to you. You\u2019ve even blamed her mother in comment for driving tired.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "Yea, I no longer believe anything you say. You seem to be one of the reasons she seems completely okay being awful to her half sister. At worst you\u2019re a willing participant in her bullying at best you have fallen for the manipulation.", "It was in her control to apologize for bullying her sister. You\u2019re an adult in her life and make up a million excuses for her behavior. Including her father should\u2019ve just allowed her to torment her sister.", "[removed]", "Yep and apparently you know about both physical and emotional abuse and you allow her to go over there still."]}
