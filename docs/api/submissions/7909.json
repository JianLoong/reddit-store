It\u2019s unfortunate that the accident happened but that does not mean that you do not care for her", "NTA.  The accident wasn\u2019t due to Elena\u2019s punishment.

Even without two moms some sibling rivalry is normal but because of the two mom thing it\u2019s probably worse. You needed to do something long before this.

I get why you did it, but this is just going to further convince Elena that you care more about Lauren than her.", "YTA. Sending your 14 yesr old away isn't going to fix this issue. You only have her 50/50 so she is already away from Lauren 50% of the time and it's done nothing. Sending her away is a cop out. And withholding your home until she improves her behavior isn't going to improve her behavior or endear her to you or Lauren. \n\nIt's really easy to see why a 14 year old would feel like you chose one kid over another here.

She knows exactly what she is doing, maybe not why.  But she knows it bothers sister, yet she keeps doing it.  Then she gets mad when she is sent home.  She knew exactly what to say to your parents to get the reaction she wanted.  The question is WHY?  Why is she doing what she is doing.  Maybe she needs therapy to figure out her feelings of jealousy and resentment.  I suggest family therapy as well.  And for your older daughter, come up with ways to counteract her sisters behavior.

If your other child is the bully - then you need to separate them and get her therapy - because there is something wrong in her brain if she thinks this is ok.\n\nGo to therapy with her, dont push Lauren into this, she is the victim. Get Elena to talk with you and a therapist why she thinks its fine to make fun of someone's weight and destroy their self esteem. She needs to know she could cause her sister to have a food disorder or feel suicidal even.\n\nDont put them together again - you may be both their fathers, but they have different mothers and Elena hates your other daughter.  Until you sort this - the priority is protecting the child that is being mentally abused and bullied.\n\nSpeak to the school -  or if you know any mutual parents with kids in her class - get some information about how she treats other people.", " NTA. Daughter was being a dick to her sister so you sent her to her mum\u2019s where she can\u2019t be a sick to her sister. Accident is an accident", "Yta. Learn to parent", "NTA. You know what, yeah a good kid who hurts nobody IS more important that a selfish little bully. \nMaybe she should look at it as karma giving her a warning that if she hadn\u2019t been a bully she wouldn\u2019t have been hurt and next time karma comes by it might not be as kind.", "NTA. But sending a kid away is not going to fix the issue of her verbally bullying her sister.\n\nget a therapist and see that she goes, and you go, too.  Both girls need it, and you need better tools to deal with the bullying.  It won\u2019t hurt, and you could find out what is causing it.", "YTA because you basically refused to deal with and discipline your daughter. Instead you sent her back to her mother. \n\nIf the two girls were with you full time you wouldn\u2019t have this luxury. I have two kids , and if they\u2019re fighting and one is in the wrong I deal with it instead of sending them back to the other parent. \nThat makes no sense to me what you did. \n\nYour daughter is acting badly towards her sister, if you won\u2019t protect them both (one from being a bully and the other from being bullied) then don\u2019t take them at the same time.", "NTA.", "So it's your fault for her mother getting in an accident? Lol NTA obviously you didn't know that would happen.", "NTA. Your daughter was being a bully and refused to listen to you. She was involved in an ACCIDENT. Accidents are un planned for things that happen and cannot be foreseen. She was being a brat when she then LIED to your parents to gain sympathy. Not okay.", "> I know why. She thinks Lauren is my favorite because I was in Lauren's life since she was born but I wasn't in Elena's life until she was 6 which was because neither me nor her mom had any idea that she was mine. I explained this to her. Multiple times. But she won't accept it.\n\nINFO: What exactly is the timeline here? 14 and 16 is a pretty close age gap to have kids by two different mothers. Is it possible that the strife between your daughters is because they\u2019re both old enough and smart enough to notice that the math might not be mathing?", "Your younger daughter is being manipulative and your parents are assholes. \n\nYour younger child is a bully. You handled the situation by  having her mother pick her up and now she is deflecting. Your parents need to keep out of your business. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nFIRST: Your daughter is being an AH because AH is a normal behavior at her age. Dont let her manipulate you!\n\nSECOND: Maybe therapy so she can learn more mature techniques of communication, as well as how to more effectively handle her very normal emotions besides abusing someone else verbally. Also therapy for your older daughter so she has a safe place to process the abuse younger daughter is dishing out. \n\nTHIRD: Can you rearrange your 50/50 schedule so that the time with your daughters is opposite each other?", "You're all a bunch of immature assholes. JFC", "Yeah agree. What do the girls' Mums think of the situation? NTA.", "Mom was at work or on her way home. OP's house is on her route home. Mom had planned to drive at that time and on those roads, tired or not. This didn't add any more driving than she had already planned to do -- unless she had planned to sleep at work?", "Elena either learned the bullying and victim blaming at home (likely from mom seeing how OP reacted) or is acting out because she wants her parents together. Often kids in blended families blame their step/half siblings for ruining their family. This is usually more common in older siblings, however. \n\nElena is also at an age where this type of black and white thinking is normal and an age where many kids struggle with taking responsibility. She needs to be held accountable for her words and actions, which OP is doing or attempting to do.\n\nNTA. But how did she get the concussion? Was it for sure an accident or did she possibly hurt herself for attention? Was it from neglect on the part of mom?", "NTA. Your daughter is engaging in bullying behavior against her half-sister, consequences need to happen. It's incredibly unfortunate that they hd an accident but the comments she made to her grandparents were malicious and manipulative, it's important to call her out on it and teach her some humility and empathy.", "If you feel like an asshole, it's because she successfully manipulated you. NTA.", "No, shes 100% manipulative, she saw an opportunity to avoid accountability. next time you try to curb her bullying she will bring up the accident and try to make it your fault, its not.\n\nNTA", "Well, I feel that god was punishing her for being a bitch to her sister.  Maybe we will never know for sure, but she should stop being a jerk just in case, yeah?  Life is short and fragile and does she want the last thing she said to be cruel?", "She can be bullying and manipulative and also actually feel this way. They are exclusive to each other. NTA. Clearly you didn't cause the wreck or want either of your daughters hurt emotionally or physically.", "As someone who was a lot like Elena as a teen, I can tell you that she's doing it to manipulate you.  She probably had that sentence in her head for a while, waiting for someone to ask that question.", "No she is definitely manipulating you. This is classic. She is a bully. And a bully spins things round and now she has her grand parents eating out of her palms and you questioning yourself.\n\nThe bottom line is - there is something wrong in her brain if she thinks its acceptable to bully another person. To mock their weight and damage their self esteem. Its worse if she is doing it to a family member. Lauren is being abused in her own home. There is nothing Elena can feel to justify the bullying to her sister. Her comments could lead to Laura having an eating disorder or end up feeling suicidal. \n\nElena is upset you called her out and made her leave. What happened was fluke.  And actually if she'd not been a bully she's the one who would not have ended up in that situation.\n\nTell your parents to step aside.", "Miriam Webster\n\nManipulate: to control or play upon by artful, unfair, or insidious means especially to one's own advantage\n\nYour daughter is using the accident in order to play upon your (and everyone else's) emotions - mainly to make you look bad and feel guilty. \n\nTo use the same tactic from a different perspective you could say, \"she was being horrible to her sister constantly, if she just could have been nice she would be fine right now, but she decided getting injured was worth the continued bullying of her sister!\"\n\nSee how manipulative it would be if you told everybody your daughter knew she would get injured if she bullied her sister, but she decided being a monster was worth it?\n\nSee how she is acting like you should have predicted an accident would happen and still decided to send her away? \n\nThat's pure manipulation.", "NTA - you could not have predicted what was going to happen.  Your daughter has to learn a tough lesson about consequences and right now she is blaming you for something that is really her fault.  I saw what you did as giving her a time out at Mom's when she wouldn't listen.  She's 14 and you should not expect her to say and act like an adult yet.  But I would keep the two girls on separate schedules going forward.", "Definitely need to wait if she's still being treated. I saw your comment about why the 14 yr old acts the way she does. That plays a big factor in all this. So making her Mom come get her probably compounded the situation. You definitely need to sit down and talk with her mother. There's no excuse for the comments she is making to her sister. But you need to find a different way to handle her behavior.", "What would you do if you didn't have a place to send her?  Maybe you need to learn how to deal with things at your home without sending the child away.  All of my children live with me and my husband all the time.  If they do this we deal with it.  You need to fix what happens in your home.   Sending her home to her mom's is not a punishment.", "At least do less days with them both, just 1 day instead of 3 might be better. Subjecting Lauren to Elena seems cruel.", "So you want Lauren to end up with an eating disorder?", "But in the first post he said his house was on his exes way home from work. \ud83e\udd14", "Sounds like she\u2019s probably as miserable at her mothers house as she is at her dads \u2026Maybe mom should have sent an Uber", "But you said she was already driving home from work. so, she likely would have driven under the same conditions, regardless if she were picking up Elena.", "So was she just never going to go home that day? You said that your house was on her route home. Sounds like it's pretty clear where your daughter learned her manipulative techniques.", "She's 14, next time order an uber.  Or you could have driven her home.", "Info: was she already driving or was she arranging an alternative way home prior to your \"insistence\"?", "INFO: So, what does she know that she shouldn't know? There is more to this than bullying her sister just because she can. This comment alone said she doesn't bully anyone else but her sister. There's more to this story. Yes, teens can be AHs just to be AHs but there I'd a reason she is deliberately targeting her sister.", "She absolutely does. What kind of punishment is she getting?", "THIS!", "But therapy alone - do you go to sessions with her. Where you both speak and challenge her on her beliefs? Obviously individual therapy doesnt work.\n\nAlso just separate them. You are forcing two people together who dont need to be."]}
