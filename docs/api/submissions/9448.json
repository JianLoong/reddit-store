I am Scandinavian and grew up there (pertinent for later) but currently live in Colorado. I like to think that I have settled pretty well into American culture and customs as an immigrant and I generally navigate things pretty easily and love following politics. There are however specific cultural things I refuse to give up on doing like cultural holidays, specific foods and various traditions. One of those traditions is that people never ever wear shoes inside the house. Wearing outdoor shoes inside, be it your own home or someone else\u00b4s, is seen as a massive sign of disrespect (aside from just making the floors filthy). It\u00b4s one thing I won\u00b4t negate on, I don\u00b4t want people wearing shoes inside my home (indoor slippers only).\n\nI just moved in with my boyfriend of one year who is American. He is very lovely and has been understanding and supportive of me being an immigrant and me wanting to keep specific traditions. However, we have argued more than I would like about whether to wear shoes inside the house or not. I tell him absolutely not as it\u00b4s me that cleans the floors (he handles the cooking instead) and that it both makes the floors dirty and I find it disrespectful. He argues back that it\u00b4s no big deal as we can always clean the floors and he does not see the point of doing it when most people don\u00b4t anyway. We have still not entirely resolved this.\n\nThings recently came to a head when 6 of his friends came to visit our new place for the first time and I knew the floors would get dirty with 6 people going around in outdoor shoes. When they came, I greeted them and told them to please to take their shoes off, joking that this was a \u00b4Scandinavian\u00b4 household where we take off our shoes or the trolls will come to get them. I then went out for the night.\n\nWhen I got back his friends were gone but my boyfriend was frosty. He told me I had undermined him in front of his friends by insisting they take their shoes off like they were kids. I argued back that I had done it jokingly but also it was important to me people respect the rule. We have stopped discussing the issue but things are still a bit frosty between us.\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting people don\u00b4t wear shoes inside our home? I know I need to adjust as an immigrant but I don\u00b4t like feeling disrespected either or throwing away customs important to me, just because I am immigrant. I also wonder about this as we have been discussing having children and I am determined any future children we have will be raised with values and culture from my home.\n\nNB - using a throwaway account. I am Lutheran but this is not for religious reasons but cultural if that helps.

Bringing stuff in from the outside is gross and cleaning floors constantly is a pain. Also, wait til you have a crawling baby that face plants and eats stuff off the floor. \n\nBut also plenty of valid reasons why people want to wear shoes indoors. You need to find out real reason he wants shoes on indoors. Does he struggle to take shoes off? Does his feet hurt walking bare foot? Is he a germaphobe and doesn\u2019t want to touch his shoes? Does he think feet are gross and doesn\u2019t want it touching his floors? Does he think feet look disgusting? Is he worried about people\u2019s smelly feet? Does he have a foot fetish and doesn\u2019t want to be aroused by people he knows? Is he non confrontational and finds it awkward to ask people to take their shoes off?\n\nIf it\u2019s true that he simply thinks shoes indoors is no big deal, then you take on one of his chores and he takes over the chore of cleaning the floors. But you both need come to an agreement of how often he needs to clean the floors for you to feel comfortable that outdoor shoes inside is okay. Or split the cost of a robot vac/mop and schedule it to clean every day. \n\nYou\u2019re both adults and need to find a compromise. There\u2019s so many solutions besides just yelling at each other. \n\nGet him proper shoes that he wears indoor only. Make the shoe removal area nice by providing shoe storage, seating, deodoriser and hand sanitizer. Put a funny sign up or funny welcome mat about being a shoe free house to remove confrontation. Offer guests indoor slippers/socks.

Well that\u2019s not a guest now is it pew pew", "Canadian here, and we ask people to remove their shoes in our house because it's gross to track salt, dirt, mud, and who knows what else in. We have a box of assorted sizes of slippers at the front door for those who want them. My MIL brings slippers with her when she visits because she always has. I've also been to events and other people's houses where they prefer you to keep your shoes on because of x, y, z. Ok, NBD. I also work in a cozy little office where we ask clients to remove shoes at the door in the winter to protect the carpet from salt, (in the summer it's fine to keep shoes on) and we provide slippers for them too. It's different everywhere and he shouldn't be getting so worked up. NTA.", "Imagine the stuff that's on streets and the sheer amount of germs being carried into the house with it. You are NTA. The first time I watched an American sitcom and saw a character lie down on someone's bed with their shoes on I freaked out. This isn't just about customs. It's also about hygeine. Definitely NTA. I'd reconsider this arrangement. Values need to align for long term success in anything.", "People get so emotional about this topic! In my humble opinion, the etiquette of shoes on or off is situational. So, NTA but figure out hiw to compromise on this issue with your boyfriend.\n\nIn my humble opinion, if you are hosting a formal or semi-formal event where there are many people who don't know each other well or at all, it's impolite to expect them to go around in stocking feet. Socks are worn for much the same reason that people wear underwear/undershirts and that is partially to catch sweat and odors. Also many people attending a more formal event will wear specific shoes to match the outfit.\n\nIf you see hosting close friends/family casually, shoes off is a perfectly valid request. That being said people may be embarrassed to take their shoes off for a variety of reasons. I also truly don't understand some people's visceral reaction to \"outdoor\" shoes worn inside. Unless someone literally walked through mud or shit, their shoes are clean enough. If someone has gone through mud or say, snow, then it would be impolite for the wearer to bring the shoes indoors. If you invite someone over and don't clear mud/snow/whatever from your walkway first, that's kinda on you.\n\nPoint is etiquette is situation dependent.", "Two words: Shoe covers.\n\nYou can get them on Amazon, ask your guests to wear them if they don't want to remove their shoes.\n\nPeople have valid reasons to want to keep their shoes on; so they are N T A to want to keep wearing them.

And for guests, a box of booties/shoe covers?

I find it\u2019s hard on my feet and back to walk around barefoot.  Socks and soft slippers don\u2019t cut it.  At home, I do have hard soled slippers that I\u2019ll wear.  I also don\u2019t always wear socks and the thought of being barefoot really creeps me out - both as a guest and host! I\u2019d rather have someone\u2019s shoes on my floor than their bare feet.  I do take shoes off when people ask, and try to remember to bring socks to slip on.  But if other people leave shoes on or the host says it\u2019s fine - I\u2019m keeping them on!", "Shoes track in dirt,  dirt makes house dirty, pretty simple.

I think this is fairly common, but not unreasonable.\n\nHowever, I can say this is not something I ever did growing up. My parents never asked people to remove their shoes, and I took mine off for comfort more than anything else.\n\nThese days it's a little problematic for me personally, because I have to wear orthotic insoles and the doctor recommends I wear them whenever I'm \"load-bearing\" (great term to hear from your doctor \ud83d\ude1b). At home I do have indoor and outdoor shoes, although I occasionally I have to wear the indoor ones outdoors. I would do it if someone asked me to, but I'd probably also try to carry some slipons or something, because my feet get cold and uncomfortable without shoes for too long. I also doubt this is a widespread issue for people.", "NTA your home, your rules! His friends have their rules in their homes, you have your rules.

My family didn't do this, I started when I moved out on my own. I think it's nasty to walk around indoors with shoes that have walked city streets or on roads and yards with animal poop or dirt. When I had babies I got even more strict about it. NTA", "NAH.   Taking shoes off inside is a preference, not a moral imperative.   There are pros and cons to the practice and reaaonable people can disagree. While people taking off shoes prevents dirt getting on the floor, it allows sweaty nasty feet or socks to get on the floor(which\n is in my view is much worse btw).

Even in the states, it isn't unheard of. I'm 100% born and raised in the US. We didn't have this rule as a kid because we didn't have a decent entry to apply such a rule. However, as we got older and things changed so did we. I have the same rule, I have littles and honestly I don't have the time to make sure my floors are always clean and debris from shoes isn't one more thing I need to be added to my list.

My house is shoe free as well. In winter it\u2019s slushy and salty and in summer it\u2019s either muddy or dusty. Who wants that wearing down the carpet or hardwood floor finish? Plus, SO MANY dogs in Colorado, there\u2019s bound to be poop. \n\nI do make two exceptions: my sister has a medical condition that prevents her from going barefoot so she gets a pass, and if I\u2019m having a large non-family group over (10+ people) I just let folks wear shoes and clean the floors well afterwards because there\u2019s not really enough space by the front door for that many people doffing and donning shoes (unless it\u2019s wet out, then all shoes off).  About half of my friends here also remove their shoes at home. You\u2019re definitely not out of the ordinary with your expectation.", "Yeah, I am American and my family wasn't super strict about shoes inside when I was a kid (although other people's families were, and if visiting a friend it was normal to ask if they wanted me to take off my shoes!) but when I got older and started living in college dorms during the winter it became a necessity and now it's just habit. I don't think it's weird or outside the cultural norm for people in the US to want shoes off indoors.", "Yeah I\u2019m Canadian and no one is coming into my place with their shoes on.

It's not a respect thing here but a sanitary decision. You never know what's on the bottom of your shoes - especially when it comes to gross little boys.

It's a normal thing to do, and your bf needs to get off his high horse", "> I guess it must just be a thing where there's snow\n\nThat's another part of this that's weird to me - I recognize Colorado is midwestern and a fair bit of it is actually plains, but a huge part of it is also in the Rocky Mountains, so this feels like it shouldn't be that unheard of?", "From yet another fellow shoe-free household, you might consider getting a pile of cheap slippers for guests.

We all take off shoes.  As for workmen - sometimes they are wearing steel toed shoes that are required for safety and if that's the case then I'd recommend groundcloth be put down if they are there for a while or those little bootie covers if they won't be there long or will be going all over the house (like an inspection or something).", "They don\u2019t take their shoes off on TV because it puts a pause in the plot/dialogue, not because it\u2019s actual practice. I have yet to go to a house where they wore shoes inside with the exception of parties on occasion where they just deep clean floors after a large gathering. \n\nAlso, most tradesmen that come to my home have shoe covers with them to put on before walking through my home.

I\u2019m from Colorado and in the town where I grew up, taking your shoes off when going into somebody\u2019s house was absolutely the norm.

Not wearing shoes in the house is not nearly as odd of a concept as they are making it out to be.", "Same here, I literally don't know anyone who wears their shoes in the house.

I know it\u2019s really hard to straddle two worlds; it feels a lot like being a boat that doesn\u2019t have a port. That said, I would really encourage OP to not lose her sense of self.

Nobody has pristine shoes unless you're some hardcore sneaker collector with shoe covers to protect your $300 Nikes.
