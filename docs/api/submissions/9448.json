I am Scandinavian and grew up there (pertinent for later) but currently live in Colorado. I like to think that I have settled pretty well into American culture and customs as an immigrant and I generally navigate things pretty easily and love following politics. There are however specific cultural things I refuse to give up on doing like cultural holidays, specific foods and various traditions. One of those traditions is that people never ever wear shoes inside the house. Wearing outdoor shoes inside, be it your own home or someone else\u00b4s, is seen as a massive sign of disrespect (aside from just making the floors filthy). It\u00b4s one thing I won\u00b4t negate on, I don\u00b4t want people wearing shoes inside my home (indoor slippers only).\n\nI just moved in with my boyfriend of one year who is American. He is very lovely and has been understanding and supportive of me being an immigrant and me wanting to keep specific traditions. However, we have argued more than I would like about whether to wear shoes inside the house or not. I tell him absolutely not as it\u00b4s me that cleans the floors (he handles the cooking instead) and that it both makes the floors dirty and I find it disrespectful. He argues back that it\u00b4s no big deal as we can always clean the floors and he does not see the point of doing it when most people don\u00b4t anyway. We have still not entirely resolved this.\n\nThings recently came to a head when 6 of his friends came to visit our new place for the first time and I knew the floors would get dirty with 6 people going around in outdoor shoes. When they came, I greeted them and told them to please to take their shoes off, joking that this was a \u00b4Scandinavian\u00b4 household where we take off our shoes or the trolls will come to get them. I then went out for the night.\n\nWhen I got back his friends were gone but my boyfriend was frosty. He told me I had undermined him in front of his friends by insisting they take their shoes off like they were kids. I argued back that I had done it jokingly but also it was important to me people respect the rule. We have stopped discussing the issue but things are still a bit frosty between us.\n\nAm I the asshole for insisting people don\u00b4t wear shoes inside our home? I know I need to adjust as an immigrant but I don\u00b4t like feeling disrespected either or throwing away customs important to me, just because I am immigrant. I also wonder about this as we have been discussing having children and I am determined any future children we have will be raised with values and culture from my home.\n\nNB - using a throwaway account. I am Lutheran but this is not for religious reasons but cultural if that helps.

Bringing stuff in from the outside is gross and cleaning floors constantly is a pain. Also, wait til you have a crawling baby that face plants and eats stuff off the floor. \n\nBut also plenty of valid reasons why people want to wear shoes indoors. You need to find out real reason he wants shoes on indoors. Does he struggle to take shoes off? Does his feet hurt walking bare foot? Is he a germaphobe and doesn\u2019t want to touch his shoes? Does he think feet are gross and doesn\u2019t want it touching his floors? Does he think feet look disgusting? Is he worried about people\u2019s smelly feet? Does he have a foot fetish and doesn\u2019t want to be aroused by people he knows? Is he non confrontational and finds it awkward to ask people to take their shoes off?\n\nIf it\u2019s true that he simply thinks shoes indoors is no big deal, then you take on one of his chores and he takes over the chore of cleaning the floors. But you both need come to an agreement of how often he needs to clean the floors for you to feel comfortable that outdoor shoes inside is okay. Or split the cost of a robot vac/mop and schedule it to clean every day. \n\nYou\u2019re both adults and need to find a compromise. There\u2019s so many solutions besides just yelling at each other. \n\nGet him proper shoes that he wears indoor only. Make the shoe removal area nice by providing shoe storage, seating, deodoriser and hand sanitizer. Put a funny sign up or funny welcome mat about being a shoe free house to remove confrontation. Offer guests indoor slippers/socks.

I\u2019m Asian-American (many people of my culture don\u2019t wear shoes inside) and I prefer not to have outdoor shoes worn inside my home.

In that country people typically do NOT take off their shoes at the door.\n\nBut I have an aunt who asks people to do so.\n\nIt's a total nonevent.

I cannot imagine being offended by someone asking me to take my shoes off. They shouldn't even need to ask! Especially as someone who lives somewhere with winter snow and spring mud, leaving your shoes on is just disgusting and a great way to ruin peoples floors and carpets by dragging water and mud around, grinding gravel and rocks into the floorboards.

Because you've got weird hypotheticals about holey socks and foot reveal hangups?", "If I invite someone into my home, request they remove their shoes, and they refuse, I'm going to think they value their socks more than my home.

I'm only repeating what half of the older people i know say when you don't take your shoes off coming in to their house lmao.

He never celebrated your cultural holidays before he met you but he's fine with doing that now?\n\nDoes your boyfriend urinate while standing as well?

People are tracking in mud, shit, loogies, rocks to scratch your floor, gum, dirt, water, etc. They don't have to clean it so they don't care. Additionally they already wear shoes in the house so they don't have incentive to clean it even if they are on cleaning duty.\n\nPeople who say \"guests should feel comfortable in your home\" are probably the same type of people I wouldn't want in my house. So if they spill a cup of milk all over my floor, they'll just sit back and relax and watch me clean it up because they \"should feel comfortable\"? Should I let them spit loogies and piss on my floor too? Same thing with the shoes. They're bringing in a ton of shit from outside onto my floor. The only difference is they don't see me clean it up until they leave. Yes, I should do my best to make guests feel comfortable but guests should also not actively make my home a mess.\n\nNTA.
