My friend  is fully Chinese. We are both good friends at we met each other in the same math class and attend the same school.   \n\n\nSometimes, I call my friend \"Dog eater\" because that is an inside joke between us when we insult each other. I don't call that to anyone else except him and he doesn't mind. Last week, this girl who's fully white came up to me and said \"Hey, I heard you say dog eater to Wanwan(my friend) and you may not realize it but it's really offensive\" At first I was kind of shocked because I thought everyone knew I was also Chinese but considering that we were a different grade, I decided to explain to her that I'm also half Chinese and Wanwan don't mind. I tried to be as polite as possible.  \n\n\nYesterday we were having our little no-harm verbal fight as usual when I said \"Okay, dog eater\" and I think the girl must've heard us again but this time she kind of got between us and said \"Can you stop being racist?! I'm gonna report you to the teacher.\" Wanwan said he's fine and stop not tell the teachers because there will be more problems than this and that this is a joke. He also tried to explain that he's not offended and that I'm also Chinese. She said back to him \"Why are you as a Chinese person, accepting an RCTA just because they're your friend?\" For those people who don't know RCTA is Race Change To Another where many people turn into East Asian just because of the aesthetics that's been quite popular in TikTok where people share their journey to turn \"Asian\". Obviously I don't support this but I said back \"I'm very clearly Chinese, I can speak fluent Mandarin and even though I have more white genes, that doesn't prove that I'm not Chinese.\" She ended up getting into a fight about how I'm delusional and to stop fetishizing Asian people.   \n\n\nI think she's silly but still, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697775851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17c2o6h/aita_for_being_racist_to_my_own_race/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
