He came to me and said he had a ONS and she\u2019s pregnant, due March. Now this is fine, not much we can do about it now, they are going to try and be a couple. Me and my ex have children together and he announced they are going to use our daughters middle name for their new daughters first name. I\u2019m upset at this and think they should choose a different name, he said the other woman really likes the name but there is no significance as to why she wants this name. I\u2019ve tried to get them to see if from my POV but they say I\u2019m overreacting and lots of people have the name. It is a common name but I\u2019m more upset because she said she likes it after he mentioned it was our daughter\u2019s middle name. I wouldn\u2019t mind if they used it as a middle name but find it odd she would want a name i chose for my daughter with him. AITA for asking them to think of any other name except one my children already have.\n\nEDIT: \n\nmy ex and his girlfriend do not live together and unlikely will when the child is born. Neither can afford to. He has said DNA test will be done, not sure I believe this. \n\nour children asked if they had thought of a name and he said they had decided to call the child grace. our daughter walked out and said it\u2019s weird (she\u2019s 8). I have reservations because it\u2019s a name we decided on together. he doesn\u2019t want to discuss it anymore as she is set on the name and he doesn\u2019t want to upset her  \n\nI am a little concerned with how things are going considering the outcome of the relationship, she did seem keen to have her family move in with him and to change job/school where she would overlap with my family/friends. My ex has said no to this. I\u2019m more concerned for him and my children than my own feelings. it sucks he\u2019s having another kids but it is what it is And we are making the best of it.

Please don't let your anger damage their relationship with her.", "NTA especially since your child expressed disinterest as well. Let your ex build this bridge himself. You shared your opinion fall back and ignore. Honestly his relationship and the new child have nothing to do with you. It will be his job to have his children communicate with each other.

HOWEVER, it\u2019s a middle name, and she\u2019s being named after her older half sister.

His first son\u2019s middle name is my dad\u2019s first name. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it\u2019s sweet! That just my honest opinion.

This is more of a reminder of OP\u2019s daughter, who will be the half-sister of the new baby. I don\u2019t get the big deal here. I have the same middle name as my half-sister. As long as this woman isn\u2019t acting in other ways that indicate she\u2019s trying to exclude or replace OP\u2019s daughter I don\u2019t really get the issue.", "This is such a weird take. Everyone\u2019s acting like they\u2019re trying to replace OP\u2019s daughter. This baby won\u2019t be a stranger, it\u2019s going to be her half sister\u2026", "I mean, they might be happy. Seems kinda odd that you're assuming their happiness comes from a place of delusion.", "The daughter is pretty upset about it. It's abhorrent that the father and his new baby momma aren't taking this girl's feelings into account over this.

It makes sense OP is upset by it, too.", "There are two brothers in the NFL with the same thing. Dalvin James Cook and James Dalvin Cook. Literally no one cares.

My uncle is James Paul.\nApparently, there were only 3 names to choose from in my family, lol.", "And your point is? Hollywood stars are noted for their weird behaviour.

Btw. I am known by my middle name.", "Do you live in the USA?", "Mostly fake, yeah. \n\nMiddle names mostly do not matter. In your specific instance, as someone who goes by their middle name, it's your first name that doesn't matter. \n\nFamily name, and name that everyone casually calls you. Those matter. \n\nThe third name? Largely superfluous.", "No, I'm European. But I do have quite a lot of friends and business acquaintances in America. And at least one of them shares a name in one way or another with a sibling. Just because something isn't quite the done thing in your area doesn't mean it doesn't happen. The world is a whole big place, and America is not the centre of it for quite a few billion people. Shocking, I know.", "But my first name is on all official documents.  So it does matter. I do wonder why my parents decided to do that and even though I\u2019ve met a few people who use their middle name I find that weird. Ie parents giving their child 2 names and using the second one. Maybe I\u2019m scarred for life from it.", "Oh I know. I\u2019m  European as well. I can say I\u2019ve never met anyone who shares a middle or first name with a sibling. There\u2019s plenty of names out there to choose from. Shocking isn\u2019t it."]}
