When she asked to move in I told her yes but that I wanted her to keep in mind that she\u2019s allergic to my cat. She said she\u2019d keep her door closed and take allergy medicine. Well we are a month in with her living with me and she keeps hinting to me that I should take my cat to the shelter, I always laugh and tell her she\u2019s absolutely nuts. But last night she flipped on me and said if I cherish our friendship that I\u2019d do whatever I had to do to keep her comfortable in OUR home. I told her this is my cat, kids and I\u2019s home and if she had a problem she can leave.

She could very well take it down the street or into another neighborhood and leave it there.", "Clearly a person who is allergic to cats shouldn't be availing herself of the great generosity of her friend who has a beloved family cat in her home by trying to live there.  The notion that the person with the allergies gets to tell her generous host to deep-six the cat is both cruel and self-important beyond what is even vaguely acceptable.\n\nYour friend is a grown-up, presumably capable of working and taking care of her basic needs including housing somewhere that doesn't have a cat.\n\nI myself wouldn't cherish a friendship with someone who tried to guilt-trip me into getting rid of the cat my children and I had adored for years.

It sounds like she has no plan on leaving and is trying to take advantage of you for a place to live.\n\nedit: oh, NTA obviously", "NTA - what an ingrate. I\u2019d be worried she will do something to your cat. Kick her out.", "NTA - she is a temporary resident, cat is a permanent one. She's been there a month.

But get your cat chipped because she may just take it to the shelter herself and pretend cat got out. \n\nPoint out if she cherished your friendship, she wouldn't be asking you to give up a loved member of your family. I think she is way too comfortable with a long, rent-free stay but check your local residency laws.", "NTA - The cat is a resident family member, your \"friend\" is a freeloader who you kindly took in. The freeloader goes first.", "Absolutely NTA! Do not leave this person alone with your cat!", "NTA. Please have her move somewhere else as I am afraid you will come home to no cat. She has NO right to ask you to get rid of a pet.", "NTA. Take her to a shelter.\n\nIt's the cat's home, not hers.\n\nHisssssss.", "NTA.

Tell her to find another place before she establishes tenancy and it might be difficult to evict her if she puts up a fight.", "NTA and be extremely careful with her around your cat.

Anyone who can suggest this needs to be gone from your house asap. Pets are our family and she is obviously not even a friend if she can suggest this.", "NTA. It's your home. Your family. Your pets. She knew there was a cat. Knew she was allergic. You're trying to help her out. It's ridiculous to expect a person to get rid of their pet for doing them a favor.", "NTA. Sounds like it's time for your entitled friend to move out.", "NTA. Its your home and your cat's home. She knew the situation when she moved in. Time for her to find another place to live, pronto.", "NTA\u2026.I would not leave her alone with kitty as it might go missing", "NTA\n\nThat is YOUR cat's home. Anyone demanding to get rid of a pet can fuck right off, and keep on fucking off", "NTA, and take care of your cat. I won't be surprised if one day the cat mysteriously ran away or something like that. I'm afraid to say that only one can stay, your cat or your friend. The other must leave asap.", "Hell no ur not!", "NTA.\n\nA. Kitty was there first. \n\nB. Your friend is capable of getting her own place, Kitty isn't.

Sounds like friend needs new living arrangements!", "NTA-  I'm severely allergic to dogs.  To the point that some of my good friends have seen accidental exposures and don't allow me in their homes.  I would never ask them to get rid of their dogs for me.  It would be one thing if you got the cat after she moved in, but you didn't, you already had the cat and you told her it might be an issue.", "Pets are family, and you don\u2019t take family to a shelter.", "NTA the cat was there first and can't fend for itself. You are doing your friend a FAVOR and if they can't handle the cat they can find alternative arrangements for housing. \n\nA true friend would NEVER ask you to abandon your pet. So it's pretty clear here who cherishes the friendship and who doesn't. She's using you and acting entitled, not acting like a friend.", "NTA. Kick her out and make sure she doesn't do anything to your cat.", "NTA. Tell her the cat\u2019s complained and has suggested she go to a shelter.", "Have you tried Purina\u2019s anti-allergy food?  I keep my girl on it and give her monthly baths;  we\u2019ve been able to avoid allergic reactions with anyone (I also keep allergy meds on hand).
