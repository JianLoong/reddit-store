Long time I didn\u2019t hear anything about who\u2019ll become best man. After a joke about it it was really quiet between my brother and his fianc\u00e9. This year, April first, I got invited into a messenger group about his bachelorparty with the text from the other guy saying that after he became his best man, he thought to make the group to organize the party. I thought it was a April fool bc my brother knows how important it is to me to be a best men once. It wasn\u2019t. So he started organizing it way too late and asked us if it would be fine to go camping. I didn\u2019t say anything in the beginning. My brother hates camping. I told the best man a little later. He didn\u2019t care. Once it was time to get the beer he asks us what WE want to drink and everyone said that they wanted to have Pilsener beer. I told him that he ONLY drinks a specific brand beer. He bought his least favorite. A few days before the party it turned out that he didn\u2019t even organize a place to camp or even a tent. So I said that it would be the best to get a RV but he didn\u2019t want to. He also didn\u2019t organize enough motorbikes for everyone so that my bf and I have to ride together on one for the whole day. Also he didn\u2019t make any reservation for the other activities were planing on doing. The whole day is planned for good weather but it\u2019s going to be a thunderstorm that day. So am I the asshole for not telling him or his fianc\u00e9e that his best man is going to ruin his bachelor party?", "created_utc": 1691783079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15oil5r/aita_for_not_intervening_my_brothers_bachelorparty/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not the Best Man.\n\nYou wanted the Best man how many times about your brother's tastes.

Op is not in charge, so beyond making his opinions/information known, has no further responsibility.", "Yep and op can sit back and watch the s**t show! We all make our choices!", "That's his brother's karma. The way OP is behaving is his. Justifying bad behavior because someone else did something crappy too is immature and juvenile.", "Just like OP is going to sit back and watch and important event for his brother ruined because he didn't get picked.  Oversight doesn't equal malicious.  The brother isn't obligated to make OP the best man at HIS wedding.  That isn't malicious it's not like he was trying to upset OP.  HOWEVER what OP is doing is 100% malicious.", "That seems like an odd idea of malicious. Malicious would be not informing the party runner about brother's dislike of camping and beer brand.", "Knowing that your brother is going to hate the event and not telling him because you didn't get picked as best man sounds pretty malicious to me."]}
