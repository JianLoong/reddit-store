That\u2019s like gifting someone deodorant or toothpaste for Christmas. Cmon, don\u2019t let this family make you question what she meant by that gift.\n\nAlso, your bf needs to stand up to his mom. That was a wildly inappropriate thing to do. Honestly, this should have been nipped in the bud when she made the first comment about your weight, it\u2019s definitely not her place. If he can\u2019t stand up to her about something this blatant, expect this situation to exacerbate in the coming years. That lady will insert her opinion at every given chance if dude doesn\u2019t start establishing some MUCH NEEDED boundaries.", "NTA - even if she's the dream Future MIL, I don't think it's ever cool to gift someone something like that. \n\nAs far as throwing it away, it's not a loving, thoughtful gift - and once it was given to you it's yours to do with what you choose. \n\nThe only way you're in the wrong here is if BFM said \"OP, I've been where you are and sometimes struggled with my confidence because of it - here's something that might make you feel a little better out and about, but no worries if you don't want to use it - this brand helped me so I wanted to get one for you.\" \n\nAnd even that's still a little uncool.", "NTA\n\nShe's body shaming you and trying to disguise it with a girdle? F that! If you were too thin in her opinion, she'd probably be giving you food! \n\nYour bf must tell his mom to back off. This isn't HER relationship. It's YOUR relationship with her son.", "She WHAT. I'm literally spluttering, she. bought. you. a. girdle. Rude, presumptous, and bizarre. What in the evil matriarch in a Jane Austen novel is this. At no point in history was this an okay gift to give to your son's romantic interest. Do not apologize for getting rid of it, you've been far more courteous than she deserves already. Your boyfriend needs to understand this. If she keeps up the uninvited commentary I'd advise you call her on it, you deserve better.\n\nNTA", "It was not only an insulting gift, but presumptuous and demeaning.  No, you should not keep a gift like that for any reason, and if the person giving such a gift lacks all self-awareness to understand why it was an inappropriate gift, you are doing them a huge favor in telling them so, as you may hopefully cause them to pause the next time they might do something so baselessly tacky.", "NTA and also your boyfriend needs to have your back on this and tell his mom it was an inappropriate gift.", "NTA. Get her a basket as a gift, tell her it\u2019s to gather up her opinions and gifts and keep them to herself.", "The gift, her invasion of your privacy asking about underwear you are wearing, her absolute disregard of your boundaries and autonomy solely based of her judgement of your body shape is outrageous. You are NTA here. Boyfriend should intervene and get his mother in line. I would say just one thing. No more discussion of my body or appearance. If she cannot respect that,she can stay home.", "NTA. As a gift, it's yours to do as you wish. You don't ever have to wear it and you don't have to keep it.\n\nAs an insult, you're an adult: you don't have to accept unsolicited advice. When she checked that you're wearing it, you needed to give her a polite form of \"none of your business.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You should have refused to accept it. It is an insulting \"gift\", and your weight is none of her business.", "NTA.  I would tell your boyfriend\u2019s mom to stop commenting on your body.", "God NTA.    Those things are torture. I was bought one for my 2nd wedding with the suggestion that it might help.  I lasted 5 minutes in it.  This thing was bra to thighs with about 200 catches to do up. \n\n Plus whatever you are \" girdling\" has to ooze out somewhere else right?", "NTA I don\u2019t think your bfs mom has any right to make comments about your weight or give you advice/ gifts in regards to it. \n\nI think you should have stopped things long before passive aggressively telling her you threw out her \u201cgift\u201d but your bf should definitely have your back in defending you.", "NTA. It was given to you with ill intentions. It was meant to insult you the same way she does when she makes those comments about your weight. Your boyfriend more than likely knows that. He's just too scared to stand up to his mother. That does  not bode well for your relationship.", "NTA.\n\nOP, does bf's mom have a daughter? If so, do you know what their relationship is like?\n\nShe could have gifted you a number of health or nutrition oriented items/subscriptions but chose not to. Her choice of gift sends the shallow message that she is concerned solely with how you look, not your health. \n\nPlus, she's of the mind that you should place yourself in discomfort to make yourself more pleasing to her eyes. You were right to throw it in the trash and kind enough not to throw it in her face the next time you saw her.", "Nta. Thats not a gift. Its an insult. Id give her toothpaste and call to check if shes using it and tell her to use it.", "Gift her a book on how to treat people with respect", "One year for Christmas my dad's mom gave my mom a bottle of shampoo.\n\nThe next year she gave my mom a bar of soap. \n\nMy mom said, \"Hey, lets not give each other gifts anymore.\" \n\nTotally agree, this is a ridiculously rude gift to give someone.", "Right? The gall of this woman!!  And bf should have shut her down.  No way should he allow his mom around if she is talking this way and the \u201cgift\u201d was a slap in the face! NTA", "Hear hear. NTA. WTF? The nerve of some people, wow."]}
