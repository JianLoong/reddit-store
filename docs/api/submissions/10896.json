You taught her that she can get her way by crying and having a fit and that you are a cruel lying manipulator.

You let her bring a favorite toy, and like any 6 year old she lost track of it. So you, a grown adult, decided to play a really cruel trick on a little kid. Then, when you saw how devastated she was, you kept it up. Then you blame her mother for the tantrums. That is not the way to go.\n\nSet limits from the beginning. If it is no toys, that is fine. Don't allow a tantrum to be an excuse not to parent. Don't blame her mother for you and her father's poor parenting at your house. I get that you (and hopefully her father) are really young. There are all kinds of good parenting books and websites that can help you without breaking the heart of a little kid.", "YTA - For giving in to her tantrum in the first place. Going to throw a hissy fit? Consequences, not capitulation.", "Going to the park should be a treat that she only gets to do if she\u2019s good. The moment she acted up and threw a tantrum about not being allowed to bring a toy, should be the moment she was given a time out and the trip to the park cancelled until her behaviour improved.\n\nYou may well have taught her a lesson, but it may not be the one you intended. What she learned today was \u201cif I continue to scream and throw a tantrum, I\u2019ll get what I want\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t trust my parents to not play cruel tricks on me\u201d \n\nYTA", "YTA but you would not be the asshole if you set a rule of not bringing certain toys and then stuck to that rule while she threw a fit. Keep throwing a fit and no park. What people here don't understand is that the distress of that is much greater than the distress caused by your attempt at teaching a lesson. While i don't agree with you holding on to the toy for more than a minute or so, i understand and know what it is like to have a child prone to throwing fits and why you would think this is a better solution than having skip the park and throwing a fit all day long. However, imo sticking to your original boundaries while more distressful will have a better long-term outcome even if it will take a long time for your child to realize fits won't get her what she wants and that period before she realizes will be hell.", "NTA. The lesson needed to be learned before that or any other toy or special item was lost. 10 minutes might have been a bit long for her age but no harm done in the end. \n\nYou tried to talk her out of taking the toy the relented with the condition that she be responsible and she wasn't.

No one else's opinion matters. \n\nHowever, I do think it is time that all three of you put your foot down and say no more toys to the park, period.", "YTA. This is how one of my parents parented me and my sibling, the end result wasn't pretty and neither of us ever forgot those sorts of \"lessons\". \n\nIf she forgets her toys, don't let her bring them. If she throws a tantrum, don't bring her to the park. If she doesn't learn her lesson, maybe seek professional help for advice on how to address this situation. If you don't find a way to stop this behavior young, it will only get worse. \n\nAlso, never create a situation where innocent bystanders have to pay for your parenting decision (i.e. little kids being harassed by your step daughter over your actions).", "YTA. Yeah, kids drop stuff, leave stuff. You're the adult parent who's meant to help her, pick stuff up, remember stuff. Hiding it is only going to cause her to not trust you. What was your game plan here?\n\nYou are heading for disaster, have you ever heard of the boy who cried wolf!? You know, the lesson we teach our kids. When she does actually lose something precious to her she's going to think you have it! I imagine if she kicks off about taking something to the park you're going to be in for one hell of a time.

POOR KID", "NTA\n\n\nSometimes you have to learn lessons.\n\n\nDon't let these people on here tell you different.  You didn't let her go a day, you didn't pretend to leave her at the house when she had her tantrum.\n\n\nYour in laws want you to enable her entitled behavior.

You could have said to the six year old, \"Honey, you set your toy down. Do you want us to hold it and keep it safe while you play with other kids?\" Instead you caused your kid distress. YTA.

Your child would\u2019ve been inconsolable. Personally I feel like this is a good way to teach a child a lesson, in the end nobody was hurt and hopefully your step daughter has learned her lesson.

Good for you. \n\nThat's not teaching her a lesson about losing things. That's just teaching her that it's OK to steal, lie, and trick people just because you think that you have a good reason.  \n\nTrust me. Once, she really loses a toy. She will learn very fast to keep them safe.", "YTA she will only learn that's it's ok to steal and lie.", "I wuld do the same", "YTA that was a dirty trick, and you are heartless.

Big difference.", "YTA. Letting her melt down thinking she lost her toy when you had it the whole time is, like, a weirdly vindictive thing to do to a six year old. She's six! If she's being careless with her things and she loses the toy, that's a direct consequence of her actions, and she has nobody to blame but herself. But now all she knows is that you lied to her and hid her favorite toy for... what? She's six. She's not going to understand the point you were trying to make. Especially since you gave in to what she wanted in the end. \n\nWhatever her overall problems may be, this isn't going to make her stop having tantrums. Especially not if she's still having those behaviors reinforced by other adults. Shit like this isn't going to do anything except make her upset and confused, because the adults in her life are all teaching her entirely different things and she doesn't know how to parse all of these conflicting ideas she's getting. Because she's six years old.", "YTA. You played a cruel \u201ctrick\u201d on a six year old to teach her a lesson.\n\nShe will not trust you now. Great job.", "NTA. Teaching kids stuff takes a lot of time and patience. It\u2019s going to get ugly. The best news is that you dad and mom are on the same page.", "She's 6 and I know you want her to 'learn a lesson', but a better way to have done it was to enforce the no-toys rule instead of causing her unnecessary distress over her favorite toy. \n\nYTA", "YTA; bro she's six. More likely she's gonna remember how you made her feel/cry rather than the \"lesson\".", "YTA\n\nThere are other ways to correct Rose's behavior, including calling her over, to speak to her privately, and telling her she needs to put away her toy while she goes off and does something else. Making her afraid she lost her toy was cruel. She is only 6-years-old. That might seem big to you right now, because your little one is a toddler, but it truly isn't all that big.\n\nYou're pretty young, yourself. Maybe you should just let her father handle this stuff. And tell him and Rose's mother, that you are going to let him handle this stuff. Then if Rose she ruins or loses a toy, that's their problem and responsibility.", "YTA. \n\nI know you want to teach her a lesson, but honestly at this age she\u2019s still to young to really grasp the message, she\u2019s only going to remember how you made her feel. How do you anticipate a six year old to watch over her toys?", "YTA. Either hold firm on not taking toys to public places, or let your kid bring them and keep an eye on the toy. I picked up my son's stuffed animal at least 3 times today at the grocery store when he dropped it out of the cart. They're little kids. Stop expecting them to act like adults.", "10 minutes? You sat and watched as she was distressed and lashing out for 10 minutes and think you did the right thing here? \n\nYTA. Learn to be an actual parent jfc. She's 6.

No park. \n\nThis situation should have been you or her father picking up her toy and telling her it was being out away for the rest of the trip. Tantrum? Ok time to go home. \n\nAnything is better that what you two did", "The issue causing her to have tantrums is that when she's at her mothers, she's rarely told no. She wasn't told no at our house until recently either. No wasn't in her vocabulary. Everything, down to food, what we watch, where we go to eat out, was all her choice to avoid tantrums, she was never made do what she didn't want to do. It wasn't until she started school and the teacher pointed out the issues that we copped on in our house, but no so much in the other house.", "It's funny because all evening, she's been putting her toys and books and whatever back exactly where they belong rather than leaving them where they don't belong", "This is not gaslighting, by definition it's something you do over a long period of time. This is called lying.", "This. OP could have said \u201csorry kid, you don\u2019t get to keep the toy with you.\u201d That would\u2019ve been an appropriate lesson.

Had it actually gone missing, there would be weeks of tears", "Normally, there's no toys at the park, and we rarely ever give into tantrums. \n\nI don't think it would've been kept so long if she wasn't being nasty to other kids or acting the way she was. There was a separate consequence for how she treated the other children since that's also an ongoing issue", "Our living situation at the moment (we're moving in 3 months), isn't exactly ideal for small children to run around and play. The inside of the house is small and could result in injury from playing in areas not designated for play, and the neighbourhood/street is covered in litter that could also result in injury. Taking them to the park tends to be the only outlet for their energy. Luckily, Rose has school during the week which helps with getting the energy out, but weekends really have no other option, so it's either the park or indoor play areas", "We did that. 4 separate times. She wanted to hold onto it, and also leave it down. She didn't want us having it, probably because we didn't want her bringing it in the first place", "Child is 6.

That\u2019s what they do. Why are you expecting her to behave like an adult", "I wouldn\u2019t tolerate any of that from a 2 year old. You can\u2019t address any of the issues without addressing the route which I am not going to guess at though I have some ideas.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you start with a child counsellor. They really work magic and will also enlighten you as to what you should and shouldn\u2019t be doing. \n\nChildren basically come out kind and good and it\u2019s our job to not ruin them. You need to back track to basic parenting, probably with help, before you try to teach any life lessons to the kid.", "Yea \u201cfunny\u201d she\u2019s learned you can\u2019t be trusted.

I\u2019m guessing by the way you keep making excuses in the comments, you don\u2019t care that everyone is telling you YTA. So, I\u2019m not even sure why you asked. She\u2019s only 6. I bet you won\u2019t do shit like this to your 18 mo. old when they\u2019re her age.", "Six year olds regularly forget things they\u2019re told. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s being a bad kid.

You caused her distress for *no reason*.", "But it hadn\u2019t gone missing. \n\nYou are punishing a child. \n\nDo you expect her to trust you and have a good relationship with you? You blew that it so.", "She thought one of the other kids took her toy because she never dreamed that her trusted step parent would do such a thing. You caused this mess and you let it drag on longer because you did not like her reaction. That is pathetic.", "She learned that nasty behavior somewhere. Her own stepmother is cruel to her.", "Then you tell her \u201cno\u201d and go put the toy in the car. You are the adult.", "Holding firm on what's being told no to is the solution. Trying to get her to understand why she's upset and to talk about her big feelings rather than screaming until shes sick, offering her a quiet space to calm down and regulate herself is what's normally done. At the start of our weeks, that doesn't work, and we're dealing with tantrums for the first two days non stop. By 3 three, she's a better behaved child. Day 4-7, no issues at all. We have her Friday to Friday every other week, and it's like this all the time. Every week. We've tried everything else.", "Hahahaha", "I expect her to behave like a 6 year old, but tantrums over not having microwave fries 4 days a week for dinner aren't on in our house, nor are tantrums over not being allowed in the babies crib/stroller/carseat, tantrums over not being allowed pull the cats tail, tantrums over not being allowed watch the TV for 7 hours straight or to be allowed play with an ipad all day on a school day.

It's not forgetting, same thing has been said by school teachers and childcare workers. She simply doesn't care because she never has rules or discipline in moms house, yet she comes to our house and there's rules, structure and consequences for poor behaviour. \n\nShe does try to push our buttons, and breaks every rule imaginable because she lnows she can get away with it in her mom house and trys to here, so she can get what she wants.", "This sub loves to blow things out of proportion. They did not punish a child, they tried to teach a valuable lesson which is a parents job. The child wasn\u2019t in danger and they got their toy back in the end. \n\nWhat OP did is much better than the toy actually being lost or stolen.", "Exactly. This negative behavior is a direct result of OP\u2019s actions.", "Tricking her at the park was not okay. \n\nThis will make her not want to trust you. You are no longer a safe person to her.

You obviously see where she\u2019s leaving it. You just gaze that direction periodically. \n\nOr you could actually let it get lost.
