You taught her that she can get her way by crying and having a fit and that you are a cruel lying manipulator.

You let her bring a favorite toy, and like any 6 year old she lost track of it. So you, a grown adult, decided to play a really cruel trick on a little kid. Then, when you saw how devastated she was, you kept it up. Then you blame her mother for the tantrums. That is not the way to go.\n\nSet limits from the beginning. If it is no toys, that is fine. Don't allow a tantrum to be an excuse not to parent. Don't blame her mother for you and her father's poor parenting at your house. I get that you (and hopefully her father) are really young. There are all kinds of good parenting books and websites that can help you without breaking the heart of a little kid.", "YTA - For giving in to her tantrum in the first place. Going to throw a hissy fit? Consequences, not capitulation.", "Going to the park should be a treat that she only gets to do if she\u2019s good. The moment she acted up and threw a tantrum about not being allowed to bring a toy, should be the moment she was given a time out and the trip to the park cancelled until her behaviour improved.\n\nYou may well have taught her a lesson, but it may not be the one you intended. What she learned today was \u201cif I continue to scream and throw a tantrum, I\u2019ll get what I want\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t trust my parents to not play cruel tricks on me\u201d \n\nYTA", "YTA but you would not be the asshole if you set a rule of not bringing certain toys and then stuck to that rule while she threw a fit. Keep throwing a fit and no park. What people here don't understand is that the distress of that is much greater than the distress caused by your attempt at teaching a lesson. While i don't agree with you holding on to the toy for more than a minute or so, i understand and know what it is like to have a child prone to throwing fits and why you would think this is a better solution than having skip the park and throwing a fit all day long. However, imo sticking to your original boundaries while more distressful will have a better long-term outcome even if it will take a long time for your child to realize fits won't get her what she wants and that period before she realizes will be hell.", "NTA. The lesson needed to be learned before that or any other toy or special item was lost. 10 minutes might have been a bit long for her age but no harm done in the end. \n\nYou tried to talk her out of taking the toy the relented with the condition that she be responsible and she wasn't.

No one else's opinion matters. \n\nHowever, I do think it is time that all three of you put your foot down and say no more toys to the park, period.", "YTA. This is how one of my parents parented me and my sibling, the end result wasn't pretty and neither of us ever forgot those sorts of \"lessons\". \n\nIf she forgets her toys, don't let her bring them. If she throws a tantrum, don't bring her to the park. If she doesn't learn her lesson, maybe seek professional help for advice on how to address this situation. If you don't find a way to stop this behavior young, it will only get worse. \n\nAlso, never create a situation where innocent bystanders have to pay for your parenting decision (i.e. little kids being harassed by your step daughter over your actions).", "YTA. Yeah, kids drop stuff, leave stuff. You're the adult parent who's meant to help her, pick stuff up, remember stuff. Hiding it is only going to cause her to not trust you. What was your game plan here?\n\nYou are heading for disaster, have you ever heard of the boy who cried wolf!? You know, the lesson we teach our kids. When she does actually lose something precious to her she's going to think you have it! I imagine if she kicks off about taking something to the park you're going to be in for one hell of a time.

POOR KID", "NTA\n\n\nSometimes you have to learn lessons.\n\n\nDon't let these people on here tell you different.  You didn't let her go a day, you didn't pretend to leave her at the house when she had her tantrum.\n\n\nYour in laws want you to enable her entitled behavior.  I have a 6 year old and she doesn't act like that when I say no to bringing things places, doesn't make herself sick.", "Let's see. You could have said to the six year old, \"Honey, you set your toy down. Do you want us to hold it and keep it safe while you play with other kids?\" Instead you caused your kid distress. YTA.

Your child would\u2019ve been inconsolable. Personally I feel like this is a good way to teach a child a lesson, in the end nobody was hurt and hopefully your step daughter has learned her lesson. The fact that her parents are in agreement with you should be enough to prove your nta.", "Hm... NAH.", "Yta. \n\nYou just stole from, lied to, and tricked a 6yo to feel horrible. Good for you. \n\nThat's not teaching her a lesson about losing things. That's just teaching her that it's OK to steal, lie, and trick people just because you think that you have a good reason.  \n\nTrust me. Once, she really loses a toy. She will learn very fast to keep them safe.", "YTA she will only learn that's it's ok to steal and lie.", "I wuld do the same", "YTA that was a dirty trick, and you are heartless.

Big difference.", "YTA. Letting her melt down thinking she lost her toy when you had it the whole time is, like, a weirdly vindictive thing to do to a six year old. She's six! If she's being careless with her things and she loses the toy, that's a direct consequence of her actions, and she has nobody to blame but herself. But now all she knows is that you lied to her and hid her favorite toy for... what? She's six. She's not going to understand the point you were trying to make. Especially since you gave in to what she wanted in the end. \n\nWhatever her overall problems may be, this isn't going to make her stop having tantrums. Especially not if she's still having those behaviors reinforced by other adults. Shit like this isn't going to do anything except make her upset and confused, because the adults in her life are all teaching her entirely different things and she doesn't know how to parse all of these conflicting ideas she's getting. Because she's six years old.", "YTA. You played a cruel \u201ctrick\u201d on a six year old to teach her a lesson.\n\nShe will not trust you now. Great job.", "NTA. Teaching kids stuff takes a lot of time and patience. It\u2019s going to get ugly. The best news is that you dad and mom are on the same page.", "She's 6 and I know you want her to 'learn a lesson', but a better way to have done it was to enforce the no-toys rule instead of causing her unnecessary distress over her favorite toy. \n\nYTA", "YTA; bro she's six. More likely she's gonna remember how you made her feel/cry rather than the \"lesson\".", "YTA\n\nThere are other ways to correct Rose's behavior, including calling her over, to speak to her privately, and telling her she needs to put away her toy while she goes off and does something else. Making her afraid she lost her toy was cruel. She is only 6-years-old. That might seem big to you right now, because your little one is a toddler, but it truly isn't all that big.\n\nYou're pretty young, yourself. Maybe you should just let her father handle this stuff. And tell him and Rose's mother, that you are going to let him handle this stuff. Then if Rose she ruins or loses a toy, that's their problem and responsibility.", "YTA. \n\nI know you want to teach her a lesson, but honestly at this age she\u2019s still to young to really grasp the message, she\u2019s only going to remember how you made her feel. How do you anticipate a six year old to watch over her toys?", "YTA. Either hold firm on not taking toys to public places, or let your kid bring them and keep an eye on the toy. I picked up my son's stuffed animal at least 3 times today at the grocery store when he dropped it out of the cart. They're little kids. Stop expecting them to act like adults.", "10 minutes? You sat and watched as she was distressed and lashing out for 10 minutes and think you did the right thing here? \n\nYTA. Learn to be an actual parent jfc. She's 6. This shit happens and little kids can be stubborn af. Guess what? You two are the adults here. \n\nShe won't go to the park without her toys? No park. \n\nThis situation should have been you or her father picking up her toy and telling her it was being out away for the rest of the trip. Tantrum? Ok time to go home. \n\nAnything is better that what you two did", "The issue causing her to have tantrums is that when she's at her mothers, she's rarely told no. She wasn't told no at our house until recently either. No wasn't in her vocabulary. Everything, down to food, what we watch, where we go to eat out, was all her choice to avoid tantrums, she was never made do what she didn't want to do. It wasn't until she started school and the teacher pointed out the issues that we copped on in our house, but no so much in the other house.", "It's funny because all evening, she's been putting her toys and books and whatever back exactly where they belong rather than leaving them where they don't belong", "This is not gaslighting, by definition it's something you do over a long period of time. This is called lying.", "This. OP could have said \u201csorry kid, you don\u2019t get to keep the toy with you.\u201d That would\u2019ve been an appropriate lesson.

Had it actually gone missing, there would be weeks of tears", "Normally, there's no toys at the park, and we rarely ever give into tantrums. \n\nI don't think it would've been kept so long if she wasn't being nasty to other kids or acting the way she was. There was a separate consequence for how she treated the other children since that's also an ongoing issue", "Our living situation at the moment (we're moving in 3 months), isn't exactly ideal for small children to run around and play. The inside of the house is small and could result in injury from playing in areas not designated for play, and the neighbourhood/street is covered in litter that could also result in injury. Taking them to the park tends to be the only outlet for their energy. Luckily, Rose has school during the week which helps with getting the energy out, but weekends really have no other option, so it's either the park or indoor play areas", "We did that. 4 separate times. She wanted to hold onto it, and also leave it down. She didn't want us having it, probably because we didn't want her bringing it in the first place", "Child is 6.

That\u2019s what they do. Why are you expecting her to behave like an adult", "I wouldn\u2019t tolerate any of that from a 2 year old. You can\u2019t address any of the issues without addressing the route which I am not going to guess at though I have some ideas.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you start with a child counsellor. They really work magic and will also enlighten you as to what you should and shouldn\u2019t be doing. \n\nChildren basically come out kind and good and it\u2019s our job to not ruin them. You need to back track to basic parenting, probably with help, before you try to teach any life lessons to the kid.", "Yea \u201cfunny\u201d she\u2019s learned you can\u2019t be trusted.

I\u2019m guessing by the way you keep making excuses in the comments, you don\u2019t care that everyone is telling you YTA. So, I\u2019m not even sure why you asked. She\u2019s only 6. I bet you won\u2019t do shit like this to your 18 mo. old when they\u2019re her age.", "Six year olds regularly forget things they\u2019re told. It doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s being a bad kid.

You caused her distress for *no reason*.", "But it hadn\u2019t gone missing. \n\nYou are punishing a child. \n\nDo you expect her to trust you and have a good relationship with you? You blew that it so.", "She thought one of the other kids took her toy because she never dreamed that her trusted step parent would do such a thing. You caused this mess and you let it drag on longer because you did not like her reaction. That is pathetic.", "She learned that nasty behavior somewhere. Her own stepmother is cruel to her.", "Then you tell her \u201cno\u201d and go put the toy in the car. You are the adult.", "Holding firm on what's being told no to is the solution. Trying to get her to understand why she's upset and to talk about her big feelings rather than screaming until shes sick, offering her a quiet space to calm down and regulate herself is what's normally done. At the start of our weeks, that doesn't work, and we're dealing with tantrums for the first two days non stop. By 3 three, she's a better behaved child. Day 4-7, no issues at all. We have her Friday to Friday every other week, and it's like this all the time. Every week. We've tried everything else.", "Hahahaha", "I expect her to behave like a 6 year old, but tantrums over not having microwave fries 4 days a week for dinner aren't on in our house, nor are tantrums over not being allowed in the babies crib/stroller/carseat, tantrums over not being allowed pull the cats tail, tantrums over not being allowed watch the TV for 7 hours straight or to be allowed play with an ipad all day on a school day. We don't put up with behaviour you'd expect from a 2 year old out of a 6 year old.", "Seriously, there is nothing funny about this.", "I'm trying to understand how you expect me to keep an eye on a teddy when I have two small children to be keeping an eye on.", "She doesn't listen. It's not forgetting, same thing has been said by school teachers and childcare workers. She simply doesn't care because she never has rules or discipline in moms house, yet she comes to our house and there's rules, structure and consequences for poor behaviour. \n\nShe does try to push our buttons, and breaks every rule imaginable because she lnows she can get away with it in her mom house and trys to here, so she can get what she wants.", "This sub loves to blow things out of proportion. They did not punish a child, they tried to teach a valuable lesson which is a parents job. The child wasn\u2019t in danger and they got their toy back in the end. \n\nWhat OP did is much better than the toy actually being lost or stolen.", "Exactly. This negative behavior is a direct result of OP\u2019s actions.", "Tricking her at the park was not okay. \n\nThis will make her not want to trust you. You are no longer a safe person to her.

You obviously see where she\u2019s leaving it. You just gaze that direction periodically. \n\nOr you could actually let it get lost.

The tantrums are a nightmare, but she's not a bad kid. Her issues are a result of shitty parenting in one house.", "They weren\u2019t deliberately cruel, they deliberately tried to teach a lesson.

He had his daughter at 15 when he didn't know what he was doing and clearly wasn't ready.\n\nSo, here is some advice to you from an older more experienced parent who also has worked with children for many years:\n\n1. You shouldn't have let her take the Teddy Bear to the park after saying no and then her having a tantrum. You and your husband are TRAINING her to tantrum. The most effective way to train an animal or child to keep up a behavior as long as possible even when they don't get what they want right is way is through what's called an intermittent reward schedule. Meaning that you sometimes reward them for tantruming and sometimes don't. If you give in every time she tantrums, she'll tantrum more but when you don't give in she may figure it's not working and give up. if you give in only sometimes when she tantrums, she'll learn to keep trying beacuse you never know when it will work.  \n2. You didn't teach her anything by stealing her bear other then you are liars and she can't trust you. I know you meant to teach her that another kid might take it or it might get lost *but those things didn't happen.* You and your husband stole it and lied. She didn't learn the things that didn't happen could happen, she learned you guys are lying thieves who will try to trick her into thinking things that didn't happen did. You are LESS credible now and he's LESS likely to believe you beacuse that's what lying does. \n3. You teach children honesty by example. Your teaching her to lie to you to get what she wants, like you do to her. Don't be surprised when she's as dishonest as you are. Or when she steals your stuff?\n4. Your bad behavior caused a meltdown in your step-daughter and her to harass other kids. You basically made the park experience miserable for not just your kid but other families with your lying and stealing. And then you let your step-daughter take out her frustration on others when your were the ones at fault? \n\nHere's what you do: You sit your step-daughter down as a couple *and you apologize.* You tell her adults can make mistakes too, and what you guys did was wrong, and you were sorry. Remember, kids learn by us behaving how we want them to behave, not just commanding them to be better people then us. If you want her to take responsibility and apologize when she messes up, when she lies to you, or when she steals from you, you better be doing the same.\n\nYou can explain you were worried another kid would take it and were hoping she'd see how that could happen if you did so. But that you shouldn't have lied and you shouldn't have hidden her toy, lying and stealing are wrong, and you realize you wouldn't want her to treat you that way. \n\nIf you want her to learn through \"natural consequences\" then they have to be actual natural consequences. That means you leave the bear where she left it and it MIGHT get taken or it might be fine. That's why natural consequences can't be counted on to teach your kids, beacuse we worry about risks that often don't occur. Now you can choose to inform her of the possible risk, do nothing, and see what happens. But at least where I live most likely nothing would happen to the bear if you hadn't been there. \n\nMy advice would be to sit down with her as a family and come up with a plan for next time, agreed upon in advance when she's not upset. If your fine with her taking toys to the park, great! But say that in advance don't change your mind due to a tantrum. And if they can't be her most favorite toy she'll be sad if lost, decide that in advance too and stick to it. Maybe make a list of toys she CAN take to the park together, have her help you write it, and then post it up near the door. Having her help you plan the list and write it down will give her buy in and make her more likely to agree when it's time to go. But if she dosen't, just calmly hold your rule. You can also talk to her and come up with a plan together (letting her take the lead on ideas) on how not to lose things at the park. Maybe you can bring a wagon and she can put stuff in it when she's not using it? Or she can leave it by you at the bench? Or at the end you just tell her to go find it? You could also have special (cheap) park toys you pick out together, chalk, or bubbles, or a cheap sand set, or frisbee, ball, etc?", "Jeez,  21 with 3 kids", ">We're doing everything we can to lessen the tantrums and to prevent them without giving in\n\nNo, you don't.

They also expect them to understand the consequences that might come with a temporary lack of attention while in public.  \n\nFor an adult, that seems like a pretty simple a + b = c scenario.   Leave your cherished possession at home because bad things could happen if you don't.  But kid brains don't work like that.   Kids of this age frequently have issues understanding permeance.   You see this when they face the loss of a family member or pet - they commonly won't understand that the person is 'gone forever' - even if it is explained to them repeatedly.  They will nod along, repeat key phrases (maybe 'nana is in heaven.  We won't see her again) and then at a later date will be completely shocked when they don't see nana.\n\nTo lie to and trick a child in this way doesn't teach them a lesson.

I was stopped at a red light, the kid behind me wasn't paying attention, and he hit me. (It's was a very slow crash, no damage, everyone was fine.) The poor kid was so shaken up. It took him several tries to put in the code for his lock screen, his hands were absolutely shaking when he gave me his license and insurance card. I actually just took a few minutes to reassure him that everything was fine and things like that happen, and then I asked if someone else could drive the rest of the way home, because he was absolutely going to feel that way- shaky and a little disoriented- for about 15-20 minutes. That's just what happens after a massive jolt of adrenaline or cortisol. I could tell him over and over and over that everything was fine and no one was hurt- but he had to wait out that physical response because logic doesn't override biology.\n\nSo putting the child into that state of panic (which it sounds like she already struggles with emotional regulation bc of the tantrum earlier) is just stupid AF if you're goal is to help the child learn a lesson. She didn't learn shit, expect that people will trick her and not offer aid even when they can."]}
