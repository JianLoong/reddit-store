Say it is more important for his health and for both of your happiness to focus on this now, and set a goal of walking with the prosthesis to start planning the next vacation.

I understand you being at your breaking point and needing an actual vacation where you're not a caretaker. But on the other hand your husband lost his leg. That's a huge deal and it's gonna take a while to get used to the prosthetic, no matter how hard he tries.\n\nHe may never feel comfortable walking fully again. He may prefer the wheelchair for long distances. That being said, he should be able to propel himself if that's his choice.\n\nYou shouldn't have to be his caretaker on vacation, but getting rid of the wheelchair shouldn't be the only way he takes care of himself. If he can move his own chair, you're still not pushing him either way.", "YTA.\n\nYou can rent electric wheelchairs. Companies the rent them out are all over the world and it\u2019s not even *crazy* expensive. Your husband lost his leg, he may never be able to push walk long distances again, even with a prosthetic and tons of PT. Banning him from family activities because of it is extremely cruel and isolating. You are N T A for not being able to push him, but there are other, better ways to handle it.\n\n(Signed, someone wheelchair bound who can\u2019t push themselves long distances and is still able to join my family on vacations.)", "You need to go on a vacation from being a caregiver. \nYou sound exhausted. He needs to be able to be independent.\nNTA", "YTA for the \"walking\" requirement.  \n\nN T A for asking him to think of solutions so that you won't have to push him the whole time.", "ESH This! He has a responsibility to both of you to complete PT and do his home exercises. Exercising in a pool is another good way to build up stamina and strength without putting pressure directly on his stump. \n\nBut, you need to keep in mind that it's harder for diabetics to become accustomed to prosthetics. Where someone else will blister and callous, a diabetic will blister and ulcerate. It's a far slower process, because how deep the infection can go. He may need to have multiple surgical procedures. \n\nMost diabetics with prosthetics travel with wheelchairs because forcing yourself to use a prosthetic once your stump becomes wounded is painful and dangerous. Perhaps look into renting an electric wheelchair where you go on vacation.", "Info: could you pick a more relaxing vacation that doesn't require so much walking?", "Yeah, he may be OK with not walking again, and instead using a wheelchair, and I don't think that's an unreasonable choice.  However, it sounds like he's capable of being more independent, and he SHOULD be focusing on improving that.", "NTA for the general concept, but I think the specific line you drew is wrong.  \"Not a wheelchair user\" is an unfair standard to hold him to.  \"Able to actually participate in our vacation without making me do extra work to take care of you\", however, would be fair.", "INFO: Given his limited mobility in the current wheelchair, why hasn't he changed to a motorized wheelchair?", "NTA, but my disabled wife goes on all of our vacations.  I make sure of it.", "ESH. You don't understand his struggle any more than he understands yours.

That might just be a day trip or a weekend. Let him know he needs to handle his own things, like his own luggage and be firm with the boundary.", "NTA. His situation is bad, but of his own making. And you\u2019re his wife, not his servant. There may always be things he needs help with, but if he doesn\u2019t start doing the things he can, and at this early stage also working to improve his mobility, he will create a life of misery for both of you.", "NTA- You've been telling him to take care of himself for over two decades and he didn't. He's 50 and lost a leg to diabetes, that's wild af. Your husband needs to make some serious changes, I don't think it's fair that he put you in this position. Furthermore, he's not doing the exercises, not getting counseling or going to PT. I think your request is very reasonable and it's really for his benefit.", "YTA\n\nMy dad lost his leg over two decades ago. He still gets sores that develop on his stump and inhibit his ability to walk. Your spouse may not be perfect, but he does deserve to have a spouse that supports him. It\u2019s hard enough to go through amputation, only to have your spouse say you cannot use a medical device that would help him.", "Please consider this, OP. Caregiver burnout is very real, and you've been in a hard place for a very long time. Vacations with your husband aren't fulfilling the purpose that a vacation should for you. You deserve a real break that allows you to relax and recharge. I know it likely feels impossible given the level of your husband's dependence, but it may also be very good for him to understand what his life would be like if you weren't there for support. Please try to make this happen.", "NAH. Yes it sounds like you have caregiver burnout.  However, it might not just be as simple as him doing more exercise. I knew a man now passed away who was in almost the identical situation. I think you might underestimate how much his heart issues might be preventing him from exercising. Even simple exercising - many people with heart conditions are afraid of this.  Even a good prosthetic leg can be painful to wear. My amputee friend certainly found his to be difficult to manage.\nWhy not skip the grand holidays and do something simple that doesn't require taking a whole bunch of luggage. Shorter holidays, holidays to resorts for older people. All sorts of options are out there. You could still go on vacation. I bet he feels badly. I bet he feels scared. I'm sorry you have this problem. But there are solutions rather than just saying no to any holiday.", "Does he do anything at all around the home or does he expect you to wait on him hand and foot.  If he thinks you need to be his never-ending servant, it might be time to take a break and move out.  See if a friend will rent you a room for a while, even if it is just a few days.  Give him a wakeup call.  I am the sole caregiver for my 90 plus mother.  It is so draining.  There is no way I could do a big trip.  I can barely handle the work being at home let alone being out on the road.", "First of all, NTA . You should sit down and explain to him the difficulty of having to take care of all the things that come with traveling and vacations and how it is exhausting and unfair for you to undertake, especially with him being disabled. It's not fair to you to have to make all the effort because he won't, even though going through those kinds of issues is not easy either, and it's understandable that he's struggling with it. But it's not an excuse for him not to take care of himself and put that burden on you. However, you could make it into an incentive for his progress, like rewards for milestones of improving. If he's given up, it means that he doesn't probably have much hope or motivation and something positive to look forward to and work toward may help encourage him. It's important that you have clear communication about this issue and how much it bothers and affects you though.\n\nI was recently really struggling with motivation for school as it has felt like its beating me down little by little over the years (6 full years of university going for engineering), so now it almost feels like my will is broken to even try anymore, even if it's for my benefit in the end, and I'm burnt out by it. Called my brother crying for the first time ever in my life and he suggested a trip for just the two of us to celebrate graduating and finally making it out of school. Was still crying, but more happy tears, and it gave more light to the darkened tunnel I've been stuck in for what has felt like forever.\n\nIt seems like he's taken his illness and shut himself in the dark, with no hope for that light at the end so no urgency to take care of himself. I'm sorry that this might sound like I'm the A-hole but asking for 20+ years is going to sound more like nagging whether that is the truth of the situation or not, and some positive encouragement, especially after losing a limb, may help encourage self-motivation to improve taking care of himself. I would suggest a serious talk with him and discussion about boundaries you may make about future vacations to make in order to take care of yourself. In the end, you're left with yourself, so especially if he won't do what he needs to, you should prioritize your needs and make sure you're not prioritizing someone over yourself who refuses to put the work in.\n\nWish you the best and I hope he can learn to see that there is something to work toward, whether it be a big or small goal. <3\n\nEDIT: Also would keep up the praise for making progress with the walker, good for him! :D", "NTA. His noncompliance relating to his health needs is why his is so severely disabled. He's responsible for his own hardships. He gets to pay the consequences.\n\nCaregivers tend to give too much of themselves to their wards, and it sounds like you have - in fact you've probably been enabling him to ignore his health all these years. It's not fair for you carry the additional burdens of his poor lifestyle choices, and it's acceptable to draw a line in the sand for your own health and welfare.\n\nGoing on vacation with someone who is disabled isn't just about pushing a wheelchair - it's also about having to get his crap for him and continue waiting on him hand and foot - like getting his clothes together and helping him dress, helping him bathe,  checking blood sugars, having to get his meals and manage his meds, managing wounds that will inevitably erupt from pressure and self-neglect, cleaning him up when he is incontinent, having to skip fun things to do because it's not possible to do in a wheelchair, ensuring destinations can accommodate his disability and on and on...\n\nGo, enjoy your vacation your way.", "YTA. You\u2019re married. You made promises to each other for the rest of your lives. What really tilts the scale to AH for me is that if genders were reversed it would be death by the Reddit mob for any man who was giving up on his wife due to poor health. Forget vacations. You need to find a way to get his spirits back and save his life by him wanting to thrive again. After all, thats what comes with marriage.", "Slight YTA because the walking requirement is not fully in his control. Prosthetic legs are tricky, the process can be long or not work well at all, and some people still need a wheelchair at least part time. And vacations can actually be quite physically demanding.\n\nBut N T A if you change the requirement to him being able to manage himself on the trip. Realistically it might be a combination of him building strength for longer self propelled wheel chair time, walking, plus him coordinating proper disability accommodations in the airport (they can absolutely handle stuff like bags, help you get around etc) or deciding to use a scooter for longer outings on vacation etc.", "NAH sounds like hubby may have a bit of depression. That can happen when you are dealing with multiple serious health issues. He needs to be assessed by a doctor asap. \n\n\nYou sound tired, which is understandable. It's a lot. Could you go away with a friend for a few days to recharge? \n\nThe stipulation of walking is a bit harsh. Learning to walk with a prosthetic can be very difficult. If it doesn't fit right, it can be very painful. He might also be a little fearful of falling.  This is common. It takes time to trust the artificial limb.", "NTA", "I honestly don\u2019t think anyone can give an honest ruling on this one without knowing more about your husband\u2019s perspective.\n\nOn one hand, my uncle went through a divorce because he was diabetic and refused to follow any of his doctor\u2019s recommendations, beyond what was necessary to live to the next day. His wife told him early on that while she\u2019d be there for him so long as he was doing what he could, she wasn\u2019t going to become his caretaker if he kept sabotaging his own future health. I don\u2019t think that was heartless or unfair of her.\n\nOn the other hand, my ex husband asked for a divorce the day after I got diagnosed with a couple chronic conditions. Maybe I\u2019m too close to the situation, but I always thought \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d included unexpected disabilities. And I know from personal experience how hard it is to even just process disabilities, not to mention battling to get to a level of function that will still be so far below what you once saw as the minimum. \n\nI guess what I\u2019m getting at is, is your husband giving up because it\u2019s easier to put the weight of his challenges on you? Or is he giving up because his mental health has taken such a toll and it feels hopeless? Did he not try harder earlier because he assumed you\u2019d be the one to face the consequences, or because he couldn\u2019t cope with the reality of his situation? If the former, I think it\u2019s time to stop begging him to try and start setting boundaries around what you\u2019ll do if he doesn\u2019t. But if the latter, maybe it would be better to help him get into therapy (ask his doctor for help finding sliding-scale options, there are resources out there for folks with financial constraints) and consider a vacation that doesn\u2019t put so much on you. It sounds like you\u2019re in desperate need of a break, but maybe you could do a relaxing week at home and go out for a spa day and a couple romantic dinners instead of going on a trip. That way, you avoid setting yourself up for more caregiver burnout, while also avoiding a situation where he feels like if he doesn\u2019t achieve specific milestones on a specific timeline, he\u2019ll lose you.", "Yta.", "Nta. I'm a type 1 diabetic. Self care is incredibly difficult. Sometimes I need incentive from my wife. And I know from experience that taking care of everything for him is going to make the situation stay exactly how it is now. \n\nMy a1c dropped from 11 to 6.9 with my wife  being here to keep me from falling into self pity.\n\nIncidentally, if yall have insurance, look into a cgm (constant glucose monitor) and insulin pump closed loop system. Dexcom can pair with Tandem insulin pumps and Omnipod 5 insulin pumps as an example. The pump adjusts basal rates (basal replaces the once a day long acting insulin injections) in real time based on blood sugar trends. I can't put into words how helpful this stuff is. I also can't exaggerate how much better he'll feel with a better a1c. It'll probably help him feel motivated to properly exercise himself to be able to walk again. \n\nI'm sorry for your situation, I genuinely hope it improves for both of you.", "i feel sorry for you ... yes this guy has health issues but instead of taking responsibility of his health he expected you to do everything for him you need to take a vacation with friends or family ... you need sometime when you are not taking care of him", "This is a very sad situation. Your husband most likely is depressed from this and the holiday might be something he was looking forward too or expecting. NTA though because it\u2019s also your holiday! You need a break. \n\nIs there any possibly of hiring a carer to join you or if you are staying at a hotel there is a chance they provide that service. I would look into that. \n\nIf that is not financially or otherwise possible you should go alone. While your away, take a breather and search for home help for when you return. If he isn\u2019t helping himself despite it becoming such a sad situation he may need help. Therapy. Motivation. Leave him alone for a few days to see how he copes. \n\nA very unfortunate situation all round. I wish you the best.", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand any of the other verdicts. Your husband\u2019s loss of limb and mobility is down to his own poor choices in regards to his health. My BIL is a type 1 diabetic and works very hard to maintain his sugar levels and has consequently never been at risk of losing a limb. You\u2019ve been forced to take on a care giver role and feel burnt out. If your husband doesn\u2019t want to help himself you cannot continue enabling his laziness.", "Yta and big times. Just hoping you get to miss a arm or leg. See how that is. my mother has got her leg amuptated 5 months ago. If you dont know what a drastic ajustment of live that is. I just hope that that poor guy finds a better fitted partner then a lousy one as you are.", "NTA AT ALL.", "NAH.\n\nI get your point of view, but also he's a 50 year old guy who has had his leg amputated and presumably went from walking to in a wheelchair. It's a big change to process and I'm not sure if punishment is the way forward here.", "NTA", "They are very expensive and cost as much as a new truck in some cases. It takes insurance forever to approve it if ever.

She needs rest. If her choice of words or plan makes no sense to you\n\nShe is at breaking point.", "Wow. Just wow. The man refuses to take care of himself, lost his leg because of that but because she\u2019s having caregiver burnout HE deserves better? SHE deserves better. Someone who\u2019s going to actively better her life! He lost his leg because he didn\u2019t want to do better for himself. He  didn\u2019t lose it in a war or to cancer, he lost it because as a grown man he still relies on his wife to prioritize HIS health for HIM."]}
