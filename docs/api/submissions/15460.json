I wouldn\u2019t make it about walking specifically but the vacation needs to be enjoyable for you.  He needs to be able to take care of himself, get where he needs to go and be a participant.  It sounds like that is not a possibility . \n\nI actually think you should go on vacation by yourself or with a friend. Care givers can get very burned out, and it\u2019s very hard when someone can\u2019t or won\u2019t help themselves for whatever reason.  I hope he can get the counseling someday but you cant force him and in the meantime you deserve to live life.", "This breaks my heart.  But your NTA.\nSometimes, tough love is necessary.", "NTA.  You can have all the compassion in the world for somebody, but if they keep sitting there refusing the ropes and life chairs that you send down into their pit...at a certain point you just gotta let them sit there with it until they figure out that it's not going to get better until they move.\n\nYou can't get better *for* somebody.  And you flat-out telling him that you will not pick up the slack for his refusal to get  himself into any type of therapy is not only good for you, it may (let's hope) be what finally kicks him into doing what he should.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to complete PT and the exercises given by his health professionals. Save the money and go on an even bigger holiday that you can both enjoy.", "NTA.\n\nHe must be in quite a bad mental state after an amputation, but he needs to work on it.", "NTA. While I sympathize his position is none to envy, it sounds like he has all the resources he needs but probably depressed or feels hopeless, understandable. Treat the next vacation as a carrot and not stick. Say it is more important for his health and for both of your happiness to focus on this now, and set a goal of walking with the prosthesis to start planning the next vacation. Being supportive of course is always important, but it is also important to keep yourself happy or you can't do it for either of you.", "NTA and good for you.

I understand you being at your breaking point and needing an actual vacation where you're not a caretaker. But on the other hand your husband lost his leg. That's a huge deal and it's gonna take a while to get used to the prosthetic, no matter how hard he tries.\n\nHe may never feel comfortable walking fully again. He may prefer the wheelchair for long distances. That being said, he should be able to propel himself if that's his choice.\n\nYou shouldn't have to be his caretaker on vacation, but getting rid of the wheelchair shouldn't be the only way he takes care of himself. If he can move his own chair, you're still not pushing him either way.", "YTA.\n\nYou can rent electric wheelchairs. Companies the rent them out are all over the world and it\u2019s not even *crazy* expensive. Your husband lost his leg, he may never be able to push walk long distances again, even with a prosthetic and tons of PT. Banning him from family activities because of it is extremely cruel and isolating. You are N T A for not being able to push him, but there are other, better ways to handle it.\n\n(Signed, someone wheelchair bound who can\u2019t push themselves long distances and is still able to join my family on vacations.)", "You need to go on a vacation from being a caregiver. \nYou sound exhausted. He needs to be able to be independent.\nNTA", "YTA for the \"walking\" requirement.  \n\nN T A for asking him to think of solutions so that you won't have to push him the whole time.", "ESH This! He has a responsibility to both of you to complete PT and do his home exercises. Exercising in a pool is another good way to build up stamina and strength without putting pressure directly on his stump. \n\nBut, you need to keep in mind that it's harder for diabetics to become accustomed to prosthetics. Where someone else will blister and callous, a diabetic will blister and ulcerate. It's a far slower process, because how deep the infection can go. He may need to have multiple surgical procedures. \n\nMost diabetics with prosthetics travel with wheelchairs because forcing yourself to use a prosthetic once your stump becomes wounded is painful and dangerous. Perhaps look into renting an electric wheelchair where you go on vacation.", "Info: could you pick a more relaxing vacation that doesn't require so much walking?", "Yeah, he may be OK with not walking again, and instead using a wheelchair, and I don't think that's an unreasonable choice.  However, it sounds like he's capable of being more independent, and he SHOULD be focusing on improving that.", "NTA for the general concept, but I think the specific line you drew is wrong.  \"Not a wheelchair user\" is an unfair standard to hold him to.  \"Able to actually participate in our vacation without making me do extra work to take care of you\", however, would be fair.", "INFO: Given his limited mobility in the current wheelchair, why hasn't he changed to a motorized wheelchair?", "NTA, but my disabled wife goes on all of our vacations.  I make sure of it.", "ESH. You don't understand his struggle any more than he understands yours. Assuming you outlive him, are you going to look back more fondly on a vacation in which you were kind of irritated at his mobility issues but got to experience some things together or whatever kind of pyrrhic victory you're trying to claim here?", "Yta", "NTA. \n\nMaybe ask him to plan a vacation that he can handle? That might just be a day trip or a weekend. Let him know he needs to handle his own things, like his own luggage and be firm with the boundary.", "NTA. His situation is bad, but of his own making. And you\u2019re his wife, not his servant. There may always be things he needs help with, but if he doesn\u2019t start doing the things he can, and at this early stage also working to improve his mobility, he will create a life of misery for both of you.", "NTA- You've been telling him to take care of himself for over two decades and he didn't. He's 50 and lost a leg to diabetes, that's wild af. Your husband needs to make some serious changes, I don't think it's fair that he put you in this position. Furthermore, he's not doing the exercises, not getting counseling or going to PT. I think your request is very reasonable and it's really for his benefit.", "YTA\n\nMy dad lost his leg over two decades ago. He still gets sores that develop on his stump and inhibit his ability to walk. Your spouse may not be perfect, but he does deserve to have a spouse that supports him. It\u2019s hard enough to go through amputation, only to have your spouse say you cannot use a medical device that would help him.", "Please consider this, OP. Caregiver burnout is very real, and you've been in a hard place for a very long time. Vacations with your husband aren't fulfilling the purpose that a vacation should for you. You deserve a real break that allows you to relax and recharge. I know it likely feels impossible given the level of your husband's dependence, but it may also be very good for him to understand what his life would be like if you weren't there for support. Please try to make this happen."]}
