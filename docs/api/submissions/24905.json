She used to have three but now she only has two. It has been devastating and had a huge impact on our community and friend group, as we all knew him well and were heartbroken to hear of his passing.\n\nI have been supporting her through the loss day in and day out, and she has been leaning on me throughout the whole ordeal. \n\nWell earlier today we were out grabbing lunch together. The server was very talkative and friendly with us and would ask us a bunch of questions about our lives and make some good conversation. She asked me how many kids I have and I said I have two. The server started asking questions about each of the kids, their ages, what they're doing right now, etc.\n\nI already kinda knew what was coming next, and she asked my friend the same question about how many kids she had. I was fully gonna let her answer but she seemed very shocked by the question and didn't say anything for like 30 seconds, and to help her and avoid having a situation where we needed to bring up the loss of her kid, I quickly jumped in and said \"oh she has two lovely kids and they're very close with mine, we've basically grown up together\". \n\nThe server then asked about their ages and what they do now and I just gave quick short answers about them both and then told her I was pretty hungry and asked what other appetizers she recommended, to switch the conversation topic.\n\nOnce the server left, I asked my friend if she was okay and I could tell she was very upset. She asked me why I did that and I apologized and said that it seemed like she was overwhelmed and I just wanted to switch the conversation topic but that I didn't mean any harm. She threw cash on the table and left me, and before leaving told me that I was an AH for disrespecting her late son like that.\n\nI texted her as soon as she left apologizing and telling her that I definitely meant no disrespect and that I love her and would never intentionally try to hurt her. I haven't heard from her all day, I even texted her husband telling him I was sorry but got a cold response in return.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1692319212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15u551t/aita_for_telling_people_my_friend_has_two_kids/", "score": 205, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I bet you said it in a panicked, quick thinking on your feet kind of way, and it wasn\u2019t meant to disregard her son but instead to not let the chatty server about all three kids. It can be hard to change the tone of a conversation when you\u2019ve been so predisposed to be nice in society and answer questions when asked. It\u2019s a good thing but can come back to bite you, as this situation clearly showed. Now in order to repair the damage of the situation, id suggest to do something special for them in memory of their son.   Maybe a locket with his picture in it, or if you have an old voice recording get a bear with his voice inside, something. Something that they could cherish forever.", "Listen.

She\u2019s the one who\u2019s dealing with this question, now and forever.", "YTA. Hard to imagine how writing off the existence of one of her kids could be interpreted as anything but an asshole move.

Your heart was in the right place. You clearly wanted to spare your friend from having that conversation with a complete stranger. But maybe she would have wanted to include her deceased child in the conversation, if she answered at all. Or perhaps you could have simply told the server that you're not sure your friend wants to talk about that, that you won't talk about why, and refuse to elaborate. That is if you think she would not have snapped out of her initial shock and answered for herself.", "What a terrible situation. I know you were just trying to help your friend, but next time leave it to her. Just be there if she needs your support afterward. \n\nNTA because your intentions were good, just misplaced.", "NAH I can really understand why you said two, knowing he was gonna ask questions. What if he asked about the third kid and you had to say he died? But I also get why she\u2019s upset. I think she is over reacting but it\u2019s okay, shes not doing well and it probably broke her to hear that.

If I were you, I also would have tried to save my friend from having to explain the recent death of her child to a random waitress. It\u2019s difficult to know what to do in that situation. \n\nI\u2019ve heard parents who have lost their children respond to that question in different ways, so I think it\u2019s reasonable that you wouldn\u2019t know what she prefers. She might not have even known until she heard you answer \u201ctwo kids.\u201d If the death was very recent, it\u2019s likely the first time she\u2019s been asked that question since his passing. Your answer was probably a reality-gut punch she wasn\u2019t ready to hear. \n\nI think your best course of action here is to give her a little space, then try to meet up with her to apologize and talk. I think if you come to the conversation ready to take on whatever she has to say with love and understanding, not trying to defend yourself, your friendship can survive this. \n\nGood luck, OP!", "NAH, you did what you thought was right in a situation with no right answer.\nThe only better option was to change the subject sooner so that she didn't get asked.\nShe's grieving, and she'll come around to realising that you meant well - just give her time.", "NTA.

Trying to go on living when you\u2019ve experienced a traumatic loss - to bury one of your own children - is something that you never truly recover from.  For her, mourning her son does not mean erasing him as if his life held no meaning. I know that\u2019s not what you were trying to do - but to her, that\u2019s how it was perceived. You knew her son, he had a name, an age, and he mattered.  I would write her a card or letter saying just that.  \u201cYour son X mattered to all of us. I know that our pain will never compare to yours and the tremendous loss that you feel each day.  But know that he mattered to so many people in our community - and to me.  At the restaurant, I awkwardly and badly handled an innocent question in an effort to try to save you the pain of answering.  However, my response was incredibly inappropriate and hurtful.  And I understand why you reacted that way.  Please know that I would never want to cause you any more pain - and I am so deeply sorry for what I said and for making you think X was forgotten.

She had 3 kids, in the past tense. She will always be a mother of 3 kids, but she currently has 2 kids. That's not disrespectful, that's just grammar.", "It means she doesn't have 3 kids anymore. She had 3 kids. Now she has 2.", "u/Affectionate-Roof-79...You gave a very good answer. The only thing I would add to what you said was to tell the server, after the initial few pleasantry questions, \"We're ready to put our order in. Can you stop asking about kids now.\"", "Her friend seemed stressed out and overwhelmed because she\u2026.lost a child. \nShe\u2019s not stressed out because she had three apples and now has two apples. Like we are taking about the death of a child. \n\nWow. Bro. Your comment is so cruel and heartless", "Any questions about my life feel personal. We are here for food, so our conversation should be about food. At a stretch, maybe we comment on the unusual weather. \n\nBut... we aren't here to talk about me. We are just  here to eat food. \n\n(Wait, wait. I just realised that, because I'm not from a country where people work for tips, there is probably a cultural difference.  I would find this line of questioning incredibly invasive and disruptive.\n, but might be a normal line fo questioning for op)", "Don\u2019t exist is not the same as never existing.", "Seems like a bit of a jump into rudeness, honestly. It's a fairly ordinary question, no need to escalate quite that quickly.", "Yeah, as someone who has had a child die and a dog die, it is very different. I love and miss both, but the two aren't comparable. Frankly, I've had to endure a lot of death both as a child and as an adult. Nothing comes close to your kid dying. \n\nYes, I use past tense to refer to my daughter. It has been 10 years since she died and it still feels wrong to exclude her. My answer to this question is solely based on if I am going to have long term interaction with someone. If I am, my answer is going to be I have 3 children. One is x age, one is x age, and my oldest is perpetually 11. \n\nIt isn't as awkward as just announcing your kid is dead. It is inclusive but also, most of the time, it doesn't lead to the look.", "So you think when someone asks how many children do you have, they\u2019re after the number of children that still have a pulse? On what planet is that the question someone would he asking a parent?", "She needs to chill out. NTA.", "Soft YTA. I get this was recent but I had 4 brothers. When strangers I will never see again asked how many siblings I have I include the dead one. Why? Because it doesn't matter to them. I'm more blunt now and say I had 4 but one died. Basically, there is no right or wrong way to answer the question and it is not your call to make.", "Yta. Shut your mouth and let people speak for themselves. You deserve this.", "It's tricky. I had a similar situation. My sister died, and I have two other half sisters, twins (same dad). \n\nAbout 18 months after my sister died I went to my uncle's as my dad and stepmom were visiting, and at the time I lived in the same city as my uncle. My uncle had some other guests, an old friend (and his partner) from where we're from, but who my dad hadn't seen since they were young. \n\nEither the friend or partner of the friend asked my dad how many kids he had, and my stepmum piped up, \"He's got 3 daughters.\" I was silently livid and said \"And [sister's name].\" Stepmum replied \"Oh yes, and [name], who we'll never forget.\" Which annoyed me even more because this is such a blah thing to say about a dead child; surely it goes without saying you'll \"never forget\" her? Just came across as Hallmark-y and yucky. But she often says things that don't sound right, without bad intentions, just because of the way she is (in some ways not the brightest, in others she is) so I didn't make an issue of it. \n\nAnyway then my aunt made a point of sending me home with tons of left over cake so I think she noticed \ud83d\ude02\n\nDespite absolutely understanding your friend's response, I do think possibly NAH (although am very close to saying Y T A). This was just a bit  maybe a bit thoughtless.", "If someone asks how many siblings I have, I say two, but one\u2019s passed away. Honest and to the point.", "\"Oh, my friend isn't the type to answer personal questions like that. She's not a chatterbox like me!(insert the best charming smile you have here) Now, is there something on the menu you'd particularly recommend?\"", "I\u2019m a grammar enthusiast myself, but I don\u2019t think correct grammar is the ultimate priority in this conversation. Sparing the grieving mother\u2019s feelings would be much more important in my opinion. Not to mention that this server is being pretty nosy! Maybe consider it a white lie instead of \u201clinguistically incorrect\u201d if that makes it more palatable.", "You don\u2019t pretend that they never existed though, that is basically what op did. The way they answered made it sound as if there was only ever two children. Wouldn\u2019t have been hard to mention how her third is no longer with us.", "Nah I kinda disagree. Currently, OP's friend has two kids. She used to have 3 but not anymore. Also maybe telling a server about your friend's recent dead child might not be super pog."]}
