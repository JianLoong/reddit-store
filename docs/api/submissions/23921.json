Based on your description, it sounds like your sister might have a hoarding disorder. Hoarders don't always hoard objects, they often hoard things that other people would consider trash. Cleaning up for your sister or having the kids clean up most likely won't help, because it could cause your sister to become depressed (which will worsen the state of the house), and push you away (which removes a support from both your sister and your neices and nephews). This is honestly way above Reddit's paygrade. The best first step would be to contact your sister. Don't shame her or yell at her, don't say the house is gross or dirty, but you need to get those kids out of that house. Is it possible for you to watch them at your house? This is just until your sister gets home. Let her know that you're concerned about her and her kids' health and would like to help (don't say this if you don't mean it). Try to find out why the house is in such a state; Is she too overwhelmed by the mess to clean it? Does she feel sentimental attachment to the items? This can help you figure out the best next step. If she is unwilling to try and clean up the house, you'll have to call CPS and probably an animal rescue to remove the kids and the dogs. Explain to her why you called and try to let her know that your concern comes from a place of love. She will probably be extremely angry at you, but at least the kids will be safe.

They do need to learn of course, but they\u2019ve been failed thus far.", "Either that or they\u2019re not cleaning? There\u2019s no reason that place should be that dirty if they\u2019re not picking up their trash or making their own bed. That\u2019s ridiculous", "OP never stated their age. For all we know, they\u2019re a child themselves. Perhaps they still live with their parents as well. Kids are supposed to be selfish.

My mom completely isolated herself for quite a while, she wouldn't let me bring friends to the house, and I was forbidden from ever telling anyone the state of our house.", "Kids learn what they live. If you don't teach a kid HOW to clean, they won't clean. Not the kids' fault, even if they are older.

And let's be honest, as much as the sister is ultimately at fault for letting the house get to this state, and there are not just cleaning/hygiene issues but full on repairs that need to be done which OP cannot address. But those kids have 100% contributed to the creation and endurance of the mess.", "This is the worst advice I have ever seen.", "The problem is those that need the most help deep cleaning are the least able to afford it.", "Hoarding is a psychological disorder much like OCD or ADHD. It's already so difficult for people to reach out due to the stigma that they're \"lazy and selfish\". It's not just them deciding not to clean, their brain often prevents them from cleaning and tells them they need more stuff to make themselves happy. They also tend to push away loved ones who would be able to help because they're ashamed of what they might think.", "If the mother has time to go camping for a weekend, she has time to clean.", "This is blaming the literal victims. Their mom is in charge of the house and you are blaming the kids saying the mom is overwhelmed (which you\u2019re assuming).", "Not her duty to deal with it. But it is a choice for her to help the kids out if she wants to.", "Why YTA?", "Please ignore this. Do not call CPS on your sister and her 4 children. Talk to her about the mess and what to do to make it better.", "OP has two choices. read her sister the riot act, help her get her home habitable and give a serious warning about future consequences or call CPS. The kids need a serious talk too. I would be gentler with them, but they are old enough to take some responsibility for the house's cleanliness (not the repairs).", "The 16 and 12 year olds should be helping keep the house straight. Why not organize the kids and do a big clean up? If the kids don\u2019t already know how to pick up, sweep and mop it\u2019s time they learned. It is ridiculous how many older kids don\u2019t have life skills.

They do pick people like these who make them and their channel look good, and of course people also like helping.\n\nOr contact local public and third sector services for help. It may end up being down to OP, friends and family but there is no reason they shouldn't look out for help too.", "Depends on what she means by put together.

Missed that. \nI thought they just couldn\u2019t get to their beds with all the crap piled on top. \n\nSo it\u2019s not just a messy house, it\u2019s legit neglect. \n\nSister needs to get some professional help. I can understand getting overwhelmed at times, but it seems like everyone in that house has just given up.", "I won't give a judgement, but I think you need to talk to her and find out what's going on.

This past spring, I watched the state oversee cleaning and repairs free of charge for one situation.", "There is only so far CPS would allow a house that has kids to be. Most situations yeah, they give the parent/s an order to clean the house to such and such standards before X date but some cases, the house is such a safety hazard the kids can not be allowed to stay. From what OP describes I wonder what certain things are like, let's say with the trash, is there rotting food just sitting out in the kitchen? Is there 2 month old food in the kids bedrooms? How about the bathroom, how long has the water been leaking, has it been long enough for mold and/or fungi to grow? These we don't know, but if CPS were to investigate there is a very probable chance the kids would be taken out because of the health risk if these were fact.", "This is not \"the kids aren't making their beds\" - this is WAY beyond something that a child has responsibility for.", "The beds, it sounds like, aren't assembled. There is trash everywhere. This isn't on the kids. This is Mom.", "What? You\u2019ve never heard of parents taking getaway trips when they are overwhelmed????", "Mental illness? Never seen hoarders? Been a single parent with mental Illness? People need help. She sounds like she doesn\u2019t have a support system by way of family friends or treatment team.", "By all means, offer your own.", "Actually this is wonderful advice and what should happen.", "Right. Because mental illness or being the sole caretaker of four human beings doesn't weigh on anyone's chest or life or mental. Clearly auntie op has an opportunity to teach her nibs some very crucial life skills that every human being needs to learn, i.e clean up or even self responsibility. I did my own laundry at 12 because I had to! Does mom sound irresponsible? Yes. Given sister offered to babysit or she probably wouldn't be at said camping trip getting a break, which other humans with or without kids deserve as well. It takes a village!!! And from the sounds of it her sister OP isn't really an active part of the village to just find out how her family is living. HER FAMILY, HER NIECES AND NEPHEWS THAT SHE WOULD RATHER DITCH THAN TEACH HOW TO CLEAN UP TO SAVE THEMSELVES LATER IN LIFE. But by all means let's look at the mom and ignore the fact that OP has an opportunity to teach her family and also be petty and write a big ass CHORE CHART in the front of the house to bring attention to whats needed!! Mom included!!!! So many other options than ditching the kids and shaming your sister", "Yikes if I ever heard an over reach statement. 16 is the age of consent in most states to be married so I'm pretty sure it's ok to ask them to complete chores. Or possibly teach them chores if mom didn't. Oops now I blamed mom?! A trashed house with literal teen and tween screams overwhelmed single PARENT (let's blame both this time) or untreated mental illness. Most humans do not just decide to live in filth. Pretty sure sister has been struggling awhile to accumulate a house full of mess. Where did it say I BLAMED THE CHILDREN?? That's you assuming. All I stated was the ages of competence. Have a good day *edit op literally said sister needed a break aka overwhelmed. Imma say victim blaming is a definition other than what you applied\u270c\ufe0f", "Agreed.", "Because she agreed to take care of her nieces and nephews and is now considering abandoning them and leaving them alone in awful conditions.", "Call CPS. This is a form of neglect, and it can have serious consequences on both the mental and physical health of the children. CPS will almost certainly NOT remove the children. They WILL make mom clean up and have a follow up inspection.\n\nI'd also suggest calling animal welfare services if OP thinks the dogs are being neglected.", "Neglect. It\u2019s called neglect. The solution is to document and call CPS, not to draft the kids into covering it up.", "There are 3 kids who can report - 16 yo & 12 yo - in this house. Maybe ask them how the house got in this state. Sorry I am not certain I fully trust the opinion of someone who believes they can just leave 4 kids. OP is not concerned about the kids just themself. There are a million question that need to be asked before anyone should be reporting anything.\n\neta \u2014 recommending OP call CPS based on this post is ridiculous & reckless. Have you ever lived with 4 kids?", "Especially the 8 year old.", "True, sleeping on the couch seems a bit extreme if it just needs bedding but I guess if they don't know how to do it or something that may be the case.", "Sounds like some just have trash on their beds, some they haven't been put together. Yeah I definitely agree, a support worker or similar seems to be needed here.", "Where?", "Exactly. There\u2019s two 12yo, a 16, yo and an 8yo that can\u2019t pick up trash? They\u2019re kids all they do is create trash. It makes no sense they\u2019re sleeping on a couch when they should be cleaning off their beds. Bed not assembled is on mom but that\u2019s no reason to call CPS. The real problem is the kids are to comfortable living in filth. There\u2019s no way they should be allowed to do that", "Not when their kids are living in squalor", "And leaving four kids behind in a dilapidated home? No, I've honestly not.", "Oh please, hers is laziness, not mental illness.  If she is fine enough to go on a trip, she is fine enough to clean up her house. Nobody likes cleaning the house, but we've got to do it nevertheless.", ">LLEAVE nd tell her to clean the house or you are calling CPS.\n\nPlease do not leave the children in the house.  If you said you'd be responsible for them, please don't leave them.  I know the oldest is 16, but hand off the kids to another responsible adult or wait for the mother to return.\n\nCalling CPS is reasonable.  If you had a hard time falling asleep due to the smell and the mess is so extreme that it endangers the childrens' well being, call CPS.", "I thought she said she would find another babysitter? If she is just going to leave them alone then totally TAH but if they are being cared for by someone then that\u2019s fine.", "This is ridiculous and reactionary. The mother may have mental health struggles. Organize the kids to help clean up and sit the mom down and give her a warning. She is a single mother and may need help. You lack compassion and a basic understanding of CPS's function. Grow up.", "Neglect is a symptom of another health problem.", "Especially when 3 of those kids are 12 or older. This is a single parent. Those kids are old enough to clean up after themselves. I get so tired of people on this site who don't know better dictating to others to call CPS, as if CPS is just sitting around waiting for their calls.", "Uh yes, I have four and my house is never disgusting and reeking and covered in trash,. My kids can sleep in their clean beds and all that. The mom here is seriously neglectful if this is a *normal* condition of the house and she even thought it was just *messy* ATM.

That can only happen from an adult willfully ignoring a pretty obvious plumbing problem.", "I agree with you there. I really think the mom has some sort of mental Illness. How could she not with those living conditions.", "Ok. You\u2019re right.", "She said she was going to tell her sister to get a new babysitter and leave. To me, that sounds like abandoning the children without a solution.

(Now 26,26,28,30 all moved out) They had their own living room, game room, bathrooms & bedrooms. I did not care how it looked up there. Our guests never went up there & cleaning up after capable people was not my priority in life. They we\u2019re not abused or neglected they were responsible for their own space. They cleaned it when they cleaned it. \n\nI can think of 3 repairs that need to get done in our home right now. Our 3 dogs do not help our house to smell like fresh daisies. Our house is currently covered in dog fur... because 3 labs shed. My husband left all his ripped open mail & packaging trash on the kitchen table today with his dirty breakfast dishes. He is an adult he will eventually clean it up. If we walked out of the house for vacation right now my house would look like we lived here. I\u2019m not the maid in my home.", "Oh absolutely! This isn't a problem that can just be brushed under the rug", "The house can be cleaned by the children, they are choosing not to by the looks of it. The plumbing has probably been brought up, if it\u2019s kit fixed then then it\u2019ll probably get fixed another day. What can be fixed is their garbage can of a house", "She could, that is a possibility. We don\u2019t know enough to judge. Or she could just be lazy. It definitely warrants a conversation with her sister even though it will be uncomfortable", "Ahh fair fair. Depends on the intentions. I don\u2019t blame her for leaving if the kids are cared for and the situation is reported. But you can\u2019t just leave the kids!"]}
