I was the one who found out after I came home from seeing a friend and found them clearly right after doing what they were doing. She told me not to tell dad, and she waited three weeks to do it while I couldn't tell anybody. After that she and the woman (we all already knew my mom was bi) stayed together and still are.\n\nOffically they got 50/50 custody, but they agreed to stay in the same city and just let my sister (15F) and I choose where to live. I chose to stay with my dad full time, and have only spoken to my mother maybe six times since she moved out, I blocked her number too. My sister wasn't told why they broke up, and for some reason assumed our dad was being awful to her, even after our mom said otherwise. She only really came to see us a few times a month, and always seemed like she blamed dad for the divorce. I eventually explained why it happened after a year, but she said people do it for a lot of reasons, and even accused me of being homophobic for not wanting to meet my moms girlfriend.\n\nOur relationship really took a turn after that. I refused to let my mom come to holidays or birthdays or anything, and so my sister boycotted those as well. She did the same at my graduation last year when I didn't invite mom, and since then I mostly gave up. I don't really reach out much anymore, because there isn't really a point. She'll keep defending mom and her girlfriend (who my sister now calls her stepmom) and will side with her over dad and I. Lately she's been texting me asking why I never want to hang out anymore, and really I just decided to let her know. I told her I don't really think we're compatible to have a strong relationship anymore, since we'll never agree about how things went down between our parents. I obviously still love her and that won't change, but if she still thinks I'm mistreating our mother, than I don't think we should spend much time together anymore.\n\nI still feel really guilty about that, since she even called dad to ask why I \"don't love her\" anymore. He thinks we could at least meet up somewhere mom won't be, but I really don't want that anymore. The truth is I've lost a lot of respect for her over how she acted, and just don't see much of a point anymore.", "created_utc": 1680666249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c7a7l/aita_for_not_going_out_of_my_way_to_spend_time/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's traumatic and abusive behavior coming from a parent. Your sister should understand that you don't want to associate with someone who would treat you that way, and if she can't, then it is probably better for you to keep some emotional distance from her.", "You were her age when you discovered the infidelity. Which is a lot. She was 12 and didn't have to process it all at once like you did.

It's understandable that you feel guilty about your relationship with your sister, but it's important to prioritize your own mental health and well-being.\r  \n\r  \nIt's okay to have different opinions and feelings about your parents' divorce and your mother's behavior, and it's okay to set boundaries in your relationships with family members. It's important to communicate your boundaries clearly and respectfully, and it sounds like you have done that with your sister.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, if you do decide to meet up with your sister in the future, you might consider setting some ground rules for the conversation beforehand, such as not discussing your mother or her girlfriend, and focusing on positive topics or shared interests.\r  \n\r  \nRemember that you are not responsible for your sister's feelings or reactions, and it's okay to take care of yourself first. You might also consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor to help you process your feelings and cope with the challenges of your family situation.", "Apparently she thinks she and your mom are a package deal.

(Except your mom) However, what\u2019s really important for you to understand is that your sister is 15. Maybe you\u2019re also too young to fully see this, but she is a child. The idea that she will never see reason is wrong. None of this is her fault. Do what you have to do, but keep in mind your sister is going to grow up and will probably get some perspective, and it will be a shame if permanent damage is done to your relationship because of your mother\u2019s actions when you were both kids. Yeah, 18 is a kid too.

No parent should make a child choose a side, but it\u2019s wrong to expect your sister to play along with picking sides. That\u2019s not healthy! You siblings should not be fighting because of them.", "NTA!\n\nJust know that what happened between your parents have nothing to do with you or your sister. \n\nI am sure both your parents love you both. \nI wish you and your sister don\u2019t take sides as you are born from both of them and they didn\u2019t separate because of you two. They were just not good for each other. \n\nYour sister is also younger and has her own thoughts, she can\u2019t see things the same way as you or anyone.  We see the world from our own perspectives. No two people will ever agree/see things the same way. \n\nJust give her a chance, you won\u2019t regret it.", "NAH, You didn't cause this mess, but it's not fair to expect your sister to stop caring about her mom. Yes, your mom betrayed your father, and I'm sure you feel betrayed too. Things aren't always black and white though and relationships are hard. People cheat for a reason and its not 100% on just one person in the marriage. You dont have to agree with your sister about everything to have a relationship with her. You'll never get this time back and if you can put your hurt feelings regarding your parents aside and take that out of the equation when it comes to your own relationship with your sister I think that would help. Clearly the woman your mother is dating makes her happy and everyone deserves that.", "NTA, but I would recommend trying to maintain a relationship and not judge her too harshly for decisions she made (however misguided) as a child/teen.\n\nMost kids don't grasp the depth of the betrayal until they have some personal experience with romantic relationships.\n\nShe is just getting to that point in her life, so you might be able to have a better conversation about it.  you rightly feel very strongly about it as you caught them, the cheating is not a concept to you, it was shown in living cover.  Your mum asking you to wait before telling your Dad was extra shitty.\n\nHave you had any contact with your mum since, because even if you don't want to meet her affair partner (should be your choice) if she was a good parent, some contact might be beneficial especially if you have some anger you want to direct her way.\n\nall the best.", "You expect her to feel like you feel towards your mom. She is an individual with a brain like you. Now each sibling views their parents differently. NAH", "ESH. It's understandable that you don't want to concede in any point referring to your mom's affair, but your sister's a teenager trying to find balance and stability in a shitty situation. She's not your responsibility, and it's good that you're not taking that responsibility, but she probably does look up to you, at least for guidance.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry you caught your mom cheating. But get over it. You\u2019re wasting time being bitter about something that has nothing to do with you. Your mom is your family, but her marriage was hers and your fathers. You shouldn\u2019t be in their marriage business. At the end of the day.

Your mother for involving you in her adult relationship and you for staying in it.", "NTA your mother decided to throw her relationship away and your sister decided to stay ignorant and call you a homophobe instead of thinking about the situation even a little bit.

Well damn I guess it's dads fault what a scumbag!- \n\nJust go full NC you're dealing with a cheater and an enabler who's willing to throw your feelings under the bus to protect the cheater, neither of them are worth yours or anyone's time.", "Where did you get \u201ccoerced\u201d from?", "Thanks, I have been seeing someone for a year, so that's helped.", "Then OP cannot talk about dad either.", "Both I guess.", "So do the absolute opposite of what op is doing then", "Meh\u2026 if you have to witness it, keep it a secret and watch the loss of your family unit - kinda does it your business\u2026", "Her mom is the AH for making her daughter keep a secret that she shouldn't have had to keep. She made her daughter live with the secret of her (the mom) choices. It's going to build up resentment in someone who doesn't want to be a part of a secret that they never wanted to be a part of. Her mom put her in that situation.", "It destroyed her family, separated them all, and she was forced to actively keep the cheating a secret. It absolutely is her business.

As is her respecting them.", "Well she doesn\u2019t have to go out of her way.

And your parents sex lives\u2026 not your business.", "She lived with the secret for three weeks. Calm down. The point of getting over things is to get over your ressentiments. It sucks she was exposed to that. But parents are people too. And people suck sometimes. Your parents not being compatible is not grounds for cutting them off.
