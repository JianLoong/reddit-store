We used to go on dates and make out and stuff.  We never liked each other enough at the same time to do anything. I think we're like Harry and Sally if they had ended up friends.  \n\nHe has always been the type of person who needs to be wanted.  He would get annoyed bc I never got jealous. I remember some girl flirting with him in a cab once.  He got annoyed that i didn't have a reaction.  \n\nHe would always nitpick at me and say I was not hot enough, my friends were not associated with the higher end people in our school (we went to school with people who are now famous or relatives of famous people), etc. He just always wanted whatever he didn't have.  \n\nHe is married but when we talk to catch up he mentions he finds his Co workers attractive.  He called me when he thought he would be in town and randomly started trying to flirt with me. I just changed the subject.  But it left me feeling irritated.  \n \nAnyway\n\nToday he told me he is getting separated from his wife. I told him it wasn't surprising given the way he acts, his desires and insecurities. I urge him to find out who he really is and what he wants.  I told him he doesn't love himself and so can not accept love from others.  \n\nHe got really offended and said it seemed like I didn't care.  I told him he was the one who initiated the separation and the only reason he gave,  though it may not be the only reason was sex.  He told me he didn't want to regret his life.  \n\nBut that's a constant theme in his life.. it's like fomo. \n\nI kind of saw this coming from a million miles away and tbh I have no sympathy.  To me it's just dramatic people being dramatic.  I hate to say it.  He made his bed and lied in it. Like,  dude,  you talk about wanting to have rough sex with your Co worker one minute and* the next you're like,  I'm going to spend time with my wife.

If I kept a friend like that I would have to be wary of some weird unknown rare eye-disease that occurs when you roll them too much.", "NTA. Sometimes the kindest thing to do is tell someone the truth. He needed that reality check.", "OP: gives heartfelt and very helpful advice on the nature of the soul and love. Expresses genuine concern and a hope for her friend to find peace and a better future for himself.\n\nOP\u2019s friend: \u201cit\u2019s like you don\u2019t even care\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA. He needed a reality check. He probably won't do any work on himself, but people who are that insecure and needy and never happy. Because they aren't happy with themselves.", "YTA. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if everything else you said is true. It\u2019s all you could think in the moment, was about you being right, yes-YTA. He\u2019s right. You don\u2019t care, and you admitted to that in your own writing. Move on, you\u2019re not this guy\u2019s friend.", "tbh it kinda sounds like you have feelings for him but you\u2019re trying to convince yourself it\u2019s the other way around", "If she was physically cold and intimately distant, it\u2019s a valid reason to get separated. That\u2019s untenable for a lot of people, and it\u2019s got nothing to do with insecurity or not loving oneself or anything like that. So kind of an asshole-ish thing to say.", "Was it wrong to say this in a general sense? No. To highlight something you\u2019ve noticed as a trend in his life could be helpful for him to reflect on.\n\nWas it wrong to bring it up in the conversation where he said he\u2019s separating? Yes, absolutely. It reads as if he said \u201cI\u2019m getting separated\u201d and you said \u201cI\u2019m more interested in being right in this conversation than kind\u201d. Whether you believe it or not, he likely had real love and connection with his ex-wife and you absolutely could have been more gentle with this conversation.\n\nBut as you said, you have no sympathy for him so probably stop being his friend. \n\nYTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
