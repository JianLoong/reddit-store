My friend who\u2019s not a gym goer agrees.", "NTA - Your whole interaction with her seemed reasonable.  Even your last comment wasn't an AH move.  She seems more like the AH here but like you said she might be going through some ish.", "How do you not know how many sets you have left?? LOL NTA. Perfectly normal gym etiquette to ask, and if she\u2019d answered normally by advising how many sets she has and that she\u2019d rather not work you in b/c she just wants to get them done, you now have the info you need and could decide what you want to do. I know most people either prefer machines or free weights, but if you figured she\u2019s gonna be another 15 min and you want to go, you could possibly decide to just use dumbbells and go home. But if she\u2019s only got one set left, you could decide to just wait and use the machine when she\u2019s done. That fucking simple. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to work you in, it\u2019s that she was being so goddam vague about it, leaving you with no recourse to make a choice.", "NTA.\n\nGym etiquette is if someone asks how many sets it means they are waiting.

She should have let you work in or moved on herself, especially if that's the only machine in the gym for that exercise. 10 mins is more than adequate to do 4 sets and have over a minute rest inbetween.

But escalating it at the end like that is never going to get the other person to get that they're being rude. \n\nIt should be well known gym etiquette that you don't just sit on a machine indefinitely without being willing to let others work in.  I'm a woman and I've definitely had people react badly to a polite \"may I work in, in between your sets?\"  Some people are just jerks and cluing them in to their jerkness never works.\n\nHowever, if you're a guy, it's entirely possible that she was so sure you were hitting on her that she wasn't really fully processing it.

So for her to hog it, and not give any type of eta is just eww.\n\nMessed up part is there were probably other people who were also waiting on that same machine, but probably thought they'd wait while doing something else. \n\n\nIm a gorgeous (the words of countless strangers) woman who goes to the gym myself, I would never act like this.

I'm not saying you're the A H because you did nothing wrong (apart from that last comment I think) but it is possible she was having a hard time just getting to the machine. At least in my gym it's like this : the machines are always being used by a bunch of big dudes and I never dare to go there, because they watch, sometimes they try to hit on you, and they are using heavy weights, and I'm not sure how to use the machine, so it makes me nervous. Each time I use a machine (rare occurrences) I feel on edge and really not comfortable. Maybe (big maybe) that could be what happened to her.\n\nMaybe that was also what triggered the \"I don't know how many sets\" problem. If she's kind of new and you obviously know what your doing, maybe she doesn't have a number of rep or sets, she's just working out until she feels sore, and you asking that question (with no bad intentions) made her feel judged or something. \n\nI see that you were just waiting for your work out and I do not doubt that, but just keep in mind that being a woman in a gym can be uncomfortable.", "She most likely didn't know that, though. While her attitude wasn't needed, it's common for many of us to assume that if a guy walks up to us for seemingly no reason, it's most likely they will try to hit on us or be creepy/dangerous. It's a safety thing - better to be safe than sorry, ya know?\n\n10 minutes really isn't a lot of time for some people, especially if the person gets distracted easily or has no concept of time. Maybe she was trying to learn to use the machine efficiently? That usually takes time. (Of course, though, she should be doing that when she ISN'T on the machine, but still.) Again, the attitude she had wasn't necessary, but it is understandable.\n\nYou're NTA, overall. Her attitude wasn't needed.\n\nEdit:: sorry for repeating basically the same line 3 times. \ud83d\ude05 Just noticed it.

I was close enough to her machine for anyone else coming up to see that I was waiting for it but it wasn't like I was hovering over her or staring at her. Like I said in the post, I was mostly looking at my phone and only occasionally glancing over. I think I have enough tact to not actively be staring at someone. Tbh, I see people waiting for machines like this all the time where they stand in close enough proximity to not interfere/interrupt the person but also let anyone else coming up know that they're next. What I'm doing isn't out of the ordinary.", "I get that, but we live in a society. If someone does not want anyone near them, then they must stay home. Especially if they hog community services. Do you keep the elevator door open for minutes, when someone is rude?", "Correct", "You're effective, that's why. On machines I'm struggling with it can be longer. 4 sets, 3 breaks. Breaks alone are 6 minutes already because I can't fix my breath in just one minute. And sets take definitely longer than a minute each. So would be around 15-20 depending on how fast I'm able to move.\n\nGirl in question is in wrong, she should have shared."]}
