I only had one more main workout on the Lateral Raise Machine. I walked over and saw that a girl was already on it. No big deal, I thought, I'll just wait behind her and relax. I don't mind taking a break to scroll through Reddit anyways because I'm almost done anyways.  \nAs I'm scrolling through Reddit for about 10 minutes, I can't help but notice that the girl using the machine is kind of fiddling with the machine, doing maybe 3-5 reps and then sitting there on her phone or just listening to music. Tbh, I know it's not my business whether or not she's actually being productive with her workout or not but at the same time, 10 minutes has gone by and I want to finish up already. So I walk over to her, and politely say to her \"Excuse me, sorry to bug, but do you have a lot more on this machine?\" (something I've asked to a lot of people in my gym career) I can tell right from the beginning that she seems standoffish because she doesn't even take the time to take out her airpods before giving me a look as if to say go away. I have to repeat what I say again before she is willing to take her airpods out to actually hear me/address me.  \nAfter asking her again how many more sets she has, she responds that she \"doesn't know how many more she has and that she's just trying to workout\". I then ask her if it's cool that I work in, in which she gives me a dirty look and says \"No, I just want to be able to workout.\" I respond, \"Okay but...indefinitely?\" and she says \"I'm just trying to workout\" It seemed like she was getting defensive over me asking her at all and I told her that I'm not being rude by asking, this is pretty normal thing to do. She responds with something to the effect of \"I know that it's normal but I just don't want to share. I want to use it until I'm done.\"  \nI was honestly fucking frustrated at this point because she had already been on the machine for a long time and when I politely asked her, she's telling me she doesn't know how many more she has and simultaneously is telling me she doesn't want to share either. So, how long am I going to wait then? She was also pretty rude and petty during this entire exchange while I was trying to be polite and respectful. I also thought that maybe she's new but it seems like she wasn't if she knows that people asking to join her is the norm but she chooses not to do it.  \nI ended up ending the conversation by saying \"Well, I don't know what's going on in your life to be acting like this but I genuinely hope it gets better because you're acting rude.\"  \nI know people aren't obligated to share if someone asks but if you're going to just fuck around with the machine for as long as you want, with no timeline on when you'll be done, isn't that kind of a dick move?  \nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686275584, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144rzb6/aita_for_getting_annoyed_a_girl_wouldnt_share_her/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, what is not reasonable is her stank attitude. A simple \u201cno I\u2019m sorry\u201d would suffice. My friend who\u2019s not a gym goer agrees.", "NTA - Your whole interaction with her seemed reasonable.  Even your last comment wasn't an AH move.  She seems more like the AH here but like you said she might be going through some ish.", "How do you not know how many sets you have left?? LOL NTA. Perfectly normal gym etiquette to ask, and if she\u2019d answered normally by advising how many sets she has and that she\u2019d rather not work you in b/c she just wants to get them done, you now have the info you need and could decide what you want to do. I know most people either prefer machines or free weights, but if you figured she\u2019s gonna be another 15 min and you want to go, you could possibly decide to just use dumbbells and go home. But if she\u2019s only got one set left, you could decide to just wait and use the machine when she\u2019s done. That fucking simple. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to work you in, it\u2019s that she was being so goddam vague about it, leaving you with no recourse to make a choice.", "NTA.\n\nGym etiquette is if someone asks how many sets it means they are waiting. They are happy to wait but are counting your sets so don't be a dick: finish your sets and vacate. \n\nShe's probably new and has no idea what she's doing.", "NTA, that's normal gym etiquette. She should have let you work in or moved on herself, especially if that's the only machine in the gym for that exercise. 10 mins is more than adequate to do 4 sets and have over a minute rest inbetween. You can't just sit there and hoard the equipment, the gym is a shared space", "NTA.  But escalating it at the end like that is never going to get the other person to get that they're being rude. \n\nIt should be well known gym etiquette that you don't just sit on a machine indefinitely without being willing to let others work in.  I'm a woman and I've definitely had people react badly to a polite \"may I work in, in between your sets?\"  Some people are just jerks and cluing them in to their jerkness never works.\n\nHowever, if you're a guy, it's entirely possible that she was so sure you were hitting on her that she wasn't really fully processing it.   That may be where her rudeness was coming from.", "INFO: Gender? If you're a guy, she may have been under the impression that you were trying to hit on her. Doesn't excuse the attitude, but might explain it.", "It's not your fault because you talked to her properly but she didn't lend you the machine, you should have told this to the trainer to be reprimanded.", "Nta, she was being rude for no reason.  \n\nPeople who actually go to the gym to workout knows that any gym will more than likely only have 1-2 of each machine.  So for her to hog it, and not give any type of eta is just eww.\n\nMessed up part is there were probably other people who were also waiting on that same machine, but probably thought they'd wait while doing something else. \n\n\nIm a gorgeous (the words of countless strangers) woman who goes to the gym myself, I would never act like this.  As soon as you asked I would have said honestly I'll probably be here for a while, but you can finish up your workout while I do some stretches and a quick cool down. Or we can switch off after each rep", "Info: maybe she thought you were asking her when she\u2019s finishing so you could wait for her and ask her out.\n\nShe got freaked out. Kept her AirPods in to make it look obvious she wasn\u2019t interested, but that probably cause her to misunderstand you more. Kept repeating she was working out, to imply she wasn\u2019t there to date. \n\nSo possible miscommunication? So NAH if that\u2019s the case.\n\nNTA if she understood.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s gym etiquette to let people work in as long as it\u2019s feasible and doesn\u2019t disrupt the first persona\u2019s timing. \n\nAnd depending on the gym the rules or guidelines may actually require you allow people to work in. A couple gyms I went to in the past had signs posted reminding people to allow others to work in.", "You're definitely NTA but I will chip in by saying there could be a possible chance when you were waiting at first that she noticed you and maybe got uncomfortable seeing you just waiting and (possibly glancing over from time to time).\n\nNot that this is of unusual behaviour as I've stared at people doing their sets before even when not waiting for the machine and if it was another guy then people wouldn't even consider this option but maybeeeeeee this made her standoffish when you then went to approach her and she moved like TA.\n\nBut yeah don't feel no type of way bro, you're all good for how you acted.", "ESH. She didn\u2019t need to be a dick and you should have just walked away and waited for her to be done after she made it clear she didn\u2019t want to share instead of escalating.", "Asking once was fine. Badgering her because she wasn't working out as fast as you wanted her too was not. \n\nWhatever machine you wanted to use, you likeky could have dine alternative exercises to workout that muscle group. \n\nAnd your comment was passive aggressive and condescending. Maybe you didn't mean it like that, but it was. \nI promise you she talked to her friends or significant other about the rude abd pushy girl at the gym.", "ESH. \n\nYou both presumably pay for membership. As long as no rules are violated, you're each entitled to work out according to your individual preferences.  She's an AH for not taking a slightly longer rest period so you could work in; you're an AH for not taking no for an answer.", "YTA-There are other machines at the gym you could have used to work the same muscle group. I\u2019ve been at the gym before and been badgered by men insisting it\u2019s more important for them to use the machine than me. It\u2019s really annoying and ruins my experience going. You were at a public gym, not your home gym, you aren\u2019t entitled to time on any machine. It\u2019s okay to ask once, but asking repeatedly and getting hostile crosses a line.", "YTA. Polite is asking once, when you didn\u2019t get the answer you wanted, just move on. Do another workout or buy the machine yourself if it\u2019s that crucial to you.", "ESH", "YTA - how many times did she have to tell you no?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Truly and honestly, all I cared about was doing my lateral raises lmao\n\nI feel for her though and other women if they have to be on edge about men creeping on them at the gym but in all true honesty, that was not at all what was happening from me.", "I agree some people take longer breaks between sets and sometimes you just have to patiently wait your turn. She could have been way nicer in explaining that she still needed the machine but some people are just assholes lol. Asking once is totally fine but continuing to press about it is uncalled for. Maybe OP should consider going to a gym with more machines or one with less people.", "I never said nor even implied that it was more important for me to use the machine than them? People ask how many more sets they have so that they can time or figure out how to structure the rest of the workout.

Wtf?", ">buy the machine yourself \n\nA machine specifically for lateral raises will set you back at least 5k probably more in the region of 6-7k. A multi gym around the same.

He wasn\u2019t hitting on her, he was asking how many reps did she have left and she failed to give a decent answer and proceed to be rude to him.
