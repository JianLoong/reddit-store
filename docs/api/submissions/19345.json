My friend who\u2019s not a gym goer agrees.", "NTA - Your whole interaction with her seemed reasonable.  Even your last comment wasn't an AH move.

Perfectly normal gym etiquette to ask, and if she\u2019d answered normally by advising how many sets she has and that she\u2019d rather not work you in b/c she just wants to get them done, you now have the info you need and could decide what you want to do. I know most people either prefer machines or free weights, but if you figured she\u2019s gonna be another 15 min and you want to go, you could possibly decide to just use dumbbells and go home. But if she\u2019s only got one set left, you could decide to just wait and use the machine when she\u2019s done. That fucking simple. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to work you in, it\u2019s that she was being so goddam vague about it, leaving you with no recourse to make a choice.", "NTA.\n\nGym etiquette is if someone asks how many sets it means they are waiting.

She should have let you work in or moved on herself, especially if that's the only machine in the gym for that exercise. 10 mins is more than adequate to do 4 sets and have over a minute rest inbetween.

But escalating it at the end like that is never going to get the other person to get that they're being rude. \n\nIt should be well known gym etiquette that you don't just sit on a machine indefinitely without being willing to let others work in.  I'm a woman and I've definitely had people react badly to a polite \"may I work in, in between your sets?\"  Some people are just jerks and cluing them in to their jerkness never works.\n\nHowever, if you're a guy, it's entirely possible that she was so sure you were hitting on her that she wasn't really fully processing it.

So for her to hog it, and not give any type of eta is just eww.\n\nMessed up part is there were probably other people who were also waiting on that same machine, but probably thought they'd wait while doing something else. \n\n\nIm a gorgeous (the words of countless strangers) woman who goes to the gym myself, I would never act like this.

I'm not saying you're the A H because you did nothing wrong (apart from that last comment I think) but it is possible she was having a hard time just getting to the machine. At least in my gym it's like this : the machines are always being used by a bunch of big dudes and I never dare to go there, because they watch, sometimes they try to hit on you, and they are using heavy weights, and I'm not sure how to use the machine, so it makes me nervous. Each time I use a machine (rare occurrences) I feel on edge and really not comfortable. Maybe (big maybe) that could be what happened to her.\n\nMaybe that was also what triggered the \"I don't know how many sets\" problem. If she's kind of new and you obviously know what your doing, maybe she doesn't have a number of rep or sets, she's just working out until she feels sore, and you asking that question (with no bad intentions) made her feel judged or something. \n\nI see that you were just waiting for your work out and I do not doubt that, but just keep in mind that being a woman in a gym can be uncomfortable.", "She most likely didn't know that, though.

I was close enough to her machine for anyone else coming up to see that I was waiting for it but it wasn't like I was hovering over her or staring at her. Like I said in the post, I was mostly looking at my phone and only occasionally glancing over. I think I have enough tact to not actively be staring at someone.

Just something to keep in mind. Being approached to share equipment does make me uncomfortable for this reason and because it\u2019s socially awkward for me as I also have anxiety. I also just love the gym as personal time w myself and being interrupted is less than optimal sometimes, even on days when I enjoy chatting w people I know.

Maybe applicable here or not, but my personal philosophy is just to find a variation or just wait or pick a new movement pattern all together and fit the previous one in another day because I\u2019d rather adjust my own workout which is very easy and manageable in my opinion than make someone else uncomfy.

That way neither of you is stuck waiting around for half an hour or more while the other just sits on the bench in between sets.\n\nI've admittedly never done this with random people at a gym, but I have done it with family members, especially when living in apartment complexes with \"workout rooms\" in the community center, as those generally only had one each of the various weight machines, and maybe as many as three each of cardio equipment such as treadmills or stationary bikes.", "Sharing is when one person resting during reps, another uses machine. And then they switch.", "You each get up from the seat between sets and let the other person use it.", "It means that someone else uses the machine while you\u2019re resting, so you take turns.", "But I will say, after she said she didn't know how much longer she was going to be- you should have realized this was a losing battle lol.", "If that\u2019s the case she should stop fiddling around on her phone, sitting around, and pay attention to what she\u2019s doing. I can\u2019t even go to gyms like planet fitness because it\u2019s infested with people who are just sitting on there phones, taking selfies, and have no awareness of their surroundings. \n\nNTA.", "I do this too, especially if I'm trying to get a few particular muscle groups up. But also I'd be, like, mortified if someone asked to work in because I'd been hogging the machine for 10+ minutes. I can always come back to it...", "Same really, but there's an obvious difference between doing a number of reps with a small breather in between, and simply using the equipment as a seat to park your butt while you browse social media, pretending that time on the machine = results, instead of actual effort.", "But this doesn\u2019t involve doing something for more than 10 minutes with breaks to scroll on your phone and just sit there. She clearly wasn\u2019t doing what you say you do at the gym.", "Then move while you rest and let him work in then. This isn\u2019t an excuse to hog a machine bc you are slower than others. This is a shared space where everyone is paying, this is what we learned in kindergarten", "It\u2019s way less intimidating than you think. A set is just a grouping of lifts - so if I\u2019m doing bicep curls and I do 15 of them 3 times for a total of 45 curls, then I have done 3 sets of 15 reps. That\u2019s all - it\u2019s just terminology for grouping.", "that\u2019s why google is free and you can look up free workout plans on any social media app", "The problem here has nothing to do with her not knowing what she's doing.\n\nThat's fine, and btw most other gym goers would be more than happy to help you.\n\nThe problem here is the lady was an asshole", "It's one thing to have to add or remove plates, it's completely another to have to pull the pin and move it up or down... Like on a lat pull machine", "Yeah but it wasn\u2019t five minutes, was it? If you don\u2019t want to share, get your shit together and move the fuck on.", "That's fine, you don't need to let someone work in. But you should then at least give an estimate of when you'll be done, especially if you've been on the machine for 10 min already.", "Yeah, it feels gross, but it's part of living in a society.\n\nIf you can't deal with the incovenience of sharing a gym machine, go workout at home.", "Then get your ass in gear. You don\u2019t own the equipment. Either move faster or share, those are your options.", "So, most women have been hit on since we were children. I got my first disgusting comment at age nine. NINE. It only got worse from there. I\u2019m talking absolutely filthy comments from grown men to a child. \n\nAs a result, many of us are constantly on fight or flight mode. The way someone looks is no indicator of their intentions. I understand this woman being uncomfortable at first, but the moment she realized you weren\u2019t being a creep, she should have chilled out. \n\nYou are NTA.", "I'd like to also say that it's possible that she has an invisible disability. When I was recovering from covid, I had to exercise like she was - go at it a bit at a time and then rest. Her rudeness was unnecessary, still, but that's just another perspective. If she's disabled or recovering from an illness or injury, she may have felt that it was too personal to divulge that info to a stranger.", "Totally understandable, but if I may offer the perspective as a woman. Anywhere we go out, we're at risk of being harassed. Everywhere. Doesn't matter if it's the gym, does it matter if it's at home, doesn't matter if it's at work, doesn't matter if it's the club, doesn't matter if it's the park. We are at a high risk of being cat called, harassed, stalked, and potentially assaulted.\nWe are constantly on guard. 100% of the time. We can't even let our guard down in our own home all of the way, because there's a high risk chance that we could have someone break in, Especially if we live alone.\nWe have no idea of knowing whether or not you are a good person or someone who is intending to harm us. Because too many times have we not trusted our gut, and tried to be polite to not hurt anyone's feelings and then ended up hurt.\n\nHer being like that makes sense, it was rude but if that was what her thought process was I can totally understand why she was abrasive. She was honestly probably just trying to get you to cut the conversation with her and walk away, and the longer you kept pushing the more she probably freaked out.\n\nI don't blame you for trying to get onto the machine, but please keep this in mind the next time you approach a woman in a gym, if she acts a little standoffish or rude. Please try not to take it to heart, it is most likely nothing personal.", "If it's apart of your routine, it's separate and not included in your routine. If it's a part of your routine, it's included.", "If you were waiting behind her and not by her side she might have been afraid you were trying to check her body out without being seen.\n\nI understand if you weren\u2019t, but this is, unfortunately pretty common on gyms.\n\nYou were not the AH for asking to share, but maybe next time try approaching from the front of the girl so she can see you and where you are looking at, might make her less fearful and more comfortable to talk and to share.\n\nGood luck :)", "Tbh in my experience, if a man (a stranger) approaches me for any reason, 95% of the time they're hitting on me or making unwelcome comments on my appearance/body.", "It's not vain, it's diligence and fear. We can't tell the difference between whether or not you're a good person or not, because too many horrible people put on a facade. Look at all the serial killers that got away with it for so long, simply because of their charming personalities. As soon as it was discovered what they were doing, people couldn't believe it.\nLook at all of the people who defend criminals as soon as they come out with their crimes. They're friends and family constantly say \"I know them they wouldn't do something like this, they're not like that, they're not that type of person\" Because they act. Because they can hide it.\n\nJust about every woman is constantly vigilant in making sure that we are safe when we are outside of our homes.", "Exactly! \n\nAny stranger (man or woman) goes up to you on the gym they most likely (90% of the time) will want to ask something about a machine, a workout, instructions etc.", "Tbh given the unspecified number of reps and the like I'd imagine she doesnt go very often* and actually didnt know thats a normal thing to ask, despite having later said she did. If you dont have context, a random guy hovering around and then asking to work in with you can easily sound shady. \n\nTbh I know a lot of people for whom this is exactly why they don't wanna start going the gym. There's so much pre established lingo and etiquette they feel like theyre gonna get everything wrong. \n\n*i KNOW some people might go all the time and still not have specific numbers its just less likely.", "I didn\u2019t know what that meant till I looked it up right now, I don\u2019t go to the gym, and this is a reason why. Too many intimidating people.", "Men will use anything as an \u201cin\u201d to hit on us. We\u2019re wary of everything and assuming this is happening because it DOES happen. All the time. It\u2019s not vanity it\u2019s staying safe in the reality in which we live.", "It\u2019s not a great look to tell people to isolate themselves instead thinking about what you could do to be considerate in that situation. Sometimes nobody is being an a-hole and we all need to act like human beings", "No.\nI workout, and somet8mes I don't know how long I'll be on a machine. So if I say, \"I don't know,\" and the person keeps bugging me. I'm ginna be annoyed.\n\nEdited to add: and yes, sometimes I want to use a machine that someone else is on... but that's just how it goes sometimes when you workout at a gym.", "Exactly.", "Ten minutes isn\u2019t absurd", "Many humans, it's like saying no, why does she have to explain anything, she said she was using it and didn't know when she was gonna be done. Move on.", "I thought they meant more like anticipated it, not wanted it. \n\nI know women who are super protective of themselves and defensive in places they've been bothered before. Everyone has their own things going on, and I'm not going to assume how she felt. \n\nBut OP is NTA, as well. She didn't need to be rude.", "Her repeating \u201cI\u2019m just trying to workout\u201d I definitely got that vibe too. She was expecting to be hit on.", "ngl i also got that vibe, at least she probably thought he was hitting on her at the beginning when she didn't hear him properly", "Instinct and experience \nIt's not that she wanted him to hit on her, it's that she was expecting it, pre-armed for that conflict...\nAnd when he didn't she was offended it was a slight. \n\nIt's fucked up. Some people are like that. Looking for the attention, and the reason to complain.", "No one said she \u201cwanted\u201d it. She was anticipating it. It is something that\u2019s not uncommon. Women have to be on guard in many places, and the gym is one of them.", " Like come on had OP wanted to flirt with her he'd done so during the whole time asking her when she's finished.", "Assuming OP is a man, many women have had bad gym experiences so they come in armed with the expectation that any man who attempts to talk to them during a workout is doing so to hit on them.  She didn't want him to, she was anticipating having to deal with OP being a creep, so she was geared up for conflict mentally.\n\nShe's entitled to that, but if she was responding how she did out of that faulty assumption, the onus is on her to realize the situation is not a threat and the guy just wanted to know when he can use the machine.", "Cardio machines is 30 minutes if people are waiting. A lot of facilitates have this rule and even have it posted.", "I think the wait times are referring to the nautilus type machines where you move through the machines to get a complete workout.\nAt my gym, you sign up for the treadmill \u2014 I usually did 45 minutes before heading to the nautilus or weights.", "That's pretty standard for treadmills, but she would do a few reps then sit on her phone and then go back which is pretty rude", "Ahhh OK that makes sense. I realize there is a lot of gym terminology I don't know lol", "But\u2026. Do you really want to share sweaty hands with a stranger? I\u2019d rather not share either and wipe down the machine when done.", "Oh OK so like during your rest period they do their sets and you switch back and forth. I've never been to the gym so I had no idea what that meant lok", "10+ minutes on one machine is a lot. Unless the machine does more than one function. I used to rotate between two machines when doing sets so as not to hog one machine for a super long time. (I have no idea if that is good for you or not, just didn't want to take a machine for too long.)", "Sometimes if one of those buff guys asks to work in I smile and say only if you give me a tip on using this machine. I'm an older lady and need all the help I can get. BTW, they always do, it's like helping their mom.", "That was like a foreign language to me.  Yet I can name every shade of MAC lipstick & tell you what your undertones are\u2026 amazing what your brain can process if it interests you.  Also, are you really counting while you work out??  My ADHD ass could never, Id get distracted.", "I honestly just liked using the stair machine or rower.  I have no interest in being a gym rat, or lifting, or building muscles or anything of the sort.  I was just trying to be a little healthier but everyone acts like they are Olympian athletes. \n\nIts a culture & a clique that is def intimidating.  We all pay the same monthly fee, no reason to be irritated Im not doing reps or I slow down a bit to text.  I have the same right as everyone to use anything in there but its turned into, \u201cyou\u2019re not doing it right & I need this now\u201d.  \n\nIt makes us feel unwelcome.  I just only hope she wasn\u2019t thick or chubby cuz she\u2019ll never go back then, we already feel like we don\u2019t belong.", "Obviously. I don't see why we all need to reiterate this.", "I don\u2019t see why. My gym is big and I have never once been asked to share a machine between sets. And never heard about anyone doing that.\nCan I ask where you live ?", "That is excellent advice. For OP and anyone else who finds themself in this situation.", "She doesn\u2019t have to explain anything. Just say ok, while she rests, she\u2019s moves and he uses it. No need to explain why a rest time is needed, no one cares. It\u2019s thinking she gets to rest on the machine and scroll on her phone while others wait that\u2019s rude AF. Especially for more than 10 minutes.", "Agree, except 10 minutes is a really long time to be on a machine. Having no concept of time is not a good idea in a public setting where everyone has to have access to the machine. \n\nA set takes maximum like, 30 seconds. Even if you were going maximum effort (which you would be weird) and needed 3-4 minutes to recover, you'd still get 3 sets in. \n\nI agree that safety is important, but it is important to learn the etiquette of places you are unfamiliar with as well.", "Except, if she had taken out her earbuds from the beginning she would have figured out she wasn\u2019t being hit on. Getting distracted or losing track of time isn\u2019t an excuse in a shared space. Everyone paid to use the equipment and they deserve to. 10 minutes is plenty of time to use a piece of equipment someone is waiting to use. If you think you should be able to use it as a seat to get lost in, move, let him use it until he\u2019s done, then go back to using it as a chair.", "Lol, comment straight out of r/seducingwomen", "Maybe she should seek therapy then or go to a gym that\u2019s women\u2019s only. Her issue doesn\u2019t mean men can\u2019t ask to work in at a shared gym. He clearly said he wasn\u2019t wanting to use the machine, after waiting 10 minutes. If you\u2019re saying she isn\u2019t intelligent enough to comprehend what he was saying then she needs a guardian to go places with her. She isn\u2019t the main character in everyone else\u2019s lives and she needs to understand that.", "That sounds so tough...", "> No matter how ugly u feel it's like there's some perv who'd still hit on u...\n\nMan, idk where you live but this is absolutely not the case for me. I'm nearly 37 and never been hit on in my life. If a guy approached me on the street, I'd assume he was either selling something or trying to mug me.", "I'm just wondering what kind of gyms do you all have to worry about your safety during your workouts. Never had an incident of any kind in the ones I go to throughout my years of working out, I'm not from the US though.\n\nBesides that, your point is like going to a candy store and complaining there's sugar. Of course there are going to be intimidating people (if you consider fit and buff people that), that's the whole point.", "I\u2019m a woman who works out a lot. All of this exchange sounded considerate and standard already. Even putting pleasantries aside for both of them, there\u2019s nothing that should stop a woman from a two-word update or doing a quick estimate - it\u2019s part of sharing space.", "I didn't say to isolate themselves, I said that they may not quite be ready yet to return to the gym.\n\nPart of acting like a human being is following the basic etiquette of places, and realizing when you are unable to do so and acting accordingly.", "At the gym, it is", "agreed that a lot of gyms I\u2019ve been do have that 30-min max but it\u2019s really only if folks are waiting.", "I hear that, but you should then hurry up your sets so you can be done in a reasonable amount of time so that people aren't waiting.", "When you're working in with someone, you do your set, wipe the machine down, they do their set, wipe the machine down, repeat.  No one really wants to share sweat, but in a busy gym, you really should share machines.", "No. Usually are not just hands sweaty, and that's disgusting.", "Well it needed to be reiterated with her bc OP says he waited 10 minutes before he said anything.", "I'd like to think this way, then I got followed home from the gym once \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Lol\nSome dudes are creepy.

My bad, I didn't think about that. This is why I mentioned that, even if she WAS trying to learn about the machine, she should have been on her phone off of the machine. \n\nIt mostly does sound like the woman was being careless about her surroundings.  As someone who does lose track of time after a singular minute, I would have personally: apologized, gotten off the machine, and finished my workout after the other person and/or when I was done with whatever I was doing.

Dunno if ur being sarcastic.\n\nI'm not very pretty. I was prettier but not so much anyone should take note. Especially since I just wear ratty clothes and don't wear make up. Being female is enough.\n\nNow this gym girl was rude no doubt. I'm not a gym rat so I can't make a ruling on her gym etiquette.

Everything turned out well though?", "For sure. Have definitely done that myself!", "Normal practice for cardio exercise machines like ellipticals differs from practices for weight machines. There are usually more multiples of exercise machines, and they tend to be used consistently without significant breaks.
