My friend who\u2019s not a gym goer agrees.", "NTA - Your whole interaction with her seemed reasonable.  Even your last comment wasn't an AH move.  She seems more like the AH here but like you said she might be going through some ish.", "How do you not know how many sets you have left?? LOL NTA. Perfectly normal gym etiquette to ask, and if she\u2019d answered normally by advising how many sets she has and that she\u2019d rather not work you in b/c she just wants to get them done, you now have the info you need and could decide what you want to do. I know most people either prefer machines or free weights, but if you figured she\u2019s gonna be another 15 min and you want to go, you could possibly decide to just use dumbbells and go home. But if she\u2019s only got one set left, you could decide to just wait and use the machine when she\u2019s done. That fucking simple. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t want to work you in, it\u2019s that she was being so goddam vague about it, leaving you with no recourse to make a choice.", "NTA.\n\nGym etiquette is if someone asks how many sets it means they are waiting.

She should have let you work in or moved on herself, especially if that's the only machine in the gym for that exercise. 10 mins is more than adequate to do 4 sets and have over a minute rest inbetween.

But escalating it at the end like that is never going to get the other person to get that they're being rude. \n\nIt should be well known gym etiquette that you don't just sit on a machine indefinitely without being willing to let others work in.  I'm a woman and I've definitely had people react badly to a polite \"may I work in, in between your sets?\"  Some people are just jerks and cluing them in to their jerkness never works.\n\nHowever, if you're a guy, it's entirely possible that she was so sure you were hitting on her that she wasn't really fully processing it.   That may be where her rudeness was coming from.", "INFO: Gender? If you're a guy, she may have been under the impression that you were trying to hit on her.

So for her to hog it, and not give any type of eta is just eww.\n\nMessed up part is there were probably other people who were also waiting on that same machine, but probably thought they'd wait while doing something else. \n\n\nIm a gorgeous (the words of countless strangers) woman who goes to the gym myself, I would never act like this.

Kept her AirPods in to make it look obvious she wasn\u2019t interested, but that probably cause her to misunderstand you more.

I'm not saying you're the A H because you did nothing wrong (apart from that last comment I think) but it is possible she was having a hard time just getting to the machine. At least in my gym it's like this : the machines are always being used by a bunch of big dudes and I never dare to go there, because they watch, sometimes they try to hit on you, and they are using heavy weights, and I'm not sure how to use the machine, so it makes me nervous. Each time I use a machine (rare occurrences) I feel on edge and really not comfortable. Maybe (big maybe) that could be what happened to her.\n\nMaybe that was also what triggered the \"I don't know how many sets\" problem. If she's kind of new and you obviously know what your doing, maybe she doesn't have a number of rep or sets, she's just working out until she feels sore, and you asking that question (with no bad intentions) made her feel judged or something. \n\nI see that you were just waiting for your work out and I do not doubt that, but just keep in mind that being a woman in a gym can be uncomfortable.", "She most likely didn't know that, though. While her attitude wasn't needed, it's common for many of us to assume that if a guy walks up to us for seemingly no reason, it's most likely they will try to hit on us or be creepy/dangerous.

I was close enough to her machine for anyone else coming up to see that I was waiting for it but it wasn't like I was hovering over her or staring at her. Like I said in the post, I was mostly looking at my phone and only occasionally glancing over. I think I have enough tact to not actively be staring at someone.

I can take 5 mins rest doing a compound leg movement and still feel winded and i think that\u2019s pretty common whether you have pots/anemia or not, but especially if you have any medical diagnosis that makes breathing more difficult. Just something to keep in mind. Being approached to share equipment does make me uncomfortable for this reason and because it\u2019s socially awkward for me as I also have anxiety. I also just love the gym as personal time w myself and being interrupted is less than optimal sometimes, even on days when I enjoy chatting w people I know. It also makes you feel pressured to finish faster and like you\u2019re suddenly aware someone is watching you. Some people have been through SA or another life experience that has made being watched feel extra scary or uncomfortable. \n\nJust a few things to take into consideration. Maybe applicable here or not, but my personal philosophy is just to find a variation or just wait or pick a new movement pattern all together and fit the previous one in another day because I\u2019d rather adjust my own workout which is very easy and manageable in my opinion than make someone else uncomfy.

While I'm sure there are examples of assholes at the gym, the vast majority of folks are adulting very  well.  I sometimes read bad gym experiences and wonder if the victim of perceived transgressions is just stuck in their own head and thinks everyone is staring at them or silently judging them.  Me, I don't notice your form or the weight you're using.  Unless you're stacking on plates and lifting an impressive amount, then I gotta watch that.  \n\nI have to remember at times during rest periods that people may think I'm staring at them, when I'm just staring blankly, not seeing anything in particular, and dreading my rest period timer going off.  \n\nAnd a hoverer like you described?  I'd fist bump him, tell him great job on his progress and perseverance.  And follow it with a \"Imma need some more personal space.\"  A dismissive hand wave is optional (I'd likely do it).
