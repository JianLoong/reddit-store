My parents are grateful for it.\n\nHe is turning 16 soon, so i have arranged for a garden bbq party at my parents house (i live in a flat) which my parents are happy about because they love having people over.\n\nYesterday my eldest brother (m42) called me and has asked to find out where i am ordering the cake from, to which i said its a surprise he can see on the day, then he goes my SIL, his wife, would like to know so she can order my neices(f5) cake there and it can be picked up together. I was confused why they were getting a cake for her. My brother said he thought it will be great to have both our brothers 16th joined with his daughters 5th on the same day \"killing 2 birds with one stone\". (My neices birthday is 2days later) \nI got annoyed and told him how can they plan all this without even consulting me, he said he consulted with our mum and she was ok with it . I said that i was organising the party for our brother and it is to highlight him turning 16 as its a milestone and his school friends will be there too.  My eldest brother agreed they wouldnt have done a 5th birthday as big as the one im organising but they thought why not seeing as all our siblings are coming over with their kids too.\nSo i told him to chip in with the snacks and bbq meat etc and for them to come over and help me decorate the place. \nTo which he said they dont care about the decor and i should just do it how i would have anyway, and he said that i know his daughters birthday is around the corner too so i should be treating her too, he also had the cheek to mention that i should be doing it anyway because i have more money than them (not my fault im single without kids)\nI hanged up and called my mum and said she needs to get him to chip in properly or im cancelling the party and taking my youngest brother and my parents out or away for the weekend instead. My mum got upset which i felt bad about because she loves family gatherings. \n\nNow im confused wether to bite my tongue for my parents and just merge the two parties even though im spending majority of the money and effort into the decor and shopping etc which i would be anyway with or without the joint party.\nPlease redditors help me out before im the cause the cause of the family breaking up  because most of my siblings are saying  for me not to be the A in this scenario by being petty over my eldest not chipping in.", "created_utc": 1685637076, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xm7wc/aita_for_not_wanting_my_neices_party_merged_with/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I know you wanted a surprise party but given the change in dynamics from your older brother, talk to baby brother.
