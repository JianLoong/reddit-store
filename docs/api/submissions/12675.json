Your mom ITA for making you feel like it's your fault you dad wants to spray water up his AH too.\n\nSimply showing someone an ad, even if you know they're an impulse buyer, doesn't make it your fault unless your dad is not mentally fit to consent to such purchases and needs a power of attorney. \n\nYour dad thought the toilet was cool. Your dad decided he couldn't live without one. Your dad of sound mind and mental clarity decided to purchase it for himself to use. You are not your dad's keeper, babysitter, or financial authority. If your mom has issues with his purchases, that is between her & him and they should leave you out of it.", "NTA so does that mean you are responsible for anything you show your dad and he buys it? No, he is an adult.", "NTA. He makes his own decisions. And for once, it is a useful purchase.", "NTA.  That episode is hilarious.  Good for you for having a life imitating art moment.    You will honestly love your new toilet, and your mom will too.  Just look out for the toilet paper mob.", "NTA Pretty funny though.", "I love my Japanese bidet.  \n\nAlso, as an adult I make my decisions on what I purchase, and your dad does too. It doesn't matter what you did to contribute--he made the decision, so totally NTA.\n\nIt's funny that he can buy a car, no problem, but a toilet is where the line is drawn.", "NTA, this is a normal\nKid thing to do, my kids do this with their dad all the time.

It's true that your dad makes his own decisions and the toilet is no one else's fault but his own, HOWEVER, generally you shouldn't try to psychologically manipulate people for your own interests. Realistically, what you did isn't the worst thing in the world, but you should have been upfront and honest. Shit, make a PowerPoint next time", "LOL. NTA.   \n\n\nAnd not an AH at all for making a whole inquiry so that you could share your pun with us.", "YTA. Manipulating other people to do what you want is not nice.", "YTA only because you did it on purpose knowing it was manipulative of your dads character flaw, and there was no benevolent outcome you were seeking.
