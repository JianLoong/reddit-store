The next day after they left my girl and I, cleaned up she noticed that quite a bit of her makeup was gone so we looked for it all over the apartment. And she starts to freak out cause the stuff we bought was new and expensive, and on top of that, she was freaking out because she doesn\u2019t have a good memory, and a lot of times when she loses things her anxiety gets the best of her and she just fills like she\u2019s going crazy. After I get her to calm down I tell her to text her friends to see if they accidentally took something of hers cause all of their stuff looks the same anyway. And she does but they all say no.\n\nA few days pass and she goes over to her other friend's (M) house they\u2019re hanging and apparently, someone told her to look into (M)s bathroom closet cause they saw (M) using her makeup. And she went to the bathroom and in her (M) makeup bag was all the missing makeup she\u2019d been going crazy over. So she confronts the girl and tells her she\u2019s pissed off cause she\u2019s been going crazy looking for her stuff. And she hasn\u2019t spoken to her since. And honestly, I was angry too cause it wasn\u2019t like 1 or 2 things, it was almost 500 dollars worth of makeup if not maybe just a little more. And it was stuff that she used all the time and needed.\n\nGoing to now a few days ago her other best friend (k) had come out with us for lunch and at the start had a bad attitude with us for no reason we didn't care. But at some point (k) goes \u201cSo when am I getting my apology?\u201d My girlfriend \u201capology for what?\u201d \u201cFor you accusing me of stealing your stuff\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t accuse you of stealing anything I just asked if you accidentally took something or if you knew where I\u2019d put it cause you know my memories shit, I forget everything\u201d. Then she says \u201cI understand your brain is shit sometimes, but you should be a good friend and apologize to the people you accused of stealing\u201d. Mind you she didn\u2019t accuse anyone all of the text messages she sent said \u2018Hey do you know where I put my makeup cause I can\u2019t remember where I put them.\\`After that, she looked at me and said she couldn\u2019t do this and told me to get the bill she was ready to go and went to the restroom. So while she was gone I told (k) that she can go fuck herself and that\u2019s shes pathetic to say that to her and to never contact her again cause I was sick of her shit. I\u2019ll admit that what I said was a little much but this girl was the worst person I've ever met. And now her friends don\u2019t want to speak to her till we both apologize for what was said.\n\nShe's a little upset with me for what I said but she understood and appreciated why I said it. She just wishes this all would\u2019ve never happened. And she doesn't know what to do.  \nSo am I the asshole for what I said?", "created_utc": 1701939204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18crhat/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriends_best_friend_to_go/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you did was correct you stood on your GF side and defended her. If something gets lost in a bathroom it's perfectly normal to ask someone if they accidently took something. Considering the average woman that could be a lot of make up going around and easy to oups. TBH I don't think her best friend is as innocent in all this with her attitude. Edit: PS: it was sht of a so called BF attacking her memory issues. She accused no one she just asked. A good BF would be helpign her solve the mystery of the missing makup.", "NTA\n\nI wonder what that girl did steal. Since asking hey did you happen to see the makeup that I was using = stealing..

Talk to your gf about pressing charges for the theft.", "Definitely not the asshole", "NTA but the best relationship I ever had was with a man who never got involved in my issues unless I made it clear I wanted him to. He wisely kept quiet, on the sidelines, unless he was concerned for my welfare. He said that he never wanted to add to the problem and knew that friends/family often had spats and worked them out. Him butting in would have only made it harder to resolve. So, good on you for sticking up for your girlfriend, but it has made it harder for her to sort this out with her friend.", "NTA,\nThey're all stealing her shit, that's why they're so defensive.", "Don\u2019t get yourself involved into women drama fr\nLet your girl handle herself", "not the asshole imo, totally fine for you to wanna defend your girlfriend - don\u2019t think that\u2019s overstepping whatsoever. her friend trying to gaslight her is awful and she\u2019s better off without her.", "NTA", "good on you for standing up for your girlfriend. a lot of women (including myself) let our friends walk all over us and it is our boyfriends that can help us set boundaries", "NTA", "Info: did she take her stuff back from M? Why not press charges? Stealing is stealing.\n\nWhy is everyone focusing on your gf instead of on the thief stealing her stuff?\n\nNTA.", "Damn.  What else has she stolen?  And what was the excuse \u201cI just threw them all in my bag and took them home because I wanted them\u201d.", "I'm with you man. I like seeing that your girlfriend appreciated what you said. These \"friends\" sound like they're exploiting your girl's self-admitted weak memory, and trying to guilt her after stealing from her? Are you serious? If that's how it truly went down, you are both way better off without these fiendish garbage bags in your lives.", "I'm gonna say ESH (you and friends, not girlfriend). Yes her friend was being an asshole. However, it was sort of overstepping to say that without asking your girlfriend first. She's an adult and can handle it on her own, if she wants your backup she will ask for it. The friend sucks, but it's up to her to decide if she wants to continue that friendship or not. You've now stirred up even more drama in her friend group that she's going to have to deal with. I know you probably meant well, but likely just made things harder for her, and by overstepping into the friendship took away her autonomy to handle things as she sees fit.", "NTA but the correct response would have been 'Of course we didn't think you stole it, we were just following up with everyone that was there - we didn't mean to make you feel accused of anything and we certainly didn't think you stole anything!' \n\nThen forget about it and carry on. All too often conflicts come about from the wrong initial response - then we talk about the conflict and forget about the moment it actually could have been managed without any strain.", "ESH - Yes, you told someone to go fuck themselves, that's rude. Was it deserved? Maybe, but it was still unnecessary. 9/10 times you get a better result saying you're disappointed in this kind of situation, then telling someone to go fuck themselves.", "Eh... NTA, but like others have said, I'd recommend staying out of it until your girlfriend wants you to back her up.", "Nta, I'm sorry to tell you this but those girls are not her friends, they just see her as someone they can take advantage of", "NTA.
