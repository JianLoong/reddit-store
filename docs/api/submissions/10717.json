Let's break this down:\n\n1. The pair of you are secret FWB.  Neutral on its own, not everyone wants the whole world to know their business.\n2. You go up to Canada with her and some friends, with you as the designated driver.  Also neutral, common enough college trip for the northern states.\n3. You touch her in an intimate location, in a public place, in front of her friends.  AH move on your part.  You don't go around groping people you're not in a public relationship with.  I don't care if you're engaged to be married, if she's asked for privacy then you keep your hands to yourself.  (Though obviously in the case of engagement I'd tell you to find a new fiance.)\n4. Her friends call you out on being a creeper.  Perfectly reasonable on their parts, you *were* being a creeper.  Both from their perspective (dude who's supposed to be a friend grabbing her ass) and the perspective of your actual relationship (touching her like a boyfriend or public hookup when you're not).\n5. She lets them believe you were groping her out of nowhere.  Here's where she's an AH.  Letting friends think someone's a potential sex offender when you know full well that they're not is a major problem.  I give her some leeway on this one because she may well *not* have been ok with you touching her, but since she didn't tell you herself it's a bit borderline.\n6. You ditch out on the group despite being the designated driver.  I'm only giving you half AH points here because you did give them cab money and you were definitely in a tough spot, but that's still a dick move.\n7. They woke you up to complain some more.  Definitely them as the AHs here, there are better ways of dealing with conflict than this.\n8. You threaten to leave them behind.  You're back on the AH train bro, find a better way of communicating than threatening to leave people in a foreign country.\n\nSo on the balance, we've got 2.5 AH points for you and 1.5 AH points for her/them.  All y'all need to learn better communication.  And you need to stop sleeping with this girl.  You want different things and clearly she's not comfortable going public with you or backing you up, there's no reason to continue the relationship.  Find someone who's willing to acknowledge you public.  While you're at it, look up some information on explicit consent before you get yourself into real trouble.", "YTA. From her friends perspective you were the sober driver who grabbed their drunk friend, then when called out decided if you couldn't grab ass you'd leave and threaten to abandon them in Canada. Based on the info they have, they should have torn into you. You are an ass because you were sober and know she doesn't want PDA but did it anyways. That feels a little like you were trying to out your relationship with her. I was almost ready to call her an ass as well for not defending you to her friends.

I'm just going to clarify.  NTA for leaving but a bit of an A H for touching her like that.

If you're in a relationship FWB, friends, romantic it doesn't matter, You have to use your words to establish boundaries. The moment she clarified and he continued you'd be right he would absolutely be the lone asshole, instead she allowed him to continue until her friends saw and then used them to publicly draw a line that should have been drawn when he first touched her, if not prior to going out. Otherwise it comes off as she's fine being touched in public by him so long as no one sees but she didn't make that known until he was being criticized at which point its to late for him to base his actions on established rules. Using public and criticism to draw lines that should have been drawn prior IS an AH move. \n\n>to me, thats the crux so OP then deciding to bail is AH move\n\nHe didn't just bail. He left cab money, he didnt leave them stranded, he didn't  leave them to figure it out, he fulfilled his obligation of providing them a way home without driving drunk."]}
