But expecting you to stay and later do her and her friends the FAVOR of driving them when they are insulting and accusing you is entitled AF.", "ESH, leaning toward you being the bigger AH.  Let's break this down:\n\n1. The pair of you are secret FWB.  Neutral on its own, not everyone wants the whole world to know their business.\n2. You go up to Canada with her and some friends, with you as the designated driver.  Also neutral, common enough college trip for the northern states.\n3. You touch her in an intimate location, in a public place, in front of her friends.  AH move on your part.  You don't go around groping people you're not in a public relationship with.  I don't care if you're engaged to be married, if she's asked for privacy then you keep your hands to yourself.  (Though obviously in the case of engagement I'd tell you to find a new fiance.)\n4. Her friends call you out on being a creeper.  Perfectly reasonable on their parts, you *were* being a creeper.  Both from their perspective (dude who's supposed to be a friend grabbing her ass) and the perspective of your actual relationship (touching her like a boyfriend or public hookup when you're not).\n5. She lets them believe you were groping her out of nowhere.  Here's where she's an AH.  Letting friends think someone's a potential sex offender when you know full well that they're not is a major problem.  I give her some leeway on this one because she may well *not* have been ok with you touching her, but since she didn't tell you herself it's a bit borderline.\n6. You ditch out on the group despite being the designated driver.  I'm only giving you half AH points here because you did give them cab money and you were definitely in a tough spot, but that's still a dick move.\n7. They woke you up to complain some more.

That feels a little like you were trying to out your relationship with her. I was almost ready to call her an ass as well for not defending you to her friends.

I'm just going to clarify.  NTA for leaving but a bit of an A H for touching her like that.  If you're not committed and not advertising that you're knocking boots, you shouldn't have made such a blatant physical gesture.

She consented to having sex with you when you see each other in private, not in public. It IS creepy that you were touching her in public. \n\nTheir friends clearly didn\u2019t know you were sleeping together and you did that in front of them, what did you expect them to do? NOT defending their friend? I mean the fact that you were touching her in front of people is so weird, like you\u2019re forcing her to admit to her friends that you guys are more than friends and she didn\u2019t want that. You set up yourself for failure. Yes she could\u2019ve defended you but she didn\u2019t want others to know. It\u2019s her right to keep it a secret and you already agreed that it\u2019s not a relationship. You know in the beginning that\u2019s what you signed up for.", "Let the downvotes start... YTA.\n\nFor the commenters feeling so bad for OP, here's a perspective you might want to consider: they were at a bar, she was drinking while he was sober. He's the one wanting a relationship when she doesn't and wants to keep her sex life private. He touched her when she didn't expect it and when she was drunk. In that context, his actions seem off and like OP saw an opportunity to move their relationship in a direction he wanted.\n\nOP, you know she wants to keep it casual, and not to advertise it. So you decide to grope her in public, when her friends are there, and when you inevitably get caught, want her to save you from a situation you created. She certainly should have said something after you left the bar (depending on how drunk she was and how caught of guard she was, her not immediately speaking up can be understandable, but she should have cleared things up after some time).\n\nHaving a sexual relationship with someone doesn't mean you can't be creepy towards them. Just because you're FWB doesn't mean you have access to the other person as you wish. Since they're FWB behind closed doors, him groping her in public is not ok. It's not what they/she agreed. Groping someone out of the blue when you're not in that kind of relationship qualifies as creepy. To those saying \"she didn't protest, so it's ok\", you don't know why she was silent. How drunk was she? Was she confused and freezed? Plenty of people also freeze up in uncomfortable situations. Her not responding negatively doesn't prove anything, the only thing that would is a negative or positive response. Which is why the goal should be \"enthusiastic\" consent, not lack of protest.\n\nThis comment section is probably a good example of why she wanted to keep this private. I had a college friend who was more into casual sex in college and was FWB with a friend for a while. She had to stop things and finally stopped being friends with the guy because he thought that because he had sex with her regularly it entitled him to be \"extra friendly\" with her when he wanted. Some people at the time agreed with him (she never did FWB with actual friends again because of this mess).", "NTA for the reaction/response BUT\u2026.\n\nYTA for calling Canada a \u201clawless hellhole\u201d\u2026consider your open invitation to partake in our skiing and partying \u2018politely\u2019 revoked\u2026.asshole!", "YTA\n\nLike she isn't your girlfriend.

Spread the truth around campus before they start telling people you\u2019re a predator.", "You meant to say currently fucking someone, right?", "And if she wasn\u2019t comfortable refusing his advances?? This situation probably wouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place if OP simply ASKED her if it was okay to touch her in public. If she told him yes, then she\u2019s the AH for letting her friends call him a creep even though she gave him consent. But so far, I don\u2019t see any consent from her side.", "What? No. Just... no.", "That's really not how consent works.  You don't assume things, that's how miscommunications and assaults happen.  They were in a secret FWB arrangement.  He disregarded that secrecy by being sexual with her in public.  That's absolutely not ok unless he had *advance* permission to do so.  It's not really ok from a publicly-known boyfriend, but it's at least less likely to get OP branded as a creeper.  He needs to learn about active/explicit/enthusiastic consent ASAP, if only to prevent future situations like this.", "yikes!! Being comfortable with intimacy in the bedroom isn\u2019t consent to touch her sexually in public. You\u2019re right he can\u2019t read her mind. That\u2019s why he should\u2019ve ASKED her if it was okay to touch her like that in public.", "if they both agreed for it to be a secret, then it is what it is. \n\nalso don\u2019t know why she would be the only AH in that scenario either since it takes two to tangle and two to agree to a secret relationship.", "she was fine with him touching her until her friends saw it\u2026 i understand being a little embarrassed but don\u2019t just let them go off on him.", "That's fair on #3.  I meant \"privacy\" on the \"doesn't want to acknowledge the relationship\" level, not the \"don't grope me in public\" level, but on re-reading I realise I wasn't clear at all.\n\nFor #5 I think it depends on how long passed between putting his hand on the girl's ass and her friends pulling her away.  I read it as a fairly lengthy amount of time (\"she hadn't left my side\") such that she could have moved away or spoken to him privately, but if it was only a few seconds you're totally right that she was in an impossible situation.  Defend him and she outs the relationship she doesn't want outed, don't defend him and end up an AH.", "Hi! It seems you missed the part in the post where OP and this girl are private from their friends. They likely were unaware of this fwb situation. Also, just because she didn\u2019t remove his hand, doesn\u2019t mean she was comfortable.", "Even if they don\u2019t advertise it, it certainly seems like the girl\u2019s friends were generally unaware.", "It's not prudish to point out that someone you fuck might not be into you groping them whenever the fuck you feel like. She's a person, not property.", "All he had to do was ask. He's possibly put her in a position where she is possibly uncomfortable, and it could have bern avoided with simply asking for consent. I'm kind of fucking tired of people thinking the lack of a no is a definite yes. That's not how consent works at all.", "She never consented to anything in public. It's her damn body, not the OPs. I've been married to my wife for years, do you think that entitles me to grab her breasts anytime I feel horny? Honestly? \n\nWhat the hell is wrong with people here?", "She's a With Benefits.", "\u201cFriend\u201d with detriments", "Nope. She's just a fling now.", "FWB here always meant \"fuck with buddy\". We never took it to mean friends with benefits, hell, half the time we didn't even like each other. It was just a buddy to fuck with. Friends with Benefits wasn't conceptually a thing until later for us. /shrug", "Maybe she thinks she can do better but hasn\u2019t found it yet so she uses the OP. that would explain why she said nothing to her friends because he\u2019s her dirty little secret.", "Just cause op wants more doesn't mean that he didn't leave her in the FWB category. He can want more but doesn't have to move forward until she acts right. It's like I want the new Xbox but it doesn't mean I'll act on it until the price is right. Meaning, he wants more but won't press it until she stops smiling cigarettes. Or stops making racist comments.. Who knows, but at his age he may think he wants more but I bet he's got an answer now on wanting more from her now.", "I think she wants that actually. She's the one who refuses to see anyone else.", "This! He deserves to have a FWB that actually, at minimum, respects him. She obviously doesn't and is willing to let him \"hang\" instead of stepping up and helping him out of the situation right.", "Yes. You can be currently fucking someone and also act like a weird creep in public. \n\nNot saying that happened here but curently fucking changws nothing about there comment.", "Being FWBs there's implied consent, not to the degree of bf/gf or husband/wife but its still a type of relationship, and when told to stop he did and looked to her for clarification to be met with silence. If she wasn't comfortable with PDA SHE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO TELL HIM THAT and not people outside of the relationship attacking and berating him.", "Because only one person kept silent when it escalated to him being accused of sex crimes?", "Thank you for pointing that out. I did miss that he said they \u201cdon\u2019t advertise it\u201d. To me that reads that they don\u2019t tell their friends about their relationship or kiss in public. Putting his hand on her bum in that case is out of pocket, but so was her lack of accountability. As far as her comfort, I don\u2019t think she was uncomfortable until her friends addressed it. And even then she didn\u2019t join in on calling it creep move, ostensibly because she doesn\u2019t see him as one.", "Well, it sounds like she\u2019s giving regular consent to the exchange of bodily fluids. She didn\u2019t shy away from his hand on her ass in public. Sounds like she was fine with it, until her friends noticed.", "It doesn't sound like she minded the touch until it was spotted by others though. She didn't tell op off for touching her, and from the post it sounds like she was enjoying the same playful sneakiness he was partaking in - until they got spotted. And I do think it was on her to either tell OP off, or stand up for him in that situation. It's one thing to not want to go public with a fling, it's another thing to ruin their reputation because you're ashamed of being associated with them. \n\n\nShe liked him enough to fuck him, but apparently not enough to stop her from fucking him over. \n\n\nAnd I have been in a relationship for years as well. My partner and I playfully or hornily grab each other's bodies all the time. Little butt slaps, waist grabs, hair touches are all normal physical parts of flirting with a partner. I'm not suggesting you honk your partners tits in public, I'm saying a cute lil butt slap is a perfectly acceptable way of interacting with a sex partner. (also, my partner does have carte blanche to grab my breasts when he's horny and we are alone, and if I'm not in the mood at that moment, I tell him to stop and we move on. Not weird or a violation)", "Can't be a With Benefits if the benefits come with a chance of catching charges. She's just a With.", "Must be pretty good benefits", "This needs to be higher. Maybe \u201cacquaintance with detriments\u201d?", "Nope, She\u2019s somebody that I used to know.", "Where is \"here\" and who is \"us?\"  \n\n\nAnd not to be pedantic, but isn't buddy synonymous with friend?", "Yeah she\u2019s using OP for sure", "Yeah that\u2019s the conclusion I came to as soon as her friends started going off and she didn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019s either ashamed of op or has a nonsensical reason for not wanting her friends to know. Either way she let him get harassed and then got mad at him for doing (as far as we can tell) the most mature thing to do in that situation. OP chose to deescalate and even ensured they had money for a cab before leaving them. Again the fwb had an option to say something when op announced he was leaving and she chose not to.", "I mean the post literally says I want more but she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s just using him.", ".... How does one .... \"Smile cigarettes\" exactly...? \ud83e\udd28\ud83d\ude06", "> Just because they weren't public, doesn't inherently mean they can't touch. \n\nTrue, but isn't it likely that a secret FWB wouldn't want to be touched sexually in front of their friends?\n\nSure, either way is possible. But if you're not sure, then isn't the default not to sexually touch in public?", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to think she wasn\u2019t uncomfortable. I mean, if she didn\u2019t want this relationship to go public, why would she be comfortable with his hand on her ass in front of her friends. In my opinion, communication is key and OP should\u2019ve asked before touching her in public like that. She could\u2019ve been uncomfortable refusing his advances for all we know - Fear of confrontation, didn\u2019t want to kill the mood in front of her friends, felt awkward removing his hands because they\u2019re fwb didn\u2019t know how to voice she didn\u2019t like it? Trust me, scenarios like these are way more common and complex than you might think.", "Ah yes, because consent to sex in private means consent to doing sexual things like groping in public as well.", "Not a with anymore since he needed to extricate himself from her.\n\nShe's just a.", "Thanks. Now I'm singing \ud83e\udd23", "SOMEBODY!", "If she didn't want to be touch, then why by OP's account at least, since it's all we have, did she not move his hand, tell him to not do that and/or not leave his side? \n\nGranted, we are only getting one side of the story, but why would someone lie about being accused of assault when that is a serious, life ending allegation. \n\nOP wanted more, so he acted in the way he felt towards her, at the time at least. Secret or not.", "Not an a anymore either because he certainly can no longer touch her a in public.\n\nShe's just", "I don't know. Maybe she didn't feel comfortable doing that. Maybe she didn't even notice till someone else called attention to it.\n\nThe onus isn't on her to deflect his sexual touching. It's on him to make sure it's okay.", "I\u2019m just going to say it..she is not really a just anymore. She\u2019s", "She certainly felt comfortable letting her friends rip him a new one.", "I can see what you\u2019re saying. I just think that the entire situation is messy, and i do now agree, he shouldn\u2019t have touched her ass. But i do think allowing her friends to call him a creep and then being mad at him for leaving is an AH move on her part. He did offer money for a cab, and drove them back to school. Personally, if i was in the situation and all that happened I would have just left in general. But i can see what you mean.", "Is she even a she?", "I did miss that she was still mad at him for leaving. She is AH for that; she can play dumb to everyone CEPT OP.", "A hole?"]}
