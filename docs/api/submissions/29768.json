Her high school normally goes with the highest grade point average but it can be between the top 5 students if one demonstrates high academic achievement like winning a competition. My daughter was the leader of and won a national robotics  competition and being the top 1-2 students she was sure she would get valedictorian. But the school broke away from their criteria by choosing a girl who had been in a car crash caused by a hit and run driver. \n\nThe girl wasn\u2019t badly injured but her mom died from the accident and she went on to finish the year with good grades. She wasn\u2019t in the top 5 students and only took 1 AP class where as most previous valedictorians came from the IB or full AP course load. My son was valedictorian 4 year prior and also did full IB. So my daughter was really angry when she found out because she felt like it was unfair and also thought it was racist because kids and parents had been complaining only Asian students ever got the award. According to her the last 8 years it was always an Asian who had won and while my daughter is half Asian (so is my son) the school was trying to find a non Asian to appease the families. She said she would have been ok with the other 5 top students winning but to give it to someone with just above average grades when the criteria was about academics made her feel like she and the other 5 (which according to her were all asians) was discriminated against. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this is true and I understand why it\u2019s unfair and even agree with it to an extent. But the girl lost her mother and still finished the year with good grades and that should be recognized.\n\nAlso the valedictorian had been made public and if my daughter tried to get it overturned it would make her look like a sore loser. I did explain all this to her and told her she was going to MIT already with a partial scholarship and everyone knew she was smart so she needs to accept sometimes unfair things happen. She was extremely angry at me for not going to the principle about this and my wife was also angry because she felt like the school discriminated against our daughter.\n\nShe is now in her first semester at MIT and while she likes it she says most people in her classes were valedictorians in their high schools and she feels like she was robbed when she worked so hard. I thought she would forget it but she seems to still be angry about it and not as close to me as before.

I don't love the power they have to arbitrability award something like valedictorian, which I always thought was based strictly on GPA, to someone who really wasn't in the running. Your daughter has every right to be upset, but what can you do?  Sure, you could argue for her, but you'd be painted as biased, and if it had already been announced, they wouldn't have changed it anyway. I just don't see what you could reasonably have done.", "NAH\n\nYour daughter earned it and it sucks that she didn't get this honor.  That being said, what do you do, make a scene to strip a car crash survivor of the honor and face the public backlash.  The optics are horrible... In fact the backlash you AND your daughter would get WILL be remembered long after the graduation while the other student being valedictorian will likely not.  \n\nYour daughter mentions many other kids a MIT were valedictorians and she feels cheated, BUT MIT does not grade you based on your prior status as valedictorian, it's what you do in class.  This honor will not change her application status (she was already admitted to MIT (congrats btw)), and how she does at MIT will have NOTHING to do with the title of valedictorian. \n\nI wouldn't blame her for being upset, but you are not to blame for trying to save your daughter from the grief of being a bad loser (even though she OBVIOUSLY is not).  If it helps, you can discuss with the school how unfair this was as a policy matter.  It may have been discrimination and it would not be unwarranted to bring it up without needing to embarrass the survivor or your daughter (or your entire family).", "My nursing school did this. One of the students got cancer and still finished, she was a good student but did not have the hugest grades. The student with the highest grades who should have been valedictorian was crushed.  The school is the asshole here. They should have specific criteria for this, other things can be awarded for their resilience or hard work but valedictorian is based on GPA.", "NTA - As unfortunate as that is, and despite how much she does deserve to be valedictorian, I think it's an important lesson in how life can be really unfair, and how you have to learn to cope with it. I agree in that I think it would make things worse if you and your wife had fought the school about it.  \nIt seems like a world-ending injustice to her now, but she will move on eventually. It just might take a while.", "I doubt there was anything you could do, given the fact the school had shown a history of making a discretionary choice for valedictorian. As for her being cooler toward you, she is now in university. Her life has expanded beyond the focus of her family, and what you perceive as coolness might actually be part of a natural development toward being an independent adult.\n\nA Dad can\u2019t fix things forever. At some point the child must stand on their own and accept life blows in their own.", "What could you have done? The only thing would have been to try to make such a big nuisance of yourself publicly and internally that they give in just to make the headache go away. I doubt it would work. And as you recognized, you'd be ripping the award away from this poor girl who lost her mother and still pulled through the school year. Wouldn't be surprised if that ended up making national news, since it'd certainly play to reader's emotions.\n\nNTA\n\nFor one thing, it's just one of many times life will show her that even if you do everything right, life can screw you over.\n\nFor another, *she's in MIT!* Nobody is going to give a shit about whether she was val; they're going to look at her college performance. Whether or not she goes to graduate school, when she enters the workforce, a few years down the line nobody is going to give a shit about her going to MIT. Once you've worked a few years, your performance is what employers care about.", "&#x200B;\n\nI worked at MIT. Honestly, the students aren't all that interested in HS goings on. They are more focused on the here and now - maybe making future plans.\n\nThere's mental health help if she wants to cry it out with a therapist, get some different ways of thinking on it.\n\nI mean, it's OK to be bitter, but you shrug and move on.", "NTA. A situation like that, where you/your daughter try to strip a girl who\u2019s survived a car crash and parental loss of the title, absolutely would have made the news and gone viral. I\u2019m a PR professional and former journalist, so, my prediction on how it would have gone down? Badly, for her. \n\nShe\u2019d get NO public sympathy when it became known she\u2019d already been accepted to MIT. The perception, fairly or unfairly, would be \u201cwhat more does this kid want?!\u201d And on the heels of the Supreme Court dismantling affirmative action, your family/she would have also been exposed to racist abuse online. \n\nThere\u2019s literally no way a fight like that does anything for your daughter\u2019s future. Because if she\u2019d pushed it, sure, she might have gotten the title but she\u2019d have lost SO many opportunities. Maybe if you explained it to her in these terms, she\u2019ll see why it was smart you held your peace. \n\nDoes it suck that school deviated from its usual procedures? Yes. Was she robbed? Likely. Is your wife right about the racism angle? Also likely and in no way excusable by the school district. She\u2019s allowed to be pissed and disappointed. Your wife is allowed to be angry. Validate that (and it sounds like you did.) Is it a lesson in what it\u2019s like to be a working adult, where you see people less skilled than you being promoted? Absolutely. She\u2019s got a bright future ahead of her and in five years, no one\u2019s going to remember it. Have your daughter focus on graduating summa cum laude. It\u2019s much more impressive on a resume than high school valedictorian, which most employers know has wildly different definitions across the country.", "I feel bad about that student who was in a car accident, but just handing out awards for life events is lame.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI probably would of said something", "NTA, as a high school valedictorian, I can say nobody has ever cared about or been impressed by the distinction. She's already at MIT, focus on the future and leave HS in the past.", "No, its a life lesson.  \n\nValedictorian in the long run will mean nothing.", "Damn. Your kid\u2019s school sucks. Your daughter has every right to be furious. She busted her ass and earned the top spot at her high school. I\u2019m truly sorry for the girl who was in the accident, but making her the false valedictorian doesn\u2019t bring her mom back. They could have honored her 1,000 different ways but instead stole something that your daughter earned. The only AH is the person that made that decision. You\u2019d have just made a huge mess and embarrassed the girl who got it.", "The only A hear is the school - they could have honored the student who was in a car crash in a different way.  By naming her (a student with okay but not top grades) as valedictorian, they are changing the meaning of the term and decreasing it's value from an honor awarded to the top student.\n\nI totally get why your daughter is still salty about this - my school did something similar to me when they couldn't figure out how to calculate in my grades earned taking outside classes at a local university my senior year so didn't include me, even though I was the top student.  I'm still salty decades later.  Meanwhile, last I heard, our valedictorian was working at McDonalds.  Nothing wrong with honest work, but you'd expect a valedictorian to be doing a bit more!", "Nobody will care who it was in a few years", "NTA - I don\u2019t even remember who my valedictorian was.", "YTA - I'm not saying you're an AH because you didn't fight, but the fact is your daughter was robbed of something she worked really hard for. You did the right thing because the optics are terrible, but you don't seem very supportive of your daughter. She's clearly smarting because she gets to the endzone only to find the moved the goal posts to another field.\n\nYeah, I'm pretty sure there was a healthy dose of racism there as well.\n\nI would ask the school: Is this how it is now? valedictorian goes to the person who graduated with the biggest sob story? I have to wonder about the kid in the middle of the class that lost both his parents 2 years ago, why didn't he get recognized? \n\nI think the school is the real asshole here and the racists if that was part of it.\n\nAnyway, your daughter was hurt, you could be a little empathetic.", "Valedictorian here.  In the long run, nobody cares.  I use it as my \"little known fact\" about myself at company ice-breakers.\n\nSmall school.  My best friend didn't rank as high and his parents (helicopters) complained.  They had a point - he took fewer classes in his senior year so he could sleep in and it counted against him.  The school stood their ground.  He got over it.\n\nMy kid's school (2400 students) has no valedictorian.  They pick a \"student representative\" to give a speech.\n\nNTA for you.  Daughter needs to grow up.", "Even if you complained, would it have made a difference anyway? Do you have the much pull? Even if it wasn\u2019t the car crash survivor, it may not have been your daughter either. \n\nYou keep saying the girl they chose wasn\u2019t in the top 5. Was she in the top 10? 20? Maybe they wanted to recognize and emphasize courage and resilience that year, along with academics (doesn\u2019t sound like recipient was a dunce) bc my God, showing up to school, much less performing after your mother was killed in a violent accident that could have also taken your own life is an enormous feat! That poor girl. Your daughter wanted her to be stripped of that after what she already went through? She earned her spot at a top school and got a scholarship, good for her! Let the poor girl have valedictorian, she gets to keep her mother and admission to a great school. \n\nThis is a lesson in life can be unfair and also she could show more grace and compassion and drop her entitlement.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA- If you or your daughter had fought this, you would've been social pariahs. Not a good look to take that honor away from the car crash victim who lost her mother.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the school did wrong. Valedictorian is an academic achievement, not a sob story contest. They could've recognized her some other way that didn't shaft 5 people who were actually deserving of it.

There will always be someone who gets the pity vote - oh, my parents got divorced, my parent died, I was badly injured in an accident, etc.- and they get a pass either to receive something they did not deserve or to get out of something they did.\n\nShould you have advocated for your child?  Yes, but it's too late now.  Oh, and another consideration is that, in some states, the valedictorian of a high school class gets free tuition or similar benefits at college.  So, you may have cost your child that too.\n\nThe best thing you can do is apologize heartily to your daughter for not having her back and pay for her college in totality.

It's been five years, and I'm still upset about it, but it really has not affected my future, and definitely did not affect my grades/friendships in college. \n\nYour daughter has every right to be upset about this, but in no way is it realistic for you to go to the admin and get them to change the verdict. Unfortunately, this is how life goes sometimes. We get robbed of the things we worked so hard towards.

This was a guy who talked to himself all the time, poor hygiene, he was nice enough when you discussed things with him but he had an air of superiority when you got into a topic he liked. I wasn't tight with him, held no ill will against him, probably wouldn't let him drive my car or come to my house kinda guy. His breaking point was (apparently) couldn't get a girlfriend, a girl had turned him down a few days before. He had been a transfer student midway through our junior year, so we had known him for about a year at the time this happened.\n\nScarred everybody, we all had to get evacuated and passed by him covered in blood, broken, screaming on the ground. \n\nSo when they brought him out at graduation to this huge round of applause, I remember looking around at the other students and we all were a bit, perplexed? I guess? None of us knew this was going to happen, he didn't graduate for a year after we had graduated, it was an odd thing at the time. My buddy was pissed because the incident gave his GF nightmares for weeks after the fact, he definitely didn't feel it was earned for something \"so selfish, to reward the guy who inflicted that on us\"\n\nBut looking back, he needed that moment a lot more than we did. That's the lesson I'd take from this for your daughter.

She's quite right to be pissed still about it, and at you for not fighting for her.  Don't expect that to go away soon, if ever.

Your daughter worked extremely hard to become top of her year, and lost the Valedictorian to another student out of racism/sympathy. She has every right to be annoyed, and if any of my children where in the same situation I'd be angry on their behalf.", "YTA, that is some cry-baby reasoning to choose a valedictorian. The competition is about being the best academically not the biggest charity case.", "I think this is a really hard one to judge because some people want nothing more than to be a valedictorian and for them to work so hard throughout school to try and achieve that and be in the top five to be considered is a fantastic achievement for that then to be taken away because somebody has suffered a severe tragedy can be very disheartening.\n\n\nWhat that poor young girl has gone through is heartbreaking and is truly a tragic event, but by the sounds of it, she wouldn't even be considered at all to be valedictorian and the only reason she was chosen was because she suffered such a tragic accident which is amazing that people thought of her at such a horrible time, but it's also not fair on the people who have worked so hard to even be considered for valedictorian and it can make their efforts seem like it was pointless.\n\n\nAnd as for the parents who are crying and complaining about their children not being considered and it's only the Asians well maybe the teachers need to tell those parents that if their children work harder they might be able to be considered and if it so happens that Asians are doing better than tough. They can't not pick them because it upsets other people.\n\n\nYour daughter has got a right to feel upset about it and one of the reasons she might feel more upset about it is because her brother was valedictorian so she just wants to follow in his footsteps and she feels like that has been taken away from her because of a tragic unfortunate event.\n\nI am going to have to say NAH other than the parents complaining about race", "NTA this is a powerful lesson for your daughter. Life is not fair and wasting your time being bitter about it simply makes your own life less enjoyable. \n\nShe also seems to really lack empathy for the chosen girl. I bet you that this girl would much rather have her mum alive than being valedictorian. The fact that she has been able to function as well as she has (with her average grades) is testament to her resilience and so I suspect that she has earned it. \n\nFamilies complaining to the school about the previous Asian winners are AHs.\n\nI would focus on trying to get your daughter to grow and see what life has been like for the other girl", "NTA.\n\nSeems like the school is sending a message that grades aren\u2019t always the most important measure of a person - sometimes resilience is. \n\nYour daughter would learn a good lesson here to be resilient in the face of this adversity. Others have suffered much more.", "YTA - you didn't have your child's back when she was treated unfairly.  Good lesson for her to learn.", "NAH", "NAH. She has a right to hold that anger. She was robbed of a hard earned award. There has been no recognition and no compensation.

But who wants to be the jerk that does that to a kid with a dead mom? Out of curiosity, are you the white parent? Because if I had a white dad, and he didn\u2019t stick up for me when I\u2019m probably being racially discriminated against, of course I\u2019d feel upset. There\u2019s a difference between advocating for your kid, and going in there and demand they take away the spotlight from the kid with a dead mom. \n\nYour daughter needs to suck it up.

So it was always a subjective decision who would get it.\n\nSecond, since the valedictorian role was publicly announced, she couldn't argue about it without looking like a total asshole for trying to take this honor away from *someone whose mother had died* in the car crash she was injured in. \n\nI think I would have done what you did (explain the \"life isn't always fair\" aspect; wouldn't you rather lose valedictorian than have your mother *die*)\u2014unless I thought it really *was* racism.\n\nI think, especially if you have younger children, you should propose to the school that they select the valedictorian on completely objective basis, e.g. the valedictorian is the person with the highest weighted GPA, period.

To decide that this is more sympathetic than just another Asian with a 4.0 GPA is really fucked up.\n\nI think her attitude toward your is less about her lifelong bitterness about this/actually losing out on the title, and more about how you seem baffled she's upset at all.

Academic settings are racist and sexist and if she is going into STEM it's even worse ( when my stats professor was getting her PhD there wasn't even a women's bathroom in the math building).

At first I thought you were saying the girl who won was in the top 5 and they decided to give it to her because she maintained her status while also going through significant trauma; if that\u2019s the case, hell yes give it to her! But it sounds like she wasn\u2019t a candidate prior to or after the accident, so I feel like the school making her valedictorian because she endured a tragedy is just publicizing and prolonging her grief. I doubt she was comfortable with it.\n\nAs for racism\u2026 if the school normally grants this honor according to academic performance, and the top candidates according to that criteria are always all Asian, then obviously by default an Asian student will be valedictorian.

I do sympathize with how she feels about not even getting a chance. But what impact will this actually have on her life moving forward? None whatsoever. She\u2019s upset about bragging rights.

How does this even come up in casual conversation? I went to Duke, there were lots of valedictorians in my class I\u2019m sure, but nobody ever discussed it. At least she has a good story to tell when people are comparing their high school GPAs. (Again, is this something people do at MIT?)\n\nYour daughter\u2019s high school screwed up. I think most of us would agree with that. Lots of people endure incredible hardships in high school such as losing a parent in a car crash, yet almost none of them are made valedictorian as a \u2026 consolation prize? And the world keeps spinning on its axis, regardless.\n\nWhen you say that your daughter was \u201cthe top 1-2 students,\u201d do you say that because she was ranked #2, or because you don\u2019t know whether she was ranked #1? If she was ranked #2, it\u2019s possible she wouldn\u2019t have been named valedictorian even with your lobbying. So why dwell on this?", "YTA, for your fake terrible story lol. This channel has the saddest people in it. Mods should just delete these post", "NAH - you both have valid points.  \n\nThis entire situation is probably why my high school ditched valedictorian and moved to summa cum laude in the 1990s.  When everyone\u2019s grade point is over 4.0 then parsing who is the single top student becomes impossible to be completely fair about.\n\nThis is also probably a good time to point out how arbitrary grade point inflation from honors vs non-honors classes is.  Just because you know the game for hyping your gpa doesn\u2019t mean you worked the hardest.  There is also an entire discussion of equity vs equality here.", "Nah. The truth is, she will never forget. What you should do in this situation? Stay quite and listen. And if she blames you, then well, just stay quite and probably make her coffee. She knows that you can do nothing about it. The fact that she is blaming you proves that she thinks you care enough to listen to her. Yes, it was very unfair. And yes, her hate is very very natural. I understand that the other student had a car accident, and their mother died. But does your mother dying make up for your academic achievements, or lack of thereof? She was burning herself to the last shred, and well, look who got to be the valedictorian. She kind of feels like she failed somewhere. Dont worry, the disappointment will not go away, but the frequent outbursts will, when she achieves something even bigger. And i am sure she will.", "And by complaining, for someone already graduated, attends MIT. What do you think to accomplish?

Though maybe could have pushed to have them both.  One high school graduation I attended had a valedictorian who was voted in by the graduating class and had the salutatorian determined by academic achievement.

That award wont bring that girl\u2019s mom back, but I hope she thinks it made her mother proud.", "NAH.

But the girl lost her mother and still finished the year with good grades and that should be recognized.\n\nThe school did what they thought best represented the school and give this young girl something to help the future seem brighter. Probably not the right gift to give, but that was the administration's choice.\n\nempathy is a better trait than jealousy. In my opinion, pushing through such trauma to keep moving forward is valedictorian material.", "Yeah - the school is really setting themselves up to fail with this \"we choose the valedictorian based on vibes\" system. I can imagine a number of factors that might have led to that system, but it's still stupid and they're setting themselves up for accusations of bias. Mostly I am just really excited for OPs daughter to get another couple months of college under her belt and realize that whether or not she was valedictorian will have zero measurable impact on her life, and that no one (or at least, no one well-adjusted) spends a single brain cell on this kind of thing once she and her peers mature out of the \"we all just arrived at a fancy nerd college and are sizing up the competition\" phase of freshman year.", "Yeah this school\u2019s system is WILD to me. I\u2019ve never heard of valedictorian being anything other than the student with the highest GPA. Maybe if two students had a tie they would then look at achievements or other outside factors but to just like pick someone to be valedictorian is asking for trouble. NAH, the daughter has every right to be upset, OP is right that it would cause too many issues to try and overturn it.", "At my high school they stopped awarding valedictorian because 2-3 kids would be in contention, and the school started checking grades back to kindergarten, and when that didn\u2019t work it became a grade and attendance thing. So we could claim top 5 or whatever on our apps, but not valedictorian. They also did this because an IB student won every year and the AP parents bitched every year that their straight A student would never beat another straight A student. So the school washed their hands and said they would let the class president do the speech. \n\nThe year I graduated the would-be valedictorian was also our class president. One or two mothers still found something to complain about.", "In some of the local public schools it\u2019s common to end up with a multi-way tie with perfect GPAs and so they did stuff like this to break the tie.

That student choice award for a student who\u2019d overcome tragedy would have made more sense in this case.", "OP\u2019s daughter would also benefit from learning to let go of feeling that certain achievements are earned as a result of academic performance.

Will this impact her college education and her career prospects?", "The absolute best case scenario for OP going to the principal would be for the principal to listen politely, then do nothing and stay quite. Worse, word could get out and OP and daughter would be viewed as sore losers. \n\nBut the absolute worst case scenario would be OP succeeded in getting the school to make daughter the valedictorian.

You make the school draft a letter, acknowledging her status as per the GPA the valedictorian, you also get them to admit that they are not using grade point average, or academics into their consideration for the award this year.\n\nYou want them to spell it out .. not just for the people who got screwed over, but for them to understand that this might be the first student they\u2019ve screwed over, but it\u2019s certainly not going to be the last group of parents to wonder why it\u2019s acceptable to take the award for academic achievement, and give it away to make the school feel better.\n\nThey could\u2019ve made her a special guest speaker for school, there was no purpose, giving this child this award.. they literally could\u2019ve made up an award to give to another student without using academic achievement as a criteria", "Yes.  You do stand up for your child who earned the title on merit and not allow feelings to deprive her of that.

There is no guarantee she would have gotten it even if the other girls situation didn't happen.

It\u2019s a pain that can\u2019t be explained. I was in my first year of community college. It took years to get my grades up. The fact that this girl managed to keep her grades up in spite of her whole world changing irreparably is amazing. Acknowledge to your daughter that it is unfair, but remind her of what she has- her family in tact. Car accidents are traumatic, losing a parent and you escaping with no injuries? So grief and survivors guilt? \n\nPlus everyone is assuming this girl is white. I\u2019m concerned about the daughter jumping to making it racial as it reminds me of Asian students who blame affirmative action when Black or Latino students get in to Ivy League schools and they don\u2019t. If this girl isn\u2019t white and it\u2019s the school\u2019s first black or Latina valedictorian, that\u2019s definitely an issue with the school but make sure your daughter doesn\u2019t carry that resentment and take it out on any black or Latino student that does better than her. \n\nNTA. \n\nChanged my mind", "And even if someone comments on her lack of valedictorian role, explaining you had a classmate in a horrific car accident who was honoured with the role is understandable to any decent person.", "This.

If she wasn't clearly number 1, she might have been banking on an arbitrary awarding just the same to get the title, which would make it no more legitimate to this current situation. OP said top 1-2, so that indicates she may not actually have ended up #1\n\nMost schools do not award with consideration to achievements. It's pure academics. My own class literally just kept calculating out more specifically until they got one slightly higher- it was 0.0001 higher to get valedictorian. The school has created a system where they can add screens and past valedictorians, including OP's son, have benefited from that system when they technically may not have been the best academically", "Let her be heard - recognize this is hard. It won't be the last time it happens. If she was discriminated on the basis of sex or race, then I would pick the fight - but not this. It's dumb.", "That doesn\u2019t make OP the AH though which is the question being asked", "No. The lesson is that high school is stupid. The important win - getting into MIT - went to her. Celebrate that.

If that happened I don't think she is ever going to be able to go back to a reunion. Maybe she doesn't want to - but it's a 'win' that would forever leave a bad taste in my mount.\n\nJust let it go - it 100% does not matter. A girl who had something awful happen to her got an award that the daughter thought should have gone to her. That's not the fight to pick.\n\nHas she talked to the school about the scholarship? I highly doubt they would exclude her on this basis. Just a quick look at a handful they are called valedictorian scholarships but I can't find any that are not 'either be val or have x gpa'.", "They do though.

That's not how any of this is supposed to work.", "Did she, or did she not meet the requirements for Valedictorian?\n\nFrom OPs post, she did not. \"Doesn't matter if you lose by an inch or a mile\" to paraphrase an old saying.\n\nShe could've been Spicoli with a Pizza, or she could've been the #6 spot. She didn't meet the requirements.", "The algebra teacher I was talking about was a woman.", "[deleted]", "I think there are ways to talk to the faculty without burning the school down and calling it righteous justice.

The part I have never gotten over is that my parents couldn't be bothered to even *try* for me. \n\nThe situation was a bit different as we had a perfect three-way tie for GPA, and the school decided to pick based on who had taken the hardest math classes. I was third. It sucked. I felt it was unfair because I had focused on English, history, and foreign languages. Based on the criteria they chose, I was third. It wasn't fair, but I get it. \n\nThe part that pissed me off is that my parents wouldn't even call the school board. They told me, \"life is unfair,\" and that was that. I was especially pissed because I had a scholarship riding on being valedictorian.

At least I would have known that they did their best to help me, but they didn't. \n\nI won't say I have a bad relationship with my parents over it, but they know I resent that they didn't try, and I lost a lot of trust in them because of it.

It meant the girl was robbed of a full ride scholarship that she would have received and of course the boy didn't use. You can't do anything about this, but my opinion is that there should be some other bleeding her award that is held in high regard for cases like the dead mother, or the kid who is dying of a liver disease, like a \"distinguished honor\" oh, Lord, or something.

That being said, allow me to bestow your daughter with this semantic flip: \"yes, I was the valedictorian \u2013 but I agreed to let the honor go to some kid, whose mother had just died in a tragic car accident\".

The school can pick whomever they want, and they did. Nothing you could say would change any of that.\n\nI taught for years at a STEM-flavored university where most of the students in my class were valedictorians. Some came from tiny schools with a few dozen seniors, some came from massive schools with 1000 students, some schools went by GPA alone, some didn't. It doesn't take such intelligent students long to figure out that a word that is used to describe such  incomparable experiences isn't very important. Which is good, because \"valedictorian\" is obsolete once the graduation ceremony is over.\n\nThe word \"valedictorian\" comes from two Latin verbs: dicere, which means \"to say,\" and \"valere,\" which means \"be well.\" It's also the verb used to say \"goodbye\" in Latin. So, the word \"valedictorian\" means \"the one who says goodbye.\" And \"salutatorian\" means \"the one who says hello.\" The words are simply honorifics bestowed on the people whose speeches open and close the graduation ceremony. The fact that schools don't have universal criteria just emphasizes that it's not an award for the \"best\" student. \n\nTell your daughter that professors at schools like MIT don't care who was valedictorian, and her robotics award is far more impressive. And our opinion of them is what's ultimately going to matter when it's time for recommendation letters. \n\nAs for what she's hearing from other students, I hope she can take comfort knowing that bragging about being the valedictorian is like bragging about being the keynote speaker at a small venue nobody's heard of. At a school like MIT, bragging about being valedictorian after one's first semester is a bad look. Beyond freshman year? It's the academic equivalent of bragging about being prom king or scoring a game-winning touchdown at homecoming.

I went through a similar thing in my military career, and it honestly still bothers me, but it also hasn\u2019t affected my life much over the years. But, all that said, you do need to talk to some folks at the school. I get the girl lost her mom, and that\u2019s absolutely awful, and has absolutely nothing to do with academic honors. In some states being the valedictorian can mean the difference between a full ride scholarship and student loans. It can affect the college you attend too, if you\u2019re right at the cusp of an elite school. I\u2019m surprised the school did that, and they\u2019re probably lucky that you or any of the other kids\u2019 parents aren\u2019t suing them.", "NAH.

And yet she managed to pull better-than-average grades anyway. Sounds like a pretty great valedictorian choice if you ask me.", "NAH. This is unfair. So is life. This is an unfortunate situation, but maybe  also an opportunity...\n\nSomething that I think would be appropriate here is, rather than contesting the selection of the other student as valedictorian, your daughter could prepare a statement and schedule a meeting with school leadership (maybe you could be there for support) about the impact this had on her. She could even take this opportunity advocate for the inclusion of another award that might be appropriate for situations like this.\n\nThis is admittedly small potatoes in the big picture, but no doubt it means a lot to her in this moment. Being heard might help. I think modeling and encouraging adult ways of engaging with (valid) disappointment is the move here.", "I do think there was an opportunity to stand up for your daughter without publicly shaming this other girl.\n\nI think you should have gone to the school in private and had a conversation raising all of the issues you have identified (not following their own criteria, racism against Asian students, etc.) Ask that they issue a private letter declaring one of the students in the top 5, who were eligible by criteria, has also earned the right to call themselves valedictorian, and that they put together stronger procedures to prevent this from happening in the future. They don't have to say a word about it at the graduation ceremony, but at least your daughter (or one of her peers) would have the comfort of knowing they had earned it. I feel like the school would've had to comply. They don't have a leg to stand on, having ignored their own procedures, and especially in light of the racism concern. Surely they would see that they had screwed up, massively, and that they would go down in flames if any of the top 5 decided to sue, and try to walk it back.\n\nFor everyone saying that this is no big deal... maybe to you. But some kids have a dream. Maybe that dream is to be the varsity quarterback, or to make the all-state band, or to win the national robotics competition. But some kids dream of being valedictorian. Just because you think the title is meaningless doesn't make it meaningless to someone else. Imagine if you had worked hard for your entire school career and then they turned around and handed the award to someone who clearly had not met the established criteria. It's obviously a big deal to OP's daughter. Why is everyone so determined to dismiss her feelings?\n\nI don't subscribe to this, \"It's a great time for her to learn that life isn't fair\" BS. Sure, it isn't always fair, but you should try to do something to fix that, not shrug.", "Your daughter will graduate from MIT and go on to (grad school, PhD) great things. \nThe only people who will care about and talk about whether they were valedictorian are people whose successes ended there.", "You are NTA!

Now is her time to be hyper focused on MIT and competing her way to the top there. Not being valedictorian at her HS will have no bearing whatsoever on her chances there. Question: did she get Salutatorian?", "ESH except your daughter and the other girl.\n\nThe school for the obvious. That's unbelievably uncool, to both the top 5 who earned a very specific title that can be used on college applications and resumes, and to the girl who was given that title out of pity (and/or racism). I'd be so embarrassed and upset if someone named me valedictorian when my grades weren't actually top of the class just because my mom died. I say this as someone from an extremely small school (graduating class of 35) whose mom died unexpectedly in her senior year, but who also was valedictorian by GPA. If I'd made it out with good grades but wasn't top, I wouldn't want them giving me the title anyway just because my mom died. It was awkward and painful enough that people knew and treated me differently because of it. That wouldn't have made me feel better, or honored, or recognized; just pitied, like a charity case so everyone else could feel better.\n\nYou also qualify as TA, imo, not because you didn't appeal after it was announced- there was no winning that. Unless I'm misunderstanding the timeline and there was a space between the top 5 finding out and the announcement being made public, you did the 'right thing' by not making a fuss about it. But being dismissive of her feelings about something legitimately cruel and unfair definitely is an AH move. She worked for literal years to be valedictorian, and they gave it to someone who didn't actually earn it, possibly just so she wouldn't get it.\n\nShe's probably so hung up on it still because in her view, nobody took her side. You could have been empathetic and supportive while still explaining that there wasn't a good way to fix the injustice done to her without making it worse for her. Instead you told her, \"well, the school does have a point and you're still going to college, so it's fine, just get with the program and get over it.\" Not what you said, but that's how it would have felt to her. She was just delivered one of the most crushing blows of her life, and her dad blew her concerns off.

And, this whole prejudice against Asian students is BS. What, do these idiots think? Asians have bigger, faster and smarter brains, so \"It's not fair!\"? This is the most redicules thing ever. I understand there is a stigmatism in some cultures to work the hardest, don't take breaks from education etc. But, that doesn't mean they should be excluded, just because they work harder. If anything, it should inspire others to work harder.  On the other side of this, I have seen top students grow up and their glory ended at high school, where lesser performing students went on to excel outside of the confinements of high school. You taught your daughter that life isn't fair. But, I think this cost a very high price. Going forward, you should apologize to her, fully support her (as best as you can), encourage her always, and see if school councilors can advise or help her to shine. Her GPA should matter greatly. It really should matter more than the Valedictorian status. Her college entrance exams should also matter greatly. Good luck to you both. Don't give up on her, and do what you need to make it up to her. She needs to know that you are there for her, and will fight for her when necessary. You might even consider speaking to the school board to get this changed going forward.", "NAH \n\nIt sucks for your daughter but also I get why they did it (assuming it wasn't racist but was about helping a kid who had a really hard year have a good graduation).

You said it yourself.. other WHITE parents (like urself) were complaining that the valedictorian was given to Asian students In the past 8 years... but they/you are turning a blind eye to the fact that those students had the top grades and other achievements and that was the reason they were valedictorians. Your daughter is angry that something she deserved was taken away from her cuz of pity and racism.", "YTA, your daughter won the honor and you should have fought for her. While I agree the other girl should have been recognized in some way, what the school did was wrong.

This is not about being a sore loser, but the school did really racially discriminate against your daughter and that should not be taken lightly. If she was caucasian or black, she probably would have been valedictorian. Of course, trying to over turn this looks bad but you could have tried to convince the school to have two valedictorians. \n\nLiterally this is affirmative action in disguise. A lot of non-Asians don't realize this because it doesn't affect them. Also, I'm gonna reach out on a limb that you are not Asian and your wife is. That is why this made her mad and you cannot see it because it never happens to you.", "NAH. It's a good life lesson in many ways.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou do not always get what you deserve. You are often passed over for rewards you should get. Sometimes, you can get justice, but you often have to fight for it, and it will not be easy. If the optics are not good, if you do not have allies and friends, if nobody will intervene on your behalf, it won't work out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is especially true for Asian Americans. On impartial merit based awards, Asian Americans disproportionately get awarded these. More holistic application processes allow for partiality and bias to work, just like it does here, and in those instances Asian Americans get disproportionately lower rates of these non-merit based awards. Perhaps the school is failing its mission for incentivizing academic achievement here, and choosing to  However, the optics are bad. Other parents do not want Asian Americans to get awards. The Asian student has no support from family nor friends. There are no institutions or authorities weighing in on her side. There is no winning in this situation.\n\nYou have to pick your battles. Asian Americans are easy targets being one of the smallest minorities around, with little to no political representation and clout.
