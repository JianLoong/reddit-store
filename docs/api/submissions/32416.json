It's a bummer, but that's part of the deal.  Your friend needs to work on getting a reliable babysitter.  Everyone shouldn't have to rearrange their evening in order to accommodate your friend's children, even though I'm sure they're lovely.\n\nMaybe in a few years when more people have kids, you'll want to include them.

Including kids there next year isn't going to become magically easier, at least not for a number of years yet: the kids will be more chaotic and underfoot, not less, they're going to take up more space, not less, your guests will need to be more careful about what they do and say, not less, your house is going to be in more danger to and from them, not less, etc.  I suppose you'll have more prep time, at least? But it sounds like you've already decided that the entire vibe of the event is going to be allowed to change - just not in time for these guys to attend while it's still pretty easy.  \n\nNote that I'm not actually recommending that you allow them this year - and no, putting a 6 and 3 year old on an outdoor balcony in (I presume) winter is not appropriate, even if for no reason other than that toddlers can climb railings and have no fear. I would just be prepared for some blowback next year between the people who still want the childfree vibe, this couple potentially being pissed that they weren't permitted to come this year while it's no big deal next, and the difficulties of childproofing and fitting in the dreaded kids table into your presumably still small apartment.", "A 6 and a 3 year old would not sit at a table with adults. Even if they were well behaved then at some point they are likely to get bored and pester the adults. Also if this is an evening event then surely it would be past their bedtime.

Sometimes when you have small children, you don't get to do adult things. This is one of those times.  Especially with short notice. \n\nI'd say, given the time frame you set forth...she had several weeks, minimum, to find a sitter. If she has a village around her, she either had too little notice of the party to secure a village members help (quite possible given the season)...or she didn't bother asking anyone and figured she'd strong arm her way in with them at the last minute...and I give it 50/50 odds on either scenario. Actually...I just reread...I give 80/20 odds on strong arming since this is a yearly thing.", "You're NTA but it's kind of odd the kids are 6 and 3 and you've never met them?", "Youre right, I'm just a very anxious/people pleaser and wasn't sure if I was just being un-empathetic.", "She sent the message in a group chat with some other guests which made me feel extremely uncomfortable that I would be saying no to her in front of them.

OP is not an asshole but she should not be shocked the friend reached out again when she was never given a proper response. \"That's a shame\" is not a direct enough response to, \"I can't find a sitter and we can't come unless the kids are invited.\" \n\nPeople create so many more problems by not being direct. \"I'm sorry but the event is not suitable for young kids so you won't be able to bring the girls along.

I'm just anxious and worried I was being un-empathetic to her situation.", "Thats kind of what my main worry was, it's not a completely child free event because the new born is coming, however the new born will be in the parents arms the entire time, doesn't require a seat or food and realistically at 7 weeks we don't have to alter our behaviour around it...", "You can empathize while saying No. You\u2019re going to need to use your words OP, your guests aren\u2019t psychic.", "I don't know why she can't come and leave the husband at home, we have a friend in our friendship group whose kids 'sleep schedule is very rigid.

There's a big difference between newborns and children.", "Your friend is an asshole.\n\nEveryone knows full well that a party changes completely if it has a 6 year old at it vs entirely adults.

That was kind of why I made this post actually, I wanted broader opinions on if I was just not being empathetic to their needs and if I needed to change my approach. \nA few of my friends have started having kids and I absolutely love hanging out with them, but there are definitely some events that just aren't kid friendly.", "We have another Christmas brunch on Sunday that kids are invited too, with a larger group so I said I'd just see them there.. its an odd situation.", "Think of all the child free people who will be DIS pleased if a couple of kids are dropped into what is supposed to be an adults only event at the last minute.", "That\u2019s very pushy of your friend. But you still need to provide a firm no. NTA", "She said \"we can't find a sitter so we won't be able to come\" which I thought meant she'd accepted that, I was shocked when she sent the second message asking if they could come tbh.", "I too would have thought that 'That's a shame,' is an acceptable response to her announcing that she WASN'T coming because the sitter fell through.\n\nIt wasn't a question.  It was a statement about not coming.  She didn't say, 'Our sitter fell through and I'm having trouble finding a new one.  I know this is a child free even  and we really want to come...' and left it open and you said, 'That's a shame.'  That would be ambiguous.\n\nThe thing is, some people are quite black and white and read things for what they are.  But others want you to read between their blurry lines.\n\nI would question whether they were trying to manipulate the situation to get what they wanted without having to be blunt about it.  And using your weakness (as a people pleaser who finds it hard to say no) to get what they wanted.\n\nThere's a part of me that would question whether there is a neurodiversity at play with you with some of your responses.  Nothing wrong with that, it's just a different way of thinking but if it's there, it may help you navigate your social circle a bit better knowing what's happening and how you respond.", "Do people not have any awareness anymore??\nI don\u2019t know why you were downvoted so much. Basically if I even see anybody hesitate to reply, I get it. It\u2019s not ok to do what I\u2019m suggesting, not to mention saying \u2018that\u2019s a shame\u2019.  I think you were trying to be polite. God forbid we glean meanings on messages from social cues\ud83d\ude44", "No. Parenting isn't 'fair'. I am a parent, and sometimes That Man I Married (term of endearment) and I had to switch off going places if we couldn't find childcare. Them's the breaks. Friend is being unreasonable. You can be empathetic without being accommodating in this particular instance, because you simply cannot accommodate. You do not have the space.\n\nTo be honest, even if you did have the space, the event is effectively adult-only (aside from the babe in arms) and unsuitable for the children. \n\nI know it's hard to stand up for yourself, and I'm proud of you. Go forth and be happy!", "She said they're both friends with us and it would be unfair for them to have to choose who came and who stayed home", "Your response should have been, \u2018I totally understand and am sad you can\u2019t make this dinner, I hope that we can grab holiday drinks soon!\u2019\n\nPeople pleasing others lands you in a space to disappoint yourself. I\u2019m a recovered people pleaser, and am **SO** comfortable with saying no now.\n\n**Only people seeking to exploit that pleasing nature for themselves was upset by that.**", "You're right.  This was her saying that she accepts it's a child free event and that she can't come.\n\nWhat she was likely hoping for was you saying, 'No, it's fine.  Bring the kids we really want you there.'  But she didn't give a thought to logistics and how her kids being there would affect the entire dynamics of the party.  This is all about her.", "Agreed. I thought the first interaction was pretty clear, but obviously she was still hoping for more, or hoping it was \u2018a shame\u2019 they would need to bring their kids, rather than \u2018a shame\u2019 they wouldn\u2019t be able to come. \n\nOP, let he know that you\u2019re disappointed they can\u2019t make it but you understand the difficulties people can have in finding sitter. It\u2019s too late to change all the plans but in light of all the extra kids joining the group, you will plan something more kid-friendly next year (assuming that is still your plan).\n\nI\u2019m sure she will get it. Alternatively, you could ask them to zoom in to join you from home, lol!", "There is also the option that one parent stay home with the kids, and one come to the party. \n\nMy guess is there was no babysitter, and they are trying to force you to let their young kids come to an event and location that is unsuitable.", "If you don't already see one, therapist can help with all kind of things. Right now my therapist is helping me work on my voice and assertiveness so I'm not such a *nervous people pleaser*. (Sound familiar? lol)\n\nGood luck on your journey finding your voice. When you really use it it's so satisfying and you'll feel more confident! DRUNK WITH POWER!", "Don't be scared. They asked if the kids could come knowing there was a 50/50 chance. Also, they have 2 young kids, won't be the first time they've had to miss a thing. They can also decide if one does end up going while the other watches the chillers. Heck, maybe they're kind of hoping for a reason to not go! It's a guaranteed 50/50 chance I won't use my babe as an excuse to stay in", "She's obviously playing hard ball just to have you cave and let the kids come, \n\nDon't change your mind, keep it as an adult's only event and I say that as a mother of two. It's important to have adult time where you get to be fully present with other adults", "The question of \"who goes and who stays with the kid\" is something that parents have to deal with all the time! Surely by the time a child is six, they know how to take turns/compromise, etc.", "Paper Rock Scissors. I have done this with my husband. Or if I go to this party you go and do this and I keep the kids. Or visa versa.", "She also refers to herself with a reflexive pronoun instead of a personal pronoun when she is the subject of the sentence but not the object. Gross. NTA."]}
