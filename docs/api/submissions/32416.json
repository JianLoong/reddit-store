I said thats a shame and left it at that. \n\n4 days prior to the event she messages again, stating that we should move the event to a different location so there is space for her to bring the children. I said no, the event is organised and has been planned for over a month, moving it at this date would be unsuitable. \n\nShe then says again \"well myself and partner won't be able to come unless we can bring the girls\". I was busy so didn't reply immediately and she messaged again \"so can I bring them?\" And I said I would let her know. \n\nAs mentioned, the apartment itself is quite small, so fitting an extra 2 guests at the tables won't be possible. I could possibly give them seats outside on a small deck that I have, however I haven't met these children and don't know if that would even be suitable. \nI have discussed with 2 other guests who have said children of this age change the dynamic of the event substantially, and they aren't the age where they can entertain themselves, add to this my house is not at all child friendly. They would have to BYO plates, cutlery, cups etc. \n\nI don't want to cause a problem in the friend group, and next year when a few of the group children are older I will make the event more child friendly, however AITA for not changing my event substantially with 4 days notice?\n\nEdit; spelling errors.\nEDIT TO ADD; thanks everyone, I've told her it won't be suitable this year and that I'll see them on Sunday.

Kids definitely change the dynamic.  This event sounds more enjoyable w/out children.  They don't have to be included in everything.  In fact, there may be some parents there who are specifically looking forward to an evening with just adults.\n\nSometimes when you have kids, you have to miss events like this.  It's a bummer, but that's part of the deal.  Your friend needs to work on getting a reliable babysitter.  Everyone shouldn't have to rearrange their evening in order to accommodate your friend's children, even though I'm sure they're lovely.\n\nMaybe in a few years when more people have kids, you'll want to include them.  Maybe not.  Either option is OK.", "NTA. People who don\u2019t have kids should not be expected to accommodate the needs of people who do.

You are responsible for the guest list. It would be wrong to add the children because it would change the event\u2019s atmosphere for everyone else. The longer you wait to say no, the more hope your friend has, and the more hurt she\u2019ll be when you say no. \n\nThe worst thing you can do is to delay the inevitable.

Also it would change the dynamic of the event. I wouldn't change anything. However, normally I would say that it's a childfree event so they should understand and it should cause no problems. However, you can't really say it's childfree because you're letting a newborn in, and I think that's where you are going wrong. Because they are going to think you let so and so have their baby, but you won't accommodate for us type of thing.", "NTA\n\nHer childcare issues are no one's problem but her own. She misses out this year.  Next year you can throw her a bone by citing her missing this year as a reason to include the younglings if that is what the group wants. \n\nPersonally I just let the parents fall away from my friend group until the kids are old enough to stay home alone.  They have little to talk about aside from their kids and I do not find conversations about diapers/bowel movements/children's television to be entertaining.

Including kids there next year isn't going to become magically easier, at least not for a number of years yet: the kids will be more chaotic and underfoot, not less, they're going to take up more space, not less, your guests will need to be more careful about what they do and say, not less, your house is going to be in more danger to and from them, not less, etc.  I suppose you'll have more prep time, at least? But it sounds like you've already decided that the entire vibe of the event is going to be allowed to change - just not in time for these guys to attend while it's still pretty easy.  \n\nNote that I'm not actually recommending that you allow them this year - and no, putting a 6 and 3 year old on an outdoor balcony in (I presume) winter is not appropriate, even if for no reason other than that toddlers can climb railings and have no fear. I would just be prepared for some blowback next year between the people who still want the childfree vibe, this couple potentially being pissed that they weren't permitted to come this year while it's no big deal next, and the difficulties of childproofing and fitting in the dreaded kids table into your presumably still small apartment.", "A 6 and a 3 year old would not sit at a table with adults. Even if they were well behaved then at some point they are likely to get bored and pester the adults. Also if this is an evening event then surely it would be past their bedtime. As a parent I would just accept I couldn\u2019t go rather than inconvenience everyone else having to put up with my kids.", "NTA. They should\u2019ve arranged childcare long before now.", "apologize that it just won't be doable, your small apartment is barely fitting 16 people. Maybe in the future with more notice. BUT if you value the friendship and want to offer an olive branch, maybe suggest that they and the girls come by for a lunch or supper the next day, casual, \"help me eat all the leftovers, I'd still love to see you guys...\" kind of thing....", "NTA it\u2019s an adults only event and you just need to be clear about that", "Nta and if they can\u2019t find a sitter they can\u2019t come", "NTA, but you have to reply to her.

You and hubby will need to toss a coin on who comes alone\"", "NTA, and they had an alternative---one of them could stay home with the kids, and the other could attend.", "Ad a mom of 6, NTA. Sometimes when you have small children, you don't get to do adult things. This is one of those times.  Especially with short notice. \n\nI'd say, given the time frame you set forth...she had several weeks, minimum, to find a sitter. If she has a village around her, she either had too little notice of the party to secure a village members help (quite possible given the season)...or she didn't bother asking anyone and figured she'd strong arm her way in with them at the last minute...and I give it 50/50 odds on either scenario. Actually...I just reread...I give 80/20 odds on strong arming since this is a yearly thing.", "You're NTA but it's kind of odd the kids are 6 and 3 and you've never met them?", "Youre right, I'm just a very anxious/people pleaser and wasn't sure if I was just being un-empathetic.", "She sent the message in a group chat with some other guests which made me feel extremely uncomfortable that I would be saying no to her in front of them. I don't want my friends to think I hate kids and that they aren't welcome at future events.", "Exactly. OP is not an asshole but she should not be shocked the friend reached out again when she was never given a proper response. \"That's a shame\" is not a direct enough response to, \"I can't find a sitter and we can't come unless the kids are invited.\" \n\nPeople create so many more problems by not being direct. \"I'm sorry but the event is not suitable for young kids so you won't be able to bring the girls along. While we will miss you, I understand if this means you can not come to the party.\" You can be polite and understanding while also letting them know clearly what the expectation is.", "I thought my initial response of 'thats a shame' answered her question and then felt awkward, but you're totally right.", "She said that would be 'unfair' as they are both our friends.", "She actually already answered the question the first time when she said too bad.

I could potentially put them outside though? I'm not sure if thats appropriate. I don't host events with children often and aren't really sure what's appropriate.\nYoure right though, I will reply today.", "Well put. I'm just anxious and worried I was being un-empathetic to her situation.", "Thats kind of what my main worry was, it's not a completely child free event because the new born is coming, however the new born will be in the parents arms the entire time, doesn't require a seat or food and realistically at 7 weeks we don't have to alter our behaviour around it...", "You can empathize while saying No. You\u2019re going to need to use your words OP, your guests aren\u2019t psychic.", "I don't know why she can't come and leave the husband at home, we have a friend in our friendship group whose kids 'sleep schedule is very rigid.

But she put this is the group chat to pressure you to allow the kids to come. She could have messaged you privately but didn't. She also should have accepted your answer the first time, but since you were vague with the \"it's a shame\" reply she thought she could push the issue. At least she did not show up on your doorstep with both kids. \n\nNext time something like this happens, just state \"I'm sorry you can't attend this time.\" No excuses, no reasons given, just regret.

Otherwise you're definitely moving into AH territory\n\nNTA", "Then they are being AH about it. Tell them to flip a coin who stays home.

You're NTA of you have to say no, you can't accommodate their request. I doesn't make you a mean person. I understand, no one likes to say no. However, busy or not it's a yes or no question and you haven't responded adequately thereby leaving your friend hanging.", "It also can\u2019t break or spill things. And I assume will be removed from the room if the baby gets loud. \nI have allowed friends to bring kids to adult events due to lack of childcare and have always regretted it.", "Agreed that having a newborn around is different than toddlers running around. Just suggesting that might be their argument. But if it is, just explain that you didn't have to make any other accommodations or changes by having the newborn there.", "Sounds scary, but you're right. Thanks.", "You might be right! I'll send her a private message asking.", "Youre so right. I was planning to set up the tables and see If I could fit in 2 extra table settings and let them know then but I think I'll just say no to stop them being unsure.", "Exactly. There's a big difference between newborns and children.", "Your friend is an asshole.\n\nEveryone knows full well that a party changes completely if it has a 6 year old at it vs entirely adults.

The fact that she keeps pushing it, first by asking in the group chat and not privately, and then by not accepting OP's polite face-saving \"that's a shame,\" tells me that the friend is the one making this weird. \n\nHeck, if someone texted me saying \"no babysitter!\" I would just assume they are trying to get out of the party in the nicest way and would've replied the same way OP did.\n\nAnd as someone else said, the friend could have her husband stay at home with the kids, or vice versa, depending on who is primary friend to this group.", "So can you just say \"there's not space at my place for more people, but we can catch up on Sunday\" then", "Even more reason why it isn\u2019t necessary for her to bring the kids to this one.
