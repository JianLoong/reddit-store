We have told nan that she can bring the dog to Christmas so he isn't left alone all day and we are going to do some trial runs prior to Christmas to see how he gets on with my cat who is slightly timid. My nan keeps insisting that he is good with cats but we feel that she doesn't really take into consideration that my cat may not be too receptive to her dog. \n\nI asked her if she still had her old baby gate from when she first got him and if so whether she could bring it with her on Christmas day so that her dog could roam free in our open plan living/kitchen area (where we will be spending the day) rather than the dog being kept on the lead all day. The idea was that my cat then has the rest of the house where she can rest if she doesn't want to be around the dog. We feel that it is her house and should feel comfortable. My nan feels that it is unfair on her dog that I want to keep him in the living area and said that if her dog isn't going to feel welcome then she might not come. \n\nWe feel that we are welcoming him but we are not willing to compromise my cat's comfort over the dog having more room for an afternoon. I don't want my cat to feel uncomfortable in her own house. I want it to be that it is my cats prerogative whether she comes into the living area to socialise or not and that she has a place to escape to if she doesn't want to. I feel that my nan is being a bit ungrateful that we are cooking her a massive meal and letting her bring the dog to our house and I don't want to have to feel like her dog is priority\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1699794988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tk148/aita_for_wanting_my_nan_to_bring_a_baby_gate_to/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don\u2019t backpedal or compromise. Tell her you will miss her at Christmas. \n\nYour request was a good idea, and generous. Her little \u201cgood with other animals\u201d dog can come but be safe, and your cat would have the run of, (most of), it\u2019s home. Not everybody wants a guest to bring their little rat dog into their home, timid resident cat or not.\n\nGuests don\u2019t get to make the rules in your home. No matter how old they are, or if they are related, or even if you love them. NTA", "NTA. \n\nWhat you have proposed is totally reasonable. \n\nPlease don\u2019t back down. If she wants to threaten she won\u2019t come unless she gets her way, let it happen. She will sit at home alone and realize how childish she is acting, then maybe come around. \n\nJust because people are old, doesn\u2019t mean they get to bully people to submit.", "NTA, OP. \n\nMy husband's relative showed up unannounced one morning and brought along her big boisterous dog who is \"good with other dogs.\" That's great for her and her dog, but our dog...well, isn't. She not aggressive or bitey, but she's been nervous her whole life due to multiple instances of abuse before she was rescued and we adopted her. When a 70-pound bouncy ball of happy-go-lucky came romping through the door, our 25 pounds of anxiety promptly froze in terror, shrank into a ball and pee'd on the carpet. We'd had zero time to prepare, and had to emergency juggle getting the big dog out, our dog calmed down and reassured that she wasn't in trouble for messing the house, and cleaning up the urine, while the relative flustered about fussing and doing nothing helpful.\n\nPeople who insist that \"their pet is so good with others\" are selfish and clueless that it's a 2-part relationship: the \"other\" also has to be comfortable with the pet in question. \n\nOP, buy your own puppy gate. Yes, it's unfair that you have to shell out money to manage the situation, but I would not trust Nan to bring her own, as she is already being stubborn about it. If she brings it - great, a pleasant surprise. If she doesn't, and is relying on \"it's the holidays\" and your sense of guilt to allow her in despite the lack of adhering to the agreement, then you will already have your back up plan ready to go. Just be prepared for her to equally conveniently forget to close the gate after her.", "NTA   Why do dog owners always tell cat owners that their dog likes cats????  That\u2019s not the issue - cats are generally afraid of dogs, whether or not the dog likes them!  Just go to a thrift store and get your own baby gate.  Your nan is being ridiculous.  Why does her dog need access to every room in your house?", "NTA - You are accommodating your grandmother by allowing her to bring her dog with her but asking her to take a reasonable precaution since there already is a cat living in the home. If she doesn't want the dog restricted if they don't get a long, she can either miss Christmas Dinner or leave the dog at home.", "Even if you didn\u2019t have a cat its entirely reasonable to not want someone\u2019s dog having free reign all over your house. \nAllowing them to bring a dog and allowing dog access to the living and kitchen areas where I\u2019d assume most guests will be anyone is more than generous NTA", "NTA - If she says she's going to stay home because of it, I would just say something lightly like \"Oh that's a shame, but you should do what you feel is best\" All the while, doing what you feel is best as well :)", "NTA your house your rules. If your mom isn't going to take in consideration the cat and see how they get along first she can deal. It's not like you are telling her to put the dog in a crate all day.", "NTA. Your request is totally reasonable. Even if he\u2019s \u2018good with cats\u2019, that\u2019s irrelevant if your cat turns out to not be good with dogs. If she\u2019s not able to bring the gate (for example if it\u2019s too big to reasonably fit in the car), then you could offer to get one to make peace, but if she just doesn\u2019t want to, then your pet takes priority over hers.", "NTA. Why do so many people with dogs act like their dog is allowed places just because THEY want them to be? \n\nOP, this is YOUR house not your nan's. She doesn't get to dictate whether there will be a baby gate or if her dog interacts with your cat. Rescind your offer of letting the dog come and tell her you'll see her some other time if she tries to say she won't come if her dog isn't welcome. Your nan is ridiculous", "Sounds fair enough.  You don't want pets that potentially don't get along to be in close proximity, it could lead to disasters down the line.\n\nNTA", "Dogs like to stick around humans and places food is cooking. The dog would only want to leave the assigned space because of the cat. NTA your request is more than reasonable.", "NTA\n\n\nWhen I had my dog and went over my sister's 4 cat house, he was either on his leash with me or contained in \"doggy jail,\" basically a large foldable playpen for dogs. It's what you do when you bring a dog to a cats house, especially if the cats human asks you to. \n\nMy sister currently still has 2 cats and a dog now, and they have a baby gate blocking a couple of rooms so the cats can have a safe space to get away from the dog when they want. \n\nPersonally, I'd tell her it's the gate or, unfortunately, the dog can't come. And if she doesn't come because of that, we'll that's her choice. You're not asking a lot, just for a bit of courtesy for the resident critter of your house.", "NTA- that is a totally reasonable and much safer plan.", "NTA, she\u2019s being ridiculous.\nI think your offer is already very generous and I don\u2019t understand why the dog should be allowed to go in every rooms of your house.", "NTA\n\nYou're compromising already, but she is unwilling to compromise at all.  That's not fair to you or your cat.  Her dog's past behavior isn't relevant to your cat.  Your cat might freak out seeing the dog.  Your cat lives there, too and shouldn't have to spend the day terrorized.  She's asking you to prioritize her dog over your cat.", "What's the problem? Is your nan coming to Christmas on her bicycle? This is a small and reasonable ask. NTA.", "NTA. You've suggested a perfectly reasonable solution that she's being super weird about. My guess is she no longer has the gate and is now turning this into a thing so she doesn't have to buy a new one.\n\nPersonally I'd just tell her that while you'd love to have her there you understand how important it is that pets are comfortable and if she won't be able to make it. Even if she agrees though I'd still be prepared to kick her out if she doesn't bring it on the day or buy one yourself just in case but leave it in the box so you can return it if not needed/ if she shows up without one and is like oh well nothing to be done now and then chucks a hissy fit when you bring it out.", "NAH. You don\u2019t have to let her dog roam but she gets to spend Christmas where she wants. She wants to spend it where her dog can roam.", "We have a very good dog that has never had an accident inside, may chew stuffed animals on the ground but nothing else, and if anything is scared of cats cause ours bullies him lol despite this, when we bring him anywhere (even without pets in the home) he\u2019s never allowed to roam outside of the area we\u2019re in. So if the dog will be corralled in the kitchen and living area where you\u2019ll spend all day that seems incredibly reasonable! And would be awesome for me cause I\u2019d never have to make sure my dog stays nearby!  When we got our cat, we did something similar to introduce them. Baby gate with kitten in the dining/kitchen and dog in LR and stairs to bedrooms. The cat could jump the gate so technically had free reign of the house but also a safe space to get away. \n\nI\u2019d just let it go and buy my own gate. You can get a cheap gate on Amazon or Facebook marketplace and phrase it as \u201cwe\u2019re blocking out cat from coming into the main area so everyone can enjoy the day\u201d", "NTA. Go buy your own gate, you can get them cheap, and have it set up and ready when Nan arrives. If she has issues at that point let whoever brought her take her home. By purchasing your own gate you can use it any time Nan comes over and if anyone else comes over who has a pet or a child, kids can be as nerve wracking to a pet especially if your cat isn't used to them.", "Dude. Just buy a baby gate for your house and set it up before she gets there. Dont make an old lady wedge a baby gate into her car and drag it to your place.\n\nEsh.

She stays where I can keep tabs on her. \n\nAlso, when friends come by with their dog, they don't even question their dog staying in the lounge only. \n\nThe nan is being totally unreasonable.", "Also dog owner here. NTA, stick to your guns. Dog will be fine with it for a day. Dog may well be fine with cats but there\u2019s no way you can tell the cat that", "Def NTA. When I take my dog to my parents place, he sometimes gets to go to the garage for a few minutes. Especially if we are eating or if we have certain company over.", "I feel they shouldn\u2019t have to buy a gate, especially since it will only be used (hypothetically) this one time. If a guest is bringing an animal, that means they bring the supplies for their animal. In this case, that includes a gate. Especially if Nan has it, she can bring it. \n\nI will agree though that she will probably \u201cforget it\u201d or mismanage it with her dog if she does decide to come for the holidays.", "If NextDoor (or Freecycle) is a thing where OP is, they could see if anyone had a spare kicking around or one she could borrow for a day.\n\nI just gave away a crate in a similar scenario.", "Absolutely this. Our dog is completely unbothered by our cat. Our cat, even after 10 months in our home, is uncomfortable around the dog. We keep a baby gate between the living room/dining room so that the cat can get away from the dog whenever she likes. Her toys, cat tower, food, water and liter box are all on the side of the gate the dog can\u2019t access. \nThe comfort of *both* animals must be considered.", "Well my dog loved cats and wanted to be their friend. She usually got \u201ctold\u201d by the cat, who wanted nothing to do with her, to back off which she did. She did manage to make one or two cat friends in her time though. Some dogs legitimately like cats.\n\nThat being said, if I was visiting someone\u2019s house, I kept my dog by my side and she did not have free reign to that persons house.\n\nNTA and stand firm on your boundary.", "My dog adores cats, came from a household with a couple of cats who were absolutely in charge. He tries to play with a cat we see on our walks but I won\u2019t let him. He might be great with cats, but the cat doesn\u2019t know that!", "As a dog owner, my dog absolutely hates cats", "Why did I just hear the music from The Wizard of Oz. \ud83d\ude02", "Why OP should \"invest\" in something that they only expect to use for this one visit when the dog's owner already has it and can easily transport it? OP is already being extremely accommodating by allowing the dog to visit. As for making things hard, in my experience, a baby gate is significantly easier to transport than a dog.", "If she has a dog that needs exercising and she can drive, putting a baby gate into the car isn't difficult. I could do it and I don't have a dog to walk and keep me fit. I'm in my 70s so not that young now.", "Nan is going to \u201cforget\u201d to bring the baby gate anyway even if she agrees beforehand.", "Agreed. If someone allowed me to bring my dog I\u2019d be over the moon with any safe option they provided and would probably ask if I could bring some treats or a toy over for their pet", "Use will be guaranteed this one time, but they will be prepared for any hypothetical future events. I would rather have one on hand, and consider it an investment in ensuring that I maintain control over my own home rather than trusting to anyone else's failing sense of responsibility, but to each their own.", "They can insist on keeping it leashed then", "Facebook marketplace can be good too.", "I agree that the onus is on Nan to be a responsible owner, but she's clearly not inclined to take up that mantle. OP should buy their own gate so then when Nan shows up for the holidays and says, \"Oh, gosh, I forgot the puppy gate, ha ha I am so silly!\" OP can smile and say, \"No worries, we have it covered.\"\n\nBecause you KNOW if someone raises this much of a stink about ensuring their own dog is a good guest, they are absolutely going to conveniently forget the agreement, should they decide to still attend.\n\nOP has the good fortune of being forewarned about Nan's entitlement. They have plenty of time to plan their counter-moves.\n\nOP: NTA.", "OP could even drive over to Nan's and pick up the gate and set it up before Nan arrives, like collect it a few days beforehand?", "My sisters dogs visit and we have a baby gate we put at the bottom of the stairs, the cats live upstairs when the dogs are out and roaming, occasionally they come downstairs but that\u2019s their choice and they have a safe place for themselves", "If she turns up without the gate then I think OP needs to tell her that she's sorry but nan will need to keep her dog on its lead during the visit.\n\n \"Remembering the gate would have made it so much better for you and your dog wouldn't it? So sorry but my cat isn't that good with dogs and this is her home. So I'm afraid you'll need to keep (dog's name) on the lead whilst you're here. No he can't have the run of the house. We did warn you.\"", "There absolutely are other possibilities, such as refusing Nan entry, but Nan will lay it on thick about being kicked out on a holiday. That's a level of guilt a lot of people aren't comfortable with shouldering. Nan is 100% going to rely on social pressure to be allowed in with her dog despite failing to bring the gate, and the leash topic she will present as another unreasonable request. It's obvious that Nan will not keep the dog on a leash, especially when they are all sitting down to eat. She will let it off for \"just a moment\" or \"only during dinner\" and that's it - all of OP's capacity for enforcement is gone. It's entirely possible that OP may have to jump up during dinner to chase the dog back to the living room, especially if Nan feels that \"the dog is on a leash, but I, Nan, don't need to be holding the other end of it.\"\n\nHaving a gate in reserve avoids the confrontation, takes the wind right out of Nan's sails, inducates that OP means to enforce what they said, prevents a big family fight, and shows Nan to be the whiny and entitled person she is. It sidesteps the problem instead of turning it into a no-win situation for OP."]}
