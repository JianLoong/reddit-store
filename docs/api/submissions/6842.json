For two reasons. \n\nFirst: You didn't mention the existence of any extenuating circumstances \u2013 *e.g.,* you have really long legs and simply cannot fit into the back seat without extreme discomfort (which would be much less of a problem when alone in the back seat anyway, since you could place your legs on the diagonal), or severe motion sickness which is exacerbated by riding in the back \u2013 so, since your future MIL is older than you are, you should have let her sit in front both ways. Even if you don't like her. \n\nSecond: While it is fine to get into a conversation that may not particularly interest all of the people in the car with you, it is unpardonably rude to engage in a conversation from which you specifically want to exclude someone who is riding in the same car with you. It is also ridiculously foolish to have that conversation when the person with whom you don't want to share it is just a couple of feet away in an enclosed space and can hear every word you say.

The seat isn\u2019t the real problem here, it\u2019s the lack of accountability and support from the fianc\u00e9 to protect his future wife from his moms abuse. Of course, if the mother was more kind, the OP wouldn\u2019t care if they sat in the front seat. The real implication of this argument is, are you still gonna let her walk all over me or are you going to choose me? Keep your standards high OP.

Well, we're safe and happy in each other's love!\" ... or something. Don't be whiny and petulant. Be gracious and calm. These are manners, and yours must be better than hers.

There is still time to decide whether or not she wants marry into this since its obvious that OP will be literally and metaphorically riding backseat to mama until MIL dies. \u270c\ud83c\udffe", "first of all \u201cbetrothed\u201d \ud83e\udd2e you\u2019re not some little princess. you\u2019re petty AF and if you can\u2019t communicate with your partner maturely you probably should put off the wedding until you can\n\nYTA", "**YTA**\n\nPrivate conversations aren't for car trips with future MIL in the car. She doesn't want you to marry him and she went to the front seat to cause problems. You're making it so easy for her. \n\nIf I were you I'd apologise to your fiance and take him out to that dinner. Talk to him then. Your MIL won't be in your presence for too long, but your Fiance will. Tolerate her, love him.", "YTA - you\u2019re acting like a bratty child. Grow up.", "ESH.\nThe only thing that's coming out of this is he has money and you want to be more important than MIL.\n\nIf it's horrible why are you there?", "Also mum sitting up front isn't nearly as bad as it sounds.  She's older, having her sit in the front gives her a bit more room for those old dodgy knees.  Yeah it's typical MIL stuff and she's being unfairly rude to you and she should drive herself if she has a car, but honestly, her being in front isn't as big of a problem as you make out, OP.", "Letting elders and guests sit up front is also the polite thing. \n\nThe alleged diatribe from momma sounds shitty but... consider OP and ask yourself if you think they are mature enough for your kid?", "Fully agree.  This is two women trying to control a man and peacocking to see which has the most control.  I feel sorry for your fianc\u00e9 OP - being stuck between two manipulative women.", "I'm not young, but my wife always sits in the front with me.  \nThat's just the way it goes. My mother and mother-in-law sit in the middle.   \nThen again, we have a minivan and the middle seats are just as spacious/comfortable as the front.   \nNot sure if I'd feel differently with a different kind of car.", "Idk it depends. My mother is a narcissistic manipulative woman whose used heaps of emotional and mental abuse on my my entire life. She\u2019s still in my life, but her butt can sit in the back if my husband is driving. Ngl OPs fianc\u00e9s mom sounds similar,\n\nMy grandmother or great aunts on the other hand? They can have the front.", "Bullshit. What happens if you take them\nBoth?? One rides on the roof??", "for real, anytime i\u2019ve been in the car with my parents and grandparents, grandparents always get the front seat", "The fact that they don\u2019t just say husband after saying they just got \u201cbetrothed\u201d made me stop reading. That\u2019s just unnecessary", "I have bad hips and always have to travel in the front so I can put the seat back a bit - the ergonomics of front and back can be quite different. Older people are more likely to have hip problems. I'm wondering if this is something OP hasn't mentioned, or didn't know, and it could all be a misunderstanding...\n\nStill gonna say ESH though.", "But...but...she's gotta throw that fit because she didn't get the front seat.  I mean seriously...\n\nI thought the same thing...that important conversation where they were going to talk in hoots and whistles must not have been that important.", "Maybe I missed it but OP says they wanted to have a conversation in the car that they could have with the fianc\u00e9 in front of the MIL due to the vague nature of the information needed. I don\u2019t see anything about the fianc\u00e9 saying they didn\u2019t want to have the conversation.", "Maybe he drives a limo with a privacy partition", "Wish granted :p", "It didn\u2019t say that, but my point was OP isn\u2019t the only one that gets to decide where and when a certain conversation happens. Also, if it\u2019s that vague that they can have the conversation in the front seat, why would it matter if they have the same conversation while she sits in the back?", "Her manipulation isn't a breaking point, it's her being toxic.", "This! So much purple prose, it makes the post come off fake.", "The way my eyes rolled when I read that lmao", "Yes \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 the minute I read that my mind was made up", "Your avatar is the stuff of nightmares.", "Agree with this 100%. Assholes can live a very long time. That doesn\u2019t mean they are worthy of respect. \n\nI don\u2019t know how people get engaged or married and don\u2019t realize that the person you go home to every evening is the person whose feelings they should consider most. Anyone who is more worried about upsetting their parents over their spouse has no business being married.", "Yeay!", "When riding with my boys & their partners, the partners always sit in the back and let me ride in front. Something I really, truly appreciate. There has never been a discussion about it, I NEVER call shotgun, it just happens.", "That is so weird in my culture. Where significant others sit together (unless  it is married/affianced couples who are friends out together, where the guys often sit together and the wives sit together). But Mom does not get to split her son and DIL up!", "This is what I was taught too. I was also taught the rule with friends my age that if you\u2019re in the passenger seat you gotta help the driver navigate if they need help so they don\u2019t check the GPS while driving. Third rule is if someone is more prone to carsickness they go up front. I am extremely lucky and rarely get carsick and I have trouble giving directions so I usually end up in the back when there are more than two of us and I\u2019m not the one driving. Like it\u2019s not hard. Unless you\u2019ve got a valid reason like you get carsick and being up front makes that better and the elder in question doesn\u2019t get carsick then sit in the back.", "Also because older people need the back support that the back seat does NOT have. Source: I'm an older person with back problems lol. YTA.", "Right?", "I was taught that as well, but elders shouldn\u2019t get respect just because of their age. Respect is earned, no matter what age you are.", "Exactly. When I visit my brother, my SIL insists I sit up front with him because I don't get to see him very often.\n\nAnd why not wait till you're alone to have a private conversation? So you can talk, you know, in private? Hell, have that private conversation at the dinner you bailed on. \n\nYTA, OP, and you sound very immature.", "It's not splitting the couple up. They just sit infront/behind each other in the same car and can still talk. It's not like MIL forced OP to ride in another car...", "Part of it is for practical reasons. My MIL gets car sick in the back and my mother has back problems, so she needs an easily adjustable seat. The other part is just that we feel it's respectful.", "When riding with my sisters, the front passenger helps with GPS, music, and temperature. They also pump gas in the winter. The driver pays and the passenger pumps the gas. I am the youngest, so sometimes I ride in the backseat of my own car just to not put in work, lol.", "As an easily carsick in the back seat person-*thank you* for letting me sit up front. :)", "That is so weird in my culture. Where significant others sit together (unless  it is married/affianced couples who are friends out together, where the guys often sit together and the wives sit together). But Mom does not get to split her son and DIL up!", "I always cede to the older person because of space. I can shove my creaky knees into the 2 inches of space in the back seat but my grandma can\u2019t fully bend her leg, therefore she gets front.", "I was taught the other way older generations get front seat as it can be more mobility friendly and more adjustable if they should need it. So I always offer up my front seat for his/my mum, grandma, dad etc.", "Us to. My grandpare.ts, paremts, and my in laws all automatically go to the backseat.  Both sides of my husband ans I respect our relationship", "That's pretty much how it operates with my husband's family. Even when i did have to sit up front with my father in law while his wife was in the back(she offered because i was 6 weeks pregnant and throwing up in the back) he kept asking when she'd come back and he did that on a different trip where she was soothing my niece on a road trip. But if my husband drives they tell me to sit up front with him. It's just how it goes in some families", "Please explain that to me because I truly do not understand that. I respect everyone until they give me reasons not to. You either show respect or you don't. Saying respect is earned, does that mean you are disrespectful until that person earns whatever level of respect you think you deserve? This is an honest question because I hear people say this a lot. I understand trust being earned, but not respect. You don't need to trust everyone, but you do need to respect them. Obviously until they give you reasons not to.", "My brother's easily carsick, especially with the way our dad drives LOL so like, I get it. Since he was old enough to sit up front when he's a passenger he's sat up front. When I drive too I insist that if our dad's with us that he sit in the back because he's less likely to get sick."]}
