He goes to their houses to do the same. In the past, I was invited lots of the time, along with other wives/girl friends. As we got older and kids came along, or for whatever reason, I'm not invited to participate. No other partners do, either. It's probably been about 5 or 6 years. I've known these people for more than 20 years, and I like them. I like games, too. But whatever, it's his friend group not mine. To be clear- I am explicitly not invited to join in. \n\nNow, when he hosts, I try to be out of the house doing other things. When I am home, I go to a different floor of the house and just hang out by myself. I say hi briefly when I see his friends, but I do not stick around or have longer conversations. \n\nHe asked why I am like this, with annoyance, after the last one. He says one guy's wife is in the kitchen with them and cooks for them most of the day (she likes doing that- it's not a weird gender role thing). Another sits with them and chats. He says it's awkward that I don't do that and very clearly avoid the house entirely if I can, and then that floor if I can't. \n\nFrom my perspective, informed by a lonely childhood- I have absolutely no interest in hanging out around the edges of a social thing I am not invited to. That seems so sad/pitiful/desperate. I kind of had enough of doing that sort of thing more than 30 years ago. I am not invited. How could I possibly tell if I am an annoyance or too much or affecting the dynamic from what they intended the dynamic to be by not having partners there? Further, it does hurt that I had been included and now I'm not. I really liked them and playing games. I guess that wasn't so much mutual. I am also kind of sad that I'm not in a marriage where 'couple friends' are a thing. We're friendly to each other's friends, but he- while entirely welcome- also isn't interested in hanging out with my friends. Maybe that's a rare situation for people? It's not what he wants, and he has a right to that. But I can be sad about it. He seems to think I am therefore pouting and taking it out on him. I think if I'm not included, it's crazy that there would be a problem with me absolutely not being there. \n\nSo tell me, am I being and awkward and rude asshole?", "created_utc": 1678299509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m3p9v/aita_for_avoiding_a_game_day_i_wasnt_invited_to/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're supposed to chat, be nice- put on a show. Even if he cooks, it wouldn't surprise me if you ended up being sort of a kitchen runner. The food is there, but you're fetching it and drinks.", "Why haven't you communicated how you feel with your husband", "Honestly, yeah.  I think he would see it as being a good host for his wife's guests.", "I get why it would seem that way. They're the core friend group here. It really is coincidental that they happen to all be men. It wasn't a 'couples' friend group, ever. We just were invited for some of it. And as schedules got harder and childcare became an issue, of course the non-core partners are the ones who stayed with kids. He certainly is the one who stays with ours when I have something to do. Those with kids are all very involved dads who do a fair share of childcare.", "I have a lot of theories here. \n\nI wonder first if OP and her husband are the only 2 in this group without kids.  If so, I kind of understand it a bit more. \n\nThe other guys get this \"guy time\" where there wives stay home with the kids.  Maybe the wives also have time where they go out with other moms or something.  So they aren't bringing their wives, and OP doesn't want to be the only guy with his wife there.  That is kind of understandable.  \n\nIt also sounds like the guys are friends, but the wives, while friendly with each other, aren't really friends themselves.  So maybe OP just isn't getting the social time she wants", "Why do you think I haven't? Most recently when he expressed  annoyance in the conversation I relayed above. He still thinks I'm being rude or in a snit, so I thought I should get another perspective.", "I would understand that, if you want to be a good host, one would be polite, or courteous, but to expect someone to be FRIENDLY after they made it very clear that they have no intention of being friends after 20 years would be out of the question for me. \n \nEdit: spelling", "You've known them for over 20 years, but you're still not considered \"core\" enough to be allowed to play a game that you used to play with them, even when it's being played in your own home? And your husband is upset that you won't just hang around? I understand that you don't want to see it through this lens, and that's your prerogative, but it sounds all kind of sexist to me.", "\u201cOf course\u201d the wives take care of the kids while the dads game for 8 hours straight?? Please stop saying this isn\u2019t a gender thing.", "Only about half of us have kids. That includes one with older teenagers who are mostly out of the house. We have a child. \n\nI do hang out with my friends, too. Husband is often invited, but almost always not interested. I'm also not thrilled with that. \n\nI'm not the one complaining about the situation. While I do have feelings, which aren't all related to the immediate situation (see: childhood trauma), I'm fine just staying away. He's got a problem with me staying away.", "Ha, I go to things where I am sometimes gone for a day or two, myself, or else head out right after work and don't come home until after midnight. I promise, it's not a situation where that is imbalanced. Childcare is equitably enjoyed and shared. We all really like our kids.", "I will trust you. \n\nYou are NTA in this case and your husband is out of line. THEY should be making you feel welcome, not specifically uninviting you to a game played at your own house. And if you aren\u2019t invited then WHY would they expect you to hang around like a fangirl?"]}
