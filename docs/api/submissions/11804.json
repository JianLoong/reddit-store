{"id": 11804, "submission_id": "11m3p9v", "title": "AITA for avoiding a game day I wasn't invited to?", "selftext": "My (F45) husband (M44) has a group of friends he occasionally has over for a day of board games- like an 8-10 hour stretch. He goes to their houses to do the same. In the past, I was invited lots of the time, along with other wives/girl friends. As we got older and kids came along, or for whatever reason, I'm not invited to participate. No other partners do, either. It's probably been about 5 or 6 years. I've known these people for more than 20 years, and I like them. I like games, too. But whatever, it's his friend group not mine. To be clear- I am explicitly not invited to join in. \n\nNow, when he hosts, I try to be out of the house doing other things. When I am home, I go to a different floor of the house and just hang out by myself. I say hi briefly when I see his friends, but I do not stick around or have longer conversations. \n\nHe asked why I am like this, with annoyance, after the last one. He says one guy's wife is in the kitchen with them and cooks for them most of the day (she likes doing that- it's not a weird gender role thing). Another sits with them and chats. He says it's awkward that I don't do that and very clearly avoid the house entirely if I can, and then that floor if I can't. \n\nFrom my perspective, informed by a lonely childhood- I have absolutely no interest in hanging out around the edges of a social thing I am not invited to. That seems so sad/pitiful/desperate. I kind of had enough of doing that sort of thing more than 30 years ago. I am not invited. How could I possibly tell if I am an annoyance or too much or affecting the dynamic from what they intended the dynamic to be by not having partners there? Further, it does hurt that I had been included and now I'm not. I really liked them and playing games. I guess that wasn't so much mutual. I am also kind of sad that I'm not in a marriage where 'couple friends' are a thing. We're friendly to each other's friends, but he- while entirely welcome- also isn't interested in hanging out with my friends. Maybe that's a rare situation for people? It's not what he wants, and he has a right to that. But I can be sad about it. He seems to think I am therefore pouting and taking it out on him. I think if I'm not included, it's crazy that there would be a problem with me absolutely not being there. \n\nSo tell me, am I being and awkward and rude asshole?", "created_utc": 1678299509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m3p9v/aita_for_avoiding_a_game_day_i_wasnt_invited_to/", "score": 506, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(Not to degrade the others if they genuinely enjoy just watching but that should not be the expectation.)", "OP has known her husbands friends for about 20 years. For the first 15 years (approximately) they participated in group activities where they more than likely bonded and got to know each other quite well. Cut to 5-6 years ago and all of a sudden \u201cOP can\u2019t come.\u201d \u201cWe still want to come over and play at your house, and would love it if she baked for us and kept us company, but she can\u2019t play.\u201d How fucking hurtful is that? That the time they spent together meant NOTHING. That\u2019s like saying \u201cI think you\u2019re an okay person, but I don\u2019t like (or respect you) well enough to keep including you in our get togethers.\u201d The opinion of an internet stranger means nothing, but being excluded would hurt me and make me feel like I did something wrong. And before you say \u201cit\u2019s not just OP, it\u2019s ALL the women.\u201d That just goes to show how little these men think of their partners.", "Because you didn\u2019t read the post properly.", "Because OP has accepted they aren\u2019t invited. So why are some people focusing on that is weird. The issue at hand is \u201cOP isn\u2019t invited, but husband is mad they don\u2019t hang around and be a server\u201d", "Yeah, that\u2019s not cool. You deserved better than to be arm candy if that wasn\u2019t the role you wanted.", "Yeah, I'm still struggling to understand why this is important to the husband. Some people really care about presenting a \"harmonious\" functioning marriage to his others (not saying that it's not, but emphasizing on showing it off). I wonder if those friends have made comments. Does he need her to be on his side during discussions? Does he need validation? Does he need to show his friends that is in charge or desirable?\n\nNTA, but I would try to get to the bottom of this. \"It's awkward\" is not good enough", "> That just goes to show how little these men think of their partners.\n\nI just don't see it that way.  Wanting an occasional guys night where they get together in person and hang out together doesn't mean they think little of their partners.  I also know plenty of women who do girls nights once a month.  Doesn't mean they don't like their husbands.", "Then why is he winning that she's not there then? \nShe's not invited so she f's right off and he's upset about it.", "The issue is it used to be for everyone but now suddenly in recent years it's only for the guys. A guys night is vastly different from turning what used to be an all inclusive game night into \"sorry you are no longer invited to play with us now.\" If it had started as a guys night thing there would be no issue since op wasn't invited from the statt but 15 years of op and the wives being included and only recently excluding them?"]}
