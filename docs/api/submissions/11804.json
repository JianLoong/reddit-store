{"id": 11804, "submission_id": "11m3p9v", "title": "AITA for avoiding a game day I wasn't invited to?", "selftext": "My (F45) husband (M44) has a group of friends he occasionally has over for a day of board games- like an 8-10 hour stretch. He goes to their houses to do the same. In the past, I was invited lots of the time, along with other wives/girl friends. As we got older and kids came along, or for whatever reason, I'm not invited to participate. No other partners do, either. It's probably been about 5 or 6 years. I've known these people for more than 20 years, and I like them. I like games, too. But whatever, it's his friend group not mine. To be clear- I am explicitly not invited to join in. \n\nNow, when he hosts, I try to be out of the house doing other things. When I am home, I go to a different floor of the house and just hang out by myself. I say hi briefly when I see his friends, but I do not stick around or have longer conversations. \n\nHe asked why I am like this, with annoyance, after the last one. He says one guy's wife is in the kitchen with them and cooks for them most of the day (she likes doing that- it's not a weird gender role thing). Another sits with them and chats. He says it's awkward that I don't do that and very clearly avoid the house entirely if I can, and then that floor if I can't. \n\nFrom my perspective, informed by a lonely childhood- I have absolutely no interest in hanging out around the edges of a social thing I am not invited to. That seems so sad/pitiful/desperate. I kind of had enough of doing that sort of thing more than 30 years ago. I am not invited. How could I possibly tell if I am an annoyance or too much or affecting the dynamic from what they intended the dynamic to be by not having partners there? Further, it does hurt that I had been included and now I'm not. I really liked them and playing games. I guess that wasn't so much mutual. I am also kind of sad that I'm not in a marriage where 'couple friends' are a thing. We're friendly to each other's friends, but he- while entirely welcome- also isn't interested in hanging out with my friends. Maybe that's a rare situation for people? It's not what he wants, and he has a right to that. But I can be sad about it. He seems to think I am therefore pouting and taking it out on him. I think if I'm not included, it's crazy that there would be a problem with me absolutely not being there. \n\nSo tell me, am I being and awkward and rude asshole?\n\nEdit: to clarify a few questions. Yes, this has been communicated. Read the last two paragraphs like a conversation, with these words and details exchanged, because it was. \n\nSecondly, why I'm not included is irrelevant. It's completely acceptable to want to hang out with your friends by yourself, even in a marriage. The change happened mainly due to ease of playing with a smaller crowd. It sucks for me, but no one is being explicitly mean to me by not including me.\n\nThird, I have stuff I'm happy to do on my own. I have my own friends. And while I get the nice intentions, I have no interest in making a friend group with the sole shared commonality of \"our husbands are friends!\" Or \"excluded spouse spite game day\". That seems extra soul-killing and sad to me for some reason.", "created_utc": 1678299509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m3p9v/aita_for_avoiding_a_game_day_i_wasnt_invited_to/", "score": 3159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On the flip side,  I can see how the game day got too big with all the spouses,  (games suitable for 4 or 5 players do not always expand easily to 8 or 10 played), so the core group decided to pull it back in.

You deserved better than to be arm candy if that wasn\u2019t the role you wanted.", "Yeah, I'm still struggling to understand why this is important to the husband. Some people really care about presenting a \"harmonious\" functioning marriage to his others (not saying that it's not, but emphasizing on showing it off). I wonder if those friends have made comments. Does he need her to be on his side during discussions? Does he need validation?

My wife has a book club. I stop by say hi to everyone and go do my own thing. That is hers for her and her friends.   I have a poker night. When I host she hangs around  too long.

In this case, it sounds like they had a tradition of playing games when they were single, then  partners got involved in the games too, but as time went on - kids were born, people's lives got busier, etc. - that the partners drifted away from this activity and it's just the original friend group again.  It is nice to have time \"just the guys\" or \"just the girls\", and it sounds like that's what this has evolved back to such that partners are no longer invited.    \n\nI also think that it is totally reasonable for you to feel sad about no longer being able to participate in something you liked doing.  And based on what you said about having a lonely childhood, being uninvited probably hits you harder than it would someone who didn't have that history.  I also think it is totally reasonable for you to plan something else away from home or to find something else to do in another part of the house.\n\nThe issue really is how you both are handling this.  Your feelings are hurt and I am sure it shows.  Your quick hello probably does feel awkward because I'm sure everybody can feel your hurt and disappointment, but may not realize that it what it is - they may just feel negative, unwelcoming vibes.  And by avoiding them otherwise, it probably feels to the friends like you are hiding out until they leave.  I don't think you'd have to hang out a lot or do a bunch of hosting duties to make them feel welcome - maybe a little more chitchat and then a \"alright, I'll leave you to it, I'm off to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" kiss your husband, and make your exit. \n\nYour husband, rather than talking to you about what is going on or just leaving you be, gets annoyed and attributes your hurt feelings to pouting - which implies bratiness and maliciousness rather than plain old honest emotion.  He's taking your sadness personally - probably because he feels some level of guilt because he knows your feelings are hurt, but doesn't want to own that - so instead he talks about what the other partners do that you aren't - cooking, chatting, whatever.", "NTA, you are uninvited yet they want you to talk to them and make them food.

OP, it's so rude of them not to invite you, especially when you used to be included. I'd do exactly the same as you. I have no interest in sitting around listening to/watching other people enjoy something that I'm actively excluded from. It makes me miserable. Your husband's reaction to this makes him solidly the AH in this situation.\n\nAlso, adding in the fact that your husband doesn't want to spend time with your friends... it's not painting him in the best light as a person generally.\n\nPerhaps you could find your own group (either in person or online) to play games with, and make sure not to invite the husband.

If a shared friend calls him and not me and says \"Oh drop by later\"...it's both of us. Even if that friend never spoke to me directly. We will drop by. It'd be commented on if I didn't.

Further, it does hurt that I had been included and now I'm not. I really liked them and playing games. I guess that wasn't so much mutual. I am also kind of sad that I'm not in a marriage where 'couple friends' are a thing. We're friendly to each other's friends, but he- while entirely welcome- also isn't interested in hanging out with my friends. Maybe that's a rare situation for people? It's not what he wants, and he has a right to that. But I can be sad about it. He seems to think I am therefore pouting and taking it out on him.

Are you like this all the time?", "Ok wait a minute, I'm a little bit confused now, sorry to beat a dead horse, but what you said here and in the post can be taken two ways. Is it said, in exact words \"OP, you are not invited to play, and we do not want you at other houses, but while you are here, please sit with us?\" Or are you saying that they have just not extended an invitation specifically saying \"OP, we want you to play with us\" and you're taking that as you aren't welcome? Because if it's the former, N T A, that's extremely rude of them, especially after so long. If it's the latter however, Y T A, because with normal relationships after 20 years, it's very possible they just assume they don't HAVE to. I have the exact same situation. Me and my friends have a weekly game night. Board games, video games, DnD, whichever we feel that week, roughly 8 hours a time. Started with just guys (it was a coworker thing and we just happened to be all men) and then grew to other friends and partners. I have never EXPLICITLY invited my best friend's wife. She knows I love her and is always welcome in my home. She first attended as his gf when he and I lived together, and he invited her. Later when they got married and moved in together, she comes because they're a package deal. If I ever invite him somewhere, it's assumed she will be there too. She chooses when she wants to come (some weeks she has plans and doesnt) but it's always up to her and no hard feelings on either side. Sometimes she comes and doesn't like what we play (the board games specifically) so she watches my TV and chats with us while we play. Now I feel for you, because with 99% of events, I will not attend if the host does not specifically invite me personally. I don't like tagging along or crashing things, I feel awkward. But this event we have is a recurring weekly thing for years so it bypasses. Normally I'm on your side but because you described almost exactly what happens at my place, I'm getting curious for clarification. Because if I was in this group, after 20 years, I would not be inviting you either, I'd assume you knew you were welcome, and I'd definitely notice and assume I did something to offend you if I saw you were going out of your way to avoid me.\n\nIn addition, I'm wondering the thoughts of the other spouses. As other comments suggested, maybe after kids were born or others dropped out, they just assumed the women didn't want to play? Or maybe they thought your husband was the one not inviting you or you spoke to him saying you didn't want to come, and they weren't gonna intrude? Idk", "This is so weird to me.

And he should let you have your solo me time on those nights\n\n\nNTA\n\n\nAlso want to add from your reasoning of the other partners acting differently.  They are comfortable doing their own thing while their partner has a game night. Their own things happens to be cooking or socializing. Yours happens to be spending time elsewhere.", "NTA if he wanted you to be around, then he shouldn\u2019t have uninvited you!\n\nI would feel super awkward as well, I don\u2019t want to lurk around something I used to have fun at but was essentially informed I was unwelcome? \n\nI\u2019m too introverted to use my brain juice hosting an event I\u2019m not invited to.", "NTA - If he wants you to join them, he should invite you to join them.", "NTA. Sounds like he wants you around for pleasant background noise/interaction. Which is ungenerous. I think you're perfectly reasonable to say that you're very happy to take part in the games, but not happy to be a NPC at these parties.", "NTA but I feel like your edits contradict what you originally post.", "Yeah I get this and I get your last paragraph. For me it\u2019s hard to be close friends with most of the wives/girlfriends of my SO\u2019s friends because they\u2019re simply \u201cfriends of circumstance\u201d and it\u2019s for some reason hard to find threads of commonality to really get to a level of \u201cfriendship\u201d that\u2019s not just superficial.", "Nta. This is really sad from a couple who love playing board games! He wants you to be the doting wife while he sits around for 5h. That's so f up", "NTA. Sounds like a friends exclusive invite only kinda thing. Why would you want to just watch them play when you could be upstairs at least enjoying some alone time? His expectation doesn\u2019t make sense. And the fact that he does not have interest in spending time with your friends makes your response even more valid.", "Info - are these the types of games where you could participate only on the days you guys host? Or are they role playing campaign-type games where you would need to be present every meetup?\nIt seems like a nice compromise if you can play with them every now and then, but not all games are like that. I think you\u2019re NTA. It seems rude to be hanging around an event you\u2019re explicitly not invited to.", "INFO: Is he asking you to make an effort to be social with them / be part of the gathering (as some folks are assuming re: cooking for them etc), or is he asking you to just be more relaxed about the gathering and act normally in your own home?\n\nYou say a lot that it's okay for him to do things with his friends without you, but it seems like you might not actually be emotionally ok with that. And if he feels like he's driving you out of your own home every time he has his friends over, of course that's an awful feeling. \n\nThat's not the same as if he's objecting to you making your own plans on those days, though - if you make other plans on those days, great, more power to you! That's probably what I would do. But I think those two scenarios have very different emotional content.", "If you aren't allowed to participate, then he really only wants you there as an accessory.  Not as a person in your own right.", "Lol", "OP used to be included. She has been uninvited", "I don't understand why you're still excluded when YOUR HOUSE is hosting.", "[removed]", "A distinction without a difference. The sexists who have themselves convinced they are not are kind of the worst.", "It's weird that you're excluded from games at your own house. It's one thing to exclude the other household's wives/girlfriends but in your OWN HOME you should be welcome to partake. And if not, you're perfectly justified in pretending they don't exist and doing your own thing.", "It's a guilt thing. He is sensitive to your absence because it makes him feel guilty about doing stuff in your house that doesn't include you. He wants you to be visibly Fine With This, and instead of either 1. Changing the situation so you ARE fine with it or 2. Coming to terms with the fact you'd rather be elsewhere in the house, he's decided to complain and attempt to make you pretend to be fine with it.\n\nDude needs to either have these events elsewhere, find a way for you to participate, or just harden up and stop being so sensitive to the fact that a thing he's doing has a mild negative effect on you and you are allowed to cope with said negative effect in any peaceful way you see fit. It is unreasonable to demand you to pretend to be fine.\n\nIt's like seeing someone's sad and thinking telling them to smile will solve the problem, then getting mad when it doesn't. Shit doesn't work that way.", "Sorry, I should have said \u201cre-included\u201d. If it\u2019s just one extra person, it shouldn\u2019t mess with the game numbers / participants too much.", "Yes, but...would he be a caterer for a group of you and your female friends where he was not part of the fun? Ask him. It's hard to even imagine.", "He wants you to \u2728entertain\u2728 them for 8-10 hours like a 1950s house wife.  \n\nWhy should you sit around NOT enjoying yourself and just watching them play games and serving them hors d\u2019oeuvres and cocktails.\n\nThe nerve!!!! NTA", "I was good friends with the best host for gaming parties there ever was (may he rest in peace). He did all the cooking himself and the #1 rule was the only person who could be made not to participate was himself. He maintained a large group of friends who have tried to hold the group together, and continue holding parties the same nights he would. It\u2019s vitally important to make sure everyone is included.", "I mean, yeah, that\u2019s exactly what this is. Dumbass teenage behavior.", "Reminds me of when my Persian BF would hangout with his friends and speak Farsi all the time. I was left out of the conversation but when I left to go read on the couch I was \u201crude for ignoring company\u201d."]}
