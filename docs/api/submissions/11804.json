He goes to their houses to do the same. In the past, I was invited lots of the time, along with other wives/girl friends. As we got older and kids came along, or for whatever reason, I'm not invited to participate. No other partners do, either. It's probably been about 5 or 6 years. I've known these people for more than 20 years, and I like them. I like games, too. But whatever, it's his friend group not mine. To be clear- I am explicitly not invited to join in. \n\nNow, when he hosts, I try to be out of the house doing other things. When I am home, I go to a different floor of the house and just hang out by myself. I say hi briefly when I see his friends, but I do not stick around or have longer conversations. \n\nHe asked why I am like this, with annoyance, after the last one. He says one guy's wife is in the kitchen with them and cooks for them most of the day (she likes doing that- it's not a weird gender role thing). Another sits with them and chats. He says it's awkward that I don't do that and very clearly avoid the house entirely if I can, and then that floor if I can't. \n\nFrom my perspective, informed by a lonely childhood- I have absolutely no interest in hanging out around the edges of a social thing I am not invited to. That seems so sad/pitiful/desperate. I kind of had enough of doing that sort of thing more than 30 years ago. I am not invited. How could I possibly tell if I am an annoyance or too much or affecting the dynamic from what they intended the dynamic to be by not having partners there? Further, it does hurt that I had been included and now I'm not. I really liked them and playing games. I guess that wasn't so much mutual. I am also kind of sad that I'm not in a marriage where 'couple friends' are a thing. We're friendly to each other's friends, but he- while entirely welcome- also isn't interested in hanging out with my friends. Maybe that's a rare situation for people? It's not what he wants, and he has a right to that. But I can be sad about it. He seems to think I am therefore pouting and taking it out on him. I think if I'm not included, it's crazy that there would be a problem with me absolutely not being there. \n\nSo tell me, am I being and awkward and rude asshole?", "created_utc": 1678299509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11m3p9v/aita_for_avoiding_a_game_day_i_wasnt_invited_to/", "score": 1112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You deserved better than to be arm candy if that wasn\u2019t the role you wanted.", "Yeah, I'm still struggling to understand why this is important to the husband.

I wonder if those friends have made comments. Does he need her to be on his side during discussions? Does he need validation? Does he need to show his friends that is in charge or desirable?\n\nNTA, but I would try to get to the bottom of this. \"It's awkward\" is not good enough", "> That just goes to show how little these men think of their partners.\n\nI just don't see it that way.

My wife has a book club. I stop by say hi to everyone and go do my own thing. That is hers for her and her friends.   I have a poker night. When I host she hangs around  too long.

In this case, it sounds like they had a tradition of playing games when they were single, then  partners got involved in the games too, but as time went on - kids were born, people's lives got busier, etc. - that the partners drifted away from this activity and it's just the original friend group again.  It is nice to have time \"just the guys\" or \"just the girls\", and it sounds like that's what this has evolved back to such that partners are no longer invited.    \n\nI also think that it is totally reasonable for you to feel sad about no longer being able to participate in something you liked doing.  And based on what you said about having a lonely childhood, being uninvited probably hits you harder than it would someone who didn't have that history.  I also think it is totally reasonable for you to plan something else away from home or to find something else to do in another part of the house.\n\nThe issue really is how you both are handling this.  Your feelings are hurt and I am sure it shows.  Your quick hello probably does feel awkward because I'm sure everybody can feel your hurt and disappointment, but may not realize that it what it is - they may just feel negative, unwelcoming vibes.  And by avoiding them otherwise, it probably feels to the friends like you are hiding out until they leave.  I don't think you'd have to hang out a lot or do a bunch of hosting duties to make them feel welcome - maybe a little more chitchat and then a \"alright, I'll leave you to it, I'm off to \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_.\" kiss your husband, and make your exit. \n\nYour husband, rather than talking to you about what is going on or just leaving you be, gets annoyed and attributes your hurt feelings to pouting - which implies bratiness and maliciousness rather than plain old honest emotion.  He's taking your sadness personally - probably because he feels some level of guilt because he knows your feelings are hurt, but doesn't want to own that - so instead he talks about what the other partners do that you aren't - cooking, chatting, whatever.", "NTA, you are uninvited yet they want you to talk to them and make them food.

If a shared friend calls him and not me and says \"Oh drop by later\"...it's both of us. Even if that friend never spoke to me directly. We will drop by. It'd be commented on if I didn't.

If there's a party going on there, you share it?\n\nIt just seems weird to me that OP was invited, then kinda got busy with kid stuff (legit reason) but after 20 years wouldn't just slide back right in if the crowd or activity hadn't changed?

Further, it does hurt that I had been included and now I'm not. I really liked them and playing games. I guess that wasn't so much mutual. I am also kind of sad that I'm not in a marriage where 'couple friends' are a thing. We're friendly to each other's friends, but he- while entirely welcome- also isn't interested in hanging out with my friends. Maybe that's a rare situation for people? It's not what he wants, and he has a right to that. But I can be sad about it. He seems to think I am therefore pouting and taking it out on him.

If the other wives enjoy that, that's fine for them, but you've expressed that you don't and your explanations are perfectly reasonable.\n\nIt's like cooking a big fancy meal for a crowd and being upset you're not thrilled to sit at the table and watch everyone else eat. \n\nIt's honestly bizarre that he doesn't see how rude he's being. I'd go so far to say it's kinda cruel. I doubt he's *trying* to rub your exclusion in your face but that's effectively what's happening.\n\nIs he generally able to empathize with you in other situations? Is this just a blind spot he has when this particular friend group is involved, or does he have trouble understanding where you're coming from on a regular basis?", "Have you not asked him why you can\u2019t join in the games?? How does he justify himself??", ">  I found not being invited perfectly reasonable if sad for me\n\nHow exactly is it reasonable to not be invited? Has he given an explanation for why? That's honestly strange.", "*Get your girlfriends together and go bar hopping or go see the male strippers at a club*.\n\n.....and get roaring drunk, or pretend to be.\n\nDo y'all live in Stepford, Connecticut, OP?\n\nNTA", "Yikes. Are you like this all the time?", "Ok wait a minute, I'm a little bit confused now, sorry to beat a dead horse, but what you said here and in the post can be taken two ways. Is it said, in exact words \"OP, you are not invited to play, and we do not want you at other houses, but while you are here, please sit with us?\" Or are you saying that they have just not extended an invitation specifically saying \"OP, we want you to play with us\" and you're taking that as you aren't welcome? Because if it's the former, N T A, that's extremely rude of them, especially after so long. If it's the latter however, Y T A, because with normal relationships after 20 years, it's very possible they just assume they don't HAVE to. I have the exact same situation. Me and my friends have a weekly game night. Board games, video games, DnD, whichever we feel that week, roughly 8 hours a time. Started with just guys (it was a coworker thing and we just happened to be all men) and then grew to other friends and partners. I have never EXPLICITLY invited my best friend's wife. She knows I love her and is always welcome in my home. She first attended as his gf when he and I lived together, and he invited her. Later when they got married and moved in together, she comes because they're a package deal. If I ever invite him somewhere, it's assumed she will be there too. She chooses when she wants to come (some weeks she has plans and doesnt) but it's always up to her and no hard feelings on either side. Sometimes she comes and doesn't like what we play (the board games specifically) so she watches my TV and chats with us while we play. Now I feel for you, because with 99% of events, I will not attend if the host does not specifically invite me personally. I don't like tagging along or crashing things, I feel awkward. But this event we have is a recurring weekly thing for years so it bypasses. Normally I'm on your side but because you described almost exactly what happens at my place, I'm getting curious for clarification. Because if I was in this group, after 20 years, I would not be inviting you either, I'd assume you knew you were welcome, and I'd definitely notice and assume I did something to offend you if I saw you were going out of your way to avoid me.\n\nIn addition, I'm wondering the thoughts of the other spouses. As other comments suggested, maybe after kids were born or others dropped out, they just assumed the women didn't want to play? Or maybe they thought your husband was the one not inviting you or you spoke to him saying you didn't want to come, and they weren't gonna intrude? Idk", "This is so weird to me. I don't understand why it was ok before that you were there and why it changed. Tbh I'd do the same thing as you do. Maybe start women only board game days with the other wives on the same day. Also NTA", "Yeah, the COVID (over)reaction did a **lot** of damage to socialization.  My entire friend group just kind of ended because of it.  We tried to keep it going with online games but really what we enjoyed more than the table games we used to do was the hanging out and socializing in person.", "Wow! They actually said you aren\u2019t invited and your husband didn\u2019t stand up for you?!? Fuuuuuckkkkk I\u2019d be ripping. He\u2019s lucky you even let them in your house", "Who said, \"You're not invited\"? Was it your husband?\n\nBecause if it was someone else, NEWS FLASH. You don't have to be invited to play games in your own home. If they don't want you to play, they can play somewhere else.\n\nIf it was your husband, you have even more serious problems.", "Same. Like. Exactly the same. It\u2019s so uncomfortable.", "I'm also on the spectrum.  \n\nI'm very sensitive to rejection or exclusion.  And if I have the least bit of a suspicion that I'm not wanted somewhere, I leave immediately.  \n\nCertainly if someone outright **tells** me, the very last thing that occurs to me is to stay around.  \"You're not invited here, but stay anyways.\"", "I would recommend telling him exactly what you said in the final paragraph of the post. He will no longer be able to claim that you never said anything and you\u2019ll know whether he respects your needs. You aren\u2019t a prop or a maid. You have every right to want to be included. Maybe he never thought about it, maybe he wants to ignore it. But it\u2019s time to address the elephant. You deserve to feel wanted. NTA", "Curious if you actually told him what you wrote here? \n\nI mean, I\u2019d just come out and say \u201cyou don\u2019t invite me to these gatherings, and I feel like an intruder since you\u2019ve all made it abundantly clear I am not welcome to participate. I also have no interest in catering to everyone, especially since I know that is your thing. So, I\u2019d just be sitting around hoping people engage in conversation while you are playing games. Sorry that you find it awkward, but I\u2019m either included or not. As of the past \u201chowever many\u201d years, it\u2019s clear I am not.\u201d\n\nETA: NTA", "Okay, but it definitely does sound like a gender thing - he wants you to play the 1950s wife and host and make everyone comfortable without being a part of the actual fun.", "Strahd is not what I\u2019d recommend to brand new players. There are loads of cheap and pay what you want one-shots on DMs Guild.\n\nI\u2019ve ran [House of the Midnight Violet](https://www.dmsguild.com/m/product/184744) multiple times\u2014 it\u2019s my go-to trial run for new groups, and what I ran my very first time as a DM.", "See, that's how I feel. I am also not especially interested in firming up a friend group with the common identity of \"husband's friends' wives\", or \"spite at not being included\". I do have my own friends, including men, and also sometimes including a trivia night at a bar!", "Yep, this is 100% my read as well. Husband wants to have his boy's club game night but not feel like a dick for explicitly excluding his wife.", "She's explained it in other comments - all of the spouses (wives) have been disinvited for the sin of being spouses.", "Can you see out your peripheral really well too? Like I can spot an eye roll a mile away while looking downward lol. It's my cue to shut the fuck up already along with body posture.", "Did you read the post at all?", "As a woman with kids, I dont find that explanation understandable. I do not understand why some other woman should be excluded from group activity and can not participate due to kids or I do not have interest in participating. Especially not someone who did used to participate before.", "eh she doesn't directly say that she spoke to him and specifically asked him why and he told her so i thought there was a little wiggle room there for communication\n\nbut going off her comments, if we go with that he wants 'his' time and the partners aren't invited and blah blah blah then yeah it's obvious he just wants her around to save face or something like that and it's kinda immature to be upset with her for doing the completely normal thing of.. doing her own thing. NTA", "Not really, I\u2019ve got deep set eyes lol but it\u2019s mostly cues I pick up on subconsciously. I couldn\u2019t even say what\u2019s tipping me off, just that something is.", ">Most married people I know consider themselves a host if there are guests in their home\n\nMost married people wouldn't invite people over for a game night while expressly exclude their partner from playing.", "Oh that's fair. There are a ton of different signals, it feels very abstract to describe.", "Who is watching your child during these game days?", "I think the thing is, it may not be a \"game night\", but it could be any number of things that the other partner isn't included in.  One of my female friends hosts a book club for her female friends.   The husband isn't invited.  One friend hosts a bachelor night.  Again, husband not invited.", "Which is confusing, because the problem with her husband is him not understanding or responding to her needs. If she hasn't explained her feelings to him, or only told him part of it, wouldn't the best first step be to more comprehensively share her feelings?", "Could you please point out the part you think I didn\u2019t read?", "Okay, and do the husband's in those situations sit around and entertain all the guests while being expressly forbidden from participating in the activity?", "Or the guy is just a jerk and doesn't care that she's expressed her concerns. Which seems to be the situation.", "It\u2019s not the situation explicitly outlined in the OP. She doesn\u2019t say what was actually said to her partner. Somebody *asks* if she\u2019s told her partner how she feels and is met with hostility. He might be a jerk, but you really wanna just jump to that conclusion? \n\nI really don\u2019t understand the downvotes when everything being mentioned is respectful and civil. Nobody\u2019s discounting OP\u2019s experience or saying she doesn\u2019t have a right to her feelings, they just asked if she had actually told her partner!"]}
