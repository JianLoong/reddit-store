She wanted a white white room(she told me that) and we have to pay the paint. I told her, if you want a white white room, bring your own pintor and she said that\u2019s ok, I prefer that. Also she wanted to bring and arquitect\u2026 if the place is safe. The day she came, I repeat everything (the management, paint, etc), but my mom appears and say: I will paint it, don\u2019t worry. So, she started an imaginary war against me because I said other things\u2026 THINGS! She changed everything because my mom said that and fought with me because she can\u2019t deal with two sides. I said. There\u2019s no two sides, there\u2019s one and it\u2019s mine. So, she didn\u2019t like to say no and started to talk with mom, saying a bunch of s** of me and that\u2019s why she will deal with her. My mom is naive and for money, she doesn\u2019t want to lose her, but she already hates her. She doesn\u2019t talk to me at all, she complains imaginary things (like I forbidden use the hair drier\u2026 I don\u2019t talk to her, also she said to us, she doesn\u2019t use it at all), use the laundry, when I was using(she took my clothes that was inside the washing machine) and use the drier machine (that\u2019s forbidden, words of my mom because it\u2019s expensive to use it. Me and mom can be allowed). She said it was allowed and none of us said that\n.\nShe use her own stuff and if we touch it, she makes a big deal of it\u2026 We only use our stuffs. We can\u2019t touch her door knob and use wipe towels to enter to her own room. I touch it because she was full with her hand, and politely I offered to open her door. She almost eat me.\nWe can\u2019t kick her because she has to leave by her own. If we kick her immediately, we have to return her deposit and my mom doesn\u2019t have it.\nI know she\u2019s sick(the lawyer) because she said some Colombians attack her and I think they hit her head and had some problems. But, she stills works as a lawyer, and repeat that in every phrase. She use the card \u201cI\u2019ve attacked \u201c Every time like she was a poor girl and nothing else. I have no sympathy since she treated me like s***, also is not an excuse.", "I tried to evict her, but my mom decides it and she doesn\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t know why. Why are confused??", "I\u2019m confused because this was hard to read. \n\nYour mom is incompetent. You need to do whatever you have to do in your jurisdiction to get decision making authority over her. This doesn\u2019t need or be her decision anymore.", "Im sorry if it\u2019s hard to read. It\u2019s kinda complex and also, in 3000 letters I had to cut some paragraphs", "By law, she\u2019s still competent. By her eyes and my family eyes, she still can make decisions, but no one lives with her. No one. She\u2019s so stubborn that even the doctors doesn\u2019t know about her behavior. She forgets it and doesn\u2019t recognize she\u2019s worse than she think. They need a big and huge proof to make something, but it is in the details I see she getting worse. She goes to 3 different doctors (neuro, cardio and Parkinson\u2019s specialist)"]}
