Imagine trying to deal with difficult real life issues with someone who behaves like this. Big red flag. NTA", "You are not the asshole! Since you've asked in the past what you can change and she still complains. She just sounds like a picky eater, which is fine when you're a child...but as an adult you have to get over that.", "NTA and also how long has this been going on? Did she like your food before but now she doesn't? She should def make her own food if she hates everything you cook. My partner doesn't cook but when he tries, let's say pancakes, I'll eat them even if they're raw in the middle. It's just so nice to have someone cook for you.", "Seems like she doesn't know how to handle frustation, which is a fundamental skill every functioning adult should have.", "NTA. Your GF sounds a little controlling and didn't like it when you stood up for yourself.", "NTA, if someone wants something to change but cannot or will not express how said thing should change....then they lose the right to complain about said thing. Also, crying and ignoring you because you expressed your feelings is manipulation on her part even if she doesn't realize it. She's trying to get away with making you feel bad for your reaction to her behaviour by upping the emotional reaction on her end in an attempt to make you feel guilty. Then even though you were the one originally hurt/upset/however you want to phrase it, it ends up becoming about her and her emotions with you soothing her and trying to get her to stop ignoring you rather than the other way around. Again, this may be a learned behaviour and not necessarily malicious but it is probably the most common form of manipulation I see in relationships and it will inevitably lead to serious resentment on your part if this is how she continues to react to any negative emotions expressed by you.", "NTA, she can absolutely cook her own food, it is not your responsibility to bend over backwards to her whims.", "You really need to ask yourself if the relationship is worth it. I suspect it won\u2019t get better.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou're trying to compromise by cooking, a chore she doesn't like, then criticizes what you prepare?   \n\n\nI wouldn't cook either.", "NTA. You are doing something nice for her and she is being ungrateful and rude. She has no right to complain about your cooking if she doesn't want to do it herself. You are not her personal chef, you are her partner. She should appreciate your efforts and give you constructive feedback, not just criticism. If she doesn't like your food, she can either cook for herself or order takeout. You don't have to put up with her disrespect.", "The crying is just to manipulate you.  Criticism of your food is to manipulate you. See a pattern here?", "Nta my mom told me and my siblings that if we didn\u2019t like her cooking than we should go to our next door neighbors to eat.", "NTA, your girlfriend is just a drama queen.  Ignore her for a while until she comes to you. Let her cook her own food from now own", "NTA. If she doesn't like your food, she should cook for herself!", "NTA, but do the grown up thing and communicate with her along the lines of:\nIt hurts my feelings when you are so critical about my cooking and takes the joy out of it. I feel unappreciated and unmotivated to cook again. Is there a reason why you are focusing so much on what you don't like in my food?\nThere might be something going on that she hasn't shared with you yet. If so, discuss how you can find a compromise. If there is no good reason, then it's perfectly reasonable to say that you won't cook for her again or say something like: if you keep being negative, I will leave the room.", "NTA - totally fair , I wouldn\u2019t want to cook for someone who constantly complains", "NTA", "NTA. \nShe can critique, or she can eat, not both.", "NTA. She's being a spoiled brat. She wants it both ways. You're bending over backwards into a pretzel and she's still complaining. Let her cook for herself. \n\nThis isn't a situation where you're making a type of food you know she doesn't like. Or using an ingredient you know she doesn't like. She sounds overly demanding and picky.", "NTA! You have a right to express how you felt. Cooking is not easy and takes time spent in the kitchen, so it's not easy constantly having someone criticise it. Over time, it'll make you lose the joy in cooking, so you acted acceptably. Since you've already asked her multiple times what you could change and it didn't work, maybe try cooking together. It'll allow you to see what you two do differently in the kitchen or even take a cooking class :)", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Is it only the cooking or is she always looking for flaws in other things you do? If she is then it\u2019s a bigger issue.", "Your gf is a litte B - NTA stop cooking for her", "No you are NOT the AH. She made a mountain out of a mole hill. What else will be an emotional rollercoaster in your future together? \n\nWhen people show their true selves the first time, believe them. The reaction was straight up emotional manipulation.  \n\nHaving a hissy fit over someone's cooked food. What's next, she won't like your clothes or your friends? You'll have to ditch them? Be wary, my dude. Ypu really have to watch for red flags closely. This sounds like red flag number one.", "NTA. \n\nWhile I am definitely open to feedback on my cooking and don't expect the people in my life to like everything I cook, if they repeatedly told me they didn't like what I was cooking, I would also stop cooking for them. My partner over time has told me what he likes/what he doesn't like, and when I try a new recipe I definitely want to know what he thinks. But if on a daily basis, he was telling me stuff didn't taste good/he didn't like it, he'd be on his own for dinner. Not out of spite, but because clearly we aren't on the same page about food and I'm not going to cook food someone doesn't like. \n\nIn your case, your girlfriend feels it is okay to criticize your food but when you tell her to cook for herself, has a meltdown and ignores you? Just because she has a big reaction doesn't mean you have to wonder if you were wrong. You weren't wrong. And you should stick with her cooking for herself. While she is ignoring you, just start cooking dinner for one, and when that leads to a fight, let it. Let her explain to you why you should cook for her when she doesn't like your food, and keep cooking for her when she ignores you after you raised your frustration.", "NTA. Why would she continue to eat food she doesn't like?\n\n> didn't take it and well and started crying and left the kitchen. Now she's ignoring me.\r  \n\r\n\nYour girlfriend is being manipulative. She's trying to use guilt and silent treatment to prevent you from airing a reasonable grievance about the way she's treating you.", "She either needs to put up and shut up.\n\nOr cook for herself\n\nNTA she needs to stop being so ungreatful.", "NTA. I also love cooking and I want my husbands input on a dish but it needs to have actual ways it would be better or a good reason he doesn\u2019t like it. He and I usually enjoy the same things but if there\u2019s a dish he doesn\u2019t like but I love he just tells me to let him know that\u2019s what I\u2019m making and he\u2019ll make his own food that night. But just constantly complaining is rude.", "NTA. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.", "NTA.  If GF can't say what's wrong with your cooking, then the problem isn't your cooking.  You should pay attention to how she's feeling and you need to talk to her about it.\nRegarding having her do some of the cooking, she should!  Sometimes we take the work our SOs do for granted.  She needs to share the cooking job just so she appreciates what you do.", "NTA. I rarely do the cooking in my house and I tell my wife all the time that if I don't have to make it, I'm not complaining. The only time I ever say anything is if she says she doesn't like it and I didn't either", "NTA\nYou have made the effort to change your cooking for her but she is not interested and crying really just sit down with her and tell her in a less aggravated mood how you feel about this and if she has anymore issues she is just being childish.", "NTA my momma, who couldn't cook, always said \"if you can't do better, don't criticize.\" I can't cook, so anyone who cooks for me gets compliments and thanks. Even if it was not so good, because *I didn't have to make it*!", "NTA, but GF sounds like she's taking the passive-aggressive approach to the breakup she apparently wants. \n\nOr maybe she's pregnant. Or has some other issues? How's her health generally?", "NTA - This isn't about the food. It's about manipulating you. Dump this woman and let her play games and test boundaries with somebody else.", "NTA, there's a difference between constructive criticism to help match tastes and all out disrespect.  My family ALWAYS says \"thank you\" and \"that was good\" to whoever is the cook that night. But if there is something they don't like, they respectfully let me know their preferences (my two kids are 15, so this was definitely a learning experience). Of course, I've also taught them how to cook so they have the basics down. Just no finesse or imagination yet. \n\n\nShe's crying because she's having to deal with your outburst.    1. You hurt her feelings but she knows she also hurt yours and might not know how to deal with it. \n2. She can't take accountability for hurting your feelings and is only selfish about yourgetting on to her. \n3. Is using tears as a manipulation. \n\nHopefully not 3. But when me and my husband argue, one time he got so mad at me he threw his jeans against the wall. And it scared me, and hurt my feelings and I cried. Lol. And I went to the room because I was embarrassed. Lol. It's funny now. But I felt like a loser then. When you tell her you feel unappreciated (and you need to give her some examples how you feel appreciated), she should be open and receptive to engage in participating in those acts that show you appreciation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
