Your GF sounds a little controlling and didn't like it when you stood up for yourself.", "NTA, if someone wants something to change but cannot or will not express how said thing should change....then they lose the right to complain about said thing. Also, crying and ignoring you because you expressed your feelings is manipulation on her part even if she doesn't realize it. She's trying to get away with making you feel bad for your reaction to her behaviour by upping the emotional reaction on her end in an attempt to make you feel guilty. Then even though you were the one originally hurt/upset/however you want to phrase it, it ends up becoming about her and her emotions with you soothing her and trying to get her to stop ignoring you rather than the other way around. Again, this may be a learned behaviour and not necessarily malicious but it is probably the most common form of manipulation I see in relationships and it will inevitably lead to serious resentment on your part if this is how she continues to react to any negative emotions expressed by you.", "NTA, she can absolutely cook her own food, it is not your responsibility to bend over backwards to her whims.", "You really need to ask yourself if the relationship is worth it.

But if on a daily basis, he was telling me stuff didn't taste good/he didn't like it, he'd be on his own for dinner. Not out of spite, but because clearly we aren't on the same page about food and I'm not going to cook food someone doesn't like. \n\nIn your case, your girlfriend feels it is okay to criticize your food but when you tell her to cook for herself, has a meltdown and ignores you? Just because she has a big reaction doesn't mean you have to wonder if you were wrong. You weren't wrong. And you should stick with her cooking for herself. While she is ignoring you, just start cooking dinner for one, and when that leads to a fight, let it. Let her explain to you why you should cook for her when she doesn't like your food, and keep cooking for her when she ignores you after you raised your frustration.", "NTA. Why would she continue to eat food she doesn't like?\n\n> didn't take it and well and started crying and left the kitchen. Now she's ignoring me.\r  \n\r\n\nYour girlfriend is being manipulative.

I also love cooking and I want my husbands input on a dish but it needs to have actual ways it would be better or a good reason he doesn\u2019t like it.

You should pay attention to how she's feeling and you need to talk to her about it.\nRegarding having her do some of the cooking, she should!  Sometimes we take the work our SOs do for granted.  She needs to share the cooking job just so she appreciates what you do.", "NTA. I rarely do the cooking in my house and I tell my wife all the time that if I don't have to make it, I'm not complaining. The only time I ever say anything is if she says she doesn't like it and I didn't either", "NTA\nYou have made the effort to change your cooking for her but she is not interested and crying really just sit down with her and tell her in a less aggravated mood how you feel about this and if she has anymore issues she is just being childish.", "NTA my momma, who couldn't cook, always said \"if you can't do better, don't criticize.\" I can't cook, so anyone who cooks for me gets compliments and thanks.

Or has some other issues? How's her health generally?", "NTA - This isn't about the food. It's about manipulating you. Dump this woman and let her play games and test boundaries with somebody else.", "NTA, there's a difference between constructive criticism to help match tastes and all out disrespect.  My family ALWAYS says \"thank you\" and \"that was good\" to whoever is the cook that night. But if there is something they don't like, they respectfully let me know their preferences (my two kids are 15, so this was definitely a learning experience). Of course, I've also taught them how to cook so they have the basics down. Just no finesse or imagination yet. \n\n\nShe's crying because she's having to deal with your outburst.    1. You hurt her feelings but she knows she also hurt yours and might not know how to deal with it. \n2. She can't take accountability for hurting your feelings and is only selfish about yourgetting on to her. \n3. Is using tears as a manipulation. \n\nHopefully not 3. But when me and my husband argue, one time he got so mad at me he threw his jeans against the wall. And it scared me, and hurt my feelings and I cried. Lol. And I went to the room because I was embarrassed. Lol. It's funny now. But I felt like a loser then.

My boyfriend is like this and I\u2019ve started telling him that if he can\u2019t give me specifics on what he doesn\u2019t like about it then stop complaining. Although he\u2019s usually more like \u201cthis is good but somethings  off about it\u201d. I couldn\u2019t believe I had to tell him that he needs to be specific or I can\u2019t fix it but hey", "NTA\n\nLook, I get that picky people exist, but it sounds less like she's picky and more like she's criticizing you to criticize you. We get posts like this here or there, and invariably the conclusion I feel I draw most times is that the person not having a single good thing to say about the others food is either deliberately trying to knock their ego for something they feel good about or they're trying to gas themselves up. \n\nFrankly the on a dime mood shift to tears over a simple statement is also not a good look. Either she's too sensitive or she knows how to put that shit on.", "Depends how you said it. If you yelled it, it could have been a dick move. But honestly, if she has specific preferences she needs to learn how to cook well.", "NTA She just likes insulting you and uses your cooking to do it. She thinks it is OK to do it, too. That on top of being lazy. She didn't like getting called out on her AH behavior which she certainly knew was asshole because she was enjoying being one.", "NTA. I told my ex the same. Don\u2019t like my food? You cook then.", "NTA \n\nWe\u2019re all entitled to our own tastes but it sounds like she has a problem with the food not being exactly to the point of how she wants it despite still being tasty enough food.\n\nAnd the main problem is that she shouldn\u2019t be complaining about your food when you\u2019re already cooking for her out of kindness, like the \u201cdon\u2019t look a gift horse on the mouth\u201d saying, she\u2019s taking your cooking for granted and complaining that it isn\u2019t good enough as if you were a free maid", "Tell her maybe you should cry and stomp off and give the silent treatment over her nasty comments. Maybe next time she should just say \"thanks for cooking again, babe. It was great!\" Anything else she is being an AH. Or she can take some turns. She doesn't want to cook? Well then she can shut up or make other arrangements because she is being rude and ungrateful. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n>She didn't take it and well and started crying and left the kitchen. Now she's ignoring me.\n\nAll of that is pure manipulation. Manipulative people make terrible partners because they're mentally and emotionally abusive. \n\nOffer her the opportunity to self-correct, but also be clear that not correcting her behavior isn't an option. This is the tip of an iceberg. Take a sec and ponder the mass and structure of icebergs. Don't be like the Titanic. It's just not healthy.", "No NTA. Have y'all tried cooking together a dish you both enjoy? That might help", "NTA- You\u2019re not obligated to cook for her. Fast food exists if she doesn\u2019t have the skill. But I would definitely calmly communicate my issues. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is the one who cooks in our family. I prep his lunches but he makes all dinners. I make breakfasts for our toddler and I as well as him on the weekends. He is aware I am insecure with my cooking and will only make thanksgiving dinner with a audience. (As he is very well versed in technique and such) he laughed behind me while cooking (IDK about what but I was already anxious with him behind me) I threw the spatula in the sink and just started crying (I am also very hormonal right now) and made him finish his food. It wasn\u2019t ours it was his and I can make a single portion after my coffee. Instead of reacting to my reaction he finished his food and ate. Once I was ready I apologized and reaffirmed my rule of not being in the kitchen while I cook. My food isn\u2019t bad it\u2019s just basic where we can make elaborate and delicious restaurant quality food. That\u2019s okay. I would never expect him to feed me after insulting his food just as he did not expect me to feed him after I perceived an insult to my technique. (I prep toddler\u2019s food at night so he is not screaming to eat.)", "Nta. She needs some time off your food, really - make single portions of everything you eat until she apologizes", "NTA unless you yelled/raised your voice. Some people, like me, have CPTSD from growing up in neglectful/abusive/addiction households. I do great with most things/events/situations, but if my partner raises his voice, even if it is not about me, I cry. I can't control it, and it rarely happens, but now that I know about Complex PTSD and childhood traumas, I at least know why it happens. If you didn't raise your voice or be sarcastic or angry about it, then you are NTA.", "What's that famous saying about the hand that feed you?", "Is she pregnant????", "NTA\n\nHas she perhaps experienced anything recently that might affect her taste buds? Did she ever have COVID? Is she pregnant?\n\nShe needs to accept that you've tried, you feel hurt, and it's her turn to take steps to solve her own issue and give you some compassion.", "I agree that if she doesn", "NTA. When my husband cooks for me I never say anything negative about the food (usually there isn\u2019t negative things to say but I wouldn\u2019t even if there were) I\u2019m just thankful that I didn\u2019t have to make dinner. Your girlfriend sounds immature, if she doesn\u2019t have anything constructive to say then she should just be happy that you made dinner and she didn\u2019t have to.", "As an incredibly picky eater, I can safely say....definitely NTA\n\nWhen my fiance cooks for me, I find it so incredibly sweet and kind of him, and it's the same in reverse (except between the two of us, he's definitely the chef haha). Even if I can't stand the taste, I'll still eat it (or try to at the very least). I'll usually let him down easy and say something at the end like \"Oh, it's alright, but I really like it more when you cook X dish instead\" and he'll usually understand - he knew I was a picky eater from early on and he knew I was trying to get better at it, so it's not that much of a surprise if I don't like something very much.\n\nYou made food for her. That was a very kind gesture, especially after how many times she's criticized you in the past. I hope she gets her act together and grows up, or has a damn good explanation for why she's acting like she is about all this.", "NTA. OP\u2019s girlfriend is rude and uses weaponized fake tears when things don\u2019t go her way.", "NTA. I cook 95% of the time. My wife will sometimes make some constructive comments. Too much garlic, needed more onion, but never says she doesnt like what i make. I het home before her so supper is generally ready or nearly ready when she comes through the door. I dont think she would ever say its bad out of fear i would quit doing it.", "I love cooking and baking, I also enjoy testing recipes of all kinds. I would recommend always taking turns cooking, it makes it easier for each of you to have a meal you bith like. If you are living together, you can do an 'every other day' routine and try a new recipe on day 7. Make more of what you both enjoy and save it in the freezer for instances where either of you aren't enjoying that day's meal. Cook together and come up with a meal schedule / plan, that way you'll both know exactly what is going into each meal and you'll both be able to express ingredient preferences, for example; I prefer more hot sauce, chili, cheese, veg OR I prefer less salt, that particular spice, etc etc.\n\nAs for her behavior, it IS okay to not like something, but at the age of 20 something?, it is NOT okay to act like a toddler about it, which brings me back to the point if making extra of what you both like and freezing it for such occasions. You, most definitely, are not the AH. And, let's be entirely honest, it is a reasonable suggestion that she cooks or hears up something she prefers, if she doesn't like what you made, it's what grown-ups do...", "lol ohh my I laughed so hard at this. NTA. I did exactly this to my husband about 6-7 months into our relationship. He learned how to cook and now he doesn\u2019t complain (well rarely) when I do. Good luck internet dude.", "Well, at least she knows how to make crocodile tears.", "NTA", "Nta. Could she be pregnant? I mean, you mentioned that she said the food tasted different even tho it was something that you already made before, and the crying, is kinda extreme to cry because you told her to cook her own food.", "NTA, she's immature. I tell my spouse of 15 years this all the time - if you don't like it, fend for yourself so I can have the leftovers.", "NTA, but try cooking together. My wife and I cook together every day. She takes the lead and I'm more of the sous chef. If you can't do things with your partner, then that's not a partnership.", "Ahhhh, the poor little princess doesn't like being told to be an adult.\n\nShe's an asshole, OP.\n\nBut you're not (NTA).  A question though.... why are you dating someone that's emotionally a child?", "I bet she's had COVID. \n\nNTA", "Have you told her how her criticisms make you feel? From how you first described the dynamic between the two of you, she may think you are asking for her advice on how to improve your culinary creations and that is her contribution to the meals. Her reaction implies she didn\u2019t think she was doing anything wrong. If you haven\u2019t already done so, perhaps tell her that you need to hear what she likes about your meals too.", "My DH and I have the same arrangement for the same reasons. My rule is always appreciate, offer sincere compliments when something is great, and provide constructive feedback only when solicited (which he always asks for - he wants to keep improving). It works for us. \n\nMaybe talk to your partner about other ways of communicating food preferences? This sounds like it may be a communication and expectation issue - she may think she's being a helpful participant offering her opinions, and cried because you were upset by what she considered helpful constructive feedback....\n\nYou definitely weren't an AH, but I'm not convinced she was an AH either so... NAH.", "NTA I think you need to split cooking duty half & half", "NTA\n\nI enjoy cooking and tolerate meal planning. My partner likes cooking and hates meal planning. So I do most of the cooking.\n\nI\u2019ve made a few awful meals in 7 years together but he only comments if asked for feedback. Which is the polite thing to do. If he really hated something I guess he\u2019d tell me, but it hasn\u2019t come to that. \n\nThat said, I do cook to his tastes in terms of salt and seasonings. I make spicy food milder for me and supply him an array of homemade hot sauces if needed.", "Right? My husband doesn\u2019t cook, so if I\u2019m too tired to cook (big hobby of mine, I do it 99% of the time), I\u2019m lucky if I get a stir fry instead of chicken tenders.\n\nAnd either way, I am just happy that I could put my feet up when I needed to skip that chore.", "I agreee he\u2019s not an asshole but It\u2019s perfectly fine to be picky as an adult too. not everyone\u2019s palette is the same and if you just don\u2019t like something then you don\u2019t like it nothing wrong with that just be transparent about it and don\u2019t be a dick about it as long as you\u2019re willing to try things there\u2019s nothing wrong with not liking them", "I\u2019m older so my mum comes to visit me, do you think I should tell her to join my neighbours for dinner if she doesn\u2019t like it?
