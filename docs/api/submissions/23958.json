Your GF sounds a little controlling and didn't like it when you stood up for yourself.", "NTA, if someone wants something to change but cannot or will not express how said thing should change....then they lose the right to complain about said thing. Also, crying and ignoring you because you expressed your feelings is manipulation on her part even if she doesn't realize it. She's trying to get away with making you feel bad for your reaction to her behaviour by upping the emotional reaction on her end in an attempt to make you feel guilty. Then even though you were the one originally hurt/upset/however you want to phrase it, it ends up becoming about her and her emotions with you soothing her and trying to get her to stop ignoring you rather than the other way around. Again, this may be a learned behaviour and not necessarily malicious but it is probably the most common form of manipulation I see in relationships and it will inevitably lead to serious resentment on your part if this is how she continues to react to any negative emotions expressed by you.", "NTA, she can absolutely cook her own food, it is not your responsibility to bend over backwards to her whims.", "You really need to ask yourself if the relationship is worth it.

She made a mountain out of a mole hill. What else will be an emotional rollercoaster in your future together? \n\nWhen people show their true selves the first time, believe them.

But if on a daily basis, he was telling me stuff didn't taste good/he didn't like it, he'd be on his own for dinner. Not out of spite, but because clearly we aren't on the same page about food and I'm not going to cook food someone doesn't like. \n\nIn your case, your girlfriend feels it is okay to criticize your food but when you tell her to cook for herself, has a meltdown and ignores you? Just because she has a big reaction doesn't mean you have to wonder if you were wrong. You weren't wrong. And you should stick with her cooking for herself. While she is ignoring you, just start cooking dinner for one, and when that leads to a fight, let it. Let her explain to you why you should cook for her when she doesn't like your food, and keep cooking for her when she ignores you after you raised your frustration.", "NTA. Why would she continue to eat food she doesn't like?\n\n> didn't take it and well and started crying and left the kitchen. Now she's ignoring me.\r  \n\r\n\nYour girlfriend is being manipulative.

I also love cooking and I want my husbands input on a dish but it needs to have actual ways it would be better or a good reason he doesn\u2019t like it.

You should pay attention to how she's feeling and you need to talk to her about it.\nRegarding having her do some of the cooking, she should!  Sometimes we take the work our SOs do for granted.  She needs to share the cooking job just so she appreciates what you do.", "NTA. I rarely do the cooking in my house and I tell my wife all the time that if I don't have to make it, I'm not complaining. The only time I ever say anything is if she says she doesn't like it and I didn't either", "NTA\nYou have made the effort to change your cooking for her but she is not interested and crying really just sit down with her and tell her in a less aggravated mood how you feel about this and if she has anymore issues she is just being childish.", "NTA my momma, who couldn't cook, always said \"if you can't do better, don't criticize.\" I can't cook, so anyone who cooks for me gets compliments and thanks. Even if it was not so good, because *I didn't have to make it*!", "NTA, but GF sounds like she's taking the passive-aggressive approach to the breakup she apparently wants. \n\nOr maybe she's pregnant. Or has some other issues? How's her health generally?", "NTA - This isn't about the food. It's about manipulating you. Dump this woman and let her play games and test boundaries with somebody else.", "NTA, there's a difference between constructive criticism to help match tastes and all out disrespect.  My family ALWAYS says \"thank you\" and \"that was good\" to whoever is the cook that night. But if there is something they don't like, they respectfully let me know their preferences (my two kids are 15, so this was definitely a learning experience). Of course, I've also taught them how to cook so they have the basics down. Just no finesse or imagination yet. \n\n\nShe's crying because she's having to deal with your outburst.    1. You hurt her feelings but she knows she also hurt yours and might not know how to deal with it. \n2. She can't take accountability for hurting your feelings and is only selfish about yourgetting on to her. \n3. Is using tears as a manipulation. \n\nHopefully not 3. But when me and my husband argue, one time he got so mad at me he threw his jeans against the wall. And it scared me, and hurt my feelings and I cried. Lol. And I went to the room because I was embarrassed. Lol. It's funny now. But I felt like a loser then.

Not that it makes it ok, just that there might be some bigger happening in the background.", "I was more wondering if this was some sort of manipulation tactic, like the dude who kept telling heis gf she smelled bad every day as a tactic to drop her self steal so she never left him", "Does being in a bag mood make you hurt your partner?", "Is she pregnant? Since it may change her sense of taste and become more sensitive. If not, she is just rude and can cook for herself. NTA", "My daughter cooked dinner for me recently. She was a little concerned about how good it was.\n\nI told her it was excellent (it was) but that even if it had been mediocre or worse, it was a dinner that I didn't have to cook! Which made it great no matter what. NTA.", "Damn I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dating my ex. \n\nNTA, better get out now she only gets worse.", "NTA, and turning on the waterworks simply because someone's criticised your constant criticism is immature.", "NTA. You're her partner, not her personal chef. If she doesn't value your efforts and makes comments like that, I think you may have a problem there. Someone who values you will be grateful for your efforts and will support you. Time to reflect and see if this behaviour extends beyond your cooking. Best of luck.", "Sounds like she can dish it out, but she can't take it in. NTA", "Crying is more than immaturity it is emotional manipulation. My sister ruined my brother\u2019s wedding and then \u2018bumped her head\u2019 and started crying about that too like a toddler yeah immaturity but also using tears as a defence against criticism for abhorrent behaviour.", "If the food is bad you should be able to say so. But to find something wrong with every dish is that person being an asshole.", " I think the gf upgraded weaponised incompetence. She doesn't cook,  even if she can, AND she offends op's\n cooking AND stormed out crying.", "Can be a lingering effect of c19 infections as well.  I know people who have had everything taste awful [like rotting meat] for over a year post infection.", "I remember that one so vividly I thought it was a fever dream", "Don't fall for that shit OP", "NTA, 'if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.....'  \nIf she doesn't want to eat anything else, then why on earth is she criticizing your cooking?", "NTA. It's ok for her to criticize your cooking but not ok for you to criticize hey behavior. It's a bit immature.", "NTA.\n\nSeems like She is trying to tell you something else, or just testing you with passive agressive behaviour.", "NTA she's treating you like you work for her as a cook, and like she's your boss and she's trying to make you do your job her way.", "Agreed which is why I stated pay attention."]}
