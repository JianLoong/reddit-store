And as much as I hate hustle culture, good on you for finding your knack and making a comfortable life for yourself!

Just curious, as I never thought of him as being a hitman.", "NTA. You had a cruel relative say rude things to you, and your awesome BF made an awesome shirt for you. And this woman had the gall to say it was your SHIRT that was offensive? \n\nNo, honey, what she said to your relative last week was offensive. The shirt is awesome and funny (it even bleeps out the swear word)! And if Emily isn't a fool, she already knows this. Tell her to stop making dumb excuses and to apologize to you already.", "NTA. She was reportedly ready to apologize. But you had no way of knowing that was what she was planning. The fact that she did not apologize earlier in the week when your aunt did, or at any point leading up to this weekend is not indicative of her wanting to bury the hatchet.
