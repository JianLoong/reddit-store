An agreed amount of luxury spending by BOTH partners should not be subject to oversight by the other partner, as long as it is within the limit. I am actually in favor of \u201chiding\u201d this by using a separate account because doing so helps both people treat it as one single budget and discuss it as a whole rather than judging the individual pieces. It lets each partner optimize for themselves without stress of the other knowing.\n\nThe important thing is that the transfers to those luxury accounts are open and honest with both partners.\n\nI agree OP is NTA and the husband is treating this very wrong. But there\u2019s no reason they both can\u2019t use tools to improve the situation.", "I'm sure you say that to everyone in an abusive relationship... I guess you are not a counsellor...", "His trauma doesn\u2019t make it not abusive."]}
