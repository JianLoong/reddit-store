Reduce the number of shared cards to one or two max. Make sure they are not very high credit limit cards. \n\nYou should not have to watch every nickel and dime at your level of income - you should have enough cushion in the bank to cover discretionary spending for each of you and the kids.\n\nYou can have a talk with him about each of you getting x amount of money each month that you can spend with no questions asked. Major purchases should so be discussed with the spouse.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if it still doesn\u2019t work. \n\nI am sorry you are going through this harassment.", "I think it's more the order of it. I agree they could benefit from couples counseling, but not before he works through some of his own issues first. I don't see him being able to listen to or be ready to talk about the issues OP may bring up without introspection and willingness. I don't think couples counseling will be fruitful until he makes some individual progress first. \n\nIt definitely seems like a possibility. I normally wouldn't advocate for one partner managing the finances, but his recklessness and lack of transparency is really worrying. My partner and I notify each other on all purchases and do accounting together regularly to make sure we know where all our money is going. I cannot imagine purchasing a sports card for 5k unless I was so wealthy that money was meaningless.", "Sounds like you still do much, if not most, of the work for your family both inside & outside your home. It doesn't sound like he contributes much at all.\n\nHe brings in no money & you are the breadwinner while he stays home & does what? You grocery shop, clothes shop for the kids, earn ALL the money, do housework. What does he do for your family? What does he actually contribute?\n\nedit spelling", "NTA but you will be if you don\u2019t take a step back and see the situation how we are. He\u2019s doing less than the bare minimum. You\u2019re the one bringing in all money for the house hold, taking on the mental burdens of cooking, grocery shopping and who knows what else. Maybe take a minute to sit down and write what each of you contributes to the household because it sounds like he\u2019s contributing less than three hours a day (get kids ready, pick up and drop off which means he\u2019s not even doing childcare during the day and yet he\u2019s only doing half of the laundry). He\u2019s not being a good spouse and it\u2019s going to hurt you in the long run (either by this festering, you burning out, it wouldn\u2019t even surprise me if he keeps doing less and less until eventually you\u2019re 100% in charge instead of 90% like you are now). Talk to your support system, go to therapy, heck even consider living separately for a little bit so it\u2019s clear how little he actually contributes. I hope everything works out op because you deserve so much better than this", "I am not the original commenter but it sure sounds like he does just about his fair share .... if he also was working full time!", "Your expectations of him as a stay at home parent were not too high. As the breadwinner, you should not be responsible for >50% of the domestic labor. He sounds immature.", "This was an alternative to a secret credit card OP mentioned wanting, which seems more like a relationship killer to me. But I agree neither are great ideas - OP should do couples counseling.", "So you still trust him?", "Why isn't the money his?", "That puts a different light on it. Changing my verdict to NTA.", "So, you are \"guilty\" of speaking the truth when he tries to lie and blame you for the debt he brought into your lives and didn't take responsibility for?\n\nForget couples counseling, OP.  Get individual therapy.  Your sense of reality has been distorted by this manipulative, projecting asshole.", "He can't take out a second mortgage.  He doesn't have a 401K.  And he has no access to the kids college savings.  So, I think we are good there.  Thank you for the brainstorming tho.", "Well, we are quibbling over it because he's making an issue out of it.  Am I supposed to cancel the subscription because he doesn't like it?  We are more than able to afford it and I use it (for a podcast I listen to).  The issue is that I have to justify all of my purchases to HIS satisfaction but I don't say a word about any of his purchases.  I don't care what he buys.", "I disagree. They are partners, who brings in the money is irrelevant. They should be working together on their shared finances.", "Yeah.... hard disagree with this. In any family with one income, the money is not just \"the breadwinner's\" finances, it's THE FAMILY'S finances. Because that's also a form of financial abuse, if the breadwinner is all \"I make the money so you don't get any say in how it's spent.\"\n\nHusband in this case is WAY out of line, he's clearly angry about his failed business/ unemployment and lashing out at OP, being way overly controlling because he feels out of control. \n\nBut they need to sit down and make a budget **together**, one that includes money for expenses, savings, and also something allocated towards \"wants\" where they both can spend as they like within agreed parameters. \n\nOP is NTA but this is a problem that needs attention stat! Counseling and/or a financial advisor who can help you come up with a budget. Otherwise... you will just keep picking at each other until you explode.", "He has no business being controlling of her finances, for sure. But they're partners. They need to at least be on the same page, which just means communication about it. What he's doing isn't that.", "Inb4 alimony and spousal support", "If you don't edit your top level comment the bot won't count your vote change", "Your partner is knocking on 50 with no retirement savings, no budget for discretionary spending and decreasing skills.  He doesn't take on 50% of the household responsibilities.  How do you see the next 20 years of your life going, OP?\n\nInstead of an empty nest, you are going to have aging duckling who has nothing to do with his beak, but peck at you.  Once taking the children to school is off his plate, what is he going to do with his waking hours other than scrutinize you and blame you for his unproductive life?\n\nIt would be one thing if he were using this time to pursue passions or interests, but given that he is using it to pursue $5 credit card purchases, this doesn't bode well for either of you.   \n\nGet a budget and expectations for him to make contributions to your shared retirement.  No fun money budget with shared finances is a recipe for argument.", "He needs to stop trying to control you. Both individual and marriage counseling can help him.", "Then get a seperate checking acct from him and go paperless with the acct\n\nSave it for a rainy day or like you said for your personal expenses\n\nIf your paying all bills no problem i see no issue\n\nAnd if its abojt him not having money for frivilous things make a seperate acct for him too for fun money\n\nEither way he needs to get off your back\n\nOr you can itemize every failed d3aling with his business and ask him which items wefe justifi3d", "NTA, and the situation isn't tenable. Even if you are bringing in all the money, your husband must have some insight in the finances. He must even be able to control part of it. If the situation had been reversed, you would not have been happy to be told to eff off.\n\nEdited to change verdict. OP has explained that her husband can spend whatever he likes and that he does have control of their finances."]}
