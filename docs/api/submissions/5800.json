Something isn't right.", "Do any of those bills come in his name? Because if not, him opening them is technically a crime. \n\n\"You don't pay the bills and created all our debt. I will no longer explain my spending to you. I am a grown adult, and I don't need your permission to buy a damn thing. Shut the fuck up. \" Is an appropriate response at this point. He's bickering over $5 and buying clothing for the children. It's petty and childish, especially since he's not bringing in any money into the house. \n\nIf his name is on ANY accounts, it's time to remove his name from them, or keep the bare minimum in that account and open a new one that you deposit your check into. He clearly can't be trusted when it comes to the family finances and doesn't need to know what you spend every dollar on.", "NTA, this is what paperless billing is for OP. I\u2019m the One bringing home the money in a working/SAHM dynamic. My wife does a lot of side gigs for extra money and I never ask her how much she makes. I provide for all the basics and most of the fun stuff. Sometimes she sees something I want and gets it for me. I don\u2019t question it, I run out finances out of my pay, she doesn\u2019t question it. \n\nWe both use paperless billing for 90% of our incomes, why? Because money is a killer to family dynamics. He needs to step up if he feels uncomfortable with money and start making contributions and actually hold a stable decent job. Or he needs to let you run the finances no questions asked. It\u2019s fine to ask for money out of the bulk family funds but if it\u2019s a risky large sum of money it should be talked about and whoever is keeping the family afloat gets the final say in that dynamic, as they know the daily/monthly flow of the money. It\u2019s a trust thing. He doesn\u2019t trust himself let alone you to be managing the money\n\nYour NTA, and he needs to get his shit together", "NTA\n\nMy bank gives you the option to go paperless, receiving digital statements. Can you not look into that?", "Give him an ultimatum, either he starts working or your leaving. He has too much time on his hands.", "NTA but his behavior is worrisome. It either points to something wrong with his own finances (how does he spend his free time at home? Could he have made more debt?), trying to control you with your own finances (maybe he feels controlled by you making the money and wants you to feel the same way?) or he is just bored and this is what he picked as his hobby (which also definitely sucks).", "NTA.  Your husband is veering into financial abuse and if he's not willing to restart couples counseling or do his own, you should look into your own safety.  That secret card is a good idea. I'd also suggest going paperless and making sure he doesn't have online access.", "NTA and this sounds like a very unhealthy dynamic. Tell your husband to get a job and leave you tf alone. He sounds entitled and more than anything i think his ego is bruised and he's trying to take the reins as a \"manly man\" in charge of the finances, even tho he's not bringing any to the table himself. How you choose to spend your money is up to you especially because you work so hard (not to mention, fixed debt that he put you guys in). He should be grateful you don't kick him out or hold finances over his head (which is also a form of abuse/control, so thanks for not being an abuser yourself). This is borderline abusive behaviour from your husband and you should really work through this before it gets worse. Good luck, OP, and happy spending on whatever the eff you want to spend on!", "Ah, that's hard. Normally I'd say that the stay at home parent has just as much voice in the finances as the earning parent because they are both supporting their family, just in different ways. But here he's trying to assume more authority than you over the finances, which is not OK, especially since it sounds like you are the fiscally responsible one and he's less able to manage finances well. You are NTA.", "NTA and I've been in this situation (except I wasn't making $300k, I would be thrilled to make that much) and it was just another symptom of him being a covert passive aggressive narcissistic abuser. \n\nSo like, yeah. He can eff all the way off.", "NTA tell him to get a new job and cut off his access to your finances. Go paperless for your bank statements. Have your salary paid into your own bank account and put a limited allowance into your shared account. He sounds lazy, entitled and downright financially abusive.", "NTA leaving aside how much you earn, it is YOU who brings the money while he has debts that damage your economy. You bring in the income and he brings in the debts, he has no right to control what you spend", "NTA have you considered separate accounts?  A bills account and both have fun money account.  His amount of Paynent to the bills will be proportional to his income and leave 25% for spends.\n\nYour excess income goes to you.", "NTA.\n\nHe's controlling you, plain and simple. Who is he to quiz you on anything that you spend? That's super red flag territory, as is the fact that you tried therapy, but he stopped trusting the therapist (I'm guessing they called him out on his behaviour).", "NTA. \n\nBut maybe you should go through all his bills and ask him what every charge is for. If he's questioning $5 charges with your level of income, then it sounds like he either has residual concerns about your financial position, or he has additional debts that you aren't aware of.", "Unfortunately you can\u2019t even leave this person because then you will have to support him. NTA", "Am I the only one that thinks husband is feeling depressed, anxious, and guilty about not contributing financially to the family, and so trying to compensate by focusing on budgets and spending? I understand OPs frustration, but I feel like husband needs some counselling not an angry mob.", "NTA, good luck I could not stay with that man", "NTA But did you notice the pattern? He distrusts the therapist, he distrusts businesses and their bills, he controls bills down to the cent because he's afraid of scammers and he distrusts you. \n\nCould there be more to it than being controlling? This sounds disturbingly like paranoia. Could you convince him to go see a mental health specialist?", "Why would he worry about a pre-nup when he can just take loans and have you pay, anyway?", "Stay at home dad, trying to be his own boss is a bum, but a stay at home mom would just be great wouldn\u2019t it!", "As someone with a small business, this was my line of thought as well. It's not uncommon to leverage business assets as collateral for loans, but you can also get them against a home, vehicle, or other property. It's very, very easy to sink a lot of money into a business in a short time, especially if you sunk cost fallacy it and think that surely this next 15k will make it work.", "Time for OP to make him spill the beans and then put divorce on the table.\n\nI'm in a stay at home situation thx to covid (and went back to university as consequence) so my hubby is the sole provider. I would NEVER start question his spending habits? I mean, why would i? (And he would never do that to me either)\n\nHere is something really fishy. I can smell it all over the ocean..\n\nOP is NTA.", "Then have a sit down and make an agreement over the amount each of you gets for personal spending each month, that you don't have to account to the other for. Deposit that amount into a seperate account each month if that makes it easier. Having your own discretionary fund makes it clear with minimal discussion.", "Yeah if I were OP I'd turn the tables and demand to see his  credit report (something plenty of banks and credit cards offer in less detail or through the free credit report website) and make sure he wasn't hiding some debt from me, because he's acting weird as hell. Either he's hiding something or he's trying to exert control because he's insecure.", "I don't even know how you go into debt with eBay sales.", "Except he\u2019s not a stay at home dad. That would have been a mutual decision. This guy quit his job to start a business that failed spectacularly. Then he blamed OP for his failure, got another job, quit that, then started trying to control OP\u2019s spending while spending whatever he wants whenever he wants. He\u2019s a bum. Also, a leech and insecure af.", "So you are cooking and taking care of the kids and working full time and the few chores left over are split evenly between you 2? Nannies do more work than this supposed stay at home dad is doing and they don't go through your mail and berate you. It sounds like all you get out of this relationship is emotional abuse.", "Your power is in the fact that you provide the sole income for the family. If he wanted that kind of power, he could go back to work, but he hasn't. I don't think there's anything you can do to \"give him more equal relational power\" aside from making your respective situations more equal -- forcing him to go back to work or nitpicking *his* every purchase, neither of which you seem keen to do.", "I like how that one person left out that the husband surely worked, wanted to start a business, failed and now OP has to pay that shit off. Without the debt it would be a different situation. I honestly want to know how they did kids/household when both were working pre-Covid.", "Check the kid\u2019s credit. You don\u2019t think he has cards using their social security numbers?", "I do. Because I forget to check the notifications", "I do, but not willingly. For 6 years I've been trying to get this small credit union I'm a member of to stop sending me statements.\n\nI've filled out their form and faxed it back, I've checked the box online, I've called customer service, I now even have a personal banker.\n\nEvery time they tell me I'm good to go and will no longer receive statements... and every month another statement shows up in the mail, haha.\n\nThey're an absolutely amazing credit union so something that would usually drive me insane actually feels like a cute anecdote.\n\nIt's amazing what a big effect my perspective of them determines how I feel about it.", "The thing is though, if they are on a joint account then he would still have access. If it is already a sole account, technically he shouldn't have access but if she's setting it up a new account or sorting online access to an existing account and he opens the post before she gets home, he might be get access to the information regardless. It may require a conversation with the banking provider/visit to her branch to stop the account access information being mailed to her home address.", "Same with my mom. We went to family counseling, and she puts on this \"perfect Christian woman\" fa\u00e7ade when in public. It basically ended up me being told to behave every week when she would tell me things like nobody would ever love me, that I was a nuisance, and that I didn't deserve privacy when it was just us. It never improved anything because she was being validated and my feelings never mattered.", "He\u2019s insecure. His business failed and he assumed the role of stay at home dad which OP said that she\u2019s fine with since she makes enough (before the debt), he\u2019s watching the kids, and taking care of house chores.\n\nBums don\u2019t even try. Not arguing with the fact that he\u2019s still TA here.", "He\u2019s not her husband, he\u2019s her overgrown son.", "Agreed. If my partner were to make enough to pay for all our needs, fuck yeah, go you. \n\nI'd GLADLY stay home and do all the work if it was feasible, and have free time here and there for my hobbies in between housework.\n\nRelationships are all about teamwork and communication, and this dude is sorely lacking in both.", "My wasband was like this too. Found out while i was in hospital that he had been playing the brow beaten husband from day one, even when I was working through mat leave, working through his constant mystery injuries and illnesses, working through having cancer. But yeah, my using the money I was earning to pay bills was me wasting it.", "This is straight up financial abuse. Usually that sort of abuse comes from the breadwinner, which is why your situation is a bit odd, but it's clearly financial abuse.", "Ugh. You\u2019re busy \u2026 but is this how you want to spend the rest of your life? A partner should add joy & support to life\u2019s ups & downs. Your husband is (currently?) adding stress, frustration, debt & abuse.\n\nNTA. You deserve better.", "I... am so confused. \n\nI own actual small businesses, licensed and taxed and all that shit. \n\nIt's cheap AF, and not that hard. \n\nAnd an eBay/Amazon business is even easier.\n\nLike, FFS, how do you even lose money at that? It's literally just bulk buying cheap garbage and flipping it for an extra dollar, or finding random cool shit in thrift stores. \n\nAnd christ, I had a food cart pre-covid. They're high risk, but with ridiculous cash flow once you become established. \n\nJust... WTF. On every level, What. The. Fuck.", "NTA. \n\nGo to annual credit report dot com and pull your kids' credit files and lock them down to avoid anyone accessing their credit before the kids are legally able to themselves.  \n\nCheck yours. Check his. Lock down yours. \n\nDo not tell him you're doing this. \n\nStart documenting these things and interactions.  Protect yourself and your kids for future need of it. If there's escalation of behavior or a divorce, you're going to need it.", "I wouldn\u2019t be too quick on the draw on marriage counseling. For many people, it becomes one more way to be abused. This man stops trusting counselors \u2014 and probably because he stops hearing what he wants to hear during sessions.", "Yes seperate accounts!!! OP hopefully you have a prenuptial of some sort. But time to put your earnings into a seperafe account and allot the needed amount for bills & \"his money\" whatever you are giving him to cover basic needs he takes care of. Give a set amount and NO INCREASE without something YOU agree to. \n\nLock down finances where you can moniter them. He is up to something shitty, maybe just financial abuse but it seems like more even. \n\nBut most of all OP you are NTA. You are correct he is treating you shitty and even wanting to deprive your kids. Take control before its too late.", "OP the power dynamic is him having control over you, not the other way around.", "I think you misunderstood this comment and flipped it on it's head OP. The commenter is saying you have the power to leave and to make change, not that your husband is deserving of more power to make him feel less immaculate. He did that part all on his own. \n\nYour husband sounds like he has hidden debts and is trying to hide them. That, or he is trying to move your personal money into a separate account elsewhere for him. No one goes into near bankruptcy over buying an selling items on eBay. Nobody. Something is up. \n\nI don't know if he is trying to set you up for alimony and child support for a divorce so he can mooch off of you for life or what, but I'd seriously be wary of this OP. Partners are supposed to support each other. My ex became downright nasty like this when I went to college and got a better job. Said he felt immaculate and sorts of crap. I left him. That's no way to live. \n\nYour husband is controlling you and you need to see that. You aren't the bad guy here. He is holding all the power in your dynamic by beating you down so that you won't realize you can easily break away from him.", "My household income is around 1/3 of that, and a $5 subscription wouldn't even register. OP's husband is just batshit crazy.", "OP, make all your bills paperless.", "OP your husband is financially abusive especially after reading this comment omg.", "We definitely needed this information sooner. I stand on the comments I\u2019ve made - you need a postnuptial agreement to protect yourself from his next great idea. And he needs a job right now, unless you live somewhere that alimony would never be a problem.\n\nI\u2019m not totally against paying never to see someone again. I have an ex I would pay to disappear. The problem is that you have kids. This could go left so fast that I cannot even convey the urgency of getting him out of the house and back into the workforce."]}
