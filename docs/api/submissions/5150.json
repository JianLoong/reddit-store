It doesn't sound like you actually know her travelling budget either \n\nYou sound really incompatible though. She LOVES to travel, you don't and want her to stop travelling. There's going to be resentment brewing, and it sounds like it's coming from you.", "INFO: Do you share finances now? Are you in agreement that buying a house together is one of your future goals? \n\nThis needs to be a serious conversation where you both talk about where you see this relationship going.

She\u2019s spending her money how she wants on something that brings her joy. You literally want her to save it so that if at some point you combine finances you will gain access to he money. It\u2019s NONE of your business.\n\nBesides it sounds like she is saving for retirement and pulling her weight in bills, so I don\u2019t see how this concerns you.", "YTA. Stop thinking of how HER money can benefit YOU. She\u2019s a grown woman.

Sounds like she\u2019s a smart woman.", "YTA. She doesn't owe you a down payment on a house. Why don't you try saving your money instead of trying to spend hers? I would say this is just a couple with mismatched priorities and N A H, but you go clearly into asshole territory with your possessiveness over her finances and dismissiveness of her loss and attempt to find meaning in something she enjoys doing.", "YTA\n\nAnd a spoilsport\n\nAnd a grump", "Just break up already, AH.", "From your comments, it sounds like you\u2019re talking about moving in together but that her priority is not saving for a down payment. How sure are you that you both have the same long term goals?\n\nI have an extremely flexible job-this has caused conflict in my past relationships because I am able to up and leave whenever I want. For about 8 years, I truly loved traveling and being asked to travel less led to feelings of being stifled. Check in with her and find out if traveling seems to be her priority for the coming year.\n\nI get feeling you\u2019re ready to move in, create a long term future and combine finances. From her, I get a sense that she\u2019s exploring, learning about herself and feeling secure in this chapter of her life. I think you need to talk more to see if you are TRULY walking in the same direction or if you\u2019re living a fantasy where you\u2019re wishing she was behaving differently. \n\nPeople show you what is important to them. Believe them.", "YTA reading that put such a bad taste in my mouth. She\u2019s not in debt, she\u2019s saving for the future, it seems like you\u2019re just jealous and controlling.

I mean it may just be grief related, and wanting to do as much as she can while she is young, as her sister did not get to, or it might be she is someone who feels most alive when discovering and exploring. Either way, neither of these are things you get a vote on. \n\nYou don't get to impose your values and your dream of home ownership may not be as important or urgent to her.", "Yup, YTA.  OP should stop trying to claim any right to how someone else spends their money and time.  OP should also realize that he is alienating his GF already.  The latest trip she booked may be her farewell to OP tour.", "\u201cMy girlfriend won\u2019t do what I tell her to with her own money. Am I the AH?\u201d Yes, you are. YTA.", "YTA. She could easily afford 8 trips last year and you couldn't afford one.  Reading between the lines, your GF makes more than you and you're irritated that she isn't saving that excess for you, even though you recognize the therapeutic value to her of these travels.  Instead of talking to her about money, you should be talking about why she feels the constant need to escape from everything, including you.", "YTA a little but its more incompatibility in life. Honestly, I don't fault her for traveling and living her life this way. You two are in a fairly new relationship, you were together only a year when she had this big life change, and it clearly shifted her perspective. Let her travel and do what she needs to do instead of strongarming her into staying with you. You haven't made a serious commitment to each other yet. No finances are combined and she's right. you're counting her pennies on a maybe future. This is what she wants and stopping would make her unhappy. You need to sit with what that means for you and decide your next move accordingly.", "YTA. Are you looking for this woman to pay for things you want in the future because you don't make enough to contribute a fair share? She's not your piggy bank. \n\nIt is HER money, not yours. She works for that and is entitled to spend it on as much trips as she wants. If you keep trying to limit her and control her, you're not going to have a future with her at all.", "YTA \n\nYou definitely shouldn't be counting her pockets. Her money is her money. Why do you think you're entitled to any of it?\n\nWhy should she make her life smaller because you can't afford or don't want to keep up with her travelling?\n\nI 100% agree that she shouldn't have to limit herself because of you. And 8 trips a year isn't even one a month, so she still has lots of free weekends to spend with you. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like you're jealous and instead of being happy for her and supportive of her exploring her hobbies on her own, you're trying to hold her back and using 'but our future' as your reason why. \n\nIf her travelling is making you unhappy, you need to ask yourself why and fix yourself. Don't demand she adjust to make you feel better. \n\nAnd if you can't fix yourself, maybe it's time to realise she isn't the one for you. You don't sound compatible right now. That sucks, but you don't seem happy just now and it's not fair to blame her for that. Own your own happiness.", "YTA\n\nIf your complaint was that she is just physically not there to maintain the relationship because of how much time she spends away, that'd be one thing. But you are definitely an asshole the way you approach this. Its her money, she wants to travel. She is correct in saying that you have no right to count her money.", "YTA. Way to be controlling. Your girlfriend\u2019s travel patterns match my own (and I am married). \n\nAs you could only afford to go on one trip, it\u2019s sounding like you might be jealous. Does she even want the same future as you? Have you discussed this to create joint goals??  If there are joint intentions for a place together, consider asking her to match whoever you can save for a joint down payment on a place together. However, if you are expecting that she NOT travel and save more money than you towards your joint future, I don\u2019t think so.  \n\nIf she\u2019s not in debt from travels, YOU are the controlling one to tell her she can only take 1 trip max a year.", "YTA. Have you put a ring on her finger yet? Then back up you have no say and apparently no money.", "YTA.\nIt\u2019s her money. She gets to decide what to do with it. If you were engaged or married you would have the right to a *conversation* about how the two of you would be combining your finances, and the results of that conversation would have some bearing on the fate of that relationship, but even then you wouldn\u2019t have the right to dictate how she spends her money. It sounds like she enjoys her solo trips, so she\u2019s probably going to keep doing it. If you can\u2019t deal with that, then save the both of you the heartache and end the relationship.", "YTA for your GF essentially deciding she wants to see the world because life is short and you think \"one trip a year with me should be good enough\".\n\nYour guys' interests are likely no longer compatible and that's fine, but don't make the excuse that your presence should be the end all be all of if she goes or not.", "YTA - You've only been together two years and you're already watching and judging her spending her own money. Look at your own situation first before you start judging hers especially if you're only ever able to go on one out of the 8 trips she took. What are you doing with your own money that you can't afford as many trips as she is? It sounds like she's more fiscally responsible than you esp if she's maxing out her retirement, and trip-budgeting smartly, and it's something that brings happiness to her life.", "YTA. You are being extremely controlling. She has told you she's not ready to combine finances or to purchase a home together, you keep pushing but no means no. Her money is hers and hers alone, she's not living beyond her means and has no debt. Get rid of the entitled attitude, count your own money not hers.", "YTA her money, her life, her decision. You aren\u2019t married. There\u2019s no children. Why do you feel she should be funding YOUR future?", "YTA. She\u2019s your girlfriend, not your wife.", "NAH. It just sounds like your priorities aren't compatible.", "YTA\n\nSorry to say that but it seems like your girlfriend is very much okay without you. Also you can't tell her to stay at home. She worked for her own money and she can spend it however she likes it. If she wants to spend it without you that might be a sign to end the relationship.", "YTA. What are you currently doing for your future as a couple bar pissing on her parade?", "Its not your money. Unless you live together and have combined finances, I don't think she'll appreciate you weighing in because its not your money she's spending.\n\nI get a lot out of Me Time. So, its hard to see someone else's perspective as being equally important. Your GF is forging a new identity. She has to figure out who she is now without her sister. And in that regard none of this is about you or where you fit into her life. She's trying to figure out how to be and who she is.\n\n I believe you are entitled to raise all of your concerns. But, don't be surprised if she rejects your suggestions. Its a not a journey you are taking together after all. \n\nNAH. Just people who are trying to figure out what comes next. (If you pressed me on such a matter, I would probably let you go. I can't figure Me out if I don't have the room to do so. And I take for granted that figuring Me out is my right. I get it if you don't want to hang around for that. That would be fine with me.)", "YTA your girlfriend has found something she loves and able to pursue it with finances and her career which is amazing. How about instead of being jealous, be happy for her. If this has helped her heal, who are you to stop it?", "YTA\n\n>  She says I shouldn\u2019t be counting her \u201cpockets\u201d\n\nYeah, p much.", "Yes, YTA. It's not your money. Traveling behind her joy. You just care about yourself. I hope she meets someone wonderful on her next trip and leaves you behind.", " YTA rather than moaning and bitching about your girlfriend living her best life, travelling and doing what she enjoys. Why don\u2019t you focus on your income and earning potential, if your girlfriend is being sensible with pension and savings and travelling isn\u2019t this something you are doing wrong?", "Info, this reads as though you do not live together??", "YTA. She's putting the max in her 401K and still able to afford to do 8 international trips in a year, plus she owns her own home, so clearly she is financial responsible and in a good place so she can do whatever she wants with her money. It's not like she has other financial responsibilities for herself that she isn't meeting. She's meeting ALL of them and then some.\n\n>But I can\u2019t help to think of our future, that money could be used for a down payment on our future house. \n\nSo you're basically just salty that she isn't helping you buy a place. Maybe how about instead of being salty that your gf is in a better place than you financially, you can try to improve yourself/your skills so that you can make more money. That way you can afford to travel and also put money into a home for yourself.", "Yes. Her money. Her trips. YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re being controlling. I hope you don\u2019t mean to be, I\u2019ll go as far as to give you the benefit of the doubt, but seeing the comments should open your eyes if you don\u2019t see it.", "YTA for trying to control how she spends her money. That\u2019s not ok, so stop doing it. However, your concerns are valid, I would share them, and so you have a choice to make, and you\u2019re not TA for that. Stay if you can accept this, and leave if you can\u2019t. That\u2019s how a mature adult handles this properly.", "YTA\n\nThere are far more destructive ways to process grief.  At some point she will run out of places she wants to see.  If you don\u2019t want to wait you can\u2019t hold that against her.  Move on.  Guilt tripping her is only gonna make you a much bigger AH.", "YTA. It\u2019s her money and her time, she can do what she wants with it. It may be worth having a conversation about expectations if you get married or stay together long term. If you want to combine finances and she doesn\u2019t so she can still travel, or if you expect to only travel together it will be a major problem. \n\nYou need to have those conversations asap about how you see your future together. If your plans and expectations don\u2019t align then you need to break up. But you don\u2019t get to unilaterally decide how she uses her own resources.", "YTA - You aren't even engaged and you're trying to control her money. She lost her sister in a shocking, tragic way. It's great that she is finding healing through traveling and seeing the world. Rather than support her in that, you are whining and trying to guilt her so that you can benefit from her money in the future. It's not a good look.", "You\u2019re not married. It isn\u2019t your money. If traveling is a huge priority for her, and you don\u2019t prioritize that, you could be a bad fit. \nYTA, for all those reasons but mostly because you\u2019re trying to control her money when it\u2019s her money, not yours.  If you\u2019re worried about your financial future, make and/or save more money, but don\u2019t piss on your girlfriend\u2019s parade about it.", "YTA You're an entitled, selfish, controlling asshole. She maxes out her 401k, and you've given us no reason to think she's irresponsible with her money.\n\nYou seem jealous. But it also seems like you think she should just sacrifice what she's passionate about to fund your future together. So, what are you sacrificing? Do you eat out, spend money on unnecessary things, or are you saving every single penny for the future?", "YTA. I get you want a future with her but she went through a life change that made something shift. It\u2019s no fault to you or her but she found healing in traveling. It\u2019s something that she loves and can afford. INFO: Have you tried to sit with her and have an open discussion or did you just jump straight to telling her she should cut back on her travels? Maybe she\u2019s saving money toward your future and hasn\u2019t mentioned it yet. Communication is everything.", "YTA as you've said she manages her money well, this is just you being controlling to be honest and also her money is her money, it's not to be used on a down-payment on a house when you guys aren't even living together yet, you've only been together 2 years and plus she literally just lost her sister, like a year is nothing in terms of grief", "Oh honey, I think you and her are just on separate paths. Its reasonable to want a gf that is around and wants to travel with you- and she is perfectly reasonable to do as she wants. NAH", "YTA. It sounds like she can afford to travel and it gives her life meaning. It sounds like you can\u2019t afford to travel and resent seeing what you consider your future money slipping away.

You just sound jealous.", "YTA She needs to find a better partner. That would be the best thing for her future", "I wonder if you have really talked with your girlfriend about her newfound love/need of travel.

Since then she hasn\u2019t stopped. She went on 8 international trips last year.

She\u2019s not in debt or anything but I can\u2019t help but think how much she could be saving if she stops. Her argument is that she\u2019s a budget traveler and people spend more a month eating and getting coffee then her trips have cost her. She puts the maximum in her 401k. Plus she thinks it gives her meaning and she loves it. \n\nBut I can\u2019t help to think of our future, that money could be used for a down payment on our future house. Plus I\u2019m not even going so she\u2019s constantly spending time with me. We recently got into an argument and I told her, her traveling is messing with our future.
