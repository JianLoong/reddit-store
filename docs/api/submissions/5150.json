Last year she tragically lost her sister who was very young, this was very hard on her and she went on this whole eat, love pray journey. This started with an international trip. Since then she hasn\u2019t stopped. She went on 8 international trips last year. I could only afford to go on one with her, and this is after I complained so she helped me pay.\n\nShe does work from home and also has really great time off. She\u2019s not in debt or anything but I can\u2019t help but think how much she could be saving if she stops. Her argument is that she\u2019s a budget traveler and people spend more a month eating and getting coffee then her trips have cost her. She puts the maximum in her 401k. Plus she thinks it gives her meaning and she loves it. \n\nBut I can\u2019t help to think of our future, that money could be used for a down payment on our future house. Plus I\u2019m not even going so she\u2019s constantly spending time with me. We recently got into an argument and I told her, her traveling is messing with our future. She says I shouldn\u2019t be counting her \u201cpockets\u201d and called me an AH for trying to take away something she loves.\n\nI think one trip us together a year should be enough. She\u2019s been distant lately and from friends I discovered she just booked ANOTHER trip. So AITA?\n\nAlthough I\u2019m already clearly being labeled the AH, I\u2019ll add that her time isn\u2019t technically taking away from us as I do traveling sales within the US, so I\u2019m technically gone during her trips. I think the difference is I\u2019m paid to travel, flights hotel food is free.

Have you discussed these plans other than you criticizing her?", "YTA\n\nYou're counting on HER money to build your future, but it doesn't sound like YOU are saving much for that future either. It doesn't sound like you actually know her travelling budget either \n\nYou sound really incompatible though. She LOVES to travel, you don't and want her to stop travelling. There's going to be resentment brewing, and it sounds like it's coming from you.", "INFO: Do you share finances now? Are you in agreement that buying a house together is one of your future goals? \n\nThis needs to be a serious conversation where you both talk about where you see this relationship going. If your outburst was the first time you ever even talked about this house, it's understandable that she'd be taken aback.", "YTA\n\nshe\u2019s 100% right. She\u2019s spending her money how she wants on something that brings her joy. You literally want her to save it so that if at some point you combine finances you will gain access to he money. It\u2019s NONE of your business.\n\nBesides it sounds like she is saving for retirement and pulling her weight in bills, so I don\u2019t see how this concerns you.", "YTA. Stop thinking of how HER money can benefit YOU. She\u2019s a grown woman. If you can\u2019t handle her traveling the way she loves to then you should leave, not try to stifle that and control her.\n\nETA: after reading your comments you seem more upset that she\u2019s not spending the money the way you want her to, and that she refuses to combine finances with you. Sounds like she\u2019s a smart woman.", "YTA. She doesn't owe you a down payment on a house. Why don't you try saving your money instead of trying to spend hers? I would say this is just a couple with mismatched priorities and N A H, but you go clearly into asshole territory with your possessiveness over her finances and dismissiveness of her loss and attempt to find meaning in something she enjoys doing.", "YTA\n\nAnd a spoilsport\n\nAnd a grump", "Just break up already, AH.", "From your comments, it sounds like you\u2019re talking about moving in together but that her priority is not saving for a down payment. How sure are you that you both have the same long term goals?\n\nI have an extremely flexible job-this has caused conflict in my past relationships because I am able to up and leave whenever I want. For about 8 years, I truly loved traveling and being asked to travel less led to feelings of being stifled. Check in with her and find out if traveling seems to be her priority for the coming year.\n\nI get feeling you\u2019re ready to move in, create a long term future and combine finances. From her, I get a sense that she\u2019s exploring, learning about herself and feeling secure in this chapter of her life. I think you need to talk more to see if you are TRULY walking in the same direction or if you\u2019re living a fantasy where you\u2019re wishing she was behaving differently. \n\nPeople show you what is important to them. Believe them.", "YTA reading that put such a bad taste in my mouth. She\u2019s not in debt, she\u2019s saving for the future, it seems like you\u2019re just jealous and controlling. And the whole \u201cthinks it gives her life meaning\u201d comment was gross and judgmental.", "YTA\n\nIf travel is important to her, you either have to learn to join or to suck it up and let her go on her own. \n\nIf you try to tie her down, you will eventually crash and burn. I mean it may just be grief related, and wanting to do as much as she can while she is young, as her sister did not get to, or it might be she is someone who feels most alive when discovering and exploring. Either way, neither of these are things you get a vote on. \n\nYou don't get to impose your values and your dream of home ownership may not be as important or urgent to her.", "Yup, YTA.  OP should stop trying to claim any right to how someone else spends their money and time.  OP should also realize that he is alienating his GF already.  The latest trip she booked may be her farewell to OP tour.", "\u201cMy girlfriend won\u2019t do what I tell her to with her own money. Am I the AH?\u201d Yes, you are. YTA.", "YTA. She could easily afford 8 trips last year and you couldn't afford one.  Reading between the lines, your GF makes more than you and you're irritated that she isn't saving that excess for you, even though you recognize the therapeutic value to her of these travels.  Instead of talking to her about money, you should be talking about why she feels the constant need to escape from everything, including you.", "YTA a little but its more incompatibility in life. Honestly, I don't fault her for traveling and living her life this way. You two are in a fairly new relationship, you were together only a year when she had this big life change, and it clearly shifted her perspective. Let her travel and do what she needs to do instead of strongarming her into staying with you. You haven't made a serious commitment to each other yet. No finances are combined and she's right. you're counting her pennies on a maybe future. This is what she wants and stopping would make her unhappy. You need to sit with what that means for you and decide your next move accordingly.", "YTA. Are you looking for this woman to pay for things you want in the future because you don't make enough to contribute a fair share? She's not your piggy bank. \n\nIt is HER money, not yours. She works for that and is entitled to spend it on as much trips as she wants. If you keep trying to limit her and control her, you're not going to have a future with her at all.", "YTA \n\nYou definitely shouldn't be counting her pockets. Her money is her money. Why do you think you're entitled to any of it?\n\nWhy should she make her life smaller because you can't afford or don't want to keep up with her travelling?\n\nI 100% agree that she shouldn't have to limit herself because of you. And 8 trips a year isn't even one a month, so she still has lots of free weekends to spend with you. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like you're jealous and instead of being happy for her and supportive of her exploring her hobbies on her own, you're trying to hold her back and using 'but our future' as your reason why. \n\nIf her travelling is making you unhappy, you need to ask yourself why and fix yourself. Don't demand she adjust to make you feel better. \n\nAnd if you can't fix yourself, maybe it's time to realise she isn't the one for you. You don't sound compatible right now. That sucks, but you don't seem happy just now and it's not fair to blame her for that. Own your own happiness.", "YTA\n\nIf your complaint was that she is just physically not there to maintain the relationship because of how much time she spends away, that'd be one thing. But you are definitely an asshole the way you approach this. Its her money, she wants to travel. She is correct in saying that you have no right to count her money.", "YTA. Way to be controlling. Your girlfriend\u2019s travel patterns match my own (and I am married). \n\nAs you could only afford to go on one trip, it\u2019s sounding like you might be jealous. Does she even want the same future as you? Have you discussed this to create joint goals??  If there are joint intentions for a place together, consider asking her to match whoever you can save for a joint down payment on a place together. However, if you are expecting that she NOT travel and save more money than you towards your joint future, I don\u2019t think so.  \n\nIf she\u2019s not in debt from travels, YOU are the controlling one to tell her she can only take 1 trip max a year.", "YTA. Have you put a ring on her finger yet? Then back up you have no say and apparently no money.", "YTA.\nIt\u2019s her money. She gets to decide what to do with it. If you were engaged or married you would have the right to a *conversation* about how the two of you would be combining your finances, and the results of that conversation would have some bearing on the fate of that relationship, but even then you wouldn\u2019t have the right to dictate how she spends her money. It sounds like she enjoys her solo trips, so she\u2019s probably going to keep doing it. If you can\u2019t deal with that, then save the both of you the heartache and end the relationship.", "YTA for your GF essentially deciding she wants to see the world because life is short and you think \"one trip a year with me should be good enough\".\n\nYour guys' interests are likely no longer compatible and that's fine, but don't make the excuse that your presence should be the end all be all of if she goes or not.", "YTA - You've only been together two years and you're already watching and judging her spending her own money. Look at your own situation first before you start judging hers especially if you're only ever able to go on one out of the 8 trips she took. What are you doing with your own money that you can't afford as many trips as she is? It sounds like she's more fiscally responsible than you esp if she's maxing out her retirement, and trip-budgeting smartly, and it's something that brings happiness to her life.", "YTA. You are being extremely controlling. She has told you she's not ready to combine finances or to purchase a home together, you keep pushing but no means no. Her money is hers and hers alone, she's not living beyond her means and has no debt. Get rid of the entitled attitude, count your own money not hers.", "YTA her money, her life, her decision. You aren\u2019t married. There\u2019s no children. Why do you feel she should be funding YOUR future?", "YTA. She\u2019s your girlfriend, not your wife.", "NAH. It just sounds like your priorities aren't compatible.", "YTA\n\nSorry to say that but it seems like your girlfriend is very much okay without you. Also you can't tell her to stay at home. She worked for her own money and she can spend it however she likes it. If she wants to spend it without you that might be a sign to end the relationship.", "YTA. What are you currently doing for your future as a couple bar pissing on her parade?", "Its not your money. Unless you live together and have combined finances, I don't think she'll appreciate you weighing in because its not your money she's spending.\n\nI get a lot out of Me Time. So, its hard to see someone else's perspective as being equally important. Your GF is forging a new identity. She has to figure out who she is now without her sister. And in that regard none of this is about you or where you fit into her life. She's trying to figure out how to be and who she is.\n\n I believe you are entitled to raise all of your concerns. But, don't be surprised if she rejects your suggestions. Its a not a journey you are taking together after all. \n\nNAH. Just people who are trying to figure out what comes next. (If you pressed me on such a matter, I would probably let you go. I can't figure Me out if I don't have the room to do so. And I take for granted that figuring Me out is my right. I get it if you don't want to hang around for that. That would be fine with me.)", "YTA your girlfriend has found something she loves and able to pursue it with finances and her career which is amazing. How about instead of being jealous, be happy for her. If this has helped her heal, who are you to stop it?", "YTA\n\n>  She says I shouldn\u2019t be counting her \u201cpockets\u201d\n\nYeah, p much.", "Yes, YTA. It's not your money. Traveling brings her joy. You just care about yourself. I hope she meets someone wonderful on her next trip and leaves you behind.", " YTA rather than moaning and bitching about your girlfriend living her best life, travelling and doing what she enjoys. Why don\u2019t you focus on your income and earning potential, if your girlfriend is being sensible with pension and savings and travelling isn\u2019t this something you are doing wrong?", "Info, this reads as though you do not live together??", "YTA. She's putting the max in her 401K and still able to afford to do 8 international trips in a year, plus she owns her own home, so clearly she is financial responsible and in a good place so she can do whatever she wants with her money. It's not like she has other financial responsibilities for herself that she isn't meeting. She's meeting ALL of them and then some.\n\n>But I can\u2019t help to think of our future, that money could be used for a down payment on our future house. \n\nSo you're basically just salty that she isn't helping you buy a place. Maybe how about instead of being salty that your gf is in a better place than you financially, you can try to improve yourself/your skills so that you can make more money. That way you can afford to travel and also put money into a home for yourself.", "Yes. Her money. Her trips. YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re being controlling. I hope you don\u2019t mean to be, I\u2019ll go as far as to give you the benefit of the doubt, but seeing the comments should open your eyes if you don\u2019t see it.", "YTA for trying to control how she spends her money. That\u2019s not ok, so stop doing it. However, your concerns are valid, I would share them, and so you have a choice to make, and you\u2019re not TA for that. Stay if you can accept this, and leave if you can\u2019t. That\u2019s how a mature adult handles this properly.", "YTA\n\nThere are far more destructive ways to process grief.  At some point she will run out of places she wants to see.  If you don\u2019t want to wait you can\u2019t hold that against her.  Move on.  Guilt tripping her is only gonna make you a much bigger AH.", "YTA. It\u2019s her money and her time, she can do what she wants with it. It may be worth having a conversation about expectations if you get married or stay together long term. If you want to combine finances and she doesn\u2019t so she can still travel, or if you expect to only travel together it will be a major problem. \n\nYou need to have those conversations asap about how you see your future together. If your plans and expectations don\u2019t align then you need to break up. But you don\u2019t get to unilaterally decide how she uses her own resources.", "YTA - You aren't even engaged and you're trying to control her money. She lost her sister in a shocking, tragic way. It's great that she is finding healing through traveling and seeing the world. Rather than support her in that, you are whining and trying to guilt her so that you can benefit from her money in the future. It's not a good look.", "You\u2019re not married. It isn\u2019t your money. If traveling is a huge priority for her, and you don\u2019t prioritize that, you could be a bad fit. \nYTA, for all those reasons but mostly because you\u2019re trying to control her money when it\u2019s her money, not yours.  If you\u2019re worried about your financial future, make and/or save more money, but don\u2019t piss on your girlfriend\u2019s parade about it.", "YTA You're an entitled, selfish, controlling asshole. She maxes out her 401k, and you've given us no reason to think she's irresponsible with her money.\n\nYou seem jealous. But it also seems like you think she should just sacrifice what she's passionate about to fund your future together. So, what are you sacrificing? Do you eat out, spend money on unnecessary things, or are you saving every single penny for the future?", "YTA. I get you want a future with her but she went through a life change that made something shift. It\u2019s no fault to you or her but she found healing in traveling. It\u2019s something that she loves and can afford. INFO: Have you tried to sit with her and have an open discussion or did you just jump straight to telling her she should cut back on her travels? Maybe she\u2019s saving money toward your future and hasn\u2019t mentioned it yet. Communication is everything.", "YTA as you've said she manages her money well, this is just you being controlling to be honest and also her money is her money, it's not to be used on a down-payment on a house when you guys aren't even living together yet, you've only been together 2 years and plus she literally just lost her sister, like a year is nothing in terms of grief", "Oh honey, I think you and her are just on separate paths. Its reasonable to want a gf that is around and wants to travel with you- and she is perfectly reasonable to do as she wants. NAH", "YTA. It sounds like she can afford to travel and it gives her life meaning. It sounds like you can\u2019t afford to travel and resent seeing what you consider your future money slipping away. You haven\u2019t really been together long enough to be making any decisions about her money.", "YTA let her be her own person and do what she loves, since it's her money. You just sound jealous.", "YTA She needs to find a better partner. That would be the best thing for her future", "I wonder if you have really talked with your girlfriend about her newfound love/need of travel. The way you describe \u201cthis whole eat, love pray journey\u201d makes me wonder if you\u2019re minimizing her feelings after her sister died. \n\nIf you actually are hearing what she\u2019s saying, it sounds like you both have different priorities right now. If you don\u2019t honor that, you\u2019ll both regret it.

You have different priorities and you really can't decide what she should be spending her money on. You want a down payment for a house. Does she even want to buy a house together with you? And you seem to have a problem with her traveling solo. OP, I've been married nearly 30 years and I've taken many international trips without my husband and he doesn't have an issue with that.

Last year she tragically lost her sister who was very young, this was very hard on her and she went on this whole eat, love pray journey. This started with an international trip. Since then she hasn\u2019t stopped. She went on 8 international trips last year. I could only afford to go on one with her, and this is after I complained so she helped me pay.\n\nShe does work from home and also has really great time off. She\u2019s not in debt or anything but I can\u2019t help but think how much she could be saving if she stops. Her argument is that she\u2019s a budget traveler and people spend more a month eating and getting coffee then her trips have cost her. She puts the maximum in her 401k. Plus she thinks it gives her meaning and she loves it. \n\nBut I can\u2019t help to think of our future, that money could be used for a down payment on our future house.

It\u2019s likely time to sit down and figure out what you both want and need from each other in the long term. If it doesn\u2019t line up, it\u2019s likely time to throw in the towel and move on.", "YTA.  Your practicality is coming across as selfish and controlling.  You are trying to extinguish her joy.  Save yourselves years of arguing and break up.  You are on different paths and have different dreams. Time to acknowledge it now.", "Yta", "YTA. Yes, you are the AH, because your gf is still grieving, and you spoke too soon. Her sister just died last year! You\u2019ve only been dating two years, aren\u2019t engaged, and haven\u2019t combined finances. Your gf is not in debt, is putting money into her 401K, and most importantly, is doing what she needs to do in order to grieve. People don\u2019t magically finish grieving after one year. That is a myth. If you want to be with this woman, you need to give her space to grieve. If you two get more serious in your relationship, then you need to have another discussion about finances, expectations, etc for marriage. But it is too soon right now.", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s not in debt, she\u2019s maxing out her 401k, and she loves to travel.   \n\nAt this stage in your relationship you don\u2019t have any right to tell her how she should spend her money.  It might be ok for you to offer advice if she were putting herself into financial jeopardy, but she\u2019s not.  Mostly you seem concerned that she\u2019s not giving up something she loves in order to someday gift that money to you for a down payment on a house. \n\nAlso if she loves to travel and you do not, then you may not be compatible as life partners.", "YTA", "YTA. \n\nShe gets to live her life and process her grief how she wants. \n\nHonestly. It doesn\u2019t even matter she lost her sister. She is allowed to travel because she wants to. She\u2019s responsible with her money (and even if she wasn\u2019t - again, her life, she\u2019s not asking you for help) and gets to spend it how she wants. \n\nStop trying to hold her back. \n\nWill not be surprised at an update in the new year when you\u2019re single.\n\nShe\u2019s living the life she wants.\n\nEdit: read your \u201cupdate\u201d. So really. The big issue is, you\u2019re just not ok with her spending her money on travelling. You\u2019re fine with travelling - as long as someone else is paying for it. Like your job. Or her. When you whined to get her to pay for you to join her. \n\nMake your own damn money and worry about your own future finances on your own. \n\nI hope she sees this.", "As evidenced by the fact that her sister is dead, there is no guarantee of tomorrow. She might drop dead of an aneurysm on her way to her car after lunch, or any other tragic accident. You aren\u2019t on the same financial page as her, so you want her to give up living for today to subsidize your future. Yeah, YTA buddy. Stop trying to stop her from actually living her life. We all might die tomorrow.", "So, you want her to pay for you to go on one trip a year with her and that's it? That should be good enough? She's 28 years old and apparently financially stable enough that she can do 8 trips a year and put the maximum into her 401k without financially burdening herself but you think that you should be able to dictate how she spends her money? She's young. She's taking the opportunity to travel and enjoy life while also saving for her future.   \n\n\nIt sounds like the two of you are in different places in life. It doesn't sound like she wants to give up traveling, and I don't blame her, as the only reason to do so would be to make you happy at her expense.  You would both likely be better off if you went your seperate ways and found people to spend your lives with that are more compatible with what you want in life. She would probably be better off either single for a while or with someone that is okay with her trips or able to afford to go on more of them with her. You would be better off with someone that is content with remaining local and whose focus is on their relationship with you and planning your future together.  \n\n\nYTA for how you approached it. Relationships are compromise. You don't get to decide how she spends her money and you don't get to decide what is \"good enough\" for her. You could've had a conversation and maybe came to some kind of agreement or understanding but instead you went all or nothing and she, rightfully, didn't respond well.", "IF she doesn\u2019t dump you, which I suspect she will, and you prevent her from traveling now, she will resent you every day of your marriage. She clearly has a desire to explore and see the world and you want to control her so that she will buy you a house and then be stuck in it forever staring at your unadventurous face forever. YTA. LET THAT BIRDY FLY OP. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t meant to be.", "NAH currently but YTA if you two continue this relationship as it stands and here's why:\n\nCurrently there are NAH because you two just have different priorities and that is okay. Travel is important. Traveling when you are young and have the means without obligations is freeing. Travel brings a lot of positive growth to an individuals life. Some people will want to Travel indefinitely and some want to get it out of their system before they settle down in a few years and some will never stop but will change the Travel plans to accommodate their ever changing life. There is nothing wrong with any of that.\n\nThere is also nothing wrong with not wanting to prioritize Travel. Some people want the white picket fence, nuclear family, with Fido in the backyard and one vacation a year. That's also a totally valid life goal.\n\n\nHowever, (and this applies to both of you) YWBTA if you two can't come to an agreement on what you want from your lives separate and together. YWBTA if you give ultimatum, and refuse to respect one another's dreams. \n\nAs it stands, you two seem to be on separate pages and that's fine. That's a NAH thing, sometimes relationships just fizzle due to incompatible life aspirations. It's sucky but it happens. I think you two need to really have a discussion on where you both see yourselves in 5 years and if it's not remotely similar, it may be time to have an amicable split so you both can find happiness in life without giving up essential parts to your dream futures.\n\nYTA for being obsessed with how she spends her money though. Good on her for contributing to 401k and still traveling!", "YTA why would she help you with a down payment on your house as a girlfriend? Propose and then maybe, just maybe, you can talk about that. \n\nSounds like she\u2019s being responsible and not going into debt.", "YTA - She\u2019s traveling with her money not yours. What business is it of yours what she does with what she earns? You\u2019re not engaged or married so there is no commitment there to join finances. Save for your own down payment. She is only responsible for herself.", "YTA\n\nYou say that she's \"not in debt or anything\" and that \"she puts the maximum in her 401k\" and that traveling \"gives her meaning and she loves it\" and that she \"does work from home and also has really great time off\". If this is true, then I say good for your girlfriend. \n\nIf you want to buy a home, then I think that you shouldn't count on your girlfriend contributing anything to the down payment. And if this is something that is important to you - only going on one trip together a year, and jointly saving up to buy a house - then I think that you should break up with your girlfriend, because it sounds like you two have different goals and values.", "YTA.", "YTA. So you're worried about her money when it's not both of your money and you're trying to control where she goes and what she does. I hope she's seeing these things for what they are and glimpsing how unpleasant a future with you would be.", "YTA: you could also save for a house. I\u2019m sure if you had discussed it she could set aside money. If she\u2019s not in debt then I\u2019m not sure what the problem is? Honestly sounds like you\u2019re jealous", "YTA. Let her live her best life.", "YTA, especially with your added comment. Really, you travel with payed expenses so you think that is ok, but your girlfriend, that goes on trip on HER time off with HER money isn't? \n\nPlus, greif takes alot of time, let her process her own way. She doesn't own you anything.", "Yta\n\nIf you're more concerned with her \"financial future\" and not time spent with her, then you have no grounds to be concerned. Her finances are not for you to gatekeep and it sounds like she is actually being smart, because she is still saving and putting towards retirement. The more you push this as an issue, the more you will push her away. Stop trying to control how she chooses to live her own life, it doesn't concern you from what you have said, so why do you care?", "i'd be in heaven if i could travel like her. alas, it's another couple years away. \n\nYTA. you're not married to her. her bills are paid, and she's found something meaningful out of tragedy. she's right, you need to stop counting her money.", "YTA its her money and its her perogative to go and enjoy herself before settling down if she even wants to! If your not happy you know where the door is. If you both aren't on the same page about the future then maybe your not right for each other. Also she's still grieving and needs time.", "I think you figured it out dude. You have no future with her. She clearly does t need your money, when she\u2019s ready to settle down she will. You need not apply. She is dealing with her grief. It may mean the end of this relationship and she may even regret it one day. Set her free. If she comes back great, if not she needed to be a free bird. \n\nGentle Yta. You know it\u2019s over.", "YTA.\n\nAnother commenter mentioned making her world smaller. That's exactly what you're trying to do. Find someone who fits what you think your girlfriend should be. Don't make someone who's making the best of her time on this earth fit in your box. Might as well shackle her.", "Ugh, YTA you sound like a gold digger. After reading your comments it's obvious that she a) makes more money than you and b) you resent her for not spending it the way you want (not in your favor). \nShe's right. Stop counting her pockets and as an accountant she knows what she can afford \n\nyou're not even living together and yet you act as if you're married. She was even honest with you and said 2 years isn't enough for her. Respect that or if you can't, move on", "Lol. Wait. Lemme get this straight. You think she's an AH because she travels (and thus doesn't spend time with you), but you are actually traveling whole she's gone? YTA.\n\nBut also, if you want your relationship to survive, you're going to have to work on yourself. I love travel. My husband hates travel. He is cool with me traveling all over (usually with my mom), and then he and I take short trips together. He has hobbies. I have hobbies. It works well.\n\nIf you are upset with her traveling, then you need to dump her and move on. It would be unfair to force her to stop doing something that she loves. If you force her to stop, YTA.\n\nShe's seizing the day. Let her.", "Still a YTA with the edit.", "YTA. It\u2019s her money, she gets to decide what to do with it. You two are not married (not even engaged) so you have absolutely no say in how she spends her money.", "YTA!", "YTA. \u201cShe booked another trip\u201d. I think you have your answer", "YTA", "YTA. It's her life, her money it makes her happy and it does not affect you or her negatively, especially if you say you're usually away for the duration of her trips anyway. As someone already said, she does not owe you her money either, and if that's the way she wants to spend her money, that's perfectly fine and if it bothers you so much, you're either very selfish bc you don't like that she's spending in a way from which you don't gain anything, or if you see it as an unnecessary expanse you're just very different and clearly don't care that it makes her happy. She's grieving, lost someone way too young and now tries to reframe life by seeing the world. It sounds like you don't want her to be happy if it's not on your terms, which is extremely controlling and not okay or healthy behaviour at all.", "YTA. She can afford to go. She wants to go. She\u2019s a grown ass adult. She doesn\u2019t owe you money for a down payment on a house sometime in the future. Save for your own damn house.

She fully finds her retirement, she\u2019s being smart about it. 20s is when you should travel. I\u2019m in my 40s and it gets so much harder with age, at least for me. You don\u2019t sound compatible", "So her time away isn't taking away from the two of you spending time together, you just don't like how she's choosing to spend her own money?

You think it doesnt give her meaning, so you're fucking disregarding what she is SAYING TO YOUR FACE because it doesn't jibe.\n\nI get not wanting your SO to be away, but you're just looking at the money she's spending and thinking she's jilting you - that if she weren't so selfish you could benefit from that cash. You're truly disgusting dude.", "Oh, lol. You don't have girlfriend any more. You just don't know it yet. Maybe even she doesn't know it, but she sounds like very smart lady, she will know soon enough. Yta", "YTA. She\u2019s grieving the loss of her sister & finding solace in traveling. She\u2019s not ignoring her financial obligations. It\u2019s none of your business what she spends her money on. She\u2019s not your fianc\u00e9e, either.", "Seeing as how you're literally gone while she's traveling, I think what this is really about is that you're jealous that she's spending the money on herself and not on you. You wouldn't be whining so much if you got to go on these trips too. Use your own money and stop trying to mooch off hers. YTA", "I think the problem here is that you are incompatible now as a couple.", "I'm a bit confused. Is it time together or money you're focused on? If you have a travelling job and she does her own trips while you're away I don't see the issue. Why is your travelling different, because it's in the USA still or because it's paid for? You do sound a bit jealous she has the freedom to go where she wants with less hassle. \n\nShe owns her own home, is debt free and is saving for the future (I don't know what a 401k is but sounds like a pension fund or something?). She doesn't see the relationship having progressed to the point of combining anything and isn't looking to move in yet. Is this the main issue? Being in different stages and viewing relationships differently can hurt but it does sound she's been honest with you on where she is. If you're looking for a bigger commitment, I don't think you're current method of annoying her over the same issue is going to fix it.\n\nI'm saying yta because you're focusing so much on what her money could do for you. Maybe it's just the phrasing but that's how it comes across especially when you mention you complained until she helped pay for you to go on a trip.", "I\u2019m a lot like your girlfriend - travel is a huge hobby and exploring new countries and cultures feeds my soul. If you guys aren\u2019t married and combining finances, you get literally no say over how she spends her money. And just because you\u2019re dating doesn\u2019t mean she has to give up hobbies she loves and her own life outside of your relationship. My bestie is engaged and we just went to Vegas without her fianc\u00e9 and we had a blast. Stop being so controlling. It\u2019s creepy. I wish I could tell your girlfriend to travel even more.\n\nObviously YTA", "YTA. My vote may have been different if you talked about how it felt for you to be away from her so often or that you\u2019re growing apart but it\u2019s literally just about the money. You aren\u2019t even engaged. Not to belittle other relationships, but at two years of dating, you are not owed a future built on her money.

Pay your own way.", "YTA - I would be sympathetic if you said her spending so much time away was affecting your relationship. You are seriously upset that she is spending HER money on things she likes to do? If you both want to live together and plan a future together, it should be done together (both of you in agreement). Maybe you could both agree to open a joint savings account/CD/stock/etc, and contribute an amount proportional to your income to start saving for a house. You both should have the freedom to spend your money how you see fit.", "Dude, you're spending her money...no adult likes that.
