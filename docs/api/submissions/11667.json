Chicken the food and chicken the animal are one and the same. 9 is really old to not know this fact if she didn't. Also \"traumatized\" is such a silly word for the parents to use. She loved those chickens and is sad they are dead and is grieving on some level because death is probably a new concept to her, but that isn't trauma. Maybe this is an important moment for her and she will decide on vegetarianism or only want to eat ethically raised chickens. maybe she won't care after the initial shock. Life is full of learning new things and making new decisions, the best thing to do is be truthful but no hurtful, and help her discover what morals she wants to stick to.", "NTA, I was actually traumatized in a similar way as a child.

Factory farming is the norm, and meat from animals that *were* treated well can be exorbitantly expensive.
