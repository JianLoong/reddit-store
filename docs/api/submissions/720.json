It\u2019s a skill, not something you\u2019re born with. Personally I\u2019d think through some options about how you could have reacted in a way that would make you happier (forget his feelings). If you want to share that with him, something like \u2014 when you said (x) I felt (y) and because of (a, b, c) I reacted like (z), but what I really wish I\u2019d said was (d), then ask him what he thinks of that.

It's unfortunately common for adults to see kids/teens as something their parents have to deal with instead of human beings with emotions and needs all of their own.

Having a couple of drinks also isn't something you did to your mom, it's something you decided to do to celebrate.

WAS OP cleared to drink? Had OP\u2019s mom asked her not to drink? Reminded her of what the doctor said about no alcohol? Etc.

You had the cancer but your mother watched her \u2018baby\u2019 have cancer.

And as a mom, I put on a good face while my mind goes to every nightmare scenario when my children or husband have health problems. \n\nYour cancer was not a competition on who had it worse -you or your mom. It was a hell you both endured.

Lymphoma survivor here\u2026 drinking after chemo really depends on your body and how your exams come back. Every body and dr is different and I promise you she wouldn\u2019t be drinking if it wasn\u2019t cleared by her doctor.\n\nThat being said, yes its hard on families but she just went thorough hell\u2026 I promise you that the difference between her experience and her mom\u2019s are WAY different ( and i say this as a cancer survivor and as a person that had to go through it on the family side with my father). She wanted to decompress and celebrate, she has EVERY right to lash out for that uncalled comment. \n\nAnd I can tell you that she KNOWS her mom also went through a lot but both things cannot be compared. \n\nShe is NTA.", "Because, as I said, if OP\u2019s mom had told her several times she was under strict instructions not to drink because of her chemo and OP ignored her mom, possibly risking mom having to call EMS or rush her to the hospital, she was being an AH and frankly deserved to be called out, though not in the way her uncle did it. If uncle flew off the handle unprovoked, that\u2019s a whole different ball game. I don\u2019t understand what you don\u2019t get about the difference in the situation. If OP\u2019s mom and uncle just don\u2019t like drinking, that\u2019s one thing, but if OP is violating medical advice and putting herself at risk people in her life have the right to call her out.\n\nAnd I\u2019m so keen on if OP was ignoring the whole \u201cdon\u2019t drink after chemo\u201d advice because depending on the chemo, putting alcohol in your system before your body\u2019s cleared the drugs is an almost sure fire way to make yourself sick in a vast array of spectacular ways, anything from mild alcohol poisoning to freaking liver failure, which very way may have been why her uncle flipped out at her in the first place."]}
