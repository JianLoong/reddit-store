I work hybrid full time and my bf works part time from home so he is at home everyday whole day. \n\nHe usually stays up at night and sleep just before I go to work, so I always wake up to a messy living room and kitchen. I am also the one who cooks, cleans, launders the clothes and goes grocery shopping.  \n\nI only realized that I am doing everything a few weeks ago. I have talked to him about this issue a lot as I am starting to feel really tired but he always says that he helps me enough and that I should stop complaining.\n\nSo, three weeks ago, I decided to stop doing everything completely. I stopped cooking, going to buy groceries, maintaining/cleaning the house. I only cook for myself dinner and do my own dishes and laundry but nothing else. I wanted to see if my bf was going to realize and step up.\n\nIn the course of three weeks, no one has been going to buy groceries, so I have been eating the only thing we have at home which is pasta. No one has cleaned the house once, and a pile of dirty laundry (his) has formed.

My bf has been complaining a bit that I haven\u2019t been cooking for him but I told him I was too busy with work (which is true). He has been mostly ordering food everyday but has been skipping meals a lot has there is barely any food at home, he has been losing weight (and he is already pretty skinny). \n\nThe state of our house is degrading and I honestly feel disgust living here, but I am done doing everything by myself. I realize that this is really petty. I have told this to a few of my friends and while they are acknowledging the fact that I shouldn\u2019t do everything at home, they are saying I am wrong in not cleaning a bit or buying some fresh food. As I said, the state of the house is degrading and mold is forming, and my friends are saying I can\u2019t just not do anything about this and I should at least make sure we live in a hygienic place.

My MIL says guys are pigs but I refuse to just believe that gender dictates cleanliness.", "NTA but this isn't sustainable.", "NTA. It sounds like you have the worst roommate of all time. If he isn\u2019t contributing around the place, why even live with him? Talk to him about chores/responsibilities and if he doesn\u2019t contribute, you\u2019d probably be better off solo.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2019re his girlfriend, not his mother. He has gotten used to being looked after and I\u2019m sorry to say, you enabled that mentality.\nHe either realised that a relationship is about give and take for both parties and he can\u2019t understand that, perhaps find yourself a man who actually respects you.", "NTA\nWhere do you see this relationship going? Because I wouldn't want to spend my life with somebody who can't take care of himself though he is physically able.", "NTA. Also you're not compatible.  He's working a part-time job outside of interviewing for a full-time job he should be contributing at minimum equally to the household. The fact that he's lamenting that you haven't made him dinner after not making you dinner once or even picking up after himself shows his expectation of you going forward. If you had a sit down with him and talk to him about it he may change for a few weeks but ultimately this is who he is. Unless I'm missing what he is contributing to your relationship, I think you need to move on.", "Nta- he needs to step up. This isn\u2019t sustainable though. At some point you may have to decide what happens next. He isn\u2019t \u2018helping\u2019 when it\u2019s his own home! he should be cleaning anyway. It\u2019a not your responsibility to clean and him to do you a favour and help occasionally! \n\nIf he refuses to clean (either laziness or sexism, not sure which), then at some point you\u2019ll have to decide whether you want to do all the cleaning, live in a gross place or leave the relationship. I hope he steps up, but might be a good idea to think about what you\u2019d do next if he doesn\u2019t.", "NTA. I see a lot of posts where the male SO doesn't help out wither it's cleaning or childcare. A lot of men seem to want a mother rather then a partner. It's crazy really. I thought we were getting past the whole gender role thing.\n\nMy husband cooks pretty much all of our meals and keeps the kitchen mostly clean. I'll help out some but the kitchen is his domain but he loves to cook. I kind of hate cooking and my skills are far below his. I do most of the laundry but he'll help me put it away. He'll also clean part of the bathroom like the toilet since I hate doing it, then I'll clean the rest. While I wouldn't consider either of us the most cleanest, we do well enough together. The point is that it's always been a joint effort for entire 16 years we've been together. While  thing have fluctuated over the years, this is how things have been the last few. But I'm also the breadwinner so it was kind of the deal that he keeps me fed. \n\nI never wanted to be a 'house wife' and so far that has stuck. I don't think I would have stuck around with a guy that expected me to do all the household chores and cooking. Although he'd have to be okay with box Mac and cheese, sandwiches or burnt food if that was the case. But I can't say for sure since I never dated anyone else. I just got lucky for someone compatible the first time around. \n\nI probably would have done the same thing your currently doing. I think you need to have a long chat about your living expectations and of he can't meet that then maybe he can at least hire a cleaning service to keep up his half. But if you want kids with this guy later on, I be very worried about ending up being the sole care provider. Again you definitely need to talk it out now rather then down the road because these sorts of proplem don't tend to fix themselves.", "Definitely NTA. Sounds like unequal contributions are being made to the household. You both are working and labor should not fall solely on you. A conversation is definitely needed.", "NTA and perhaps you need to move out for a while so that you can both think about the relationship and where it is going", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend sounds incredibly lazy. When he says he helps you enough what is he actually doing?\n\nYou either need to talk to him again and get him to actually step up and help you out with the household chores or you need to rethink this relationship.", "NTA. You don't have a boyfriend you have a toddler. Is that what you signed up for? He either grows Up or you Take him out with the trash. If not, you will be TA to yourself", "Sounds like a healthy long term relationship... You need to talk to each other. He also needs to step up and not be an ass. \n\nNTA", "NTA better to discuss issues like this early on and see if it changes.", "NTA. Good on you for pushing back. Now you've realised that you're living with someone who is apparently incapable of behaving like an adult, is there a reason you're still with him?", "NTA but you're going to have to have a direct conversation about this with him. And if he doesn't start contributing you will have to make a decision if you don't want to be resentful the rest of your life. Either accept that you are going to be the main person doing all the chores for the duration of the relationship or end the relationship.", "NTA\n\nWhat a pig. Do you really see a future with this man? I wouldn\u2019t want to live with someone like him.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely not a matter of gender. My ex husband was obsessed with cleanliness and kept our apartment very clean and tidy. My current partner does as much housework as me without me telling him what to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Instead of saying you\u2019re not cooking or whatever because you\u2019re busy at work, you should tell him the truth, that you\u2019re not his mother or his servant, & you\u2019re done.  I think you\u2019re best off, depending on your lease, to just break up & move out. FYI, you could have known he was an AH when he said that doing chores was \u201chelping\u201d you. That alone said that he saw cooking & cleaning as your job, not his, & that anything he did was a favor to you.", "NTA. He has to have noticed the state the house is in. If he hasn\u2019t stepped up at this point, he never will. He clearly doesn\u2019t mind living in a messy, food-less house, and even worse- he doesn\u2019t mind you feeling overworked and taken advantage of.

I would cut your losses now and find a true partner.", "ESH you are right in that you shouldn\u2019t have to do all the chores. And there should probably be a much more fair division of labor since you seem to be contributing more things to the household  like working full time, shopping, etc. I think its arguable that your boyfriend should be doing the most of the household chores. \n\nThat said this is toxic tit for tat kind of passive aggressive behavior that isn\u2019t good. I know this kind of thing works on TV, but its just going to build resentment and on the path to that resentment you\u2019re going to be living in a pig stye. You need to sit down with your boyfriend and tell him that you need to both be doing chores. If he can\u2019t do this then breakup with him. Your his girlfriend not his mom. You should be partners.  Do you see a future with a man that can\u2019t be bothered to do basic household chores or go grocery shopping?", "ESH. \n\nLike you did the right thing from the word go and talked to him about it and it sounds like he dismissed it and honestly telling you to stop complaining is shitty of him. \n\nBut it ultimately seems like not doing what you usually would hasn't given this \"ah-ha\" moment I think you had expected. \n\nI would say you need to talk to him again.

You then proved your point by completely stopping everything. Good for you!\n\n(I personally would keep it up until he said something to see what reaction is - does he even see the mess, will he actually clean something on his own without instructions or will he pick a fight with you. It would be very telling on how he sees you.)\n\nThink about what you want in a partner and what your ideal balanced relationship looks like. For some it\u2019s 50/50 chores, switching weekly assignments or it\u2019s dedicated tasks or skills depending on where you excel. Tell him so it\u2019s more of a talk around \u201cthis is what I need and am looking for in a partner\u201d so he hopefully sees this is just more than cleaning and how to function as a team. \n\nThose things typically should happen before you move in with someone to gauge compatibility but I understand love probably swept over and it was just exciting in general.", "NTA. Drop his weaponized incompetence perpetuating ass ASAP", "NTA. But this isn't going to improve.

Gave him a couple of things to do everyday and stuck it on the fridge. It worked.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA but I will tell you this now, division of house chores is not a petty thing to end a relationship over. This is something that will never go away your entire lives. If he's willing to let mold grow he either urgently needs treatment for depression or he is so far removed from the idea he's equally responsible that he won't change. \n\nIf you have reason to think (or know) that he has depression, then its possible for him to change and improve and only you can decide if you want to wait for and support that change (and there is no shame if you don't). \n\nOtherwise you are committing to unequal household labour forever if you stay.
