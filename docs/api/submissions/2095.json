He\u2019s in customer service and works from home. She works an office job. I see that they keep a small brush to scrub their nails, but they\u2019re still always dirty. They both allow their nails to get pretty long and don\u2019t seem to prioritize hygiene the way my husband and I do.\n\nThey could wash their hands, but my observation has been that they don\u2019t wash as often as is needed to be safe. \n\nI believe a minimum hand washing would look like this. Wash hands>prepare raw food> wash hands> cook food> wash hands> use clean hands to arrange food for service. \n\nThey for sure skip the first hand washing which is absolutely disgusting to me.", "That\u2019s my husband\u2019s thought too. I came from a family that puts tons of effort into hosting meals. I have a menu planned, each dish has a place in the China set I\u2019ve chosen and it is a top priority to have beautiful, piping hot food served to my guests. \nI simply do not want their lukewarm, mismatched side dish.

It\u2019s disgusting!", "I was on your side until you laughed at her.\n\nIt\u2019s totally reasonable that you don\u2019t want them to bring anything, but she probably has no idea why you wouldn\u2019t want that. You laughing at her when she\u2019s trying to contribute to a family meal is straight up mean.\nYou should have just said \u201cwe\u2019ve actually already planned out the whole meal, but what would be super helpful would be if you brought a bottle of wine you like.\u201d If she still shows up with a side, just don\u2019t eat it or push it around your plate.\n\nNAH", "NTA... this is where you say \"oh I forgot napkins and drinks. could you pick those up for me?\"", "Eeeeeeewwwww NOOOOO!
