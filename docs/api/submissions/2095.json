He\u2019s in customer service and works from home. She works an office job. I see that they keep a small brush to scrub their nails, but they\u2019re still always dirty. They both allow their nails to get pretty long and don\u2019t seem to prioritize hygiene the way my husband and I do.\n\nThey could wash their hands, but my observation has been that they don\u2019t wash as often as is needed to be safe. \n\nI believe a minimum hand washing would look like this. Wash hands>prepare raw food> wash hands> cook food> wash hands> use clean hands to arrange food for service. \n\nThey for sure skip the first hand washing which is absolutely disgusting to me.", "That\u2019s my husband\u2019s thought too. I came from a family that puts tons of effort into hosting meals. I have a menu planned, each dish has a place in the China set I\u2019ve chosen and it is a top priority to have beautiful, piping hot food served to my guests. \nI simply do not want their lukewarm, mismatched side dish. Also, my SIL loudly points it out when I don\u2019t eat her food. Their family always takes a \u201cno thank you\u201d serving to be polite so it\u2019s noticeable when I skip."]}
