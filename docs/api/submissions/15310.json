I moved her to the loft room because he didn't like stairs, and he started putting things in the stairway. She no longer had a room, a space for herself. He kept trying to instigate fights between us. I grabbed all his dirty cups from the fridge, and he tried to blame all those dishes on her. Stuff like that.

Like, which is it? Let children's fleeting emotions and preferences decide everything for the family, or not?  Or, worse, let the children's preferences decide huge decisions like marriage, but not small decisions like where people sleep?\n\nIt really needs to be more of a balance and not so black and white\u2014 everyone's feelings can and should be *included* and heard, but it's not so binary as in either we only have two options: either do what the kids want 100% or what the adults want 100%. \n\nAbsolutely these adults probably should have thought this through a bit more, moved more slowly, talked more with the kids about the adjustment and what it means for them, allow them input and to be heard etc. But to expect that blending a family is always either just obvious and easy or shouldn't be done at all if anyone struggles to adjust is silly and naive. You should expect some conflicts and an adjustment period with a situation like that. The more important thing would be managing the conflicts and adjustment period in a healthy way.", "Blending families in often a bad, selfish idea on the part of the parents.

He whined at one point that he didn't want to sleep with his sibling (twin beds) and we told him that that's where we planned for him to sleep so if he didn't want to then he'd have to come up with an alternative for HIM. And he didn't, he sucked it up and slept in the room.

So, yeah,  them leaving a safe bet. \n\nLet's take the step and non step element out of the equation. One of the girls threw a fit over having to share a bedroom, not permanently, just on vacation. Instead of parenting the child who was causing the problem, you've dumped the other child on the couch. Your reasoning being, the problem child deserves her own space and privacy. The child not causing the problem therefore should suck it up sleeping in a common area with zero privacy.

All of these kids are just that\u2026 kids. They need help learning how to navigate their new situations. And that doesn\u2019t mean catering to one child while another gets slighted. Be a good parent and teach your children how to manage their wants, needs, and emotions to their age-appropriate abilities (and fyi, I would be doing this with my 6 and 7 year olds even) and figure out how to get along, share a room in this case, and still help them find options for alone time if they need it.

But I also knew that THEY hated it TOO. It was hard on all of us, and I didn't take it out on the other kids.
