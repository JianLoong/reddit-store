It's not going to help the family dynamic if he forces the step-daughter to live like she did when she was in poverty. I'd say the entirety of what I think of him, but I can't do it without breaking the rules.\n\nYTA, a bad husband, a bad step-father, and a mean person.", "BuT tHeY'rE uSeD tO iT!", "People go the nuclear option if they see fit. And it is a red flag that op was willing to favor one kids demand over the other kid needs.", "OP should have 1) told his daughter if she didn\u2019t like sharing a space then SHE could relocate and/ or 2) consulted with the wife to come up with an alternative solution.  Perhaps the SIL would have been willing to sleep in a twin and let one of the girls take her room.  Or he and his wife could have moved around if they were in agreement.  There was an opportunity here to teach the daughter she is not household shot-caller as well as to work WITH his wife to help find comfortable solutions to this blended family dilemma.  Given the wife took her family and left the vacation, I have to think this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u2026this was not the first time OP has been so blatantly tone deaf and discriminatory in his treatment of the stepdaughter.", "My wife was homeless before she met me. I figured her daughter would be fine sleeping outside for a couple of nights.", "Me too. \n\nShe\u2019s \u2018less then\u2019, and it\u2019s disgusting reasoning. Another reasoning could be that sd should get the room as she\u2019s not had the same experiences as daughter and deserves the treat. Also way to go \u2018helping the dynamic\u2019 by reminding both girls that one of them is above the other. OP is raising an entitled brat and it\u2019s astounding that to anyone else the only reasoning is if it\u2019s his daughter at fault, then it\u2019s his daughter that faces the consequences. She can have all the space on the couch. ( YTA OP, jeez )", "But she's done it before, she'll be fine!  /s", "He\u2019s a bad father too", "Easy to see why his first marriage failed.  Second one is \u2018t going to make it a year.", "He even says  in the comments that THIS couch was an improvement to the one she was used too...", "The fucking audacity to be like, my daughter is used to her comforts! This little peasant child is used to poverty, she won't mind a couch! That's good enough for her. WTF give this child some dignity and respect and a place of belonging. Thank goodness her mother sees this AH for who he is and is getting out.", "the fact that this came out his mouth is horrible. he belongs in a dog pound cause hes a dog", "I\u2019m sure she would be fine outside. She\u2019s used to it!", "Lol.", "So is this your real account then? Why is there a comment in your history that says your son is 12? Perhaps you\u2019ve lied about quite a bit. Maybe even this whole story lol. Still, if this scenario actually took place, YTA.", "Yep. And classist. He thinks because he's the one with the money (a rental that big would be HELLA expensive) that \"his\" family is more important, and he's raising a spoiled brat that will treat people with less money as lesser than her.", "If it does make it a year, it'll only be because it took that long for her to scrounge up the money \"doing odd jobs for cash\" to leave him. I hope she's able to soon.", "That\u2019s an insult to dogs though haha at least dogs can share and be kind", "Oh dear\u2026", "This. His step-daughter will ultimately be fine in life, but his daughter will be entitled and selfish. How does a person allow a child to \"kick someone out\" of a room? That's a punishable offense and he rewarded her.", "I can disagree, my dog is hella possessive over her things and her space. She likes my older brother dog but she never lest him go in her bed or take her blankets. But she is fine letting him be on her favorite parts of the house and sharing her toys. But sleeping in her bed or even sleeping next to her cage she doesn\u2019t like.", "EXACTLY THIS! \nHe essentially REWARDED his daughter for bullying Stepsister showing that she can do it and not only get away with it but praised. He's teaching her that being a bully is a good thing and he has the AUDACITY to ask if he's TAH like he genuinely doesn't know wtf??"]}
