We used to be the best of friends, but then Hazel moved schools with our mutual friend, Gabe, and we lost touch. I tried contacting her on Instagram when I was in Grade 8, but I never got a reply. Recently though, I thought about her again and decided to ask Gabe if Hazel was still interested in talking to me. Luckily, Gabe gave me Hazel's Instagram, and we started talking again.\r  \n\r  \nWe caught up and planned a group call with Hazel, Gabe, and another friend named Seb. I was really excited to talk to Hazel again, but then I made an inappropriate comment about her appearance during the call planning. I told Gabe that Hazel looked \"hot\" in a recent post, but I didn't mean to objectify her or make her feel uncomfortable. I quickly realized that my comment was inappropriate and could have made Hazel feel disrespected.\r  \n\r  \nUnfortunately, Hazel backed out of the planned call, and I was confused. She accused me of not being mature enough and told me that she was uncomfortable with my behavior. She was upset that I messaged her boyfriend and friend, even though she told me a week before the planned call to stop talking to them. Hazel also didn't like how I called her \"hot\" in front of Gabe, which she found objectifying and disrespectful. She felt like I wasn't respecting her boundaries and was making her feel uncomfortable.\r  \n\r  \nI was surprised and didn't know what to say. I apologized to Hazel, explaining that I didn't mean to upset her and that I just wanted to catch up after years of not seeing her. I also didn't know that Hazel had a boyfriend at the time and meant my comment as a compliment, not objectification. I promised to be more mindful of my behavior in the future.\r  \n\r  \nDespite my apology, Hazel didn't want to talk to me anymore and accused me of not getting the hint. I was confused and didn't know what to do. I waited for a few months before reaching out to Gabe again, hoping to reconcile with Hazel. Gabe explained that Hazel was going through a rough time in her life and suggested that I should try contacting her again, but to be careful not to say anything inappropriate.\r  \n\r  \nI took Gabe's advice and tried contacting Hazel again, but she was still upset and asked me what I wanted from her. I tried to explain that I just wanted to make things right and apologize for my behavior. However, it seemed that Hazel was still not ready to forgive me.\r  \n\r  \nLooking back, I now realize that my behavior made Hazel feel uncomfortable, and I should have respected her wishes and listened to her concerns instead of continuing to contact her. It's important to be mindful of other people's feelings and boundaries, especially when reconnecting with old friends. I hope that one day Hazel can forgive me, but I understand that it may take time. I'm still trying to learn from my mistakes and be a better person.

The comment wasn't even said to her, it was said to another guy who you probably assumed would also say she was hot. It was objectifying. You two used to be friends and she probably thought you were reaching out to her to be friends again. But based on how you talk about her and how desperate you seem to talk to her despite her making it clear she doesn't want to talk to you, it seems you were trying to talk again in hopes of dating or sleeping with her. She's right. You AREN'T getting the hint. She does not want to talk to you. Leave her be. She doesn't wanna be hit on or pursue a friendship. Stop trying to reach her by other people. Just let her be. If she wants to talk to you again she'll reach out to you.", "You got absolutely shredded on the other sub when you posted this yesterday. You\u2019re going to get the same, nearly unanimous response as you did before. YTA and a colossal creep.", "YTA you pushed too far", "Unfortunately, too many guys only want to be \"friends\" with women when they are attracted to them and want to get with them. Hazel hasn't talked to you since you both were very young kids. A lot of time has passed. And the one time you try to reconnect with her, desperately, you immediately objectify her, which makes it very clear you're not interested in her friendship. It's made even worse because she already has a boyfriend. Then you continue to reach out to her. Honestly, you kind of blew it dude. Just leave this girl alone.", "Look at it from her perspective:  A person she hasn\u2019t been in touch since she was 5 years old starts, through friends, trying to reforge a connection over social media.  What could this guy want from her?  She then hears that this person is calling her hot to other folks and wants nothing to do with him.\n\nSounds about right.  Either YTA, or you\u2019re really just awkward AF.  But I can smell the desperation from here.", "YTA \nHazel\u2019s situation was kinda similar to mine that happened a year ago. I had to cut a guy friend out of my life and I told my boyfriend about it cuz I felt so disrespected and uncomfortable after he called me a couple of pet names and said that if I was still single, he would\u2019ve broken up with his girlfriend and marry me via instagram DMs-even tho he knew that I have a bf- you were trying to hit on Hazel by the \u201chot\u201d comment and saying it in front of her bf. You blew it; stop trying to talk to her and her bf, leave her alone, take the L and move on with your life", "You\u2019re NTA. You\u2019re 17 years old and said a girl was hot to another alleged friend who ran off and told her. \n\nMy response will be unpopular but everyone can get off their high horse and stop pretending they don\u2019t tell their friends when they find someone attractive. \n\nYour friend ran off and told her and it got uncomfortable, and now the friendship is weird.\n\n2 things, neither Gabe nor Hazel are assholes either though, but Gabe isn\u2019t someone you should be confiding your feelings in. \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong to have feelings about someone or to confide them to your friend, idk why everyone is acting like that is wrong to do. If you had been speaking to her like that directly and making her uncomfortable that\u2019s one thing, but you\u2019re allowed to express things like you did to your friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
