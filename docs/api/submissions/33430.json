He threw out a whole list of diseases he thought could be in the house from the vermin. Some I hadn\u2019t even heard of before, like hantavirus or leptospirosis. Not going to lie, that spooked me. \n\nI got a knock on my door yesterday from one of the family members. They are requesting help from neighbors to clean up the house this week. I said I was very sorry for what they were dealing with, but I would be unable. I didn\u2019t mention that I wasn\u2019t willing to put my health at risk. The family member pushed back and said they were really struggling, that clean up services were expensive. They had respirators to hand out.

Especially in that situation.\n\nJust \"cleaning\" the area is not going to solve the problem and it will be very expensive.  They need to reach out to the city and get in touch with professionals (cleaners and head-shrinks) to help the hoarder.  Or the house will refill faster than ever.  Of they truely are hoarders, then it is a mental issue that must be properly and professionally addressed.\n\nThey are lucky someone didnt call adult protective services or other associations before now.", "Absolutely NTA - that's disgusting and unhealthy. I cannot even imagine asking someone to go into a home requiring respirators to not get sick.", "nta. this is not on you, and pushing when you first declined was shitty. the time they\u2019re spending trying to guilt the neighbors into free (hazardous) labour would be better spent trying to clean the house imho. stick a plea for help on facebook and get working.", "This is not your problem. The family ignored their hoarder relative up until the point the town got involved. You want to save money by ignoring a problem? You got to pay up when it\u2019s time to actually fix it. They probably have all kinds of liens and fines, and all sorts of legal matters pressing against them for ignoring their relative. Do not feel guilty one bit. As far as I am concerned, your wife already did yawls part by throwing rat poison in the yard.\n\nSTRONG NTA on this one. The hoarders family should have done some thing when they first realized there was a problem. This kind of shit does not happen out of nowhere. It is a slow climb that everybody witnesses. It is laughable they came to your door.", "NTA that would be a big no thanks from me as well. Also, you're already helping by disposing of the stray rats.", "NTA\n\nMy ex was/is a hoarder.  When I finally escaped, it took less than a year for the house to be full and he was evicted.  We all went to help the landlord clean it up, 9 full big roll-off dumpsters were filled.  His sisters got him into a small apartment, and he filled it up, when the apartment saw they also evicted him.  I think my son went and helped clean it up then too.  He is now living in his car.  It's unfortunate but he did it all to himself.  None of our children will help him due to past abuse, his sisters will not help him because he started verbally abusing them.  I don't know what he is doing, I told him where he could go to get social services, but he made excuses and said his sisters did everything that caused his homelessness, they didn't.  \n\nI know it has nothing to do with your neighbor, but thanks for listening to my little bit of experience with a hoarder.  \n\n If anyone has a suggestion on what I can help my youngest son buy for his father for Christmas, tips appreciated.  I was thinking some canned food with the pop tops and things like that. \n\nDon't expose yourself to the filth in that home.  It was terrible when I helped my ex.", "NTA - I understand that yes Hoarding is a mental illness but it's their mess to get out of on their own. Not the responsibility of the neighbors to help due to the costs.", "NTA - you are under no obligation to risk your own health for your neighbor. Also, I would be hesitant to go into this situation with the family. Services to clean hoarder houses are expensive for a reason: there is a lot of liability involved on either side. The work can be dangerous and you could get pulled into family issues or accused of trying to steal, etc. Community mental health services and adult protective services, or the Council on Aging may have ideas about how the family can get assistance for the clean out.", "NTA you don\u2019t just wake up and see the \u201cmess.\u201d This is things that has been building up for years and years, and they chose to do nothing until it couldn\u2019t be ignored any longer. \n\nIt is completely unacceptable for them to put others at risk for them failing at keeping up with the issue. I doubt they are not aware of the kind of diseases and health concerns that could potentially be in that house. The fact that they are not paying for professionals to do this right is unhinged, and completely irresponsible. \n\nLook OP you\u2019re not in the wrong for saying no, which the family member should\u2019ve accepted and not force it. I also don\u2019t think any neighbors should put their life at risk by going into that home, especially if they have kids or auto immune compromise family members in their lives. Imagine the things that they could be taking back to their household, honestly I hate being a stick in the mud, but I think you should be reporting this, either somebody condemn the house or they get actual professionals who knows what they are doing and can do it safely.", "NTA. absolutely do not help them. This opens the door to can you do this or that. You\u2019re so close and we live an hour away. Next thing you\u2019ll be asked to take them to their dr appointments. Do not help. Not only that but gross. They can pull more family together to help. Keep your distance.", "NTA. It is a mental illness, but it's still their fault.\n\nYou likely will be much better off if they lose the house. The likelihood that they will revert to hoarding is extremely high.", "NTA It\u2019s an unfortunate situation, but not yours to deal with any more than you have already.", "NTA.  They need a professional cleaning service, expensive as they are.  Those diseases are nothing to mess around with, and the pros know how to handle things.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don\u2019t have any obligation to help, but the disease risk makes your reluctance to help even more understandable. You don\u2019t owe an explanation, although my people-pleaser ass would have told them I\u2019m worried about disease.", "NTA.  It's unfortunate that they let the situation get that bad, but no one should be going door to door asking for help to clean up a hazmat situation.  There's a reason the cleanup service is expensive - it's called personal protective equipment and boatloads of insurance.", "NTA at all, hoarders are the worst.  I had a neighbor that used his yard as a car junkyard while I was growing up.  Finally the city sued him and had all the vehicles towed to a recycling center and then billed the owner.  You're smart to stay away because of the diseases.", "NTA\n\nHoarding is a mental disease and, if not solved or kept under control, it's useless to clean the house. In a few days they will be hoarding again. This is their main problem and must seek help.\n\nAbout the cleaning session, I understan you feel empathic to a person who is struggling, but in that house could be anything, from mold to pest escrements.", "NTA. It would have been a nice gesture to give a hand if you felt like it, but you ABSOLUTELY don't owe it and should not force yourself if you don't feel comfortable doing so.", "NTA and they have a lot of nerve even asking directly like that, after this neighbor has caused problems for you and put your household at risk. They could have done a social media message, asked the city what resources were available, and done other research themselves. Do they go to church? This is the exact thing church people should help with too. Not neighbors who had no warning and have already been inconvenienced.", "NTA, it's not your property so not your responsibility.\n\nHowever, it's worth pointing out if you did participate, you would help speed up the clean-up and you would have a front row seat on the progress (or lack of). I've seen a lot of episodes of *Hoarders* on tv and there's always a combination of paid professionals (mental health expert, cleaning expert, etc) and volunteers to get the work done. Any house in a condition that's bad enough to get the town involved is likely more than the hoarder and family can handle, and since all neighbors would benefit from the hoard being gone, it explains why they are asking for your assistance.", "NTA you handled it with honesty and politeness. I respect that you understand that it is a mental illness.", "NTA.  I watch the tv show Hoarders and there are so many illnesses and health issues you can get, like breathing in black mold, just for starters.  I feel for the family helping, but I wouldn't put myself at risk.", "NTA - Speaking from experience.  I stepped up to look after an uncle who has mental health difficulties and hoards. I stepped up long before his hoarding got to the stage where your neighbours are.  I have continued to help my very appreciative but very difficult uncle for the last 15 years because he is family and nobody else was going to do it.  If you help, you will become the fantastic neighbour who helped...which will quickly turn into the contact point for social services, health care, town & Council.  You name it.   Your the 1st person they are going to call.   This is not your problem.", "That is some fecking nerve asking tbh. NTA.", "NTA. \nI would like to think that I would help someone in need. \n\nBut I have limits.  There is zero chance I would help clean out a hoarder\u2019s house.  They need professionals for that job, with proper hazard equipment \n\nUgh ugh ugh.", "NTA!! Leptospirosis can kill you.", "NTA.  It is a sad situation, but no way would I put my health at risk because of it.", "Don\u2019t go in that house. \n\nI have a hoarder in my IL\u2019s family. It\u2019s been going on for years, lots of enabling, not interested in therapy, lots of boundary crossing, etc.\n\nEven with restrictions on when and how we will be in the same space as this person (not their house, but family member\u2019s house), we all got sick. Everyone in my family had to be treated for leptospirosis.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I have hoarders whose backyard touches my backyard.  Something similar happened but another neighbor asked if I could help.  I told them no for the same reason, while their yard isn\u2019t a mess I am not gm leaning their house to risk my health.  They had 10 cats so I knew that cat droppings would be everywhere.", "Judging by the post, according to a neighbor, who lives right next to the hoarder, adult protective services is already involved. That\u2019s probably the only reason the hoarders family showed up. The city is imposing, all sorts of fines and fees, and probably threatening to bill them for the cleanup Without letting the hoarder grab anything. They probably have a set date. This is supposed to be done by. \n\nI have personally dealt with many hoarders, and it almost always was something super obvious that the family should\u2019ve noticed. Something strange that always happens is they always try to make it into the neighbors problem.", "I could see asking if you're really in a bind a d desperate for help. But it's definitely something that you need to accept a no for. Assisting like this is an exceptionally above and beyond neighborly thing to do and should never be expected or required.", "Gym membership (for access to showers)?   Portable monitor (basically a plug in big screen for your mobile phone to make catching videos more pleasant)?  A restaurant meal? (I\u2019m assuming there is some kind of social service so he\u2019s not literally starving - obviously if there\u2019s not, then bulk calories is the way to go \u2026 just thinking that if he\u2019s not starving, one fancy meal might be it\u2019s if a gift than several average/tinned meals).", "I think the justify it because it has already been the neighbor's problem, and they think the neighbors should want to help clean up the mess, right? But what they've failed to realize in most cases is that the neighbors hit their limit a LONG time before the family showed up. Having to put down rat poison in your own yard because the neighbors have infested your home is WELL past my limit.", "No, it's a rough situation.  GF's mom was a hoarder, but they cleared it up years befloe I was involved.  She's not hoarding now, but they had to gut the house, and people are checking in on her daily.  It never ends and does require constant work.", "I think they mentioned some time very soon in the new year, so it\u2019s possibly a week or two. It takes a few hours to give our house a good scrub down every week and that\u2019s just the normal stuff like swapping sheets and doing a minor bathroom clean to supplement the monthly deep clean. I can\u2019t imagine the time required for this.", "\"please come into my unhealthy house\"?", "They are looking for help.  It\u2019s ok to ask and definitely ok to say no.", "\"Please help me with a terrible situation that I'm not equipped to deal with by myself, these are the tools I have to make it safer\" is the ask. And it's a BIG ask, but for someone with a time crunch and not a lot of funds to do the job, I don't think it's unreasonable to solicit help. The problem is not accepting the very reasonable refusal. No one is obligated to put themselves in that situation, and the neighbors' family member didn't seem to understand that.", "The time to ask for help was before they let their relation's home get to the state where it was damaging the neighbor's homes. I am fully embracing that there is a limit to the help that exists, and that hoarding is a mental disorder, but anyone who is trying to salvage the home because they're going to get a profit from it needs to also be held seriously accountable for the damages over the many years during which they ignored the problem."]}
