They need to reach out to the city and get in touch with professionals (cleaners and head-shrinks) to help the hoarder.  Or the house will refill faster than ever.  Of they truely are hoarders, then it is a mental issue that must be properly and professionally addressed.\n\nThey are lucky someone didnt call adult protective services or other associations before now.", "Absolutely NTA - that's disgusting and unhealthy. I cannot even imagine asking someone to go into a home requiring respirators to not get sick.", "nta. this is not on you, and pushing when you first declined was shitty. the time they\u2019re spending trying to guilt the neighbors into free (hazardous) labour would be better spent trying to clean the house imho. stick a plea for help on facebook and get working.", "This is not your problem. The family ignored their hoarder relative up until the point the town got involved. You want to save money by ignoring a problem? You got to pay up when it\u2019s time to actually fix it. They probably have all kinds of liens and fines, and all sorts of legal matters pressing against them for ignoring their relative. Do not feel guilty one bit. As far as I am concerned, your wife already did yawls part by throwing rat poison in the yard.\n\nSTRONG NTA on this one. The hoarders family should have done some thing when they first realized there was a problem. This kind of shit does not happen out of nowhere. It is a slow climb that everybody witnesses.

When I finally escaped, it took less than a year for the house to be full and he was evicted.  We all went to help the landlord clean it up, 9 full big roll-off dumpsters were filled.  His sisters got him into a small apartment, and he filled it up, when the apartment saw they also evicted him.  I think my son went and helped clean it up then too.  He is now living in his car.  It's unfortunate but he did it all to himself.  None of our children will help him due to past abuse, his sisters will not help him because he started verbally abusing them.  I don't know what he is doing, I told him where he could go to get social services, but he made excuses and said his sisters did everything that caused his homelessness, they didn't.  \n\nI know it has nothing to do with your neighbor, but thanks for listening to my little bit of experience with a hoarder.  \n\n If anyone has a suggestion on what I can help my youngest son buy for his father for Christmas, tips appreciated.  I was thinking some canned food with the pop tops and things like that. \n\nDon't expose yourself to the filth in that home.  It was terrible when I helped my ex.", "NTA - I understand that yes Hoarding is a mental illness but it's their mess to get out of on their own. Not the responsibility of the neighbors to help due to the costs.", "NTA - you are under no obligation to risk your own health for your neighbor. Also, I would be hesitant to go into this situation with the family. Services to clean hoarder houses are expensive for a reason: there is a lot of liability involved on either side. The work can be dangerous and you could get pulled into family issues or accused of trying to steal, etc. Community mental health services and adult protective services, or the Council on Aging may have ideas about how the family can get assistance for the clean out.", "NTA you don\u2019t just wake up and see the \u201cmess.\u201d This is things that has been building up for years and years, and they chose to do nothing until it couldn\u2019t be ignored any longer. \n\nIt is completely unacceptable for them to put others at risk for them failing at keeping up with the issue. I doubt they are not aware of the kind of diseases and health concerns that could potentially be in that house. The fact that they are not paying for professionals to do this right is unhinged, and completely irresponsible. \n\nLook OP you\u2019re not in the wrong for saying no, which the family member should\u2019ve accepted and not force it. I also don\u2019t think any neighbors should put their life at risk by going into that home, especially if they have kids or auto immune compromise family members in their lives. Imagine the things that they could be taking back to their household, honestly I hate being a stick in the mud, but I think you should be reporting this, either somebody condemn the house or they get actual professionals who knows what they are doing and can do it safely.", "NTA. absolutely do not help them. This opens the door to can you do this or that. You\u2019re so close and we live an hour away. Next thing you\u2019ll be asked to take them to their dr appointments. Do not help. Not only that but gross. They can pull more family together to help. Keep your distance.", "NTA.

They could have done a social media message, asked the city what resources were available, and done other research themselves. Do they go to church? This is the exact thing church people should help with too. Not neighbors who had no warning and have already been inconvenienced.", "NTA, it's not your property so not your responsibility.\n\nHowever, it's worth pointing out if you did participate, you would help speed up the clean-up and you would have a front row seat on the progress (or lack of). I've seen a lot of episodes of *Hoarders* on tv and there's always a combination of paid professionals (mental health expert, cleaning expert, etc) and volunteers to get the work done. Any house in a condition that's bad enough to get the town involved is likely more than the hoarder and family can handle, and since all neighbors would benefit from the hoard being gone, it explains why they are asking for your assistance.", "NTA you handled it with honesty and politeness.

I stepped up long before his hoarding got to the stage where your neighbours are.  I have continued to help my very appreciative but very difficult uncle for the last 15 years because he is family and nobody else was going to do it.  If you help, you will become the fantastic neighbour who helped...which will quickly turn into the contact point for social services, health care, town & Council.  You name it.   Your the 1st person they are going to call.   This is not your problem.", "That is some fecking nerve asking tbh.

Everyone in my family had to be treated for leptospirosis.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I have hoarders whose backyard touches my backyard.  Something similar happened but another neighbor asked if I could help.  I told them no for the same reason, while their yard isn\u2019t a mess I am not gm leaning their house to risk my health.  They had 10 cats so I knew that cat droppings would be everywhere.", "Judging by the post, according to a neighbor, who lives right next to the hoarder, adult protective services is already involved. That\u2019s probably the only reason the hoarders family showed up. The city is imposing, all sorts of fines and fees, and probably threatening to bill them for the cleanup Without letting the hoarder grab anything. They probably have a set date. This is supposed to be done by. \n\nI have personally dealt with many hoarders, and it almost always was something super obvious that the family should\u2019ve noticed. Something strange that always happens is they always try to make it into the neighbors problem.\n\nObviously NTA", "I could see asking if you're really in a bind a d desperate for help.

Portable monitor (basically a plug in big screen for your mobile phone to make catching videos more pleasant)?  A restaurant meal? (I\u2019m assuming there is some kind of social service so he\u2019s not literally starving - obviously if there\u2019s not, then bulk calories is the way to go \u2026 just thinking that if he\u2019s not starving, one fancy meal might be it\u2019s if a gift than several average/tinned meals).", "I think the justify it because it has already been the neighbor's problem, and they think the neighbors should want to help clean up the mess, right? But what they've failed to realize in most cases is that the neighbors hit their limit a LONG time before the family showed up. Having to put down rat poison in your own yard because the neighbors have infested your home is WELL past my limit.", "No, it's a rough situation.  GF's mom was a hoarder, but they cleared it up years befloe I was involved.  She's not hoarding now, but they had to gut the house, and people are checking in on her daily.  It never ends and does require constant work.", "I think they mentioned some time very soon in the new year, so it\u2019s possibly a week or two.

It\u2019s ok to ask and definitely ok to say no.", "\"Please help me with a terrible situation that I'm not equipped to deal with by myself, these are the tools I have to make it safer\" is the ask. And it's a BIG ask, but for someone with a time crunch and not a lot of funds to do the job, I don't think it's unreasonable to solicit help. The problem is not accepting the very reasonable refusal. No one is obligated to put themselves in that situation, and the neighbors' family member didn't seem to understand that.", "The time to ask for help was before they let their relation's home get to the state where it was damaging the neighbor's homes. I am fully embracing that there is a limit to the help that exists, and that hoarding is a mental disorder, but anyone who is trying to salvage the home because they're going to get a profit from it needs to also be held seriously accountable for the damages over the many years during which they ignored the problem.", "NTA\n\nNeighbor in the hospital? They need you to pick up their mail or feed the cat? Widowed lady next door needs some weeds pulled? That's neighborly help. Putting your health at risk cleaning up a biohazardous situation is not a reasonable ask.", "NTA. \n\nIt's okay to ask for help, and it's also okay to decline to help.\n\nIt's not okay to not accept the refusal and get pushy about it.", "NAH they asked, you don't want to.", "Nta. I'm sorry for your neighbor however your health and safety come before them.", "If it's a true hoarding situation, professional cleaners need to be involved to make it a safe environment.

They need professional cleaners and will probably have to have another extermination service.  If it's particularly bad, they'll probably need a dumpster dropped in their driveway.  This isn't something for neighbors to do.", "NTA. I\u2019ve cleaned out houses that were damn full, but not quite on hoarder level. It\u2019s hard work. I wouldn\u2019t be doing that for free even without the disease risk.", "Is hantavirus is Curable?\r  \nThere is no specific treatment or cure for hantavirus infection - rat droppings.\n\nLeptospirosis, also called Weil's disease, from rats piss essentially.\n\nneeds tear proof gloves for one, the hoarding is self inflicted and for the family not to have noticed seems unlikely", "NTA, but I'm a freak and it would be my dream to help clean a hoarder house ONLY IF THE OCCUPANT IS NOT ON THE PREMESIS. Hoarding to that degree is a mental illness. They are as attached to their possessions as they would be to children or pets, so they can't even fathom throwing out a piece of cardboard. I can understand you not wanting to help due to illness or injury, though. It's not for everyone. The problem will just re-emerge or transfer to a new property. This has to be dealt with each day by a hands on therapist for anything to actually make a difference.", "NTA\n\nThere's a reason why professional clean up services are so expensive and you just listed them. A hoarder house is DANGEROUS with risks of bodily injury and diseases.\n\nFamily should have stepped in a long time ago.", "They have cajones to let it get that bad and then asking the neighborhood whose had to live with it all these years for help.\n\nNTA", "Asking for volunteers is fine, pushing when they say no is not. NTA.", "NTA, if there's mice, rats, etc. In the house/yard and the infestation is bad enough, you need special protective suits and masks. It's their problem and I'd have called the city sooner as their hording is not only a danger to them but everyone around them as it's a fire hazard and pest problem.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t do it. This person (people) needs intensive therapy. It ain\u2019t enough to just clean up and call it a day. \n\nI guarantee it will be 10 times worse by this time next year. They need professional help.\n\nYou could call Hoarders for them?", "NTA. When you're mentally ill it may not be your fault but it is your responsibility. The 'your' in this situation being that neighbour who hoards.\n\nAnd not OP, any of the nearby neighbours or their family.", "NTA\n\nIt ok to ask I guess, but it\u2019s not ok to NOT ACCEPT the no.", "NTA. It\u2019s not safe. You could get really sick from pet feces, black mold, insects from stacked garbage, not to mention the other things you mentioned. It\u2019s very sad that this has happened, but professionals should be doing this or they and their family should take those risks.", "NTA... professional cleaners are needed for this", "Nta there's a reason that cleaning out a hoarder house is done by specialists.

Be there in a different way if you can.", "NTA and not your responsibility. It is a mental illness and no matter how many times people clean it up the property will return to what it is now. Only the person who lives there can change that if they recognize their behavior and actively work with a therapist. \n\nNext time, because there will be if that person continues to live there, contact APS at the first signs of rats or what looks to be an unhealthy living situation.", "NTA. holy shit!! the audacity to ask randoms to clean up their vermin laced filth. what the actual fuck. that's \ud83c\udf4c \ud83c\udf4c \ud83c\udf4c!!\n\nno need to feel guilty yo. that's their mess not yours.", "Definitely NTA for not helping clean up. I'm shocked they had the guts to ask you, and it's ridiculous they pressured you about it even after saying no. I will say, YTA for using poison to kill the rats. Rats get eaten and those animals die after ingesting the poisoned rat. Too many animals pass this way. Please skip poison and sticky animal traps, neither should be legal imo.", "You could give some support by taking drinks and maybe snacks to the workers. That's also emotional support.\n\nI wouldn't be keen to enter a rat infested den either, but rat catchers will invariably overstate the dangers and display their vocabulary. Don't worry too much, but take sensible precautions.", "NAH. They asked, you refused. Both were within your rights.", "NTA at all. I am not sure what your circumstances are but if I were living next to this I would gladly volunteer to take truckloads of trash to whatever dump it needed to go to so they could save time on that. But I wouldn't step foot inside of that house.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I wouldn't help, either. That kind of cleanup must be done professionally and with professional/industrial cleaning products. It requires far more than a respirator mask, more like a hazmat suit and thick gloves. If you want to help, do it anonymously (so they don't pester you in the future) through a grocery store gift card or something similar. The relatives are desperate and will attempt to recruit you endlessly if/when they find out you're sympathetic to their plea for help.", "OP is definitely NTA, but I will pipe up to say that it\u2019s not always on the family either. There is hoarding in my family. We have tried for DECADES to help those family members, to go over and clean with them and for them, to try to hold yard sales. (Not all hoards are filled with vermin) You cannot force a hoarder to get rid of things; professionals are likely needed, and even at that, the hoarder has to be ready to work with the professionals. It\u2019s exhausting and extremely frustrating. By the time city services are involved I can almost guarantee the family have also reached their limit.", "Thanks!", "Then the family just needs to let go. That\u2019s what happened in the hoarding situation. I spoke about the family was too obsessed over trying to get the property back in order to sell it. They completely forgot about the fact that there is someone extremely mentally ill living in their own filth. In the situation I spoke about the city did take the house and demolished it from what I heard. They faced serious fines because they were known by the neighbors to come over once every Christmas to receive their presents. The neighbors who called the city on the hoarder made that very clear the family knew. Sometimes you have to do things you don\u2019t want to, and that will hurt someone\u2019s feelings for their own good.\n\nYes, most hordes don\u2019t always include food. As they collect cans of food or other things edible usually what happens is they buy groceries and put 70 boxes in front of the cabinet and forget that they put bread and other expiry things in there. Then the rats come.", "Yup. One of my friends is perpetually dealing with this with one of her family members. It's taking everyone's combined effort to just keep things relatively safe. The family member in question refuses help and becomes extremely combative when the subject is even brought up. They are completely fully functional in every other way, so unless/ until they WANT to get help, there's nothing the family can do. The family is very reasonably unwilling to let them get injured or die in that condition, so they do what they can. It's exhausting, stressful, and miserable. I only know how bad it is because I got to be the one running distraction while my friend threw out all the expired food and all the junk she could haul to the landfill.", "I literally had to get tetanus shots and a rabies vaccination. The last time I helped a hoarder. It turns out what looks like a box of mice is actually a box of mice and nails.", "And respirators won't cut it.  You would need reinforced footwear and possibly even Tyvek suits for this level of hoarding.   The house is ruined.  It would be likely easier to have the place demolished.", "Absolutely.  Been there, done that. Tyvek suit with booties and gloves plus respirator required.", "How are they profiting from it?", "NTA.  Why the family thinks that neighbors should assist when the hoarder in question has brought rodents to the area, created a blight that's probably lowered the home values on the whole block if not several blocks.  F that!  You and your neighbors have paid enough of a price!", "NTA. First of all, it's not your responsibility. While it might be a nice gesture to help out someone in need, in today's world, it not only is a health and safety hazard for you/your wife but also is a massive liability in regards to property damage/theft accusations. What happens when the neighbor says, \"I know I left my Rolex in that box\" only to have it now \"missing?\" The neighbor needs professional help, prayers, and probably professional cleaners. I doubt that even with their best efforts the family can get the house clean enough to pass an inspection.", "Absolutely NTA. I was married to a hoarder and my reaction to them is visceral. They\u2019re abusers - to their families, to animals, and to their neighbors. \n\nIMHO, they should be considered criminals and not be allowed to be in society. Yes, it\u2019s a mental illness, but hoarders are virtually untreatable. Any time and effort you potentially make will be completely wasted. Just No.", "NTA \n\nWow, the balls on this person to ask neighbors to clean up the mess! And then to guilt you for not wanting to?\n\nThe pending eviction is a blessing, it is not on your best interest to help this person out. Hoarding is a mental disorder, they will never change. Even if the yard gets cleaned up, the person will just re-hoard.", "Honestly, there are people who do YouTube videos about doing deep cleanings like this. I'd probably suggest that your neighbours family contact them at this point. I wouldn't want to get involved at this stage without proper training either.", "...  When they sell the property rather than surrendering it to the city or state?"]}
