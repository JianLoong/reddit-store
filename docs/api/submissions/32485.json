She went to pick up dinner while I put the finishing touches on her cake, then texted saying she found $200 in the parking lot outside the restaurant. I texted my boyfriend (25m) a lighthearted message saying it was fortuitous on her bday. \n\nWhen she got home, she said she felt bad that someone had lost it and wanted to do her best to return it. She called the restaurant and gave them her contact info if anyone came in searching for lost money (unspecified amount, she wanted to be able to verify the owner). \n\nMy boyfriend then texted me saying it\u2019s criminal possession and that she needs to hand it over to the police IMMEDIATELY since someone is probably very distraught especially this close to Christmas. We live in an affluent town, so I made a quip about it being from a rich grandma who only carries cash. He told me he didn\u2019t find that very funny. I then explained that my mom had every intention of finding the owner and would bring it to the police station if nobody contacted her during the night. \n\nWhen he called me later, he instantly questioned if the cops got the money. I said not yet- we were busy with the party. But we had taken steps and if nothing happened, we would hand it in tomorrow. He then got condescending saying that we were handling it so stupid. That she needs to hand it in NOW. I reminded him that she would tomorrow, but I think what she\u2019d done is ok for the night. \n\nHe then again said it\u2019s her legal obligation to turn it in. At this point I was exasperated from the constant explaining that it WOULD get to the cops. So (and I do acknowledge my snarky attitude) I said \u201cdriving the speed limit is also your legal obligation, doesn\u2019t mean you do it ALL the time\u201d. He screamed \u201comg you\u2019re deflecting! I can\u2019t deal with you! Bye!\u201d and hung up on me. I\u2019m no stranger to being abruptly hung up on and ignored by him, but he then sent: \u201cyou and your family are so dissociated from regular people it\u2019s disgusting\u201d.\n\nI just don't understand. My mom is fully planning on having that money returned! I get this level of anger if I had said \u201chaha screw that loser, we\u2019re keeping the money and they can suffer\u201d. But that\u2019s not the case at all. However, I do come from a wealthier background than he does, and he often makes jabs about it.\n\nIt\u2019s not like he's a super nice guy tho. He is cruel about everyone he sees. But he recently got a law-enforcement-adjacent job, so maybe it\u2019s that? Maybe jealousy? Maybe a manifestation of his issues with my family\u2019s money? \n\nI thought we were doing the right thing here, but now I\u2019m questioning it because of his reaction. My boyfriend does have a history of wild outbursts, but I want to know if his feelings and actions were justified from how we handled this situation.\n\nAITA for not immediately turning the money in to the cops?", "created_utc": 1701894839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cdh69/aita_for_the_way_i_handled_this_found_money/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
