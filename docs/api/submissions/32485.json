We live in an affluent town, so I made a quip about it being from a rich grandma who only carries cash. He told me he didn\u2019t find that very funny. I then explained that my mom had every intention of finding the owner and would bring it to the police station if nobody contacted her during the night. \n\nWhen he called me later, he instantly questioned if the cops got the money. I said not yet- we were busy with the party. But we had taken steps and if nothing happened, we would hand it in tomorrow. He then got condescending saying that we were handling it so stupid. That she needs to hand it in NOW. I reminded him that she would tomorrow, but I think what she\u2019d done is ok for the night. \n\nHe then again said it\u2019s her legal obligation to turn it in.
