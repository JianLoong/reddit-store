{"id": 15679, "submission_id": "12yt653", "title": "AITA for calling my brother's wife a bad mom?", "selftext": "My brother's wife, Tam, always wanted a daughter. She had two sons and decided she was done having kids. They signed up for foster to adopt. Tam bonded with the baby girl placed with them, even though everyone warned her there was no guarantee the baby would become eligible for adoption. She did become eligible, and so did her older brother, and my brother and his wife were asked if they would adopt him as well.\n\nTam didn't want to adopt the boy, but my brother wasn't comfortable with separating siblings. He said it was both or neither, because he wouldn't be able to look the little girl in the eyes of he rejected her brother. Tam was upset, but she agreed to adopt him. Ever since the adoption Tam has struggled. She says it's similar to postpartum depression. I'm not qualified to say it is or isn't, but I don't believe so. All of her struggles center around her adopted son.\n\nShe gets upset because he talks to his sister in a language no one else in the house knows. She says it's because it gives her anxiety to not know what he's saying and even when he repeats himself in English \"he could be lying about what he said.\" She also gets frustrated with some pretty innocuous behavior from him, like he always separates out his food and he likes to rearrange stuff like shoe racks and toy bins. I think he has autism or OCD and should be evaluated, but she thinks he's doing it to upset her. She insists she treats all the children the same, but that hasn't been my observation (granted I'm not around them every day). She gets frustrated with him quickly and doesn't praise him like she does the younger children.\n\nYesterday I picked the boys up from school because she had to bring the daughter to an appointment. I was supposed to stay for dinner. She was happy and smiling when she got home, but her mood immediately dropped when she saw her oldest. The kids all went to the backyard to play, and I helped her start dinner. She told me that the oldest makes her feel like a bad mom because loving him is such hard work.\n\nI got frustrated with her and told her *he* doesn't make her feel like a bad mom. She is being a bad mom to him. She started listing all his \"problems\" and explaining how she's struggling with her mental health. I said those are all excuses and she's not doing right by him. She said it's not her fault, and I said she never should have adopted either of those children if she couldn't love them both. She accused me of always disliking her and never really accepting her as a member of the family because she has a different background. I said she was projecting because that's literally what she's doing to her son.\n\nShe asked me to leave, and I did. My brother is upset with me. He said I set back his wife's mental health and made everything worse so I could feel holier than thou. He might be right. What I said probably won't make anything better.

If she wasn\u2019t prepared to love both, she never should have agreed to take both in. \n\nThrough this whole ordeal, she has been selfish. She wasn\u2019t thinking about what was best for the girl or the boy, she just wanted a daughter, even if that meant separating her from her brother. Adoption and fostering shouldn\u2019t be the place to get your \u201cdesigner family,\u201d and parents who adopt just so they can tack on a child of their desired gender really have no business adopting, in my opinion. What if the daughter starts showing signs of autism or other neurodivergency as she grows up? Will she also be \u201cdoing things\u201d to make the mom upset? Will she get a pass because she\u2019s the daughter she always wanted, and hypocritically punish the older boy for behaviors his younger sister is also doing? Neither is a good mindset to have.\n\nShe\u2019s denying that boy a loving home and the support he needs because of her imagined narrative. *She is the adult.* Her mental state did not make her *choose* to adopt that boy. She needs to be responsible and seek the support and help she needs for her own mental health issues rather than using it to scapegoat a specific child. She needs to be the adult, and the *parent* she signed up to be.", "NTA - she sounds like a narcissistic nightmare! You were only standing up for your nephew. You were being the supportive adult he clearly needs in his life. Are your parents still in the picture? If so, so they see the emotional abuse for what it is as well?", "NTA. Push your brother to get the boy tested. Better to know for certain. Might even change the way Tam feels or deals with him. If nothing else a wakeup call for your brother.", "NTA. She didn't want the child, and now she's treating the child poorly. Your brother had good intentions not wanting to separate the siblings but in reality, this outcome was predictable. She should have been the adult and said \"neither\", since she clearly just wanted a baby (and likely, a girl) and knew up front she wouldn't treat the other child right.\n\nThere's never an excuse to treat a child poorly. If you have mental health issues, it is your responsibility to get the care you need so that you aren't making a child suffer.  If a child struggles with behavior (which is again predictable in a situation like this) you get them help and resources.\n\nSome people are triggered by the phrase \"bad mom/ bad parent\" but IMO, if the shoe fits.... you're never an AH for genuinely sticking up for a child.", "That family needs therapy.  STAT", "Someone needs to stick up for that boy. Your brother and SIL are not. If her mental health is so bad then she needs therapy/medication. There's something wrong with her that she can't love a little boy just because he's a boy. She's in charge of her own mental health.  Not that little boy.\n\nIf she can't get past this, I would contact CPS because she is harming him. NTA but you would be for not looking out for him. Talk to your brother.", "You need to get in touch with the children\u2019s case worker and tell them your concerns.\n\nThis is neglect and it will escalate into abuse.\n\nPlease help this child.", "NTA - This is a horrific situation. I hope that whole family is in counseling.", "NTA but I think you should bring up these concerns with your brother instead of Tam. It\u2019s possible that she alters her reactions when he is around or rationalizes the issues to him and he isn\u2019t there enough to see this. If Tam has mental health issues she needs to be receiving help for that. Honestly all adoptive parents need some trauma informed training and that alone would likely weed out some of these situations but also the foster system is so difficult.", "NTA!\n\nOP PLEASE show this thread to your brother!!! He really needs to wake up and see the truth of the situation and how sh!tty his wife is acting to their son!! He also needs to wake up and realize his wife's excuses for her behavior are just that... EXCUSES!!", "SIL is an awful AH, she's selfish just because she wanted the baby girl she took them both but rejects the boy. \nShe's a terrible parent.

That poor boy doesn't deserve that.", "NTA.  This is sad.  They really should not have adopted either child.  Your brother was right in not wanting to separate the siblings but since his wife REALLY did not want the boy then they should have passed on both.", "Her \u201cparanoia\u201d over the boy speaking his first language is racist, I wouldn\u2019t let her be alone with this kid if she\u2019s spinning narratives he\u2019s intentionally out to get her and playing mind games.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother was at fault too; he should have listened to what she was saying and realised this adoption wasn't in the kids' best interests.", "NTA. She is a bad mom and someone has to speak up for that little boy. Your brother should be doing that instead of chastising you and making excuses for his wife\u2019s crappy behavior.", "Really, I think you just brought all of her problems to the foreground. \n\nIt\u2019s possible she tried to shame you by repeating what you said verbatim to her husband.

That boy came from foster care. The system is so broken and the kids in the system come from trauma. He definitely needs to be in therapy. You're completely right. She is being a bad mom to him by not trying to connect or help him in any way. Sure, he could be talking crap or doing things out of spite. But that's all the more reason for therapy.

He knew his wife, and he had to say both or nothing because she was being so selfish. He should have put his foot down and said No because of how his wife was acting. \n\nAnd both of them stole the chance at finding a loving family from that boy.", "Our dad lives in a retirement community. He sees the children sometimes, but he doesn't have a full picture of the domestic situation.", "Very well put!! \\^\\^\\^", "Just to clarify - are you saying her abuse is justified because she struggles with mental illness?", "Are you kidding? The SIL never wanted to adopt this child and now, conveniently, all her \u201cstruggles\u201d are about the boy. She\u2019s using mental health to justify her mistreatment of one of her children.", "No, sometimes this is just the reality check such persons or their family need to make a change. \n\nAnd honestly to call out a person who behaves wrong against a child is never wrong. It is never an AH move. \n\nIt is to make a change for the kid or to protect the kid who is innocent and cannot speak for themselves. The kid is completely dependent from this woman. He cannot just move out or leave if she treats him wrong. So it is good others speak up for him. \n\nWould it be better to just look the other way and say nothing? And when would be the right time to stop looking the other way then? When he gets refused dinner because of a bagatelle? Or when he gets treated differently as his siblings?  When she abuses  him physically? Or when she abuses him mentally or emotionally? Where would you draw the line and when would be the time to stop looking the other way? Isn't it like people complain that too many look the other way too often? \n\nWould we draw the line when she neglects the kid by withholding love and affection? \n\nBecause that's what she does she refuses love and affection for this kid. And *that's* an AH move. OP was very right to call her out.", "So her mental illness should be treated but that aren't the case causing her son to suffer for it", "Ah, I see. Well, regardless of what other commenters might say - I am proud of you for sticking up for him. It sounds very much like a narcissist/golden child/scapegoat situation - much like one I grew up in myself and boy is the trauma a lot to process!   \nMy unsolicited advice (should you decide to read it) is if you feel comfortable alerting authorities about her behavior, I encourage you to do so. If you don't feel comfortable with that, it is totally understandable, it is a huge can of worms to open. Maybe instead you could make sure to always make a big deal about your adopted nephew? Be the funcle that puts the wind in his sails?", "No. Mental illness isn't an excuse and I'm not granting her permission to abuse the child.\n\nHowever, Mental illness is the cause of this abuse and until and unless that is addressed and resolved, the abuse will continue. That's just the reality.\n\nAnd if you point a finger at a mentally ill person and tell them that they're a terrible parent and make everyone miserable, you're adding fuel to the fire.", ">No, sometimes this is just the reality check such persons or their family need to make a change.\n\nNo, it's verbal abuse.\n\nThere are constructive ways to call people out for their behaviors and destructive ways. This was a destructive way to call her out.", "I don't think this child being sent back to foster care, potentially without his sister, would improve his situation in any way.\n\nIt doesn't really matter, but I'm actually his aunt.", "I agree that mental illness is the cause of the abuse - however, Tam seems to be using said mental illness to justify the abuse as well - or at least justify not needing to change her behavior. I could be wrong, but that's my takeaway.", "Not everybody is a therapist to begin with so not everybody knows how to criticize in a constructive way when it comes to depressed or mentally ill people. \n\nAnd although she claims she has mental issues it's unclear what these issues are and if she got diagnosed. To me it seems like this is only a protective statement from her. Because although I'm not a professional and might be wrong someting like post partum without  actually giving birth is impossible. Its called post *partum* for a reason. \n\nThis women undoubtly has issues but whether she qualifies for a mental illness is questionable at least. So expecting that others tiptoe around her pretended mental illness just in order to not upset her points if at all more in the direction of a narcicist. And narcicists need such direct and open reality checks. It's not constructive I agree. But constructive criticism would anyways not work with a narcicist. Same applies for AH. Constructive criticism is mostly useless with AH. \n\nIMO when it comes to a child that is being abused or neglected the priority is the child and not the abuser. I don't care if this women is mentally or physically ill or simply an AH. She abuses this kid and OP simply called a spade a spade. SIL did not like this probably because deep down she knew OP was right. And that's why she threw a fit as soon as hubby came home.", "Telling someone they\u2019re being a bad parent is not verbal abuse. Not every sentence that is less than rainbows and sunshine is abusive. \n\nIf you look at a man who is abusing his wife and say \u201cyou\u2019re a bad partner\u201d is that verbal abuse?", "That's a very good point too. Ugh! What a predicament - I'm so sorry you are dealing with this!! \n\nAlso, I realized after I posted that you never revealed your gender, so my sincerest apologies! Be that cool, supportive *aunt* for your nephew that puts the wind in his sails instead ;)", "They might not get sent back to foster care, they\u2019re more likely to be placed in family therapy.\n\nPlease please please get into contact with the children\u2019s case worker and let them know what\u2019s happening.\n\nIf you don\u2019t help the child then you\u2019re allowing him to be hurt.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on behind the scenes that OP hasn\u2019t seen but from where I\u2019m standing, it looks like hubby emotionally exploited Tam to get her to agree to adopt the boy. I don\u2019t like anybody who uses a kid as a bargaining chip, so hubby is my least favorite person in this story the way it\u2019s presented.", "1. I didn\u2019t say the child wasn\u2019t the priority\n2. Constructive criticism is a life skill most of us learned in school. \n3. If you make the mentally ill parent worse, the child will suffer more. Ergo, the mentally ill parent needs help in order to help the child.", "Can you walk me through your reasoning? Because I can't wrap my head around it. My brother didn't want to separate two siblings, and that's emotional exploitation?"]}
