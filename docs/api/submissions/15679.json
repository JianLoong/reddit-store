She had two sons and decided she was done having kids. They signed up for foster to adopt. Tam bonded with the baby girl placed with them, even though everyone warned her there was no guarantee the baby would become eligible for adoption. She did become eligible, and so did her older brother, and my brother and his wife were asked if they would adopt him as well.\n\nTam didn't want to adopt the boy, but my brother wasn't comfortable with separating siblings. He said it was both or neither, because he wouldn't be able to look the little girl in the eyes of he rejected her brother. Tam was upset, but she agreed to adopt him. Ever since the adoption Tam has struggled. She says it's similar to postpartum depression. I'm not qualified to say it is or isn't, but I don't believe so. All of her struggles center around her adopted son.\n\nShe gets upset because he talks to his sister in a language no one else in the house knows. She says it's because it gives her anxiety to not know what he's saying and even when he repeats himself in English \"he could be lying about what he said.\" She also gets frustrated with some pretty innocuous behavior from him, like he always separates out his food and he likes to rearrange stuff like shoe racks and toy bins. I think he has autism or OCD and should be evaluated, but she thinks he's doing it to upset her. She insists she treats all the children the same, but that hasn't been my observation (granted I'm not around them every day). She gets frustrated with him quickly and doesn't praise him like she does the younger children.\n\nYesterday I picked the boys up from school because she had to bring the daughter to an appointment. I was supposed to stay for dinner. She was happy and smiling when she got home, but her mood immediately dropped when she saw her oldest. The kids all went to the backyard to play, and I helped her start dinner. She told me that the oldest makes her feel like a bad mom because loving him is such hard work.\n\nI got frustrated with her and told her *he* doesn't make her feel like a bad mom. She is being a bad mom to him. She started listing all his \"problems\" and explaining how she's struggling with her mental health. I said those are all excuses and she's not doing right by him. She said it's not her fault, and I said she never should have adopted either of those children if she couldn't love them both. She accused me of always disliking her and never really accepting her as a member of the family because she has a different background. I said she was projecting because that's literally what she's doing to her son.\n\nShe asked me to leave, and I did. My brother is upset with me. He said I set back his wife's mental health and made everything worse so I could feel holier than thou. He might be right. What I said probably won't make anything better.

It is never an AH move. \n\nIt is to make a change for the kid or to protect the kid who is innocent and cannot speak for themselves. The kid is completely dependent from this woman. He cannot just move out or leave if she treats him wrong. So it is good others speak up for him. \n\nWould it be better to just look the other way and say nothing? And when would be the right time to stop looking the other way then? When he gets refused dinner because of a bagatelle? Or when he gets treated differently as his siblings?  When she abuses  him physically? Or when she abuses him mentally or emotionally? Where would you draw the line and when would be the time to stop looking the other way? Isn't it like people complain that too many look the other way too often? \n\nWould we draw the line when she neglects the kid by withholding love and affection? \n\nBecause that's what she does she refuses love and affection for this kid.

Well, regardless of what other commenters might say - I am proud of you for sticking up for him. It sounds very much like a narcissist/golden child/scapegoat situation - much like one I grew up in myself and boy is the trauma a lot to process!   \nMy unsolicited advice (should you decide to read it) is if you feel comfortable alerting authorities about her behavior, I encourage you to do so. If you don't feel comfortable with that, it is totally understandable, it is a huge can of worms to open. Maybe instead you could make sure to always make a big deal about your adopted nephew? Be the funcle that puts the wind in his sails?", "No. Mental illness isn't an excuse and I'm not granting her permission to abuse the child.\n\nHowever, Mental illness is the cause of this abuse and until and unless that is addressed and resolved, the abuse will continue. That's just the reality.\n\nAnd if you point a finger at a mentally ill person and tell them that they're a terrible parent and make everyone miserable, you're adding fuel to the fire.", ">No, sometimes this is just the reality check such persons or their family need to make a change.\n\nNo, it's verbal abuse.\n\nThere are constructive ways to call people out for their behaviors and destructive ways. This was a destructive way to call her out.", "I don't think this child being sent back to foster care, potentially without his sister, would improve his situation in any way.\n\nIt doesn't really matter, but I'm actually his aunt.", "I agree that mental illness is the cause of the abuse - however, Tam seems to be using said mental illness to justify the abuse as well - or at least justify not needing to change her behavior. I could be wrong, but that's my takeaway.", "Not everybody is a therapist to begin with so not everybody knows how to criticize in a constructive way when it comes to depressed or mentally ill people. \n\nAnd although she claims she has mental issues it's unclear what these issues are and if she got diagnosed. To me it seems like this is only a protective statement from her. Because although I'm not a professional and might be wrong someting like post partum without  actually giving birth is impossible. Its called post *partum* for a reason. \n\nThis women undoubtly has issues but whether she qualifies for a mental illness is questionable at least. So expecting that others tiptoe around her pretended mental illness just in order to not upset her points if at all more in the direction of a narcicist. And narcicists need such direct and open reality checks. It's not constructive I agree. But constructive criticism would anyways not work with a narcicist. Same applies for AH. Constructive criticism is mostly useless with AH. \n\nIMO when it comes to a child that is being abused or neglected the priority is the child and not the abuser. I don't care if this women is mentally or physically ill or simply an AH. She abuses this kid and OP simply called a spade a spade. SIL did not like this probably because deep down she knew OP was right. And that's why she threw a fit as soon as hubby came home.", "Telling someone they\u2019re being a bad parent is not verbal abuse.

I didn\u2019t say the child wasn\u2019t the priority\n2. Constructive criticism is a life skill most of us learned in school. \n3.

This behaviour wouldn't be anymore acceptable if it was a dude hating his daughters because they're not sons, so she doesn't get a free pass to claim \"mental health\" issues just because she has a slightly fuller house than she necessarily expected to have.\n\nI worry for the future of the eldest boy and his brothers. Imagine having such a cold mother who says, \"it's sooooo hard to love them\" even though they've done nothing to justify that comment.\n\nNTA she needed to be told. She needed to be informed that her bs was obvious and stank.", "You are speaking the truth. I was prepared to think you were wrong as calling someone a bad mom is the ultimate insult. But she\u2019s literally creating a serial killer by blaming and acting so poorly and unloving to him. She should love him as an extension of the daughter she wanted but he\u2019s an obstacle. This is a disaster and I wouldn\u2019t want the girl to suffer but having her brother there and him being treated that way is worse than him not being there. They both need new adoption or he deserves a chance at a real family.", "NTA\n\nThis absolutely breaks my heart and doesn't bode well for the future.\n\nI went to school with a family who did something similar. In addition to their own biological children, they adopted a pair of sisters. They really only wanted the one girl, but she had a sister with development issues who came part of the package. The way they treated that sister was abhorrent and the child never received an ounce of love. Eventually, she was unadopted and the sister parted ways from the family, as well. \n\nYour brother needs to get his wife into counselling immediately for the sake of that child. It won't take the kid long to realize that his adopted mother doesn't even want him. As if losing his first family wasn't traumatic enough...", "Nope, just honest", "NTA.

After that, it's 1 down, 2 more to go before she has the only child she really wanted.", "He didn't want to separate the siblings. His wife wanted to adopt the girl (remember she wanted a girl very badly and had only boys). He told her they wouldn't adopt the girl unless they adopted the boy as well. So he used her desire to have a daughter to force her to adopt the boy as well.\n\nIt's the difference between: \"I want to talk about this, I'm really not comfortable with separating siblings. Why are you hesitating on adopting the boy and is there anything we can do to convince you to see that he'd do well with us as parents\" and \"You can't adopt this girl you've raised for x months and bonded with unless you also adopt the boy\".\n\nOne is a conversation that could lead to compromise, the other is emotional exploitation.\n\nNow you can argue that the ends justify the means and I think that's what you're going to say. But that doesn't change the fact that the brother extorted his wife emotionally and used that girl as a bargaining chip.\n\nEdit to add: \n\nI'm also wondering if the behavioral problems you describe were her main reason in wanting to not adopt him and if they had a conversation around getting him help and family therapy and stuff. Because all other things aside, adopting a new child into the family is 100 the time for family therapy regardless of how well adjusted everyone is before it was made official.\n\nFWIW I'm not saying this stuff to be difficult or argumentative and I don't think your brother manipulated her intentionally to hurt her.", "Compromise? How do you compromise on something like that? My brother and I are from an ethnicity that has experienced a history of children being separated from families. It's a horrible, dreadful thing. He didn't want to perpetuate that same experience onto innocent children. Can you really not understand that?\n\nYou really think rearranging a shoe rack is a behavioral problem?", "So instead of compromising, just bulldoze over what your partner wants without addressing their needs and concerns.\n\nCompromise could be a lot of things. It could be she gets one day a month at the spa. It could be that they work with a child therapist on the behavioral issues. Could be he has to cook dinner more often. whatever.

I wonder if calling her a bad mom makes her improve at all, or does she just get defensive?  If it were me, I\u2019d put some extra effort into bonding with him so she can see what a great kid he is.
