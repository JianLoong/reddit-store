Your position is go, my position is not-go.. so how is  me just folding and going any sort of compromise.  Compromise is separate the dates and I'll go.\n\n That's the offer. I'm willing to hear counters that aren't simply capitulation. Another offer is that we can go to my choice as many times as I have had to go to his and then once we are even, we can have this conversation again. Also, any particular reason that Francis and I aren't worth the same amount as everybody else?

I said I wasn\u2019t super picky but that I prefer chocolate. \n\nShe demanded carrot cake every year that I worked there.

It was a bit of a relief when I got a job where people didn't even acknowledge anyone's birthdays outside of a mention in the monthly team meetings.", "NTA. I'm not sure what they think is a compromise. They are doing exactly as they please and not adjusting one bit for you:\n\n1. They want to take you and Francis out for the same meal even there's no possible way you can get the restaurant you want AND Francis get the restaurant he wants.\n2. They are OK with separating 4 bdays that are 4 days apart but they refuse to separate yours and Francis' birthday.\n3. They will celebrate on a day that's not the actual birthday (why? because they don't work weekends. check. because they don't want to eat out 4 days in a row. check) but not for you/Francis.\n4. You decide to let the celebration just focus on Francis and offer to contribute to his celebration, but NOPE. THEY don't like that and call you TA.\n\nSo again, where is the compromise they speak of?\n\nTalk to the supervisor. Tell him that this is no longer any form of kindness or office camaraderie. Either he needs to say ALL birthdays will be celebrated individually, or ALL birthday in a week will be celebrated at one lunch or just stop the whole thing. If he's not willing to institute something, you'll be happy to ask his supervisor to address this issue.\n\nBTW - WHO is the person deciding what 'the rules' are? If it's just someone who likes to dictate things, then ignore them. They are not the authority.

It isn't fair that you have to share when everyone else gets their own special lunch or you feel like you have to opt out and deprive yourself of your own birthday lunch just to make someone else feel better. Everyone deserves to feel special on their birthday. The same thing happened to me at my work. We all get to pick our own birthday cakes and if there was any leftover cake, we could take it home. One year, a girl was hired who had the same birthday as me. That year, I had to settle for a cake I didn't like and she got the leftover cake! I was so happy when she quit a few months later.

You can either make the best of it or start the traditional of people skipping out on it if they aren't happy with the circumstances.", "Because you're an adult who shouldn't care this much about getting free lunch on his bday.", "Yes. Hot doesn't equal flavor. He eats that super hot shit from places like Pepper Palace just for clout and to grab about wings not being hit enough when we go out. \n\nExample: he sent back mango Habanero wings accusing the server of mixing up the sauce to the point where she brought him the bottle to show him it was, in fact, mango hab. We all tried the sauce, and it was fucking habanero for sure", "Funny story, my boss is an odd one and a cheap ass. We ordered a sub-ring and pizza once because we figured we wanted variety for another guys Bday. Boss. Had. A. fit. \n\nWe csn bring food back, but no delivery is allowed at the facility i work at for security reasons. Used to be until one to many people screwed it up for the rest of us", "Only the most insecure people would think this. \n\nObviously it has nothing to do whether they like OP or not. If by chance they actually do dislike him then they wouldn't offer to take him out at all.", "Too lazy to read, i see. It's that my boss is a cheap ass, but whatever helps you sleep at night", "Lol, yeah you defiantly tell from a reddit profile.", "Its not about the lunch, but a matter of principle and ewual treatment.", "Read better. They don't get free lunch, they just all go to a restaurant", "This sounds like that hot one's The Bomb sauce. It's literally all fires of Mordor heat with the flavor of ass.", "I read that.\n\nHe\u2019s only a cheap ass for you two tho. Not for anyone else.\n\nThe writing is on the wall.", "Okay, sure. I guess this is the part where i tell you he's a cheap ass in every aspect of his life and this is just one more penny for him to pinch. Didnt know i had to write shit out in crayon for you, but then again, this *is* reddit...\n\nEdit: lol dude talks shit and then blocks like an absolute chud.", "You can *say* that, but it won\u2019t be true, will it? Since he shells out for literally everyone else to have their own birthday. \n\nJust accept that you\u2019re not liked,  (let\u2019s not forget NONE of your coworkers speak up for you either), put your head down and do you job. Maybe if you stop whining people will start to like you more.", "You're really unnecessarily nasty here."]}
