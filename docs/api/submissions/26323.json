Your position is go, my position is not-go.. so how is  me just folding and going any sort of compromise.  Compromise is separate the dates and I'll go.\n\n That's the offer. I'm willing to hear counters that aren't simply capitulation. Another offer is that we can go to my choice as many times as I have had to go to his and then once we are even, we can have this conversation again.

I said I wasn\u2019t super picky but that I prefer chocolate. \n\nShe demanded carrot cake every year that I worked there.

I'm not sure what they think is a compromise. They are doing exactly as they please and not adjusting one bit for you:\n\n1. They want to take you and Francis out for the same meal even there's no possible way you can get the restaurant you want AND Francis get the restaurant he wants.\n2. They are OK with separating 4 bdays that are 4 days apart but they refuse to separate yours and Francis' birthday.\n3. They will celebrate on a day that's not the actual birthday (why? because they don't work weekends. check. because they don't want to eat out 4 days in a row. check) but not for you/Francis.\n4. You decide to let the celebration just focus on Francis and offer to contribute to his celebration, but NOPE. THEY don't like that and call you TA.\n\nSo again, where is the compromise they speak of?\n\nTalk to the supervisor. Tell him that this is no longer any form of kindness or office camaraderie. Either he needs to say ALL birthdays will be celebrated individually, or ALL birthday in a week will be celebrated at one lunch or just stop the whole thing. If he's not willing to institute something, you'll be happy to ask his supervisor to address this issue.\n\nBTW - WHO is the person deciding what 'the rules' are?

It isn't fair that you have to share when everyone else gets their own special lunch or you feel like you have to opt out and deprive yourself of your own birthday lunch just to make someone else feel better. Everyone deserves to feel special on their birthday. The same thing happened to me at my work. We all get to pick our own birthday cakes and if there was any leftover cake, we could take it home. One year, a girl was hired who had the same birthday as me. That year, I had to settle for a cake I didn't like and she got the leftover cake! I was so happy when she quit a few months later.
