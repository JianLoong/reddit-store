Holly has always been a Disney girlie, and I wasn\u2019t surprised when she told me and the other bridesmaids she wanted us to dress as Disney princesses. Holly is going to wear a huge, glittery, glammed up ballgown, and we\u2019ll be in dresses that are more of a modern take on the princess\u2019s dresses, but there will be text on the invite stating which bridesmaid is which princess and which groom is which prince.\n\nThere are five of us, and she wants us each in a different color, so she has chosen Ariel (pink), Cinderella (blue), Belle (yellow), Rapunzel (purple), and Tiana (green). She picked who would be who for us, and told me that she wants me as Tiana since I have black hair. The problem is, I\u2019m white. The entire bridal party is white. You can see why I\u2019m not feeling this choice.\n\nI brought it up privately with Holly and tried to suggest alternatives for green (Merida from Brave or Anna from Frozen) but she shot them down (Merida\u2019s dress is \u201cactually blue\u201d + she has no prince, and she doesn\u2019t like Frozen). I told Holly that I will not be Tiana for her wedding and that I\u2019m stepping down unless she accepts one of the alternatives or provides another. She called me a b**ch and a terrible friend and said nobody is going to care. I told her that I care, and I\u2019m not doing it.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten some Facebook messages from some of her family/friends asking why I\u2019m being so difficult and why I\u2019m trying to ruin Holly\u2019s wedding, and even a couple of the bridesmaids have told me to just \u201csuck it up\u201d because I\u2019m throwing Holly\u2019s plan out of whack. I\u2019m standing my ground on this, but the pushback kind of has me wondering if I\u2019m making something out of nothing. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Bride only asked me to get a tan. Nowhere did I comment saying she asked everyone. Even if I had done so and deleted the comment, someone in this thread would still be able to find it, or at least the [deleted] marker in one of the comment threads. \u270c\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1696098236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wdyyh/aita_for_saying_no_to_dressing_as_a_disney/", "score": 4110, "replies": ["I don\u2019t think anyone would be offended if you were dressed as Tiana\u2014or a modern take on Tiana\u2014unless you wore blackface.

And her reaction to you being uncomfortable  and asking you to get a tan are out of line.\n\nIt's late for this idea as you've already stepped out, but I'm for the idea she should let y'all pick the names of the princesses she likes from a bag (I agree a lil weird to not like Frozen, but to each their own.)

The bridezillas all come out of the woodwork to defend any ridiculous whim of a bride and why you should suck it up.\n\nThe fact that you are uncomfortable dressing up as a black character should be enough for her to rethink.  And if she were a true friend, she would dress you up as someone else.  Or even do something completely wacky and just dress you like a generic princess of unknown origin in some dress.  Like the guest list isn't going to care at all.\n\nMaybe you dodged a bullet.  She sounds like she wants the wedding of every 6 year old's dreams.  A bride can have her (weird) vision while still honoring the comfort level of her wedding party.  Handling this better would have been a group discussion of her preferences and the bridesmaids preferences assuming they are paying for their own dresses, etc.", "If it's okay for black girls to dress up as Merida, Rapunzel or any other Disney princess then I don't see what's wrong about you wearing a dress that is ONLY alluding to Tiana in its colour.\n\nEDIT: Kinda YTA for making this about race when it really shouldn't matter.", "NTA.

Aurora on the other hand, is usually in pink.  Seems like an easy fix to me! But if she wants a black-haired princess - what about Snow White? Jasmine maybe?  (but now we've got Arab instead of black, so I don't know if that's better) Mulan has the same issue, though she does wear green!\n\nHonestly, you're uncomfortable with it because it feels too close to blackface for you, and I understand.  If she doesn't understand and refuses to budge, well...not much else for you to do.  \n\n\nETA:  I thought of another one: Vanellope Von Schweetz!

Tiana's story is super culturally specific to a time during American history when black people were heavily segregated, and this is a huge part of her story. I really feel like people would be singing a different tune if she had asked you to be Moana, Mulan, or Pocahontas... I do truly believe that anyone can dress up as these princesses and enjoy it, but there is also a level of gravity to some of these stories that just isn't as strong in, Cinderella, for example.

Okay. I\u2019d much rather people exercise a degree of care and caution before just jumping into this stuff. However, as long as you\u2019re just wearing a green dress styled after Tiana\u2019s, there\u2019s nothing racist about this. It\u2019d be another story if she wanted you to mimic textured hair or something, or especially if she wanted you to full-on do blackface. The dress alone has no racist implications- anyone can wear a sparkly green dress and be inspired by Tiana. Still, I think it\u2019s perfectly fine to just not want to.

I genuinely lean NAH because the bride wasn\u2019t asking her to don racially insensitive accents (such as a wig or dark face makeup), but Tiana\u2019s race is a relevant background to her story, and as such it might feel weird to cosplay that character as a white woman. Other commenters have said much more eloquently than I can that, for example, characters like Ariel don\u2019t have race as any sort of factor in their story. \n\nThe biggest issue is that the bride went nuclear and called her \u201cfriend\u201d a bitch at the first sign of opposition\u2014 that\u2019s an unnecessary reaction where they could have ideally talked it out.", "I'm actually shocked that the men all are going along with this absurdity.", "So, knee breeches, wasitcoats and stockings?

I am not saying I think it would necessarily be wrong for a white person to portray Tiana if it was respected in a certain way, but it is totally valid to not feel comfortable with this character specifically. It feels much different than a white person portraying Jasmine, because although Jasmine is Middle Eastern and that was a central part to the story, the history behind Tiana's time period and Black history in America is important.\n\nI just feel like this whole situation has some pretty simple solutions.

Anna is a great fit because of the green dress but I guess if the bride doesn\u2019t like Frozen, so be it. \n\nAnd I\u2019d disagree this is an example of \u201cplaying\u201d a black character.
