Maybe it was just a brain fart he had, but not cool at all", "I can see why you have 4 kids at such a young age.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd I may be jumping the gun, but I think you may be in an abusive relationship. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.", "NTA. You don't owe anyone access to your body.", "23 and you have four kids?  How long did you have after each birth before he pressured you into sex again?  \n  \nJesus NTA but your husband has issues with how he treats you.", "No.  He's being insensitive. Very insensitive and inconsiderate He's only thinking about what he wants and it's only been two weeks.", "NTA. Tell him to get snipped before you ever consider it again.", "NTA and taking all of the lack of support and emotional stuff out of this, I thought you were not supposed to have sex for at least two weeks have a miscarriage.  Now bring into it your grieving and emotional well being.", "NTA\n\nhe is incredibly cruel and insensitive.", "This would 100% be a divorce worthy comment for me\n\nI don't give ANY fucks\n\nI'm child free BY CHOICE as well as medical necessity and even I know better, and that that is not a line/a comment to ever cross/make \n\nWow\n\nNTA", "Nta that was insensitive and out of line his part", "NTA. Good lord.", "NTA My wife having a miscarriage is one of my worst nightmares and I would not dream of making such an insensitive comment, especially so soon. He should be grieving with you. You should be his partner, not his sex toy or his breeding stock. I\u2019m so sorry that this happened to you and I\u2019m sorry your husband values you so little that you need to go through this without him.", "NTA his comment was insensitive and h is only upset because he isn't getting any. I would tell him sorry my miscarriage is stopping your sex life, but you more then welcomed to come and be in pain both mentally emotionally and physically since he is desperately worried about sex.", "He\u2019s a walking red flag.", "NTA. He was being incredibly insensitive.", "NTA. But I'm going to say for free that you need therapy, and he's going to cheat (if not already) and blame you for his decision. I really hope that you have a plan away from this man, because you deserve better.", "NTA. When I had a miscarriage, I was instructed not to do anything sexual or even use a tampon for at least two weeks. The grief took longer than that to process. Your husband is being obscenely insensitive.", "NTA for snapping, NTA for not wanting to have sex for any reason.\n\nBut yeah some people are really bad at communicating, maybe this was a feeble attempt of him to talk about sex? And he though a tasteless joke would easy it up?", "I think YTA because you treat your uterus like a clown car", "YTA because you two haven't talked about it at all. You expect him to read your mind. He made an insensitive remark. You both are assholes to each other.", "YTA, by not talking to him about your fears and isolating him and then reacting to your anger immediately even though he didn\u2018t attack you. He communicated his needs and wants to know if and when things can be normal again (it obviously affected him in lesser extent or differently). I think it\u2018s ok though be be the asshole once in a while if you are going through difficult times, so don\u2018t beat yourself up too much about it. I think you need a heart to heart discussion on why you feel so protective at the moment. A partner is there to help you through difficult times as a team.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m assuming at 2 weeks out from the loss you are still bleeding, likely heavily. Your body is healing and your uterus needs a break. You\u2019re also more fertile post birth or loss of pregnancy. Your husband needs to pump the breaks. If he is working 12 hour shifts and is too busy to help out then he needs to focus on prioritizing more effectively and sexual intimacy can be put on the back burner for right now.", "Nta. I can't believe your husband right now. You are dealing with a miscarriage and doing work around the house all day and your husband is worried about when y'all are gonna have sex again.

Birth control is a thing.", "Then prioritize, bc you are on a pace for disaster. I\u2019m trying to imagine you separated and each responsible for the 4 human beings you chose to create. At 23, you still have the energy of youth, but add in any more kids and a few years. And this goes downhill fast. \n\nAlso, at 23, you probably both have high sex drives, so I\u2019m not trying to criticize at all\u2014wanting sex at 3 months post birth (as you seem to have wanted), would be normal. If he coerced you at that point as he is TRYING TO DO NOW, then you are in an abusive relationship. A true partner takes it in stride if the other doesn\u2019t want sex. I\u2019m rather concerned for you, given how incredibly ignorant and selfish he seems.\n\nNTA.", "Everyone knows couples need to talk with each other.
