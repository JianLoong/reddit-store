The perpetrator knows that they're not telling the truth. It's all about gaining control over the victim by making them doubt themselves.\n\nThe more unsure the victim is of themselves, the more the perpetrator can abuse them without a fight.\n\nIt's why it's not acceptable even over small things. No one gives a shit whether someone ordered a coke or a beer, but it's not acceptable to make someone feel like they can't follow basic orders.", "I always have hated the \u201cnever\u201d part of that as malice can very much still happen and it seems naive I would change to \u201cDo not assume malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity\u201d", "That is such a great quote!", "Roman's actually. It first came from a Roman poet about Narcissus.", "A mental illness that could be treated if people wouldn\u2019t throw it around so loosely, stigmatizing it even further", "I *absolutely* think he's being an asshole on purpose. You don't? No, it's not the same as my ex-husband gently, kindly convincing me he was so worried about my mental health when I found evidence of his cheating and making me seriously doubt my own ability to correctly perceive what was going on around me. It still fits the definition.", "Same. I also hate how it presents it as a binary. Sometimes it is neither stupidity nor malice. Sometimes it is just random. Sometimes it is an unpleasant compromise. I also think indifference and/or selfishness are distinct from malice. Malice, to me, implies that the suffering is the goal. Not merely an unintended consequence or side effect of decisions made with other motives. \n\nFraming it as a binary like that makes it seem reasonable. Like yeah... it probably isn't mustache twirling villainy. But why then should I assume that it is stupidity?", "Aha, apologies, will amend.", "People don't throw around the term 'NPD' though - i.e. the mental illness.\n\nThey confuse 'narcissism' *for* the mental illness, NPD, but 'narcissism' isn't the same as NPD. Narcissism is just a plain descriptive term and not a mental illness at all. NPD is the mental illness. And people don't tend to throw around the term 'NPD'.\n\nThey do, *very accurately* use the word 'narcissist' for someone who is staggeringly self-centred. It's an old term that means someone who is very self-centred, and is not, itself, a mental illness, unlike NPD which is.", "This is one of my favourites. So many petty disagreements have begun because of me saying this lol", "Oh no you\u2019re completely right, im terrible at wording things", "You're very welcome!
