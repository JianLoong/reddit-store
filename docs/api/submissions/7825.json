We have 2 children who were both under 10 years old when the divorce occurred and both are now adults in their late twenties and early thirties. My current wife has a daughter with a previous man whom she or my daughter are no longer in contact with. It is important to know none of my children interact with each other (besides my biological with each other of course) not even when they were children and had the typical kids parties-they of course know of each other and have met but there is no relationship there. When my ex-wife and I divorced I moved to a different city more or less 3 hours away and would make the trip back to visit my children at least 3 times a week as they got older the trips became less frequent and when they were old enough to drive sometimes they would make the drive. A few years later I met my beautiful wife and her daughter who at the time was 3 years old needless to say she is my daughter and treat her as if she too was biologically mine. \n\nNow enough backstory. My daughter (T)(from my first marriage is getting married soon and my other daughter (G)(from my second marriage) is getting married a day after. Same month and year. Neither one did it on purpose as I mentioned there is no relationship between either it is simply and unfortunate coincidence. G has asked me to walk her down the aisle since she considers me her biological father as I consider her my biological daughter of course I said yes. I am simply a guest at Ts\u2019 wedding and there is nothing wrong with that she has decided her brother will walk her down the aisle and again there is nothing wrong with that. I let T know I\u2019d happily attend her wedding but wouldn\u2019t be able to stay for the after or the next day celebrations which soon caused chaos. She let me know she didn\u2019t appreciate me choosing my \u201cstep\u201d daughter over my \u201creal\u201d daughter which upset me. I let her know G is as much my real daughter as she is but she let me know her dislike towards that. I was given an ultimatum by basically the whole side of her family to either stay for everything or not go at all. As you can probably assume I\u2019ve decided to not go- of course not before trying to find a compromise but to no avail. \n\nI am not regretting my choice but now I am not so sure seeing everyone different reactions.\n\nEDIT: I hope this clears some confusion. I am attending T\u2019s ceremony and the reception. I am not attending the after party after the reception that can go on from 1-6 in the morning. I am also not attending the next day celebrations where close family and friends spend majority of the day in a designated home eating and celebrating. Nor am I attending the third day where family gets together to see the new couple off before they go to their honeymoon.\n\nEDIT 2: T is getting married on Friday and the ceremony starts at 3 in the afternoon. I will be leaving my house early morning around 6:30-7 the latest to beat traffic and spend time with my son while my daughter gets ready. The reception starts aT 4:30 in the afternoon which I will attend and leave until 1 in the morning which is when it ends. I will then drive back home which is another 3 hours. By the time I get home it will be 4 the morning more or less. G\u2019s wedding starts at 3 in the afternoon on Saturday but because I am a involved in this wedding I still have to be up early around 8 the latest get ready and my wife and I will take care of any last minute issues and to dos so my daughter and her fianc\u00e9e can spend the morning getting ready and enjoying their wedding day.", "created_utc": 1674200123, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gqs55/aita_for_not_attending_my_daughters_wedding/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps validly so, in that you moved 3 hours away post divorce when your daughter wasn\u2019t even 10. \n\n(*OP moved because his divorce was not amicable and wanted a change of scenery. Understandable, certainly.  That is not a justifiable excuse to a 10 year old.  He left because he wanted to.)\n\nBut, more importantly, I\u2019m gonna assume that had you been a larger part of your bio daughter\u2019s life, you would\u2019ve known the date of her wedding conflicted with your step daughter\u2019s and, I dunno, said something before it was set?\n\n(*Admittedly a bad argument. My overarching point was supposed to be that he had no notice or involvement in the wedding prior to receiving an invite.  That alone signals to me that there is a very strained relationship between the two.)\n\nI don\u2019t think your daughter is acting entirely reasonably \u2014 ultimatums like that (attend the whole ceremony or none!) are a tad unreasonable on their face \u2014 but between her brother walking her down the aisle, your emphasis on participating in your step daughter\u2019s wedding, and the above: YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s the only answer that explains this story.\n\n(*Honorable shoutout to the dude who said he\u2019d divorce me for this comment)", "AITA for not attending my daughters wedding\n\n> as they got older the trips became less frequent and when they were old enough to drive sometimes they would make the drive. \n\nSo as they got older, the burden to spend time and have a relationship fell to them.

YTA", "I just don\u2019t think there is enough information to really make a judgment. Why do you have to so promptly after T\u2019s wedding? It doesn\u2019t seem to have anything to do with G\u2019s wedding timing wise unless I\u2019m missing something. \n\nI\u2019ll be honest, T probably feels like you replaced her with G. G got all of your time since I\u2019m assuming G lived with you and your wife full time. It sucks having divorced parents and having your Dad move away from you. My Dad did the same and I feel abandoned. Then he got a new wife and a new life. Even when I visited him I felt like a guest in their home. There is just probably a lot of resentment and it was amplified knowing you would be playing an important roll in G\u2019s wedding and staying for the whole thing vs bouncing out early on T\u2019s.", "The math doesn\u2019t really add up here. You say your older children were \u201cunder 10\u201d when you got divorced and you married a woman with a 3 year old a \u201cfew years later\u201d. So it didn\u2019t seem crazy that your older kids didn\u2019t really spend any time with your younger daughter as the age gap seemed very big but your older kids are now \u201clate twenties early thirties\u201d. You don\u2019t mention how old your younger daughter is now but she\u2019s old enough to marry so that age gap can\u2019t be as large as it sounded initially. Why were your older children never at your house? My suspicion is that you visited your older kids \u201cat least 3 times a week\u201d once or twice and then it was very sporadic.\n\nI\u2019m going to say YTA because I think you very much did choose your new family over your older children, but you made that choice years ago and you and your children know it.", "YTA", "YTA. This whole situation has come about because you replaced your first kids with your second kid. You moved away when they were still young to get away from their mother. You admit you stopped seeing them as much; and they drove hours to visit you in their teens. You deprioritized them as literal kids. You being invited as a guest only to the older daughters wedding means she doesn't feel close to you, and it's obvious why. Yeah, you're a raging AH.\n\nYou're now saying woe is me, look at how hard I try to be fair and reasonable and how my older daughter is so unreasonable.

You did not even build a deep enough emotional connection with your bio child for her to be comfortable enough to share her happiness of being engaged or the trails during wedding planning. \n\nEssentially you are the mirror image of the absent dad of your step daughter in your own daughters life\u2026. Through your life choices you have caused a distance emotionally that will trigger extreme reactions from your daughter because she comes from a place of deep insecurity\u2026. And your actions or rather absence emotionally has caused it\u2026\n\nPs think deep- other than a tick on the box of the pre functionary dad list have you really been there for your bio children.

Your daughter has been feeling this way for a while. This is the straw that broke the camels back. You aren\u2019t putting more effort to be involved in your birth children.

You chose one over the other, so the daughter is understandably upset as this is just a replay of what she has experienced with you over the years. Being present at the ceremony is not really the same thing as being present the whole wedding. Can\u2019t you at least stay for the whole first day? Is there no way you can make that work? Come on, there must be something you can do. Also, just because she offered an ultimatum doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept it. It seems like she badly wants a sign from you that you care, that you would be willing to go the extra mile for her, even when she is being difficult. This is, after all, what parenting entails sometimes and what she (seems to have) missed out on.\n\nEDIT. OP will stay for the ceremony and the reception until midnight. Still, I think he should do what he needs to do to be at that wedding, talk through this ultimatum and make peace with his daughter.

It's a dumb ultimatum and she's probably mostly pissed that you called her bluff.", "YTA. \nIt doesn't matter if you are a guest or walking the bride down the aisle. \nYou are choosing your second family over your first one AGAIN. \nDo you understand why you are just a guest at your daughter's wedding and her brother is walking her? \n\nYeah, it's hard with children and second families, but the bottom line is that you failed her once, and now you're failing her again. \n\nYour compromise was okay, but I definitely understand your oldest daughter for her reaction. \n\"Can you hurry up the ceremony, I need to leave because my daughter is getting married.\" \n\nYou have broken something in her a long time ago that you need to fix before she goes NC with you.", "YTA.

Not that that's your decision anyway.\n\nEither way, NTA. You said early what you'd be able to commit to and tbh the day after celebrations aren't even really part of the wedding anyway.

It's incredibly unfair of her to expect you to miss G's wedding in order to turn her wedding into a 2-day celebration.\n\nThat being said: having a parent choose to move away after a divorce is a very impactful thing for a child. Whatever your reason was for moving away (and I'll assume you had a very good reason), you are implicitly telling your child that the other thing is a higher priority than they are. You moved for a job? The message is that your career is more important than your children. You moved to be closer to other family members or friends? The message is that those people are more important to you than your children are.\n\nSo you were facing an uphill battle in maintaining your relationship with your children... It's doable, but it's not easy. Multiple visits per week sound nice in theory, but where did you actually go if you didn't live in that town anymore? Because I'll tell you, dinner with Daddy in a restaurant a few times a week is no substitute for having a bedroom in Daddy's house where he can read you a story before bed and knowing you'll eat breakfast in the kitchen together in the morning.\n\nAnd then you got remarried. Your visits to your children became \"less frequent\" at around the same time and 6-hour round trip drives are a *lot* to ask of relatively new drivers. At the same time, you had a replacement child who *did* get to live with you.\n\nIt's no wonder that your daughter felt like she'd been replaced. You didn't even go to the trouble of making sure she had a relationship with her step sister! I'm sure this was largely a function of the distance and the fact that the kids never lived in the same household, but again, those are a result of *your* choices. If you'd made different choices, they probably would be invited to each other's weddings, so this conflict never would have materialized.\n\nESH. T for her ultimatum.

But the reason the wedding overlaps is maybe not because your bio daughter and stepdaughter are not close enough, but maybe because you are not close enough with your bio daughter.   \n\n\nI may be wrong.  But of course, G easily ask you to walk her down the aisle when you live with her for 24hr longer than you live with T.

I would have shown for the wedding and then left. Bride be damned.", "NTA. People here saying he abandoned his children are not reading the part where he said he drove a 6 hour round trip 3 times a week and it became less often when they got older, hell divorced parents who actually live in the same city don't go see their children as much. Relationships and communication are a two way street if they didnt want to keep that relationship going as much as he did, its not his fault.\nHis step daughter told him about the wedding date before the invitations were sent and wants him to walk her down the aisle not that it should affect his decision on which wedding to attend but keep this for late. His bio daughter on the other hand never told him about the wedding until the invitations were sent so he knew about it later and just invited him as a guest. Timing was unfortunate but he cant control it, he offered a compromise to his bio daughter but she didn't take it and went straight to an ultimatum straight away and he's not missing the ceremony or the reception which are the two most important parts of the wedding as far as I know, he's missing the two days after the wedding which sounds ridiculous on its own to have a 3 day wedding but to each their own. They didn't communicate with him properly and didn't take him on the compromise and decided to make him choose between his step daughter and his bio daughters wedding so they were basically telling him to miss his step daughters wedding in favor of bio daughters wedding, don't you see how ridiculous that is?

We have 2 children who were both under 10 years old when the divorce occurred and both are now adults in their late twenties and early thirties. My current wife has a daughter with a previous man whom she or my daughter are no longer in contact with. It is important to know none of my children interact with each other (besides my biological with each other of course) not even when they were children and had the typical kids parties-they of course know of each other and have met but there is no relationship there. When my ex-wife and I divorced I moved to a different city more or less 3 hours away and would make the trip back to visit my children at least 3 times a week as they got older the trips became less frequent and when they were old enough to drive sometimes they would make the drive. A few years later I met my beautiful wife and her daughter who at the time was 3 years old needless to say she is my daughter and treat her as if she too was biologically mine. \n\nNow enough backstory. My daughter (T)(from my first marriage is getting married soon and my other daughter (G)(from my second marriage) is getting married a day after. Same month and year. Neither one did it on purpose as I mentioned there is no relationship between either it is simply and unfortunate coincidence. G has asked me to walk her down the aisle since she considers me her biological father as I consider her my biological daughter of course I said yes. I am simply a guest at Ts\u2019 wedding and there is nothing wrong with that she has decided her brother will walk her down the aisle and again there is nothing wrong with that. I let T know I\u2019d happily attend her wedding but wouldn\u2019t be able to stay for the after or the next day celebrations which soon caused chaos. She let me know she didn\u2019t appreciate me choosing my \u201cstep\u201d daughter over my \u201creal\u201d daughter which upset me. I let her know G is as much my real daughter as she is but she let me know her dislike towards that. I was given an ultimatum by basically the whole side of her family to either stay for everything or not go at all.

I know you've told yourself that not missing recitals, etc., means you've been a good father, but you haven't been a father at all. You have had, at best, a surface relationship. You have kept your life hidden from her, and chosen to keep your new family close to your heart while not even trying to be close to your older children or taking into account the damage you have caused them by not fully involving them in your life, and being fully involved in theirs.\n\nI assume you didn't want to deal with the hassle of blending families, but now you know that you've made the situation worse. Your daughter will never feel important to you because you have proven that she isn't.", "NTA - T is being completely unreasonable.

Your biological daughter also made the determination to not have you walk her down the aisle and yet you still agreed to go. You seem like a decent enough guy trying to make the best of a bad situation. Your biological daughter is wrong for making you choose when you were willing to attend the reception and ceremony. She also seems like she wants a fair degree of drama if she chose her brother over you to walk her down the aisle and is still making this ultimatum of you. A lot of men wouldn\u2019t even attend the ceremony were this slight to happen so you seem like a decent enough guy without an ego.\n\nMy only question is when the wedding dates were picked how close together were they picked? Like did one daughter wait and choose their date significantly after the other daughter.

It's unfortunate that your bio daughter doesn't appreciate that.", "NTA - you are making it work so you can be at both weddings. T didn\u2019t want you involved in the wedding and is treating you as just a guest but when things don\u2019t go her way, she pulls out the bio daughter card.

Bad divorce, moved 5 hours away to \u201cget out of the town she had bad memories in\u201d.  Look man, I\u2019m in my 30s.   I get it now.  \n\nBut I didn\u2019t get it when I was 10.  I didn\u2019t get it when I was 20.  \n\nYou moved three hours away from your family because you wanted to.  Again, I get it.  But YTA. Her feelings are entirely understandable", "I'm not triggered. My dad lived with me my whole childhood. He was shit and uninterested, and I wish my parents had broken up when I was a kid, but daddy abandonment issues are not my problem!\n\nI do think that abandonment is the feeling his daughter has, though. And whether she's right or wrong, the argument of \"I waited 2 years to move many hours away from them\" doesn't actually mean he didn't move far away, or that it affected his relationship with his children any less.", "I can see from your post and comments that you believe you didn't abandon your children. Your post highly indicates that your daughter disagrees. \n\nWhether or not you did abandon her is not an opinion I hold, nor am I debating it. I'm merely saying that \"i waited two years, I didn't run at the first chance I had\" is not an argument that helps. If anything it makes it sound like you put off getting as far away as you could, so you wouldn't seem like you were running far and fast (even if that's the opposite of true). \n\n\"I waited 2 years to move far away from my children\" had no bearing on how your children felt about it. \n\nSo you're going to the full wedding and reception, just not the after party or the events the next day/two?", "Being a part of their lives jn that way just isn\u2019t the same as being a fully involved parent. You know that and admit it elsewhere. Ultimately you deprived them of having the full experience of having a father for your own personal reasons. And you gave that to your stepdaughter instead.  You may believe you did enough, but you didn\u2019t do as much as you could have. You can\u2019t take that fact away and it\u2019s something that will affect your kids for the rest of their lives.  I think they understand you, they just don\u2019t think you\u2019re justified. And how could they? They were the ones who lost out.\n\nIf you were a full father you would be walking your bio daughter down the aisle. But you don\u2019t have that relationship because you chose to live far away.", "Why aren't you going to the third day celebration?", "You might as well just accept it now that your biological daughter will no longer want a relationship with you if you don\u2019t go to her wedding.", "I understand that. It is just unfortunate. I feel like you should do something to mend the situation, at least be present at the reception and try to reach out and work on the relationship with your daughter going forward. Not just accept this without a fight. I know she sounds unreasonable, but this is I think her way of telling you something. Behind anger is usually a lot of pain.", "I was responding  to the comment  above  that he is in fact attending  BOTH weddings with receptions , just not the after party the second day and going away gathering  on the 3rd. Did you actually  read my comment?", "I know this would be exhausting after an already hectic 2 days, but could you go back for the third day of T's wedding celebration? So you're there for days 1 and 3, but miss day 2 because of G's wedding? Again I know that would be an insane amount of driving and you will probably need a week to recover! But perhaps it would appease T slightly?", "It's missing a big part but he either had to choose to miss a reception or a ceremony. You think he should have chose to miss a ceremony instead? He was doing the best he could to be fair to both daughters and that wasn't good enough and she asked him to pick her OVER the other daughter instead of choosing to celebrate both.", "Well, but that\u2019s not what he said. He said he could go to both weddings, but he wouldn\u2019t be able to go to the extra events that was occurring for one daughter after the wedding. He said they were planned back to back and he could make it. \n\nThat\u2019s what makes it hard for me. I understand they were upset about him not going to the extra events, but it\u2019s truly sad that he chose not to go to the daughter who\u2019s wedding is first at all. \n\nI was not trying to suggest he not go to his stepchild\u2019s wedding. I think he should try to go to both.", "But why should they want to have you in their life ?", "Don't let anything keep you away from Ts wedding. She can get over you not being able to stay for the after party. You won't be the only older relative going home early. \n\nKeep talking to her, sounds like you two haven't been close enough for a while. I like the idea of going early to be with T before the wedding, that's special time with dad", "But presumably you talk to T and G. \n\nI never mentioned them talking to each other. There's no need if you talked to both your daughters. You really are an AH for causing this through NOT TALKING TO T\n\nEdit: to make myself clearer, you waited until dates were confirmed before communicating your dilemma to each. A loving father would have known and been involved in the discussion of both  daughters wedding dates.", "Remember he\u2019s just a guest I don\u2019t think they would have told him", "That's not the point I'm arguing - you said he could have had a word before the date was set.", "Don\u2019t a lot of people choose a venue and then work around their availability? So you have an idea of when you want to get married, but not a specific date? That\u2019s the impression I have from American sitcoms and films anyway\u2026\n\nWhere I live, you can\u2019t actually book a civil ceremony until 180 days before the date itself. So you have to pick a date, book and pay deposits on anything you need to do in advance\u2026and then exactly 180 days before the date you chose, go down to city hall early enough to make sure you can secure that date and venue before other people get it!", "100%", "Idk I just thought it would finish out the conversation.", "You are absolutely correct. Even though I know my reasonings unfortunately it is highly possible to my kids it will always be a case of dad left us and I hate that nobody will truly fully understand my reasonings no matter how much I defend them. \n\nYou are correct. I am attending both the \u201cI do\u201d and the party just not what comes after the party.", "Because the 3rd day \u201ccelebration\u201d is to see her and her fianc\u00e9 off at the airport and then go home. They are leaving in the morning. That means I would wake up early to beat traffic go to the airport and then drive another 3 hours again to go home. I wouldn\u2019t do that for G if she was the one that lived 3 hours away.", "bro, hes going to it, just not the after prty, he said that he will be  staying until 1 am", "He said that day three is literally just everyone seeing them off to their honeymoon at the airport and going home. That\u2019s a 6 hour round trip after two insanely hectic days to say goodbye for a few minutes.", ">but he either had to choose to miss a reception or a ceremony\n\nWhy? He never says that He actually has to miss the reception to attend the ceremony. He has to miss a brunch or whatever the next day, but not the reception. He is choosing not to attend that!", "The daughter and her side of the family told him that it was a choice between going to all three days (so missing his other daughter's wedding completely) or not going at all.\n\nHe *wanted* to just go to the first day and they said that he *wasn't allowed to*.", "There is nothing I can do to force myself in their lives. If they want to it will be on their own terms and I will do everything in my power to make sure they want me to be in their lives. I will also do the same for G.", "Fair enough, I argued that point poorly. \n\nI still think the overarching point that I stated \u2014 he had no involvement or notice \u2014 is the superseding issue.", "Definitely a popular one liner for this sub, fair enough.", "> I hate that nobody will truly fully understand my reasonings no matter how much I defend them. \n\nMaybe the issue (to your kids) is that you keep trying to defend your reasoning. Why do you think they don't understand your reasons? What were your reasons, and have you explained it to them since they were adults? If you have, it could well be that they *understand* your reasons, but understanding and accepting as correct are different things.", "I would not use the distance as an excuse at all with T since you are the one who moved away from them.", "He *was* going, he isn't any more.", ">I let T know I\u2019d happily attend her wedding but wouldn\u2019t be able to stay for the after\n\n?", "Well everything but going to the wedding", "But I don't get what made you think he made no involvement or notice?", "Yes. They're allowed to disagree with your reasons. Or think that they are stupid or selfish reasons.", "what", "That doesn't say \"I cannot attend the reception and also attend a different event the next day\". It says I told her I \"wouldn't\" be able to stay. Not couldn't, wouldn't.", "He offered that? Did you read the post? There are three parties involved. Two are willing to compromise and find a solution, one doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s sad but it\u2019s her decision.", "He replied in a comment that he had no notice or involvement until he got the invite\u2026 lol.", "\"As you can probably assume I\u2019ve decided to not go- of course not before trying to find a compromise but to no avail.\" It's in the post.", "I am attending the ceremony AND the reception. I am not attending the after party. The after party is not the reception that happens once the reception is over and the couple and guests want to continue the party which in my experience can last until 6-7 in their morning.", "Wouldn't be able to. Why would he miss the reception unless he had to. I mean, you could be right that he is just missing the reception because he doesn't want to go and of course in that case I would agree he's a massive asshole, but that doesn't make any sense to the story. The whole point is that he needs to get there for the other wedding and that's why he can't attend all of the one the previous day", "Ahhh.", "This makes a huge difference. Probably not to how much it has hurt your daughter, but definitely to my assumption that you are 100% choosing not to attend (as opposed to having no option to go to both). \n\nBut, to clarify, the events don't overlap, you just want to make sure you're well rested for the second wedding?", "He clarified in a comment to me that he is attending the reception, just not the after party after the reception. Which cleared everything up. It made no sense to me that he couldn't attend her reception at all, which is why it seemed like a choice."]}
