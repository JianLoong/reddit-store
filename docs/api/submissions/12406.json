{"id": 12406, "submission_id": "11sft85", "title": "AITA for telling off my SILs little sister because of her dress color?", "selftext": "I am a 43yo woman and my daughter, Genevieve, is 26. She was engaged to Richard, and I was thrilled to plan their wedding with her as a mother-daughter team.\n\nHowever, there was an issue with Richard's family, particularly his younger sister, Raylee (17) who had an 'alternative' style. Though I didn't make any comments, I wasn't impressed when we first met her, she showed up wearing a skull tank-top, ripped shorts, and fishnets at Christmas dinner. Despite this, Stan (13), Richard's younger brother, was fine.\n\nWe invited our closest family members and friends from church, as well as some close friends. Rich also invited a few of his close friends and his immediate family, some of whom served as his groomsmen. There was a conflict with Rich's father, who wanted to invite their aunt, but due to space constraints, we had to decline the request. Eventually, the conflict was resolved. Our lineup for the wedding included Stan as the ring bearer, Richard's close friend as the best man, and our other daughter Leilani as the maid of honor. And so, the conflict began.\n\nI suggested that Richard's family wear yellow in order to distinguish them from my own family. Initially, I had planned for my family to wear salmon, but since we had invited a large number of people, it became impractical. Consequently, we allowed our immediate family members to wear whatever they chose.\n\nDuring the rehearsal, I noticed that Raylee, Rich's younger sister, was not wearing yellow, as I had asked. I let it slide as it was not mandatory. However, on the day of the wedding, Raylee was wearing a tight tan dress, which shocked me. Her father and brother had on yellow blazers, and her mother was wearing a light yellow dress, so I was confused as to why Raylee was not wearing yellow. When I confronted her, she explained that she didn't have a yellow dress that fit her and that she was too busy to find one. Her mother had told her she could wear one of hers, but none fit. She wore the second closest color she could find.\n\nI was upset by this and told her that she had had months to find a dress and should have tried it on earlier. I accused her of being selfish and told her that this day was about Gen and Rich, not her. She became angry and accused me of being crazy for focusing on her dress color. We argued back and forth, and she brought up feeling excluded and not being in the rehearsal photos. I explained that it was mainly for the wedding party (she also wearing vans and a dress with alien emojis not very \"flattering\", if you ask me) She became angry, and her dad intervened. I asked them to leave, and they did.\n\nAfter the wedding, Gen told me that Rich was heartbroken that Ray wasn't there, as they were very close. I expressed my regret for her absence, but I explained that it was her tantrum that had upset me the most. I would have been willing to overlook the dress incident if she had handled it more maturely. Rich is giving me the cold shoulder and I'm unsure of what to do\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678929541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11sft85/aita_for_telling_off_my_sils_little_sister/", "score": 357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is your daughter's wedding, and her fiance's.  Not yours.  You don't get to dictate how she organizes it.\n2. It's ridiculous in any case for the clothing of guests who are not party of the wedding party to be dictated. The bridesmaids get coordinating bridesmaid's outfits, the groomsmen get coordinating suits, a flower girl or ring bearer get appropriate outfits.  Other guests just need to dress suitably.\n3. Expecting someone who is not in the wedding party to go out and spend their money on an outfit of a particular color is an unreasonable expectation.  They may not like or look good in that color!  It's a huge waste to have to buy an unflattering outfit you don't even like, just for one event.  \n4. You, as the mother of the bride, have no business kicking the groom's sister out of the wedding because you don't like her clothes.\n5. The sister is a minor.  It is the responsibility of her parents to provide such supervision over her clothing choices as they consider reasonable and appropriate.  Not you. If her parents considered her outfit appropriate for a wedding, you don't get to kick her out because you don't like it.\n6. You kicked your son-in-law's sister out of the wedding because she didn't comply with a rule you didn't apply to other wedding guests, including your own immediate family.   Why should the groom be punished by having his sister excluded because you didn't like the color of her dress, when you didn't make a fuss over the color of the clothing for anyone on your side of the family?\n\nCongratulations.  You ruined the wedding for your daughter and son-in-law.  Don't be surprised when they keep you far, far away from other important events in their lives.", "YTA are you aware it\u2019s not your wedding?", "YTA\n\nJust to be clear - you invited a large number of people to this wedding.  This included your family (which was quite a few people, too many to wear a single color), your church friends and your other friends.  Rich got to have a few close friends and his immediate family.  Even his aunt could not attend.\n\nThen you declared a family dress code.  That was inconvenient for your family, so they did not have to abide by it.  But Rich's family was required to do so.  Because you said so.\n\nYou took family photos at the rehearsal.  Which apparently you decided not to include Rich's SISTER in because they just were for the wedding party.  But, I;m willing to bet, included YOU, even though you are not a bridesmaid or a groomsman.  You are family.  JUST LIKE RICH'S SISTER.\n\nThen when Rich's sister did not wear the dress color you bizarrely ordered her to wear, you attempted to boot her from the wedding.  **\"I accused her of being selfish and told her that this day was about Gen and Rich, not her.\"**  I can't even wrap my head around the delusion running through your brain when you made this pronouncement, about a wedding that has been entirely about YOU.\n\nWhen this obviously upset the teenager and, in turn, her father - YOU BOOTED THE GROOM'S FATHER FROM THE WEDDING.  You kicked out TWO of Rich's close family members.... because a teenager did not wear what you totally bizarrely and inappropriately ordered her to wear.\n\nAnd now you are shocked that your son in law is upset with you??  For kicking HIS FATHER AND HIS SISTER out of HIS wedding.  Not YOUR wedding.  HIS wedding.\n\nLady. Yes, he hates you. He will continue to hate you.  He will likely never stop hating you.  And either he talks your wife into eventually cutting off contact with you, or your presence eventually leads to their divorce.  You are, without question, *that* MIL.

Get over yourself.", "**YTA** \\- Bigtime Momzilla.  You made it all about you.  You actually drove a member of the groom's family away over a reasonable dress color.

It is not her job to impress you.", ">I explained that it was her tantrum that had upset me the most\n\n*You* are the one who had a tantrum. She actually behaved quite maturely, given that you attacked her for wearing what sounds like a perfectly appropriate outfit in a perfectly appropriate color that just didn't happen to be the color *you* wanted.\n\nYour behavior was absolutely appalling.

First, this was NOT, let me repeat this, NOT your wedding. Helping is one thing but for you to dictate what everyone was entitled to wear is beyond ludicrous.

You obviously disliked this teenager from day one because she didn't fit your prudish sensibilities on proper attire.  If she had put on a $20,000 designer yellow gown, you would have attacked her for trying to outshine your, hopefully not as hateful as you, daughter.  Arguing with a teenager.  Yeesh.  Who's the immature b\\*\\*tch here? And really, was that your first and only time in a church?  Your absolute intolerance, as well as your behavior, would make one think so.  You owe that young woman an apology.  You owe her family an apology.  You owe your daughter an apology.", "YTA - she tried, she didn\u2019t need to follow your weird rules or go buy a new dress bridezilla.

Especially someone representing not your own family.\n\nEdit; crap didn\u2019t realize it was the MiL, ha ha even a bigger AH", "uh, YTA. are you sure you didn't think the wedding was about you? you sure acted like it. this poor girl didn't wear hot pink, she didn't throw a fit and show up in some other color to spite you. she wore tan because it was the closest thing she could find to yellow that fit her, and you kicked her out of her brother's wedding?! what is wrong with you?", "YTA, and a MILzilla.\nDress colors are for the bridal party, not the guests. You kicked out the groom's family over a dress. You *suggested* a certain color. Why, is beyond me...but as a *suggestion* it did not have to be followed. Matter of fact, you allowed *your* immediate family to wear whatever they chose. Well, the sister is the GROOM'S immediate family. And you expected a 17 year old to handle a situation \"maturely\"?\n\nThere are so many levels of YTA going on here in your self-absorbed, demanding, condescending attitude toward this entire wedding. A wedding which belonged to the groom as much as the bride - or should have. Your daughter may have been thrilled, but you ruined that wedding for your son-in-law.\n\nYou could start by apologizing. And I mean really apologizing. Not blaming your actions on anyone else. You chose your actions and you need to own them and the hurt they caused.", "Yta in 5 years the bride and groom would have forgotten that this girl wore tan, they\u2019ll remember the teenager getting yelled at for no reason though", "YTA, and frankly you sound a bit unhinged. It\u2019s silly to dictate that guests wear a particular color to a wedding and insane to remove the groom\u2019s family from his own wedding.\n\nI\u2019m sure your church friends (who were invited in lieu of actual family members, e.g. the aunt) were terribly impressed. Congratulations on ruining your daughter\u2019s wedding.", "YTA\n\nYou took the color requirement off of your side of the family and kept the yellow for his side.\n\nThen YOU caused a scene about a dress being tan. This is in you monster-in-law.", "YTA, you really thought you had the right to kick out the sister of the groom because of her dress color!?!? \n\nPosts like these make me so grateful for my parents and my in laws.", "YTA\n\nYou say you made a suggestion, you say it wasn't mandatory, then you threw a temper tantrum when your completely voluntarily and in no way obligatory suggestion wasn't followed to the letter.\n\nIt wasn't your place to dictate what people should wear to someone else's wedding.  It wasn't your place to throw anyone out of someone else's wedding.  \n\nYes, as  you said, the day should have been about Gen and Rich but you made it about you.  You did that, not someone whose dress wasn't yellow.\n\nI'm not sure how you can expect anyone to handle a situation like that maturely, in fact I think she gave it the level of maturity it deserved.", "YTA.\n\nDoing some quick maths, looks like you planned your daughter\u2019s wedding how you would want YOURS.  You didn\u2019t care at all about your son in law\u2019s feelings.  \n\nAs you\u2019ve mentioned church friends, I\u2019d like to congratulate you on being an exemplary Christian.  Good job!", "Wow. I\u2019ve never heard of colour coordinating guests at a wedding. It\u2019s\u2026 um\u2026 weird. People can just, I don\u2019t know, talk to each other and find out who invited who if that\u2019s important to them - and also yellow? Yellow?? I wouldn\u2019t wear anything that\u2019s yellow and I doubt I\u2019m alone in that, but even if it wasn\u2019t yellow, people have their own preferences in terms of the colour of their clothing.\n\nPeople are *not* props.

This wedding sounds awful.", "YTA.  I am so happy I wasn\u2019t invited to this wedding.  You needed to listen to your own advice.  The wedding was about your daughter and her husband.   It wasn\u2019t about you, although it sounds like you did your best to make it all your \u201cperfect day\u201d. I am surprised the grooms family bothered to show up.", "100% YTA this wasn't your wedding, you seem to think because you paid you had control. I feel embarrassed for your daughter. There's countless AITA post from brides who's parents are paying for their wedding and are massively overstepping so honestly I wouldn't be suprised if one of them was written by your daughter about you.", "YTA. Yellow is unflattering and impractical and no one needs to distinguish one family from another. It\u2019s a wedding. You\u2019re all one family now.", "YTA. \n\nYour son-in-law couldn't even have his aunt in attendance because of your large family, friends and people from church. I am sure kicking his sister out was the straw that broke the camel's back and you can be assured that you will never have a close relationship with him and likely not with your future grandchildren. Once your daughter has managed to sort herself out I would be surprised if she even wants a relationship with you. \n\nYou picked a fight with a kid because you don't like her style and tried to dictate what color the groom's family had to wear to the wedding.

How ridiculous can you be?", "YTA - you are the stereotypical tyrannical MIL that people joke about. Way to ruin the wedding for your daughter.

And my aren't you a peach.. This was Their wedding. If they had a problem with it, then they should have been the one to handle it.", "YTA. For someone who says the day is about your daughter as a reason to attack a kid, you sure made a lot about you and what you wanted. I think it\u2019s wildly selfish and inappropriate you acted that way towards a 17 year year old, especially for a wedding that was not your own.

You owe everyone an apology and you definitely earned the Crazy MIL badge!", "dude. you\u2019re judging her. you had your kid at 18, which means you were likely pregnant at 17. But let\u2019s trade someone for a color versus you know you being pregnant as a teenager\u2026. i give zero fs about the fact you had your kid young, but seriously, color of an outfit vs. your own teen pregnancy. YTA", "YTA. What is the purpose of a wedding? In Judeo-Christian circles, it is the belief that \"two shall become one\" and be extension, the two families become one. By trying to differentiate between the families, having different standards for them, etcetera you are creating a visual division in a ceremony that is all about coming together.\n\nTeenagers do things that adults often don't like or understand. This is universal and understood in most circles. Clothing is a common way teenagers use to \"find themselves\" and ultimately, it's harmless. The photos will be fond memories for all of that time in life when sister Suzy was a rebellious teenager, and wasn't it funny. \n\nYou, an adult woman, should have the maturity and self confidence to brush off her teenage antics that are harming no one. Honestly, I find it endearing and cute...she did try and executed pretty close. This isn't her wedding, but she clearly did try to follow the most ridiculous request ever.\n\nYou have also already created strife for your poor daughter in her marriage. She now has to navigate between you, her mother who is angry over something stupid and her husband and IL's legitimate anger over being ostracized from their son/brother's wedding. You son in law should come to the defense of his sister and should be angry at you.  He and your daughter probably had a huge fight over this. Good job mom for causing marital problems already.\n\nOn a practical level, all the photos of large family groups can be ordered in black and white. Who GAF over the color? \n\nThere are 1 of 2 ways this ends up if you don't change your behavior:\n1. Your daughter realizes you are toxic and chooses the family she made over you and cuts contact with you. You don't get to talk to her or any grandchildren.\n2. We'll be hearing from your SIL in a few years because they'll be getting a divorce because you kept interfering in their marriage and your daughter let you violate their marriage. Hopefully, there will be no children involved,  but you could be the reason your future grandchildren end up in a broken home.", "YTA and tacky as a turd.\n\nSalmon and yellow.\n\nIt would have looked like a vaginal infection.\n\nWhat a tacky sounding wedding", "Not only the AH, but a judgmental AH!

She was engaged to Richard, and I was thrilled to plan their wedding with her as a mother-daughter team.\n\nHowever, there was an issue with Richard's family, particularly his younger sister, Raylee (17) who had an 'alternative' style. Though I didn't make any comments, I wasn't impressed when we first met her, she showed up wearing a skull tank-top, ripped shorts, and fishnets at Christmas dinner. Despite this, Stan (13), Richard's younger brother, was fine.\n\nWe invited our closest family members and friends from church, as well as some close friends. Rich also invited a few of his close friends and his immediate family, some of whom served as his groomsmen. There was a conflict with Rich's father, who wanted to invite their aunt, but due to space constraints, we had to decline the request. Eventually, the conflict was resolved. Our lineup for the wedding included Stan as the ring bearer, Richard's close friend as the best man, and our other daughter Leilani as the maid of honor. And so, the conflict began.\n\nI suggested that Richard's family wear yellow in order to distinguish them from my own family. Initially, I had planned for my family to wear salmon, but since we had invited a large number of people, it became impractical. Consequently, we allowed our immediate family members to wear whatever they chose.\n\nDuring the rehearsal, I noticed that Raylee, Rich's younger sister, was not wearing yellow, as I had asked. I let it slide as it was not mandatory. However, on the day of the wedding, Raylee was wearing a tight tan dress, which shocked me. Her father and brother had on yellow blazers, and her mother was wearing a light yellow dress, so I was confused as to why Raylee was not wearing yellow. When I confronted her, she explained that she didn't have a yellow dress that fit her and that she was too busy to find one. Her mother had told her she could wear one of hers, but none fit. She wore the second closest color she could find.\n\nI was upset by this and told her that she had had months to find a dress and should have tried it on earlier. I accused her of being selfish and told her that this day was about Gen and Rich, not her. She became angry and accused me of being crazy for focusing on her dress color. We argued back and forth, and she brought up feeling excluded and not being in the rehearsal photos.

Why would you make people wear a certain color anyway?", "Millennials \ud83e\udd1d Gen X\n\n*Yeeting OP into the void*", "You are so unrefined it's not even funny.", "Was it *really* a suggestion or did you threaten to not pay for the wedding if she didn't go along with everything you wanted?", "Write better.", "\"Rules for thee, but not for me\" got it.", "Dude, you're so far up your own ass you can see out you mouth. Grow up and get over yourself", "Well why would OP want her own family looking like shit? Or piss, I guess.", "Maybe they were sold of lime green?", "Okay but why does it matter which \"family\" people belong to?", "Oh ffs you\u2019re religious makes so much sense why you can\u2019t handle her style.", "YTA. Just to be clear, the groom\u2019s aunt wasn\u2019t allowed to come so you could invite random people from your church who needed you all to wear specific colors so they knew which family was which? Checks out.", "Oh good lord, this isn't Double Dare. No one's going to score for the wrong team if they don't wear yellow.\n\nMy wedding had a lot of non-family members.

The horror!", "So your church friends could come but not the grooms literal aunt? Wtf", "So you felt it necessary to have an argument with a teenager in front of your church friends instead of showing some Grace?\n\nPlease, I'd love to know what religion you are?", "I bet jesus is very extra proud of you", "So the people from your church don\u2019t know they aren\u2019t related to you, and your family members don\u2019t know they aren\u2019t from your church?\n\nYou\u2019re just being silly, petty, whiny, and manipulative. Stop reaching so hard before you pull a muscle or something.", "But how will your undiscerning church friends know who your family is when you dropped the colour-coded requirement for them?

Why the hell does it matter if people from your church know who belongs to which family? YTA Your poor son in law.  I wonder if he knew what he was getting into....", "...

Every reply makes you sound like a bigger jerk.", "The usual practice at weddings is for people introducing themselves to ask, \u2018Bride or groom?\u2019 No weird dress codes requiring people to wear potentially unflattering colours. No being ungracious to your new in-laws. \n\nYou were domineering and unpleasant and you ruined the wedding for one of the two people who should have enjoyed it most.

Way to kick off a marriage!", "Even if it IS your wedding, requiring guests to wear a specific color is ridiculous. It's a great way to ensure you have fewer guests, though.", "Ding! Ding! Ding! Winner winner chicken dinner. Suspect momzilla used their money as a weapon.", "This is exactly what I was wondering!", "So religious that she had her daughter at 17. Okay sanctimonious teen mom \ud83d\ude44", "Probably so their church friends could know to avoid \u201cthose people\u201d", "Ah, but you see, she paid for the wedding, so she is the Wedding Autocrat who can deny entry to anyone, even the wedding couple!", "True.
