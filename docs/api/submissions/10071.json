Full disclosure, one was a lay-off during COVID, but regardless, I knew it was inevitably going to happen (multiple disagreements with his manager, constantly have to wake him up to go to work, constant complaining, etc)\n\nHe says he wasn\u2019t meant for a desk job so he\u2019s tried his hand at 4 different start-ups. All have failed, the latest one firing him the week of Christmas this past year. \n\nA few weeks after he lost his first job, he began depositing lump sums in our shared account once a month for 3 or so months and said they were paychecks for odd jobs he had been performing. But i come to find out they were payday loans. He had to go to court for not paying one back recently. He said he was forced to do that because I come from a privileged background. I had never felt more betrayed, but the compulsive lying had only just begun. \n\nHe abuses alcohol and adderall. Takes 60mg a day and easily runs out of his prescription. That\u2019s when he crashes. I will come home from work to find he hasn\u2019t left the bed all day or that he is drinking all day. We are members of a local club and he charged $700 in alcohol in December. I can see receipts and he would go anytime from 9 am to 3 pm. He says he would only have one drink and that\u2019s normal. When he received word that he was fired at end of December, I assume it was because he was at the bar and not working. \n\nHe now says he is depressed, which I believe. I encouraged him to go see someone about substance abuse so he is now on Zoloft. Still drinks alcohol and will say outlandish things to me. For the past four years, we were verbally abusive to one another but I\u2019ve just gone silent now.\n\nHe is a good father. And I do wonder if he\u2019s just had a string of bad luck with his jobs - but I also fully believe I\u2019m naive and have too much faith in him. \n\nWe have two small children so I\u2019m doing my best to keep the family intact for them, but I hit the wall this week and kicked him out. Said he could come back when he could pay his half of the mortgage. I can\u2019t have him living under the same roof and not contributing a cent to our family expenses/costs to live.

And I can guarantee you, as the child of an alcoholic parent with mental health issues, he is NOT a good father, your kids are just too young to notice yet. You might want to look into Al-Anon...", "Question, how is he a good father? He abuses substances and alcohol, takes payday loans with massive interest rates, lies to their mother and can't hold down a job?Make sure your finances are entirely separate and that he cannot take you - and his kids - down with him. NTA.", "NTA, and don't cut him slack.\n\nGood fathers don't put their family in the lurch, and they don't compulsively lie.", "NTA so many red flags here, love can be blind i know through experience but he needs to sort himself out and this maybe the only way to do it. If he tries to come back i would suggest rehab and counselling to him before you let him in.", "NTA. You drew your line. Now it's up to him whether he's ready to do the hard work of pulling his sh\\*t together. \"He's a good father,\" is generous of you because he is not currently a good example.", "NTA.  Active addicts are, by definition, not good parents.  Losing a bunch of jobs is only a symptom of the problem.  Cancel his tab at this club, give him an ultimatum about rehab (file for divorce otherwise), and move on.", "NTA \n\nHopefully it\u2019ll be the wake up call he needs but if not then hold your ground", "NTA - An unemployed, angry, and depressed man with multiple addictions and a lying compulsion is not a good father. It takes more to parent than simply loving your kids. Ditch this loser asap before he tanks your credit score with his poor decisions.", "Absolutely NTA, he's been warned many times and the situation sounds toxic af. Stand your ground, you're in the right. He needs to sort himself out for the good of the family as much as himself.", "I was going to say YTA for kicking him out for losing a job but that's not what is going on here.  NTA for kicking him out bc of addiction issues in a home with  children, that's understandable and I'd do the same to protect my kids.", "NTA \n\nMy dad is an alcoholic, and living in that environment destroys a child even if parents don\u2019t notice", "You are absolutely NTA. He\u2019s hurting himself and everyone around him, you were right to kick him out", "NTA - He might be an addict", "NTA.\n\nAnd he's not a good father.", "With all due respect...if your husband abuses alcohol and adderall, then he is not a good father\n\nHe is an irresponsible addict with a compulsive lying problem that doesn't want to work because it gets in the way of his addiction\n\nYou need to file for divorce and hope to god you aren't on the hook for those payday loans \n\nNTA", "He\u2019s an addict that can\u2019t keep a job to help support his family, that doesn\u2019t sound like a good father to me. He needs rehab asap and to get himself together, I would do more than kick him out.", "NTA\n\nActions have consequences.  You've let him repeatedly know and he has been unwilling to change his behavior.  From what you are describing, he also has a problem with addiction.  $700 a month in alcohol is a lot.  Even if you buy 50 or 100 dollar bottles.  More concerning is the adderall usage.  \"Easily runs out of his prescription\" is not a statement you ever want to hear  in the same sentence as adderall.  60 MG is a very high dosage.  Depending on which version of adderall he takes, it might be the highest dosage.  His amphetamine usage (which sounds like he is taking more than he was prescribed) would easily explain his adversarial relationships at his jobs. You also have it think about the safety of your children (as well as your own safety).  Addiction is a terrible beast but it shouldn't be at the expense of you and your childrens' well-being.", "An alcoholic Adderall addict is NOT a good father.\nOh he's a good father cause sometimes he plays with the kids--when he's high. YTA just for calling him a good father.", "Honestly my main concern would be the alcohol and prescription drug abuse around your children. He can\u2019t hold a job because of THOSE things. My next big concern would be the payday loans because those are extremely predatory and it sounds like he is tanking the family finances. If he is depressed then he needs therapy and support BUT if he is destroying your family and putting everyone at risk then you don\u2019t HAVE to stick around for it. He has to want to get better, you can\u2019t force it. \n\nINFO: Do you put pressure on him for material things (him saying he has to do this because of your privileged background)? How do you help with the finances of the household?\n\nEdited to add judgement: NTA", "Why do people say things like this? \"He's a good father but for his pill use and alcohol addition\".     Also, get your shit together, you said \"we were abusive\" to one another.   That must stop.", "Please stop enabling him and get yourself a therapist or an Al-anon group.  This man is NOT a good father and your kids are going to be scarred for life if you don't get yourself right at least.", "YTA as you only kicked him out for job situation and it gets job you take him back . If kicked him out for everything else the response would be the opposite \n\nThe real issue is the drug and alcohol addiction / substance abuse , the pay day loans and Lying \u2026 these things don\u2019t stop with obtaining a job and contributing to the mortgage", "NTA. YWBTA if you didn\u2019t kick him out. Substance abuse and that behaviour around children is unacceptable and very harmful.", "NTA. \"He is a wonderful father.\" He can't hold a job, he is a compulsive liar, he abuses drugs and alcohol, and he is abusive to you. He isn't a good dad. Rescind your invitation. He shouldn't return even if he gets a job.", "NTA, should have done it sooner. \n\nIt was Not a good atmosphere for raising kits!", "NTA - Lots of people will make a spouse leave upon learning of infidelity. Financial infidelity is a betrayal if trust. He wasn\u2019t acting in the best interest of the marriage, he was acting selfishly.", "I'm going to be down voted to hell but oh well \n\n\nESH. Him for being verbally abusive to you and you for being abusive back. Y'all are both toxic\n\n\nSlightly Y T A more because:\n\n 3 jobs in 7 years is not that much, especially if one of them is because of covid. heck I've had 3 jobs in the past 5 years and my bank account is quite healthy. 3 job doesn't mean anything.\n\n(Edit to add: ok I just saw the part about 4 start ups. I think that part is excessive and he should not be allowed to work for start up anymore. But I still stick to my point that kicking him out is still excessive)\n\n\nAnother thing is: He's only been fired since December. That's 1.5 months ago. It takes people much longer to find a job than 1.5 months. It took me 6 months to find another job from my last one that I quit. ( Side note: I'm SO thankful my partner isn't an a-hole who kicked me out for not having a job)\n\nFrom reading your post it also seems like you care more about money than him. He probably  took out a payday loan because he felt pressured to. He probably knew if he didn't give you money then you'd kick him out. Your relationship seems to be dependent on whether he can give you money or not and not whether you love him or not.", "NTA, good fathers figure out how to support their family and don't verbally abuse the children's mother.", "NTA - I would do the same.   His behavior is toxic and a bad example to the kids", "NTA - But your bar for what qualifies as a \u201cgood father\u201d is set way too low. Seriously, what are you measuring against? Hey, he doesn\u2019t hit or scream at the kids = good father? Or you left the kids alone with him for a couple hours, and they were still alive when you got home = good father?\n\nCome on. For a father to be even basic, at the very least, he should not do things that hurt his family. Taking drugs recreationally and not maintaining steady legal employment hurts his family. For a Father to be \u201cgood\u201d, the bar has to go higher. Your dude isn\u2019t even managing basic father with this shit.", "ESH. I was on the fence. But you\u2019re in a partnership. You picked your partner. He seems to have issues, but the way you phrased it that he can only come back if he can contribute financially makes it sound like you forgot the for better and for worse part. Yeah, sounds like he needs some work, but no warning, kicking him out like it\u2019s your place and he\u2019s a visitor makes YTA to me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
