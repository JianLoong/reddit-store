I've always been specific with the daycare staff about my child's nap schedule and needs and it's important for her health and happiness to have a consistent routine.\n\nMy child (let's call her Emma) has been attending the same daycare for a few months now. I noticed that her nap schedule was being disrupted and I couldn't figure out why. I suspected the daycare staff were not following my instructions properly. I decided to set up a meeting with the daycare director to discuss my concerns. During the meeting, I found out that the staff were not adhering to Emma's nap schedule and were instead trying to make all the children nap at the same time, regardless of their individual needs. I was furious and expressed my disappointment in the staff's lack of attention to my child's needs.\n\nNow, the daycare staff are mad at me and the director thinks I am overreacting. I feel that my child's well-being and development are being compromised and I am not being heard.\n\nNow the daycare staff are expecting an apology.

Over the years,  I've worked at a variety of schools and day cares and parents kill me. \n\nYou are reminding me of a parent whose son had celiacs and was lactose intolerant and therefore needed a specific meal plan. No problem,  we were more than happy to provide him with gluten free food and oat milk, as well as take the playdough out of the room since playdough has a wheat base and had caused a reaction in the past. No playdough in a prek classroom is sad,  but we did it to keep that kid safe. (Seriously,  look up the ingredients.)\n\nWell, the food provided by the program was not good enough for this parent, so you know what she wanted the teachers to do? The same minimum wage teachers whose kids qualified for the low-income pre-k their parents worked at?  \n\nShe wanted us - the teachers - to buy the food he liked instead. For the record,  we fed them breakfast,  lunch and a snack everyday,  five days a week. And she wanted the teachers to provide that food out of our own pockets. Thankfully our center supervisor laughed in her face.\n\nI hope the center director laughed in your face too. Do you really expect them to adhere to your schedule instead of the other way around? Depending on the size,  they could have 15 or more kids,  no way are they going to follow 15 schedules.

If you really wanted one catered to your needs, you should have homeschooled her or hire a babysitter for your child. \n\nAs a Pre-school Teacher working in one, the schedules we have are fixed. For example, in my school/daycare, our sleep schedule is from 1pm-3pm. ALL children regardless of age has to nap. It is a nice time for the children to take a break and rest halfway through their routines and learning activities  which the timings are also fixed. We cannot accomodate to a parent's selfish request unless it is regarding the child's dietary needs due to religion/allergies, or when a child is sick and we have to administer medicine according to the doctor's instructions.\n\nHope this opens up your narrow mindset.

That's ridiculous.\n\nI can assure you your child's development is not going to be affected by this change in the nap routine. She will be fine. My son was 16mo when he first started daycare and all the other kids were older than him and sleeping on mats while he was used to sleeping in a crib. It took a few weeks but in time he was napping with the other kids and everything was good. \n\nYour child isn't more important than any of the other children and the staff in charge of her care are presumably competent, educated individuals who are doing absolutely nothing wrong.

YTA, here's why... if Emma is an infant naps are on demand based on what the child is indicating they need. Infant care (up to 18 months approx) is pretty much all on demand. We get a schedule for feeding and sleeping and follow it to get an idea of when to expect a tired or hungry baby but ultimately it is the baby who tells us when they are tired or hungry. \n\nIf Emma is older than 18 months. Naps and feeding are no longer on demand... mostly.  We follow a classroom schedule based around when meals are. Naps typically occur after lunch.  It is not realistic to expect a class of 10 to 16 children (ratios dependent on state and age) to work around your child's nap schedule. If it's too early she isn't going to nap and you're going to be upset. And the other kids are (more than likely) will get woken up by her. She would potentially also miss a meal time. If it's too late she's either going to keep other kids up, get woken up too early, miss a meal, or (potentially, theres always 1) cause the other children to avoid napping because she isn't. \n\nDaycare might not be for you. I will say that most children, I feel, are much better off having the opportunities Daycare provides such as socialization, head start with independence, assistance with potty training, and general skills needed for when she starts school.

The reasons for this are:\n\n1. mealtimes. The entire location has to eat at the same time. That's the only way it can work. Usually the meals will be delivered from the youngest to the oldest children.\n2. Naptimes usually occur after lunch and the length of these naptimes vary by age group. Believe it or not, these are vital times for staff to prepare for afternoon activities. All the children in a class usually go down at the same time. Imagine if you have 15 kids in a class - sometimes more if there is sufficient staffing - and each one has his/her/their own naptime. It would be virtually impossible - the mats would take up space that active children need. Children would be moving around the child trying to sleep. The room would be bright and often loud.\n3. After lunch and nap, outside times usually occur. And those have to be done by age group. 2-3s should not be in same time as 4-5s. Imagine if you have school age kids coming in for their afternoon care! You can't have 2-3s out there with kids over 6. It is dangerous.\n\nWhat you are asking for is beyond difficult.
