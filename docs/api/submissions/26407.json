She\u2019s told me her timeline is that they\u2019ll start trying 1.5-2 years out. I\u2019ve never tried to influence her either way, but always supported her and helped her work through her thoughts.\n\nMeanwhile, my husband and I have been married 6 years and decided to start trying for kids last year. We didn\u2019t tell anyone simply because we wanted to keep it between us until we were pregnant. \n\nI\u2019m pregnant now, and told my sister a little over two weeks ago when I hit 12 weeks. Her response was a brief moment of excitement for me, then immediately afterwards she spent an hour asking me if she should try to get pregnant, too, and going through logistics of if/how they could make it work financially.\n\nIt was disappointing to not feel like she was truly excited for me, but instead for her to make the conversation about herself. For some reason, she became really fixated on the idea of wanting to be pregnant at the same time as me.

Your feelings are completely valid. \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with her desire to be pregnant at the same time as you, it would be really awesome for her, but yeah she may need to reign it in a little cause as you said, they aren\u2019t in a fabulous position just now", "YTA. There is a lot going on here, but the subtext is pretty clear. The fact you can't be happy for her says a lot.\n\nThink about it if the timing were a bit different... like, if she'd gotten pregnant 2 months before you. Would you have been happy for her? Of course you would've. And if not, YTA.\n\nBut let's say yes, you would've been happy for her... but now you're not, because it takes away some of your spotlight. YTA.\n\nAnd the fact that she (perhaps somewhat misguided but whatever) wants to be on this journey with you...  being pregnant at the same time isn't a competition; it sounds like she wants to do it to share a bonding experience with you.

YTA.\n\nLots of different scenarios here, but, tbh, you don't look very good in any of them.\n\nI'm sure you're going to get many \"NTA -- she's seeking attention\" posts, but they're wrong.

And even then, for all you know she did what you did & was trying but hadn\u2019t told you. There seems to be a lot going on that may not even be in your post.

You telling her you are pregnant simply brought forth the \"omg I want a baby so bad\" thought. It was already there, she wanted to have a baby but was holding off. So your announcement simply acted as a catalyst to ramp up the feelings already there.\n\nThis isn't her trying to make it about herself.

I think the clear distinction here is that she explicitly has voiced that she does not want to be pregnant for another 1.5-2 years. Her motivation in trying to get pregnant is quite literally only because I am pregnant- she said so herself. If she had asked me, \u201cdo you want to be pregnant at the same time?\u201d I might feel different.

And personally pregnancy is not a journey I want to share with anyone but my partner.", "It\u2019s not really about attention - I\u2019ve left some other comments explaining our relationship dynamic.

Reddit probably isn\u2019t the best place to seek advice, tbh, because there\u2019s so much background context that can\u2019t be explained here. The bottom line is that my sister has always been someone who takes more than she gives. Our relationship is draining for me to begin with, but this especially feels that way because of the way she\u2019s already been asking me for advice, info, etc on pregnancy without really checking in on how I am. Part of me maybe fears for what the future will hold given what my sister expects of me vs provides in a relationship. There are just some things she does that are hard to explain. A month ago she blew up on me and called me a horrible sister because I didn\u2019t text her back fast enough, for example. \n\nMy BIL and SIL are totally different.

She doesn\u2019t sound emotionally ready to take care of a child. Being pregnant and raising a child isn\u2019t a fad or something fun to do with your sister. They don\u2019t sound prepared to take of a child financially.", "Do not tell her any names you are thinking of.  Or nursery ideas.", "If she had/has all of these concerns, then she probably wants to be pregnant at the same time because she thinks if she is, then she can lean on you for support. There\u2019s the general fear she might have of being worried about being pregnant and thinking it will be easier if a friend is going through it too, for emotional support. But there are also practical things she may be hoping for; she\u2019d probably want to have the same doc if possible and try to schedule appointments at the same time, go shopping together and pick out stuff for her baby that \u201cit would just be easier to charge it together, right? And I\u2019ll just pay you back later\u2026\u201d, have a joint baby shower, drop the baby off because she needs a break, but never reciprocate because she\u2019s too tired from the extra stress of being less prepared for this, want you to provide free childcare if she does start working more\u2026", "Out of curiosity, does she consider you two to be close? I mean, does she think you\u2019re closer than you do? I know a lot of best friends want to be pregnant/raise kids together or have kids close in age to one another, and I know that there are also relationships that are kind of one-sided, where one person idolizes the other and tries to copycat what they do. Maybe she was thinking it would be a sort of bonding experience, for lack of a better way to put it, or maybe she just wants to do everything you do out of anxiety or obsession. I\u2019m happy for her, but I\u2019m also sad for you because it kind of sounds like you don\u2019t really get a whole lot of events or news to yourself, and it sounds like an annoying and exhausting relationship sometimes. I give you props for being infinitely more patient than I could ever be!!", "errrr. it\u2019s attention seeking \n\nit was done on purpose", "Hand me downs? You're optimistic. I was assuming she was going to expect OP to just buy everything twice so her baby can have nice new things too.", "Fucking same", "Tell her to get therapy ASAP and may she not be pregnant for the sake of the poor child. \n\nWouldn't hurt to breach the subject with her husband just in case he has no idea what she's doing or I hope he is at least with both feet on the freaking ground cause she sure as heck isn't", "She needs therapy and, if she really is pregnant, a nonjudgmental doctor, stat.", "I'm also getting the sense that she thinks having a child when you have one means that she can rope you into bearing some responsibility for childcare and maybe even mooch food, clothes, and supplies off you.\n\nIf she does end up getting pregnant now, you will have to watch for any overtures from her about mooching and politely but firmly shut them down. I can see you getting desperate calls from her about how she's out of formula or food or diapers, and you just *have* to help her out because of course you don't want your niece/nephew to suffer. /s", "Okay gotcha .... she feeling like she\u2019s falling behind in her life. Well that\u2019s got nothing to do with you. You need to just focus on you & your growing family. \n\nI totally get feeling annoyed but lots of people are pregnant at the same time. It won\u2019t change your pregnancy. You will both have different needs & wants. If you feel like it\u2019s going to turn in to some weird competition... just don\u2019t participate. Create some boundaries that work for you. \n\nHaving 3 sisters with 8 kids between us I can say that every woman experiences pregnancy differently. Some things are pretty common but neither of you will have the same experience. Both of you should just take care of yourselves & not worry about who has the best/worst pregnancy. The goal is having a healthy baby.\n\nNAH \u2014 wish you both the best\n\nedit add word", "NTA\n\nWHAT!!!", "Who paid for all of this?  Her or your parents", "Your second sentence changed my vote to YTA. It was the other one if this was simply a feeling (which you are entitled) and you weren\u2019t going to share it or display it to the rest of the family, sister included. \n\nYou are trying to make it sound like your sister is an attention seeker, when you, yourself will not be excited for her if she is pregnant because you want all the \u201cpregnant attention\u201d all to yourself for your decided amount of appropriate time?\n\nTry thinking of how cool it is to grow up with a same age cousin and how close they can be, and less about worrying that a party in your pregnant honor might be shared or less lavish. There\u2019s plenty of love for babies from family, and that\u2019s what matters.", "Why? \n\nIs it not possible for you to be happy for multiple things? Do you think that people have to plan their pregnancies around you?", "Tell her you didn't feel implantation cramps (not everyone does) even if you rid. This is just bizarro.", "Speaking from coincidental experience, one of my brothers has two children who are a few years older than my oldest and my other brother has two kids who are within weeks to months of each of my two. And it's really, really nice to have the latter. I hope your sister is hoping for a similar situation (minus the luck), but maybe try to focus on the experience your baby and nibling could have?", "If you\u2019re not close then it seems weird from that perspective. However if it\u2019s that kind of relationship it makes me think she looks up to you and maybe thinks you\u2019re close? Idk y\u2019all but some people don\u2019t take hints very well.\n\nEdited most of it because mom brain", "You aren\u2019t close, so maybe what you don\u2019t know is she was having trouble conceiving (and made up a waiting story) or she\u2019s scared of being pregnant, but thinks that if you are too she will have someone to talk to. Or since you hadn\u2019t discussed your plans of kids with her, maybe she made up the \u201cwaiting\u201d story because you have been married 6 years and maybe she thought you were having trouble conceiving. \n\nYou can\u2019t dictate when someone else tries for a child. \n\nAnd your thought that she should ask you first if YOU want to be pregnant at the same time? Are you the matron of conception permission for the family?", "It's interesting...I think we see this situation exactly the same; it's just we're interpreting it quite differently.\n\nSo she's said in the past she doesn't want to get pregnant for another 18 to 24 months... sounds good. Then she hears your pregnant and, interestingly, seeks your advice on how she could possibly make it work (financially) so you could both be pregnant at the same time.\n\nI've never been a woman and I've never had kids. But I have played many sports over the course of my life, and understand what competition, both individually and as part of a team, looks like.\n\nIf I'm a good tennis player and someone who's better than me says to me \"Hey, let's team up and play doubles and enter some tournaments\", I can look at it two ways. One of them would be so he can play along side me and, being better than me, would look good and I'd look bad. Or, he can see that as a team, perhaps it'd be a good fit. Sometimes , 1+1 can equal more than two. That's what being part of team is all about.\n\nAnd I guess, from the way she's handled thing, she wants to be part of a team... not compete against you. The way you're internalizing it sounds to me like someone wanting to be my tennis partner just so they can look better next to me, and me being pissed off that someone wants to take away the spotlight from my solo tennis career.\n\nShe didn't want to be pregnant, then you got pregnant, and she changed her mind. I'm sure we agree, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind... and she shouldn't be judged for that.\n\nAnd yes, 100% her motivation for getting pregnant now is because you are... and it's not convenient and it has financial ramifications, but she's willing to take a hit. Not because she's in competition with you, but because she sees it as 1+1 > 2.\n\nI'm curious... if she'd actually asked you that: \"Do you want to be pregnant at the same time\" -- what would you have answered? And what actual difference does it make? If you say no, she should derail her life? Let's say she decided to get pregnant now and then asked you that question and you said no. Do you think you should be able to control her life like that?\n\nYour final sentence; you're not that close. Well, maybe, just maybe, this is her way of trying to extend and olive branch to bring you both closer. Maybe being pregnant together brings you both much closer. It's as unique a bonding experience as you're going to get.\n\nThis is my \"bigger picture\" take on all of this. I realize on the surface it sounds pretty cut and dry, but I think there's more to it. Of course, I don't know either of you, but this is what I get out of it, reading between the lines.", "not weird but maybe she is scared in this process and wants her sister there. YTA, for automatically assuming she is doing this for attention. You look bad in every story no matter what you do. from your point of view, it seems like you want the spotlight on you and only you. Very selfish, If my gf was pregnant, and my brother asked if he wanted to go through experience with his wife, I would welcome it. Not even a second to decide that. And we are not close. So I still would find it weird that he would ask, but I would be welcoming regardless.", "Oh. I'm sorry, that must be hard for you.", "I think it may be as simple as: since she is older, she doesn't want anyone to have kids before she does.  (Is it just the two of you, or do you have other siblings?)", "Well, then how in the world will she handle motherhood? You can\u2019t call off on that. And if she doesn\u2019t work enough hours she\u2019ll lose FMLA", "Yikes- I can totally see where you're coming from. NTA and congratulations! Try to enjoy your pregnancy.", "Yea, I wonder if Sister just sees too many stories like this online. Like a \"Oh, it'd be so cool for our kids to have built in best friends in their cousins!\"", "Advanced maternal age is what my doctor used when I had mine in \u201821. Felt better to hear that than  \u2018geriatric\u2019 did lol", "Yeah, being *both* financially and emotionally unprepared for a kid just sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. And I'll bet money that sis is going to be looking to OP for help with both of those things - as if OP had nothing else to worry about.", "I also sensed \u201c\u201dShared\u201d birthday parties\u201d (Where you\u2019re paying for most of it)", "My dad paid for it, but the family ended up helping her cut costs by doing a lot ourselves. \n\nI did her makeup and took the photos (I\u2019m not a makeup artist but I do wedding photography on the side), family helped set up chairs/tables/decor, etc. I don\u2019t think she is someone who naturally realizes the cost/effort what she asks of other people. We had a bad childhood and all of us were kicked out of home by age 14. She got the most comfortable with asking favors of others to get by - I never did.", "Based on what OP said she is attention seeking\u2026 moved their pregnancy plans up 1.5 years to match OP. I really struggle with how they plan on taking care of this baby without income as well\u2026 just seems really poorly planned", "I\u2019d be happy for her eventually, I\u2019m just feeling emotional and hurt and would need a minute to gather myself.", "But her sister *is* planning her pregnancy around her, and its weird", "Did you just try to compare tandem pregnancies to tennis doubles\u2026?", "Can you imagine the sister's shit fit when OP's kid decides to have their own friends instead of spending all the time with their cousin?", "Yeah me and sister had a good laugh but it does sound bad. \ud83e\udd23", "Protect yourself with her having a baby.  She will want free daycare.  Most of all she sounds like the kind that will expect all of the clothes your baby outgrows.  Now is the time to start talking in front of her and other family members about consignment shops to sell the clothes to offset the new ones you will need.  Even if you do not just talk like you do."]}
