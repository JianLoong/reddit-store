It's something that helps me get through those long, tedious afternoons when hunger strikes. However, recently, I've encountered a situation that's been bothering me, and I need to know if I'm in the wrong here.\n\nAround three months ago, a new coworker, let's call him John (30M), joined our team. John seemed friendly at first, and we got along quite well. But there's been an issue that's been festering, and it's all about my snacks. \n\nI noticed that my snacks started disappearing. It wasn't just one or two here and there; it became a daily occurrence. At first, I thought I might have been mistaken, but then I noticed the telltale signs \u2013 empty wrappers in my trash bin and my snacks' unmistakable absence. \n\nI decided to confront John about it. I approached him politely, thinking maybe he didn't realize he was taking my snacks. I told him, \"Hey John, I've noticed my snacks have been disappearing from my drawer lately. Can you please not take them without asking?\" To my surprise, he just laughed it off and said, \"Oh, sorry, I thought they were for everyone to share!\"\n\nI was taken aback, but I let it slide, thinking maybe it was an honest mistake. However, the thefts continued. Every day, I'd open my drawer to find more of my snacks missing, and John was usually the first suspect. \n\nToday was the breaking point. I opened my drawer to find that my favorite bag of chips had vanished, and I had had enough. I went over to John's desk and told him, perhaps not as calmly as I should have, \"John, seriously, stop taking my snacks without asking. It's not cool.\" This time, he looked a bit offended and muttered something about it being no big deal.\n\nI was so frustrated that I didn't hold back and told him off in front of some of our colleagues. Now, John is visibly upset, and a few coworkers have mentioned that I might have overreacted. So, Reddit, AITA for speaking up about my stolen snacks, or did I handle this situation poorly?", "created_utc": 1694315401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ep5kt/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_stop_stealing_my/", "score": 331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
