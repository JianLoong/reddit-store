To be clear, the same branch as my husband, male 23. We have been together for 4 years 1 year dating 3 years married. We lived apart while dating and for the first year in marriage. This was due to us being in separate states. I in North Carolina him in South Carolina. He luckily transferred to a North Carolina station an hour and a half away from mine. We lived in a crammed studio apartment with two large dogs and a cat for the remainder of my tour (1 1/2 years to be exact). After my tour was finished and I got out of the military. We decided I would move into his mothers house and he would live on base during the week and drive to his moms on the weekends (2 1/2 hour drive one way). This was due to uncertainty in my job options (I had a few lined up and had offers but was still looking for a better option pay wise). We had a lot of bills to pay off and needed a cheap place to live, hence his moms and the station barracks. I ended up getting a decent paying job with his friends dads company. Fast forward a year we have payed off a lot of bills and my husband is discussing his next station. He wants to geo-bachelor (basically this means he will live in a different state than i) because he wants to spend our housing income on land and a house near his mom. So instead of buying a house or renting at his new station he will live in barracks while I live near his mom in South Carolina. Meaning I will not see him unless he takes time off. His reasoning is valid, if we do this, we will have a set destination (payed off) for when he retires from the military. But, As of right now I see him four-eight days out of the month which in some military family cases is a lot, I get that. But, I\u2019m ready to live with him in our own place, like a married couple (note this will be 14 years away from each other because that\u2019s when he can retire). After all this time being married we have had a studio apartment, barracks, and his moms house as our \u201chomes\u201d. I\u2019m tired of cramming all my stuff into one room and storage, I\u2019m very tired of living away from him already. I want a house but I don\u2019t want it to be away from him. He also doesn\u2019t want me to leave his friends dads company because it\u2019s growing and I have a good opportunity to move up in the ranks and get payed more. Just to note we don\u2019t have kids and he doesn\u2019t want to have kids till he retires from the military. Another note, he is insistent on doing this, I think he is just stuck on the idea of getting out and having a good home to begin his next career chapter but it is not considering the time apart. So, AITA for wanting my husband and I to live in the same house.", "created_utc": 1679068847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tv7d6/aita_for_wanting_to_move_into_a_house_with_my/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You do not seem aligned on this and being apart that much of the time over the next 14 years is bonkers. For comparison, in the last 14 years, my wife and I have seen each other physically, by a REALLY rough estimate 5000 days out of 5113 (give or take an extra leap year that I either added or didn't). By your highest count, you will see him \\~96 days a year for a grand total of 1344 days over the next 14. Lets go ahead and give you an extra week a year for some time off and we're at 1442. \n\nI am going to give you a hard NTA because his plan will have you basically put your world on hold for 14 years and then, when you finally get to live at home with him, your MIL will know you better than he will and you won't know each other. There is so much here that makes me worry that you're just waiting 14 years to have a divorce.", "Without passing judgement, are you guys sure you want to stay married?\n14 years apart is a really long time and obviously you don't want to do this for another day (let alone this amount of time), so you are not really on the same life stage/page/whatever.\n\n When you both categorically want different things, it's not a matter of AH or not, it's a matter of compatibility.", "NTA.  Your \"husband\" is thinking only of himself and his future, and not you or your needs.  It is unreasonable for him to expect you to live with his mother (if I read that right), without him, for 14 years!  \n\nHe's also asking you to start having children at 37!  This is also unreasonable.   I'm afraid you need to discuss this with him, that your expectations are reasonable, and if he wants it to be \"his way or the highway\" then \"highway\" is the option.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nThe cost to both of your quality of life is far too great for your husband's plan.  He's basically saying \"I don't mind if our entire married life sucks for 14 years.\"  And, by extension, your personal life will suck --- having everything in storage or living at your mom's house isn't how you want to spend the next 14 years, I assume.\n\nI think a reasonable compromise would be to do this for a few years, tops, to save his housing money for a sizeable down-payment for land or a house.  \n\nBut I think he's being an AH for being so rigid here.  He's so invested in Our Future that he's ignoring **both of your presents.**  It's asking far too much sacrifice for a future that may never happen.  Who knows what happens in the next 14 years, geopolitically or otherwise?  Will you both regret never living together if something major happens?", "NTA. It is reasonable to not want to spend 14 years apart. Go to couple\u2019s counseling if you can find the time. It think you\u2019d also be better off posting this to r/relationship_advice", "NTA\n\nI don't think husband is the AH, but what's the point of being married if you're literally spending less than a week a month together?  You're better off just being single and having an informal, long distance relationship.  \n\nAnd for the record - bless the military people, but this is why they have the highest divorce rate of pretty much any profession.  It simply doesn't work.\n\nYou two need to talk and decide if you value your marriage or money more, because very (very very) few people can stay married long distance multiple years.", "So at age 19 you married someone you had only known for a year, and only dated long distance? Why am I unsurprised that it turns out you're not compatible as life partners?\n\nYou made a poor choice, but NTA.\n\nIn every sense, you're young and free \u2014 no kids, no property, not even that much of a relationship. If you chose to, it would be relatively easy for you to course correct, walk away from the shitty situation you're in and start fresh.", "Ur not an asshole you guys just have different views. I\u2019d try to talk to him about it more in depth and see his side more", "I\u2019m sorry you are in this situation. Your wants and needs are just as important as your husbands. Wanting to have a happy home life where you live with your husband and raise children is a meaningful way to live your life, and surely not too much to ask.  His asking you to wait 14 years is selfish on his part. Bytheway, starting to have babies at 37 is not realistic - you may never have children if you wait that long.", "NTA and yikes. I understand you husband's grand plan, but it seems less than wise to bank on all that uncertainty. What if you wait until you are 37 to start a family only to find out one of you has fertility issues? What if you grow to hate your job? What if, after being set in your ways for 14 years+, you find you cannot stand living with him?  Too much can change in 14 years to wait that long to start your lives. The bigger issue is that you are done with the LTR (what other military families go through has no bearing on what YOU want for YOUR life). Imo you are wasting your youth waiting. I think you need counselling from an uninvolved party stat, bc right now y'all aren't even in the same library, let alone the same page, and you are both plenty young enough to start over if it comes to that. You will NOT feel that way at 37.", "NAH  \n\n\nYall both have valid wants. However, do know...people, humans? We have physical needs. You have needs. And you need to talk to him about those needs.", "NAH\n\nYou are both working towards a longer term goal that will see you very comfortable in life.  Unfortunately it seems that you are making a few too many compromises on the way there and its not really working out for you.\n\nFrom what you have posted I think you both need to consider that living under the same roof is non-negotiable and see what you can do from there.  The job may have great potential but its not as important as your marriage so he shouldn't pressure you into staying.  Also he could probably get a different post if he compromised a little there.  Either way your relationship is the most important thing and should come first so I think your position of wanting to live together is very important..", "NTA - I think you two need to explore more options.  There's no reason why you can't go with him to his next station.  As you know, the majority of military families move around a lot, it does not prevent them from buying a house and having children.  Or living in base housing together.  Your job makes it sticky, but the military has resources to help you with this.  \n\nThe part about him not wanting to have kids until he retires concerns me.  You'll both be 37 at that point.  Which is okay, but it's on the higher end of the age bracket for you.  I mean, you'll be 55-56 when your first child graduates from high school, and that's only IF you end up pregnant immediately after the retirement.", "NAH. A lot of times, people get married before they really know each other and discuss, \"how do you envision our life together?\" That is such an important talk. You two have very different visions of life together. If you love each other, you can make it work because love causes people to find compromises in difficult situations. You and your husband need to talk, *really* talk, about what both of you want in life and in your relationship. Discuss what's the most important to each of you; what will make you happy. See if a compromise can be made. I'll be honest. I would be concerned if my husband was okay with living away from me for fourteen years, no matter how wonderful his magical plan was. For me, *that* would be the main conversation that needed to be had before the house conversation. How is *he* okay with that much time important? Why even be married at that point? You're not sharing your lives, which is what marriage is about. If you're not spending time together and you're not sharing your lives together, then you're really just a marriage of convenience.", "NTA. This is completely unreasonable. He has this grand plan but he isn't considering you in his plan. No way you can make a marriage work spending 14 **YEARS** living separately. Not to be too graphic here, but what about intimacy? Really getting to know each other? Doing things together, strengthening your marriage and bond? What if his mom gets sick and needs 24/7 care? \n\nYou only dated for 1 year and have spent what seems like a good chunk of your marriage living separately. I wouldn't be able to do it. Married to someone I barely get to see, living with his mom and being generally miserable.", "This plan of his is not sustainable, and honestly makes me question his real commitment to you.  He is insisting you two live separately for 14 years?  Nope.  That reads like he married you for the money, not for love.  Also waiting another 14 years for kids reads to me like he either doesn't really want kids period, or doesn't want kids with you, but is too much of a chicken to tell you.  He knows if he tells you any of this you'll leave, and he loses the money.  You need to put your foot down.  Either you go together, as a married couple, and start your life together as it should have been, or you are filing for divorce.  Don't let him keep you waiting in the wings for him for 14 years.  You'll regret it, always.", "NTA, your feelings are valid, his idea does sound valid on the surface but I don't think he is thinking it all the way through that it will be 14 years of y'all being voluntarily apart plus the possibility of him being sent to other duty stations etc. I suggest marriage counseling/therapy to have a neutral party point this out to him and see how it goes. If he still doesn't see it, it maybe time to leave him where he is", "NAH You have different goals and wants. Marriage is finding a compromise.", "NTA, you're married and it's normal to live with your spouse. Waiting 14 years to live as a married couple is kind of crazy. Although, it does sound like a good plan if your husband was single.", "NTA. You both need to sit down and discuss your future and what each of you really wants. You may just be incompatible.  \n\nAnd how much money are you actually saving? He would only get a partial housing allowance being married but still living in the barracks.", "NAH. I encourage you to make the most practical decision you can when it comes to your finances. It doesn\u2019t sound like you guys have nearly enough money for a house right now, so maybe your bf is onto something.", "YTA. Your husband is meticulously thinking about and planning for your future so that you don't have worries a decade from now. I am 32F and have been with my partner since 17. I WISH he was mature enough to think like this. It will be a sacrifice but IMO very worth it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
