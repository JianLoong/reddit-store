She\u2019s smart, extremely precocious, and very funny. She\u2019s also, simply put, very unfortunate looking. Neither her parents are ugly, but she received the worst possible combination of their features. Maybe in time she\u2019ll grow into it with time, but currently, she is as I said, unfortunate looking.\n\nMy sister and her husband try to circumvent this by constantly calling her pretty, beautiful, gorgeous, etc. I get that every parent is going to see their kid that way, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to constantly praise her for beauty. Why? Kids are cruel, and they\u2019ll let her know she\u2019s not beautiful. So all praising her looks does is reinforce that beauty is something to be desired and praised for, all the while with her knowing she doesn\u2019t have it. It\u2019s much better imo to boost her self esteem off the many good traits she does have so she doesn\u2019t have to rely on looks for her confidence.\n\nMy sister and her husband don\u2019t seem to understand this or disagree with it, which fair enough, their call as parents. But they insist that I call her beautiful too, and I said no and explained why. I do praise her a lot for her intelligence, her sense of humor, etc.\n\nThey say that she *is* beautiful and I need to call her beautiful so she knows it, so I said bluntly that no, if we\u2019re being honest, she\u2019s ugly, and kids will let her know she\u2019s ugly, so bringing up beauty will only make her see it as something worthy of praise she doesn\u2019t have.\n\nMy sister started screaming at me for calling her daughter ugly. I know it can be a sensitive topic, but she\u2019s a grown adult, and I think she should be able to handle honesty on the subject. She thinks I\u2019m a huge AH, but I\u2019m just trying to be realistic and do what I think is best for my niece.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690214351, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158eo0b/aita_for_calling_my_8yearold_niece_ugly/", "score": 837, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Negative things strangers or acquaintances say holds less value when you have a vote of confidence from those you love and admire most. Calling her beautiful is not going to damage her. You\u2019re irrational, an asshole, and idiotic.", "YTA. Who do you think you are to decide whether she\u2019s ugly? Even if she is, her ugly is only on the outside. YOURS is inside, and that\u2019s far worse.", "Who defines beauty? With what definition are you calling her ugly? What parameters did u use? I surely would want to know.

And honestly, that had to be the most unattractive child I\u2019d ever laid eyes on.  Sweet, lovable child and very smart. But couldn\u2019t even be considered cute. Of course, all of us would rather have died from a million paper cuts than to ever have articulated that. Fast forward to when she was about 18. She \u201cgrew\u201d into her looks and is stunningly, traffic-stoppingly beautiful.  The transformation was astonishing. Don\u2019t judge your niece by her \u201ccover\u201d.

You're the ugly one. Your niece is not being \"damaged\" because her parents give her unconditional love and acceptance. I get that you don't agree and don't want to lie and say she's physically beautiful and that's fine. But insisting you're right and your sister is wrong just shows your immaturity. Your niece may turn out to be an \"ugly duckling\" and become a swan one day. I hope you outgrow your insistence on \"honesty\".  Your niece is beautiful inside right now, focus on that, unless you're so revolted just looking at her.", "On the outside chance that this is real, YTA and one of the biggest ones I've come across on here.  Seriously, what is wrong with you??", "YTA, so unnecessary to call a child ugly. If you have nothing good to say then don\u2019t say anything.", "YTA.  Beauty is 10000% subjective. There is no need to call a little girl ugly. Just because YOU don't consider her pretty, doesn't mean no one will. There is absolutely nothing wrong with raising her to love herself and her looks even if they are \"below average\". in fact, they SHOULD.

You are acting incredibly vain.", "YTA for calling your niece ugly to her parents. That was just mean.\n\nI do understand what you're getting at in regards to complimenting things such as her intelligence and sense of humor. I do agree that there shouldn't be focus on value of physical looks.", "YTA.\n\nas a twenty year old adult, you should know better. like come on. \n\nbeauty held to the traditional beauty standard isn't easy, for one. for two, she's EIGHT. why do you feel the need to call her ugly anyway?? \n\ni don't care if you think she's gonna be picked on. i doubt other's would pick on her. you're just cruel. \n\n you said yourself, it's their call as parents, yet you still felt the need to insert your opinion where it didn't belong.", "Yes huge YTA. There\u2019s nothing good, but a lot of harm, that can come from calling a child ugly. Even if your niece doesn\u2019t fall under the banner of traditionally pretty, there are surely some beautiful parts about her\u2014maybe her eye colour or her hair or maybe you can point out some non-physical quality like she has a kind personality or a good sense of humour or some other beautiful quality like creativity. My oldest child is beautiful from a traditional, physical perspective, but I always tell him that the most beautiful part of him is his beautiful, loving heart. There\u2019s *something* beautiful about every person. If you want to be a supportive uncle/person, it\u2019s part of your job to see the things that are beautiful about her.", "YTA. That\u2019s a literal child. Even if you do feel that way about her appearance (which I personally believe you shouldn\u2019t), there\u2019s no need for you to express it to anyone else.", "So what\u2019s calling her ugly going to do? Avoid her being bullied for it? Why is it so hard for you (an adult) to support your niece and uplift her no matter what? Quite the hill to die on.

Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.", "YTA....I can't believe you even have to ask.", "YTA. Beauty is subjective and it is never kind to say anybody is ugly. Telling children they are ugly is a surefire way to crush their self-esteem early so I sure hope your niece never hears your judgement of their appearance.", "Sure some kids are ugly, however beauty standard aren't universel. Also a beautiful person isn't pretty only by physical features.   \nWhat make someone beautiful for someone else isn't the same for everyone. So when you think someone isn't nice looking, someone else can truly think they are the most stunning person, and the other way around is also true.  \nA aesthetically pretty one can be repulsing because of a vile and nasty personality, and will look ugly even with perfect features.\n\nLove make the other one beautiful and attractive. Your sister and her husband most obviously love their daughter, for them she is beautiful and pretty for real. In fact she is in her own way.\n\nYou saying you objectively think your niece is ugly as not fitting some standard, can be taken as you not loving her. Your justifications aren't helping, as it sounds like you appreciate her and recognise her qualities, however can't find in you to love her due to her apparence. Doesn't means it's true, just so you understand how it can be taken, no matter how you explain caring for her, you without ambiguity declared you don't have love glasses for your niece.\n\nBtw you don't sound to healthy on the matters of apparences.

WTF is actually wrong with you?  How DARE you suggest that an 8 year old girl who is already going to be fighting society's beauty standards is \"unfortunate looking\".  Do you understand in that ugly little brain of yours that some children TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES BECAUSE OF THINGS LIKE THIS??? If I were your sister I would cut you and your ugly, hateful opinions out of my \"unfortunate looking\" child's life.  You must be **pretty damn insecure** to pick on an actual child.", "YTA. Come on, bud. This kinda situation is a reminder many neurodivergent statuses are massively undiagnosed in many places.", "YTA. who the fuck are you? do you not go outside? do you lack all social convention that clearly says it\u2019s not cool to tell a kid\u2019s parents that their kid is ugly? basement dweller behavior", "ESH. Her parents for demanding you call her beautiful and you for thinking that them calling her beautiful is a mistake. SMH. Sometimes all you got to do is agree to disagree. All the \u201cadults\u201d messed up here and unfortunately the poor baby girl is paying for it. Shame.", "YTA - you seem to expect a pat on the back for praising her abilities which is great and all, except you negate all of it when you make it seem like it\u2019s an either/or scenario. \nHow I imagine your thinking: \u201cif she was pretty then I would just praise that and not focus on her intelligence and humor because it\u2019s not necessary, but because I\u2019ve decided shes ugly, then we must avoid her looks at all possible and harp on other things\u201d \n\nNewsflash - even if you didn\u2019t say it to her face and she didn\u2019t hear it, she knows how you feel and she may hold it against you as she gains more autonomy", "YTA!!! Your poor niece. I was called ugly by everyone and even bullied for it. Worst part was that even my parents called me ugly. So even now, 30 years later I still think I'm ugly because no one called me beautiful. When even your family calls you ugly, it breaks you. At least your niece has parents who support he. Please change your mind about this: it could really damage your niece. She needs your support.", "YTA. Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder. What you might find as beautiful, someone else finds as ugly. I stick with you on not telling her she is beautiful constantly, but goodness.. She is a child. You don't have to call her ugly either.", "What an idiot. Please don\u2019t reproduce. YTA", "YTA and the worst aunt ever.  How could you be so superficial?", "NTA.\n\nEveryone who is going Y T A needs to read what I have to say.\n\nI was in the same position as your niece. Just a super unfortunate child. No deformities or the like, just a terrible combination. So my parents, like your niece's parents, did the same thing to me. I was beautiful, I was a princess, everyone was going to think I was so cute. And for a little while, yeah, I had some confidence. I never thought twice about it- why would my parents lie to me?\n\nThen, at some point in elementary, I was playing in an open area in my neighborhood, and a neighbor kid was walking through with a friend I've never seen before, and I heard the friend ask: \"Hey, who's that ugly girl?\" And the neighbor kid replied, \"Oh, that's just \\[My Name\\].\" No hesitation, he barely had to glance at the little group of 4-5 girls I was playing with, and knew it was me automatically. I was confused, and a little hurt, but mostly I just didn't understand yet. \n\nThings got worse from there. \n\nOne day a different pack of neighborhood girls I hadn't met yet waved me over while I was walking around, as 90s kids were oft to do, and I being the social little butterfly I was, trotted right up ready for some playtime. Then the ringleader girl pulled a face and said \"You looked better farther away.\" I distinctly remember them listing my freckles as one of the reasons for this assessment, and they didn't invite me to play. Didn't outright call me ugly, but made me very aware I was not on their level. I don't really remember what they looked like, but I do remember noting their clothing was more trendy than the kind of things my mom had me wearing. \n\nThen it started up at school. Maybe it had already started and I hadn't noticed, but I was noticing it now. I once did something nice for a boy (forgot his lunch, so I gave him half of mine), and he developed a crush on me, and was promptly teased into oblivion by the other boys so badly his parents switched him to the other class for our grade. \n\nI grew, it continued, and I lost my gregariousness. Not just from the bullying, but from my family still trying to reinforce this narrative that beauty was such an important trait while I became more and more aware it was a trait I did not have. \n\nAround the beginning of high school I grew resentful and angry about it. I was being lied to by my family, and to this day I have major hangups about being lied to. I started telling my mom to stop complimenting my looks, and she only laid off the barrage when I started full-out screaming at her to stop. Complete teenager tantrum, slammed doors and all. It was so bad that every time a friend tried to compliment me about something I would give them a hard \"Stop\"- I cold-shouldered friends for weeks if they kept trying to compliment me after I said to stop. I didn't want my friends lying to me, I didn't want to be reminded of what I didn't have. When prom came around, the popular joke for the boys to pull was to ask me to go with them- like not even pretending to be serious about it, just doing it in a straight-up mocking way to my face. They only quit it after I started telling their girlfriends and the actual girls they had asked out that they were asking me. In hindsight, should have just accepted to their face just to watch them panic about getting out of it.\n\nAround my early 20s I finally figured out how to help some of my shortcomings with makeup and fashion- still not a looker, but leaning hard into alternative fashion can make up for a lot. \n\nTo this day, the only person allowed to compliment me on my looks is my husband. He married this mess, he gets to think whatever he wants about it. \n\nSo, yes. Your niece's parents are doing her a huge disservice. They shouldn't be telling her she's ugly, but they should instead be focusing on the advantages she does have instead of trying to compensate for something she'll never be able to change.", "YTA. Not because you refuse to call her beautiful, but for your whole attitude about it. Not every kid out there is a cruel monster who\u2019s just going to pick on her for not being up to the standard that you think is \u201cbeautiful\u201d. \n\nBe kind to your niece!! Calling her ugly is just going to lower her self esteem (something that\u2019s awful to do to any kid)\u2026 and it\u2019s just a rude thing to say to anyone in general\u2026", "YTA. What\u2019s the point in calling her ugly. It\u2019s all very subjective anyway. Let the kid be a kid. Her parents will by definition perceive her as beautiful (it\u2019s how our brain works). You may find her ugly, good, just keep your fucking mouth shut and stop being a defensive asshole in this thread. You asked, we answered. YTA.", "YTA. Next!", "ESH. I don't think OP should have been quite so blunt to their niece's parents, but they pressed the issue by trying to control OP's speech. If we take OP's assessment of their nibling at face value, then I have to agree with OP's underlying logic, but if this *ever* gets back to your niece in anyway, it's going to devastate her.\n\nI think a better approach would have been to say something like \"Our society puts too much value on women's appearances and it starts in childhood. I refuse to be part of the problem.\" That has the benefit of being 1) True, 2) nothing personal. You could have gotten to the same place without bringing your niece's unfortunate looks into it.", "YTA, as you said she may mature/grow into it. \n\nI had a period of time in grade 6/7 where I just LOOKED awkward. Was a super cute kid up until then, and grew into a cute adult, but man was I awkward at that age. I was horribly bullied. My family including aunts/uncles kept my shredded sense of self together somewhat, and worked to build me back up during/after that time. \n\nThat is the uncle you need to be in the event she is getting bullied. Find the beauty in different aspects both physically, and internally. Those genuine comments will help her appreciate herself as a whole person. \n\nIt sounds like you really care about your niece, and want to look out for her. You might want to read up on child self image/esteem building.\n\nEDIT: spelling of a word", "ESH, but you win.\n\nI hate it, when the only compliments girls get are about their looks.\n\nCompliment her for being clever, brave, strong, creative, funny....\n\nStop obsessing about her looks!", "YTA- even if she\u2019s not conventionally beautiful, she is still a beautiful person since beauty is subjective. If she grows up feeling beautiful and confident, she will act it and reflect that.", "YTA.  Not for refusing to participate in the \"you're so beautiful\" fest, but for in fact judging a small child on her looks.  It's great to appreciate her for the qualities that in my opinion actually matter.  In my experience once we love someone and appreciate those attributes the looks are not important.  We no longer see what we would see if we were a stranger.  \n\nDon't call people ugly.  Not to their face, not behind their back, not to their parents.", "YTA but here's why. i get that you're not saying it to her face, but your job isn't to pick which subjective good traits you think apply to your niece, and praise her with them. your job is to build that little girl up with as much confidence as she possibly can get in *all* aspects, because other people will constantly be tearing her down and making her doubt herself.\n\nit is pretty universally known that confidence is attractive. not cockiness or being full of yourself, but confidence. any help in that regard from you will mean so much to her. don't hold back on it just because you don't personally think she's pretty right now. beauty is so much more than what people perceive as attractive at first glance.", "Look, we all know kids who are at an unfortunate phase. YTA for lacking the awareness to know it literally helps NOBODY when you call it out. Stop trying to tough-love your 8 year old niece.", "YTA. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.", "YTA.", "YTA.  And this is how you lose the sort of contact that you're used to having with their child.", "Dude she\u2019s an 8 year old so she\u2019s going to believe her parents and family\u2019s opinions over random kids. Build up her self confidence now so other kids won\u2019t phase her. I\u2019ll give you an example from my 9 year old stepbrother I overheard while visiting my dad for a night. \n\n\u201cShe called me ugly so I told uh-uh I\u2019m very handsome because my mommy told me so. She said my mommy lied so I said that my mommy didn\u2019t lie and told her that her face is ugly and looked like roxy poop\u201d (roxy is their dog)\n\nI paraphrased a bit and corrected some grammar but since he was already confident in himself random insults didn\u2019t phase him it just made him mad. I understand little girls are different than little boys but they\u2019re still kids regardless", "I actually don't know how to judge this tbh. \n\nI get what you're saying and I kinda agree. I have a younger cousin who wasn't necessarily ugly but her parents also acted the way your sister did, and for a long time she was confident and bubbly and just lived as a kid yunno? Then she went to primary school (elementary) and got bullied relentlessly. Ever since then, whenever someone tells her she's pretty or she looks cute today, she immediately shuts them down and says \u201cno I'm not\u201d and whenever her mom tried reassuring her saying \u201cdon't listen to those kids\u201d or \u201cyou're perfect the way you are\u201d she never believes it and once called her mom a liar for it. Now she's 14, antisocial, drowns herself in oversized clothing, hides in the back for pictures etc. It was very damaging to her as she grew up...so I get why you'd say what you said...I'm just conflicted because I feel it is mean, but maybe necessary?", "YTA. Some stories don\u2019t require a story. This is one of those stories.", "ESH - Even though your sister effectively backed you into a corner by demanding you call her daughter beautiful I don't think calling her ugly was the appropriate response. Just because something may be true doesn't mean you *have* to mention it and like another user already suggested, just because you don't think she's beautiful doesn't mean you have to say she's ugly. Sometimes you say more by what you don't say so if you continued to focus on her humour and intelligence while intentionally avoiding the subject of her appearance then I'm sure your sister would hopefully be able to pick up on what you're *not* saying. Just please, for the love of god, never tell your niece in person what you said to your sister.\n\nThat being said, it was pretty shitty of your sister to effectively demand that you tell her daughter things you don't personally agree with. Praising her humour, intelligence and other characteristics is going to help her build self-worth that isn't intrinsically linked to her physical appearance. Your sister would probably be better off if she was reminded that looks aren't the be all end all of human existence and her allegedly \"ugly\" daughter is still \"beautiful\" in ways that aren't tied to how she's perceived by others. Beauty is often highly subjective but positive character traits usually aren't. She could grow into the most gorgeous woman alive and there'd still be people thinking she's ugly but good people are good people, regardless of what they look like.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s smart, extremely precocious, and very funny. She\u2019s also, simply put, very unfortunate looking. Neither her parents are ugly, but she received the worst possible combination of their features. Maybe in time she\u2019ll grow into it with time, but currently, she is as I said, unfortunate looking.\n\nMy sister and her husband try to circumvent this by constantly calling her pretty, beautiful, gorgeous, etc. I get that every parent is going to see their kid that way, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to constantly praise her for beauty. Why? Kids are cruel, and they\u2019ll let her know she\u2019s not beautiful. So all praising her looks does is reinforce that beauty is something to be desired and praised for, all the while with her knowing she doesn\u2019t have it. It\u2019s much better imo to boost her self esteem off the many good traits she does have so she doesn\u2019t have to rely on looks for her confidence.\n\nMy sister and her husband don\u2019t seem to understand this or disagree with it, which fair enough, their call as parents. But they insist that I call her beautiful too, and I said no and explained why. I do praise her a lot for her intelligence, her sense of humor, etc.\n\nThey say that she *is* beautiful and I need to call her beautiful so she knows it, so I said bluntly that no, if we\u2019re being honest, she\u2019s ugly, and kids will let her know she\u2019s ugly, so bringing up beauty will only make her see it as something worthy of praise she doesn\u2019t have.\n\nMy sister started screaming at me for calling her daughter ugly. I know it can be a sensitive topic, but she\u2019s a grown adult, and I think she should be able to handle honesty on the subject. She thinks I\u2019m a huge AH, but I\u2019m just trying to be realistic and do what I think is best for my niece.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA x10000 times over.\n\nJust let your sister say what she wants to you about her being beautiful, you don't have to agree.\n\nJust never say what you think out loud if there's a chance she could overhear. \n\nShe's 8, right now appearances hopefully don't matter and I hope she grows up proud and confident of how she looks but words are hurtful. I'm nearly 31 and still living with consequences of people commenting on my appearance when I was a kid. It doesn't need to be said. People know how they look.\n\nYou are however, absolutely correct to compliment her on who she is, which is more important.", "Yeah YTA.\n\nYou don\u2019t call kids ugly, you may think it, but you don\u2019t say that out loud and insult a child.\n\nYou probably weren\u2019t an oil painting as a kid yourself. Probably still aren\u2019t but you don\u2019t say kids are ugly, they lead by example, everyone is beautiful in their own way.", "YTA, this is an 8 year old child! Her parents want her to have some self esteem!  This is one of those times where if you\u2019re thinking it, don\u2019t say it. What kind of aunt are you? Trying to tell the parents not to call their child beautiful. They don\u2019t need your unsolicited advice!!!!", "ESH.\n\nI wish everyone would stop calling little girls pretty. Find literally anything other than their facial features to compliment them on (preferably something that is at least partially under their control).\n\nBut going on about how your niece is so ugly kind of sucks. If you really care for her as a person you wouldn't be so fixated on her appearance. There are more diplomatic ways you could have addressed this with her parents.", "YTA. And frankly, what the fuck? You *don't* call a kid ugly, and if you genuinely think she is, then it's only more of a reason why her parents need to make sure she feels beautiful. What you said was so rude, it's almost unbelievable. And regardless of what you think, that is their child, she is beautiful to them and she deserves to hear that. If nothing else, it shows her that she's loved by them.\n\nWhy can't you praise her other traits, and also tell her that everyone is beautiful in their own way, including her? If you ever tell that little girl she's ugly or make her feel like any kids who bully her for her looks are right, you're going to do far, FAR more damage to her self-esteem. Body image issues are real.", "BIG YTA. shes just a baby omfg. how do u think she will feel growing up hearing people calling her ugly from EIGHT. eight yo kids understand shit. dont be rude keep if to yourself.", "While I agree with the general sentiment that you are the asshole, I find it hilarious how many people didn\u2019t fully read.\n\u201cDon\u2019t call her ugly, don\u2019t judge her by her cover. Praise her other traits, build her self esteem\u201d\n\nLike what you did was tactless and dumb but your point was exactly what these people are talking about \ud83d\ude02", "YTA I don't have anything nice to say so I'll just leave my judgement....ah", "Your mentality is that people who aren't conventionally meeting the beauty standards should be bullied to knock them down a peg. How do you not see you are the bully in this situation.\n\nBelieve it or not, beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and everyone finds different things beautiful-- you aren't the god who decides who gets to be labeled beautiful or ugly. Why are you so shallow? YTA", "hmm, I'm saying ESH. You are MAJORLY in the wrong. You're worried about kids being cruel and bullying her? But here you are straight up calling her ugly to her own parents. Like what is wrong with you? You're turning into the bully you claim to be so concerned about. Don't be her first bully.\n\nAll that being said I think it's weird her parents are insisting other people give her praise directly tied to her appearance. If they want to praise her that's all well and good but they shouldn't be requesting others give her this praise too, that's weird IMO", "YTA. Worst aunt award goes to you.", "YTA and a horrible aunt i wouldn\u2019t want my kids near you.", "ESH I think your approach of commending her positive non-aesthetic traits is good, but not because she specifically is ugly. I think it\u2019s better not to put an emphasis on looks in general.\n\nYou could have just said that to her parents, but no, you called her ugly, making you an asshole. They are assholes for telling you you have to call their daughter beautiful, that\u2019s weird and domineering.", "Typical bully. I bet you beat your wife.", "Oh....you're ugly. And YTA. \n\nI teach my children that beauty is on the inside. Your face can be a pleasing to look at but if you open your mouth and spew hatred or negativity you become quite ugly. And vice versa. Same with being fat....if they are being greedy they will be called fat. They usually smile and say \"I know...I'm so hungry right now\". You are not wrong for focusing on her best traits but you are definitely wrong for calling her ugly. Btw....many of the world's most beautiful people were some goofy behind looking kids. Wait for her glow up.", "and I'm sure you're a niner yourself", "Guess what OP, you\u2019re one of those cruel kids you mentioned. YTA", "yta this could\u2019ve been handled differently", "NTA.  Isn\u2019t reddit always talking about how we should be teaching young girls that their value doesn\u2019t come solely from their appearances?  Then someone does that and reddit dumps all over him.\n\nOP isn\u2019t going around telling his niece she\u2019s ugly, and he emphasizes and praises her for the many good qualities she *does* have.  OP is right: if the parents constantly tell her she\u2019s beautiful if she\u2019s not and place undue worth and emphasis on her appearance, then that could hinder the niece down the line\u2014not just because it places too much value on physical beauty, something reddit, until now, always says is bad, but because if she grows up and realises her parents were lying to her, she could have trust issues and not believe any of their other praise either.\n\n\u201dBeauty is subjective!\u201d Yes, it is, but if she\u2019s subjectively ugly to a lot of people, then it\u2019s still better that she builds her confidence from her skills and personality and other traits rather than her appearance, isn\u2019t it?  Not everyone is going to find you beautiful and if her parents place all the emphasis on beauty, she\u2019s going to find it harder to deal with when not everyone agrees.\n\nWhy is everyone in this comment section acting like OP is some monster who\u2019s going around telling his niece she\u2019s ugly to her face?", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019ve never been comfortable praising children about something as superficial and unearned as looks. You have the right idea about praising their other traits, right now the child doesn\u2019t have esteem issues but if they do develop them, being patronised by their parents might not be the best idea.\n\nAlso it is weird that the parents are asking you to give specific compliments.\n\nEdit: you did not have to call the child ugly to the parents btw, right or wrong, that\u2019s not going to go over well.", "YTA, one of those \"I'm the most brutally honest person you'll ever meet\" people who's way more interested in the brutality than the honesty.", "NTA - I mean yes it\u2019s unfair but some children are just downright unfortunate looking. But somehow the society had created this aura that all kids are beautiful which in reality they aren\u2019t. It\u2019s like everyone knows this but no one wants to say and it and hence they keep going on with everyone is beautiful narrative. \n\nThis was also addressed in Seinfeld", "Yikes\u2026unpopular opinion but NTA. I don\u2019t agree with lying to kids. And the saying \u201call babies/kids are cute/beautiful\u201d is a huge lie. Some kids DO look funny. And it is what it is. Maybe they\u2019re features will change/they\u2019ll grow into their features when they get older. But if they are not pleasant looking\u2026then they aren\u2019t pleasant looking. \n\nAdditionally, nothings wrong with the compliments for inner beauty\u2026such as intelligence and humor. I think more kids DO need to hear that. Cause when kids only hear they\u2019re cute or beautiful, at some point in time they\u2019re going to try to use that to their advantage, and it makes for an ugly personality. I actually had a friend\u2026or really a few\u2026who you could tell all they were told was that they\u2019re beautiful. Definitely had horrible personalities and walked all over people. And we\u2019re demanding. Of course that\u2019s not to say all pretty people act like this.\n\nEdit: Also\u2026really think it\u2019s weird how your sister continued to push the issue for you calling her daughter beautiful. That was extra on her part. Not everyone will think her daughter is beautiful, and it\u2019s weird to expect others to think that. What next? Is she going to demand the teachers call her beautiful too!?!", "NTA - regardless of her actual appearance, little girls need to know early on that their value is not tied up in their looks. They\u2019re smart, curious, resourceful, hardworking, sporty\u2026anything other than pretty, beautiful, skinny, etc. Her parents are doing her a massive disservice by putting value on being pretty. And as far as you telling them she\u2019s ugly, that\u2019s on them. You were happy to keep your opinion to yourself until they pushed the issue.", "The fact that you didn\u2019t say it to the kid and me having worked with kids for years: NTA. You are 100% correct children are, as lovely and wonderful they can be, extremely cruel and amazingly talented in finding the weak spots of anyone they do not like or think is lying.\n\n\u2018Inner beauty\u2019 means nothing to kids, they will judge only what they can see and if she\u2019s ugly or merely just not \u2018beautiful\u2019 and claims the title they will tear her apart for \u2018lying\u2019. \n\nYou are actually building her up better with real compliments on things of value, than her parents with their exaggerations of a virtue she doesn\u2019t actually possess. Of course they can(should) call her beautiful, but casually, naturally. Not forced and exaggerated. \n\nBuild on what you have not what you wished you had.", "YTA. Your a fucking ghoul.

And aesthetically pleasing face with an ugly, entitled attitude is one of the ugliest people on earth. Why shouldn\u2019t she be called beautiful you think everything about her is beautiful, except her looks. The other thing is that 8-9 yrs children are transitioning to early adult. Everything is liable to change", "YTA\n\nbeauty is subjective.  \nI understand your point but beauty can be more than just appearances. you can meet a physically beauty and have a horrible attitude that makes her ugly immediately.  \n\nI do agree that they should praise her more for her character than her apperance though", "ESH - They can't force you to call her beautiful but you don't need to call her ugly either. Just say no comment.", "NTA. I think it was unwise for your sister to push the issue.\n\nI do not think it is normal to call children beautiful or good looking. Especially not so obsessively.", "YTA. Some kids go through awkward periods then bloom as they get older. But the more beautiful and confident they are on the inside, the more attractive they will be on the outside.\n\nWe all know beautiful people who turn ugly once they start talking, and less conventionally attractive people who become more beautiful as you get to know them.\n\nYou may think your niece is \"ugly\" but that should never be said out loud.

No. But should you be allowed around a young child who is developing her self esteem if you aren\u2019t the kind of person that understands that beauty isn\u2019t skin deep? Also no. A person can be a beautiful person without meeting your unhinged ass standards. You aren\u2019t helping her in any way because I can tell you from a mother\u2019s standpoint, no amount of stereotypical beauty will stop a child from being bullied so you telling your sister that you\u2019re just trying to \u201chelp\u201d or \u201cdo what\u2019s best\u201d is just you giving yourself permission to be an absolute ass hat.

And while your niece\u2019s looks are not the thing you should focus on, if you don\u2019t think she is privy to your opinions or attitudes then you\u2019re insane.

That's not healthy. You pushed away friends that complimented you. You pushed away your mom who probably genuinely sees you as beautiful. \n\nSecond: your mom, in her mind, wasn't lying.

You sound like you had a very difficult time growing up. \n\nHowever, kids are mean and even if you were absolutely normal looking (not under-average) or even pretty, they would have found something to bully you about if you were different. I was pretty as a child but I was poor and kids bullied me. I gained weight in high school and I was bullied for being fat. My family didn't tell me I was cute even when I was but were sure to tell me I was fat when I gained weight. I lost a lot of weight again and suddenly everyone was all compliments, but guess what, it didn't matter because I knew that most people didn't really care about me at all, only how I looked or made them feel. \n\nWhat does that have to do with OP and his niece or you, for that matter? Just that everyone's experience is different and whether the kid is ugly or not is not established. Also, do you agree that your family telling you at 8 that you were ugly was the right way to go? Or how about never complimenting you on your appearance at all from 8 onwards? Do either of those seem like normal healthy things to do to a child?\n\nI think there is a danger of going overboard in complimenting kids on their looks, especially if that's all they get complimented on, so in that way I agree that they should be told that they're smart, kind, helpful etc. However, family is supposed to be safe and healing.

I mean if you were convinced to believe bullies over friends and family, to put their opinions, and yes thats what beauty is, an OPINION, over those of people that care about you, I have no idea what you may think of your own kids. \n\nBut letting kids go through childhood thinking they are ugly is so incredible toxic and dangerous to them.

It would have been different if he randomly came up to her and called her ugly", "If you don't have anything nice to say, say something clever but devastating.", "Which is exactly what OP was trying to do\u2026", "And it's as stupid now as it's always been.", "Just because people use it doesn't mean they sound intelligent", "It does. Bullying is literally the act of harming (verbally or physically) another person. \n\nI mean OP has no intention of ever saying it out loud again and only said it to answer the question they were asked.", "I am an educator ha. And yes you\u2019ve got the subconscious (and conscious on OP\u2019s part) aspect, but it\u2019s still not deliberately seeking to cause harm. The end result causing harm to child makes this whole situation not okay, but the use of \u2018bullying\u2019 to describe it isn\u2019t strictly true", "Why are you encouraging lying? It\u2019s literally morally wrong. And the parents, as mature adults they should be able to take truth.", "80% of people in this thread aren't reading", "Then that\u2019s an AH move by the parents, not the uncle. How is this so hard to understand?", "The parents brought it up, maybe if they ask", "How does that contradict OP?", "Or it gives her a barrier of self-esteem to deflect any comments.", "And what if her puzzle took her too long, or her joke wasn\u2019t funny. Are you going to tell an 8 year old she\u2019s stupid as fuck, or has a shit personality.", "That's the whole point I made in the first comment. That he should not find her attractive right now and even though he doesn't think that will change when she's an adult that doesn't matter because someone in the world will find her beautiful _as an adult._ You're just looking to be angry over something because nowhere did I say it was okay or that someone should be attracted to an 8 year old.", "I hated myself just writing it.", "He has a valid point. I don\u2019t think the main praise anyone receives should be looks based. He should have stuck to that explanation rather than just bluntly telling the truth as he sees it.

Beauty, as in beautiful appearance, is very individual. That is something these RateMe subs show all the time. \n\nSo if the parents want that their daughter is treated as beautiful as they percieve her, then people should follow that or at least stay silent. \n\nAnd contrary to OP, I would applaud the parents for their approach. It helps the bond with the daughter and empowers the daughter.", "It's NOT a matter of fact. It's not uncommon for people who aren't traditionally good looking to be be attractive to others due to who they are and how they carry themselves. What he's doing is sharing his OPINION based on his own personal values. Nothing more.", "And it\u2019s still really shitty no matter where he states it", "Honestly probably because it's a girl and lots of women haters on reddit. Gotta put them babies down so they don't get a self esteem. \n\nPeople can be beautiful to you without being physically gorgeous. Honestly I feel terrible for op because he clearly doesn't understand that.", "Still don't be calling an 8 year old ugly that's ridiculous", "they *literally* pried it out of him?  *literally* like with a crow bar? nobody can *make* you say something you know is wrong to say.", "Lol tell me you're an ass without telling me.", "I didn\u2019t say they sound more (or less) intelligent than anyone else. \n\nPersonally I think this is the fun part of language. How it evolves beyond its original usage, like it has a mind of its own. You can correct all you\u2019d like but it\u2019s pointless. You can\u2019t stop it. \n\nThere\u2019s something about the way \u201cirregardless\u201d rolls off the tongue that makes it enjoyable to say, in my opinion. Have a little fun!", "So? Colloquialisms aren\u2019t supposed to make you sound intelligent. Being pedantic about grammar without understanding that language evolves doesn\u2019t make you sound smart or nice", "Just because you don't think they sound intelligent doesn't mean it isn't a valid word", "The truth isn\u2019t always useful or kind.", "Exactly. The parents frequently compliment their daughter's looks which is whatever but then they try to strong arm this guy into joining in.", "Scrolling and reading is hard I guess\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He literally said in the post that he called her ugly to her parents\u2019 faces\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They mean he didn\u2019t call her ugly as in not to her face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And thus contradicting OP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this explains my reply:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He literally said in the post that he called her ugly to her parents\u2019 faces\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's get a closer look\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>said in the post that he called her ugly\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwait a minute...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>They mean he didn\u2019t call her ugly as in not to her face.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps.", "Being confident in her other strengths will give her a barrier of self esteem. She\u2019ll have high self esteem if she believes in herself for other reasons.", "Well, I'm not exaggerating when I say I love you for writing it, so that probably brings all the balance back to the world and humanity as a whole.", "Let us hope his niece never hears that", "OP is literally trying to go with the second option, stay silent and instead compliment her on her other positive traits. The parents are trying to force OP to go with the first option.", ">or at least stay silent.\n\nwell he tried, \n\n>**But they insist that I call her beautiful too**, and I said no and explained why", "Thats still placing views on a pedestal, lying to her will only hurt her in the future, op is complimenting her on her character and actions, something she has control of. And you are delusional if you think parents have the right to control what other people think of their child, and dude literally did what you said, he doesnt think she is beautiful so he stayed silent about thay until the parents started pressuring him to lie to the girl", "Ignoring reality doesnt solve anything, this is only an issue because the parents made it so, if not for that the ugly thing wouldnt have left OPs mouth. No one should be forced call a kid beautiful when there are many more important things op already is complimenting her on", "Y\u2019all are setting her up for failure by wanting her to think it\u2019s more important than it is, while also letting her get completely lied to lmfao. The truth exists, not everyone can be super gorgeous and that\u2019s fine.", "He didn't call her ugly.\n\nI spoke the truth when prodded about it relentlessly by the parents.\n\nThe parents were not content with his praise of her intelligence and her sense of humor, they insist OP call her beautiful.", "Using language unseriously is way funner than policing other people", "It\u2019s not always supposed to be useful or kind. But it\u2019s still right, no matter how useful or kind.", "Oh I see sorry! They\u2019re not contradicting OP though because they\u2019re saying that OP didn\u2019t call her ugly to her face. What OP said in the post was that he called her ugly to her parents. Two different things. \n\nSo in other words, you cannot cut what you\u2019ve quoted down to \u201csaid in the post that he called her ugly\u201d because it completely loses the meaning. It\u2019s all about who he said she was ugly to. In the post he says parents. The commenter was talking about OP not calling her ugly to her own face.", "That's...not how being a teen works. I was super creative and in a lot of AP classes, but that didn't stop me from being very self-conscious about my looks (and I wasn't conventionally unattractive after 14 or so). The vast majority of teens are going to have not great self-esteem, no matter how pretty, smart, artistic, etc. they are. A parent doesn't have to tell their kid they're going to be a rocket scientist or a supermodel, but the family should still say kind things.", "He literally called her ugly. It\u2019s right there in the post.", "There is no harm in a child thinking they\u2019re pretty.\n\nYou don\u2019t always have to be right.", "If OP called her ugly to her face and said so, then it would contradict OP to say that he didn't. It's really that simple.", "OP has described what the harm is and it\u2019s very valid. That when she gets knocked for her lack of beauty she\u2019ll be even more upset than if it hadn\u2019t been said by her parents to her loads. And she won\u2019t appreciate her other good traits if all her parents talk about is beauty. \n\nWhy don\u2019t we always have to be right? In society we\u2019ve deemed that we\u2019re supposed to do what\u2019s right and not do what\u2019s wrong. That\u2019s how we live our lives."]}
