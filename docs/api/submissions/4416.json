I (38F) and my family (13M) 'Tyler' and his sister (17F) 'Kristilyn' (their father is not in the picture anymore) were going to my cousin's house in Tennessee where they are hosting for Thanksgiving. They host it almost every year so we kept this going as a tradition.\n\nWe planned to stop by a hotel in the city to stay over prior and after the party per usual. When we made it into Tennessee via plane, I had all of our luggage but Tyler's. I always keep a distinctive tag on luggage handles so it stands out to prevent it from getting lost and to make it easier to look for when it goes through the machine at pick up. I asked Tyler and kristilyn if they'd seen it at all yet they haven't. We've gone through lost and found yet no one seen it. Eventually we just left and assumed someone took it by accident without any bad intentions. It only had a few things anyways.\n\nHowever, Tyler's luggage had his stuff only except for mine with a few of his essential items such as his phone, toothbrush, and a few other items to keep it safe. This is where it may have been my fault, it didn't go through to me that his clothes were in his luggage at the time so by the time we made it to the hotel, it was too late. I told him that one way or another, he's not going to show up in shorts and a dirty shirt to a party. My cousin have been hosting for years and I don't want to let them down and leave a bad impression so I had him wear his sister's clothes. my cousin and family were expecting us to be here within an hour and showing up with non formal clothes while everyone else is formal is not ideal. He kept fussing but it wasn't even a big deal, it's literally just his sister's shorts, and her flannel shirt over it\n\nI did get questioned about it but when I explained, they seemed to understand. I've been getting bad-eyes from family during the party but what was I even supposed to do.\n\n\nEdit: For everyone saying its not even formal, it's short shorts and a shirt under an open flannel, but I see how I'm the AH, I understand", "created_utc": 1670694655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhyoto/aita_for_making_my_son_wear_his_sisters_clothes/", "score": 733, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
