I (38F) and my family (13M) 'Tyler' and his sister (17F) 'Kristilyn' (their father is not in the picture anymore) were going to my cousin's house in Tennessee where they are hosting for Thanksgiving. They host it almost every year so we kept this going as a tradition.\n\nWe planned to stop by a hotel in the city to stay over prior and after the party per usual. When we made it into Tennessee via plane, I had all of our luggage but Tyler's. I always keep a distinctive tag on luggage handles so it stands out to prevent it from getting lost and to make it easier to look for when it goes through the machine at pick up. I asked Tyler and kristilyn if they'd seen it at all yet they haven't. We've gone through lost and found yet no one seen it. Eventually we just left and assumed someone took it by accident without any bad intentions. It only had a few things anyways.\n\nHowever, Tyler's luggage had his stuff only except for mine with a few of his essential items such as his phone, toothbrush, and a few other items to keep it safe. This is where it may have been my fault, it didn't go through to me that his clothes were in his luggage at the time so by the time we made it to the hotel, it was too late. I told him that one way or another, he's not going to show up in shorts and a dirty shirt to a party. My cousin have been hosting for years and I don't want to let them down and leave a bad impression so I had him wear his sister's clothes. He defied at first but I threatened to take away his phone if he didn't listen because my cousin and family are expecting us to be here within an hour and showing up with non formal clothes while everyone else is formal is not ideal. He kept fussing but it wasn't even a big deal, it's literally just his sister's shorts, and her flannel shirt.\n\nI did get questioned about it but when I explained, they seemed to understand. I've been getting bad-eyes from family during the party but what was I even supposed to do.", "created_utc": 1670694655, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhyoto/aita_for_making_my_son_wear_his_sisters_clothes/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How was wearing his older sister\u2019s shorts and flannel shirt any better than his regular clothes?", "So instead of wearing his shorts, you made him wear his sister's shorts? That doesn't even make sense. You humiliated your son for absolutely no reason.", "Too late\u2026. Already happened.", "Are you actually ok? Don\u2019t you remember being 13?", "How is wearing his sister's clothes better, YTA", "You already were a dick", "Damn. I\u2019ve been packing wrong all these years.", "That was, indeed, my point", "Ooh ok i misread, thanks it makes a lot more sense", "No, she had the option of explaining what happened, instead of forcing him to wear his sister's clothes.", "There were plenty of other solutions:\n1. Stop by a store\n2. Let him wear what he was currently wearing, and explain what happened and that it couldn't be helped\nInstead, you decided to be a dick to your own 13 year-old. \n\nYTA", "Honestly you were lucky and he was unlucky that his sister's clothes had fit him. Stores open late, you could have gotten him new clothes. Going to the party was pointless for him if he felt embarrassed and didn't have fun. You owe him an apology.", "Ha! You found the ONE person on this thread saying what you did was OK, congrats", "theres a walmart or kmart or something in every single city that was open on the holiday. YTA", "Even a comic or game shop has clothes", "This is what I was wondering.  \n\n>It didn't it through me that his clothes were in his luggage.\n\nWHERE ELSE WOULD IT BE!?!", "If you had to explain anyway, why couldn\u2019t you just explain why he was in his plane clothes?? Assuming you didn\u2019t have time to do a quick shop somewhere.", "Hell was there no male family member coming that could\u2019ve brought an extra outfit.", "I had a piece of luggage that was put on the earlier flight, we had a 4 hour layover, and was there waiting for me when I got there.", "But she wasn't aggressive ok...just wow. \n\nYTA.", "tHaTs nOT AGgrEsSiOn, THatS ParEnTiNG!!!", "Lol. YUP - OP that's super nice of you to kindly \"suggest\" you son wear clothes he's really uncomfortable with.", "If that's OP being *passive*, I don't think I wanna know what *aggressive* is like.", "But you also aren\u2019t being featured on *To Catch a Smuggler* \ud83e\udd23", "Even if there weren't or a $15 pair of jeans & a $5 Tshirt was beyond OP's means, they're going to a family member's house. There was no one at all OP could contact and ask about bringing a spare set of clothes. Hell, if the kid was wearing shorts one way or another, why not just swap his \"dirty\" Tshirt for the flannel and let him wear his own shorts. A flannel is going to be a lot more gender neutral than even the frumpiest pair of women's shorts.", "Exactly? Why was she more worried about him getting changed into different clothes than wearing his OWN clothes? When you\u2019re 13 year old boy everything is embarrassing let alone wearing your older sister\u2019s clothes", "She could have literally called and asked someone to bring a spare t shirt and shorts. Like wtf", "OP on this subreddit in 20 years: \u2018AITA for trying to reach out to my son and finally meet my grandchildren - for some reason my son is really distant from me and never calls\u2019", "He could've worn sisters' clothes for a couple hours to wash his clothes at the hotel too. What kind of idiocy is this? Then his clothes would have been clean. Either the hotel would have had a paid service for it, or they could have washed it in the room sink. \n\nOr you know, bought a new set of clothes somewhere in said major city."]}
