For every day they don\u2019t clean up neither do you. If your bf doesn\u2019t want to have to clean the place spotless every 4 days he is going to have to contribute daily. If he doesn\u2019t want his son to clean up after himself then he will have to do his share too. Then you absolutely stick to the rules. No threats, no ultimatum just a very reasonable plan.
