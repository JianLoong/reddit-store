Your boyfriend is enabling bad behaviour. NTA and do not clean up after his son", "NTA, good for you! This is exactly the appropriate way to deal with the situation.

Which honestly still sounds like a win for you.", "NTA\n\nTell them both where to go and how to get there.", "Play the game - acknowledge that he cleaned, praise him if he wants it but make it clear you will not be the only one cleaning up any longer. For every day they don\u2019t clean up neither do you. If your bf doesn\u2019t want to have to clean the place spotless every 4 days he is going to have to contribute daily. If he doesn\u2019t want his son to clean up after himself then he will have to do his share too. Then you absolutely stick to the rules. No threats, no ultimatum just a very reasonable plan. When you\u2019re a family you\u2019re a team. Everyone works together to make everyone\u2019s life easier.
