Feel like downsizing to a smaller place with fewer amenities? Want to start setting the thermostat at somewhat uncomfortable temperatures? Since rent and utilities are the only things you listed that she contributes equally to, those are the only places she can really cut back, and with your not wanting to pay more than 50%, you've got to do something to reduce overall cost.

Not even a soft one. In a partnership it should be proportional. In my marriage there was a period of time where I earned 80% of our total income. I paid 80% of the shared bills. She has qualified and now earns more than me and, before we got married, she paid a greater percentage. When we got married both incomes became household money and we each get our own spending money.

Even though the numbers are made up, my  point should still be valid. \n\nPerson A earns $10,000 a month and spends  $2,000 a month on bills/expenses while single. \n\nPerson B earns $1,000 a month and spent $800 a month on bills while single. (Higher % of income because there is only so low you can get your living expenses.)\n\nPerson A and B move in together at A\u2019s home. They keep their finances separate. \n\nLet\u2019s say that $500 of B\u2019s expenses came from housing, so their new combined expenses are $2000 + ($800-$500).   Or $2300 a month. \n\nIf they split the bills proportionally, let\u2019s say 90%-10%, then person A is now spending $2070 a month and person B is spending $230 a month. \n\nBy moving in with their significant other and splitting the bills proportionally, person A is saving $70 less a month and person B is saving $570 more a month.  \n\n\nIn my opinion, the fairest way to split finances, at least for the first few years, is to adjust the financial burden in a way so that both people save the same amount of money from moving in together. \n\nIn my hypothetical example above, that would mean person A covers $1750/mo and person B covers $550/month. This way, they both save an additional $250/month compared to living separately.\n\nEdit to add:\nOn this post\u2019s situation specifically, OP mentioned that his GF\u2019s expenses are unchanged as compared to before. That would indicate that he is keeping 100% of the savings created from moving in together. He definitely needs to contribute more.

So she got her boyfriend to move in, she doesn't pay more rent/utilities and now doesn't have to pay for food anymore, but she feel she needs to get even more money from her bf because he earns mode? At this point, his finances are none of her business.\n\nPersonally, I i would never want my partner to struggle. So, they should be able to afford a decent lifestyle without worrying about everything.
