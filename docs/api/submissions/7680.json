I feel really bad and I feel like I should apologise. My husband said I didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I sent a screenshot of the text to one of my friends who attended the dinner and she also said I have nothing to apologise for.

She said your could bring food that met your restrictions. You can\u2019t control if people liked your food better. \n\nTo be honest she could have made sure you could eat the main dish and none of this would have happened. I don\u2019t purposely make food that alienates some of my guests when I cook for people.", "NTA, your host is a clear asshole. Who invites a Muslim couple over and serve pork as the main dish.", "NTA, but also rude of her to invite Muslims to dinner and plan to feed them pork.", "NTA you asked ahead of time. It's not your fault that no one ate her food. So you shouldn't be blamed. \n\nThe guests should have eaten at least some of her food. But when hosting a party you assume not everyone will eat or like what you cook. That's why most people have a variety of dishes. The host is just taking out her frustrations on you!\n\nIt does not matter that the food was halal. It could have been a food allergy or even a health reason. Most people would have brought enough to share. It would be rude not too.", "NTA - You asked before bringing the food.", "I agree with your husband and friend. You're NTA here. You asked permission to bring food and the hostess said yes, so you did. She shouldn't be blaming you that her dish was less enticing.", "NTA, she wanted you over for dinner but put pork in it?  Did she bother to ask about any diet restrictions medical or religious at all? That's like someone feeding me steak with wild rice and broccoli. I'd be drinking water and dreaming of eating when I got home because of my diet restrictions. I also do not eat pigs, nor cows, goats, sheep, well any mammal. You were probably played for her kicks and maybe invite her back for the most exotic dish you can think of from your heritage. Something punishingly spicey, perhaps.", "NTA. She said you could bring a dish. Honestly, all the food sounds good so I would have tried it all lol. The friends at the party could have been a bit more polite and made sure to take a little bit of everything. Lasagna is pretty basic, so I'm not sure why people avoided that dish.", "NTA. You asked, she accepted. Now she's hurt that your dish was better liked than hers. Sucks to be her.", "NTA. And as she had invited you, she should have made sure that you had something to eat. She didn't, you asked and people liked your food better. And just like you, I would have brought more food. Otherwise would have been just rude .", "NTA. She was, however, the asshole for inviting you and your husband while not providing food for you guys. Usually, people ALWAYS provide vegetarian options for guests who don't want to consum meat / non halal meat. Your friend was ok with half arse-ing the hosting part and then got jealous because her food wasn't as popular as yours.", "NTA - You asked if you could bring a separate dish, she said yes.  It appears the only thing you are guilty of is being a good cook.", "NTA  \n\n\nyou asked, and recieved permission, otherwise you would have had to skip, or go hungry.", "NTA.\n\nYou said you asked her beforehand if you could bring food and she approved.  Guessing she thought that it would be only for you and your husband.  It wasn't clarified.  You cannot be held responsible for the other's eating habits.  Just politely remind her that you asked and she said yes.  Now you'll know for next time that she has selective memory.", "NTA. You asked ahead of time and she said it was ok. It's not your fault your dish was amazing. Heck, I would be inviting you over weekly. I love curry chicken and roti. I used to live in the Bay Area, and boy do I miss all the delicious Indian food.", "You were not disrespectful, on the contrary, you did not ask her to accommodate you  ( which we see way to often in food eat / no eat situations ). \n\nThe issue is not halal or not, the issue is that your food was a hit and hers was not. She must have felt embarrassed and hurt as a host, but it is no one's fault, just bad luck.\n\nso NTA", "NTA- you asked permission and got it.", "NTA. She shouldn't have agreed if she thought it was disrespectful. Being that she did agree beforehand, that makes you absolutely not disrespectful and NTA. \n\nP.S. your food sounds delicious!", "NTA\nYou were gracious in accepting the invitation after learning that she'd planned a menu including pork for a dinner to which she'd invited practicing Muslims. You asked for & recieved permission to contribute to her table dishes you &  your husband can eat . \n\nThe other guests would have been more polite to take at least a little of the lasagna but it's hardly your fault that they did not.", "NTA, you did everything right before the dinner, your friend is jealous.", "NTA I understand why your friend might be annoyed but you definitely didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA but who makes a main dish with pork when they've invited Muslim friends to dinner?   You asked and she agreed.  You didn't nothing wrong.", "It\u2019s not your fault that people didn\u2019t like her dish lmao. You were responsible and respectful and brought the food that you could eat \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe NTA", "NTA and its strange they invited you but didn't buy halal or male vegetarian option. I had a party for my kids friend a few years ago and there was one Muslim kid so everyone had halal haribo.

She was just hurt the gusts preferred your food.", "NTA\n\nYou asked if you could bring a dish. She said you could bring a dish. You brought a dish. She\u2019s mad that you brought a dish.\n\nPerhaps she thought you meant just a dish for yourself and your husband, and not one to share with everyone. Even then, an essay-length text message telling you off for being disrespectful earns her AH points, and serving a dish with pork in it that at least two of her guests can\u2019t eat earns her even more.\n\nI\u2019d just call and ask why she said it was okay to bring a dish if it wasn\u2019t okay to bring a dish and let the conversation happen from there.", "NTA.

It was her party and, in this case, she can cry if she wants to. \n\nThe host may be slightly TA for not offering to make you something, but you didn't really give her the option, so actually possibly a double YTA from you.

The last gathering I hosted I made five quarts of soup for eight people as the announced plan was \"I handle the main and some snacks, other sides and drinks are potluck.\".
