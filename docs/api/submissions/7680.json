It's not your fault that no one ate her food. So you shouldn't be blamed. \n\nThe guests should have eaten at least some of her food. But when hosting a party you assume not everyone will eat or like what you cook. That's why most people have a variety of dishes.

Most people would have brought enough to share. It would be rude not too.", "NTA - You asked before bringing the food.", "I agree with your husband and friend. You're NTA here.

Did she bother to ask about any diet restrictions medical or religious at all? That's like someone feeding me steak with wild rice and broccoli. I'd be drinking water and dreaming of eating when I got home because of my diet restrictions. I also do not eat pigs, nor cows, goats, sheep, well any mammal. You were probably played for her kicks and maybe invite her back for the most exotic dish you can think of from your heritage. Something punishingly spicey, perhaps.", "NTA. She said you could bring a dish. Honestly, all the food sounds good so I would have tried it all lol.

I'm Jewish, but completely secular and non-observant.

Always this. If you are hosting, the food should always be made to accomodate your guests. Wether that is serving completely different meals or not.

Most of them are not.", "The guest didn't really give her a chance to do otherwise, as she states she didn't want to put the host out by asking her to cook an alternative. As I said, it comes from a place of kindness from the guest, but you don't upstage the host. It's a dinner party and a chance for them to do something for the guests. By offering to cook straight away, its like saying you don't trust the host to make an alternative, or that their cooking is good enough. \n\nAsshole is not be the right word for it (there are no intermediate options here) - but maybe un-tactful would be more accurate.", "That's fair re. the host, but this isn't \"is someone else TA\" - you don't upstage the host, especially at a dinner party.
