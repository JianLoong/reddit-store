Most people would have brought enough to share. It would be rude not too.", "NTA - You asked before bringing the food.", "I agree with your husband and friend. You're NTA here.

Did she bother to ask about any diet restrictions medical or religious at all? That's like someone feeding me steak with wild rice and broccoli. I'd be drinking water and dreaming of eating when I got home because of my diet restrictions. I also do not eat pigs, nor cows, goats, sheep, well any mammal.

As I said, it comes from a place of kindness from the guest, but you don't upstage the host. It's a dinner party and a chance for them to do something for the guests.

Whenever I have guests over for dinner I always ask about allergies or dietary restrictions. That just seems like common courtesy.\n\nThere are however, practical limits. Suppose your guest is an Orthodox Jew. Even if you were to serve them food you *think* is kosher, it wouldn't be. For one, your dishes aren't kosher. So you might think, \"I'll just use paper plates and plasticware.\" And that'd be a great thought, but you'd be preparing it in a non-kosher kitchen, rendering the food non-kosher. You technically can kasher (making something kosher which isn't) certain kitchen appliances, but it takes a considerable amount of work and time (24+ hours of non-use after appropriate deep cleaning), which isn't practical generally, and isn't possible on short notice. Even then, there are all sorts of odd quirks, like the fact that you can kasher a microwave, but not the glass plate used in it. And so in that circumstance, if you're going to feed them in your home, you're basically limited to fruit that can be eaten raw and uncut, or pre-packaged kosher food, served on paper plates. Even then, you theoretically have to make sure that the hechsher (kosher certification) is from a certifying authority they recognize as valid (which is more of an issue than you might expect). And even then, you probably want to make sure it is parve (no dairy or meat) because many Orthodox Jews take the prohibition on not mixing milk and meat to mean waiting at least six hours between eating one and eating the other. Obviously, even within the Orthodox world, the strictness is variable. So I mention this in part because it is interesting to me as an ex-Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jew who had to decline most kind offers of food from others in my youth, and because I think it is important to point out that \"common courtesy\" as relates to dinner parties is necessarily bounded by practicality in some cases.\n\nObvious the OP's situation is less dire - Islamic dietary law is far more forgiving than the laws of kashrut. But, for example, even approved animals need to be certified halal to be in compliance with sharia dietary rules. So just excluding pork presumably wouldn't have sufficed. The host would need to secure halal meat, which may be more easily said than done depending upon where they live. Even if we assume that the OP did exactly that, and therefore that it is available locally, it may be the sort of thing that requires going to specialty stores the host didn't even know about.\n\nSo, while I think the OP has nothing to apologize for, I'm receptive to the idea that the host's capacity to provide a compliant meal may have been limited.", "If vegetarian or vegan friends invite me to dinner I know that I am going to have the best vegetarian or vegan meal I can possibly have!!!", "And who only brings enough for themselves? Everyone would have been looking at them thinking how odd. That said the hostess would have been pleased as punch I suppose!", "Even if it was great, it's still less novel (to most people) than a good curry and roti, so they may have been more excited to try that over a food they're well familiar with. \n\nOr maybe the friends think it's a dick move to make a pork lasagne for halal friends, so it's solidarity. Or maybe OPs friend is a known average cook.
