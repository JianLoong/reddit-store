Most people would have brought enough to share. It would be rude not too.", "NTA - You asked before bringing the food.", "I agree with your husband and friend. You're NTA here.

Did she bother to ask about any diet restrictions medical or religious at all? That's like someone feeding me steak with wild rice and broccoli. I'd be drinking water and dreaming of eating when I got home because of my diet restrictions. I also do not eat pigs, nor cows, goats, sheep, well any mammal.

As I said, it comes from a place of kindness from the guest, but you don't upstage the host. It's a dinner party and a chance for them to do something for the guests.

Whenever I have guests over for dinner I always ask about allergies or dietary restrictions. That just seems like common courtesy.\n\nThere are however, practical limits. Suppose your guest is an Orthodox Jew. Even if you were to serve them food you *think* is kosher, it wouldn't be. For one, your dishes aren't kosher. So you might think, \"I'll just use paper plates and plasticware.\" And that'd be a great thought, but you'd be preparing it in a non-kosher kitchen, rendering the food non-kosher. You technically can kasher (making something kosher which isn't) certain kitchen appliances, but it takes a considerable amount of work and time (24+ hours of non-use after appropriate deep cleaning), which isn't practical generally, and isn't possible on short notice. Even then, there are all sorts of odd quirks, like the fact that you can kasher a microwave, but not the glass plate used in it. And so in that circumstance, if you're going to feed them in your home, you're basically limited to fruit that can be eaten raw and uncut, or pre-packaged kosher food, served on paper plates. Even then, you theoretically have to make sure that the hechsher (kosher certification) is from a certifying authority they recognize as valid (which is more of an issue than you might expect). And even then, you probably want to make sure it is parve (no dairy or meat) because many Orthodox Jews take the prohibition on not mixing milk and meat to mean waiting at least six hours between eating one and eating the other. Obviously, even within the Orthodox world, the strictness is variable. So I mention this in part because it is interesting to me as an ex-Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jew who had to decline most kind offers of food from others in my youth, and because I think it is important to point out that \"common courtesy\" as relates to dinner parties is necessarily bounded by practicality in some cases.\n\nObvious the OP's situation is less dire - Islamic dietary law is far more forgiving than the laws of kashrut. But, for example, even approved animals need to be certified halal to be in compliance with sharia dietary rules. So just excluding pork presumably wouldn't have sufficed. The host would need to secure halal meat, which may be more easily said than done depending upon where they live. Even if we assume that the OP did exactly that, and therefore that it is available locally, it may be the sort of thing that requires going to specialty stores the host didn't even know about.\n\nSo, while I think the OP has nothing to apologize for, I'm receptive to the idea that the host's capacity to provide a compliant meal may have been limited.", "If vegetarian or vegan friends invite me to dinner I know that I am going to have the best vegetarian or vegan meal I can possibly have!!!", "And who only brings enough for themselves? Everyone would have been looking at them thinking how odd. That said the hostess would have been pleased as punch I suppose!", "Even if it was great, it's still less novel (to most people) than a good curry and roti, so they may have been more excited to try that over a food they're well familiar with. \n\nOr maybe the friends think it's a dick move to make a pork lasagne for halal friends, so it's solidarity.

Whenever I host dinner parties I try my best to make meals that all of the guests can enjoy whether they have allergies, dietary needs, or religious restrictions. I even tracked down kosher marshmallows (that tasted good) and cake mix to make Star Wars cupcakes for my neighbor and his kids. I do let the guests know they are welcome to bring their own food and they usually prepare items that won\u2019t trigger other guests allergens (though if they do I place allergen food in a separate area with different dishes/utensils to\ntry to prevent cross contamination and let everyone know about it)", "NTA  \nYou asked they said yes. They invited you + your partner and offered no halal options, despite knowing you two are Muslim. You're food was better and that's nothing to feel bad about.

It wouldn't be rude. \n\nHere it is not a health issue and likely OP won't be forced often to bring food for themselves, but the principle is the same.

Well, they serve vegetable soup with meat balls and then complain I don't stay at the party for dinner lol.\n\nAnyway, you don't exactly have to cater to someone.

I learned a lot about vegetarian cooking and whatever I made her I would make for our own dinner as well. I have to say I became very good at it!

Sounds like she wanted people to hate your food, and is bitter and mad that they actually liked it more than hers.

How strictly people adhere to that interpretation and view varies widely though.
