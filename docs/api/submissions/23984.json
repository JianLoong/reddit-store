If it were my teen and their friend did that they would be in such big trouble.", "Yeah fuck em!", "Sounds like they learned it from their parents.", ">On the odd occasion that it truly wasn't their fault, we would roleplay how they could have handled the situation differently. \n\ncan you give an example?", "My kids are at the stage where they try so hard to get the other in trouble. So now I ask what they think the punishment should be, then we walk through what happened, and then the one trying to get the sibling in trouble gets the punishment they dictated at the start. (examole: \"she hit me! I didn't like it!\" \"ok... What do you think her punishment should be?\" \"no switch for two hours!\" \"sounds good. Hey sister, whud you hit brother?\" \"because he hit me twice and broke the Legos I was working in\" \"ahh.. Brother, did you?\" \"... Yes...\" \"ok. Hand me your switch\" \"why?\" \"you said the punishment was no switch for 2 hours\"", "The best we can do as parents is to model the behavior we want to see in our kids.  Teach them empathy, even when it's easier not to.  The kids at the park didn't get that lesson and the parents spoke up out of embarrassment.", "Or you could just like...Eat healthier and exercise, instead of hoping for a magic pill. Ozempic isn't going to make the lifestyle changes for you that will need to be made to not end up obese again, just saying.\n\nEdit just to say: If your BMI is 29.5 and you think Ozempic will fix it, that paints a pretty clear picture of your lifestyle, idk.\n\nIf you ate a single salad a day and also worked out for 2hrs, I'd tell you that's unhealthy and unsustainable. It's not all or nothing, starving or binging, working out to exhaustion or being completely sedentary, you know. \n\nGood luck on your health journey.", "Yep, that's what I try to do.", "or you could just like... mind your own business and stop giving your opinion on my body unsolicited. You don't know my diet, you don't know my exercise regimen. I could literally eat nothing but a single salad a day and work out 2 hours a day and it would still not be enough for you.", "Info:\n\nDid you also older uglier teenagers to go fuck them selfs ?", "The fact that you had to go from telling random teens to fuck off, to telling random redditors to fuck off, is so ironic I\u2019m sorry. NTA and the reason those teens act that way is because mommy and daddy don\u2019t know how to raise kids and have taught them that if they ever do something wrong that it\u2019s not their fault or whatever.", "Any time you tell someone to fuck off it is going to escalate the situation, she was overly aggressive in her response, escalating the situation even farther.\n\nTelling two teens to fuck off, is not a way to ever keep a situation peaceful it is a declaration of your desire to take the situation to another level."]}
