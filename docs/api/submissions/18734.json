{"id": 18734, "submission_id": "13xprz7", "title": "AITA for making my niece choose between her dad or a senior trip?", "selftext": "Long story short, my younger sister \"Christy\" was with a horrible guy (\"John\") throughout college, and ended up getting pregnant with my niece \"Sarah\". John was honestly the mascot for a deadbeat dad. He wasn't there for any of the pregnancy and Christy couldn't get any child support from him. She even offered to give up asking for child support if John would just come and see Sarah, but he refused. I think he only ever saw his daughter a handful of times.\n\nThe most unforgivable thing IMO was when Christy got ill, and ended up passing soon thereafter. John never came to see Christy once in the hospital or went to the funeral, and after she passed, he asked my parents to take care of Sarah, and only then did he start paying a small amount of money. \n\nAlthough I wasn't Sarah's legal guardian, I did a lot to take care of her and saw her as my own daughter. One thing I had promised her was to pay for a senior trip. Everything was on track until I found out that Sarah wanted to go and visit her dad with the money I saved for her senior trip.\n\nI can admit that I'm biased, but I was horrified. I told Sarah that I although I disagree with her seeing John, I wouldn't stop her from meeting up with him. That being said though, I would not fund or facilitate that meeting, and if she wanted to see him so badly, she'd have to do it on her own or John can pay for her ticket if he cared so much. \n\nMy intention for the senior trip fund was for her to do something fun with her girlfriends and to enjoy being young. Not to bridge a meeting between her and a man that's caused a lot of devastation for my family.\n\nSarah's really upset though, and said that it wasn't fair for my gift to come with strings attached. I told her this was bigger than that. Plus, like I said I'm not saying she's not allowed to meet her dad. I'm just saying that I agreed to pay for a trip to Cancun, not for a meet and greet with the man. Plus, if he wanted to see her so badly, he could cough up the dough himself, but he's refusing to pay a cent. \n\nI can tell Sarah's bent up about it, but I think it's the best. But I can tell this is affecting our relationship, so I'd like another opinion.", "created_utc": 1685645195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xprz7/aita_for_making_my_niece_choose_between_her_dad/", "score": 1496, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or perhaps you can encourage her to ask him to help fund the trip - either he'll show he's sincere or she might realize he's not before actually going. \n\nI understand (and even agree) that this man will not be good for her, but part of becoming an adult may be that she needs to experience that herself, and you may need to let her, scary as that is.\n\nNAH", "NAH imo.

By letting her go and use this as her senior trip, you are showing that you will support her and be there when things balls up(no doubt) but by breaking your promise, even if it\u2019s for the greater good, all she will know is that you lied and your relationship may never recover. \nYou could compromise on you paying her ticket home and accommodation if she needs on the proviso that he pay her ticket there. Give him a chance to show true colours before she even gets on the plane. \nEdit- I say this based on going through a very similar situation at her exact age. The whole thing blew up in my face and I learned an awful lesson about the people who bring you into the world. It took years for my relationships to recover because of how awfully they felt betrayed by my attempt at being around a parent that was garbage. That wasn\u2019t fair on me as a very young woman and I would hate for your loving family to go through that.", "YTA \n\nSo you\u2019re telling your niece who already lost one parent they can\u2019t see their other living parent, on a trip you promised to pay for? \n\nRegardless of how you feel about this guy, he\u2019s still her father and she wants to see him, on a trip you promised to pay for. In her eyes, you\u2019re denying her from seeing the only parent she has left.", "That money was ring-fenced for a specific purpose; the senior trip. Your gift to your niece was the trip, not the money. If she wants to visit her dad instead of or as well as going on the trip then she\u2019ll have to find another way to fund that. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re threatening to not pay for the senior trip if she goes to see her dad, so if she can find a way to do both you\u2019d still pay for the trip, would that be correct? If so then definitely NTA.", "NTA. \n\nShe can either pressure him for the money or get a part-time/summer job and save if she wants to see him so badly.\n\nI would still offer the senior trip if you could do so in a way that you'd feel comfortable with. Maybe let her choose the destination and book it yourself?", "NTA. It\u2019s not a cash gift, it\u2019s an offer to pay for a specific activity.  She needs to learn the difference.", "Frankly, I think you handled this poorly. She\u2019s nearly a grown adult now, presumably, and even if you consider her your daughter, she isn\u2019t. You\u2019re trying to parent her in a way that seems to be biting you in the ass.\n\nI totally get not wanting to spend your money facilitating this meeting. I wouldn\u2019t want to either. But that\u2019s her *dad* ffs, the only living parent she has (even if never bothered to parent and he sucks majorly which he obviously does). Do you really want to be the person \u201cmaking her pick\u201d between him and anything else? Do you really think that benefits your relationship with her, especially as she matures into adulthood?\n\nHave a conversation. A real one. Listen to her side. Acknowledge her feelings. Tell her how you wanted the trip, and you gifting it, to make her feel and the kind of things you thought it would allow her to experience. Don\u2019t put your foot down again, so to speak, like you would with a little kid- actually *explain* why you don\u2019t want to spend your money this way. Maybe there\u2019s even another option that you guys can come up with together (ex. asshole visits her for a few days so she has family support in case things don\u2019t go super well, and she takes the fun trip she\u2019s earned by graduating HS, etc.). \n\nSounds like she\u2019s had a ton of big stuff happen to her in her life that was out of her control. Work with her and *think of her first*. Hopefully you guys can come up with a solution that strengthens your relationship and makes you both feel respected.\n\nETA: NAH", ">One thing I had promised her was to pay for a senior trip\n\nYou where clear about what the money you were gifting her was for.\n\n>Sarah's really upset though, and said that it wasn't fair for my gift to come with strings attached.\n\nWhat is not fair is for her to feel entiteled to your money. You said you would pay for a senior trip. Its okay if you don't want to give her money for another kind of trip. \n\n>I can tell Sarah's bent up about it, but I think it's the best.\n\nI understand this is a difficult situation, that is her dad and her mum isnt here anymore... But i still think you have the right to decide what you want your gift to be. NTA", "NTA - if her dad wants to see her like she wants to see him surely he can pay for her to visit. Sure she will quickly see what kind of person her dad is then.", "She\u2019s old enough to be explained why this is the case. I hope you\u2019ve been honest with her about why you won\u2019t be funding this. Also explain that if he wants to get to know her, it should be his responsibility to arrange and facilitate that happening. He has not been a good man and you won\u2019t stop her, but you agreed on a grad trip and this is not a grad trip. It\u2019s a trip to get closer to her father who has only left you and your family with trauma", "NTA She obviously told him about the money. He will be the recipient of your cash.  If she really wants to meet him, she can earn and save just like you did.", "NTA. I pray she goes to Cancun as it\u2019s a once in a lifetime opportunity at her age, and that\u2019s what her mom would have wanted too. The trip to her dads could only be a sad occasion, given he hasn\u2019t made the effort, and maybe would make her feel bad once out there.", "NTA - my uncle was like that man.  When he turned 60 he tracked down his daughter 'to build a relationship'.  His goal was to have somebody mind him in his old age.  Her whole life , nothing and then when he had money , he said he wouldn't leave her anything.   I said if he spent all that money , when he was elderly, I wouldn't lift a finger to help him.  Now he is in his 80s and his money is gambled away, he has nobody who cares for him except perhaps a social worker or AA people\n\nAnother daughter showed up when he was in his 70s and he didn't bother with that poor woman.  She was desperately looking for a connection and he had no emotion.  He was clearly ashamed of however she was conceived.\n\nThe family are sure he has many bio children in several countries and have encouraged the 2 daughters we know to leave it alone.  Nothing good can come from looking for these people.\n\nMen like this suck anything they can from people looking for a connection.", "Her reasoning is more than likely pretty simple.   Her mom has already passed and her \"dad\" is the only \"parent\" left and she wants to know him.  She doesn't \"know\" how he really is, just what has been told to her.  Once she sees how he really is, she'll lose interest but as someone \"without\" \"parents\" she feels like something is missing in her life.\n\nShe more than likely wouldn't be pressing as hard to see him if her bio-mom was still alive.", "The OP is responsible because she loves her niece. The father is not responsible because he doesn't. \n\nHer niece has basically never spent time with her father. She doesn't \"know\" he's an asshole and she won't know until she sees him. She has to come to terms with her father and where she comes from. She's not going to know who she really is until she knows where she came from. The aunt is trying to protect her, but protecting her isn't what she needs. She needs find out for herself what kind of person her father is. Getting in the way of that will just cause strife between them and make her father look like the victim instead of the villain.", "I think it's more like asking for a car and then getting the money and buying a jewelry instead.  You asked for the car because you \"needed\" it then bought something you didn't \"need\".\n\nLike I'll pay for a car but jewelry.", "I remember that post, that father did my head in", "Disagree. Not everything must be spelled out in black and white, and even with legal contracts there's room to imply terms if they are commonsensical to a reasonable businessperson.\n\nSarah definitely knows that OP isn't even obligated to look after her (being a legal guardian for instance) but did so anyway, spending nearly two decades of time and effort to bring her up, with little to no help from her bio dad.\n\nSarah is also likely to be aware of how her bio dad treated her mom / OP's sister and in so doing also hurt OP.\n\nUnless OP explicitly expresses otherwise, it's obvious that OP wouldn't want to fund a trip for Sarah to visit this man who has done OP's family wrong.", "It's a power play on the sperm donor.  He gets her to fly out, then he has a friendly face pick her up, not himself.  His girlfriend most likely.  Then he ends up being too busy to do anything while she's there and when it's time to go, oops, her ticket and ID have disappeared and him and his GF are too busy to drive her.\n\nSo, she's stuck there and now she has to stay with him because she's there with no way to get back and I wouldn't put it past him to take her phone too. I mean if her phone accidently breaks.   Then he convinces her to get a job and \"help\" pay the bills for him since he can't afford it.  Leaving her with no where near enough money to save up to get her back home.\n\nEDIT: I may have seen too many police drama shows.", "That didn't stop my dead beat sperm donor.  He was confined to the state and ended up getting caught on the other side the country with a Semi full of drugs.  He never paid more than $44 a month for 2 kids.  Total, not per kid.", "Don't mean he can't cough up the cash to pay for her to visit him though. That's the point. Ntm he only started giving a little bit of money after the mom passed away. Not the kinda parent any kid should have in their life. I mean shite, that ain't even a parent to begin with. That's simply a sperm donor.", "I said either way I agreed that with OP not funding the trip. Others, however don\u2019t see things the same way and adding her comment to the post strengthens her case about being voted NTA. \n\nI totally disagree with you about legal contracts. There is zero room to imply terms if you want to have the backing of the law to enforce them in the future. I would never sign an employment contract with \u201cimplied terms\u201d for example, common sense or not. An assumption that because it\u2019s common sense, it will prevail is naive. You want everything agreed upon written up fully and signed by both parties.\n\nNot sure what business contracts have to do with my comment though.", "Poor girl is going to get her heart broken.", "This kind of $#!T is why OP needs to tell niece the truth about dad. The bare facts with no emotions added, e.g. \"He wasn't there at all through the pregnancy or birth. He has only given small$ support irregularly, and has made no efforts to see you when he lived nearby. Why do you think he's changed?\" Let her FaceTime with him all she wants and she should see the truth soon enough. Push her to make a thorough plan for how to get there and more important, what to do if she has problems getting back."]}
