{"id": 18734, "submission_id": "13xprz7", "title": "AITA for making my niece choose between her dad or a senior trip?", "selftext": "Long story short, my younger sister \"Christy\" was with a horrible guy (\"John\") throughout college, and ended up getting pregnant with my niece \"Sarah\". John was honestly the mascot for a deadbeat dad. He wasn't there for any of the pregnancy and Christy couldn't get any child support from him. She even offered to give up asking for child support if John would just come and see Sarah, but he refused. I think he only ever saw his daughter a handful of times.\n\nThe most unforgivable thing IMO was when Christy got ill, and ended up passing soon thereafter. John never came to see Christy once in the hospital or went to the funeral, and after she passed, he asked my parents to take care of Sarah, and only then did he start paying a small amount of money. \n\nAlthough I wasn't Sarah's legal guardian, I did a lot to take care of her and saw her as my own daughter. One thing I had promised her was to pay for a senior trip. Everything was on track until I found out that Sarah wanted to go and visit her dad with the money I saved for her senior trip.\n\nI can admit that I'm biased, but I was horrified. I told Sarah that I although I disagree with her seeing John, I wouldn't stop her from meeting up with him. That being said though, I would not fund or facilitate that meeting, and if she wanted to see him so badly, she'd have to do it on her own or John can pay for her ticket if he cared so much. \n\nMy intention for the senior trip fund was for her to do something fun with her girlfriends and to enjoy being young. Not to bridge a meeting between her and a man that's caused a lot of devastation for my family.\n\nSarah's really upset though, and said that it wasn't fair for my gift to come with strings attached. I told her this was bigger than that. Plus, like I said I'm not saying she's not allowed to meet her dad. I'm just saying that I agreed to pay for a trip to Cancun, not for a meet and greet with the man. Plus, if he wanted to see her so badly, he could cough up the dough himself, but he's refusing to pay a cent. \n\nI can tell Sarah's bent up about it, but I think it's the best. But I can tell this is affecting our relationship, so I'd like another opinion.", "created_utc": 1685645195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xprz7/aita_for_making_my_niece_choose_between_her_dad/", "score": 714, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or perhaps you can encourage her to ask him to help fund the trip - either he'll show he's sincere or she might realize he's not before actually going. \n\nI understand (and even agree) that this man will not be good for her, but part of becoming an adult may be that she needs to experience that herself, and you may need to let her, scary as that is.\n\nNAH", "NAH imo.

It\u2019s much safer for her if she has a loving, supportive, and responsible family member in her corner. Show her that she can rely on you no matter what. I just hate the idea of this poor girl traveling alone to meet this shitty dude and possibly feeling trapped in the situation because she thinks everyone back home will say \u201cI told you so\u201d.", "Tell her she can visit dad if he pays for half of the trip.", "Here come the downvotes but\u2026\n\nSarah is a little girl who was abandoned by her father and wants to build a connection with him/figure out why. Sarah has already lost her mother. Her dad is an AH, and she is probably going to find that out, but she is going to need your support when she does. But of course she has to try. She will need to know she did everything she could to have that relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t think you have to fund this, but you do have to stop letting your own hatred for this man come between you and Sarah or Sarah and her father. You would be out no more money letting her decide to visit her father than sending her to Cancun. \n\nSarah is not an AH in this situation. Nah/YTA.\n\nEdit: stupid autocorrect", "NTA the gift has a specific purpose, she isn\u2019t entitled to free money. It\u2019s like an engagement ring, it\u2019s given with the purpose of marriage. Have you explained how he hurt your family ? Maybe she needs a reminder of why you will not pay for her to see him.", "NTA", "It\u2019s your money. She is allowed to be upset but you don\u2019t have to fund a trip to see her deadbeat dad. NTA", "NTA. Let \u2018Dad\u2019 pay for it if he wants to see her so badly.", "NTA.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing.  She needs to explore that relationship herself.  Sometimes the kids have to touch the stove to learn it is hot, even if you tell them over and over.  She needs to work through her own trauma from not having her dad around, and part of that may be going to see him.\n\nWhich trip do you think would be more impactful to her life?  A party in Cancun, or going to try and see if who her dad really is, and process some of the hurt inside about his role in her life?", "NTA and continue to support her and show her that you trust her.  Trust that you've done your job as a parent by allowing her to make her own choice by funding the trip.  If her dad is truly the person you believe him to be, let her discover that for herself.  I hope for her sake that he's changed.", "NTA - you promised money for a senior trip not a trip to see her sperm donor (cos that basically what he is).  If her dad wants to see her that badly  he can pay.", "NTA", "NTA gifts can come with \"strings attached\" in a case like this. You wanted to give her money for something specific. If my dad gave me money for a car I wouldn't go out and get a tattoo with it.", "NTA\n\nTravel for travel sake\u2019s is a rite of passage. That was the gift.", "NTA. \n\nHas Sarah ever met her bio dad? How do they keep in contact? If it\u2019s minimal, and she wants to get to know him, you should suggest she do weekly video calls or something. \n\nYou can add that it\u2019s not Sarah you don\u2019t trust; it\u2019s her bio dad.", "Hopefully his refusal to even try to meet her halfway will be enough to demonstrate exactly WHY she shouldn't be wasting effort or money on trying to build that relationship.", "Come on man, I got a fuckin clock radio when I graduated. And I was grateful (at that time, because I had been groomed to be thankful for any small positive attention - thank you parental authority figures).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Unsure if I should add the /s", "Another $10 says that he\u2019s been collecting her social security orphaned child payments all these years and never gave them to her.", "Except she did specifically say where it was for and the itinerary that would be loosely followed.\n\n\u201cthe promise was specifically for Cancun. She and her friends planned it, and she made me a spreadsheet with the estimated costs and created an itinerary. That was part of the reason why I agreed: I felt like it was a mature way to ask for the funds and I also felt safer knowing where they going and what they planned to do there\u201d", "So her dad can pay for the trip to him then. The man sounds useless and narcissistic. Gonna destroy his daughter.", "She's not stopping her. Just won't pay for it", "Why does she have to fund it? Oh that's right her dad doesn't actually care to see her and won't pay a cent to see her. Sarah can meet her dad on her own dime.", "I would think visiting dad would cost a lot less than cancun.", "You got a clock radio? You lucky, spoiled sot!", "Then the gift is not the money itself, the gift is the trip to Cancun. You didn\u2019t change anything, she is the one who tried to changed the deal.", "I like that. Gonna use it in future.", "Sarah's choice to lose it all for a deadbeat dad."]}
