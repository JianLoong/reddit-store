Me (F27) and my fianc\u00e9 (M28) are getting married in a few months. I've told my fianc\u00e9 from the start that I didn't want any kids at our wedding, and he agreed. We don't have any kids in our families, so that made it easy. We even put on our invitations that it was an adults only event. Our venue also only allows 5 children maximum, because children tend to break things accidentally. \n\nWell over a year into planning our wedding, my sister tells us she's having a baby 2 months before our wedding, and she jokingly asked if her baby was allowed. We said we would think about it, but ideally not. She's also standing in the wedding.\n\nLast week she called and said she needed an answer now, even though her baby isn't due for a couple months.. and we said we didn't make a decision yet. We tried offering a few solutions, such as, getting a babysitter or her boyfriends parents watch him for the night as her and her boyfriend will probably want the night off.. Or that the baby can be there for family pictures, or tucked away during the ceremony in another room. She really wants him there because she wants everyone to meet the baby, and she doesn't feel comfortable leaving the baby with a sitter.\n\nI told her ideally I didn't want him there, in case he started crying during the ceremony.  And I don't feel like my wedding is the time and place for her to show off her new baby. I want everyone to enjoy the day and have fun. I also feel like she will hand off the baby to my mom, preventing my mom from fully enjoying the day.\n\nThe next day she texted me and said she was removing herself from the wedding party. I thanked her for being honest with me, and that I was understanding where she was coming from. I then asked her if that meant that she wasn't coming to the wedding at all? it\u2019s been over a week and I got no reply. I also explained that all I was requesting of her is to stand during the ceremony. Show up 20 minutes before the ceremony and that\u2019s fine. She then proceeded to not come to my bachelorette party that same week, claiming we were doing activities she couldn't do. We went for a walk on the beach with coffee, out for lunch, and a painting class. \n\nI don't know if I'm over-reacting, as I don't have kids and don't want kids so I have a hard time seeing this from her point of view.", "created_utc": 1697332625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17844re/aita_for_not_wanting_my_nephew_at_my_wedding/", "score": 755, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fine. Your wedding, your choice.\n\nYour sister doesn't feel comfortable being separated from her newborn. Fine. Her baby, her choice.\n\nIts good that she stepped out as soon as she was sure that she wouldn't be able to be there.", "NAH.  You are within your right to have a child free wedding.  But it is also reasonable for your sister to not want to be separated from her newborn infant for several hours.  I agree that introducing a new baby at your wedding would draw attention away from the wedding celebration, but remember that while your wedding is huge for you, it is perfectly normal for a pregnant woman to not be up for socializing, and her pregnancy and newborn child is every bit as huge for her.  Your wedding doesn\u2019t trump her child and her child doesn\u2019t trump your wedding.\n\nIt sounds like this is just a case of bad timing.  If you and your sister have had a good relationship until now, I hope you both make the effort to get past the timing issue.  Your wedding is just one day.  And her child will only be a newborn infant a very short time. You two have the rest of your lives to be good sisters.", "NAH: I would absolutely not leave my baby without me for more than an hour or two at that age. A wedding they weren\u2019t invited to, I just wouldn\u2019t go. You don\u2019t want a tiny baby that should be with their mom at your wedding. The baby has a good mom that doesn\u2019t want to leave them so they stepped down with plenty of notice. This seems like your sister is respecting your wishes. No problem here at all", "NAH \n\nYou are allowed to have a child free wedding, I did too and not a single regret! That said two months is really young and she\u2019s not wrong to not want to leave him for an extended period at that age.", "2 months is too young for you to expect her to leave her baby with a sitter if you expect her there. If you aren\u2019t a mother you may not understand that however I wouldn\u2019t be going either if I was in your sisters position\n\nIf you expect and want your sister there that baby is welcomed too. If not then that\u2019s fine.", "Don't expect her to show up for your wedding. Her baby is only 2 months.", "NAH. It\u2019s totally fine to not want the baby at the wedding. You\u2019re right, much of the focus will be on the baby. \n\nHowever, your sister is fine to say she doesn\u2019t want to leave her two month old baby with a sitter. She may breastfeed (or not) and if so then she needs to be with her baby. And at two months postpartum, she may just not feel emotionally ready to be apart from her baby. And that\u2019s fine too. \n\nIt definitely sounds like she probably just shouldn\u2019t come. She doesn\u2019t want to leave her baby, you don\u2019t want baby there. Both are valid but there\u2019s not really any middle ground. Maybe your best bet is to take videos of the wedding your sister can see later, or maybe you mom can FaceTime the ceremony so your sister can see it.", "YTA for not giving her a clear answer much earlier.  \n\nYou aren't obligated to allow children, but then don't get upset if parents decline.  \n\nYour \"clarification\" that she just needs to show up 20 mins early and doesn't have to \"get ready\" is not the compromise you think it is.  I'll assume you offered that in good faith, but not having children yourself, you don't understand how unrealistic it is.  Most mothers of a 2 month old are by default as \"unready\" for a public event as it is possible to get.  It's a lot of work, and why on earth would she do that when she'd still have to get a sitter?\n\nI am sorry to say that regardless of your decision, the attention will not be only on you.  That is an unrealistic expectation. If the baby is there, people will want to see it.  If it's not there, they will ask for pictures and stories.  If your sister isn't there, some of the attendees will be judging you. And if you had no sister at all, well, there's other drama for people to discuss. \n\nNo bride and groom are so fascinating as to hold the single-minded attention of attendees for hours.", "NAH - a new baby is incompatible with a role in a wedding party. It's also fair enough that she doesn't want to leave an 8 week old baby for too long. If she's breastfeeding, she won't be able to leave the baby for much more than a few hours before her breasts start leaking, so she definitely won't want to leave the baby overnight.\n\nFocus on having her there for the ceremony. Maybe give her some flexibility by telling her she can decide closer to the day how long she can stay at the wedding.", "YTA \n\nSorry. \n\nBut a 2 month old baby can\u2019t really be left for hours at a time let alone a whole day or night. \n\nMaybe 30-60 minutes for the ceremony with a trusted someone. \n\nBut the baby would probably be breastfeeding. \n\nAlso lots of first time mothers wouldn\u2019t leave a 2 month old with babysitters. \n\nShe is kind of a double deal. Her and a baby or simply 30 minutes of her time. Maybe. \n\nShe\u2019s a new Mum. She has different priorities\n\nI don\u2019t even have kids. And even I can see she won\u2019t be parted from her baby \n\nSo you get both or none.", "NAH \n\nIf you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding that\u2019s fine but obviously that means some parents won\u2019t be able to come. \n\nHonestly, 8 weeks postpartum I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to leave my baby or go to a wedding. You\u2019re still healing and settling into a routine. However, everyone faces these things differently. \n\nSounds like the best solution is for sister & baby to stay home.", "YTA. I get what you\u2019re saying about having a childfree wedding, I\u2019d probably have a childfree wedding too if I was getting married (apart from my own children) and I think that\u2019s perfectly reasonable. But I think you should make an exception for your sister\u2019s two month old baby. (It would be unreasonable to expect her not to get pregnant because of your wedding)\n\nA two month old baby is likely to be breastfed and unable to be away from their mother. It\u2019s also likely to sleep a lot especially if she has him in a baby carrier on her chest. \n\nBeing a first time mother two months postpartum, she would potentially be anxious about leaving the baby, and won\u2019t be feeling 100% normal yet either \n\nYou can be clear about the crying and if he\u2019s unsettled she (or her husband) can move out of the room with him before he starts to cry \n\nShe is probably feeling incredibly stressed about this and doesn\u2019t want to miss her own sister\u2019s wedding. \n\nI was a bridesmaid at my best friend\u2019s childfree wedding and she was kind enough to let me bring my 4 month old baby who did not take a bottle. Her dad held her most of the time and when she lost the plot during speeches he took her outside and I went out to feed her. She didn\u2019t bother anyone, we didn\u2019t show her off but some people did admire her. The bride included. \n\nNon parents have no idea how hard it can be to organise a sitter and leave your babies and a little understanding of her situation would go a long way", "If by overreacting you mean taking it personally that she can't attend... maybe.  If you mean overreacting by sticking to no kids, no you aren't.  And, no, your wedding is not the appropriate time to introduce her baby to your family.  However, it is very possible that she will choose to remain home without her baby - as is her right.\n\nA two month old baby is very young, and she wouldn't be the first (especially first time) mother who didn't want to leave her baby behind that quickly.  That also is not personal - and she should not take you wanting your wedding to be child free personally.\n\nThis is just one of those things that happen - and unexpected circumstances make participation not possible.", "NAH... My daughter was 3 mos old when I left her home to attend my cousin's wedding. Biggest mistake ever. I spent half the night in the restroom, pumping & dumping. Eventually left early because I couldn't enjoy myself being away from my little one. I really hope your sister makes it to the ceremony, but please don't guilt or shame her if she misses the reception. Congratulations on your wedding!", "NTA. The invitations, after a year of planning, stated clearly it was an adult only wedding. Her sister absolutely wants to attend with a newborn, whom btw shouldn't be exposed at that age to various strangers some of whom may not be appropriately vaccinated, so she can show off the baby. She said she wants everyone to meet the baby. That's not the time or place for that. Period.\nShe offered for her sister to show up 20mins early, stand in the ceremony and leave. That was a suggestion, not a demand. She accepted her answer that she was dropping out of the wedding party. She told her she understood and thanked her. All she did then was ask a reasonable question \"does that mean you're not coming at all?\" And hasn't received a response. OP is NTA. This is her wedding day not \"meet a newborn\" day. \nOP has been waiting over a week to find out if her own sister is still going to be a guest at the wedding. \nMeanwhile her sister is concerned about leaving the baby with a sitter/family when she should be more concerned about having her 2 month old at a wedding. Ridiculous. \nThe sister isn't wrong for not wanting to leave her newborn. She isn't TA for that. She could at least tell OP whether or not she is coming to the wedding as a guest though.", "YTA - yeah you can refuse to have kids at your wedding.  But your sister can also think you\u2019re a complete jerk for not understanding she\u2019s not comfortable leaving her baby with a stranger when he\u2019s literallly a newborn.  She might be nursing.  Believe me she won\u2019t be having fun.  You can refuse to have a baby at the wedding and she can refuse to come to your wedding.  That\u2019s how that works.  I\u2019m wondering if you were ruder/ harsher than the picture you\u2019ve painted here.  Because it kind of seems like your sister is done with you.", "Ok, I think YTA a little, simply because you knew the answer would be no but you decided to dance around and not give a solid answer.\n\n>We said we would think about it, but ideally not. She's also standing in the wedding.\n\n>we said we didn't make a decision yet.\n\nYou shouldn't've lied to your sister, should have been an adult and owned your decision.  This is part of the YTA\n\nYou finally giver her your answer, and she decides to bow out. Both of you are cool here. \n\nBut then;\n\n>I also explained that all I was asking of her is to stand during the ceremony. She wouldn\u2019t even need to get ready with us. Show up 20 minutes before the ceremony and that\u2019s fine.\n\nNow you're starting to badger her. She made her choice just like you made yours. Time to drop the issue.\n\nProblem is, you're both having huge things happen in your lives, and both of you are treating the other like the huge thing happening is not a big deal. \n\nA wedding is a BFD and so your feelings are hurt that she'd pull away from this big part of your life.\n\nA baby is a BFD and so her feelings are hurt that you'd want her to leave that big part of her life at home away from your party.\n\nYou're both making non-asshole decisions and reacting to each other with hurt, in non asshole ways. \n\nLeave her alone and don't push her, or else you'll go from \"only the asshole because you couldn't find your spine\" and move to, \"also the asshole for pressuring someone when she's told you no.\"", "She hasn\u2019t had the baby yet and is being made to feel like he\u2019s a problem for you. At eight weeks, she may still be a hormonal wreck and the baby is just eating and sleeping. Not like he\u2019ll be a toddler running around like crazy. In 10 years time, you\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t taken this stance. A wedding is just a day, sisters and nephews are forever.", "I have a breastfed three month old who doesn\u2019t take a bottle.

Assuming your relationship is already good.\n\nI find the comments that you're NTA because all of the attention should be on you on your wedding day to be a bit ridiculous.  Wedding guests don't gaze upon the bride and groom with adoring rapt attention for the 12 hours typically spent at a wedding.  A baby attending doesn't make the day any less about you.  Having friends and family in attendance and being comfortable in attending is what matters.  Decide whether you'd rather stand your ground or have your sister with you at your wedding.", "YTA if you make her feel bad about not going to your wedding. I don\u2019t get this crap about being scared someone will take attention away from the bride. I felt like It\u2019s a party to celebrate with the people you love not this party to sit in awe of the bride. If the baby cries is it really that big of a deal? The dad gets up and steps out.

That way sis doesn\u2019t have to be too far from the baby, and you don\u2019t have a crying baby for the ceremony.

It\u2019s not reasonable to ask someone to leave a newborn with a babysitter.

Kids under 12 months should be the exception to child free events. They are relatively easily contained (especially at the age your sister\u2019s baby will be) and can be easily removed if they cry or need to be attended to in another way. Not to mention that many babies can only eat when the mother is there, again, at the age your sister\u2019s baby will be. Additionally, it is very mentally hard for some moms to leave their children during this time and not inviting the baby is essentially not inviting the mother.

We find them acceptable because in our culture we don\u2019t think children deserve full respect and therefore it is okay to treat them as inferior and it is okay to exclude them.

Me (F27) and my fianc\u00e9 (M28) are getting married in a few months. I've told my fianc\u00e9 from the start that I didn't want any kids at our wedding, and he agreed. We don't have any kids in our families, so that made it easy. We even put on our invitations that it was an adults only event. \n\nAlmost over a year into planning our wedding, my sister tells us she's having a baby 2 months before our wedding, and she jokingly asked if her baby was allowed. We said we would think about it, but ideally not. She's also standing in the wedding.\n\nLast week she called and said she needed an answer now, even though her baby isn't due for a couple months.. and we said we didn't make a decision yet. We tried offering a few solutions, such as, getting a babysitter for the night as her and her boyfriend will probably want the night off.. Or that the baby can be there for family pictures but that's it. She really wants him there because she wants everyone to meet the baby, and she doesn't feel comfortable leaving the baby with a sitter.\n\nI told her I didn't want him here, in case he started crying during the ceremony.  And I don't feel like my wedding is the time and place for her to show off her new baby. I want everyone to enjoy the day and have fun. I also feel like she will hand off the baby to my mom, preventing my mom from fully enjoying the day.\n\nThe next day she texted me and said she was removing herself from the wedding party. I asked her if that meant that she wasn't coming to the wedding at all, and I got no reply. She then proceeded to not come to my bachelorette party that same week, claiming we were doing activities she couldn't do. We went for a walk on the beach with coffee, out for lunch, and a painting class. \n\nI don't know if I'm over-reacting, as I don't have kids and don't want kids so I have a hard time seeing this from her point of view.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm s parent but I completely understand wanting a child-free event. You tried to find solutions, like a sitter, and your sister didn't feel comfortable with that. At this point she likely has no idea how she will be feeling two months after having her (first? Sounds like it.) baby. Her idea of using your event to introduce baby to the family seems selfish,  BUT only in the context that for some reason, modern weddings have become highly curated events that are more about the visuals and less about two people combining their lives. I hear brides, primarily, talking about \"my\" day/week, etc. The self-centeredness and narcissism of that really grates on me. So I'm wondering how understanding and compassionate you were with your communication. \n\nI had a baby two weeks before a friend's \"wedding.\" They had had the ceremony as a destination thing with only a few people a month prior, but this reception was essentially everything else, the whole enchilada. The reception was indeed child-free. My (now ex) husband was going to do the photography for the event and it would be a very big thing. The bride was a semi-professional model and photos mattered to her. So obviously he couldn't miss it. He had already been upset that he had to miss the ceremony (she wanted him to photograph it, was willing to pay his way, etc. But it was two weeks prior to my due date so I said no.) and he wasn't going to miss the reception.\n\nI totally and completely understood. She wasn't fond of children and didn't want them upsetting things. I was fine staying home with baby, who at two weeks was just too young for me to be OK with a sitter.

I made very sure my baby didn't cause any upheaval and was prepared to whisk her away if she got cranky. I was very aware that the couple was the center of attention (and should be!) so I was worried people would make a fuss over the baby. But you know what? It all went perfectly well. Baby snoozed for most of it. And there is a really adorable series of photos near the end of the evening when the bride wanted to hold her, and wound up cooing over her and dancing with her. (I won't lie, she was a gorgeous baby!) It all went so very smoothly.\n\nSo yeah, NTA. But I really think it's worth it taking your sister out for tea (or a pedicure, her feet must be killing her) and just talking about it. Tell her what you're fears are.

It never occur to me I need them to be in their best behavior. \n\nI find brides and groom these days have a low tolerance for interruptions. And want stuff to be Instagram perfect. Having said that, I never seen a kids at any wedding break stuff. So I dunno, maybe the group I know has better behave kids. \n\nI just think this is your sister that you like/love?

Asking if she would be attending at all would have been the right question. It also took her hounding you to get an answer on if she could bring baby.

Give each other a bit of space, this seems like the sort of disagreement that's bound to happen when two people are stressed, as you are with planning your wedding and she is with her preparations to have a baby.", "It's weird and a little pathetic that you think a newborn would \"upstage\" you", "The sister wanted to show off the baby at wedding and OP\u2019s reasonable suggestion to come for the ceremony, take some pictures and take off wouldn\u2019t allow her to do that. \nOP also made a point of telling her sister she wanted the baby in the pictures.", "I think the precise wording the OP used is important to whether it was an AH move.\n\n\"It's completely fine if you want to sit out because newborns are exhausting and you'll have other worries, but I just want you to know that it would also be fine with me if we bend over backwards to make sure the burden on you is minimal.\" is not bad. If it was more like \"Oh come on, you don't even really. have to do anything. Just show up 20 minutes before the ceremony. We've been planning for so long and it'll mess up the balance between the bridesmaids and the groomsmen if you're not there.\" is an AH move, and either one of these could plausibly be described by OP in the words she gave us.", "Holy heck. Humans have babies it\u2019s fine", "I agree. The baby will probably sleep a lot of the time anyway. Sister can wear the baby in a sling and it won\u2019t make a peep. Then people won\u2019t be passing it around, either (which makes me cringe thinking about all of the germs).", "I guess you have the right to be the only baby at your wedding", "Did this post mention anything about the wedding being out of state or did you just invent that part of the story?  Also, who is the attention-seeking adult you are referring to?", "Yes and most of the time, the baby slept through the whole thing.", "I doubt parents of a newborn would be passing the baby around. Usually when new parents introduce their baby to a crowd of people, the rule is look but don\u2019t touch. If OP wants a child free wedding she can do that, just don\u2019t expect the parents of a newborn to attend.", "um, it's not about not leaving the baby. it's about taking over OP's day and introducing the baby to everyone.", "giving potential solutions is not the same as trying to force someone. sister knew from before pregnancy that wedding was childfree, no reason to think otherwise was given.", "....you do realize butt and ass are synonyms...?", "Homie I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re unbalanced in bridesmaids vs groomsmen that\u2019s the least of my worries", "And it is fine for a couple to decide to host an adults only event.", "Now you get it", "I was giving a general example of what going out of your way to attend someone\u2019s wedding would look like. The attention seeking adult is OP. She doesn\u2019t want the baby at the wedding because she\u2019s afraid the baby will somehow take the spotlight off of her.", "In my experience, the other times, whoever is in charge of the baby thinks it\u2019s more important that they themselves don\u2019t miss anything than that they stop the disruption immediately by taking the baby outside. Nobody is an asshole for not wanting their wedding vows interrupted by a wailing baby.", "I don't understand this attitude. How can you take over a day? As long as you are ready to pop outside if the baby cries during anything important, how can it possibly detract? \n\nThe bridal couple are wildly busy and overwhelmed and barely speak to the guests anyway. The extended family and friends talk to each other all day, all catching up on each other's news. \n\nPeople hold babies, get drinks for brides, carry each other's plates, find a seat for oldies, cry at the vows, make awkward speeches, it's a celebration of your love within your extended community, a bearing witness by all who care for you young and old, that's what a wedding IS. I'll never understand these people that make these impossible ultimatums (get a babysitter for your infant child!?!) And then get upset when people don't attend.", "Isnt that kind of the purpose of weddings and funerals? Yes there is the main event but there are always sideshows. The entire family gets to meet and find out about new babies, new jobs, new BF/GF, new house etc. A wedding/funeral is the best time to catch up with your larger family.\n\nI dont get people who think a wedding is only about the bride and groom or a funeral is only about the dead person.", "Don\u2019t blow up your whole relationship with your sister over this. Come together face to face (zoom if you have to) and lay it all out. Tell her you want her there because you love her and she\u2019s your sister but you\u2019re afraid that baby might commandeer your mom\u2019s (and possibly others) attention to you and your big day. You both have areas where you can compromise and not let this ruin your relationship. NAH, I understand both of your points of view. As someone else said it\u2019s just shit timing unfortunately. \n\nWeddings and funerals to me always end up being ways for family to catch up. My own wedding was first and foremost about me and my husband, but it was also a last hurrah for my mom who was dying of cancer. The day was still focused on me and my husband, but lots of ppl definitely came for her and to say their goodbyes. You should have your day, but I can\u2019t fault your sister here for wanting to be near her newborn and for wanting to share him with family. So long as the day doesn\u2019t become all about her and baby you\u2019ll still have a wonderful day.", "As long as they gracefully accept people not coming without their kids.", "I wanted to make a better pun based on your username but imma little drunk and couldn't think of one", "I don\u2019t think that is a fair judgement on OP. Her and her husband had both agreed to host a child free event before said baby was even conceived. It is not fair to say she is attention-seeking for not changing the type of even she is throwing and allowing her sister to use it as a meet the baby party.", "Then you must know some really selfish people. Most decent people would take the baby out", "Maybe it's just my experience but I have definitely seen brand new babies \"take over\" an event, including a wedding (btw, not loving the term take over but it's what used).  Even more so if it's the first child or grandchild.  And while the OP certainly needs to be more accepting of her sister's no, the sister didn't really do herself any favors by saying she's going to used the event to introduce the kid to everyone, if she's wants to do that, great, have her own party, but she's didn't get to co-opt the wedding for it. All in all it sounds like ESH (except the baby).", "> As long as you are ready to pop outside if the baby cries during anything important, how can it possibly detract?\n\nShe quite literally told OP that she wanted the baby there so she could introduce the baby to everyone. So her desire is for the focus to be on her child, to take away from the wedding and make it a everyone meets the baby day. I don't have a clue how you can't understand that. No different to someone proposing during a wedding and taking attention away from the main couple. The couple getting married are usually paying anything from like 5-50k to celebrate THEIR wedding, not someone else's proposal or a nice event for everyone to meet their sister's kid.", "You would think this is a basic notion to grasp, but apparently not \ud83d\ude15\n   Where I live, we have children attend weddings. Maybe it is a math thing. Blended families with multiple kids isn't really frequent here, so there is not an overwhelming amount of kids.", "You really can\u2019t see why bringing a two *month* old to a child-free wedding is making it about the baby?", "My SO\u2019s family was huge. Weddings and funerals were treated like family reunions (with people coming from all over) with a \u201cmain event\u201d. \n\nComing from a small family it is was fun and amazing.", "I appreciate the thought though!", "It absolutely is fair to say that. People have always used weddings as opportunities to introduce their family to someone. How is this any different from someone bringing their partner to a family wedding so the extended family can finally meet them?\n\nOP is so afraid that someone will take their eyes off of her for one minute that she\u2019s willing to risk her sister not attending her wedding.", "Lots of people seem to become selfish and lose their sense of basic manners when they have a baby. It\u2019s one of the big reasons people have childfree weddings. You really seem to be taking OP\u2019s decision personally.", "You sound horribly judgmental. If a couple is getting married and funding an event, they get to choose how they want that event to function. This 100% includes the guest list.  Some people like formal events and some prefer a more casual party environment. Some couples want a small and intimate wedding while others invite everyone they\u2019ve ever met. Some prefer adults only and others enjoy having children-friendly events. None of these choices make the couple getting married selfish or attention-seeking. \n\nI think it is quite entitled and poor mannered for a guest to try to dictate the terms of an event they are invited to. I certainly hope you would never behave this way towards your friends and family members when they invite you to a function.", "I\u2019m not taking it personally. I just don\u2019t understand how you would rather your sister not attend you wedding than risk having a baby cry during your ceremony. I don\u2019t understand how anyone can want the perfect wedding so badly that they would exclude the people they love most to do it."]}
