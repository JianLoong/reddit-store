Me (F27) and my fianc\u00e9 (M28) are getting married in a few months. I've told my fianc\u00e9 from the start that I didn't want any kids at our wedding, and he agreed. We don't have any kids in our families, so that made it easy. We even put on our invitations that it was an adults only event. Our venue also only allows 5 children maximum, because children tend to break things accidentally. \n\nWell over a year into planning our wedding, my sister tells us she's having a baby 2 months before our wedding, and she jokingly asked if her baby was allowed. We said we would think about it, but ideally not. She's also standing in the wedding.\n\nLast week she called and said she needed an answer now, even though her baby isn't due for a couple months.. and we said we didn't make a decision yet. We tried offering a few solutions, such as, getting a babysitter or her boyfriends parents watch him for the night as her and her boyfriend will probably want the night off.. Or that the baby can be there for family pictures, or tucked away during the ceremony in another room. She really wants him there because she wants everyone to meet the baby, and she doesn't feel comfortable leaving the baby with a sitter.\n\nI told her ideally I didn't want him there, in case he started crying during the ceremony.  And I don't feel like my wedding is the time and place for her to show off her new baby. I want everyone to enjoy the day and have fun. I also feel like she will hand off the baby to my mom, preventing my mom from fully enjoying the day.\n\nThe next day she texted me and said she was removing herself from the wedding party. I thanked her for being honest with me, and that I was understanding where she was coming from. I then asked her if that meant that she wasn't coming to the wedding at all? it\u2019s been over a week and I got no reply. I also explained that all I was requesting of her is to stand during the ceremony. Show up 20 minutes before the ceremony and that\u2019s fine. She then proceeded to not come to my bachelorette party that same week, claiming we were doing activities she couldn't do. We went for a walk on the beach with coffee, out for lunch, and a painting class. \n\nI don't know if I'm over-reacting, as I don't have kids and don't want kids so I have a hard time seeing this from her point of view.", "created_utc": 1697332625, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17844re/aita_for_not_wanting_my_nephew_at_my_wedding/", "score": 3799, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fine. Your wedding, your choice.\n\nYour sister doesn't feel comfortable being separated from her newborn. Fine. Her baby, her choice.\n\nIts good that she stepped out as soon as she was sure that she wouldn't be able to be there.", "NAH.  You are within your right to have a child free wedding.  But it is also reasonable for your sister to not want to be separated from her newborn infant for several hours.  I agree that introducing a new baby at your wedding would draw attention away from the wedding celebration, but remember that while your wedding is huge for you, it is perfectly normal for a pregnant woman to not be up for socializing, and her pregnancy and newborn child is every bit as huge for her.  Your wedding doesn\u2019t trump her child and her child doesn\u2019t trump your wedding.\n\nIt sounds like this is just a case of bad timing.  If you and your sister have had a good relationship until now, I hope you both make the effort to get past the timing issue.  Your wedding is just one day.  And her child will only be a newborn infant a very short time. You two have the rest of your lives to be good sisters.", "NAH: I would absolutely not leave my baby without me for more than an hour or two at that age. A wedding they weren\u2019t invited to, I just wouldn\u2019t go. You don\u2019t want a tiny baby that should be with their mom at your wedding. The baby has a good mom that doesn\u2019t want to leave them so they stepped down with plenty of notice. This seems like your sister is respecting your wishes. No problem here at all", "NAH \n\nYou are allowed to have a child free wedding, I did too and not a single regret! That said two months is really young and she\u2019s not wrong to not want to leave him for an extended period at that age.", "2 months is too young for you to expect her to leave her baby with a sitter if you expect her there. If you aren\u2019t a mother you may not understand that however I wouldn\u2019t be going either if I was in your sisters position\n\nIf you expect and want your sister there that baby is welcomed too. If not then that\u2019s fine.", "Don't expect her to show up for your wedding. Her baby is only 2 months.", "NAH. It\u2019s totally fine to not want the baby at the wedding. You\u2019re right, much of the focus will be on the baby. \n\nHowever, your sister is fine to say she doesn\u2019t want to leave her two month old baby with a sitter. She may breastfeed (or not) and if so then she needs to be with her baby. And at two months postpartum, she may just not feel emotionally ready to be apart from her baby. And that\u2019s fine too. \n\nIt definitely sounds like she probably just shouldn\u2019t come. She doesn\u2019t want to leave her baby, you don\u2019t want baby there. Both are valid but there\u2019s not really any middle ground. Maybe your best bet is to take videos of the wedding your sister can see later, or maybe you mom can FaceTime the ceremony so your sister can see it.", "YTA for not giving her a clear answer much earlier.  \n\nYou aren't obligated to allow children, but then don't get upset if parents decline.  \n\nYour \"clarification\" that she just needs to show up 20 mins early and doesn't have to \"get ready\" is not the compromise you think it is.  I'll assume you offered that in good faith, but not having children yourself, you don't understand how unrealistic it is.  Most mothers of a 2 month old are by default as \"unready\" for a public event as it is possible to get.  It's a lot of work, and why on earth would she do that when she'd still have to get a sitter?\n\nI am sorry to say that regardless of your decision, the attention will not be only on you.  That is an unrealistic expectation. If the baby is there, people will want to see it.  If it's not there, they will ask for pictures and stories.  If your sister isn't there, some of the attendees will be judging you. And if you had no sister at all, well, there's other drama for people to discuss. \n\nNo bride and groom are so fascinating as to hold the single-minded attention of attendees for hours.", "NAH - a new baby is incompatible with a role in a wedding party. It's also fair enough that she doesn't want to leave an 8 week old baby for too long. If she's breastfeeding, she won't be able to leave the baby for much more than a few hours before her breasts start leaking, so she definitely won't want to leave the baby overnight.\n\nFocus on having her there for the ceremony. Maybe give her some flexibility by telling her she can decide closer to the day how long she can stay at the wedding.", "YTA \n\nSorry. \n\nBut a 2 month old baby can\u2019t really be left for hours at a time let alone a whole day or night. \n\nMaybe 30-60 minutes for the ceremony with a trusted someone. \n\nBut the baby would probably be breastfeeding. \n\nAlso lots of first time mothers wouldn\u2019t leave a 2 month old with babysitters. \n\nShe is kind of a double deal. Her and a baby or simply 30 minutes of her time. Maybe. \n\nShe\u2019s a new Mum. She has different priorities\n\nI don\u2019t even have kids. And even I can see she won\u2019t be parted from her baby \n\nSo you get both or none.", "NAH \n\nIf you don\u2019t want kids at your wedding that\u2019s fine but obviously that means some parents won\u2019t be able to come. \n\nHonestly, 8 weeks postpartum I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to leave my baby or go to a wedding. You\u2019re still healing and settling into a routine. However, everyone faces these things differently. \n\nSounds like the best solution is for sister & baby to stay home.", "YTA. I get what you\u2019re saying about having a childfree wedding, I\u2019d probably have a childfree wedding too if I was getting married (apart from my own children) and I think that\u2019s perfectly reasonable. But I think you should make an exception for your sister\u2019s two month old baby. (It would be unreasonable to expect her not to get pregnant because of your wedding)\n\nA two month old baby is likely to be breastfed and unable to be away from their mother. It\u2019s also likely to sleep a lot especially if she has him in a baby carrier on her chest. \n\nBeing a first time mother two months postpartum, she would potentially be anxious about leaving the baby, and won\u2019t be feeling 100% normal yet either \n\nYou can be clear about the crying and if he\u2019s unsettled she (or her husband) can move out of the room with him before he starts to cry \n\nShe is probably feeling incredibly stressed about this and doesn\u2019t want to miss her own sister\u2019s wedding. \n\nI was a bridesmaid at my best friend\u2019s childfree wedding and she was kind enough to let me bring my 4 month old baby who did not take a bottle. Her dad held her most of the time and when she lost the plot during speeches he took her outside and I went out to feed her. She didn\u2019t bother anyone, we didn\u2019t show her off but some people did admire her. The bride included. \n\nNon parents have no idea how hard it can be to organise a sitter and leave your babies and a little understanding of her situation would go a long way", "If by overreacting you mean taking it personally that she can't attend... maybe.  If you mean overreacting by sticking to no kids, no you aren't.  And, no, your wedding is not the appropriate time to introduce her baby to your family.  However, it is very possible that she will choose to remain home without her baby - as is her right.\n\nA two month old baby is very young, and she wouldn't be the first (especially first time) mother who didn't want to leave her baby behind that quickly.  That also is not personal - and she should not take you wanting your wedding to be child free personally.\n\nThis is just one of those things that happen - and unexpected circumstances make participation not possible.", "NAH... My daughter was 3 mos old when I left her home to attend my cousin's wedding. Biggest mistake ever. I spent half the night in the restroom, pumping & dumping. Eventually left early because I couldn't enjoy myself being away from my little one. I really hope your sister makes it to the ceremony, but please don't guilt or shame her if she misses the reception. Congratulations on your wedding!", "NTA. The invitations, after a year of planning, stated clearly it was an adult only wedding. Her sister absolutely wants to attend with a newborn, whom btw shouldn't be exposed at that age to various strangers some of whom may not be appropriately vaccinated, so she can show off the baby. She said she wants everyone to meet the baby. That's not the time or place for that. Period.\nShe offered for her sister to show up 20mins early, stand in the ceremony and leave. That was a suggestion, not a demand. She accepted her answer that she was dropping out of the wedding party. She told her she understood and thanked her. All she did then was ask a reasonable question \"does that mean you're not coming at all?\" And hasn't received a response. OP is NTA. This is her wedding day not \"meet a newborn\" day. \nOP has been waiting over a week to find out if her own sister is still going to be a guest at the wedding. \nMeanwhile her sister is concerned about leaving the baby with a sitter/family when she should be more concerned about having her 2 month old at a wedding. Ridiculous. \nThe sister isn't wrong for not wanting to leave her newborn. She isn't TA for that. She could at least tell OP whether or not she is coming to the wedding as a guest though.", "YTA - yeah you can refuse to have kids at your wedding.  But your sister can also think you\u2019re a complete jerk for not understanding she\u2019s not comfortable leaving her baby with a stranger when he\u2019s literallly a newborn.  She might be nursing.  Believe me she won\u2019t be having fun.  You can refuse to have a baby at the wedding and she can refuse to come to your wedding.  That\u2019s how that works.  I\u2019m wondering if you were ruder/ harsher than the picture you\u2019ve painted here.  Because it kind of seems like your sister is done with you.", "Ok, I think YTA a little, simply because you knew the answer would be no but you decided to dance around and not give a solid answer.\n\n>We said we would think about it, but ideally not. She's also standing in the wedding.\n\n>we said we didn't make a decision yet.\n\nYou shouldn't've lied to your sister, should have been an adult and owned your decision.  This is part of the YTA\n\nYou finally giver her your answer, and she decides to bow out. Both of you are cool here. \n\nBut then;\n\n>I also explained that all I was asking of her is to stand during the ceremony. She wouldn\u2019t even need to get ready with us. Show up 20 minutes before the ceremony and that\u2019s fine.\n\nNow you're starting to badger her. She made her choice just like you made yours. Time to drop the issue.\n\nProblem is, you're both having huge things happen in your lives, and both of you are treating the other like the huge thing happening is not a big deal. \n\nA wedding is a BFD and so your feelings are hurt that she'd pull away from this big part of your life.\n\nA baby is a BFD and so her feelings are hurt that you'd want her to leave that big part of her life at home away from your party.\n\nYou're both making non-asshole decisions and reacting to each other with hurt, in non asshole ways. \n\nLeave her alone and don't push her, or else you'll go from \"only the asshole because you couldn't find your spine\" and move to, \"also the asshole for pressuring someone when she's told you no.\"", "She hasn\u2019t had the baby yet and is being made to feel like he\u2019s a problem for you. At eight weeks, she may still be a hormonal wreck and the baby is just eating and sleeping. Not like he\u2019ll be a toddler running around like crazy. In 10 years time, you\u2019ll wish you hadn\u2019t taken this stance. A wedding is just a day, sisters and nephews are forever.", "I have a breastfed three month old who doesn\u2019t take a bottle.

Assuming your relationship is already good.\n\nI find the comments that you're NTA because all of the attention should be on you on your wedding day to be a bit ridiculous.  Wedding guests don't gaze upon the bride and groom with adoring rapt attention for the 12 hours typically spent at a wedding.  A baby attending doesn't make the day any less about you.  Having friends and family in attendance and being comfortable in attending is what matters.  Decide whether you'd rather stand your ground or have your sister with you at your wedding.", "YTA if you make her feel bad about not going to your wedding. I don\u2019t get this crap about being scared someone will take attention away from the bride. I felt like It\u2019s a party to celebrate with the people you love not this party to sit in awe of the bride. If the baby cries is it really that big of a deal? The dad gets up and steps out. Idk\u2026 I feel like a 2 month old just eats, sleeps and poops. If you want your sister there then let the baby come.

It should\u2019ve been more about figuring out how you can make it happen for your sister to be at the wedding.

That way sis doesn\u2019t have to be too far from the baby, and you don\u2019t have a crying baby for the ceremony.

It\u2019s not reasonable to ask someone to leave a newborn with a babysitter.

Kids under 12 months should be the exception to child free events. They are relatively easily contained (especially at the age your sister\u2019s baby will be) and can be easily removed if they cry or need to be attended to in another way. Not to mention that many babies can only eat when the mother is there, again, at the age your sister\u2019s baby will be. Additionally, it is very mentally hard for some moms to leave their children during this time and not inviting the baby is essentially not inviting the mother.

We find them acceptable because in our culture we don\u2019t think children deserve full respect and therefore it is okay to treat them as inferior and it is okay to exclude them.

Me (F27) and my fianc\u00e9 (M28) are getting married in a few months. I've told my fianc\u00e9 from the start that I didn't want any kids at our wedding, and he agreed. We don't have any kids in our families, so that made it easy. We even put on our invitations that it was an adults only event. \n\nAlmost over a year into planning our wedding, my sister tells us she's having a baby 2 months before our wedding, and she jokingly asked if her baby was allowed. We said we would think about it, but ideally not. She's also standing in the wedding.\n\nLast week she called and said she needed an answer now, even though her baby isn't due for a couple months.. and we said we didn't make a decision yet. We tried offering a few solutions, such as, getting a babysitter for the night as her and her boyfriend will probably want the night off.. Or that the baby can be there for family pictures but that's it. She really wants him there because she wants everyone to meet the baby, and she doesn't feel comfortable leaving the baby with a sitter.\n\nI told her I didn't want him here, in case he started crying during the ceremony.  And I don't feel like my wedding is the time and place for her to show off her new baby. I want everyone to enjoy the day and have fun. I also feel like she will hand off the baby to my mom, preventing my mom from fully enjoying the day.\n\nThe next day she texted me and said she was removing herself from the wedding party. I asked her if that meant that she wasn't coming to the wedding at all, and I got no reply. She then proceeded to not come to my bachelorette party that same week, claiming we were doing activities she couldn't do. We went for a walk on the beach with coffee, out for lunch, and a painting class. \n\nI don't know if I'm over-reacting, as I don't have kids and don't want kids so I have a hard time seeing this from her point of view.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm s parent but I completely understand wanting a child-free event. You tried to find solutions, like a sitter, and your sister didn't feel comfortable with that. At this point she likely has no idea how she will be feeling two months after having her (first? Sounds like it.) baby. Her idea of using your event to introduce baby to the family seems selfish,  BUT only in the context that for some reason, modern weddings have become highly curated events that are more about the visuals and less about two people combining their lives. I hear brides, primarily, talking about \"my\" day/week, etc. The self-centeredness and narcissism of that really grates on me. So I'm wondering how understanding and compassionate you were with your communication. \n\nI had a baby two weeks before a friend's \"wedding.\" They had had the ceremony as a destination thing with only a few people a month prior, but this reception was essentially everything else, the whole enchilada. The reception was indeed child-free. My (now ex) husband was going to do the photography for the event and it would be a very big thing. The bride was a semi-professional model and photos mattered to her. So obviously he couldn't miss it. He had already been upset that he had to miss the ceremony (she wanted him to photograph it, was willing to pay his way, etc. But it was two weeks prior to my due date so I said no.) and he wasn't going to miss the reception.\n\nI totally and completely understood. She wasn't fond of children and didn't want them upsetting things. I was fine staying home with baby, who at two weeks was just too young for me to be OK with a sitter.

I made very sure my baby didn't cause any upheaval and was prepared to whisk her away if she got cranky. I was very aware that the couple was the center of attention (and should be!) so I was worried people would make a fuss over the baby. But you know what? It all went perfectly well. Baby snoozed for most of it. And there is a really adorable series of photos near the end of the evening when the bride wanted to hold her, and wound up cooing over her and dancing with her. (I won't lie, she was a gorgeous baby!) It all went so very smoothly.\n\nSo yeah, NTA. But I really think it's worth it taking your sister out for tea (or a pedicure, her feet must be killing her) and just talking about it. Tell her what you're fears are.

It never occur to me I need them to be in their best behavior. \n\nI find brides and groom these days have a low tolerance for interruptions. And want stuff to be Instagram perfect. Having said that, I never seen a kids at any wedding break stuff. So I dunno, maybe the group I know has better behave kids. \n\nI just think this is your sister that you like/love?

Asking if she would be attending at all would have been the right question. It also took her hounding you to get an answer on if she could bring baby.

It's fine but to want a new baby disturbing and taking attention during your wedding. It's also fine that sister wants that decision and can't be away from her baby at that age.

So yeah, I'm leaning NAH, because while I'm frustrated with OP's waffling and handling of sis, it's not enough to qualify as an AH. Just human.", "The invite said no kids - so what was so special about her that she needed to ask.

OP had to know that by banning a newborn that the mom probably wouldn\u2019t come and that she was in effect not only kicking her sister out of the wedding party but also from attending.

Then store that milk if she doesn\u2019t want to just dump good milk down the drain. Also if she doesn\u2019t have the portable in-bra pumps, which not everyone can get as insurance covers one pump per pregnancy, she'd have to find somewhere to sit and pump, maybe while partially undressed as many formal wear options do not have great access for the pump+bottle setup.\nMy best friend went through this exact scenario earlier this year, and i genuinely have no clue why she bothered, hearing about all the steps. My baby is EBF entirely by nursing, because pumping was just not at all a thing i could manage, and I quietly bowed out of attending a wedding last month for this reason.

My nephew was puking up after every feeding and they were trying to figure out the problem. Many infants at that age are in the middle of a growth spurt and need to be fed extra.

Bring baby, it gets exposed to a lot of germs, attracts attention, and is super distracting to the person caretaking, and the family's routines get disrupted. It sucks. Don't bring the baby, and the mom will be super distracted, anyway. People will still ask about the baby, drawing attention to the absence, and for a nursing mom, there needs to be time set aside for pumping.\n\nOP's sister not attending the wedding, or only the ceremony, makes sense if OP doesn't take it personally. It's a logistical decision.", "She explicitly said she wanted to show off the baby", "She might have felt like shit that day. She might have been frustrated at her sister. Not really enough info to say one way or the other.", "Depending on how far along she is and her pregnancy, mobility may be an issue. When I was heavily pregnant, sometimes going for a walk was difficult when my baby\u2019s head was resting on my cervix. Felt like I was waddling. If they\u2019re already doing the bachelorette party and baby will already be two months by the wedding date, I would assume that she\u2019s very heavily pregnant. Beaches can also have strong smells that may cause sensitivities for pregnant women (sense of smell actually increases in pregnancy as does aversions to particular foods and scents). They are going for coffee too, which most pregnant women choose to avoid due to the fact that caffeine is a stimulant that can potentially be harmful to an unborn child. It is totally understandable that the sister is unwilling to attend the bachelorette party. She\u2019s probably hurt from the newborn exclusion as well, so would be understandably less willing to put herself in an uncomfortable or awkward situation when her sister won\u2019t do the same for her. If the sister is breastfeeding, it is very difficult to leave a newborn. At two months, the baby is still a newborn and both mom and baby are adjusting to breastfeeding. The baby may be unable to take a bottle and be fed another way at that point. The new mother may be dealing with issues such as leaking and engorgement by being separated from her newborn for an extended period of time. Newborn babies are very unlikely to detract from a wedding or cause a scene. The only time they cry is when they\u2019re hungry, wet, or alone. Unless the sister has a hang-up with a baby being discretely held and nursed at a wedding, there should be no need to refuse the baby when you want the mother in your wedding party and have such a strong familial connection with the newborn in question.", "Because not everyone wants to do those things?", "Absolutely.  My in-laws went to a wedding last month, from photos it looked like an outdoor wedding and reception, and they still both ended up with Covid.  There's no way I'd take a newborn to a big event with a lot of people, especially during flu season.", "Or did she?\n\nYeah, i know thats what the OP wrote, but is it really what her sister said?

Yet she cant stand that her sister withdrew from the wedding in favor of the soon-to-be nephew. I dont clarification is needed, do you? \n\nIf the 2 month old newborn can't be at the wedding, neither can his mom.

You're mingling with people and conversations are going on about all sorts of things. You're not spending the night just talking about the bride and how fucken beautiful the centrepieces are. Some people throughout the night looking at a baby is not attention away from the wedding. If a baby cries during the ceremony you step out with the baby.

And they think the first and best solution is to every problem is to cut out family.\n\nBecause obviously the most important part of a wedding isn\u2019t celebrating with your family and friends. It\u2019s making sure there are no moments where your third cousin is thinking about a baby instead of you. Pathetic.", "SO can keep the baby. It is not fair to use their wedding as an intro to the new baby. They put a lot of time and money into the wedding to have her use it to show off the baby.", "OH FFS! You\u2018re really reaching here. She could have had herbal tea instead of coffee. She could have called the studio to ask whether the paints were safe. She could very likely have done lunch. I mean, she has to eat lunch anyway, right?   \n\n\nSome folks here are making it seem like all pregnant women are incapacitated for the entire nine months."]}
