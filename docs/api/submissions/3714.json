Some people have made some reasonable suggestions here in the comments (an odd number of treats, she's got a schedule for what she serves when, etc.) but you shouldn't have to rely on reddit to tell you what your wife is thinking.  This is piss poor marital communication and her outright refusal to explain exactly why she's mad about the dunkaroos--instead demanding that you read her mind and then punishing you for getting it wrong--has turned a simple, extremely fixable problem into a huge fight.  That's on her.\n\nNow, where can I buy these dunkaroos in the US?", "NTA \n\nMom of two kids here who does *all* of the grocery shopping alone. \n\nI legit have no clue what is going on here. I suspect this isn't really about the snack, though. Once you're both calm, try talking to her about it.", "NTA, what is your wife\u2019s deal? You don\u2019t have to ask permission to eat snacks in your own home. I would understand if you polished the box off and never notified her you need to get more. But in a brand new box it will make no difference. You can replace them before it ever makes a difference", "NTA My friend I think you are being financially abused. And that's weird because you are the breadwinner. Your wife seems to have control issues.", "NTA. That is a weird reaction. Makes no sense. \n\nMy ex-wife used to do this sort of thing all the time.

I \u201cshould just know\u201d. \n\nNote I said ex-wife. That BS gets old.", "NTA. I'd eat them too. \nI always buy 3 boxes of whatever snacks at this point. \nOne for me, one for hubby and one for the kiddo because neither of us has any self control around tasty garbage snacks.

It's not like you ate them all or left the kids short.  You made the dunkaroos whole.", "NTA - there is not one logical reason for becoming upset. The food in the pantry is there to eat.

I also cannot figure out what you did wrong.", "NTA  by this, you should not be able to eat anything in your own house unless your wife approves. Perhaps you should get a basket for each person in the house and divide all snacks into separate baskets.", "NTA. It\u2019s baffling. And sorry, I got nothing.", "NTA. You help pay for the food.

What happened to you dude? When did you start allowing your wife to lose all respect for you and treat you like one of the children? You're ok with this? You're truly happy living like this?? You're not a child for eating dunkaroos they are the tits, but how an adult allows himself to be treated like this blows my mind.

You bought the damn snacks.  I assure you, the kids will be fine wiht one less pack of dunakaroos.", "The mistake? Obviously marrying the wrong person! \n\nKidding, of course. \n\nNTA and this really doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Hopefully this type of thing is not a common occurrence.", "NTA.  You replaced it.  I would have a bigger conversation about snacks and make sure you have some snacks that are fair game and discuss if this issue is these are single serve and your kids each think they had 3 days of snack or if she had planned out the snacks and this derailed her plan.", "ESH - While dunkaroos are delicious and I fully understand why you helped yourself to one, I think there\u2019s something unsaid between the two of you. You two need to talk through what just happened and why it resulted in the reactions it did. \n\nAs a parent, I LOVE when snacks/food are easily equally divided among my kids. That way I\u2019m never left with the dreaded last one that goes to\u2026 my favorite?!? I have to wonder if you tend to create an odd number of treats that results in a headache for your wife. While easy enough to solve (obviously mom gets a dunkaroo), having to deal with that battle repeatedly, or promising the kids a snack and then finding only 1 left, can totally wear a parent down. \n\nTalk to your wife.", "NTA, but you might apologize anyway, and ask her to please explain, because *I* don\u2019t get why she\u2019s so upset, either.", "I feel like, yeah, it\u2019s probably not that  much of a big deal, but it may have been that actually your wife had accounted for the number of snack or whatever to tide the kids over until the next shop, it may be that now, there are two kids and an odd number of dunkaroos and so they will be fighting over the last one. I don\u2019t know. You probably should have asked her why it was such a big deal. \n\nOffering to give her the money for them was passive aggressive. Buying a new pack and taking the other feels passive aggressive too. \n\nI\u2019d say NAH.

Small things like this help the Reddit community come together.\n\n>The left over money, after bills, goes into our kids college funds and our savings.\n\nGroceries come under bills.

Like, someone just flies off the handle over a single packet of cookies and is still grumpy even when you immediately replace it? No. So, this is obviously tied to a bigger, reoccurring argument in your relationship. So NTA for the cookies but you must know what this is really about, surely?
