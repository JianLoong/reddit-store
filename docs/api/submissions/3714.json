I don\u2019t know. You probably should have asked her why it was such a big deal. \n\nOffering to give her the money for them was passive aggressive.

It doesn't sound like it was an important snack but as a SAHM she probably does most the parenting therefore sees things you don't. For example I get upset when my husband eats my kids snacks from Walmart because it means I need to go restock sooner that planned. I hate going in our local Walmart and I hate the traffic to get there. It takes up my whole afternoon whenever I go. My husband fixes this by doing the next shopping trip for me. \nI also don't appreciate it when I buy things in sets of twos and now I have an odd number of things for the kids. I know that if one gets one and the other doesn't it will be a fight. My husband doesn't deal with those, I do so I don't appreciate him leaving me to clean up the emotional mess. \nIt may seem small, silly and/or unimportant but when this is your job those things matter.

Snacks are snacks", "We have similar rules about food in our house, so I guess I'm also an asshole. Growing up, there was no food that was mine. Order food at a restaurant, my mother would eat hers and then help herself to mine. If I was given a candy bar by a neighbor, she got half. My halloween candy had to be dumped into the bowl to pass out to more trick-or-treaters. It effected the way I view food. My husband has been forked when he did not stop eating off my plate after asking nicely. I love to share food, but only after I offer. I do not buy sweets often for my kids, it was a big deal to them when I did. If I came home with a 6-pack of dunkaroos, they would excitedly talk about how they each get one for 3 days. Now if my husband snagged one, I would have to explain to 2 excited little girls that now they only get two and be the one to deal with the fallout. It's happened and I have snapped at him for it. He is a grown man, with money and a car. If he wanted a sweet, he can always go get one or ask me to grab him some. He could also mention to the kids that he wanted one and they would be happy to share with their dad.

You need to actually figure out what's bugging your wife (and I'm sorry, because I know we are simple yet complicated creatures) because you're pushing a button that might cause an explosion you had no idea was even on the horizon. \n\nListen, it could be as simple as, you have the opportunity to buy yourself snacks and you don't and maybe the way she buys snacks for the kids is a plan that you are not aware of. \n\nI map out snacks, dinner, supper, and desserts and but to utilize vs build up stock so when someone messes with that, even unintentionally, if throws off the entire plan for the week. \n\nMaybe it's rooted to something else that is bugging her and either she's not communicating or you just ain't getting it. \n\nBut just say, hey, honey, um, clearly this is not about the dunkaroos so why don't you just talk to me and tell me what's bugging you. \nAnd then you have healthy communication and dunkaroos for all.", "NTA, she needs to really think this over. Maybe something else is bothering her, and she is taking it out on the guy who ate the dunkaroos.

I would see what she is stressed about.\n\nNTA for one single pack\u2026especially if you both will be going shopping\u2026but I do think it is courteous to ask in case there was something else (ie, extra event that required more snacks or friends coming over). \n\nI think saying you will pay her $0.50 is dismissive. I would recommend apologizing. If someone takes a food item, it\u2019s not just cost. It\u2019s now time to make a separate trip just for an item (which was likely not necessary in this case). An example of that would be using garlic when I had to make a meal with that ingredient that night.

Next morning I went to get one, mainly to insure I actually got 1. Nope, he had eaten the rest! Ate 4 of them in less than 24 hours despite me telling him how much I wanted them and asking him not to eat anymore! He literally did not even leave me one!

They were usually very wealthy and could absolutely afford to give me snacks (which they did happily) but my mom had some rules for me.

Kids need to learn candys not important but when you\u2019re a mom dealing with two kids alone during the day you relish those moments of peace. Easy solution, ask her to include a pack for him when she goes shopping or he starts grabbing a pack for himself.
