We found a 2br we liked, toured the model room, and decided it was perfect for us! \n\nA few days after we signed the lease, the family that is living there now contacted me. They said that they were served an eviction notice because of a mistake with the auto-pay feature of their rent. They didn\u2019t see the warning notice, and the landlord company put their apartment up for availability before they could get their finances together to pay everything back. \n\nThey were allowed to re-sign, but couldn\u2019t get their exact unit because we had already taken it. The property manager said he would be willing to let them have it only if my boyfriend and I agreed to switch. \n\nThe thing is, while the units are identical on the inside, the outsides are completely different. The unit we signed for faces the community garden, whereas the one they want us to switch to faces a busy street. There is no third option where we could find another unit within the complex, and we cant break the signed lease to go somewhere else. I felt bad for them, but I wouldn\u2019t have signed if the only available unit was facing the main road. I said sorry, but no.\n\nThey tried to argue with me, saying that the interiors are the same and the street isn\u2019t that noisy, but I stood firm. They then accused me of stealing from their family and taking their home, and that I was going to cost them hundreds of dollars in moving fees, but I still didn\u2019t budge. \n\nEventually they did have to move. We moved in last month and I\u2019ve seen them around a few times. Today I saw the father out getting the mail and he sneered and spit at the ground. \n\nWhile I feel bad about their situation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really my fault. I could be wrong though.

Failure to plan ahead on their part does not constitute an emergency on your part.  I doubt they were evicted after 1 missed rent payment.", "NTA, location matters.

I\u2019m sorry that happened to them, but it\u2019s not your problem. You shouldn\u2019t have to switch to a worse unit because they didn\u2019t check to make sure the rent was paid.", "NTA.  You have to pay your rent.  It sucks, but it wasn\u2019t your fault and you got the apartment you were promised.", "NTA\n\nI doubt it was one month of the auto pay not going through that ended up with the eviction and I\u2019m sure there was more than one notice.\n\nI understand them wanting to stay, but they need to take it up with the management company and maybe when a garden facing one is available, they can have that.\n\nIt\u2019s not your job to fix their mess.

It feels incredibly inappropriate that they contacted you directly. Any communication should have been handled through the leasing office.", "NTA. I would have a lot more sympathy for these people if it was a mistake on the side of the apartment complex but, how can you not notice for months that you aren\u2019t paying your rent and also miss a warning.

They knew when their payment was due and adults, especially with families, do keep track of their banking. It would be convenient for them to not have to move but that isn't your fault.

None of that is your problem though - you saw an apartment and you rented it. That's that.", "This was before we moved in and they were still living there when they contacted us.

The only way i'd consider that is if the property manager let me out of the lease. No way I'm taking the lesser apartment. They never would have signed the lease for that apartment in the first place", "Also, their bank balance should have reflected that the rent payment was still there.", "That was my first thought. It had to be more than one month", "I was pretty upset by this. Apparently they just gave them my name and they found me on facebook. They thankfully dont have my phone number or anything like that.", "It was the bank screw up, I\u2019m told. They flagged the auto pay as fraud or something", "While I agree with the general sense of your post, if this is in the US, it may or may not take awhile for eviction.

Landlord friendly laws make it possible in as few as 10 days.", "They got served, but I dont think there was a hearing, or if there was they didn\u2019t know about it.

I find it hard to believe that they didn't get proper notice before an eviction was posted. Sounds more like they were well behind and came up with the money last minute. I've had late bills before, and they will find every way to let you know.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDefinitely talk to the landlord with your lawyer about handing out personal information.

Management could have given you the option to free you from the lease provided that was something you would have agreed to.\n\nI also don't understand how it could cost them hundreds to move. In my experience if you are moving within the same complex, it is relatively cheap to do because you can move all of your boxes yourself. That only leaves some furniture - you don't have to rent a truck. if you are past the stage where you use friends to help, you can hire some teenagers to help move the larger stove with a dolly.", "This is managements issue not yours.You and your partner paid for what you wanted and shouldn\u2019t have to switch or compromise with strangers for what you paid for.", "NTA -  \"property manager said he would be willing to let them have it only if my boyfriend and I agreed to switch.\"  Your property manager is a weasel.

If they're still harboring a grudge, better safe than sorry.", "NTA but I\u2019d be concerned about a landlord who moves to evict before even communicating with the tenants (!) and also gives out personal information of their tenants to other tenants.

It's not obe missed payment, lease automatically terminated, out you go! They're trying to make it sound like OP only got the apartment because of a computer error, but such a swift eviction process would be 100% illegal, and they're obviously not the type who would have had a problem appealing their eviction. NTA", "I thought the same thing, either they were completely not paying attention and didn\u2019t notice the several months of rent piling up in their account, or they intentionally didn\u2019t pay and tried to use a banking error as an excuse. \nNeither situation is OP\u2018s, or even the management\u2019s, fault.", "You really believe people can be automatically evicted for a missed auto pay without a lengthy appeal and legal process?", "They shouldn't have even given them your name. That was extremely unprofessional, and depending on laws where you live, maybe illegal.", "At most the leasing agent should have asked if you were willing and when you weren\u2019t they should\u2019ve told the family that it was against policy to ask and they\u2019d have to change units. The blame/responsibility should never have been put on you.", "That\u2019s a big safety issue talk to a free clinic for a lawyer and see if it\u2019s a way you can break your lease and make the management company give you your deposit back along with moving fees to find another place.", "This. I definitely would notice if my mortgage wasn\u2019t coming out of my account and be calling ASAP", "Exactly, they wouldn't have \"needed time to get the money together\" because the one month  of unpaid rent would have still been sitting in their account.", "Yes. I've seen eviction notices triggered that way, and they were allowed to re-sign before they had even left the apartment OP wanted.", "Yeah, my rent didn't come out until like noon yesterday and I was checking it every hour lol", "And what's the legal process afterwards to force someone to leave? How long does it take? How many interactions with the court or sheriff does it entail?"]}
