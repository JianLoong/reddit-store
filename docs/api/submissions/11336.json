Among other things, they're lying.\n\nThe first thing that happens after someone fails to pay their rent is a written notice to either pay rent or move out. That typically requires a notice period of 3 days or more. And it's typically taped to your door so the landlord can take a picture and prove they gave you the required written notice.

However, if the stipulations in the plan are not met (i.e. catching up on late payments), the process typically begins again.", "Yes, that happened to me. The management office called me to say the previous tenants changed their mind and wanted to stay in the apartment. They told me it was up to me and I didn't have to agree to let them keep it. They also had to push my move in date, which was fine. It ended up being perfect for me. That's crazy they gave them your name. I am a private person, I would not have moved there. That is a breach of security.", "I mean, they'll have their address either way...", "Yes - excellent suggestion. I would hate being stuck in a hostile environment when the contract is with the person who facilitated making it that way.

I have it set up as automatic so I don't have to worry about it.", "Totally irrelevant.", "100% I get paranoid I am forgetting something", "This was also before they moved in.", "NTA. I worked multifamily housing for many years and this was a perennial problem. We'd have people put in notice that they were moving then neglect to vacate.

We had to put a clause in our leases stating people would face a significant financial hit ($250-$500) if they failed to vacate after giving notice. This put a stop to the problem. \n\nIt's their fault for getting so behind on their finances that the landlord put the unit on the market.

On the fourth of every month, they slip a sheet of paper through the door (between the edge of the door and the frame).  Before the eviction notice was filed, they had to have received a letter from the management company.  Autopay pulls money from a person's bank account.  Since the autopay didn't go through, the money never left their account.  The fact that they had more money in their account than they should have had to have alerted them to the fact that something had gone wrong.  I noticed an extra $125 in my account when my cable company failed to do their draw.  I'm sure their rent was even more noticeable than that small amount.  How did they blow through the rent money without realizing they were spending more money than they should have had available to spend?\n\nYou were shown that particular apartment.  I'm sure a big part of the attraction was the view and the fact that it was fairly quiet.  They lost the apartment because they didn't take care of their business.

Eviction for nonpayment where I lived could\u2019ve been completed in 10 days out the door.", "Not necessarily depending on the state it can start within a week or two of a single non/late payment to begin eviction process.", "I bet that street really is that noisy and they knew it, trying to pass the noise off as minimal. But you can get used to a quiet community garden view really quick.", "Hundreds probably not, but it can cost you money to get all your utilities switched plus cable/internet if you have it, not to mention updating your address on all your financials.", "It sucks but honestly you should probably run from this situation because the fact that the landlord gave then your name is pretty distressing", "I would have just blocked them upon receiving a message. Like sorry, i don't talk to strangers", "But that is still a huge privacy violation.  Not professional at all.", "Yah, the previous tenants played a stupid game and didn't like the prize they were awarded.", "[removed]", "I would have a lot of doubts about renting from them. Have you spoken to the property manager?", "NTA. AND...if this is in the USA, their story of eviction doesn't totally add up either.", ">\tplaced on your kitchen counter by maintenance. Management has your address.  They have the keys to your place.\n\nIs that really a thing in the US? That would be so illegal where I\u2019m from.", "Same. I even have a reminder in my phone for the first of every month to give my account a once over and make sure my bills are being paid. \n\nAt the start of this year, I had an autopay set that wasn\u2019t automatically adjusted for an increase in the monthly fee, and I definitely would\u2019ve been hit with late fees if I hadn\u2019t noticed that what was being taken out of my account was less than expected.", "But they wouldn\u2019t have until they\u2019d already moved out and harassing OP would have been pointless.", "That\u2019s exactly what they should\u2019ve done! They just didn\u2019t want to be the bad guys, so they let OP take the fall.", "Oh man that was me. I checked my bank account and was pleasantly surprised at how large it was. The next day I woke up freaking out cause I remembered I forgot to pay the bills. Not worry the heart attack.", "Yta. Seriously should have just demanded your money back\u2026 uprooting people was not nice", "NTA and I think they leaving a lot out of them being evicted.", "NTA\n\nIt's the owner's fault.  They have cruel unreasonable rules.\n\nBe careful not to lose your apartment by missing a payment.\n.\nFind a way of dealing with the abuse though (spitting).  \n\nYou could sympathise, politely point out that the situation is not your fault and gently warn them that you won't tolerate abuse.  Better to try a  kind personal approach before involving lawyers.", "NTA\n\nThe way that family reacted was completely out of line. Your argument for refusing to move is sound and just the accusation of stealing (not to mention the spitting) shows that they are small minded, uneducated and, probably, not too smart.", "If they think switching is no big deal and it\u2019s all the same, then why do they care about which apartment they\u2019re in? Nta", "NTA", "NTA, consider filing a complaint of harassment with your landlords. I would get a paper trail going. I\u2019d want it in writing how aggressive he was being towards you and include any messages they might have sent you not knowing who they were in the first place.", "NTA. You want the unit you rented and they dropped the ball. How do you not notice you didn\u2019t pay your rent? How much money do you have to have?", "Wow, you are SO NTA!  It sucks for them, for sure, but the AH credit goes to the property management side of things, and to them, the previous renters, for not paying closer attention to something with big consequences (like whether or not a big online payment cleared with a slumlord who has a policy to rent the place to a new tenant within the same month!). Mistakes were made, yes, and that's a shame, but especially bc you can't get out of the lease, you should not have to choose the lesser of the two units when that wasn't what you signed on to. I just hope the place is cleaned decently for you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know where you live, but eviction isn\u2019t just being served a notice and a follow-up. Typically, there are court days and the whole process takes several months. This couple is bullshitting you if they claimed everything happened so fast that they couldn\u2019t get money together on time. Also, your management company would not allow someone who they evicted over non-payment of rent to move back in, especially when they spent money to have them kicked out. Someone is lying to you.", "Hundreds of dollars in moving fees, to move within the same building? Sounds fishy", "NTA. These are the consequences of their own action, and everyone knows this is not just about an automatic payment mistake. You don't just let that go on auto and not check if it is paid or not. They didn't pay and apparently have found a way to pay fast now to not be completely homeless. \n\nIf they are practically the same, then what does it matter where they go to live? It's about the costs, they probably don't have that money and tried to convince you so they could save some money. \n\nYou said yes to an appartement, not a block of appartments. It sucks for them, but these are the consequences of their own actions. \n\nAlso, make an official complaint at the company for breaching your privacy. Saw they gave your name away.", "the fat he spat on the ground shows me what type of people they are..\n\nNTA OP", "I would say really soft YTA, not really your fault but they were also thrown in a unexpected situation where you had control of their outcome. \nIt was just a unfortunate situation for both of you. It was in your right to move to the unit as it\u2019s in theirs to hate you.", "They know where she lives", "Ummm, they know where they live?", "They should have contacted you with the question themselves & then told them that due to legal issues or company policy they couldn't keep the unit. They *never* should have given anything concerning you to them. You're NTA, but management is for not doing their job & putting you at risk by giving out your information.", "Yeah this is a problem and I'd be having words with the landlord, especially after this latest interaction with them.  This is bullshit.", "It was before they moved in.", "Or earlier if the apartment managers are assholes like mine were.", "What hostile environment? So a neighbor doesn't like you. Big deal. I've lived in the same apartment for 10+ years. I don't even know my neighbour's names. OP can literally ignore this person. It's not like they will have anything to do with each other.", "Bot, partial comment from 3 hours previous to this one", "Same lol. Apparently a lot of people on Reddit check their account much more than I do. Maybe I\u2019m doing this all wrong but I assume my autopays go through if I don\u2019t hear anything and I only check my balance every few months."]}
