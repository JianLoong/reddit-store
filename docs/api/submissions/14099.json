I also see why the 14-year-old gets frustrated (kids are so equity minded when it comes to their siblings getting out of chores!). Maybe it would be reasonable to say that they can do their chores after their friends leave. These chores do sound pretty quick, and I think if they need to have their friend leave 15 minutes early so they can do their chores, that's reasonable. (But you, as the parent, can also just say \"these are the rules, and I am sorry they frustrate you\" if you want!)", "NTA\n\nLook, I had\u2026issues with fairness between me and my sibling growing up.

Unless 14 has to Swiffer 12\u2019s bedroom when 12\u2019s friends are over, or if 14 is doing bathroom chores multiple days in a row while 12 doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s really not a big deal.\n\nPerhaps you could compromise that if 12 skips Swiffering because of friends, that\u2019s whatever, but if he skips bathroom cleaning he has to take on both parts of the cleaning the next day. Mirror + sink shouldn\u2019t take a lot of time to do, so it doesn\u2019t seem particularly mean to start having him do both if he\u2019s skipped his part one day.\n\nI think you should make it clear to 14 that he should be able to skip chores if he has equally important obligations, like if he is or starts doing things like sports/extracurriculars/a job that would take up a similar amount of the day to having friends over, he should also be excused from chores when he has those things keeping him too busy to clean.\n\n(Obviously 14 is a bit young for a \u201creal\u201d job in the states but if he\u2019s doing babysitting or yard work jobs on occasion that would be just as time consuming and important as having friends over)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Either it\u2019s necessary every single day or it isn\u2019t but it can\u2019t vary, you have to make a decision, YTA", "still unfair that you promote this \"good habit\" harder on a kid than the other. If it is okay for one to skip it one day, the other one also is going to be okay."]}
