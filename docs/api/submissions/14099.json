I also see why the 14-year-old gets frustrated (kids are so equity minded when it comes to their siblings getting out of chores!). Maybe it would be reasonable to say that they can do their chores after their friends leave. These chores do sound pretty quick, and I think if they need to have their friend leave 15 minutes early so they can do their chores, that's reasonable. (But you, as the parent, can also just say \"these are the rules, and I am sorry they frustrate you\" if you want!)", "NTA\n\nLook, I had\u2026issues with fairness between me and my sibling growing up. I\u2019m also autistic. So even as an adult I get pretty hung up on keeping things \u201cfair.\u201d But there\u2019s really nothing especially unfair about your ruling.\n\nYour post seems to imply the kids have separate bedrooms and each Swiffer their own. Unless 14 has to Swiffer 12\u2019s bedroom when 12\u2019s friends are over, or if 14 is doing bathroom chores multiple days in a row while 12 doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s really not a big deal.\n\nPerhaps you could compromise that if 12 skips Swiffering because of friends, that\u2019s whatever, but if he skips bathroom cleaning he has to take on both parts of the cleaning the next day. Mirror + sink shouldn\u2019t take a lot of time to do, so it doesn\u2019t seem particularly mean to start having him do both if he\u2019s skipped his part one day.\n\nI think you should make it clear to 14 that he should be able to skip chores if he has equally important obligations, like if he is or starts doing things like sports/extracurriculars/a job that would take up a similar amount of the day to having friends over, he should also be excused from chores when he has those things keeping him too busy to clean.\n\n(Obviously 14 is a bit young for a \u201creal\u201d job in the states but if he\u2019s doing babysitting or yard work jobs on occasion that would be just as time consuming and important as having friends over)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's a lot of socializing on school nights.", "You already ARE TA!  Why do you like the 12 yr old better than the 14 year old?  You dislike your older son and you\u2019re making it obvious to both sons. You need some kind of mental help, what you\u2019re doing is cruel.", "You are already the asshole. Might as well go all in.", "It's a good habit though. It's good for your lungs not to let dust accumulate. I do it every day in my room.", "I think it\u2019s overkill. 4-5 times a week is plenty and the fact that your kids can skip it when friends are over proves it isn\u2019t necessary. Either it\u2019s necessary every single day or it isn\u2019t but it can\u2019t vary, you have to make a decision, YTA", "still unfair that you promote this \"good habit\" harder on a kid than the other. If it is okay for one to skip it one day, the other one also is going to be okay.", "How could you possibly think you are not the ah? \n\nYTA\n\nSo much.\n\nMake it fair. If either of them have people over, then no chores. \n\nIntroverts deserve equality ffs", "Nta sounds like your 14yo is a 14yo. But why couldn\u2019t the chores be done once the friend leaves.", "I got swiffered once a long time ago. Never again", "YTA, give both a chore amnesty. Don\u2019t you think he feels awkward cleaning in front of younger kids?!", "YTA. Why doesn't he have to do the chores after he gets home or his friend leaves, whichever the case is? Your older son shouldn't be penalized for not being as social as his brother. Not only are you punishing your older son, but your telling your younger son he won't have to be responsible for his share of the household chores during his roommate years or when he gets married if he just stays away from home or has company in.", "YTA. The chores don\u2019t sound time consuming. What is preventing them from doing them the same day a friend comes over?", "YTA. My entire childhood, I'd have playdates at my best friend's house at least once a week, and she always had to do her chores while I was there, completely non-negotiable. I'd follow her around and we'd chat while she did them, sometimes I'd help out, sometimes I'd just watch TV or play with her toys while I waited. She never complained about it, and I never minded either.\n\ntl;dr; doing chores with his friends over will not kill him or his friends, can personally confirm.", "YTA when they are adults the chores will have to be done no matter what their social life looks life. Set that up now.", "YTA. Your elders probably feels resentment right now towards you and his younger brother. Chores are chores and they have to get done regardless. And wouldn\u2019t it make sense for those chores to be done before hanging out with friends anyway? Just because the 14 isn\u2019t as social doesn\u2019t give u an excuse to burden him with extra stuff to do. It\u2019s not fair and idk why it\u2019s a question you\u2019re even asking. If u favor one more than the other, just say it", "Yta.  Wouldn\u2019t it just be easier to say \u201cno friends over until chores are done?\u201d", "Yta - the kid with friends has to do the chores BEFORE or AFTER his friends are over.", "12yo me would purposely have people over all the time if I had these rules.\nNot fair to his brother at all.\nAlso, why shouldn't he do some chores when friends are over? Some chores take 5-10mins...\n\nYTA", "YTA. WTF is wrong with you?", "YTA. You're essentially punishing one of your sons for being more introverted than the other. Chores should be set and fair, not dependent on social calendars.", "YTA for essentially punishing your introverted child!\n\nI'm guessing you're an extrovert and just can't understand why your other child doesn't \"make friends \" as easily? Stop.  Just stop.  \n\nAnd is this a freaking reddit commercial for swiffer or what?", "YTA. I agree with the 14 year old, in my house growing up, friends couldn't come over and there were no outside activities until homework and chores were done. You're letting the 12 year old skip out on chores for leisure isn't fair to the 14 year old. I'm sure you didn't wanna do your siblings chores growing up so why are you doing that to your son?!", "I think the grounding is a bit much. I used to do my chores while my friends were over and frankly I had a lot more daily chores. My friends either helped or they would chat with me while I did my chores. It also seems pretty reasonable that 14yo is cranky about having to do his brother\u2019s chores because that would just be really annoying. What you\u2019ve described is 5-10 mins worth of chores, so it seems highly reasonable that 12yo could just do that quick like after his friend left.", "YTA, one child is clearly doing more than the other and all that\u2019s going to do is cause resentment between them, and I don\u2019t blame your older son for his actions to a situation that is clearly unfair. If it\u2019s ok for one to skip, then it should be ok for the other to skip so why don\u2019t you just make it that if the 12 year old has a friend over and isn\u2019t doing chores your 14 year old has the night off too, that way it\u2019s equal between them. If the garbage needs to be take out, the 14 year old does it the night the other has a friend over and then gets the following night off while the other picks up the slack. You\u2019re effectively punishing one son and rewarding the other, I\u2019d suggest that you come up with a workaround for this quickly because the longer it goes on the more of a problem it\u2019ll be", "YTA I can understand not having the kids doing chores while their friends are there, but they aren\u2019t they are 24/7. The more social kid can easily do his chores after his friends have gone home. You\u2019re just setting yourself up for disaster here with the situation and these vague rules.", "Of course YTA\n\nYou created an unfair environment where one child is punished for not having a lot of friends. And why can't your other kid do 10 minutes of chores after their friends leave? What kinda nonsense is that?", "You are very much YTA. My daughter was extremely social and involved in every club or sport she could wedge herself into. She has ADHD so keeping busy kept her out of too much trouble. So I was the mom who had to have a huge SUV because I worked for myself and had the time to ferry kids around to activities. I also have ADHD so am constantly on the move and am outdoorsy also can do an craft under the sun lol. So I guess I was fun mom so my house was grand central station because a lot of parents picked up their kids from my house starting in grade school. That being said, I was no one\u2019s maid, all the kids pitched in and helped if they were at my house because I was second mom to about 20 kids and we lived on a small farm a few miles outside of town so always something to do. If someone did not want to help they sat there and watched but that normally did not last long because the other kids did not put up with lol, plus cute farm animals for the win. You are playing favorites with your extroverted child being punished because he is not as social. You seem, in my opinion, too invested in your popular child and you are going to make your other one resent you. Take it from the child who was made to do all the chores m siblings would throw a fit over, I am NC with my family and that started when I was younger than your children. You coming across as a bullying dictator is not going to make your child no longer resent you. You are not teaching him responsibility you are teaching him that you will only give him a pass if he lives up to your social standards, if not he is punished. And do not try to say doing his chores is not a punishment. Yes it is if his sibling gets out of them simply because he had friends over. You are actually being very cruel and undermining his self worth and that is to your shame.", "Wow, so you hate that your 14 year old is not as social so you punish that behavior by sticking him with the chores, and then act surprised he got angry. Every time I think I've seen the worst parenting decision ever on AITA, another comes along.", "YTA.\n\nWhy do they need to swiffer their rooms and put their rubbish out daily? Why can't they do it when they need to? My teen does her bin when it's full. I sweep the lino floors when they need it (a couple of times a week). \n\nI feel like you are over doing it on the chore expectations and your 14yo absolutely gets to have a problem with it. \n\nChill out a bit.", "For crying out loud. If he has to pick up the brother's slack, then the brother should be made to do extra time when his friends aren't there. Definitely YTA and you are definitely showing favoritism. I'd be angry too!!!!!", "Without a doubt, YTA.  Your system sucks and you need to change it and not subsidize your 12 yo just because they are more social.", "I think it's totally fair to rephrase this whole thing as \"I punish my son for not having friends, AITA?\" because that's the story and all the information you need to make a ruling.  \n\n\nOf course you're YTA, how could you not be, it has nothing to do with being old, \"fair\" is timeless, and one of your kids gets punished either for something that already sucks for him or simply for being different from what you would like, and neither, by any measure, is fair.   \n\n\nIf he wants friends and struggles to make them, hey, now he's lonely and he has extra work while watching you reward his brother for what he wishes he had.  Fuckin' great!  A+.  \n\n\nOr, he doesn't want to be that social, he's comfortable on his own, with his thoughts, doing his own thing, and you're telling him you don't understand him, that he's bad for not being something other than what he is, and that you (obviously) prefer his brother.  That's... not better.  \n\n\nIt seems to me as though you're making no effort to understand your son.  You're certainly not talking to him.  You shared none of what he had to say when you asked him to break down his perspective for you, likely because you didn't ask him that.  You're not trying to hear him out, you're not even trying to reason him, and then when that leads to escalation because you're flat-out being disrespectful at this point, you punish him.   \n\n\nUnless you raised an asshole, your kid is probably not being an asshole.  He has a super valid point and of course he's growing angry as you continue to give him the short end of the stick and expecting him to like it.  You need to apologize, take action to change things, and do something really nice for the kid you've been kind of shitting on for who knows how long.  His labor and time have value, and he's seen what, years of that value being dismissed while his brother got more for doing less.    \n\n\nFucking lame.  Make it right.", "You need to chill on the chores, did you want slaves is that why you had kids? Speaking from experience of growing up with helicopter parents unless you\u2019re on a farm where chores are important forcing your kids to do the majority of the house work could very easily turn  them into a slob. You\u2019re creating a environment of dread that can manifest itself when they aren\u2019t under your control. Chores are important and kids do need to do them but unless you have people coming over frequently the inside of your house doesn\u2019t need to look like you\u2019re about to have a viewing.", "Since when the fuck does having having friends equal not doing chores?? When I have friends over *in the house I own* I still have to do my chores. Why can't he do the chores in the morning? Or after his friends leave?\n\nSeriously,  do you know how many goddamn times I had to clean the kitchen while my friends waited outside for me as a kid??

Are you doing your chores before you go, or leaving time when you get home?\"\n\nDon't punish the introvert for being an introvert.", "I what? \nThis chore list doesn't should like full day activity? \nWhy can't they do it before/after, or switch days with their sibling? You basically punishing him for not having friends? \n\nYTA. Jeez.", "INFO\n\nWhy isn't the rule \"if any friend is over, no child has to do chores\"? Based on your wording, that's what I originally thought the rule was because it makes a lot of sense to not have one kid cleaning all around the other kid plus a friend.\n\nYou've admitted that swiffering every day is unnecessary overkill, which is why they're allowed to skip when friends are over. Why don't 14 **and** 12 both skip chores regardless of who is hosting the friend? Why enforce the rules on only half of your kids just because one of them had a visitor? Why can't everybody have the day off?", "YTA - the 12yo can do their chores after the friend goes home.", "Agree. That was a must in my house along with homework being done", "Obvious who is the favourite child here.", "Or they can just do the chore while talking to their friend. A childhood friend who ended up becoming like family had chores every Sunday, and every time I was over on chore day I'd help. We'd listen to music, talk, and get through everything faster so we could get back to playing guitar hero or watching horror movies lol. Even as an adult I've helped friends with cooking, cleaning, and renovations while visiting. Hell, I spent a good hour today helping a neighbor with plant care and getting her record player working in between working on assignments for one of my classes! It's not impossible for the 12yo to multitask and OP needs to realize that.", "I agree with this as well - or, don't enforce daily cleaning? Maybe every other day?

I hope OP saw and remembers this comment", ">Which one of the two do you think suffers already from not having many friends? \n\nJust gonna say, my oldest didn't suffer from not having many friends.

Yuk.", "My daughter got in trouble for something a couple years ago and we made her pull weeds before she could be \u201coff the hook\u201d.
