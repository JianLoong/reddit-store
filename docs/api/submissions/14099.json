I also see why the 14-year-old gets frustrated (kids are so equity minded when it comes to their siblings getting out of chores!). Maybe it would be reasonable to say that they can do their chores after their friends leave. These chores do sound pretty quick, and I think if they need to have their friend leave 15 minutes early so they can do their chores, that's reasonable. (But you, as the parent, can also just say \"these are the rules, and I am sorry they frustrate you\" if you want!)", "NTA\n\nLook, I had\u2026issues with fairness between me and my sibling growing up. I\u2019m also autistic. So even as an adult I get pretty hung up on keeping things \u201cfair.\u201d But there\u2019s really nothing especially unfair about your ruling.\n\nYour post seems to imply the kids have separate bedrooms and each Swiffer their own. Unless 14 has to Swiffer 12\u2019s bedroom when 12\u2019s friends are over, or if 14 is doing bathroom chores multiple days in a row while 12 doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s really not a big deal.\n\nPerhaps you could compromise that if 12 skips Swiffering because of friends, that\u2019s whatever, but if he skips bathroom cleaning he has to take on both parts of the cleaning the next day. Mirror + sink shouldn\u2019t take a lot of time to do, so it doesn\u2019t seem particularly mean to start having him do both if he\u2019s skipped his part one day.\n\nI think you should make it clear to 14 that he should be able to skip chores if he has equally important obligations, like if he is or starts doing things like sports/extracurriculars/a job that would take up a similar amount of the day to having friends over, he should also be excused from chores when he has those things keeping him too busy to clean.\n\n(Obviously 14 is a bit young for a \u201creal\u201d job in the states but if he\u2019s doing babysitting or yard work jobs on occasion that would be just as time consuming and important as having friends over)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the garbage needs to be take out, the 14 year old does it the night the other has a friend over and then gets the following night off while the other picks up the slack.

My daughter was extremely social and involved in every club or sport she could wedge herself into. She has ADHD so keeping busy kept her out of too much trouble. So I was the mom who had to have a huge SUV because I worked for myself and had the time to ferry kids around to activities. I also have ADHD so am constantly on the move and am outdoorsy also can do an craft under the sun lol. So I guess I was fun mom so my house was grand central station because a lot of parents picked up their kids from my house starting in grade school. That being said, I was no one\u2019s maid, all the kids pitched in and helped if they were at my house because I was second mom to about 20 kids and we lived on a small farm a few miles outside of town so always something to do. If someone did not want to help they sat there and watched but that normally did not last long because the other kids did not put up with lol, plus cute farm animals for the win. You are playing favorites with your extroverted child being punished because he is not as social.

Take it from the child who was made to do all the chores m siblings would throw a fit over, I am NC with my family and that started when I was younger than your children. You coming across as a bullying dictator is not going to make your child no longer resent you. You are not teaching him responsibility you are teaching him that you will only give him a pass if he lives up to your social standards, if not he is punished.

You are actually being very cruel and undermining his self worth and that is to your shame.", "Wow, so you hate that your 14 year old is not as social so you punish that behavior by sticking him with the chores, and then act surprised he got angry.

Your system sucks and you need to change it and not subsidize your 12 yo just because they are more social.", "I think it's totally fair to rephrase this whole thing as \"I punish my son for not having friends, AITA?\" because that's the story and all the information you need to make a ruling.  \n\n\nOf course you're YTA, how could you not be, it has nothing to do with being old, \"fair\" is timeless, and one of your kids gets punished either for something that already sucks for him or simply for being different from what you would like, and neither, by any measure, is fair.   \n\n\nIf he wants friends and struggles to make them, hey, now he's lonely and he has extra work while watching you reward his brother for what he wishes he had.  Fuckin' great!  A+.  \n\n\nOr, he doesn't want to be that social, he's comfortable on his own, with his thoughts, doing his own thing, and you're telling him you don't understand him, that he's bad for not being something other than what he is, and that you (obviously) prefer his brother.  That's... not better.  \n\n\nIt seems to me as though you're making no effort to understand your son.  You're certainly not talking to him.  You shared none of what he had to say when you asked him to break down his perspective for you, likely because you didn't ask him that.  You're not trying to hear him out, you're not even trying to reason him, and then when that leads to escalation because you're flat-out being disrespectful at this point, you punish him.   \n\n\nUnless you raised an asshole, your kid is probably not being an asshole.  He has a super valid point and of course he's growing angry as you continue to give him the short end of the stick and expecting him to like it.  You need to apologize, take action to change things, and do something really nice for the kid you've been kind of shitting on for who knows how long.

They can choose to do them while they have guests, or postpone them until later.  \nSometimes we have the same children visiting weekly for several weeks in a row, and those children are asked to help set the table and clean up after.  \nI see it this way that it is healthy for children to learn to help out, and if you hang out somewhere so much that the person cooking knows what their favorite dishes are, then you can also help out! (No they don't get their own duties)  \nI have always been met with understanding from the children's parents, in fact they appreciate that I don't just let their children hang out without having to help. They would be asked the same thing at home and they can't use my home as a way to escape it.  \nI expect the same from my children, it is healthy for them to learn that things go better if we all help each other!  \nI understand your elder, I would also strike out if I was discriminated against like that just because I'm not as social as my brother.  \n**So you've grounded your son for protesting against discrimination, let it sink in!**", "YTA \n\nYou should make sure that both do the same amount of chores. \nSo either do not allow any excuses anymore for them to get out of chores or make it so that if one of them can't do chores today you assign extra chores to them for the next day. \n\nMaking one do more chores makes him feel punished for not inviting friends over/ being less social.", "As a kid who grew up having to clean every day there is nothing more bullshit than wiping already spotless baseboards.\n\nDon't waste their time.

They'd have chores on the weekends, and if we wanted to stay all weekend it meant we'd either keep them company during or help out with the chores. If the younger son is having long extended sleepovers he and the friends should learn that life still goes on, like the way you mentioned adults still help each other out with chores and home maintenance type projects.", "Daily swiffwring seems excessive to me. Dust doesn't build up that fast. Plus all those sheets on the Swiffer generate so much extra trash waste. I get vacuuming once a week. Anything more than that seems pointless. \n\nAs for the kids. Of course one is upset the other is constantly getting out of doing tasks. His older kid might be just socially burnt out from already spending 8h a day around others. That's ok.
