The problem came up recently when my stepson had to write about the worst thing that happened in his life and he put the divorce of his parents. My husband was concerned that despite being so young and after a decade, his son still feels that's the worst thing to happen to him. His daughter also feels the same way, as she told her dad when he was talking to her brother. My husband had this discussion while our kids were home and they heard my stepkids tell my husband that they wish he and their mom had not fallen out of love and had wanted to stay married. \n\nMy kids were upset hearing this and took it more personally than it was meant. Later that night they were upset and asked me why their siblings don't love our family and why they wouldn't want them. I asked where it was coming from and my older daughter told me what they heard and how them feeling like that means they don't love and want them.\n\nI told them it's not true, and I asked them to put themselves into their siblings shoes. I talked them through some of it in an age appropriate way (what if daddy and I were no longer together, how would you feel, they answered sad and I asked would they be happy we divorced if daddy remarried and they had siblings from him and a stepmom and they said no). I explained that that was how it is for their older siblings. They said it is kinda different since it's us and I told them it might feel that way for them, but it isn't the same for their older siblings. They asked me if I felt the same way about Grandma J and Grandpa B and I said yes, I said I didn't want them to be miserable together but that a part of me would always wish my parents had been a better couple together.\n\nI checked in with my kids the next day and they were doing better. My stepkids thanked me for understanding and for explaining it to them because they would have hurt their feelings if they'd had to attempted to explain that stuff to them. I told them to never be ashamed of their feelings and that they're normal and being kids of divorce is something not everyone fully understands.\n\nMy kids ended up talking to my ILs about what we discussed and their siblings and they blew a fuse and said the conversation was inappropriate for such young kids.

I think it's really sweet the divorce was the worst thing that happened to them- HEAR ME OUT REDDIT- it was 10 years ago. That means they got through puberty and a big chunk of their teen years without another major trauma. And they aren't citing incidents they witnessed leading up to the divorce, or any other leading cause of childhood trauma. \n\nI'm not minimizing the pain of the divorce, but it is a pain most families know in one way or another, and that's their absolute worst. \n\nI kinda take that as a sign that they've had pretty good lives since the divorce. They could have said you n dad getting married was the worst. Or when the siblings came along bc that's when they knew there was no chance of reconciliation.\n\nBut they aren't resentful of those things... they just pine for a life not lived.

I absolutely applaud you OP for taking the time to explain these BIG feelings to your kids in a way that they can understand and not just leaving them feeling bad or feeling unloved, sounds like your stepkids really appreciated it and appreciated your understanding.

Speaking to your children like they are human beings and validating their feelings by helping them work through them with explanations and introducing multiple viewpoints is EXACTLY what you are supposed to do. They may still need some more conversations or time to process what that means. And they may not be able to fully understand at this time. But the fact that you introduced the concept of how these feelings work and what they mean will make it easier for them to accept when things do click for them. \n\nAnd also, it is important to remind your husband that just because something is the 'worst thing to every happen to them,\" that doesn't mean they are still devastated or traumatized by it. Everybody's \"worst thing\" is subjective and relative. And that thing will always be the \"worst thing\" until something they feel is even worse than that happens to them.

They are allowed to always feel sad that their parents got divorced and it's okay that it is the worst thing that has ever happened to them (especially when you consider the world we live in today and what terrible things kids can go through). But are they still able to happy with what they have now? Are they able to appreciate that both their parents love them and that they have and extended family to care for them? Because that's what is important. And they can still feel that way now and still feel like the divorce is the \"worst thing to ever happen to them.\" Anyone can heal from their worst experience but it will still be their worst experience.

These are difficult but common concepts and the world is full of them.

Major kudos from a fellow mum.", "My husband's parents divorced when he was 4 and it was extremely difficult for him to come to terms with his own divorce from his ex as he didn't want his children to go through what he went through (the oldest was 4 at the time too and my husband often says \"he broke him\" because of the divorce (which is ludicrous but it's the way his trauma manifests) because he says the kid used to be so innocent and is now a little more serious (I mean, he's 11 ffs, of course he's not a happy go lucky 4 year old anymore)). \n\nMy parents separated when I was 2, I have no memory of them being together and I only saw my dad every second weekend growing up so I was basically raised by a single mom. My perspective about relationships is so different from my husband's it's almost fascinating. I believe that when two people are separating, it's often because they were incompatible in the first place and it's best for them to separate, especially so that the children don't grow up in a household where the parents are hostile to each other. Why would you want to let your children grow up in an environment where the only example of a couple they have is that of two people who are miserable with each other? I keep telling my husband that the kids now get to grow up with two parents who actually like each other in a co-parenting/friendly way and can have positive interactions with each other rather than seeing them yell at each other and obviously dislike one another. Now they get to see their dad in a fulfilling relationship where both partners are happy and committed to one another and if their mom re-marries, I expect them to have another model of a healthy relationship. \n\nKids of divorced parents often miss the idea of what could have been if their parents truly belonged together. But most people don't find their absolute perfect match the first time around. People change throughout their lives and sometimes, what you liked in a partner changes over time and compatibility is no longer there. I'm not saying one shouldn't try to make things work but if neither partner can look passed the changes/evolution of their spouse, sometimes its best for everyone to just move on.", "As someone who is also a child of divorce but it was deeply traumatic, you are an incredible stepmom and mom to your bio kids. \n\nYou, your husband, and his ex wife have been able to raise these teenagers into healthy, mature, and well-adjusted young adults. By the time I was 16 I was suicidal from bullying, had undiagnosed anorexia, severe anxiety due to my parents, and have a large list of hang ups and triggers I\u2019ll never get through regardless of therapy. The fact that the divorce and lack of one home is their big trauma is amazing and speaks to how mentally healthy they likely are. \n\nI envy the love your blended family have because it is pure and good, and I hope your little kids can grow up experiencing zero trauma in life since your steps have been able to live a good life.

They might be \"coping\" just fine and still not be happy about their parents' divorce. It's perfectly acceptable for them to not be happy about it ever in their lives.

I cried my eyes out when we got home, because I didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d grown to feel like a performative little afterthought that my parents could dress up and parade around to get to feel good about themselves. I understand that no parent means that, but so often the child\u2019s perception of divorce/separation are ignored altogether, as though we don\u2019t have eyes or ears. Thanks for not doing that.\n\nWhat you did here was kind to both your stepchildren and bio children. I wish that someone had given me the tools to cope with what I went through. You\u2019ve done something important to prevent your children from misunderstanding the situation.", "  I think that you handled it extremely well, and the way you explained it was very age appropriate!! Good for you.\n\n  The IL's are part of a generation who rug swept and did not discuss things like this. IMO, this is why a lot of kids back then *blamed themselves* for things; no one ever talked about \"bad\" things like divorce, let alone something like suicide or abuse!!\n\n   Your IL's may never grasp it, but you helped all of the kids understand something that is seldom explained (this well) to them.", "You\u2019re honestly amazing for being objective and putting your kids first! Kids can handle more than we give them credit for!", "NTA what amazing way to explain this complicated matter to your children. Also good job on being supportive and understanding of your step kids.", "Your ILs are out of line and need to be told they can STFU about your parenting decisions.  NTA.", "NTA. You did a great job explaining it the way they could understand. They asked you questions, and you didn't push them aside. All of this is important to them, and it also made the older kids feel ok about their feelings. I think that means your doing a helluva good job!!!! Tell the ILs to butt out and leave the parenting to you!", "NTA it was not a conversation that was to adult for little kids - they had emotions about what they hear = not to young to be explained things in an age appropriate way. Which I think you did beautifully btw.\n\nI honestly think it would have been worse if you tried to sugarcoat it or push their feels aside.", "NTA This was completely kid appropriate. You explained that it's hard to see your parents divorce and that their siblings are still sad that they can't live with both their parents, but it doesn't mean that they don't love their younger siblings.\n\nDo your in-laws think that their grandkids, who have half-sinlings and have probably met their dad's ex-wife, don't know what divorce is?", "NTA. You handled that in an empathic, compassionate way that helped all your kids. Divorce is hard for kids, even in the best possible circumstances. No one is helped by hiding things from children or punishing kids for expressing their feelings. You did a great job.", "NTA. You have answers and information to children struggling with a situation. It\u2019s never gonna be ideal.\n\nIn fact, I\u2019m kind of annoyed with others judging your quick response. You had boots on the ground. You made a call. Everything else is just noise.", "YTA here. You need professional help and learn to close the door if you are going to have serious talks to the two oldest kids.", "Yup.  My parent is like the ILs, in the sense of never telling children what's going on, in any way, let alone an age appropriate way.  It leaves kids with so much uncertainty, and feeling like they are bad/wrong/something is wrong with them.  I spent SO much of my childhood feeling like I was on shaky ground, and questioning EVERYTHING because I never knew what was going on, and never had anyone to talk through things with.  OP absolutely did the right things.  Helping your kids work out their feelings, in an age appropriate way is always the right answer. \n\nAlso, most kids are WAY smarter, and intuitive than people give them credit for, and they already know something is up", "This is an absolutely fantastic point. My parents divorced when I was 10 and it was tough. But the abuse from my father and stepmother was way worse. If I had to pick a \"worst thing\" in my life, it'd probably be them keeping my half brothers away from me and not allowing me to even send gifts, which started when I was 17. The divorce was the most traumatic thing for me for a few years. Then, it wasn't because things can get *so much worse*.", "...Can I also just add, being assigned by a teacher to write about the \"worst thing\" that's ever happened to you seems like a recipe for trouble? I'm not a parent or a teacher so maybe I'm off base here, but it just seems like a bad idea.", "This stood out to me too: if divorce is the worst thing that's happened to you in 16 years, you're living a pretty nice life! Not to minimize the trauma of divorce, but I'm also a child of divorce and it's nothing compared to *all the other trauma*. I was *happy* my parents got divorced because, in theory, it meant some of the causes of my trauma might lessen or disappear. The amount of trauma my friends and I had collected by 16... Woof. These kids are being led well.", "Seriously. I would be very concerned if, at 15 & 16, that *isn't* the worse thing that has happened to them.\n\nOP, you did a great job explaining that to them, and I'm pretty sure it's accomplished the *opposite* of what your ILs say it did. NTA and good job being understanding of all the kid's feelings.", "Right! My parents divorce was the best thing that happened to me because the abuse finally stopped.\n\nNTA", "My first thought was how lucky they are that the divorce was the worst thing that happened to them.", "It was school related. Not something we ever expected to come up in a school setting and I can only imagine how awful it could be for some kids to have to face.", "Your in-laws are way out of bounds. Talking about feelings, even complicated ones, with children is best done before they fester and turn into something else. Your earnest, age-appropriate, sensitive and sensible discussion with all four probably defused a future time bomb. Congratulations - you are a great (step)mom. I wish your blended family all the best. NTA.", "My parents seperated when I was 6. The seperation itself wasn't that traumatic but when my step-dad moved in, it was horrible time for me. I would still consider it the worst time in my life. He is a wonderful person, now, 16-17 years, later I view him also as my father, eventho my bio dad is in the picture (more or less).\n\n\nMy latest scare was that mom and step-dad were having issues and my mother mentioned that she was considering a divorce. I was panicking hard inside because I defentely did not want that. He is my family now! I love him, I would be absolutely traumatized if they divorced now. Even though I am an adult and haven't lived with them for 5+ years, my only thought was that 'please no, I don't want to go through that again. I don't want my sister to go through that'. I'm 25 yo. So it's a very valid comment that it's traumatic in any age. But seems that they managed to solve their issues, atleast for now. So it's good. \n\n\nI think you explained it in a wonderful way to your children and you are absolutely amazing person. I wish you the very best in life.", "It sucks to say but I'm 100% with you.

They divorced when I was 9 and I was so glad (but felt a little guilty for feeling that way too, RIP).", "Ooh same. A teacher in my childhood referred to our situation as a \"broken home\" and I was pissed. I told her I felt like my home was fixed. She told little fifth grade me that I was too small to understand what I was talking about", "I remember the whole fam horrified with my genuine happiness, I had to remind them I had insomnia (yay for undiagnosed anxiety since a very young age!) and had to endure years of them fighting at night.\n\n\nI was only 11 and no adults in my family had the tools or emotional maturity to face me/help me through things after I explained myself to them.", "Oh jeez, I totally glazed over that this was an assignment- unless it was part of therapy- yikes", "Oh look, another reddit stranger I now wanna hug \ud83d\udda4", "Tell me about it, divorce was actually illegal in my country when my parents split, so legally they were married for about 10 years after the separation.\n\nIn my day it was considered a huge embarrassment for the whole family if a married couple split, I actually didn't get it too bad from other kids but adults treated my siblings and I very differently \"parent/teacher night is coming up but you don't really have proper parents so we need to decide what to do\" thanks teach, I'm 7.", "[removed]", "I don't see that as a need, frankly. I'll compare it to a common grief: I lost my father. My daughter asked me why it still can hurt me that my dad died. And I explained, 'It doesn't hurt in the way you think it does. Sometimes I just wish he was here. But, I'm not still grieving him, if that makes sense? I won't ever get over it. He was part of me. But, I have grown used to it. It doesn't keep me from living my life. I don't feel stuck in the place where I was when my dad died, honey. You see something that's not there for me.\"\n\nNo point in seeing what these kids have not expressed. They lament a loss. Some losses you adjust to. You have to. But, you will still feel the loss at times. These kids responded to a theme for a paper at school. It wasn't an organic, spontaneous, or overwhelming thing that kick started this. A school assignment was where this all began?", "It doesn't seem like the step kids are harping on this? It was brought up by a school project. It could be that they're very well adjusted kids who just haven't had anything earth shattering happen to them besides their parents divorce. OP didn't mention any negative coping behaviors or the children still being consumed with thoughts about the divorce.", "How are they not coping well? Just because they still identify this event as the worst thing to happen to them doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not coping. It just means nothin else that bad has happened", "What?", "When you get a response that has basically no connection to your comment, it's likely a bot. \n\nI imagine you'll find that same sentence contained in an older comment lower down the thread, in a place where it makes sense as a reply.", "It sounds like they have great coping skills.

All those kids are lucky to have you. \n\nLet me know if you're looking to adopt someone who is surely old enough to be your own mom. ;)", "I'm sorry, what? You are NTA. This was a perfect and incredibly enlightened conversation and point of view. I'm sure it moved mountains for your step children's respect and opinion of you. Not to say it wasn't already good but I know it moved them to have you understand their feelings on the situation and be able to explain it to the smaller kids in a gentle and meaningful way they would understand.

You taught them that as relationships change, people will have valid and complicated feelings about those changes.\n\n>I told them to never be ashamed of their feelings and that they're normal and being kids of divorce is something not everyone fully understands.\n\nYou did a good job of parenting a difficult moment.", "NTA.\n\nYour step kids have every right to feel sad over the split between their parents (which may have caused a lot of pain to all of the involved).\n\nYour children are young, and I can understand them taking this way more personal than they need to simply because they still cannot understand what their older siblings went through.\n\nYou had exactly the right amount of personal experience and empathy to understand where everyone was coming from and try and make your younger ones not take it as a personal rejection, but simply a fact that had nothing to do with them. That it is ok to have complex feelings over such a delicate situation.\n\nThe only AH I could make here are the ILs but even that case is debatable. It is serious talk, yeah, but it is one that the kids NEED to have in order to not internalize exactly the message they were complaining about: that change sometimes can be painful but still lead to a newer situation with new people to love.

My 19-year old daughter still considers being the product of \"divorced parents\" her identity and constantly throws it around for sympathy even 11 years later. It has gotten her lots of leeway at school over the years and she has learned to use it to her advantage in many situations. It is infuriating and hurtful, particularly coming from a very ugly, nasty divorce as a child myself where there was often so much insecurity. So just be aware that though what was said may be hurtful and not \"ring true\" based on the actual situation, some kids actually embrace that identity. It gets them attention and sympathy. Don't take it too personally, but also look out for the signs that as the years go by, they are still using this identity to somehow gain sympathy and advantages.

They told you they appreciate it!\n\nThey sound like really great kids who are going to grow to be fine young adults in a few years.\n\nYou're guys are doing the blended family thing right.  Keep doing what's right for all of your children.\n\n\n\nEdit:  Oh, and I don't think the assignment from the teacher is really appropriate.  If at 15/16 I'd been asked to write about the \"worst thing that ever happened to me\" uh...no.  No.  No no no no *no no.*  I didn't really properly process and really begin to heal from *that* until I was well into my 20s.  I was only just starting to realize how damaging it had actually been long-term at 15 (when I had my first \"serious\" boyfriend, a good kid), and it broke me.  Being asked to write about that for a teacher to look at would not have done me *any* favors at that time.  And I was the kid who couldn't commit a falsehood to paper.  I'd have just not done the assignment.  And cried a lot.  At a minimum.  It would not have been good.  Some of their classmates are likely to be in a world of hurt over this assignment.  It's really not a simple trivia-about-your-life question.  Your kids are in good hands, but I worry about some of the other kids in your older son's class.", "NTA. Kids are a lot more intelligent and understanding than people take them for and you explained it perfectly to them. Props to you, you sound like a fantastic mom.", "NTA\n\nExcellent job. You did what was best for all the kids. I'm guessing your inlaws also are not children of divorce. As an adult child of divorce with close stepfamily, I think your process was awesome and appropriate. But most of all those not the parents of your kids people need to shut their traps about how you parent.", "NTA. Never too young to learn compassion. You sound awesome", "NTA you handled this very well and your ILs are exagerating", "They discuss issues like that on Sesame Street and Mister Rogers. If Fred Rogers can tackle segregation, and Big Bird can accept the death of Mr Hooper, you can teach your kids about empathy and divorce.\n\nEdit* NTA", "NTA.\n\nWholesome and great bonus parenting job!", "NTA that was a great way to deal with it. Good job momma's", "NTA. Considering the older siblings were about the same age when their parents divorced, of course the younger kids are old enough to hear about it and understand.", "NTA. Tell them to mind their business", "> And honestly... I think it's really sweet the divorce was the worst thing that happened to them- HEAR ME OUT REDDIT- it was 10 years ago. That means they got through puberty and a big chunk of their teen years without another major trauma. And they aren't citing incidents they witnessed leading up to the divorce, or any other leading cause of childhood trauma.\n\nThis is 100% what I was thinking. It is obviously never a *nice* thing to hear, but if that is the worst thing to happen to one's kids then I would consider myself both lucky and proud of protecting them from the sucky things that happen to so many others.", "I also think that if a child is old enough to ask about something, the deserve an answer.

A lie? \n\nIt may not have been ideal timing but it came up and giving an age appropriate explanation of what happened is better than ignoring it. And it seems like the younger kids understood and the older kids appreciated it.", "NTA\n\nThe kids raise the question or the issue. The options are let them stew and feel awful or develop a complex about it, or talk to them, help them understand and feel better about things. \n\nEveryone in your family, husband, stepkids and kids felt better. That's great! \n\nOther people can raise their kids how they want, you choose how you raise yours.", "Also it sounds like this was some kind of assignment? It's hard to come up with viable answers for stupid assignments like that. This is a perfectly reasonable thing to do a speech or write a paper or some other school crap for", "And frankly that's the only thing teachers should truly be expecting from assignments like this. I'm sure there's a lot of stuff that can pop up but I'd bet most teachers are expecting Divorce, Grandparent died, or Pet died as common answers", "Honestly seems weird to ask kids to trauma dump at that age. Especially if peers have access to what was written about.\n\nImagine if something truly horrendous happened and your English teacher was the first adult to know about it along with a class of peers because there were no better outlets? \n\nLike, that assignment should graded by a counselor, not a teacher.", "What else should have happened to a 16 year old that would eclipse their family splintering apart? I can only think of the death of a very close friend or family member, or a severe injury like losing a limb.\n\nYour husband clearly doesn't understand how much even the most amicable divorce affects the children involved.

There are much worse things(death, accidents, bullying, etc) that could be their worst trauma.   \nI rather think this is a horrible assignment as many kids would not want to share their worst trauma(abuse by parents etc).  \n\nIt is natural that the kids would wish their parents stayed together, but you seem to be blessed that they don't hate your marriage/kids.  And that they care about their younger sibs feelings <<*thanked me for understanding and for explaining it to them because they would have hurt their feelings if they'd had to attempted to explain that stuff to them*\\>>\n\nIgnore the In-laws.

In the 20 years since my parents split, of course more terrible and traumatic things have happened in my life. The divorce, though, somehow still feels like the most painful. For 15 year old me, green in the ways of the world, it WAS the worst thing and I still feel pain from it from time to time. In the years since, I\u2019ve faced some really difficult stuff\u2014sexual assault, death of close loved ones, toxic friendships, a cancer diagnosis. But I\u2019ve also grown and developed tools and coping mechanisms to deal with the trauma. As children, we don\u2019t have those tools. If I had to identify the most traumatic event of my life, my parents\u2019 divorce would still be towards the top of the list. It\u2019s hard for kids to deal, and I empathize with OP\u2019s step kids. There\u2019s clearly so much love in that family, though. And open, honest communication is so important. Pain and trauma are things we\u2019re all going to face in life but OP\u2019s family is working through it, together.\n\nThank you, OP and everyone in this thread, for being so real. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA I\u2019m a stepmom too as well as a child of divorce. I think you handled it perfectly!", "NTA. Your children are old enough to start to have tough conversations. Life is complicated, and kids even at a young age pick up on that. You showed great respect to your children in being honest with them the situation and teaching them empathy. You sound like such a wonderful person and parent.", "NTA: You handled it well. How you handled it, you not only helped the family understand each other and prevented resentment, but also helped teach empathy.", "NTA \n\nWhat a superb job you did.", "NTA", "NTA. You handled this well. Your kids didn't understand what their siblings were going through and how this assignment brought that up and you explained.

Honestly if YOU and your HUSBAND are okay with how it's been handled, that's what matters. At the end of the day, you did your best to make it make sense for your children while still allowing your step kids the freedom to share how they feel. You're showing all your kids that it's okay to express their feelings and to talk through the difficult feelings/emotions instead of fighting or suppressing them.", "NTA Why do they think they get a vote?

They're mandated reporters. But yea I'd hope they aren't a public report or anything", "NTA.  I think you handled the situation extremely well.  I was a teacher and I know many blended families face similar situations.  I'm not sure what your ILs would rather you had done.  Leave your kids hanging, thinking their step siblings don't love them?  That wouldn't have helped anyone.  Tell your step kids they have no right to their feelings?  That wouldn't have helped anyone, either.  Now your step kids know you understand their feelings and that those feelings are perfectly valid.  Your kids know their step siblings love them but still miss the way things were.  Look at it this way.  What if your family moves?  Your kids might like the new house, but still miss their old home.  Everyone feels that way sometimes.  ILs just need to stay out of it.", "NTA \u2026 kids can understand hard discussions and most of the time we don\u2019t give them enough credit. \n\nYou handled this with grace and compassion for all your children.

Divorce is a traumatic experience for children. Saying other events are more serious is disrespectful.", "I came close to tears reading your wonderfully thoughtful and poignant post. Beautifully worded.", "I have clear childhood memories of being between the ages of 7 and 10 and begging my parents to get a divorce already, since they obviously didn't like each other and give us all some peace.  I took my younger sibling for a lot of walks, so they have very different memories.  They kept fighting after that, but worked opposite shifts, so it was less obvious.  In retrospect, I can see there was so much trauma and lack of access to mental health care, but divorce doesn't always seem so bad. Sometimes it's the time before or the step parents after that are much worse.", "My child had to do assignments like this in social skills classes. It was more like \"what was a difficult time in your life, and what coping skills or strategies did you use to get through it?\" Then they would work through how they could use different coping strategies or talk through how they helped and could be applied to different situations that were difficult. But, this was a class for students with behaviour issues.", "NTA\n\nNot the stupid ILs, what you did is something we rarely see. Most ppl are too self-centered to put themselves in others' shoes before taking offence where no offence was meant. And by doing so you've saved hurt and pain for both your kids and step-kids.

Maybe you and DH need to discuss this with your ILs---including their discussing it with your kids. But the kids told us! Nonetheless, they're adults and they could have calmly heard the kids out and then had a quiet discussion with you and DH. No blowups necessary.

There is no better way to create a taboo or a problem than sweeping a child's concern under the rug.", "Veteran teacher here. The best way to help kids through complicated situations is to talk to them about it in an age appropriate way. Not sugar coat over your or their own feelings to preserve the happy image adults want. Your in laws want a happy cardboard cutout. On the other hand, you are giving your kids the tools to cope with the reality of an emotionally complicated existence. NTA."]}
