My husband has two older children who are 15 and 16. My husband and his ex-wife divorced 10 years ago and we met 9 years ago and married 8 years ago. My stepkids have had some complicated feelings about their parents divorce, understandably, and as a child of divorce myself, I understand them totally. The problem came up recently when my stepson had to write about the worst thing that happened in his life and he put the divorce of his parents. My husband was concerned that despite being so young and after a decade, his son still feels that's the worst thing to happen to him. His daughter also feels the same way, as she told her dad when he was talking to her brother. My husband had this discussion while our kids were home and they heard my stepkids tell my husband that they wish he and their mom had not fallen out of love and had wanted to stay married. \n\nMy kids were upset hearing this and took it more personally than it was meant. Later that night they were upset and asked me why their siblings don't love our family and why they wouldn't want them. I asked where it was coming from and my older daughter told me what they heard and how them feeling like that means they don't love and want them.\n\nI told them it's not true, and I asked them to put themselves into their siblings shoes. I talked them through some of it in an age appropriate way (what if daddy and I were no longer together, how would you feel, they answered sad and I asked would they be happy we divorced if daddy remarried and they had siblings from him and a stepmom and they said no). I explained that that was how it is for their older siblings. They said it is kinda different since it's us and I told them it might feel that way for them, but it isn't the same for their older siblings. They asked me if I felt the same way about Grandma J and Grandpa B and I said yes, I said I didn't want them to be miserable together but that a part of me would always wish my parents had been a better couple together.\n\nI checked in with my kids the next day and they were doing better. My stepkids thanked me for understanding and for explaining it to them because they would have hurt their feelings if they'd had to attempted to explain that stuff to them. I told them to never be ashamed of their feelings and that they're normal and being kids of divorce is something not everyone fully understands.\n\nMy kids ended up talking to my ILs about what we discussed and their siblings and they blew a fuse and said the conversation was inappropriate for such young kids. My husband told them they were exaggerating. But they said I had a much too grown up talk with them and that I made them think it's okay to not accept change and to think parents owe it to their kids to stay together for the kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671015214, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlnypf/aita_for_having_my_kids_put_themselves_in_my/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the kids are old enough to be part of a blended family their old enough for discussions about the blending.\n\nAnd honestly... I think it's really sweet the divorce was the worst thing that happened to them- HEAR ME OUT REDDIT- it was 10 years ago. That means they got through puberty and a big chunk of their teen years without another major trauma. And they aren't citing incidents they witnessed leading up to the divorce, or any other leading cause of childhood trauma. \n\nI'm not minimizing the pain of the divorce, but it is a pain most families know in one way or another, and that's their absolute worst. \n\nI kinda take that as a sign that they've had pretty good lives since the divorce. They could have said you n dad getting married was the worst. Or when the siblings came along bc that's when they knew there was no chance of reconciliation.\n\nBut they aren't resentful of those things... they just pine for a life not lived. We all have those forks in the road of our lives that we wonder how the other path would have played out. \n\nYou're doing great. Maybe the best I've read on here", "NTA.

Screw what your IL think", "NTA-You made this a teaching moment about the importance of empathy and compassion for others. Your in-laws are wrong on multiple levels.", "So NTA. You all handled an extremely difficult situation with care for each other. Being a child of divorced parents and having married z divorcee with 2 kids from a 1st marriage, I understand.\nI think that your step kids felt comfortable enough with you all to be open about their feelings is the most healthy way to be. It sounds like they are coming to terms with reconciling what they want with what life has provided; a hard but valuable life lesson.\nYou are absolutely correct to discuss it with the younger kids. They need to understand that it's not a rejection, it's a mourning for something lost. No kid is ever the same once their parents divorce (however broken the marriage).\nGood luck to you all.", "NTA\n\nKids of divorce have complicated feelings about their parents and often times, the new spouse can feel awful about it, rather than being understanding.

You and your husband are the ones who live with this every day so it's extremely unhelpful when other relatives interfere.", "NTA. NTA.NTA.NTA\n\nCommunicating with your kids is soo important. They had a concern. You addressed it in an appropriate way. Your children aren't going to come to their own conclusions or worse, sit with their fear. \n\n-You did an awesome job.-\n\nYour ILs seem like they don't respect that children are just tiny humans with all of their own thoughts and feelings but with none of the knowledge of how those things work.", "NAH\n\nY\u2019all handled it well. Your husband talked to his kids about their feelings instead of being mad that they were still upset about the divorce. You being a child of divorce was able to understand them not take offense to their feelings and was able to talk to your own kids about their feelings. The ILS are being ridiculous. Your kids were upset about what they heard from their older siblings and you talk to them the best way you could the way they could understand and resolved the issue.", "Inlaws are the assholes. They need to mind thier own business.", "NTA\n\nYou helped your kids understand how the older siblings felt.  That was a very positive thing to do.  Right now, they're too young to understand **WHY** parents divorce, that there may be serious issues such as cheating, or other things that make divorce necessary.\n\nI assume, when they are older, maybe when they start dating, you will explain why parents sometimes divorce.  But right now they literally wouldn't understand because they have no similar experience to relate it to, such as breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend.\n\nYou're doing very well by all of your kids here.", "NTA\n\nI think you handled it beautifully. The alternative was to, what, tell your kids that your stepkids were being awful and shouldn\u2019t feel that way? That\u2019s neither a) okay to say nor b) true.\n\nI see your stepchildren choosing that as the worst thing they\u2019ve experienced as a positive - they haven\u2019t had worse happen in their lives. They don\u2019t see their dad\u2019s remarriage as the worst thing that happened, or the expansion of their family. They haven\u2019t listed another traumatic event.

When a child asks a serious question, he/she is entitled to a serious answer. You made is very clear and non judgemental and explained them exactly what they needed to know. I don't think I would have been able to be so clear myself. Well done a'd continue the good job.", "Sound like you folks have the whole co-parenting/ step parenting issue well figured out.

I loved the way you dealt with the situation. It was a fantastic explanation and probably meant more to your bonus kids than they could express in words.

They can be happy their mum and dad are happy now, and still regret that they couldn\u2019t be happy together. You can be a happy blended family and accept that the happiness will always have a edge of regret that its not as simple and straightforward as you thought life was going to be.
