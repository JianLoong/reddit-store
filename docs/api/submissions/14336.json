We generally get along well and share household responsibilities. We also share groceries and occasionally treat ourselves to some desserts or snacks.\n\nLast week, I bought a small cake for us to share. We each had a slice, and there was one piece left. I mentioned that I wanted to save the last piece for a treat after work the following day. My sister agreed and I didn't think much of it.\n\nThe next day, I came home from work looking forward to enjoying the last slice of cake. When I opened the fridge, I discovered that the cake was gone. My sister admitted that she had eaten it, even though she knew I had called dibs on it. She said she had a moment of weakness and thought it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nI got upset and accused her of being selfish and inconsiderate for eating the piece I had been looking forward to all day. She felt guilty and apologized, but I was still really hurt by her actions.\n\nMy sister offered to buy another cake or any other dessert of my choice to make it up to me, but I told her it's not about the cake itself. It's about her not respecting my wishes and taking something that I had clearly claimed.\n\nThis incident has made me reconsider living with my sister. I feel like our relationship is strained, and I'm thinking about moving out to have my own space and avoid any further conflicts. However, I'm aware that my sister can't afford the rent on her own, and if I move out, she'll likely have to move back in with our parents.\n\nMy sister thinks I'm overreacting about a small issue and that it's just a piece of cake. She has already apologized and offered to replace it, but I still feel hurt and disrespected.\n\nSo, AITA for considering moving out because my sister ate the last piece of cake I had been saving for myself, knowing she can't afford the rent on her own?", "created_utc": 1681004952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g58ob/aita_for_threatening_to_move_out_after_my_sister/", "score": 2088, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, sometimes there will be miscommunication, or annoyances, or eating your food, or any number of conflicts.

Yeah, I ask my kids to go 50/50 when they have special items like cake/ice cream, etc. and be mindful of each others favorite items so that the person who only eats xyz isn\u2019t left with abc. This would have fallen into, (after the offer), \u201cyeah that sounds good, tell me about your day.\u201d\n\nMy sister once blew up at me over lunch because everyone was covering for my brothers gf who left her card at home and she refused. (As adults, my brother should have covered his gf so they can keep a private tally- this was before venmo and PayPal.) and my sister instead of saying, oh that\u2019s outside of my budget or hey brother, can you get it? She yelled at me (idk why) and said \u201cI refuse to pay for more than what I ordered!!\u201d (I was making my own money at the time while in school and she was on student loans with no job. So I think she felt strained, which I get.) but it definitely led to tension and her moving out shortly after because I didn\u2019t like the rigidity of her statement. Realizing now, she moved in with her bf who was cheating on her and they got married and divorced then she my grandparents and I ended up meeting my abuser- it was really a destabilizing situation!! \n\nShe and I are close now. But it took years to build it back up. Whenever possible, mend bridges with your siblings. I would have loved for us to stay close and keep an eye out for each other. Communication takes a lot of self introspection. \n\nIf you\u2019re looking to mend fences, using a gentle voice, ask if she\u2019d like to talk, sit face to face in a comfortable spot- like a couch or something and say you\u2019re sorry that you blew up, in the moment you felt (betrayed/disrespected/hurt/frustrated/whatever) because it felt like (she felt more important than you/there\u2019s a pattern of situations where xyz will happen, etc) then say can you see where I\u2019m coming from or what\u2019s your perspective on this? (That tells your sister that you realize that you blew up and that you want to repair the situation and value her) then you can end it with, (if you\u2019re comfortable) I know you\u2019re in a different financial situation than me, do you want to budget/look for opportunities together so that if we ever do need to move apart to save our relationship then you can do that and stay independent?\n\nMy parents are disastrous with money, so I had to learn about money on my own. I\u2019m grateful to have a nice home with my partner, a job with benefits, and everything I NEED, but when I was in my early 20s, I was not in that place. I was working 2-3 jobs and gigs. I usually went for one job that had a stable schedule and one job that had a flexible schedule so I could work around the full time job without bargaining with 2 bosses. (Oh, I have to do x at my part time gig that day\u2026) and I also worked at places that gave me what I needed at those times- so a furniture company when I had an empty house- huge discount and damaged stuff was often free (I never asked, but the owners gave it to me generously.) I also redo furniture, so I\u2019d get free stuff on Craigslist or Facebook in \u201cbuy nothing\u201d groups. I also worked in restaurants which usually provide an amazing tasting shift meal, free drink plus a discount. \n\nAs a hot mom with a sales background, I worked in promoting liquor brands for $30-75/hr which helped me stay home with my kids during the day and go to work at night to save on daycare. The companies- talent tree, geometry global,  you can also find ones on Facebook groups for promotional models in your area\u2026 (I now have a full time job bc I went back to school to get my masters but maybe these short term tips will help!!)\n\nEdit- removed one name.", "My younger brother used to regularly eat my portions of whatever food we would get, especially take out.
