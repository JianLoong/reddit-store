We generally get along well and share household responsibilities. We also share groceries and occasionally treat ourselves to some desserts or snacks.\n\nLast week, I bought a small cake for us to share. We each had a slice, and there was one piece left. I mentioned that I wanted to save the last piece for a treat after work the following day. My sister agreed and I didn't think much of it.\n\nThe next day, I came home from work looking forward to enjoying the last slice of cake. When I opened the fridge, I discovered that the cake was gone. My sister admitted that she had eaten it, even though she knew I had called dibs on it. She said she had a moment of weakness and thought it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nI got upset and accused her of being selfish and inconsiderate for eating the piece I had been looking forward to all day. She felt guilty and apologized, but I was still really hurt by her actions.\n\nMy sister offered to buy another cake or any other dessert of my choice to make it up to me, but I told her it's not about the cake itself. It's about her not respecting my wishes and taking something that I had clearly claimed.\n\nThis incident has made me reconsider living with my sister. I feel like our relationship is strained, and I'm thinking about moving out to have my own space and avoid any further conflicts. However, I'm aware that my sister can't afford the rent on her own, and if I move out, she'll likely have to move back in with our parents.\n\nMy sister thinks I'm overreacting about a small issue and that it's just a piece of cake. She has already apologized and offered to replace it, but I still feel hurt and disrespected.\n\nSo, AITA for considering moving out because my sister ate the last piece of cake I had been saving for myself, knowing she can't afford the rent on her own?", "created_utc": 1681004952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g58ob/aita_for_threatening_to_move_out_after_my_sister/", "score": 172, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, sometimes there will be miscommunication, or annoyances, or eating your food, or any number of conflicts. What matters is resolving it, and it sounds like your sister is more than willing to go above and beyond.

She apologized and offered to buy you a WHOLE new cake of your choice to replace the SLICE you lost! she could\u2019ve been the asshole and told you to get over it, which you should now only because she gave you a solution and you chose to be a person who childishly pulls the \u201cbut i called dibs!\u201d lowkey annoying thing to get pissed about. just get over it please, you\u2019re the asshole. Dont ruin your relationship with your sister over cake.", "\"My sister thinks I'm overreacting about a small issue,\"\n\n\"My sister offered to buy me another cake or any other dessert of my choice.\"\n\nYes, you are overreacting. Your sister has bent over backwards to repair the situation.\n\nThe punishment does not match the crime. She's said sorry and offered to correct it.\n\nUnless there are other situations where your sister has pushed boundaries, and this is the final blow, YTA.", "It\u2019s cake, get over it haha. YTA and pretty childish", ".....it's a piece of cake, unless there was literal gold in it yes YTA...", "NTA - Some people can't really get the concept of \"Never mess with someone food or meals\" it's a common sense but many seem doesn't had one.", "This isn\u2019t r/relationship, we\u2019re not analysing their relationship with one another, we\u2019re judging a very specific event, I think the info request is beyond the bounds of this judgement.", "Im sick of Reddit readers responses of \u201cwhat other boundaries have she crossed\u201d. It such a go to at this point it\u2019s pathetic. There is a time to ask this, this does not fit in the category. Mainly, because we can all think of a time of person has crossed our boundary when ask, even if they are the best bf, so, family member, etc.", "Makes me want to stand up and chant \"Jerry, Jerry, Jerry\"\n\nYTA, a chronic overreaction for something your sister apologised for and offered to rectify.", "Op sister will most likely benefit with another roommate than OP", "Unless they live in a post-apocalyptic world where every piece of food is the difference between life and death, this is blown waaaay out of proportion.

It's like people are filling in blanks that are not there. OP is NTA but is may be being too dramatic.", "Exactly... such a drama queen...

The cake is just the trigger. Siblings are notorious for getting into to stupid arguments that escalate just because they are arguing.
