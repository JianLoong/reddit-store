The younger niece just got married this past weekend, but she had only invited me and the other sister that went to the last wedding on the basis that they wanted to keep it small, and only invite people she thought would come. She asked us to keep it a secret until she was officially married, which we did. \n\nImmediately after the ceremony the younger niece sent a text to all of her aunts with the news of her marriage. Now all of our other sisters are outraged at me and my other sister for not sharing our niece\u2019s information and for going to the wedding at all. \n\nAn additional detail is that the wedding this weekend was on the other side of the country from all of the sisters. \n\nAITA for not telling my sisters about the wedding and for going to it knowing they weren\u2019t invited?", "created_utc": 1667159773, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yho6hi/aita_for_going_to_my_nieces_wedding_when_some_of/", "score": 242, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So your sisters expecting you to tell them about it makes less sense to me\n\nAlso, to go or not to go was your sole decision. If someone feels desrespected because you had the decency to attend your niece's wedding, they are the AH.", "NTA. Even in the smallest of weddings you can't please everyone. Her wedding she can do what she wants.", "NTA and wow that's a lot of sisters. Anyway it's your niece's decision to have as big or as small a wedding she likes, or to invite whomever she likes. You would have been the biggest AH had you violated your niece's trust by not keeping her secret.", "NTA, your niece can invite who ever she wants. She just prioritized the aunts who are actually there and not the absent ones. It's your other sisters' fault they did not get the invite. They should not expect you to also give up being a part of such a big moment in your niece's life. They should love your niece enough to say \" you know what, I didn't get invited but im glad OP is there for her\", congratulate her, ask to see a photo, tell her she looked beautiful and move on.", "NTA.\n\nYour niece's information is for your niece to share.  It is not your responsibility to be the local announcement agency unless you were asked to.\n\nYour sisters only care cuz they weren't asked to the wedding.  They don't seem to care about the nieces otherwise.", "NTA\n\nWhen are people going to get it through their thick heads that someone else's wedding is not about THEM.\n\nYour niece did what she felt was best for HER (which is what she should be doing). Refusing to attend because your sisters weren't invited would be making it about YOU. Keeping it a secret was the direct ask of your niece. You did nothing wrong.\n\nYour sisters are making an issue of it because of their internal recognition of their own past behavior, which they want to pretend doesn't exist. Tell them you were honoring the bride's wishes. Hopefully this is exceptional behavior for your sisters, not the norm, and you can all leave it behind.", "NTA. There's maybe lots of reasons about why they weren't invited: economic, personal, etc and it's not your fault at all. It's your niece's wedding and she can invite whoever she wants to, if your sisters are so offended they should talk to her, not be mad at you.", "Motivation is crucial. you don\u2019t really have to tell us, but \n1)why did the sisters not go to the first wedding? \n\nAs to the rest, you\u2019re not responsible for your sisters\u2019 relationship w/the family. She asked, you\u2019re close to her, you went.", "NTA. They felt disrespected from the last wedding, they chose not to come and they didn't give a shit. Now your other sisters are offended cuz they weren't invited? WTF?! It's obvious that your sisters didn't send them a nice congrats card either.", "NTA. I have a big family and only had 30 people at MY wedding (you cannot control who the bride invited nor was it your business to gossip). Let your sisters be mad, it was your nieces day and your sisters probably wouldn\u2019t have shown up anyways yet now want to be mad. Drama. And that\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t get an invite.", "I\u2019m curious, do you think your other sisters would have even shown up to this wedding as well? They are mad but don\u2019t seem to remember how they didn\u2019t bother to show up to the last one they were invited to which sounds like the reason for this decision. Family drama sucks and never will everyone be happy. You are NTA for showing up and supporting your niece and abiding by her request to not share the news. Good luck!", "Nta", "NTA. they played stupid games and won stupid prizes.", "NTA! The only people who should be at a wedding, are those whom the bride and groom want there. Family are not guaranteed an invite. I\u2019m really proud of your niece for having firm boundaries after the other aunts had made her and her sister feel disrespected in the past. It couldn\u2019t have been easy for her. Also, good for you, for respecting her enough to keep it a secret. Your other sisters are the AHs. They probably feel jilted and embarrassed by their past behavior, and are lashing out at you due to hurt feelings. They should work on repairing their relationship with their nieces, unless they don\u2019t want to miss out on more precious moments in their lives.", "NTA. You honoured the bride\u2019s reasonable wishes. No-one is owed an invite to a wedding, and their reaction (selfishly indignant rather than happy for the bride) shows your niece made the right choice.", "NTA \nyour niece is free to invite or not invite whoever to her wedding. Why didn't your sisters and Dad goto the older ones wedding when they were invited?", "NTA\n\nWeird how your niece handled it and put you in that position. You don't invite people just because you think they'll come. You invite people who you want to be there and they decide if they want to come.\n\n\nNot enough information to guess if your sisters are disrespectful to your nieces or maybe they are sensitive  or maybe both sides have personalities that are hard to get along with the other.\n\nAn invitation is not a summons so being mad someone can't travel to you has me kinda side eyeing them for being mad they didn't come.\n\n\nI can see where people would be insulted that they aren't invited and others that have the same familial relationships are. But again we have no idea if your sisters are rude and deserve to be snubbed but if they are why even bother sending out an announcement to them?", "NTA, the people who get married decide who they want to be present and if they didn\u2019t want certain family members there, those family members should ask the newlyweds why they weren\u2019t invited and not take it out on y\u2019all", "NTA. Kinda sucks your niece put you in the middle but it's her wedding at the end of yout day and you did try to include your sisters. Also did your younger niece get married to get revenge on your sisters on her own sister's behalf haha.", "NTA - her wedding, her guest list", "NTA you honored the bride's wishes. Also why didn't they go to the other wedding? Your niece was just treating them the way they treated her sister", "NTA. \n\nFor context I have ten siblings and twenty niblings. There should be a rule that when you have a large family you get to be picky about invitations. It's really hard to be as close to five aunts as two, especially if there's physical distance or a big age gap.", "Nta it was her wedding her choice", "NTA but the niece probably didn\u2019t handle the situation well. Asking you to lie to your sisters puts you in a shitty place and gives them reason to feel hurt/blindsighted. She doesn\u2019t have to invite them but probably shouldn\u2019t have kept it a secret. Keeping it a secret is her choice but it does give the sisters a reason to feel hurt and feel hurt that you specifically lied to them.", "NTA You respected the bride's wishes. You would have been an a-hole if you had done anything differently.", "NTA", "NTA Not your marriage, not your secret to share.", "NTA! I couldn't imagine not being at my niece's wedding. I'd have to be half dead in hospital. I'm not even that close with my niece we live on opposite sides of the country. The other sisters had a choice to go to the first wedding and didn't. I'd just assume they wouldn't want to come to the second one too. B/c that is really crappy of them to support one over the other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thanksgiving might be a few sisters short this year \u2639\ufe0f", "If only they thought like that. I really feel like this is going to be a big issue for years to come. There\u2019s always been minor spats here and there, but I\u2019ve always gotten along with each sister individually. They\u2019re all saying they feel betrayed. It\u2019s a really shitty feelings.

But they said they feel betrayed by us.", "As far as I know, they didn\u2019t go to the last wedding because it was on the east coast while we all live in the Midwest.

Don\u2019t think our dad would.", "It is relieving to hear you say that. But I still feel like I need to make things right with them. They\u2019ve never treated me like this.", "Afaik it was due to distance. The wedding was a few states away.", "My husband thinks it was a statement about them not going to the older niece\u2019s wedding. This is tearing me apart. I don\u2019t know what to say to them.", "Thank you! But that\u2019s not how it\u2019s playing out. My sisters are very emotional.", "That\u2019s how I felt! One of my sisters said we should have just not attended out of respect for those that weren\u2019t invited, but then we would be disrespecting our niece! Also I don\u2019t feel like it was disrespectful to them that we went, right?", "Thanks, that\u2019s exactly how we felt.", "I definitely knew they\u2019d be upset, but I didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be this upset at me and my other sister. \n\nThe ceremony is over, but the drama is just starting. We always do a big thanksgiving, but I think that probably won\u2019t happen this year.", "Obviously you are NTA. But I am curious. Did they ever give a reason for not going to the first cousin's wedding?", "If they wanted an invite then they should have done a better job maintaining a relationship with the niece. At the end of the day, it\u2019s on them for not maintaining and fostering a relationship with them.\n\nThey didn\u2019t get invited because of that.", "I understand. It's a situation I'm about to get in myself. Only inviting 3 of 7 aunts/uncles from my moms side. I'm sure the others will be mad/hurt but from a brides point of view, why should I pay for them/spouse/kid when they haven't really been there for me or apart of my life in years. \nYou did the right thing. As an aunt I would never not be there for my niece or nephew. If someone gets mad at me for that, it's on them.  It's not a fair ask because they decided to be absent, the person noticed and therefor quit including.", "Explain  the nieces-both of them -  felt  the exact  same  when the older one got married and  they didn't  attend. \n\n Also as a supportive  aunt you can't  miss her wedding  due to the decision  your SISTERS  MADE BY NOT ATTENDING THE LAST WEDDING.\n\n  They  need  to pull their head out of their b*t and accept  the consequences  of their actions. \n\nNta.", "I think you need to go LC or even NC because I feel like you are trying to be logical with people who are acting illogically. They weren't going to go to the wedding so why do they care that you did? You have a different (and closer) relationship with the niece so it makes sense you'd be invited. \n\nAnd have any of your sisters ever gone somewhere or attended something that you weren't invited to? I'm sure they have. People like that only care to complain when the situation is not in their favor but would never stand up for anyone else.", "You do you.  They do them.  They do not get to do you.  Let them behave like children.  It reflects on them.  Not you.\n\nYou were invited to the wedding.  I'm confident that the invite didn't advise that you had to get your sisters' permission to attend.  You responded with what worked for you.\n\nThey are mudslinging and hoping it hurts.  They will keep it up as long as they are getting a reaction.  You have responded and I suggest to cease all responding to them on this topic.  If you want, you can advise them that you are finished with this conversation (but they will likely continue but do not respond).", "So you and your other 2 sisters (one being the Mom) were invited. How many other sisters weren't? Are they all acting this way, or just the ringleader? Clearly they're very into themselves. Try to respond as little as possible. You won't get anywhere by reasoning with them unfortunately. Good luck with this situation, and maybe you can enjoy Thanksgiving without the drama queens this year \ud83d\ude03", "I know how difficult family can be. Honestly, the onus is on them to atone for their past actions. I\u2019m sorry you feel you need to capitulate to their demands. You owe them no excuses for supporting someone you love. I\u2019m 43f, and I\u2019ve only learned how important that is in the last year or so. It\u2019s taken a lot of work, but I\u2019m finally good about setting boundaries and truly supporting others with no strings attached. It takes a lot of work\u2764\ufe0f", "Your replies throughout this thread are surprising \u2014 you really didn\u2019t think they would be pretty upset at the secrecy? Certainly you knew you were taking a risk and decided to take it?", "You need to include this in your post. They didn\u2019t attend a wedding a few states away but are mad they weren\u2019t invited to a wedding across the country?", "That was the first thing I thought", "Oof, yeah. Not sure what else you can do other than stick to your guns and say it wasn\u2019t your wedding so it wasn\u2019t your call. Sorry man hopefully it blows over eventually, that kinda shit has a habit of sticking around. My sister-in-law still gets pissed at me for donating a sweater she got me fifteen years ago", "Emotional towards \n their own needs you mean.", "No, it's not. You don't control the guest list, and from what you've said, this isn't about the other aunts sincerely wanting to attend--they just wanted the right NOT to attend. The bride pre-empted them, and they're acting pissy because they lost the right of refusal. LAME.", "As far as I know it was because of distance.", "Thank you for the advice!", "Correct, me, one other sister and their mom. \n\n5 sisters and our dad were not invited. All of them are reacting super negatively toward me and the other invited sister.", "I knew they\u2019d be upset, I didn\u2019t think it would be future-event-ruining levels of upset. Also there would be people upset any choice that would be made. \n\nI was just wondering if people agreed with my sisters that I should have told them or shouldn\u2019t have gone.", "I don\u2019t know what you mean by that, but no, emotional in general. We all get that way."]}
