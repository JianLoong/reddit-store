The two of you need to learn communication and talk your problems out, not freak out at each other", "It is so funny to me that the new excuse is \"guy talk\". Because it is basically saying \"i would never lie to you. I only lie to my friends and family to make you look bad\" \n\n\nBecause either your dish is great or it isn't. And either he lied to you or his family.", "I don\u2019t think this was a \u201cleave the party immediately\u201d offense. I understand you were hurt and I don\u2019t blame you. It sounds like husband was just being a \u201cbro\u201d with BIL. It doesn\u2019t excuse what he did, but I don\u2019t think he meant it. It would have been better to pull him aside or wait until you got home and ask if he meant what he said, then tell him you don\u2019t appreciate jokes at your expense. How would he feel if you made jokes about his performance in the bedroom? I\u2019m going to say ESH, but I hope you can have an honest conversation about this with each other.\n\nAs an aside, your husband needs to understand that some people take those kinds of jokes way out of context. BIL might think husband is saying your cooking sucks. For example, I tend to drive really fast on tollways and expressways. My husband gets on me about it. Once a relative asked me how long it took us to get to a family vacation home. I joked, \u201cIt depends on who\u2019s driving.\u201d She took that to mean something completely different, and later said that I said my husband drives like a grandma. Which is not at all what I said or meant. I had to stop her right there and explain, and I vowed never to make that kind of ambiguous joke again. Your husband wasn\u2019t as ambiguous and he should knock it off.", "YTA\n\nSo your FIL is terminally ill, this might be his last NYE ever before he dies. While at a party at FIL's House, you over heard your husband joke that certain restaurant in town makes certain dish better than you. And your reaction was to storm off and created a huge scene. \n\nYou completely overreacted. Your husband didn't insult you in any way. He simply joked that a restaurant dish might be better than yours. You sound like a completely self centered princess who creates drama when there's none. You owe your husband and his family a huge apology, because your unnecessary self created drama ruined a pleasant NYE that might be your FIL's last one, too.", "YTA for that grand exit. And unless you\u2019re Julia Child, I would try and come back down to reality a bit.", "YTA - I was going to go with E.S.H. but you were so much worse than your husband\n\nIt was a bit of a tasteless joke (no pun intended) but, unless you're a professional chef, then it's hardly an insult. You'd hope professional food was better than home cooking\n\nYou completely over-reacted. You could have given a casual (sarcastic) comment of 'well that's charming', and laughed it off together...even if you'd been hurt and wanted to discuss it later in private\n\nThe context of his father being ill makes your behaviour even less excusable", "NTA. Husband bit the hand that feeds him. When the women are in the kitchen making food for the party, the men who are not helping cook can shut their pie holes with any criticism (joking or not) about food.", " YTA. I can't believe the N T A comments here. saying someone's cooking isn't as good as a professional kitchen is by no means an insult, the fact that your cooking is compared to a restaurant is a complement.\n\nyou getting so insulted at what he said to the point you had to storm out of the party when you know what the party meant for some of the guests indicates you have an ego the size of Jupiter and you are difficult to deal with.", "YTA\n\nI would guess you're known as the drama queen. \n\nA simple \"you're an asshole\" directed towards your husband would have sufficed.

These husbands who make their spouses the butt of a joke behind their backs (this is the key: laughing about them, not with them) have such a stale humour and lack respect for their wives while trying to be \"bro\" with the other men.\n\nBut this is Reddit so I don't think many will admit how sad and frequent this dynamic is lol", "ESH he definitely shouldn\u2019t be trash talking you behind your back, on the other hand causing a scene was a bit much, especially with the whole dying dad thing.\n\nit seems you both need too have a conversation about this, how having hurt feelings don\u2019t make you a princess & making those kinda jokes about you makes him the one that should grow up.", "YTA. It was just a light-hearted joke, he didn\u2019t use any mean language. You didn\u2019t have to make the atmosphere uncomfortable by storming out. It could\u2019ve been a calm conversation once home, \u201chey, I heard you say this and it bothered me\u201d.", "Going against the grain here, but NTA. Your husband should never make fun of you behind your back. He should be honest if he doesn\u2019t like your dish/ doesn\u2019t like it as much as a restaurant\u2019s. As someone who prides myself in my cooking, I\u2019d be very hurt (and have been) if I found out my husband didn\u2019t like something I made and lied about it.\n\nWe actually had a conversation because it was drilled into him to always say he enjoyed my food, even if it was bad. He finally broke down and told me he hated a dish I was making often because he liked it so much - turns out neither one of us liked it but I was making it for him! It hurt to know he had lied to me just to placate me, and sometimes it hurts to know he doesn\u2019t like a dish I enjoy, but constructive criticism is just that - a way to learn and grow from what you\u2019ve learned.\n\nY\u2019all may benefit from having a conversation like this. Find out why he feels the need to lie to you; if it\u2019s rooted in what you want or what he thinks you want. Explain why this hurt you, and how to avoid this happening again. Maybe there\u2019s some way you can edit your recipe that is more to his liking.", "YTA, \n\nFirst of all he didn\u2019t say anything derogatory about your cooking. He just said the restaurants one was better. \n\nI am a home cook, I love cooking, I am confident that i\u2019m a good cook and I love hearing compliments about my cooking. But I don\u2019t expect anyone to say that I\u2019m better than their favorite restaurant. Restaurants have better ingredients, trained experienced and educated chefs, so I know it\u2019s unrealistic for me to have the same skill level.  \n\nYou are allowed to be hurt, but this was the most unsuitable situation to leave a function. His dads last celebration!!!! Where is your empathy??  \n\nBeing mad at your husband would have been okay but why couldn\u2019t you do it later in a private situation, ultimately you ended up hurting his sick dad and souring his last few memories with his family.", "NTA. \u2018Just guy talk\u2019 is basically a cover for \u2018I can say anything crass,hurtful, or unpleasant about my partner with no repercussions\u2019. Maybe he did lie to you about your food being good and maybe it\u2019s delicious and so is the restaurants. The real point here is he made you the butt of a joke to make himself look good and said something hurtful in the process. He didn\u2019t have to say it. He could have said they were both good but he went for a quick bit of shitty humour because he thought you wouldn\u2019t hear. He played a stupid game and got a stupid prize. \n\nWas walking out a bit much? Possibly. Was shouting at him over the top? Probably. In hindsight it would have been better to pull him aside talk to him about how it wasn\u2019t appropriate and that you were leave as you didn\u2019t feel like celebrating anymore. But I don\u2019t think your overreaction makes you an AH, just human.", "ESH what I'm hearing from the tone 'was she there when I said it?' Is\n'Everything that comes out of my mouth when my wife is around may or may not be true.' which is totally bullshit. \n\nIn an ideal world if you overhead your partner spouting this shit you call out 'I heard that' everyone laughs and he apologizes later in private. Op only you know what's going on with you guys, walking out wasn't the best move but maybe in the moment it saved a bigger blow out.", "NTA. Although leaving was a bit dramatic... it would've been better if you just confronted him, jokingly \"oh is that so?!...\". The fact that you weren't \"supposed to hear\u00a0it\" just adds injury to insult . If he had said it in front of you, he would be laughing with you; when he says behind your back, he's laughing *at* you.", "That\u2019s a pretty innocuous joke to leave a party over, especially considering FIL. I understand being annoyed, but is there something more to it that made it such an offensive statement to you. He didn\u2019t say your cooking was bad or imply it\u2014the joke was he lied about yours being better than the restaurant to flatter you, not that yours was bad. While not a great joke, it\u2019s at his expense as well as yours and I\u2019m having trouble imagining how that on it\u2019s own made you snap. You seem to understand the joke wrong too as it\u2019s not even about your food really. Nothing suggests your food is bad in the joke, though it does suggest you like to be flattered and he\u2019s a liar and it\u2019s a crappy oldschool joke, maybe even relying on sexist joke tropes about marriage I\u2019m not crazy about.\n\nIs there something else I\u2019m missing or something else he did that was bothering you? Some kind of pattern? Have you discussed this issue before? If not, I\u2019m going with soft YTA though it is a bad joke, leaving was giving a $100 punishment for a penny crime so to speak. And actually reinforcing the punchline of the joke, which is that he lies to placate you, I guess.", "YTA and your reaction was over the top. It was a harmless joke and you stormed out like a child because he implied your dish isn't as good as a restaurant? I'm a pretty good cook and I would not be offended that a professional chef made something better than me. You also made a scene and ruined other people's holiday as well.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband disrespected you because he thought you wouldn't hear. He also complained you were acting childish because you walked out however it seems like you've just left peacefully- *your husband* on the other hand freaked out, and obviously knows he was in the wrong as he blamed it on \"guy talk\". \n\nPeople can rant about their spouses/partners but your husband was not only disrespecting you, but he was literally talking shit to his family- who I'm assuming you have tried hard to get along with. \n\nYour husband also calling you a princess and talking about a \"private convo\" makes it seem like he is disregarding your feelings and dismissing them as clearly he isn't in the wrong and you going to the toilet is in the wrong (/s). \n\nI would recommend following this to just not cook for him, and see how you feel and if you do feel deeply about this I would see how you feel about going to a couples/seperate therapy to talk it out.", "YTA. Did you actually think you made the best food in the entire city? Better than a professional restaurant? Come on. It's just a little joke.\n\nHe says it because he loves you. It's like saying someone is the most beautiful person in the world. Not everyone is married to literally the most physically attractive person \u2013 nor should they want to be! \u2013 but you say things like that because you love someone.\n\nImagine you had a husband who said 'my wife makes the 7th best <dish> within 15km of our house. People say slightly different things to different people because of their emotional relationships. The people who are always 'brutally honest' are assholes.\n\nYou should try to ignore small slights you overhear, everyone says things like that. And you massively overreacted and behaved like a complete drama queen. Go apologise.", "Holy inferiority complex, Batman!\n\nYTA for storming out. And people blowing this out of proportion should chill. OP seems very insecure about her cooking skills. It\u2019s probably safer to say \u201cyes baby, nobody ever produced a better dish than you!\u201d than deal with the tantrum.

You chose to remove yourself from the situation. \n\nHe said an AH comment. The fact that he\u2019s upset that it was \u201cprivate\u201d doesn\u2019t make it any better. He shouldn\u2019t be saying anything in private that he doesn\u2019t want you to hear. Also the princess comment was unnecessary. He is the one talking poorly behind someone\u2019s back and then name calling that same person later. Sounds pretty childish to me.", "Yta. Utter overreaction. Don't be so precious", "I would have interrupted the conversation, tell them I heard that, and say we'll talk about this later. Let him stew. If he says it's a joke, pretend to laugh in an obviously fake not-wanting-to-make-a-scene way. Then leave.\n\nWhen I get home, say I'm over it, and graciously continue to cook, all smiles, ask him if it's to his liking. If not, he can take me out to this restaurant he was bragging about.", "Dramatic for sure YTA", "YTA. A drama queen. Also you need a reality check. Did you really think your food was the best in town? And it wasn't just a hyperbolic compliment to make you feel good? Because if you did you are also delusional.", "Maybe? Seems like ESH situation. No info if you are, but if you are not a chef can you realistically expect for that \u201cbest dish\u201d statement to ever be true?", "YTA for the overreaction, though I do understand your right to be upset by this. He didn't say he didn't like your dish, but I think it's pretty common that restaurant food *is* just better than what we can make at home. They are professional chefs!!\n\nYour husband didn't mean to hurt you and he didn't mean to say this in earshot of you. People are allowed to say lighthearted things about other people. Imagine where we could *never* do this. That seems a little unreasonable, right?\n\nSo while I understand being a bit taken aback and initially hurt, leaving the party in a huff was a pretty immature reaction. You could have pulled your husband aside privately, after the party was over, and admitted that you overheard him and were hurt. That would have been the non-AH way to respond to this situation.", "Yeah, YTA. It was obviously a joke, you went way overboard with your reaction. Unless you're someone who enjoys the drama? And are you seriously going to deny ever joking about your husband with your friends?", "YTA. Complete overreaction. Spoiled an important occasion with a dying relative. Acted like a drama queen. \n\nEverything is not about you.", "YTA. You made a mountain out of a molehill. You overheard a private joking conversation between brothers, and even if it was hurtful for you to hear, it was something that could be addressed privately later. He didn't say thing in front of a group, and for all you knew he could be just kidding around with his sibling. You decided to transform this small personal issue into a giant drama and trashed EVERYONE'S NYE - your TERMINAL FIL's event. Shame on you. You are entitled to your feelings, but that does NOT entitle you to behave rudely or ruin a treasured memory event for everyone else.", "YTA\nWas it a nice joke? No. Was it worth ruining your FIL 's last NYE over it? Also no. Get a little perspective.", "YTA! Yeah your husband has been lying to you about how good your cooking is but to be fair what kind of idiot thinks her cooking is the best in town? Even compared to professional chefs? I can see why he would lie... add selfish to Y-T-A", "Esh I understand you were hurt, husband told very hurtful joke and implied that he has to lie around you just because, on the other hand it was stupid joke and because of that you had to ruin everyone's NYE, his father is dying and you had to make a scene for his probably last NYE. You both are AH it this scenario, BUT you are definitely the bigger one, others unfortunately paid the price...", "YTA\n\nHe didn't say your cooking was awful. He was joking about it being the best. Best reaction would have been to joke back that he's been pulling your leg this whole time; or if you were really bothered, talking about it when you reached home, and maybe ask what he thinks the dish lacks to improve it.\n\nUnless he frequently trash talks you over many other things that's why you exploded? If it's only about this, then your reaction was OTT, no wonder he feels compelled to (white) lie. And you'd better apologize to him and his dad.", "YTA - it was just guys shit talking. A better response would have been to walk in and call him out on it and watch it blow up in his face. \n\nBut instead you threw a tantrum at a dying man\u2019s last NYE.", "YTA he didn't even say you were a bad cook. He just said you're dish wasn't the best in town. You completely overreacted to the comment.", "Bottom line... you both need to work on your maturity. You need to work on accepting that a stupid joke is a stupid joke and having that conversation with him at an appropriate time. You weren't wrong to be hurt, but you handled the situation poorly. Your husband needs to work on not talking poorly about his wife, even as a joke. Communicate, and apologize to your FIL, he deserves that. This is something easily manageable. \n\nYour husband sucks because honestly... \"guy talk I wasn't supposed to hear\" isn't a good or valid excuse to cut your wife down. He also should take an eggsit on the \"wrong to hear their private convo\" anything you say within the home where you might be heard is open game for anyone to hear. How would this scenario have played out if he was talking about the children (if they exist or not isn't the point of this) and he said something hurtful that they overheard and had that kind of reaction, or a more explosive one? What if he had said that and you had a brother who wasn't willing to put up with that and stepped up? If you can't say a joke in front of your wife about your wife, don't say the joke. Actions do have consequences.  \n\n\nBottom line... you both need to work on your maturity.

Absolutely the husband is TAH.", "ESH but you more .  He shouldn't have been making you the punchline, but his dad is DYING. That is slightly more important than finding out he thinks you only make the second best lasagna in town. But instead of allowing your husband to make this holiday about saying goodbye to his dad then telling him later he hurt your feelings later, you decided to make the whole thing about you", "YTA. You made a scene for no reason and then stormed off like a child. \n\nI get it you were hurt by his comment, but there was no need to run off like that.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m shocked at the comments. This is such a minor joke, and I\u2019m someone who loves to cook and tends to be a little sensitive about my cooking. All he said was that it might be second best instead of the best. He was not belittling you or your cooking. Your reaction was absolutely over the top.", "YTA - it was an inoffensive joke, he didn't even say he doesn't like your dish, just that the restaurant's is best. If you were upset by it, you should have talked to him, not made a scene that disrupted the party", "YTA\n\nYou ruined a terminally ill man's NYE celebration...over a cooking comment?\n\nYour husband didn't even say anything bad about your cooking. He simply said the restaurant was better, he just made you believe yours was the best.\n\nNow if he had said something that your cooking was horrendous or poisonous, that would've been grounds to be upset. Instead he said \"Wife's cooking is good, but **a professional cook** is better.\"\n\nYes, your husband admitted to lying but it was a white lie to hurt your feelings.

Having someone dying isn't a reason to put down someone who is your support system.", "I think YTA\n\nIt's not like he said your food was the WORST in town, or that it was bad in any way. He just said X restaurant was the best, and joked that he obviously has to tell you yours is best if you're with him. \n\nIt all seems pretty harmless to me? I've told my fianc\u00e9 he's made me the best cup of tea ever, but I'd recommend all my friends go to a specific cafe with me because I think they have the best tea in my city.

I understand being hurt but walking out and yelling at him in company (especially during a NYE party that may be the last for his dad) was not equal to the level of the joke.

It was a joke made in bad taste (all puns intended), but it wasn't a derogatory conversation. To be that offended that a professional cook can make a dish better than you is beyond silly. \n\nHis father is terminal, and you decided it was the best time to cause a scene over a joke that in all reality isn't offensive unless you left out the fact that you're a professional chef and work at the competing restaurant to the one he named.", "YTA", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand how you were TA.

Great husbands lift up their spouses not put them down. \n\nOP\u2019s husband could definitely made a snappy joke that made OP feel special.

What she says is that she turned around, picked up her purse and her coat, and walked out. Or are people just assuming that her screaming fir him to leave her alone happened inside the house? The image conjured in my head by what she wrote implies that that argument happened outside, between the front door and the car, but maybe that\u2019s just me. But either way, it doesn\u2019t exactly sound like he handled it great either. Even if he caught her before she exited the house, and asked why she was leaving, did he have to be an entire asshole about it? Still seems to me like he made the scene (again unless there\u2019s a comment somewhere where OP admits to walking through the house on her way out screaming about her bastard shit-talking husband, in which case I retract this argument).

Dumb to open his mouth at this party (maybe that's a white lie you don't let your friends and family in on), but more understandable that he ever constructed this white lie if she's prone to reacting badly to not being told she's the best at certain things.", "\u201cThe best X in town\u201d is a colloquial expression that no well-adjusted person takes to be a literal statement of fact.", "Yes!!!!", "It\u2019s not about you though? It\u2019s about her and how she felt. The fact that he had the nerve you say you weren\u2019t even supposed to be listening. Shows he\u2019s guilty af and knows he shouldn\u2019t have said it. Imagine the the delusion to turn it on her. Wild", "You are ignorant on the topic. People lie all the time (average four per day) and it doesn't mean that there is malicious intent. And what was the lie? That OP doesn't make the best dish in the entire world, that there might be a professional chef who makes the dish better? And this lie is so bad that OP needed to storm out of her FIL (who is dying) last NYE party?", "I don\u2019t understand how people who take things this seriously stay married.", "Then prepare to get livid. Because it will happen. You annoy her with something small. Nothing to be seriously pissed off about but enough to vent to her friends. That is totally normal. \n\nPeople, just top being so full of yourself that a simple joke is offending you so much.", "But you wouldn't be a fanny packet and run away with flapping hands while her terminally ill mother is sitting there with a smile on her face, with her mind finally not focused on her disease and what lies ahead; dragging her back to the ground and ruining one of her last festive moments.\n\nIf you would...then you would also be an asshole, like op is. To OP YTA.", "He\u2019s letting her do all the work with the other women in the kitchen while he literally makes jokes about her. He basically told his BIL that if he says something in front of his wife, he\u2019s lying & she\u2019s too stupid to realise it.\n\nA drama queen would kick off on the spot, someone who feels disrespected & hurt leaves the situation. \n\nI just think her should have more respect for the woman he married", "Really? Extremely disrespected?\n\nMan alive how are people like this ever married?", "I know. But sometimes my boyfriend says he likes my food other times he straits tell me it doesn't taste good. But it's okay because in our relationship we always tell the truth, and it is like that our relationship works. But not all the relationships are like that. So she probably feels like everything he said to be he was telling a white lie to her. I don't know", "Exactly. I haven't met one woman who hasn't joked about their partner at some point, when talking with other women.", ">Maybe so, in which case she should have behaved as an adult and spoken to her husband about it at a more appropriate time.\n\nSo he could lie to her again?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I turned around, grabbed my bag and phone and made my way out of the house. My husband freaked out trying to get ne to stop and go back inside but I yelled at him to leave me alone then went home. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, who freaked out? Cause it sounds like HE could have just let her go and there would have been no scene.", "Yes, just because the pro was better, doesn't mean hers isn't also great.  But it to say it in a sly way that implies the opposite...this is why it is best to not be that person that is always talking smack about someone out of their earshot for social points.", "I have to respectfully disagree. He\u2019s insinuating that the only reason he said something positive about her cooking is because she was there. It could really mean  a lot of things, the truth is we don\u2019t know exactly what, but we do know it wasn\u2019t anything good. That\u2019s not something you do to your significant other. \n\nI do think you\u2019re right about there being a past involving disrespect for her reaction to be such a strong one.", "These posts are beyond ridiculous. Every time, it goes straight to \"your spouse hates you, time to get a divorce\". This sub feels like 14 year olds giving relationship advice.", "Agreed. I think she overreacted. A lot of people do this, and I wouldn\u2019t take it personally. Not unless he does this all of the time, or says this about lots of different things.", "The guy he was talking to said \u201cI thought you said your wife\u2019s is the best\u201d\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t say no I didn\u2019t say it was the best. He said that he only said that cause she was there.\n\nNo implication - the other guy literally uses the phrase and the husband doesn\u2019t disagree.", "Agreed", "I fail to see it as well. If anything, it\u2019s very sweet that he talks about her dish in public like it\u2019s the best one in town. It\u2019s a lie, but one to make her feel good about herself.", "He didn't even say her dish wasn't good, just that the restaurant's is better. He didn't talk down about her or insult her abilities. The phrasing was fine and interpreting this as a sign that he may not love her is an extreme overreaction.", "Talk like what? Like you don't actually make the best food in town? \n\nIt is normal to lie about stuff like this. \"Wow honey this was the best food I ever had\" is a normal white lie.", ">He\u2019s letting her do all the work with the other women in the kitchen\n\nThat's just you projecting\n\n>He basically told his BIL that if he says something in front of his wife, he\u2019s lying & she\u2019s too stupid to realise it.\n\nThat's just your interpretation\n\n>A drama queen would kick off on the spot, someone who feels disrespected & hurt leaves the situation. \n\nThat's just... BS nuance \n\nYou (and OP) are working real hard to get outraged, that's what makes it drama queeny. 95% of the commenters see it as harmless banter.", "Successfully for many years, because we aren't casual dicks to each other like OP's husband.", "Fair enough. I'd say you can interpret the situation either way, but it all depends on their usual relationship dynamic. If anything, her reaction tells us it was more likely mean spirited than playful banter.\n\nHowever, I personally don't think it's very realistic to never say anything remotely negative or disrespectful about your significant other. While not nice, it can totally happen over the course of a long relationship and it may or may not mean anything deeper. There's a lot more to weigh in like topic, frequency, and how you go from there etc. I don't say it's always harmless, just that it can be.", "Yup. Quite disgusting and disturbing at times.", "saying it isn\u2019t \u201cthe best\u201d doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t like it though? it just means he thinks the restaurants is better\u2026", "He admits (or maybe jokes) that he lied to her about hers being the best dish but the lie might only be that it's actually 2nd best. If she'd hung around rather than walking out on him and his dying dad maybe we'd know more.", "Having a good, hearty laugh about lying to your spouse is completly normal, my bad I never expirienced a healthy relationship with the fun of bashing each other behind the back. /s\n\nWell you learn something new everyday", "Or \"darling, you're the funniest guy I've ever seen\" . Like she never saw an actual professional comedian before.", "I believe it was more the part where he laughed about lying to her face, that shit is not normal. \n\n\"Was she there?\" \"Yes\" \"So there you go\" ha ha ha ha\n\nIf you think this is normal behavour fine, I just think it is not insane to be hurt by this. \n\nBy the way the reaction of OP was too much granted, but normalizing bashing behind each others back is not great either.", "Me projecting? Does it not say that the women are in the kitchen & men in the living room? \n\nWhy is my interpretation less valid than yours? He said that!\n\nAnd no, quietly leaving a situation is not being a drama queen, there were many ways she could have been a drama queen. \n\nI\u2019m not being outraged, simply expressing that her husband shouldn\u2019t make her the butt of his jokes & that it\u2019s disrespectful. \n\nBanter involves the person you\u2019re talking about, you know, friendly rib poking?", ">the fun of bashing each other behind the back.\n\nWhen, exactly, did the husband bash OP? He didn't. All he said was that he told a white lie to his wife about her dish being the best. That's it. The kind of white lie that most people tell their partners constantly. \"You're the best lover in the world. You are the most handsome man alive. You are the best cook ever.\" All statements that can't possibly be true. \"Bashing\" her would have been if he said her food was awful and he only forces it down because he has no choice.", "Normalizing bashing\u2026like I just can\u2019t comprehend how that is bashing. What is the insult? That he loves her and cares about her feelings?", ">Why is my interpretation less valid than yours? He said that\n\nThe difference is I am not interpreting anything while you are.", "That gave me good laugh, thank you! He could have just said that her cooking is good blah blah blah but he decided to have a little fun with his BIL instead, so no the dish is not the issue I assume but how he said it. \n\nHis comment implied that to him it is normal to lie to her face and then turn around and then crack some jokes about it, so no I do not see the love from this.", "I dunno how to do the quote thing but I\u2019m sure you can re-read it if you wish - I don\u2019t think I read between the lines there, the intent seems pretty clear", ">Husband: \"I wanna take you to (restaurant's name) tomorrow. They make the best (dish name) in town!\n\n>BIL: \"Hold up, I thought you said (my name) makes the best (dish name) in town!\n\n>Husband: \"...Was she there when I said it?\".\n\n>BIL: \"...yes!\"\n\n>Husband: \"Well, there you go!\""]}
