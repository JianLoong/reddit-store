The way you describe this it is giving SERIOUS financial abuse red flags. He is being greedy and controlling. I don't like this for you at all.", "Red flag \ud83d\udea9 \nThis is not a marriage it\u2019s owner and slave.", "What's mine is mine and what's yours is mine...", "NTA based on the information provided, and his behavior is at minimum overly prideful. It seems very financially abusive.\n\nPre-nups are amendable when both parties agree. Your pre-nup should have been mutually amended when you moved and quit your job for his career. It's never too late to do it now. \n\nHe is setting very clear financial expectations, match his energy. You will do what he is asking, as long as it is clearly outlined in an amended pre-nup that is negotiated with a lawyer, not his father. \n\nAnd if he says he's not willing to do that, you should really explore that more deeply.", "NTA, this is getting into financial abuse.  He doesn\u2019t want you to have your own money for a reason AND he\u2019s controlling how much you could possibly make.", "Please leave. I haven't even met you, and I care about you. More than he does. You are being abused. Read these comments and follow the advice. I've seen some excellent advice already. Respect yourself, and leave. Good luck. NTA.", "NTA. Also, many have pointed out the financial abuse. The fact that he made a \u2018rule\u2019 you could only work part time? He is controlling and I can guaran-damn-tee he is gaslighting you about a myriad of things. Please don\u2019t give yourself a list of \u2018but he\u2019s\u2026.\u2019   \n\nBut he loves me!\nBut he provides for me\nBut he is helping me\nBut he is the only way I can survive \nEtc etc\n\nAnd you may love him very much, but the way he is treating you isn\u2019t very loving. You\u2019re his property, in his mind. You are incapable of taking care of yourself. You NEED him. He\u2019s only asking these things to protect me. Etc \n\nIf your best girlfriend told you this story, what would you say to her? Would it seem ok? Does she sound happy? You deserve better. Unless he\u2019s willing to go to therapy this week and honestly take a look deep into his behavior, there\u2019s no hope. And you need to leave asap. Good luck. Please post an update \n\nYou can do this and get out. If you have family that can support you, go now. Tomorrow. If not, another commenter laid out a great plan to follow. Be safe. Take care of YOU.", "NTA Isolation and financial abuse. Run away!", "NTA. You need to leave him before this escalates. He can't impose rules on you!", "OP, what he's doing to you I straight out of an abusers playbook \n\nYou quit your high paying job and gave up your career... and for what?\n\nWhat is inthat small town for you?\n\nHe controls your finances. He controls YOU.\n\nPlease get out of this and see if you can get your old career back. Oh man this is really bad OP\n\nNTA obviously", "\" I just got a part time job (his rule is it must be part time) and I am wanting to put all earning into a savings account, but he wants access to it. I told him I don\u2019t feel comfortable about that because he has always said his money is his money and never allowed me any of his earnings and that should be enough because he provides for us. But when I make money it\u2019s suddenly our money?\"\n\nNTA.", "RUN!!

This is such bullshit gaslighting (I think I've correctly identified it!).  Learn the cycle of abuse in particular and see how it applies to your situation.  And come back here often for reality checks if you need it.  \n\nAbusers like to keep you off balance and use excuses/abuse to make you question your own sanity. (I may not be explaining well) But take a look at some resources and talk to someone.", "I was going to say the same thing. Major red flags here.", "Unfortunately people don't see the kind of situation they're in for a while especially when it comes to financial abuse, this reads as such. She wanted to make her husband happy. It doesn't make her weak, but she definitely needs to take a step back and look at her marriage. And hopefully she gets out.", "Because it happens gradually. if it was all sudden that would be too obvious. But its like death by a thousand cuts until you realize you live in a new town with no job, no prospect of a new job, a husband who doesn't value you as anything other than a maid and no access to family funds like OP.\n\nOP, please think long and hard about exactly what you are getting out of this marriage. It seems like he gets EVERYTHING while you get what is left over... and even that you have to share with him.\n\nEdited to add: NTA", "Thanks. It comes from experience, unfortunately.", "A huge NTA !! And if you don't \"do something\" , it will get way worse. I would be GONE .  A marriage is a partnership, not a money grab and control.

This is really concerning if he didn\u2019t stand up for you and is now treating you this way. If he doesn\u2019t share you shouldn\u2019t too. And him having rules on what kind of job you have is absurd, did he want a wife or a housekeeper?", "You can love someone and still leave them. You can love someone and still choose not to accept their abuse. You can love someone and realize that your life is valuable and your independence is valuable, and choose to take care of yourself. You love him, but he is taking advantage of your love. He is using your love to control you for his convenience. He's probably very nice and fun when you're doing everything \"right\", but a loving relationship is reciprocal. There shouldn't be a behavioral checklist for one person in the relationship. He shouldn't be the only one who gets fun money, and savings, and independence. And if his love is conditional on him being in control, it is not love. \n\nYou can love him and still leave because your life is valuable, and so is your independence.", "Yeeesh, the apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree, does it?

You can love your partner, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he is without a doubt abusing you as said by pretty much every comment. What you described appears to be generational, his father has been married 5 times? Wonder where the idea for this prenup came from that only benefits his son?
