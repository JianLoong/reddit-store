Maybe 5% of marriage experts and/or couples counselors think separate finances are advantageous to a marriage or long-term committed relationship.  And it\u2019s for reasons just like this.  Just look at all of the posts in here about couples with differing incomes and how much strife it causes.  Yes, it works for some.  But what inevitably happens is that someone won\u2019t spend money for the perceived benefit of the other if they think such spending is a bad idea or selfish or you name it.  Did you see the post in here about the couple who had a child and the husband wouldn\u2019t pay anything towards his wife\u2019s epidural during labor and delivery and saying she should have \u201ctoughed it out\u201d?  Or the lady who got mad at her S/O for taking \u201cher food\u201d, so she used her own money to buy a $3,000 fridge for the garage with a padlock?  Most places are community property meaning that at the end of the relationship, everything is divided 50/50 anyway, so the only reason I can see for needing completely separate finances is so that one spouse can hold influence and control over the other.  That\u2019s not a partnership, that\u2019s an employer/employee relationship.  If what you say is true, and I have no basis to determine whether it is or is not, he\u2019s using money to control your behavior.
