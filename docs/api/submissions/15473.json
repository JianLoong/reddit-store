Like, 9-11 years older, I\u2019m the baby. My cousin was the closest I\u2019ve ever had to a sibling who was near my age. We grew really close when he had to live with my family as we were kids for like a year or so. Went to the same school, in the same classes, at lunch.

As young adults he had to come live with us for a different reason and we attended community college together.\n\nAbout a few months to a year later he tells me he and his fianc\u00e9 decided not to have a wedding party. Citing financial reasons and not wanting to deal with the politics of weddings. I was bummed but you know what, I was like \u201cHey, it\u2019s you\u2019re wedding!

I thought they were not going to have one.\u201d\n\nApparently he changed his mind. It\u2019s his wedding. They can do what they want. I\u2019m adult enough to comprehend that. What I don\u2019t comprehend that I was never told I was out of the wedding party. Not even a disinvite or a conversation about it. Just booted off the wedding party and sitting at the tables/pews/whathaveyou.\n\nHe has his nephew as the best man. His sister part of his fianc\u00e9\u2019s party. Members of her family within his. I\u2019m confused, hurt and a tad miffed that he just did that. I\u2019m told he could\u2019ve forgotten but\u2026 who forgets that? Like, I\u2019m not some distant relative or estrange cousin. He even decided to do the mother and son (his mum unfortunately has passed) which his future mother-in-law rather than my own mom who was literally a mother figure to him. \n\nI just feel like he want to embrace the his new family aside to where I feel like we\u2019re being discarded.\n\nSure, I could instigate the conversation but I just feel like\u2026 it\u2019s not my place. His wedding. His money. His life. I don\u2019t have the right to even interject like that.
