Our sons are now 10 and 8 and our daughter is 6. Amy passed away 2 years ago from cancer. She was sick for a little over a year and at a terminal diagnosis for 8 months. I helped care for Amy at home with the help of her family (her mom, four siblings and even her grandparents) before she died. And her death appeared peaceful. But Amy's twin Ivy recently discovered that toward the end Amy had been dealing with some crap... curtsey of my parents. \n\nPer Amy's diary she kept before she died, my parents had requested that she write letters to our kids telling them she wanted them to have another mom some day soon and that she wanted them to promise to have their hearts and minds open to that and to not treat my next wife as just my wife or just a stepmom but a mom. They also wanted her to tell the kids to ask me for a new mom within a few months of her death. She was supposed to tell them it was her dying wish and all sorts of crap. Amy had told them she had recorded videos and wrote letters but that those were not words she would put in either. My parents hounded her every second she was alone and they were visiting. They made her so distressed in the end. According to the diary my parents told Amy she was a terrible mother and a selfish person for not urging us to move on and find another wife and mom once she was no longer here.\n\nI read those pages myself and I was furious. Even more so because my parents have been urging me to date and explore the prospect of remarrying and when I said I had no interest in that, they told me it's what Amy would have wanted for me. They even brought up in the last few months that my kids will grow up without a mom. And argued when I told them they always will. Because she died while they were so young.\n\nI texted my parents that I knew what they had done and to stay away from me and the kids. They told me they had done nothing wrong and had no regrets about their actions to make mine and the kids lives better. That pushed me over the edge and I drove to their house to tell them face to face that they repulsed me, to harass a dying woman, to harass my wife, to make her final weeks more stressful than they already were. I told them they were sick. I didn't realize when I started that they had friends over. The friends came out to find out what was going on so I told them what my parents had done. Then I left.\n\nMy parents tried to defend their actions via text saying I should be so hurt and angry at Amy and not them. When I ignored them they told me I had no right to humiliate them in front of their friends. My siblings also told me I shouldn't have said anything to my parents. They said I should understand they were putting me first. I asked them if they thought our parents would have harassed me the same way if I had been in Amy's place and they couldn't deny that my parents wouldn't have.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704461441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18z6xhq/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_repulse_me_and/", "score": 3097, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please keep your children away from your parents. This is no telling what deluded things they will say to them. Maybe telling them also to be mad at their mother or worse.", "NTA. OMG, I don't think there's any coming back from this. They tried to manipulate children and made Amy's final months miserable. I hope you and your children can get past this, and I'd consider never speaking to your emotionally abusive parents (and your siblings who support them) again. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA.

How have they tried to manipulate them in the past and what would they whisper in their ear when you\u2019re not around in the future?\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss OP and that your parents are adding onto it in this way.

It was made clear they never gave two shits about my mom. My sister and I were totally guilt tripped about it too, but we are VERY outspoken and told multiple family members to fuck off and butt out. My dad did remarry, we can\u2019t stand his new wife, so we hardly ever see or speak to him anymore, and we\u2019ve had no contact with anyone in his family for close to 2 decades now.  \n\nThis could potentially be your kids future.

They\u2019re only that to HER & she took that with her, taking a piece of them & their childhood. Can the \u201cnew mom\u201d give that back to them? \n\nYour parents are trying to erase pain.

You didn't know your parents friends where there when you started yelling at them and choosing to continue after you saw them was a act of passion.
