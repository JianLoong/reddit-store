Why live life on his terms if he won't meet you anywhere near halfway? \n\nI'd reevaluate this relationship, it doesn't seem that he is pulling his weight.", "NTA.  It's way past time that he join you for at-least some of your family holiday observances. I hope that you've started a new tradition of going only to your family's events until he starts to join you.\n\nOh yeah, no marriage until THIS gets settled. Compromise seems not to be in his vocabulary.  He needs some remediation on that area.", "NTA. Huge red flag. You have given up time with your family to be with his at holidays, and he has NEVER ONCE done the same for you? And clearly he could, but he doesn't care enough to, Apparently not even for you, and would rather prioritize video games over doing something for your sake? Not cool. To then expect YOU to be at his family events and getting all butthurt at you for saying you didn't want to come is just insanely hypocritical and messed up.  It sounds like your own family is important to you, and you value spending time with them- if he can't get on board and compromise with you so you are spending holidays with each family more equally, then I think you should consider reevaluating the relationship and if this is how you want things to be long term. \n\n\ni'm wondering if he acts this selfishly in other aspects of your relationship as well. I'm guessing yes.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is for not even trying to make an effort to be with your family on holidays when it obviously matters to you, and then getting upset when you act in the same manner he does. Saying he wants to stay up late to play video games and that's why he can't go is childish and immature. What does he expect when you get married? Just for you to always be with his family?", "NTA\n\n\"playing video games all night\" is not an excuse. \n\nYou put so much into the relationship. Seems like he is used to the relationship and refuses to put any effort in. Might be time to get a new boyfriend who appreciates you. \n\nNot sure if you are thinking marriage in the near future, but if he cannot even come to see your family, he is not the one.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being petty, you\u2019re waking up to the fact that you\u2019re putting more into the relationship than your BF does. \u201cToo busy playing video games\u201d to meet your family, that\u2019s just a garbage excuse. You need to figure out how many red flags it takes before you call foul.", "NTA. your boyfriend sounds like a spoilt child and you make too many sacrifices for him.", "NTA. He seems to think his family is the only thing that matters. Hell, first year of dating my husband and I made sure to split things equally between families because both sides are important. If he isn't even making a slight effort it won't change in time or after a wedding, in fact it'll probably get worse.", "NTA\n\nYou're allowed to spend a holiday with your family, and his refusal to even forgo a video game session to come with you pretty clearly establishes that his expectations are very \"Me Centric\"\n\nthe problem is you allowed this to go on too long and now it's become the expectation for him, it's past time to set your boundaries.", "NTA\n\nThis makes me kinda sad. You should be with someone that values your family as much as you value theirs. You should have a conversation with him about this and if he's only being defensive and not acknowledging your feelings, it's time to move on.", "He\u2019s being a selfish AH.

Know your worth and set expectations of what you want your future to look like.", "NTA, it\u2019s important to split up holiday time (or go separately). Do you see a future with this person?

Go find someone who treats you like an equal.\n\nIt\u2019s really telling that he gets so pissed when you do exactly what he\u2019s done to you for years. It shows he KNOWS how he treats you and yours is shit, he just doesn\u2019t care.", "NTA.  This isn't about being petty.  You've reached a breaking point.  You're finally noticing that you are willing to put in the effort into your relationship while your boyfriend is not.  It should give you pause to think about what you want out of this relationship.", "NTA, he does not like his own medicine. While it is a bit petty it is also called fed up. Why should you jump through hoops for him if he is not willing to do the same for you. Relationships are give and take. He needs to give more and take less. Truly he is selfish and petty and projecting on you. He is the AH, this one year he couldn't get up early for you or grace your family with his presence. Wow.", "NTA - relationships are all about compromising. It doesn't sound like he wants to do that. I know this was a big struggle with my husband and and I at first. (His parents are also together and mine are divorced) but we were able to work it out.", "This is your future.  Your children will be expected to spend all their holiday told with his family beside they are the only ones that are important.

Just because he says something doesn't actually make it so. For pity's sake, girl, just because this man who won't raise a finger for you SAYS WORDS does not make them the Ultimate and Incontrovertible Truth. \n\nAnd really, the important question here is not at all about you and your boyfriend's Thanksgiving at all. It's this: why on earth have you, a woman who seems lovely, sweet, thoughtful and generous, wasted MORE THAN HALF A DECADE OF YOUR LIFE on a man who literally WILL NOT MAKE EVEN THE TINIEST EFFORT to make you happy, doesn't care that it hurts you, and is completely open about that? \n\nGirl, he is so bloody rude that he told you that he literally will not wake up in the morning to do ONE NICE THING for you and have a holiday breakfast together, because he wants to \"stay up late and play video games\" - something he can do anytime, all year long, whenever. HE TOLD YOU TO YOUR FACE THAT VIDEO GAMES ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU ARE, after six years together. What more do you need to hear? \n\nHe. Does. Not. Give. One. Shit. About. You. \n\nHe told you so himself. So why are you making so much effort for him, over and over again? You are obviously NTA, but you're either so close to this situation or have lost so much of your sense of self-esteem that you're letting him treat you like dirt. You deserve so much better.

Holidays can be one of those times.  You are making reasonable requests that he is rejecting outright.  \n\nYou are right to make a stand.", "NTA and you are not being petty.

Yours isn't even trying, he doesn't seem like he cares about you and what you want. He only likes what he can get from you", "NTA, I have divorced parents and my husband\u2019s family. We rotate holidays or celebrate before/after the normal holiday. \n\nHe needs to learn to compromise.", "NTA - I would rethink the relationship.  Obviously, his needs/wants outweighs yours.", "NTA. He said he would rather play video games than go with you to your family things. That lets you know where his priorities are. He seems very selfish and immature. He's letting you know that what you want is not important to him, only what he wants.", "Nta \nEven my husband says is a butthead . Eventually he is going to try and make you bail on your family holidays", "Your boyfriend is trying to manipulate you into giving him his way AGAIN.  You've been far more accommodating than is healthy in a relationship.  NTA, but you need to figure out why you've given him his way since you were sixteen.", "He\u2019s being incredibly selfish and immature. Couples compromise for the holidays. That\u2019s normal. My SO and I are in town for the week of thanksgiving to see my family, and then for the week of Christmas we\u2019re visiting his family. We\u2019ll flip it next year.\n\nThe fact that you don\u2019t even have to go to a different state is even more ridiculous. He\u2019s saying video games are more important to him than your needs. You need to remind him that it\u2019s possible for him to lose you, and that being a crappy partner is a great way to ensure that will happen.", "This isn't even about divorce though? Even if you came from the \"perfect\" nuclear family, you'd still want to see them on holidays and he would not join you. So you'd have to choose between seeing him on holidays or seeing your family. That is not serious relationship material. He sounds selfish.", "WTF is his long term plan? If you guys get married and/or have kids? \n\nDoes he plan on making you miss your family events? Or splitting up? \n\nThe usual compromise is \u201cmy family get Christmas , yours gets thanksgiving and next year it switches\u201d. Dude is being hello selfish.", "OP it\u2019s not even the nuclear family thing.  It\u2019s he values his wants over yours.  He lacks empathy for you in this situation, because as long as he gets what he wants he\u2019s happy.  It might have to do with him having to grow up a little or maybe he\u2019s just too self centered to ever view any one else\u2019s need\u2019s besides his.  I bet if you look over the relationship this probably happens often.  Ex. two movies one you really want to watch and one he kinda wants to watch.  I bet you anything you end up watching his movie.  Things like that.  Relationships are about compromise, communication and caring.  He\u2019s not doing two of those now.", "His family is being insensitive to you and your family.", "I had a SO like this. In our 20's, we grew into different people.", "He didn't make ANY effort for six years, I find it hard to believe he would if you get married. And if he does, and that's a big if, it would be 1-2 hours and then back to his mummy to have dinner. Playing video games is such a pathetic excuse too.", "Beware. \n\n>his family just gives him tunnel vision and nothing else matters but them.>\n\nWhat's that going to look like when you have kids?\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "HE AND HIS BROTHER LIVE 15 MINUTES APART and he can\u2019t reschedule his damn gaming night to spend time with you and your family when it\u2019s obviously important to you??? I was seriously imagining that his brother lived across the country or internationally. This makes him sooo much more the AH. \n\nYou need to have a talk with him and tell him that you need a partner that prioritizes not just himself, but also the things important to you. And if he can\u2019t understand that and see his hypocrisy, you might need to reflect on if you really want to be with someone who is just going to break your heart and make you feel small and unvalued every holiday.", "He will continueto put parents first.

SIX years if him saying no, that's just rude at this point", "When his parents got married, did they not have to figure out to handle holidays with their own sets of parents? What is so hard for them to comprehend that people blend families and then form their own nuclear family with new traditions?", "My family is eating a little after 4, my boyfriend's family is eating at 6~.

If he can't ever compromise it's going to a shitty hell of a life. Break up fast like yesterday. 6 years is along time not go to your families holiday.  Also that is the most childish excuse ever. Play video games??? Also just because you can have kids does not mean you won't. Sometime people who think they can't do. Or they adopt you are only 22. Life happens. In any case this guy needs to man up and change or you need to leave. It's hard to leave boyfriends at that age but some men and women will never change. He might but he sounds very selfish and immature.", "NTA no offense but it seems like a one sided relationship", "NTA. I\u2019m wondering what other things your boyfriend isn\u2019t compromising on.", "NTA, but honestly I I think the real issue here is that you are saying that you perceive your relationship as significant, and are angry that he has spent years not wanting to get to know your family. Both he and you expect you to put in the effort and get to know his family, but the fact that he doesn't think he should have to put in the effort to getting to know yours tells you a lot about how he sees your relationship. You are supposed to fold up and become a part of his family and leave your whole family behind, if you don't want to do that, it sounds like this guy isn't someone to stay with forever if it's not something you can address in couples counseling. \n\nYeah just if you want to try and save this relationship- even though you shouldn't because it's doomed given that the person you're with does not respect you and you are not able to stand up for yourself with him- bring up couples counseling, if he doesn't go for it, then you need to accept that he's not going to put in the work to treat you the way you want. Then you need to break up with him and go to individual therapy, because the fact that you are so comfortable making excuses for him is a problem you should work through with a professional so that the next person you are with is someone you can spend the rest of your life with and who's going to treat you right", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vwyt9x/aita_for_pushing_my_boyfriend_after_i_told_him_to/\n\nthis your man?  Dump City, population: him.", "NTA but... a bit to yourself if you keep kidding yourself that things can go on like this. I think you need to face facts: he is never, ever going to bother prioritizing your family, even a tiny bit. He's all but told you that flat out. If you stay with him, you'll continue trying to make time for his family events, sometimes at the expense of your own, with no reciprocation. His little tantrum shows that he isn't interested in a compromise where you spend the holidays apart. He cares less about making you happy than he does avoiding the effort of rescheduling a video game all-nighter to later in the same week! When you tried to discuss the issue, he immediately flipped it around on you and claimed that YOU were the petty and immature one. Is this really a status quo you can keep living with? Is this really the relationship you want? \n\nSome of his behavior is really worrying- he may not be actively abusive, but reversing the situation to make himself the victim, distancing you from your family by keeping you from them at the holidays, and the tantrum at you refusing to comply with his whims are all steps toward emotional abuse, at the very least. If every year was like this, without change, with all the conflict and drama, how long could you stick it out before snapping? 5 more years of this? 10? The sunk cost fallacy of this relationship isn't going to get any better waiting longer, but your mental health and love for the holidays will definitely get worse. He basically told you he never intends to change- if he sticks to that, could you still see yourself doing this decades from now? Is it worth it?", "NTA BUT I do not see him compromising or giving anything to you. You can do better! Just because you have been with him for a long time does not mean you have to stay with him! You deserve a loving life partner!", "NTA. WOW, never attended any of your family\u2019s holidays? How rude. Too bad if he doesn\u2019t like that you won\u2019t be attending his holiday this year. It\u2019s high time you set some boundaries. And playing video games with his brother is an excuse for not going to breakfast? What is he - 10? Might want to have a think about where this relationship is going and how you want to live the rest of your life. Him making no sacrifices while you do it all or a life where you have a partner that shares life with you. Good luck. \ud83c\udf40", "NTA but seeing as y'all have been dating since 16/17, maybe it's time to take a good look at your relationship. Think about doing major \"family\" holidays like this for the next 6, 10, 20, 50 years. This is your future happiness. If you truly love him THAT much to forgo time with your relatives, then I wish you the best.", "Why are you with this AH? NTA", "NTA. This is definitely because of your ages.\n\nYou started dating when you were teenagers, at a time when it would be reasonable for your boyfriend and you to celebrate holidays separately.\n\nYou boyfriend hasn\u2019t moved out of his immediate family bubble mindset, and that\u2019s at least partially due to your ages. He initially didn\u2019t have to consider accommodating your family, and that\u2019s the lens through which he still sees your relationship. That\u2019s also the lens through which his parents see your relationship. They might love you, but they see you as his high school girlfriend. \n\nHe\u2019s not ready for the next step of seeing the two of you as the primary family unit in his life. He still wants his family traditions to dictate his schedule, which would be fine if he were younger or single. He\u2019s not, though. \n\nHe can be a good guy, but he\u2019s not ready to be a mature partner to someone.", "And chocolate and pineapple cake? Because clearly both are necessary!", "Even if you also lived in a perfect nuclear family, he is saying you will NEVER be able to spend holidays with your family.  He will not compromise, it\u2019s his way or the guilt-strewen highway.  You are looking at your life from here on in.\n\nYou might want to think this relationship through a little harder.  He doesn\u2019t care about your wants.", "My parents aren't divorced and I still go to multiple families for the holidays. Surely he understands that there's more to family than just parents and children. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, etc. Growing up there were so many people I visited.", "I don't think it's a \"perfect nuclear family\" issue. I come from one of those, and none of us would act the way he is. Being in a relationship means compromising, and spending some time with their family on some holidays. It's an issue because he's making it one, not because he fundamentally doesn't understand the concept or because of anything you're doing.", "this was my exact situation with my ex. His parents were still together, mine weren\u2019t. We were together for five years and he never came any of my family\u2019s holidays. In fact, there were several times where he would be like \u201cwe need to start spending some holidays together because my parents keep asking me questions about it.\u201d I went a couple times to his family\u2019s holidays and usually at least made a stop at his parents place if I couldn\u2019t stay for a meal. So, when he would say that I would say he\u2019s more than welcome to come to mine but nope. I had to put more effort into his family on the holidays and his parents saw it that way too. Interesting, isn\u2019t it? On the flip side, I\u2019ve been dating someone for three weeks and without any hesitation at all, accepted my invitation to my family\u2019s thanksgiving. \n\nIt\u2019s a two way street. Relationships are two way streets. You can\u2019t always be the one compromising.", "Is this the guy who wouldn\u2019t stop touching you in another post? Are we sure he\u2019s a great guy, or is he the guy you fell for at 16 and you can\u2019t imagine anyone else treating you better because this is all you\u2019ve ever known?\n\nI\u2019ve been there. Maybe I\u2019m wrong about your relationship, but consider this as a possible favor to yourself: don\u2019t go to his family for the holidays. Don\u2019t have him come over to yours. And honestly, aside from maybe a good morning and good night call/text, don\u2019t talk to him; have your phone off. See how you feel without him hanging over you for a few days\u2026and if the feeling is relief, maybe consider what that means. \n\nI \u201ctook a break\u201d from my high school sweetheart in college for my own mental health, and after the day or two of hysterical crying and thinking I wouldn\u2019t be able to survive without seeing him every day, I was so much happier.", "Oh please don't make excuses for him, he's not being stupid, he knows what he's doing. Don't be fooled, he just doesn't care", "Try is him just saying a word to get you off his back cuz given that you stayed with him for 6 years, he knows that will work. This isn't a try situation, it's something he should have already been doing years ago, and the fact that he's telling you he's not going to this year, is your sign to leave", "My parents haven't met my girlfriend yet.  I asked if she could come to Thanksgiving this year and they said no, and reminded me that my dad is having surgery next week. \n\nTotally fair, I forgot that they are trying to keep a minimum amount of visitors around him before his surgery.  So Im spending Friday with her instead. \n\nIs this really the hill (or argument moreso) that he wants to make it into?   He's never spent a single holiday with your family and expects you to drop everything to spend every holiday with his family?\n\nWhat are you guys going to do if you get married? I saw your edit about not being able to have kids.  I'm sorry people have been assholes about that.  I'm not able to either, so I get that.  But even still, once you're married (if you choose to), you still will have to make adjustments to your holiday schedule.\n\nNo reasonable partner would make you miss out on holidays with your family for the rest of your life, or at least they shouldn't.", "Yeah this is what hits me, like he went out shopping and found the perfect person to put up with his bullshit. These post scare the hell out of me cuz I know no I've done the exact same thing and this could have been me thinking my whole life into someone and making excuses for them treating me wrong", "Not to mention that he 'can't' go to breakfast because he's video-gaming with his brothers.\n\nI have to agree with you... not a relationship worth pursuing long term.\n\nNTA"]}
