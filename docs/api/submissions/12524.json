My wife and I have 3 daughters, 27, 25, and 18. Our oldest two are ours biologically, and we adopted our youngest at age 7 after my sister passed. My in-laws were pretty comfortable financially and set up college savings accounts for our oldest two daughters when they were born. My  parents and her mother and I contributed to these accounts as well, but mainly my wife\u2019s parents.  The problem is that my wife\u2019s parents passed before we adopted our youngest daughter, and therefore they did not set up a fund for her. My wife and I created one for her when we adopted her, but with less time and without my in-laws\u2019 help. \n\nWhen our oldest daughter went to college, she was able to cover 3 years of her education and took out loans for the remaining year. With our second daughter, she went to community college before transferring to a state school so her savings covered it, but ended up taking loans out towards her graduate degree a few years later. My wife and I have not signed on to any of our children\u2019s loans and have not paid for them. We told our girls that we would only be able to supplement their education from the beginning so it wasn\u2019t a shock.  \n\nHowever, now that it is my youngest daughter\u2019s turn to go to college, her savings will only cover a year of school, maybe 3 semesters. Recently she asked us about loans and it seemed she was implying we would take them out. We let her know that wasn\u2019t the case, and she confirmed our suspicions by getting angry at us and saying it wasn\u2019t fair she would have to pay so much more than her siblings. \n\nWe seem to be at a standstill now, with her refusing to speak to us unless we agree to take out at least part of what she needs, and us refusing. Are we TA here?\n\nEdit: Fixing grammar mistakes\n\nEdit: Someone mentioned to add this. The oldest two had roughly 40k in their accounts and our youngest has 25k. Both of our oldest daughters went to our state school which was only around 12k/yr, and our youngest is going to a private school that costs around 18k a year.", "created_utc": 1679069786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tvndj/aita_for_not_taking_out_loans_for_my_daughters/", "score": 882, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, the world is full of people who don't have the money to do what they want.  It sucks that a college is so oppressively expensive, but there are lower cost alternatives.\n\nI had to take out loans, couldn't join a frat, had to work, etc.  It blows.  Having rich parents would be nice, but not all of us are so blessed.\n\nI think it's reasonable for you to help some if you can.  Provide housing, food, etc. if possible.  There are options.", "NTA\n\nI don't get why people are saying you are being unfair. She may have less money but she also choose a different route- you said your middle went to community college first and saved then took a loan. Both of your own kids took loans, so yes the younger one may have to also. I get that it's not fair- but life isn't always fair, and she lost her parents and grandparents so of course she will not have the same footing. If she went to a cheaper school she'd have more semesters covered. i'd honestly help her look for scholarships and tell her to apply for a federal loan with low interest.", "NTA, though I seem to be in the minority.  I see other suggest the money should have been split three ways but I disagree, how would that be fair to your 2 older children? You couldn't take money from accounts in their names, thar would make you an asshole.\n\nI assume your sister passed away, didn't leave money to raise her child, whom you have adopted and treated as your own? You had 7 years less to save and less help through no fault of your own.  I honestly don't see how you can be called an asshole here.  Is it unfortunate? Yes but you absolutely aren't an asshole, though you seem to have raised one", "Question: since her mom died when she was 7, did she inherit anything from her?", "NAH. \n\nFrom your comments it looks like you didn\u2019t really have enough time to save for the youngest child before she was in college. As you said the majority of the money for the other two was paid for by the grandparents so it\u2019s not like you are in a good enough financial place to fund the youngest\u2019s college.\n\nAt the same time, your youngest has every right to be upset. Being adopted is hard and when there\u2019s any type of unequal treatment it\u2019s hard not to look at the through lens of being adopted. She likely expected not to have to worry too much about college tuition until closer to the end of her schooling.\n\nWhat it comes down to for me is the difference between preplanned savings and student loans. Taking on debt for the youngest is not in the same realm as grandparents putting away money for the older two children. I still think the situation is unfair but things like this can happen in mixed families.", "Ok, minority vote, but NTA. \n\nNothing you\u2019ve written here shows an AH move on your or your wife\u2019s part. Sometimes life isn\u2019t fair. If she was your bio kid and you had her after your wife\u2019s parents passed away, you also wouldn\u2019t have had additional money saved in a 529. There are ways she can reduce how much she pays (like what your second daughter did) and it sounds like you\u2019ve been honest with her from the get-go about what you have saved. She can get scholarships, work, and get loans. Honestly, it sounds like you\u2019re treating her exactly how you treated your other kids.\n\nSit down with her to talk. Listen to her feelings. Be nice. Remind her that you love her, and offer to help draft a plan for her to be the most stable she can financially.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. The situations are completely different for how money was allocated for your first two, vs. your third. \n\nSure, it\u2019s not \u201cfair,\u201d but neither was your in-laws passing away before she was adopted. You guys aren\u2019t choosing to neglect her, the situation just  doesn\u2019t allow for you to help her.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex situation, and obviously feelings are hurt, but there\u2019s nothing that can really be done.

Plus lots of local organizations have scholarships.  Have her contact her guidance counselor and the financial aid office at her potential colleges.", "NTA. I think most people here are glossing over the fact that she was adopted after her mother passed. Her adoption doesn\u2019t seem like it was planned and it looks like you did the best you could in order to set up her college fund but circumstances were just not favorable and this is the result. It\u2019s not fair but it\u2019s not really anyones fault either.", "NTA.\n\nYour older two got a huge benefit from their very generous bio grandparents. That was a wonderful gift that they received.\n\nYour youngest unfortunately did not receive such a gift. I can see why she's a bit jealous, but they were not her grandparents (biologically or through adoption), she really can't expect anything from them.\n\nI feel badly for your youngest, to be sure, but she her demands that you give her something to match a third party's gift is completely unreasonable. She's got a lot of maturing to do.", "ESH \n\nYoungest daughter is completely justified in being upset at the *de facto* unequal treatment, regardless of circumstances. How could she NOT view this through the lens of being adopted? But her immature reaction makes her partially TA.\n\nOP is also at fault, mainly for not communicating the situation to youngest daughter long before the college search process.", "NTA.\n\nYou saved up as much as you could for your 3 daughters. The fact that it was less for your youngest daughter sucks, but it was nothing you could control.", "NTA\n\nI see alot of Y T A comments saying that the moment he adopted the youngest, he should have split accumulated college savings for the oldest 2 daughters 3 ways. But most of the money saved for college for the oldest 2 was provided by their grandparents, who were not related to the youngest adopted daughter, and had already passed. It would have been unfair to split up the money that the older children's grandparents left specifically for them. \n\nI think OP did the best they could with an unfortunate situation. They still set up a college fund and saved for the youngest after they adopted her.  Covering 3 semesters is much more than alot of people get. Loans are not the end of the world. Most people have them, unfortunately.\n\nThe youngest will have to be aware of the funds available to her and make a choice to either go to her top choice college and get loans, or go to community college to avoid it.", "NTA. But you should be understanding that your youngest daughter is upset. Make sure to fully explain the situation and that the money just isn\u2019t there. Student loans exist for a reason and while they can suck, for many, many people they are the only option. \n\nYou are at the age of retirement and it was very good of you to adopt her. The situation is what it is.", "NTA for not taking out loans\n\nBut why did you let your youngest apply and commit to a private school at 18K a year?  Students can take out a total of about 30K in federal loans over 4 years.  As a parent, you should have been very upfront about this during the college search.  Because the only reasonable path in this case is probably CC and a transfer path.\n\nI am assuming this is March of her senior year?  If that is the case, you are the AH for not setting the tone for a college search a couple years earlier.  Because she is not going to be able to attend this school for 18K a year in all liklihood.  Top choice or not.\n\n(parent of senior, sometime college admissions counselor)", "INFO: What kind of financial difference are we talking about between what you gave your two oldest and what you gave your youngest?

The asshole here is the American post-graduate education system, not you. You couldn\u2019t control gifts given to the oldest from your in-laws and it would\u2019ve been unfair to take their money away to pay for your younger. This is just a very specific case of sometimes life sucks and is unfair.", "NTA - you try to do your best. Someone here alluded to her being either your daughter or your niece, that's nonsense. You adopted her and seem to see her as your daughter now, but prior to that she was your niece. Is there any sort of state funding / bursary she can apply for? Could she get a job to supplement? You couldn't pool the 2 funds for your other daughters, they would have hated and resented her for that. Good luck, hope it's resolved and well done for your efforts.", "The US Education system is the asshole here.", "NTA, your other daughters didn\u2019t get all of their college paid for by the accounts set up by your in-laws. It paid for some and then they took out the loans for the rest. You\u2019ve told her it would only cover some of her college, the first year since it\u2019s an expensive school. She has to cover the rest. Tuition increases every year with these schools, so whatever money you have isn\u2019t going to stretch like it did before. She needs to understand this, but she\u2019s acting childish, and entitled. If it\u2019s too expensive for her to take the loans out, then maybe she should consider community college like her sister. You would be the AH to you and your wife if you took out the loans. Think of your future, retirement is coming.", "Unpopular NTA opinion here. This is reality, sometimes life isn\u2019t fair and it\u2019s not like this is purposeful. \nFor reference: My parents took great care of me but were unable to fully fund my education (they paid for 3 semesters of community college and one year of university before I took out my own loans, seems like your daughter could copy something like this with the money saved). I don\u2019t know what your daughter is wanting to do but as long as she selects her university and degree wisely she will be fine without extra help. If her selected degree might not lead to a safe career then it would be rough regardless.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've put away what you could.  Also, college is more expensive than it was even 5 years ago. \n\nCan your youngest go to the local community college, live at home (at no charge) and work part time to get her AA, then go on to a 4-year college to finish?  If so, can you assist some?  That will stretch the funds.", "NTA You had seven less years to invest money, and two less people to help contribute! Of course there's less money! Also I'm assuming there was less money in middle daughters fund than older daughters fund because the way you describe the community college thing... And the in-law is dying would mean there be two less years payments in middle fund... But she made it work by going to community college to stretch her money which youngest is not willing to do! \n\nAll these people in here saying that you should have invested more in the youngest since she had less don't seem to understand that's not fair to your older 2! You're literally in a situation where nobody wins! If you would give more to the youngest then the oldest would be mad because you gave more to the youngest. Now the youngest is mad because people that are no longer alive donated to the oldest two college funds. You literally can't win!", "INFO: Did you adjust whatever money you were putting in your bio daughters accounts (if you were contributing) after you adopted your daughter in order to try to make up the difference?\n\nETA: Also, did you make sure your daughter was aware of the discrepancy over the last several years?", "INFO: Can you afford to help out your daughter or are you strapped?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She shouldn\u2019t be taking her anger out on you, but she is young and it\u2019s a crappy situation.

Did you help her seek out partial/full scholarships to help with her tuition?  \n\nLook, at the end of the day, it sounds like your decision has been made.  Just keep in mind she may hold this against you by being treated differently.  The facts will mean nothing to her.  In the meantime, I would strongly recommend looking for financial aid.  Also, see if her college of choice will allow her to take a year off so she can go to a community college to take the prerequisite courses at a cheaper price and then transfers.\n\nGood luck.", "It's an unfortunate situation... but NTA.\n\nGranted that these funds have existed for a long time, but unfortunately it sounds like your older daughters benefited from the circumstance of having this planned out by you and your wifes parents decades ago, whereas your adopted daugher came into the picture much later and likely wasn't planned for, based on your post.\n\nIt's unfair and unfortunate but... that doesn't make you an asshole. Also, realize that a lot of the asshole comments are coming from typical redditors who think that money grows on trees and you should just pick some extra money from the money tree so your youngest daughter can have a bigger fund.\n\nSide note: nothing wrong with starting out at community college. Getting two years of classes out of the way for cheap is probably a good idea because then that fund can have two more years to grow AND your daughter would need less time at the expensive school.", "NTA at all. The Y.T.A in this thread are ridiculous and are acting like you can just make money appear. With your youngest you had 7 fewer years to save, & didn't have the largest contributors able to contribute. Even with that you still managed to save enough to cover a year of college. That's more than most get and while I definitely feel bad that she doesn't have the same standing as her sisters she has to realize her circumstances are different.", "NTA \n\nConsidering it\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for any of your kid\u2019s college fees, you not putting yourself in debt for your youngest makes complete sense.

This is coming from someone who 1. Is a parent and 2. Paid her own way thru school", "NTA.\n\nYou are making the correct financial decision for both her and you. If you take out loans, you will not get the benefits she will for educational purposes (ie income based deferments or minimum payments, and potential forgiveness all together). Nor should you co-sign the loans. You should have her take out the loans then you can help her pay them off in other ways.", "NTA. I would suggest encouraging her to stay home and get her AA first- which you could likely pay for out of pocket for her (most schools offer monthly payment plans- I paid off my AA on my own this way). Then she can transfer, use her college fund for the first bit then take out her own loans for the rest like her sisters did. Or contribute what you would spend on her AA in addition to her college fund, but make sure she is aware that it will not go as far at a university and that she is responsible for the difference.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t supplement the other girls- the sad reality is they just had more savings to work with. If you want to delve it being \u201cfair\u201d try to supply the exact amounts the other girls had but that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t take out loans- if she wants school that should be in her. Personally college is a waste of money these days unless you\u2019re going in to a sure fire degree", "NTA. Am I the only one who noticed that the school accounts were set up by his wife\u2019s parents? The third child is not related to them in anyway. Now I would hope that had her parents still been living they would have set up an account for the last daughter but it also would not be out of line if they didn\u2019t. I do think it would be a gesture of good will to offer to pay for her associates at the community college if you are able. However if you are not then that is just how the dice fell. Does it stink? Yep and please please acknowledge it to her that it does stink and it isn\u2019t fair but there is only x you can do to change that. At the end of day a future employer isn\u2019t going to care where she got her degree so the onus is on her to decide if four years at her top choice is worth the long term cost.", "No judgement, because I feel for the kid and I know you guys provided what you could. I think this might not just be about the loans. I think she feels \"Othered\" from the other children. Her bio mom died and she was thankfully adopted by you guys. She should know that the money is from the grandparents for her other siblings.\n\nTBH looking into Scholarships would have been a great way to find funds. She was adopted, there are some scholarships for this. I guess it's not up to the parents for this, but i think it would have been great to try to find scholarships with her to accommodate those funds. It may not be too late to look into this. You post doesn't show anything about that. There might even be movement assistance in that department as well?\n\nbut I really think she is using this as if she wasn't loved maybe? That could be it, I don't mean to put any words in anyone's mouth. But have you talked about if this isn't really about the money?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIDK but she's lucky to have someone save money for her to go to school. Most kids don't get one these days.

It's just that seems like a lot of money was saved.", "NTA --- Sure, it's not fair. Life isn't fair. My parents were very decent people, but I got NOTHING for college except a 10 year old Studebaker. That was it.

I do not think you should pay your daughters college in full, as you didn\u2019t for her sisters. It\u2019s also not your fault that your in laws contributions were no longer available. There is some hard reality here.\n\nWas anything left to her when your sister passed? \n\nPerhaps a compromise would be to continue making the contributions to her education that you would have made for the 7 years she wasn\u2019t with you?

Your youngest needs a bit more help than the other two so is it feasible perhaps think about it? Both financially and also fine with the sisters?", "The first year is usually the hardest financially. Talk to the college financial aid office about opportunities that might open up in year two, for example being a resident advisor in the dorms while highly competitive l, may come with a tuition waiver and free room and board or there might be departmental scholarships.  \n\nWhether long term it\u2019s better to go to community college than a local school depends a lot on what school she\u2019s targeting and what her major is.  For children from low income families, the networking and other opportunities at a top ranked school can make a big difference in lifelong earnings.  On the other hand, for STEM majors, the reputation of the graduate school makes a lot more difference than undergrad.", "Why does she need to go to a private school? Would a regular college not suffice?", "The ass hole in this scenario is a system that does not invest in the future of our young people but insuring that higher education is affordable.", "Let me give some advice as someone who went to a private college and took out loans. \n\nDO NOT DO IT.\n\nI will always treasure my time there and what I learned but it was not worth being $100,000 total in debt. I have all that debt, with over half my tuition covered with scholarships and grants, but can't even think of getting a mortgage or living alone because of this. She also doesn't know this yet, but private school costs increase very quickly over the years and she could be paying up to $2000 more each year. Private college is not feasible for low/middle income families without scholarships from that same college.

In the next few years you have one more kid. Now flash forward to when the kids get old enough to get their trust fund. Does that mean you should steal part of the inheritance from the older two to give some to the young one that wasn't born when the inheritance was handed out?

These were the grandparents that wouldn't have been related to her. We would like to think that an adoption would make them feel like it's just as much their granddaughter but we don't know... This is AITA where we are always seeing people not feel the same way about adopted or step kids.\n\nAlso agree that grad school is different, but the one that took the money out for grad school is the one that went to community college...

SERIOUSLY?? I wonder if she's not talking to her parents", "^ It\u2019s not a sunshine and roses kind of thing to say, but it\u2019s not a damnable aspect to the situation that they, in fact, hadn\u2019t planning on a third kid.

They were both still finishing school and trying to establish themselves financially. We lived with my grandparents until I was 6. They had about 40k saved up for me by the time I was college age. \n\nMy sister is 13 years younger than me.

Kids and their damn  dream school\" narratives is exactly why they can't afford to move out after college or live to thwir potential.  \n\nSadly, the family has done what they needed to raise 3 wonderful kids who have options and abilities that they must weigh.", "Eh, it sounds like she wants to go to a \u201cdream school.\u201d So three semesters worth of money might not be a negligible amount.", "It is possible but it\u2019s unrealistic. I didn\u2019t say you can\u2019t talk to a 14 and 16 year old but how do you redistribute or change 14-16 years of contributions, especially contributions from family members who are no longer alive and have no relation to the child in question?\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t whether it was possible, the issue is in the treatment of everyone all around.\n\nYou want to please one by potentially upsetting others.\n\nAnd doing the math, the 2 oldest got 40 and 25, mainly coming from the in laws while the youngest got 20k or so all coming from the parents and with 7 years less. So with that information now\u2026 there\u2019s not really anything else to be said.", "yep. you think she should be grateful for being adopted.  If she was a bio child, you wouldn't be bringing up that foster homes are where the real suffering is.  YOu think it's fair for  her because she's adopted.  If that's the case OP is TA.", "When you adopted her, she became your daughter, not your niece. \n\nIs this perhaps why you aren't willing to treat her fairly? Do you resent having to take her in so she wouldn't end up in foster care?", "I know, it\u2019s absolutely insane! Just the other day there was a guy whose older kids had started to move out and he wanted to ask his girlfriend to move in with her young child.

There\u2019s a definite hierarchy on these posts. 16-25 year olds and anyone who\u2019s vehemently child-free always seem to come out on top.

Nta for me.\n\nYou can't turn yourself into money and a third child aged 7 was a big and unexpected expense. The most you could do is take a loan for the 15k, not the full amount.", "Yes I understand that part. He cannot get grandparent contributions.\n\nI am just telling that any behavior short of paying for the school will create lifetime resentment and she will not talk with him. If he loves money more than his daughter, he can go ahead and not sign anything.", "Right? I don't get the it was unfair she got less of an inheritance bc you had to unexpectedly take in a 3rd child you didn't plan for and raised them the best you could.\n\n Life isn't fair and we all do the best we can. Which it sounds like OP did. She has some money for school and she can decide if she wants loans or a cheaper school. Or a scholarship. Why aren't scholarships mentioned?\n\nNTA. Don't go into debt. You need to take care of you too.", "Exactly.  OP said their older daughters both went to state schools which cost about $12k back then.  It's obviously going to be more now, but even so.  That $25k the youngest has would easily cover a full year and maybe a little more at the same school her sisters attended.  Sometimes a dream school is just that--a dream.", "It\u2019s still maybe nothing compared to her sisters.\n\nOP mentions she got less because an inheritance before she was adopted - but everything since? \n\nThey knew her sisters had a bigger inherited fund, and still out more there than for her. She\u2019s adopted and she\u2019s his niece - she doesn\u2019t have other grandparents but OPs parents. They knowingly didn\u2019t plan for her future within the limited support she had. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s negligible imho\n\nI get most people would be grateful for her leg up, and US education costs im sure it\u2019s a lot. It doesn\u2019t change what she would\u2019ve fairly gotten in HER family.", "She was orphaned. This isn't some do-gooders ripping a baby from a poor teenage mom and expecting her to be grateful for scraps; this is a situation where it was either a family adoption or fostercare.  \n\nIf she had gone to a foster family who eventually adopted her but never paid for college for any of the kids, would that be a better outcome than being with her own family and having a year of college paid for? Since OP can't jump into a time machine and set up a third fund seven years in advance with comparable contributions form the grandparents, are they supposed to destroy their nest egg and ensure that they will burden all of the kids with their retirement just so one can go to her first-choice college without paying a dime?", "If she has any sense she should because her alternative life would\u2019ve been being in the system. Pretty sure that her adoptive parents saving for her without the help of the maternal grandparents is a better option than being passed around people\u2019s home. But you need to be right despite being so wrong so go ahead.", "Can you please just stop with the \u201cshe\u2019s not your niece\u201d crap already? She was seven when her mother died. She knew her mother for more than a third of her life and most likely still remembers much of her. She is OPs niece *as well* as his daughter. Brushing that aside is like trying to wipe out the memory of her mother. \n\nOP was perfectly reasonable in the way he framed it, and you also don\u2019t know how his daughter/niece feels. Also, he has only used the word \u201cniece\u201d once and that was to clarify why it was so important that they adopted her. Every single other time in his post, he referred to her as \u201cdaughter\u201d\n\nMy friend was adopted in similar circumstances and hated it when her parents weren\u2019t given any recognition of their rightful place.", "I called her my niece in case it was unclear that we had adopted her from family rather than an agency. She is absolutely our daughter and i resent the implication that we feel she isn\u2019t.", "Christ, you\u2019re saying a lot for not having an adopted child in sight?

The others got more money due to a different source than her.", "You\u2019ve made it very clear she\u2019s adopted.", "Except you don't treat her like your real daughter. When asked why you didn't try to balance out the education accounts when you had the chance, you said:\n\n\"Our oldest was already in college and our second was in her senior year when she was adopted. If we had pulled the rug out from under them on top of the adoption, they would have hated us.\"\n\nThe worry here wasn't making things fair to your youngest daughter but prioritizing your bio-daughters' feelings about your youngest being adopted. When asked why you adopted your niece (implied  if you're going to treat her differently), you then said:\n\n\"because she's my niece and I didn't want her in foster care?\" \n\nIt sounds like you adopted your niece out of duty rather than because you wanted to, and that your niece should just be grateful you adopted her regardless of how you treat her relative to your bio daughters. You may not see it, but you do seem to treat your niece differently than your bio daughters. It does seem like she's your adopted niece rather than your daughter...and there is a difference.", "But you aren\u2019t giving her the same start as your daughters so it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion that you see them differently because you are treating them differently.", "It's obviously an important detail to this story, so of course he made it clear.", "But he isn't treating her differently. He saved up roughly 25k for her alone without help. His other two daughters had roughly 40k saved with their maternal grandparents' money + OP. He did not take out loans for his other daughters. They took out loans on their own to cover what wasn't. OP could not steal money from his other two daughters to make the college funds the same. Especially when his oldest was already using her college fund for almost three years when the youngest was adopted."]}
