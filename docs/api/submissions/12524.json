My wife and I have 3 daughters, 27, 25, and 18. Our oldest two are ours biologically, and we adopted our youngest at age 7 after my sister passed. My in-laws were pretty comfortable financially and set up college savings accounts for our oldest two daughters when they were born. My  parents and her mother and I contributed to these accounts as well, but mainly my wife\u2019s parents.  The problem is that my wife\u2019s parents passed before we adopted our youngest daughter, and therefore they did not set up a fund for her. My wife and I created one for her when we adopted her, but with less time and without my in-laws\u2019 help. \n\nWhen our oldest daughter went to college, she was able to cover 3 years of her education and took out loans for the remaining year. With our second daughter, she went to community college before transferring to a state school so her savings covered it, but ended up taking loans out towards her graduate degree a few years later. My wife and I have not signed on to any of our children\u2019s loans and have not paid for them. We told our girls that we would only be able to supplement their education from the beginning so it wasn\u2019t a shock.  \n\nHowever, now that it is my youngest daughter\u2019s turn to go to college, her savings will only cover a year of school, maybe 3 semesters. Recently she asked us about loans and it seemed she was implying we would take them out. We let her know that wasn\u2019t the case, and she confirmed our suspicions by getting angry at us and saying it wasn\u2019t fair she would have to pay so much more than her siblings. \n\nWe seem to be at a standstill now, with her refusing to speak to us unless we agree to take out at least part of what she needs, and us refusing. Are we TA here?\n\nEdit: Fixing grammar mistakes\n\nEdit: Someone mentioned to add this. The oldest two had roughly 40k in their accounts and our youngest has 25k. Both of our oldest daughters went to our state school which was only around 12k/yr, and our youngest is going to a private school that costs around 18k a year.", "created_utc": 1679069786, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11tvndj/aita_for_not_taking_out_loans_for_my_daughters/", "score": 5902, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, the world is full of people who don't have the money to do what they want.  It sucks that a college is so oppressively expensive, but there are lower cost alternatives.\n\nI had to take out loans, couldn't join a frat, had to work, etc.  It blows.  Having rich parents would be nice, but not all of us are so blessed.\n\nI think it's reasonable for you to help some if you can.  Provide housing, food, etc. if possible.  There are options.", "NTA\n\nI don't get why people are saying you are being unfair. She may have less money but she also choose a different route- you said your middle went to community college first and saved then took a loan. Both of your own kids took loans, so yes the younger one may have to also. I get that it's not fair- but life isn't always fair, and she lost her parents and grandparents so of course she will not have the same footing. If she went to a cheaper school she'd have more semesters covered. i'd honestly help her look for scholarships and tell her to apply for a federal loan with low interest.", "NTA, though I seem to be in the minority.  I see other suggest the money should have been split three ways but I disagree, how would that be fair to your 2 older children? You couldn't take money from accounts in their names, thar would make you an asshole.\n\nI assume your sister passed away, didn't leave money to raise her child, whom you have adopted and treated as your own? You had 7 years less to save and less help through no fault of your own.  I honestly don't see how you can be called an asshole here.  Is it unfortunate? Yes but you absolutely aren't an asshole, though you seem to have raised one", "Question: since her mom died when she was 7, did she inherit anything from her?", "NAH. \n\nFrom your comments it looks like you didn\u2019t really have enough time to save for the youngest child before she was in college. As you said the majority of the money for the other two was paid for by the grandparents so it\u2019s not like you are in a good enough financial place to fund the youngest\u2019s college.\n\nAt the same time, your youngest has every right to be upset. Being adopted is hard and when there\u2019s any type of unequal treatment it\u2019s hard not to look at the through lens of being adopted. She likely expected not to have to worry too much about college tuition until closer to the end of her schooling.\n\nWhat it comes down to for me is the difference between preplanned savings and student loans. Taking on debt for the youngest is not in the same realm as grandparents putting away money for the older two children. I still think the situation is unfair but things like this can happen in mixed families.", "Ok, minority vote, but NTA. \n\nNothing you\u2019ve written here shows an AH move on your or your wife\u2019s part. Sometimes life isn\u2019t fair. If she was your bio kid and you had her after your wife\u2019s parents passed away, you also wouldn\u2019t have had additional money saved in a 529. There are ways she can reduce how much she pays (like what your second daughter did) and it sounds like you\u2019ve been honest with her from the get-go about what you have saved. She can get scholarships, work, and get loans. Honestly, it sounds like you\u2019re treating her exactly how you treated your other kids.\n\nSit down with her to talk. Listen to her feelings. Be nice. Remind her that you love her, and offer to help draft a plan for her to be the most stable she can financially.", "Going against the grain and saying NTA. The situations are completely different for how money was allocated for your first two, vs. your third. \n\nSure, it\u2019s not \u201cfair,\u201d but neither was your in-laws passing away before she was adopted. You guys aren\u2019t choosing to neglect her, the situation just  doesn\u2019t allow for you to help her.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex situation, and obviously feelings are hurt, but there\u2019s nothing that can really be done.

My experience in higher education showed me that most schools especially private pricey ones have a ton of scholarships that go begging for good candidates.  Plus lots of local organizations have scholarships.  Have her contact her guidance counselor and the financial aid office at her potential colleges.", "NTA. I think most people here are glossing over the fact that she was adopted after her mother passed. Her adoption doesn\u2019t seem like it was planned and it looks like you did the best you could in order to set up her college fund but circumstances were just not favorable and this is the result. It\u2019s not fair but it\u2019s not really anyones fault either.", "NTA.\n\nYour older two got a huge benefit from their very generous bio grandparents. That was a wonderful gift that they received.\n\nYour youngest unfortunately did not receive such a gift. I can see why she's a bit jealous, but they were not her grandparents (biologically or through adoption), she really can't expect anything from them.\n\nI feel badly for your youngest, to be sure, but she her demands that you give her something to match a third party's gift is completely unreasonable. She's got a lot of maturing to do.", "ESH \n\nYoungest daughter is completely justified in being upset at the *de facto* unequal treatment, regardless of circumstances. How could she NOT view this through the lens of being adopted? But her immature reaction makes her partially TA.\n\nOP is also at fault, mainly for not communicating the situation to youngest daughter long before the college search process.", "NTA.\n\nYou saved up as much as you could for your 3 daughters. The fact that it was less for your youngest daughter sucks, but it was nothing you could control.", "NTA\n\nI see alot of Y T A comments saying that the moment he adopted the youngest, he should have split accumulated college savings for the oldest 2 daughters 3 ways. But most of the money saved for college for the oldest 2 was provided by their grandparents, who were not related to the youngest adopted daughter, and had already passed. It would have been unfair to split up the money that the older children's grandparents left specifically for them. \n\nI think OP did the best they could with an unfortunate situation. They still set up a college fund and saved for the youngest after they adopted her.  Covering 3 semesters is much more than alot of people get. Loans are not the end of the world. Most people have them, unfortunately.\n\nThe youngest will have to be aware of the funds available to her and make a choice to either go to her top choice college and get loans, or go to community college to avoid it.", "NTA. But you should be understanding that your youngest daughter is upset. Make sure to fully explain the situation and that the money just isn\u2019t there. Student loans exist for a reason and while they can suck, for many, many people they are the only option. \n\nYou are at the age of retirement and it was very good of you to adopt her. The situation is what it is.", "NTA for not taking out loans\n\nBut why did you let your youngest apply and commit to a private school at 18K a year?  Students can take out a total of about 30K in federal loans over 4 years.  As a parent, you should have been very upfront about this during the college search.  Because the only reasonable path in this case is probably CC and a transfer path.\n\nI am assuming this is March of her senior year?  If that is the case, you are the AH for not setting the tone for a college search a couple years earlier.  Because she is not going to be able to attend this school for 18K a year in all liklihood.  Top choice or not.\n\n(parent of senior, sometime college admissions counselor)", "INFO: What kind of financial difference are we talking about between what you gave your two oldest and what you gave your youngest? Is she going to pay back more because she picked a more expensive school, or because school costs have gone up, or did you give your older kids twice as much as your youngest?", "Info: how much money did you put in to each of the kids accounts?", "NTA. The asshole here is the American post-graduate education system, not you. You couldn\u2019t control gifts given to the oldest from your in-laws and it would\u2019ve been unfair to take their money away to pay for your younger. This is just a very specific case of sometimes life sucks and is unfair.", "NTA - you try to do your best. Someone here alluded to her being either your daughter or your niece, that's nonsense. You adopted her and seem to see her as your daughter now, but prior to that she was your niece. Is there any sort of state funding / bursary she can apply for? Could she get a job to supplement? You couldn't pool the 2 funds for your other daughters, they would have hated and resented her for that. Good luck, hope it's resolved and well done for your efforts.", "The US Education system is the asshole here.", "NTA, your other daughters didn\u2019t get all of their college paid for by the accounts set up by your in-laws. It paid for some and then they took out the loans for the rest. You\u2019ve told her it would only cover some of her college, the first year since it\u2019s an expensive school. She has to cover the rest. Tuition increases every year with these schools, so whatever money you have isn\u2019t going to stretch like it did before. She needs to understand this, but she\u2019s acting childish, and entitled. If it\u2019s too expensive for her to take the loans out, then maybe she should consider community college like her sister. You would be the AH to you and your wife if you took out the loans. Think of your future, retirement is coming.", "Unpopular NTA opinion here. This is reality, sometimes life isn\u2019t fair and it\u2019s not like this is purposeful. \nFor reference: My parents took great care of me but were unable to fully fund my education (they paid for 3 semesters of community college and one year of university before I took out my own loans, seems like your daughter could copy something like this with the money saved). I don\u2019t know what your daughter is wanting to do but as long as she selects her university and degree wisely she will be fine without extra help. If her selected degree might not lead to a safe career then it would be rough regardless.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've put away what you could.  Also, college is more expensive than it was even 5 years ago. \n\nCan your youngest go to the local community college, live at home (at no charge) and work part time to get her AA, then go on to a 4-year college to finish?  If so, can you assist some?  That will stretch the funds.", "NTA You had seven less years to invest money, and two less people to help contribute! Of course there's less money! Also I'm assuming there was less money in middle daughters fund than older daughters fund because the way you describe the community college thing... And the in-law is dying would mean there be two less years payments in middle fund... But she made it work by going to community college to stretch her money which youngest is not willing to do! \n\nAll these people in here saying that you should have invested more in the youngest since she had less don't seem to understand that's not fair to your older 2! You're literally in a situation where nobody wins! If you would give more to the youngest then the oldest would be mad because you gave more to the youngest. Now the youngest is mad because people that are no longer alive donated to the oldest two college funds. You literally can't win!", "INFO: Did you adjust whatever money you were putting in your bio daughters accounts (if you were contributing) after you adopted your daughter in order to try to make up the difference?\n\nETA: Also, did you make sure your daughter was aware of the discrepancy over the last several years?", "INFO: Can you afford to help out your daughter or are you strapped?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She shouldn\u2019t be taking her anger out on you, but she is young and it\u2019s a crappy situation. Give her some time to cool off and think, tell her you will do what you can to help out and support her, but that it\u2019s not possible for you guys to take out loans right now.

Was this just dropped in her lap without any prior knowledge?  \n\nI completely understand that you don\u2019t want to jeopardize/postpone your retirement.  However, most kids understand way in advance whether or not they will be responsible for paying for college.  Did you help her seek out partial/full scholarships to help with her tuition?  \n\nLook, at the end of the day, it sounds like your decision has been made.  Just keep in mind she may hold this against you by being treated differently.  The facts will mean nothing to her.  In the meantime, I would strongly recommend looking for financial aid.  Also, see if her college of choice will allow her to take a year off so she can go to a community college to take the prerequisite courses at a cheaper price and then transfers.\n\nGood luck.", "It's an unfortunate situation... but NTA.\n\nGranted that these funds have existed for a long time, but unfortunately it sounds like your older daughters benefited from the circumstance of having this planned out by you and your wifes parents decades ago, whereas your adopted daugher came into the picture much later and likely wasn't planned for, based on your post.\n\nIt's unfair and unfortunate but... that doesn't make you an asshole. Also, realize that a lot of the asshole comments are coming from typical redditors who think that money grows on trees and you should just pick some extra money from the money tree so your youngest daughter can have a bigger fund.\n\nSide note: nothing wrong with starting out at community college. Getting two years of classes out of the way for cheap is probably a good idea because then that fund can have two more years to grow AND your daughter would need less time at the expensive school.", "NTA at all. The Y.T.A in this thread are ridiculous and are acting like you can just make money appear. With your youngest you had 7 fewer years to save, & didn't have the largest contributors able to contribute. Even with that you still managed to save enough to cover a year of college. That's more than most get and while I definitely feel bad that she doesn't have the same standing as her sisters she has to realize her circumstances are different.", "NTA \n\nConsidering it\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for any of your kid\u2019s college fees, you not putting yourself in debt for your youngest makes complete sense.

If you took loans for the others and not her it would be different but you didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a parent\u2019s responsibility to take on debt for their child\u2019s education. This is coming from someone who 1. Is a parent and 2. Paid her own way thru school", "NTA.\n\nYou are making the correct financial decision for both her and you. If you take out loans, you will not get the benefits she will for educational purposes (ie income based deferments or minimum payments, and potential forgiveness all together). Nor should you co-sign the loans. You should have her take out the loans then you can help her pay them off in other ways.", "NTA. I would suggest encouraging her to stay home and get her AA first- which you could likely pay for out of pocket for her (most schools offer monthly payment plans- I paid off my AA on my own this way). Then she can transfer, use her college fund for the first bit then take out her own loans for the rest like her sisters did. Or contribute what you would spend on her AA in addition to her college fund, but make sure she is aware that it will not go as far at a university and that she is responsible for the difference.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t supplement the other girls- the sad reality is they just had more savings to work with. If you want to delve it being \u201cfair\u201d try to supply the exact amounts the other girls had but that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t take out loans- if she wants school that should be in her. Personally college is a waste of money these days unless you\u2019re going in to a sure fire degree", "NTA. Am I the only one who noticed that the school accounts were set up by his wife\u2019s parents? The third child is not related to them in anyway. Now I would hope that had her parents still been living they would have set up an account for the last daughter but it also would not be out of line if they didn\u2019t. I do think it would be a gesture of good will to offer to pay for her associates at the community college if you are able. However if you are not then that is just how the dice fell. Does it stink? Yep and please please acknowledge it to her that it does stink and it isn\u2019t fair but there is only x you can do to change that. At the end of day a future employer isn\u2019t going to care where she got her degree so the onus is on her to decide if four years at her top choice is worth the long term cost.", "No judgement, because I feel for the kid and I know you guys provided what you could. I think this might not just be about the loans. I think she feels \"Othered\" from the other children. Her bio mom died and she was thankfully adopted by you guys. She should know that the money is from the grandparents for her other siblings.\n\nTBH looking into Scholarships would have been a great way to find funds. She was adopted, there are some scholarships for this. I guess it's not up to the parents for this, but i think it would have been great to try to find scholarships with her to accommodate those funds. It may not be too late to look into this. You post doesn't show anything about that. There might even be movement assistance in that department as well?\n\nbut I really think she is using this as if she wasn't loved maybe? That could be it, I don't mean to put any words in anyone's mouth. But have you talked about if this isn't really about the money?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIDK but she's lucky to have someone save money for her to go to school. Most kids don't get one these days.

It's just that seems like a lot of money was saved.", "NTA --- Sure, it's not fair. Life isn't fair. My parents were very decent people, but I got NOTHING for college except a 10 year old Studebaker. That was it.

I do not think you should pay your daughters college in full, as you didn\u2019t for her sisters. It\u2019s also not your fault that your in laws contributions were no longer available. There is some hard reality here.\n\nWas anything left to her when your sister passed? \n\nPerhaps a compromise would be to continue making the contributions to her education that you would have made for the 7 years she wasn\u2019t with you?

Your youngest needs a bit more help than the other two so is it feasible perhaps think about it? Both financially and also fine with the sisters?", "The first year is usually the hardest financially. Talk to the college financial aid office about opportunities that might open up in year two, for example being a resident advisor in the dorms while highly competitive l, may come with a tuition waiver and free room and board or there might be departmental scholarships.  \n\nWhether long term it\u2019s better to go to community college than a local school depends a lot on what school she\u2019s targeting and what her major is.  For children from low income families, the networking and other opportunities at a top ranked school can make a big difference in lifelong earnings.  On the other hand, for STEM majors, the reputation of the graduate school makes a lot more difference than undergrad.", "Why does she need to go to a private school? Would a regular college not suffice?", "The ass hole in this scenario is a system that does not invest in the future of our young people by insuring that higher education is affordable.", "Let me give some advice as someone who went to a private college and took out loans. \n\nDO NOT DO IT.\n\nI will always treasure my time there and what I learned but it was not worth being $100,000 total in debt. I have all that debt, with over half my tuition covered with scholarships and grants, but can't even think of getting a mortgage or living alone because of this. She also doesn't know this yet, but private school costs increase very quickly over the years and she could be paying up to $2000 more each year. Private college is not feasible for low/middle income families without scholarships from that same college.

In the next few years you have one more kid. Now flash forward to when the kids get old enough to get their trust fund. Does that mean you should steal part of the inheritance from the older two to give some to the young one that wasn't born when the inheritance was handed out?

These were the grandparents that wouldn't have been related to her. We would like to think that an adoption would make them feel like it's just as much their granddaughter but we don't know... This is AITA where we are always seeing people not feel the same way about adopted or step kids.\n\nAlso agree that grad school is different, but the one that took the money out for grad school is the one that went to community college...

As parents,  a little equalizing is in order if you can manage it.   Your youngest has chosen the more expensive option of a private college, which distorts the picture. Helping out with an additional $15k is the equitable thing to do.  It would also be good to encourage the community College AA degree to save money. When anyone looks at where the degree comes from,  they only look at the most recent. The benefits of college life and friendships are just as meaningful in the upperclassmen level.", "I think the compromise here, if you are willing, would be to take on $15k. She will have to handle the rest on her own, or decide to go to a less expensive school. Her asking you to finance (if I\u2019m doing the math correctly) $47k when you did not do so for her older sisters is not appropriate or fair. \n\nI went to a private college, over 20 years ago, and it was astronomical. I did get a lot of academic aid and had some help from my parents, but I footed the rest myself. The last $5k was just paid off in June 2022, and only because my husband received an inheritance from his grandfather. I would still be paying off the last piece of the loans, over TWENTY years later, otherwise. If I was the daughter, I\u2019d be thinking long and hard about other options.", "I need more info. How much was exactly in the accounts, because 15k could be either a huge amount or little in the scheme of things. You could have given her 5k compared to their 20k, u could have given her 105k compared to 120k. One is more understandable than the other. Now I understand you wanting her to go to community college, its safe place to get credits while also paying less for classes, but thats also not free, thats like 2-4k every semester. And after that if she goes to her program and transfers, she will still have to go into a ton of debt for it because you said she only has enough for around 3 semesters correct? If shes going for a bachelor or masters, thats like 80-150k more in debt (estimate based on the average i seen being 40k per semester). Now her life is way more difficult, if she got a job like me which pays like nothing (15 an hour) she would have around 3-4k saved for each semester. But i feel like she will have to move to the college since its a big program, and more than likely she has to move to the college which she has 2 choices, rent or get a dorm. Both options are like a bullet in ur pocket. When I transferred to my university, if i didnt have grants and scholarships and financial aid, i would have to pay between 20-40k a semester, rn i pay around 3-4k a semester. The entire post depends on each circumstance. Last question, what did you do for the last 10 years, did you solely put money into her account so she can at least be closer to how much each person got or did u just keep putting gin the same amount for each child.", "I was in a similar situation, and I am always going to be a little bit negative toward my parents about this.

Did you legally adopt your youngest? I ask bc she may have been entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits, and I wonder if a legal adoption extinguished such benefits. If so that is an issue (loss of a large amount of $) caused by OP\u2019s actions. It may be something 18yo. can sue over. While I applaud OP & his spouse for taking in their niece and raising her, I\u2019d like to understand if they sought legal advice on financial/future issues before taking any formal action. Ex. Maybe an attorney would have advised a guardianship vs an adoption to preserve financial benefits otherwise available to the child. \n\n 2. Let\u2019s assume for a moment there was at least some period of time where OP\u2019s daughter received survivor benefits. I am an adoptive mother and had to provide an annual accounting of such funds paid to my daughter, although in our family the funds were attributable to my disability vs death (and not something I sought.) However bc my daughter was entitled to them, I was legally obligated as a fiduciary to accept and properly use them. If the youngest was entitled to survivor benefits, or any other govt programs, did OP apply fir them? Did OP prepare and file any necessary filings documenting the use of any such funds? Again, if not, this is actionable. \n3. Where are the deceased mother\u2019s assets? Surely she had amassed SOME possessions by the time her child was 7, even uf she was not tremendously financially successful. Ex. A car (or a payout re: the same,) any jewelry, clothing, life insurance, a small IRA or 401k? Was anything held in trust for the youngest? Surely there were some appreciable assets-no matter hiw nominal. Money doubles every 6-7 years, so even a $10K estate at age 7  if untouched, coukd provide $21K for year 3 or 4. Also where is her father? Did he die? Where is his estate? If he did not die- why would OP terminate his rights (and obligation to pay support?) Could he not have created a legal guardianship to safeguard the child AND her right to support/any current OR future inheritance via her paternal line?  Where is the paternal family. Did OP shut them out? Seek aid (emotional or financial??) \n4. BEST SOLUTION- my guess is OP & spouse wish to continue to claim the youngest on their taxes up until she finishes college. Most parents do-fair enough! However, they also seem to be of the mindset that after high school, it is incumbent on the child to provide funding, aided only by what is in their trust. OP is unwilling to provide additional funding or aid her in securing loans. For those who don\u2019t know, a US student can not secure loans for UNDERGRAD education alone. (Grad/Professional students are presumed to be independent, but that is NOT true for undergrads.) Those just entering university/college must do so w/ participation and consent of parents via the FAFSA program- EVEN when parents are not taking on the debt. The max students can borrow y1 is $5K. That won\u2019t pay for all expenses (tuition, labs, books, materials, mandatory insurance) to attend any school I have found w/ my daughter (entering in fall 2023.) \n\n\nIt seems to me that the 18yo would be BEST SERVED by  emancipating herself (if the adoption was formal)  or simply claim independent status if it was informal. Then she will be able to apply and receive aid through a myriad of programs that exist to help survivors, independent students, etc.  Mb she\u2019d have to deplete her education fund for yr 1 and then become independent. Idk. I know some programs are only offered from day 1, so she may be better off applying fir those and relinquishing the funds. (A lot depends on her resume, grades, goals.) At 18, as an orphan (or a child w/ 1 deceased parent and 1 who is not contributing support, as I remember the post) 18yo. should be well placed to receive MAJOR grant, community foubdation directed gifts & scholarship money. I don\u2019t think that makes her an A H to do what is needed to qualify. She lost her mom & shouldn\u2019t have to lose her educational dreams. \n\nBottom line OP was not able to provide the same resources to his niece/adoptive daughter as to his biological daughters. That IS NOT OP\u2019s fault. (I do wonder why he didn\u2019t ramp up the contributions to her fund significantly once the 2nd daughter departed for school, since 18yo. is much younger.) Where I would have an issue is if OP did any of the following\n     - failed to preserve access to survivor\u2019s benefits (or mismanaged them) by failing to seek and follow legal advice re: preserving 18yo\u2019s best outcome\n      - did not seek assets from decedent\u2019s estate and hold them exclusively for the benefit of 18yo. \n       - did not pursue support or inheritance from bio dad/his estate bc 18yo was entitled to that\n       - attempts to block 18yo from becoming independent for tax, grant & scholarship purposes so that she may choose the school she attends. Op & his wife do not have the right to continue to claim her UNLESS they are able & willing to step up and support her at school. It sounds as though they are unwilling (not necessarily unable) to do so. \n\nCommunity college works for some. Others are willing to choose a lesser priced school. But in the end, the 18yo will be the one to live the live, utilize the education and, if needed, repay the loans. I learned about fairness at her age- although it was less brutal emotionally bc I still have my mom. But her decision to remarry a wealthy man cost me access to grants and aid programs that would have given me the ability to attend a competitive school. I had secured a substantial scholarship, but it was not enough. She had been a single parent teacher w/ limited means. Her income was my sole support & it more than qualified me for aid. My stepfather was wealthy but unwilling to support me OR pay for my education. My father was ill and incapable. But FAFSA/US Financial aid (incl. loans) looks at the income of the adults where a student resides not those actually supporting her. So rather than look yo my mom or my mom & dad, they looked at my mom & stepfather (where I lived.) despite the absence of an adoption or informal agreement to support me/pay for school. Mom & stepdad also got the dependent tax deduction bc I lived w/ them. Their income, which was inaccessible to me, blocked me from receiving grants or borrowing, yet my stepdad got a tax benefit from my brother & me. I had to give up my place at Wake Forest as a recruited debater (leaving my partner in the lurch) and attend a far lower ranked public school in the deep south bc it was free. It made for a steeper/harder climb up. I empathisize w/ 18yo. \n\nIt is NOT reasonable of OP to have failed to save $, bar her from borrowing (which STILL in only permissible w/ parental participation)  AND yet STILL expect to reap the benefit if deducting her as a dependent. If he is willing to help emancipate her, provide her w. resources that are hers and support her, I will view him in a different light. Right now- I find OP, YTA. BUT FORGET WHO THE Ass IS!!!!!! OP- you WILL lose her if you do not either let her file for aid independently (and stop claiming her as a dependent) OR help her obtain financing for her dream w/ the caveat that it is hers to repay. \n\nOther thoughts- Idk if the daughter is making a mistake. But it\u2019s hers to make. Idk think wife\u2019s parents needed to fund the 18yo. She was not their grandchild  But OP needed to make adjustments to their contributions or better manage the financial aspects of a tragic loss.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think it should matter how much her school is going to cost. How much money did the older two sisters get? Seems the only way to not play favorites is to give the youngest the same amount.

Private loans are an option, but they are pretty evil (you'd still have to cosign, and private loans cannot be discharged, even in the event of death).\n\nI have a few suggestions which will hopefully be helpful? As an individual dependent, your daughter personally can get a Direct Loan for up to $5,500 for freshman year, $6,500 for sophomore, and $7,500 for both junior and senior years. She should prepare to max out these options for herself--ie: $27,000 of government student debt she takes on personally. That would offset the 47K \"gap\" by a good amount (18Kx4 years minus 25K savings account)... that would leave 20K she cannot personally take on in debt herself. \n\nFrom there, she needs to find other ways to offset and reduce that 18K a year. Did she receive work/study as part of her financial aid package from the school? If not, she should file an appeal/inquire about that. Or, she gets a part-time job on campus. Either way, that kind of part time work can help to off-set things like books, toiletries, etc.--and help her pay more toward the 18K. It sucks to work part time during college but thousands of kids do it because they have to. (why, yes, I was a work/study lol) And over summers, she could get a proper summer job and sock away as much money as possible to help off-set. This could help with a few thousand dollars a year, at least.\n\nNext, if that 18K includes room and board, then, she'll need to go into school with a plan toward becoming a Resident Assistant. RAs live on campus for free. Usually you have to be at least a sophomore or in some cases upperclassman (junior/senior) to have this position, but it's one of the BEST ways to save money at expensive private schools where room & board jacks up the cost of attendance. If you play your cards right, this reduces the price tag for junior & senior year substantially. Of course, this only works for room & board, not if the entire 18K is tuition.\n\nSo would you consider taking a Parent Plus loan for the gap each year, knowing if she can swing the RA thing (and with her Direct Loan max increasing each year) that the PP amount would decrease each year? It could be a compromise where she understands that, no, you are not on the hook for the full 18K each year and will have to take her own loans, but you recognize it's literally not possible for her to get the full amount in loans even if she wanted to, so you'll help? (because, again, she can't get private loans unless you cosign, so those loans fall on you regardless if she can't or won't pay them back) You'd end up taking out loans for 20K or less, essentially, which is not nothing (obviously) but also isn't $47,000. \n\nBecause otherwise, she has to turn down the school. She can't afford to attend. Those are the only two options. 18K is actually NOTHING for a good private school, so it is a good opportunity if you can make the money work. But yeah. You need to have a thoughtful conversation about money with her where she needs to have a serious reality check and take some responsibility/do some growing up.

I don\u2019t feel like I can comment on the accuracy of 17k per year and I have no idea how death benefits work, but based on the info above they\u2019d have to be below the poverty line (0.75*$35,801=$26,851) for death benefits to not cover the cost of their child.

Also accounts for the cost of childcare, which is significant and OP never mentioned. \n\nI did the online social security calculator. Assuming the girls mom grossed $15k/ year for 6 years nets $1000/ month in benefits. Plus the tax benefits they would receive for having her as well. \n\nFrom that article you found your number from, if the family had income of 50-75k/ year, that amount is about  $12200/ year for 9-11 year old, but if you look at their estimates, they are quite interesting. First is the $3600 for housing. Since op didn't say that their housing expanses went up after the girl was adopted (just stayed higher 5 years later after the middle child left), that's not a valid estimate since their housing costs would have changed minimally. Let's say $1200 instead of $3600. That brings the amount to $9800. Then there's $1400 for childcare/ education, which op never said they paid for. So, let's say $400 for school expenses, new total $8800. Food seems reasonable, so moving on to transportation. They estimated $1800 a year for transportation costs. What exactly are the added transportation costs of having a third kid? I'm not aware of any sedans that don't seat 5. To be generous, they had to drive her around some so I'll say $600 for the year, which brings the new total to $7600. The rest of the assumed values look reasonable, but maybe not, since one is clothing, but she has two older sisters, so how much were they really spending on clothes? \n\nI've spent years line item budgeting to be able to afford to raise my two kids, maintain a house and car, and save for retirement. I'm in the income bracket listed above. I absolutely do not and have not ever spent $17k per year per kid even when you account for the fact that I live in a higher priced area for my locale. Without kids, I could downsize and probably buy a smaller house outright in a cheaper area with my current equity and I would still only save $12k/ year max after still paying insurance and taxes. Even adding in that added cost of housing, paying for competitive sports, travel, etc, I'm still not spending $17k/ child per year.", "I just looked up the average ss benefit for a child\u2026.$480 a month.

In the latter situation, monthly income goes down, but in the former, monthly income goes up, as does tax benefits. Even the older kids benefited financially from the household size being bigger, which means more aid for school than they would have received.

The cost of caring for, feeding and clothing her for the last 10 years shouldn't have used even half of the survivors benefits they received for her and are still receiving for her. \n\nHonestly, it sounds to me like most of her survivor benefits were used to benefit the whole family and not put away for her future. I think they should take a long hard look at if they took advantage of their situation to live a lifestyle beyond their means had she not been adopted by then.

If your EFC is $8k, then $40k will last you about 10 semesters. \n\nAs for taxes, having lower taxes effectively gives you a higher income. If you have more dependents (prior to 2020), your taxable income is lower. Then child tax credits bring your tax liability down even more. If your taxes are $3000 less because you have a child, then you can either change your take home withholdings and have more each paycheck or get a refund when you file taxes.

If you run into financial trouble,  you will have very few options to prevent it from going into default, and will never have the same options for forgiveness. If your daughter takes out Dept. Of Ed loans, she has more options, including potentially forgiveness from income-driven repayment plans, etc. Parents are DROWNING in the debt of their children with no benefit to them, and it can turn into a desperate situation very fast. \n\nOn the other hand, private loans are similar- fewer options, no real benefit to you, and if you can't afford payments,  too bad. \n\nWhat might be a potential compromise is to pay down the interest on any loans she takes out, up to an amount that would make up the deficit between accounts faster. That way, she can actually get ahead of her loans and exercise options if she can't afford payments, and you won't go into default if an emergency happens and affects your ability to pay.

Do not take out a loan!!!\n\n\nTLDR -----\u2010-------------\nYour daughter needs to recognize the privilege she has of being handed $25,000 for her education, no strings attached. She is making an expensive choice, and has to deal with the consequences of her adult decisions now. She isn't being forced to go to that school. Her circumstances are different than her sister's. That's not your fault; it's just how the cards fell. She shouldn't be mad at you for that, or for their grandparents dying before they could give her money. \n------\u2010-------------------\u2010---\n\nShe's missing a huge point in all of this: she seems to be more entitled than grateful about being handed $25,000. Don't get me wrong, the cost of higher education is unreasonably expensive, **but paying for her expensive choices is not teaching her anything.** A lot of people seem to be diving in to the logistics of the savings accounts, but what stood out to me was maturity and mindset. \n\nShe is choosing to pay for the experience - and that's her choice - but it is also her own responsibility. Your older kids had more money, sure, but they still made some smart choices to made the money go further. Spending 25k for not even all of her generals is absurd (in my opinion). She doesn't want to take out her own loans? Do work study. Get a job during school, and work full time in the summer. Yes, her savings is smaller, but she's incredibly lucky to have one in the first place. That $ could still pay for nearly all of her tuition if spent wisely.\n\nI know people who went to more expensive colleges who transferred to a cheaper school after a year, including the school I went to. They all regretted paying 15k+ for their generals, especially the ones who didn't end up finishing.  Either she'll make it work or she won't, but whatever she does she has to accept the good and bad consequences of her adult decisions. You shouldn't be footing the bill for the bad part of her decision, especially because it isn't the only option. She could even do 2 years of community college first, THEN transfer to that school if she's still set on it.\n\nAs far as what is \"fair\"... fair is subjective. I come from a rural area and an extremely poor family. My brother had the luxury of never having to work through high school, and my mom could afford for him to play sports all year. On the other hand, I started working at 15 to help keep the lights on. I dealt with pretty extreme poverty my teenage years that he didn't. Fair? Maybe; maybe not. Either way I'm not mad at my brother or at my parents for me growing up poor, because there were a lot of things outside of their control, just as there is to how much savings your daughters ended up with. I'm grateful I was even able to go to college.\n\nI have a somewhat similar experience with my #1 school choice, though. I got in to my dream school/program where I was one of <40 people accepted each semester, and worked so hard to get in without having a 4.0 GPA. But once I got a breakdown of the cost, I realized it wasn't feasible for me. I went to a tech school for a couple years then transferred to a state school. I still had to take out loans and work full time, and I always lived off campus with roommates. It wasn't easy, but those were the cards I was dealt and I was determined to get my degree. It ended up being a blessing in disguise, because I didn't 100% know what I wanted to do at the time, but changing schools and working different jobs helped me figure it out. I now work for the same place I always wanted to that is affiliated with my old dream school, but with a different career, and tens of thousands of dollars less in debt.\n\nMaybe when she's in her last year and she's figured things out a little more, that would be a better time to help if you so choose, but it sounds like she needs time to grow up a bit more. I don't mean that in a bad way, I'm just saying everyone changes the first couple years out of high school and this might be one of those times she has to figure it out for herself.", "YTA.

Are there people who do misuse these funds? Sure, of course there are. A lot of people in this world just totally suck.

If anything, the daughter is being the AH here (seriously, refusing to speak with them unless they take out loans to support her top choice [and I am sure over-priced] private College??

There are also limits on what dependent students can borrow in direct loans per year and they have *not* kept pace with college costs since about the 1990s.", "But as a counter point, as a lower middle class family, I only qualified for the Pell grant.

MIT somewhat famously provides very generous financial assistance to *every* accepted student that doesn't clear tution based on their FAFSA.  They very likely wouldn't have needed very much in loans.  And if they had, there's no such thing as student loans that put you \"in the hole\" every month -- certainly not by $2500.  Federal student loans have multiple income-based programs designed to prevent them from having an insurmountable impact on students, and will lower the payments to whatever is required for it to fit within a more reasonable budget.", "Doesn't MIT have amazing financial aid with its giant endowment?

There's no shame. \n\nGetting a job and going to school at the same time teaches you life skills. And if you fail a class, that's $1k dollars down the drain.
