She texted my sister when she arrived saying \"just got your sister's, ttyl.\" My sister responded with \"have fun lolol\" and followed it up with another text saying \"dumb wedding\". Coincidentally, my mother was showing me something on her phone when my sister texted that. Sister tried to immediately delete, which is something I guess iPhones can do to each other? I give my mom back her phone and at this point I'm so angry I can't sit. I'm pacing around the house. Since the 'dumb wedding' message had disappeared, my mother almost didn't believe it happened. She texted my sister and asked if she said that. Sister admitted it. Mother asked why she would say something like that, and that I saw it. My sister's response was \"whelp.\" Then wanted to know HOW I saw it. My anger has turned into sadness and I started crying. I told my mother that it was bullshit to be treated this way by my sister who is close to 40. My mother told my sister I was very upset, and said to stop acting 'silly'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe entire day I spent in a funk. Years of trauma and abuse make me susceptible to other people's emotions and thoughts and I have a hard time snapping out of it (not just family but a horribly fucked up first marriage). I'm also trying to rack my brain and figure out genuinely why I deserve this. At one point, we were at the venue with my mother-in-law who asked me what was wrong. My mother interrupted and said I was tired and winked at me. Later I told my MIL the truth. I'm not ashamed or embarrassed, and I'm not going to lie to protect my sister. When my mother and sister spoke later that night, my sister tried to change her story. She said that I took it wrong and she meant expensive weddings are dumb. But she has no idea how much money I've spent on the wedding or any of the details. And come on, if that's what she meant she would have clarified immediately. My mother seemed to sort of believe her bullshit excuse. Wedding day came, never heard from my sister. The wedding was gorgeous and I'm honestly relieved she wasn't there. Extended family came into town and my sister scheduled dinner with them the day before the wedding to make sure she could see them, which annoyed me.\n\n  \nIt's been over a week and I still haven't heard from her. It further cements my decision to cut things off and not relent, because she knew I was upset and crying about what she said, and she still couldn't reach out to me to set things straight. Sadly, my mother DID tell her about some of the details of the wedding. She claims she didn't send any pictures. I was upset because I clearly told mom not to give any info about it. But it is what it is.", "created_utc": 1700500092, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ztc3s/update_aita_for_my_wedding_date/", "score": 307, "replies": ["Your sister is a horrible, sad shrew, and your mother is a big-time enabler.   \n\n\nI'm glad you cut her out of your day, but also sad that you let her ruin it a bit for you.", "Still NTA.

Congratulations", "NTA\n\nYour sister is horrid and your mother isn't much better, what with all the enabling.", "esh. it's clear that your sister's comments were hurtful and disrespectful especially on the day before your wedding. however the way you handled the situation with your mother and sister seems to have escalated the issue. it's unfortunate that your sister couldn't reach out and apologize but cutting off all communication might be an extreme response. it's important to find a way to address and resolve these conflicts without completely severing ties.", "Looks a lot like ESH, every character in this story is treating you horribly, including yourself. Just thinking you need to figure out what made you \"deserve this\" is very disordered thinking, might want to get yourself a spot of cognitive behavioural therapy for that. At least you know you should cut her out of your life though.", "NTA, I would go NC with your sister. I did the same thing with my sister. I only see her once a year and I have her blocked on all social media.", "Grab your scissors and start cutting people out of your life.

And also because of a song and a freaking tattoo? \n\nAnd furthermore she has gone on to marry someone else on a totally different date, but is still so salty about 11/11 that she's being nasty to you? I would love to know how her current husband feels about her being so hung up on a wedding date that has nothing to do with him. I wonder what reason she gave him for her refusal to attend. \n\nIf this is indeed the case, dear old sis needs to talk to someone quick, fast and in a hurry. Preferably someone with a medical licence.\n\nAnd, sorry to say...your mom is an enabler and a pot-stirrer. I hope you realize that. \n\nYou're still NTA. Please go on to enjoy your life with your new spouse and let your drama queen sister stay gone. Mom seems to need to be put on a temporary information diet because it seems like she's running to your sister to tell her everything. \n\nYou said it perfectly in your original post. You deserve better.", "nta (not the asshole). your sister's behavior was disrespectful and hurtful especially on the day before your wedding. it's understandable that you're upset and disappointed with her actions. cutting off contact with her seems like a reasonable decision considering the lack of remorse and effort to make things right. your wedding day should be about joy and celebration and you shouldn't have to deal with unnecessary drama. focus on the positive aspects of your special day and the support from your extended family.", "nta. your sister's behavior is completely disrespectful and hurtful. it's clear she intended to insult your wedding and her attempt to change her story is ridiculous. you have every right to be upset and cut her off. it's even more disappointing that your mother didn't fully support you. stay strong and surround yourself with people who appreciate and respect you.", "Yeah I've been in CBT and EMDR for a while now", "No no, you don't understand, favourite songs are so much more important than weddings!", "Jeaus christ.  I feel for you.  I truly do.  But get some therapy asap. You let a stupid little text your sister sent your mom and then deleted derail you to this extent so much so that you made it into a big thing abs now this is how you will tenement your wedding.  Why would you choose to live life like this? Who the heck cares what your weirdo shrew sister thinks? You aren't close? You need to get to the point where youcan just roll your eyes at her shenanigans and move forward otherwise every freaking new family memory you want to create in your life will be trainted just like you let her taint your wedding.  Yes you.  Because at the end of the day you control your own feelings,  not her.  Not without you allowing  her to.  Therapy will give you the tools to begin this process.  Future you will thank yourself for doing this.", "I'd go LC with the mum too cos she makes excuses for your sister and doesn't have your back against her. Sharing details of the wedding would have pissed me off. NTA.\n\nYou should plan a baby for 11.11 now. Lol", "NTA- why do you give her so much power over you.  I mean you let her ruin your wedding with one sentence. Seriously though get a grip and stand up for yourself.  Tell her off and then cut her off. If your mom takes her side then chew her ass out too. You are like a windsock blowing in what ever direction people send you in.", "NTA. Your sister sucks. You have permission from strangers to cut her out of your life. Besides, she doesn't own the day; I'm happy to share my anniversary with random internet strangers (11/11/11).", "I'm going to be honest with you. I'd be at the point of cutting mom out too. Or at least saying stop telling her my business and if you can't respect that then I will have to go low or no contact. You mom has zero respect for you and clearly favors your sister as well as never calls out her behavior. She is just as guilty for allowing it. Your sister is a few years older than me and an incredibly sad immature and clearly miserable person. Move on, forget her and enjoy an eggshell drama free life.", "Stop letting someone else upset you. It does you no good. Especially as it doesn't stop the other person from harming you.\n\nGet it together and stop letting outside stressors stress you out. There is nothing good coming from it.\n\nAlso, some people get off on this. Just knowing that it gets you so worked up.\n\nAlso, people could be tired of always walking around egg shells around you. Live your life the best you can. Don't let others impact your life.", "You will never figure out why you deserved to be treated the way your sister treats you because it's illogical and you don't deserve it. If you aren't already in therapy please go, the hold these people have on you isn't healthy and while telling you to go LC/NC is probably right it's not easy. Congratulations on you're wedding, I wish the best to you and your new spouse.", "NTA So sorry she ruined your wedding. Maybe some therapy for you to deal with her toxic BS and moms denial and enabling. Also, time to go low contact or cut your mom out too. Set and keep boundaries. You have a partner who is now your family and you MIL sounds very perceptive and supportive. You don't need your bio family in your life.", "NTA - your sister sounds like a piece of work.   Stop letting her words live rent free in your head.  Move on and have a great life!", "Congratulations on the wedding! You're a far kinder soul than I. I'd have sent my sister the wedding pics myself in a folder titled \"You're So Vain (You Probably Think This Wedding's About You)\" and then blocked her.\n\nMay you have a long and happy marriage. And may God bless and keep your sister...far away from you!", "NTA. It is important to note that your sister didn't get that way without your mother enabling her. Your mother is the problem too because she should have nipped her behaviour in the bud a long time ago. She has let her run a mock with no consequences. I'm sure she enjoys the strife between you two. Being a parent means protecting your children. All of them from hurt. Allowing one child to hurt and bully another is encouraging the bad behaviour. She is the parent here. I would not allow your child near both of them because your sister will bully her and your mother will let your child be treated exactly the way you (her child) has been treated all your life. She is complicit. Time to cut them off. Think long and hard about your mother's lack of action in protecting you. It says a lot about her.", "I\u2019m glad the wedding went well!

Just to spite I would ALWAYS do a big anniversary celebration every year (either you both or get together with friends or family).  Congratulations OP.", "I feel for you OP. This kind of sustained abuse is hard to overcome, especially when it keeps recurring. I think to really heal from it and move forward into a healthier headspace, you should consider no contact with your sister and asking your mom to not talk to you about your sister at all (and putting her in timeout when she does). \n\nAnd are you in therapy? The way you describe this below reminds me of cPTSD. And just to clarify, you do not deserve this and did nothing wrong. They're just toxic people. \n\n>Years of trauma and abuse make me susceptible to other people's emotions and thoughts and I have a hard time snapping out of it (not just family but a horribly fucked up first marriage).

Don't try to fix it, don't worry about what she knows about you or not. Let her be the stranger she wants to be. You know how the concept of forgiveness is for you and not for the person you're forgiving? That it's a decision? Deciding she no longer matters in your world is the correct choice for you now. Don't give her any rent in your head or heart. She can be like a celebrity you sometimes get news about through the media (or your mother) but that you have no real connection to and so what she does and says has no impact on your life. Congratulations, btw!", "You are way too focused on your sister.  You really need to stop caring what she does or says.   So what?   Brats are going to brat.  It only affects you if you let it.

I'm going to cut you some slack since you were probably very emotional on your wedding eve, but it's objectively over the top to weep and mope for hours for that fairly minor text.
