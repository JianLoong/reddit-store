She texted my sister when she arrived saying \"just got your sister's, ttyl.\" My sister responded with \"have fun lolol\" and followed it up with another text saying \"dumb wedding\". Coincidentally, my mother was showing me something on her phone when my sister texted that. Sister tried to immediately delete, which is something I guess iPhones can do to each other? I give my mom back her phone and at this point I'm so angry I can't sit. I'm pacing around the house. Since the 'dumb wedding' message had disappeared, my mother almost didn't believe it happened. She texted my sister and asked if she said that. Sister admitted it. Mother asked why she would say something like that, and that I saw it. My sister's response was \"whelp.\" Then wanted to know HOW I saw it. My anger has turned into sadness and I started crying. I told my mother that it was bullshit to be treated this way by my sister who is close to 40. My mother told my sister I was very upset, and said to stop acting 'silly'. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe entire day I spent in a funk. Years of trauma and abuse make me susceptible to other people's emotions and thoughts and I have a hard time snapping out of it (not just family but a horribly fucked up first marriage). I'm also trying to rack my brain and figure out genuinely why I deserve this. At one point, we were at the venue with my mother-in-law who asked me what was wrong. My mother interrupted and said I was tired and winked at me. Later I told my MIL the truth. I'm not ashamed or embarrassed, and I'm not going to lie to protect my sister. When my mother and sister spoke later that night, my sister tried to change her story. She said that I took it wrong and she meant expensive weddings are dumb. But she has no idea how much money I've spent on the wedding or any of the details. And come on, if that's what she meant she would have clarified immediately. My mother seemed to sort of believe her bullshit excuse. Wedding day came, never heard from my sister. The wedding was gorgeous and I'm honestly relieved she wasn't there. Extended family came into town and my sister scheduled dinner with them the day before the wedding to make sure she could see them, which annoyed me.\n\n  \nIt's been over a week and I still haven't heard from her. It further cements my decision to cut things off and not relent, because she knew I was upset and crying about what she said, and she still couldn't reach out to me to set things straight. Sadly, my mother DID tell her about some of the details of the wedding. She claims she didn't send any pictures. I was upset because I clearly told mom not to give any info about it. But it is what it is.", "created_utc": 1700500092, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ztc3s/update_aita_for_my_wedding_date/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Your sister is a horrible, sad shrew, and your mother is a big-time enabler.   \n\n\nI'm glad you cut her out of your day, but also sad that you let her ruin it a bit for you.", "Still NTA. Stop granting your sister so much power over your feelings. She isn\u2019t going to change at this point. Congratulations on your marriage.", "nta. your sister's behavior was completely disrespectful and hurtful. it's obvious that she meant to insult your wedding and her attempt to change her story later is just ridiculous. you have every right to be upset and cut her off. it's even more disappointing that your mother didn't fully support you in this situation. stay strong and surround yourself with people who appreciate and respect you.", "NTA - your sister is acting like a spoiled child who didn't get her way.  You need to start setting hard boundaries with your mom after she shared wedding details you clearly didn't want shared.\n\nGood luck OP, enjoy your marriage and recommend going very, very LC with your sister.", "NTA\n\nYour sister and Mum to a certain extent are AH's\n\nYour Sister for being like she is and your Mum for enabling her behaviour.\n\nCut her out of your life\n\nGlad your wedding went well. Congratulations", "NTA\n\nYour sister is horrid and your mother isn't much better, what with all the enabling.", "esh. it's clear that your sister's comments were hurtful and disrespectful especially on the day before your wedding. however the way you handled the situation with your mother and sister seems to have escalated the issue. it's unfortunate that your sister couldn't reach out and apologize but cutting off all communication might be an extreme response. it's important to find a way to address and resolve these conflicts without completely severing ties.", "Looks a lot like ESH, every character in this story is treating you horribly, including yourself. Just thinking you need to figure out what made you \"deserve this\" is very disordered thinking, might want to get yourself a spot of cognitive behavioural therapy for that. At least you know you should cut her out of your life though.", "NTA, I would go NC with your sister. I did the same thing with my sister. I only see her once a year and I have her blocked on all social media.", "Grab your scissors and start cutting people out of your life.  You don't owe anybody a relationship, especially one that's obviously full of gaslighting and preferential treatments. \n\nGetting married is a new chapter of your life - so take advantage of it and include those that make you happy and oust those who don't.", "So, just to be clear: your sister had a failed wedding set for 11/11 FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, and is so upset about yours being on that date that she refused to come and isn't speaking to you, and is throwing rocks and hiding her hands? And also because of a song and a freaking tattoo? \n\nAnd furthermore she has gone on to marry someone else on a totally different date, but is still so salty about 11/11 that she's being nasty to you? I would love to know how her current husband feels about her being so hung up on a wedding date that has nothing to do with him. I wonder what reason she gave him for her refusal to attend. \n\nIf this is indeed the case, dear old sis need to talk to someone quick, fast and in a hurry. Preferably someone with a medical licence.\n\nAnd, sorry to say...your mom is an enabler and a pot-stirrer. I hope you realize that. \n\nYou're still NTA. Please go on to enjoy your life with your new spouse and let your drama queen sister stay gone. Mom seems to need to be put on a temporary information diet because it seems like she's running to your sister to tell her everything. \n\nYou said it perfectly in your original post. You deserve better.", "nta (not the asshole). your sister's behavior was disrespectful and hurtful especially on the day before your wedding. it's understandable that you're upset and disappointed with her actions. cutting off contact with her seems like a reasonable decision considering the lack of remorse and effort to make things right. your wedding day should be about joy and celebration and you shouldn't have to deal with unnecessary drama. focus on the positive aspects of your special day and the support from your extended family.", "nta. your sister's behavior is completely disrespectful and hurtful. it's clear she intended to insult your wedding and her attempt to change her story is ridiculous. you have every right to be upset and cut her off. it's even more disappointing that your mother didn't fully support you. stay strong and surround yourself with people who appreciate and respect you.", "Yeah I've been in CBT and EMDR for a while now", "No no, you don't understand, favourite songs are so much more important than weddings!"]}
