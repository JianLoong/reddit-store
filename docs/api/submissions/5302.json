Jane was divorcing her husband, jobless, and homeless. I offered to take temporary guardianship of Sara so she would be safe and cared for while Jane got her life together. At first, she turned me down. However, after Sara was dropped off to our moms house in dirty clothes and an old diaper by a stranger, while she was supposed to be under the care of her father, Jane agreed to give her to me and my wife. \n\nNow we made clear that it would be temporary and that Jane would still have full access and could get Sara back whenever she felt ready. However, during the last 6 months, Jane has completely disappeared from Sara's life. She doesn't ask about her, she doesn't make any effort to visit her. She doesn't ask us to bring her to visit. She has gotten a job and a(n unsafe) place to stay, yet hasn't offered to take any financial responsibility, not even in the form of buying her gifts. She doesn't call to talk to her or see her. \n\nI spoke to Jane recently about all this, and her defense is that it's too emotionally hurtful to see Sara because of how much it hurts and how much she misses her. Her other excuse is that she doesn't have a car or enough money to buy Uber's or diapers. I told her how absolutely ridiculous all that is. You don't need a car or money to call or text. We have always made clear we'd be willing to bring Sara to her, and she spends a wasteful amount of money on food and vapes. Even after speaking to her about the things she should or could be doing, she still has made no changes. Because of this, my wife and I have decided to look into our legal options for adoption. Sara has legally been abandoned, and we only need to keep her a little longer before the courts would allow termination of Jane and her husbands rights (husband is even more MIA than Jane is). Jane is livid about this and is threatening all kinds of things (but has done nothing). \n\nImportant information; after I offered origonally and before we actually got physical custody of Sara, my wife and I attempted IVF and failed. We hadn't told anyone about this, even family. However, I told Jane about this on day one just so that there would be full honesty and so that none of this would seem sneaky if it were to come out later. Jane is bringing this up in a very hurtful way during all this saying that I am trying to steal her baby since we can't have one of our own (we have one adopted son already). This is very far from the truth, we are genuinly worried about the safty and well being on Sara if she were to go back to Jane, and the fact that Jane has essentially ghosted her baby, we feel we have every right to pursue permanant gaurdinship and adoption. So, AITA?\n\nEdit as several people have asked, why don't I take in my sister too?\n\nI don't have space or money for an adult. Sara has a bed in our room, and we spend about $700 a month on her. There is no way we could cover an adult, too. \n\nAnd even if we could, she is not someone I would live with. She is a very unclean person (doesn't shower or wash her clothes) and hangs out with junkies and other questionable people. She lost her last living situation because her roommate was arrested for possession of meth in the home.

It seems like it was clear Jane and her life wouldn\u2019t be significantly more fit for motherhood in six months if it was already bad enough that you wouldn\u2019t let her stay with you. \n\nSo yeah, although I think you did the right thing by providing a better environment for Sara and that your home was better, I can see how it looks to Jane. You said temporary, it doesn\u2019t sound like her situation has gotten notably worse even if it hadn\u2019t improved enough to be desirable for parenting (and it does make sense for that to be shameful enough for her to not make effort - she needs therapy tbh), and she knows you tried to have a child in that time when suddenly \u201ctemporary\u201d is no longer temporary. \n\nI think if there had been an explicit \u201cyou have x amount of time and this is what I expect\u201d you\u2019d be fine, or if you\u2019d waited longer, but it does look like you\u2019re backtracking EVEN THOUGH you were well-intentioned and doing good things. I don\u2019t really think that makes you an AH so much as \u201ccould have definitely been handled better and more honestly* and I can see why some feel the way they do.\u201d \n\n*I want to emphasize here that I don\u2019t think you were being intentionally dishonest. It sounds like you said what you wanted to be true and maybe even believed was true, just that there was enough information, evidence, and context that should have made it clear that it wasn\u2019t realistic without more explicit communication/acknowledgment. That\u2019s more accidental dishonesty from na\u00efvet\u00e9 than it is a lie, if that makes sense.", "Yes, sorry. We asked Jane to babysit while we were out of town recently, and Sara was uncomfortable with her and even refused to eat or drink. \n\nThat brings up another example of her wasting money thpugh; we spent $200 on groceries so she would have plenty of food while we were gone, and she still ate out for every meal. Yet directly before we left, we took her with us to the store to buy some pacifiers and she didn't even offer to pay, but asked us to stop by the gas station and liquor store on the way back to our house.", "Same.  How do you spend $700 a month on an infant?", "I am not unsympathetic to her situation. I have been jobless and homeless. But all of that is irrelevant when it comes to being there for your kid. I'm not putting her down because of the hard times she's going through. I'm putting her down for ghosting her daughter. \n\nI've stated why she can't live with me. Our mom let her stay with her for a few months but ended up kicking her out because my sister kept getting violent when upset.", "6 months is plenty of time to ask about your child at least once. This has never been about where she is in her life, it's about the fact that she's gone no contact.", "Ok, but it's not \"irrelevant\". The mother living in a drug-fueled environment (and, might I add, OP has clarified that the present drugs are at a high-felony level), and if the child DOES end up in that space, then like I said, hello to the foster system. \n\nYou'd be right about these posts if OP was using a personal account and using real names. But she isn't, and so if by some circumstance court-affiliates DID find this post, it couldn't be admitted as any sort of evidence because it would only be considered speculative, or heresay. Trust me, my mother used to work for CPS and went through many a court case much like this one up until recently, so I know PLENTY about this. \n\nWhich leads me next to a point which you, and a few others on this thread, are happy to just ignore. Yes, six months isn't a particularly long time in a grand scope of things, but OP is correct when she says that the child is considered legally abandoned. It's not like OP is just swooping the baby away; Jane literally signed away her legal parental rights to OP because she's presently unfit to mother. But that's not something that can just stand forever and ever and ever. The child either needs to be 1) granted full legal guardianship by someone fit, 2) taken in full-time by the biological parent if they are deemed fit, or 3) turned in as a ward of the state, i.e. placed into the system. Once again, the mother has not turned up, and has said no to OP's overtures to have arranged visits, and therefore the child is considered abandoned, so something HAS to be done. But \"the same thing they've been doing\" isn't an answer. Unless everyone here thinks the child SHOULD be put into foster care, which I certainly hope isn't the case. But just some things to consider.", "I was adopted. I guess we see things differently.", "Taking on the care of a whole child is absolutely helping. Sister needs to sort herself out", "Exactly the vibes I'm getting. She just wants the baby and doesn't care what happens to her sister.", "You're not getting the point.\n\nThis is not a 'village' situation and goes beyond that. This is neglect, plain and simple. Someone people use the village sentiment to try and palm off their own responsibilities as parents. \n\nOP did not have to step up. She chose to. Her sister burnt the village down herself when a stranger dropped the child off dirty.\n\nIf you want to use a saying to excuse neglect, have at it.", "So there was never a contingent about where she needed to be in her life. The reason I am saying that time matters is because she has completely abandoned Sara. If she had been involved in Sara's life since the day we got her, it could take years for all I care. But the fact that Jane has gone no contact does make \"time\" matter.  Jane and Sara are strangers to each other now and the fact that she can't even ask about her shows where her priorities are.\n\nEdit; we took physical custody of Sara after the failed IVF. I told Jane about it the day she agreed to us taking Sara.", "Please keep copies of all of these things to show Sara later in case Jane shows up when she is a teen and claims you refused to help Jane and stole Sara.", "After all you told about Janes problems you would let her babysit Baby Sara alone, even being out of town?", "That will likely count as contact and restart the clock.", "Unfortunately your wife is likely correct about that. My brother supposedly \"just hung out with people who did drugs\" for years - he's now in jail for heroin possession. Very few people want to be around hard drugs like meth if they aren't also doing them too. My brother's story is similar to your sister's in many ways as well. He didn't abandon a child, but he was full of talk about wanting to better his circumstances and has never actually been able to take any action towards that because of his addiction. If your sister is partaking in those sorts of drugs, that could explain a lot about her lack of action towards her child. It certainly doesn't make it OK, though, and I'm glad your niece has you and your wife to step in for her where her parents have failed her!", "Ummm as an addict, I have to tell you: she is definitely using something", "She came to us with *nothing*.

If a soldier went on duty for 6 months and turned over temporary guardianship of their kid to another person, could they take the same action?  I doubt it.  The agreement was made, and OP should abide by it.", "She\u2019s been taking care of this child for her sister. Sister is grown and needs to straighten herself out. OP is already doing a majority of the work.", "I was responding to the \"hanging around with drug addicts\" part. That seems like a pretty big deal when it comes to child care.\n\nIf we deem everyone who is barely scraping by and addicted to smoking an unfit parent, there would be a hell of a lot of CPS visits. The stress that extreme poverty causes is maddening. For some reasons people always point out smoking like that's the reason they're poor. But it's a symptom, not a cause.\n\nDoesn't mean I think vaping is a good thing, but I mean that it's important to look at extremely stressed or depressed people in poverty with some lenience when it comes to coping mechanisms. Even if they are harmful. Because if she quit smoking now, it will not have solved her problems.", "Thanks for clearing that up (about the IVF, I misread the timeline). It sounds like even if she was involved, she still wouldn\u2019t be a great fit. I see your point about her basically abandoning. I would maybe set a timeline now and say \u201cif you really feel this way, make some effort to see her in the next couple months\u201d since it would take longer to fully adopt anyway. But she should have done that all along. \n\nHeartbreaking all around but I hope it works out the best for all of you.", "That's a very upsetting thing to accept about someone I love. However that comment did make me giggle, so thank you.", "It\u2019s a goose \n\nRight?", "\\*sigh\\* once again.... Jane signed over her guardianship rights. If she didn't read the paperwork, that's on her. And \\*once again\\*, that kind of situation can't stand forever and ever. By all legal accounts, regardless of what Jane thought was going to happen in her brain, whatever hopes she had of her sister just taking care of her child until she felt ready to be responsible, the actions she's taken do, in fact, constitute child abandonment. She has actively avoided seeing her child, and hasn't been physically present to her child for extended time. That constitutes as textbook abandonment.\n\nThe soldier comparison doesn't stand at all. Military discharge alludes to a set amount of time that the parent will be away, with a set return date and therefore scheduled parameter of when they'll resume parental duty. And that's what I'm talking about. Temporary guardianship HAS to be followed by some course of action, but Jane hasn't offered any. SO, ONCE AGAIN, the options are adoption or placement into the system.", "She didn't strip the child from her.

She decided to not see her kid, or text, or video chat, or have her kid brought to her. She decided to wash her hands of her own child, and then is pissed that she doesn't get to be a mom when it suits her, and have someone else foot the bill and do all the work because she can't be arsed to do a single thing to actually be a parent.", "NTA. There are two sides to every story, sure, but if you've presented everything factually, then you probably *would* be TA if you *didn't* fight for Sara. \"It's too painful to see her\" is the most despicable excuse I've ever heard for not visiting your child. When a friend of mine wasn't in a position to care for his younger daughters briefly, he literally slept in his car outside the home of the family member they were with so he could be near them. And no, it isn't your responsibility to house your sister as well. If you could and wanted to, that would be great, but becoming financially and emotionally responsible for your sister, who has made her own choices, is not comparable to taking in an innocent child who literally *needs* someone to be responsible for them.\n\nOn the flip side of this, however, you will need to prepare yourself for the emotional fallout within your family. In situations like this, the grandparents tend to take sides. Not to mention, if you grant Jane visitation, you have to consider her attempting to convince Sara that you \"took her\". I hope none of that deters you from doing what's right for your niece, but it's so important to be prepared for this battle.", "INFO: What's the rush to adopt? Have you talked to a lawyer? \n\nThis depends where you live, but since you have permanent legal guardianship, Jane can't just come over and take her baby back. And she can't just submit paperwork and grab her. Usually how this works is that if you refuse to relinquish guardianship, Jane would have to prove to the courts that she's a fit mother and would have to earn custody back. \n\nSo when you say this is for Sara's safety, have you actually talked to a lawyer and has a lawyer confirmed with you that Jane could gain custody back without a job and without a safe place to live?\n\nDo you think that Jane shouldn't be able to gain custody back if she gets her life together, gets a job, a safe place to live, and starts trying to pay you back?", "NTA This is the game. Jane knows that she is supposed to want to be a Mum but the reality of it is too much for her. She feels guilty and she thinks that society will look down on her if she gives away Sarah.

I\u2019m sorry IVF didn\u2019t work out for you, but maybe it\u2019s a good thing now that you\u2019re also having to take care of your niece, and potentially soon-to-be daughter if everything works out. \n\nMake sure to document all of your interactions with Jane. I saw lots of other people commenting it as well, but I mean literally everything. There\u2019s lots of apps you can get on your phone to record phone calls. I would also invest in a pocket recorder.
