{"id": 5302, "submission_id": "zrupdt", "title": "AITA for \"stealing\" my sisters baby?", "selftext": "My (F29) little sister (F21 we'll call her Jane) has a 14-month baby girl (we'll call her Sara) whom I have had custody of since late June of 2022. Jane was divorcing her husband, jobless, and homeless. I offered to take temporary guardianship of Sara so she would be safe and cared for while Jane got her life together. At first, she turned me down. However, after Sara was dropped off to our moms house in dirty clothes and an old diaper by a stranger, while she was supposed to be under the care of her father, Jane agreed to give her to me and my wife. \n\nNow we made clear that it would be temporary and that Jane would still have full access and could get Sara back whenever she felt ready. However, during the last 6 months, Jane has completely disappeared from Sara's life. She doesn't ask about her, she doesn't make any effort to visit her. She doesn't ask us to bring her to visit. She has gotten a job and a(n unsafe) place to stay, yet hasn't offered to take any financial responsibility, not even in the form of buying her gifts. She doesn't call to talk to her or see her. \n\nI spoke to Jane recently about all this, and her defense is that it's too emotionally hurtful to see Sara because of how much it hurts and how much she misses her. Her other excuse is that she doesn't have a car or enough money to buy Uber's or diapers. I told her how absolutely ridiculous all that is. You don't need a car or money to call or text. We have always made clear we'd be willing to bring Sara to her, and she spends a wasteful amount of money on food and vapes. Even after speaking to her about the things she should or could be doing, she still has made no changes. Because of this, my wife and I have decided to look into our legal options for adoption. Sara has legally been abandoned, and we only need to keep her a little longer before the courts would allow termination of Jane and her husbands rights (husband is even more MIA than Jane is). Jane is livid about this and is threatening all kinds of things (but has done nothing). \n\nImportant information; after I offered origonally and before we actually got physical custody of Sara, my wife and I attempted IVF and failed. We hadn't told anyone about this, even family. However, I told Jane about this on day one just so that there would be full honesty and so that none of this would seem sneaky if it were to come out later. Jane is bringing this up in a very hurtful way during all this saying that I am trying to steal her baby since we can't have one of our own (we have one adopted son already). This is very far from the truth, we are genuinly worried about the safety and well being of Sara if she were to go back to Jane, and the fact that Jane has essentially ghosted her baby, we feel we have every right to pursue permanant gaurdinship and adoption. So, AITA?\n\nEdit 1: As several people have asked, why don't I take in my sister too?\n\nI don't have space or money for an adult. Sara has a bed in our room, and we spend about $700 a month on her. There is no way we could cover an adult, too. \n\nAnd even if we could, she is not someone I would live with. She is a very unclean person (doesn't shower or wash her clothes) and hangs out with junkies and other questionable people. She lost her last living situation because her roommate was arrested for possession of meth in the home. My wife and I have a 7 year old son, and now Sara, to protect.\n\nEdit 2: In regards to the $700 a month, that is an average. She came to us with *nothing*. We had to buy clothes, bottles, formula, a bed, a car seat, a stroller, etc. Now that a lot of the big stuff is out of the way, it's not so bad, but babies/kids are expensive. She's growing fast, so clothes are a constant as well as dapers, wipes, and medical care. Additionally, I'm including all the legal fees we've paid. We count everything because we're keeping all receipts as part of proof of Jane's abandonment of Sara. My state calculates the financial side of abandonment as a certain percentage of total expenses.\n\nEdit 3; and this may come off a little aggressive, I certainly don't mean it to be. At what point is \"reunification\" just a nice way to say \"ripped away from the only family/home she's ever known\"? It's a sweet sentiment and all, but Jane is a stranger to Sara, and she is making no effort to change that. Years from now, when Jane finally gets it together, we're supposed to just give Sara up? Even if we did a slow integration, how could that possibly be less traumatic than staying in her home with her family? If she was a little older and knew what was going on and could remember her mom despite being no contact for 6 months, that would be one thing. But she's an infant that has bonded to us the way infants are supposed to bond with their family in order to have secure attachments now and later in life. \n\nI truly, truly love my sister, and I really want her to straighten up and live a happy, healthy life. But the decisions she has made over the last 6 months are not ones that can be taken back. *When* Jane gets it together, I will be happy to let them have whatever relationship Sara chooses to have with her, but it's not going to be a given that Jane will get her back. \n\nFinal edit; as I have my answer. I do just want to make clear, as a lot of people seem to be focusing on the wrong thing here; the issue is *not* that Jane hasn't been able to get her life together in only 6 months. She has been through hell and back, and I'm very sympathetic to that, I understand it takes time, sometimes even years to fix. \n\nThe issue is that she has completely stepped out of Sara's life. She has ghosted her, she has given up all responsibility and contact, and she is a stranger to Sara. Sara doesn't even recognize Jane in any way. The issue I am talking about with Jane and why I feel we should pursue adoption is because of the utter abandonment Jane has shown over the last six months.", "created_utc": 1671643258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zrupdt/aita_for_stealing_my_sisters_baby/", "score": 4393, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they wanted support for the child they can take her to get child support and she would have to pay based off her income. Honestly it\u2019s a lot of time in any of the situations where this could go.", "*Legally* we have permanant gaurdinship.

I feel like I'm playing god here.\n\nHowever, I would not at all say she is making a real effort to get her back. She is living for free with a pill popper that threatens to kick her out at least twice a week. Yes, she's got a job at the moment, but she keeps losing them because she doesn't show up and argues with people and just decides she doesn't like the job. I do apologize for just saying \"food\", I should have been more specific. She has access to a kitchen, yet eats out and orders delivery. She pays for her ex to eat out all the time,, things like that. I see that as wasteful if you are simultaneously going to claim that you can't afford to visit your child or buy them any necessities. \n\nI'm not clear about what Jane wants either. She claims she wants her baby back but makes no moves to do so. She claims she loves Sara but has gone no contact. I have attempted to get her gov assistance, therapy, jobs, living situations.

I am the one who had a miscarriage and lost our baby. No one on this planet, even my sweet Sara, could ever replace our lost baby. The offer to care for Sara was made before we tried IVF.

There\u2019s no excuses, she can\u2019t just swoop in and pick back up because the child would be scared of essentially a stranger coming and taking her (that\u2019s under the assumption they don\u2019t do like a slow reintroduction) now 6 months isn\u2019t a long time but it is enough to show some effort like a pack of diapers here or there or applying to job listings.

If you are not ready to be a parent after that year, we will seek permanent guardianship.  It is probably a lost cause but right now if OP seeks to adopt he is needlessly causing conflict in the overall family, and this is an infant.  The baby is safe, well cared for, and loved.

She had THREE YEARS to get her act together.  6 months is not nearly long enough time for someone who has hit rock bottom.", "I also addressed that in another comment and apologized for not being specific. She eats out, orders in, and buys other people food. She has access to a full kitchen, so 6 see that as wasteful when you also claim that you can't buy even basic necessities for your child.", "I\u2019m going to go with E S H, though I want to emphasize it\u2019s soft/light on your end.\n\nEDIT: changed judgment to NTA based on a misreading on my part, but I\u2019m keeping the original reasoning. \n\nJane is the bigger AH here. She\u2019s obviously not in a place to be the mother Sara needs. She needs both help and to put more effort in, and it sounds like that for now Sara is better off in a different environment.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think this should have ever been pitched as temporary unless it came with the explicit caveat that it being temporary was contingent on Jane getting things together in x amount of time. If you knew things were that bad then, then acting like it was temporary was either negligent (of how bad things obviously were) or deceitful (maybe even towards yourself and unintentionally). It seems like it was clear Jane and her life wouldn\u2019t be significantly more fit for motherhood in six months if it was already bad enough that you wouldn\u2019t let her stay with you. \n\nSo yeah, although I think you did the right thing by providing a better environment for Sara and that your home was better, I can see how it looks to Jane. You said temporary, it doesn\u2019t sound like her situation has gotten notably worse even if it hadn\u2019t improved enough to be desirable for parenting (and it does make sense for that to be shameful enough for her to not make effort - she needs therapy tbh), and she knows you tried to have a child in that time when suddenly \u201ctemporary\u201d is no longer temporary. \n\nI think if there had been an explicit \u201cyou have x amount of time and this is what I expect\u201d you\u2019d be fine, or if you\u2019d waited longer, but it does look like you\u2019re backtracking EVEN THOUGH you were well-intentioned and doing good things. I don\u2019t really think that makes you an AH so much as \u201ccould have definitely been handled better and more honestly* and I can see why some feel the way they do.\u201d \n\n*I want to emphasize here that I don\u2019t think you were being intentionally dishonest. It sounds like you said what you wanted to be true and maybe even believed was true, just that there was enough information, evidence, and context that should have made it clear that it wasn\u2019t realistic without more explicit communication/acknowledgment. That\u2019s more accidental dishonesty from na\u00efvet\u00e9 than it is a lie, if that makes sense.", "Yes, sorry. We asked Jane to babysit while we were out of town recently, and Sara was uncomfortable with her and even refused to eat or drink. \n\nThat brings up another example of her wasting money thpugh; we spent $200 on groceries so she would have plenty of food while we were gone, and she still ate out for every meal. Yet directly before we left, we took her with us to the store to buy some pacifiers and she didn't even offer to pay, but asked us to stop by the gas station and liquor store on the way back to our house.", "Same.  How do you spend $700 a month on an infant?", "I am not unsympathetic to her situation. I have been jobless and homeless. But all of that is irrelevant when it comes to being there for your kid. I'm not putting her down because of the hard times she's going through. I'm putting her down for ghosting her daughter. \n\nI've stated why she can't live with me. Our mom let her stay with her for a few months but ended up kicking her out because my sister kept getting violent when upset.", "6 months is plenty of time to ask about your child at least once. This has never been about where she is in her life, it's about the fact that she's gone no contact.", "Ok, but it's not \"irrelevant\". The mother living in a drug-fueled environment (and, might I add, OP has clarified that the present drugs are at a high-felony level), and if the child DOES end up in that space, then like I said, hello to the foster system. \n\nYou'd be right about these posts if OP was using a personal account and using real names. But she isn't, and so if by some circumstance court-affiliates DID find this post, it couldn't be admitted as any sort of evidence because it would only be considered speculative, or heresay. Trust me, my mother used to work for CPS and went through many a court case much like this one up until recently, so I know PLENTY about this. \n\nWhich leads me next to a point which you, and a few others on this thread, are happy to just ignore. Yes, six months isn't a particularly long time in a grand scope of things, but OP is correct when she says that the child is considered legally abandoned. It's not like OP is just swooping the baby away; Jane literally signed away her legal parental rights to OP because she's presently unfit to mother. But that's not something that can just stand forever and ever and ever. The child either needs to be 1) granted full legal guardianship by someone fit, 2) taken in full-time by the biological parent if they are deemed fit, or 3) turned in as a ward of the state, i.e. placed into the system. Once again, the mother has not turned up, and has said no to OP's overtures to have arranged visits, and therefore the child is considered abandoned, so something HAS to be done. But \"the same thing they've been doing\" isn't an answer. Unless everyone here thinks the child SHOULD be put into foster care, which I certainly hope isn't the case. But just some things to consider.", "I was adopted. I guess we see things differently.", "Taking on the care of a whole child is absolutely helping. Sister needs to sort herself out", "Exactly the vibes I'm getting. She just wants the baby and doesn't care what happens to her sister.", "You're not getting the point.\n\nThis is not a 'village' situation and goes beyond that. This is neglect, plain and simple. Someone people use the village sentiment to try and palm off their own responsibilities as parents. \n\nOP did not have to step up. She chose to. Her sister burnt the village down herself when a stranger dropped the child off dirty.\n\nIf you want to use a saying to excuse neglect, have at it.", "So there was never a contingent about where she needed to be in her life. The reason I am saying that time matters is because she has completely abandoned Sara. If she had been involved in Sara's life since the day we got her, it could take years for all I care. But the fact that Jane has gone no contact does make \"time\" matter.  Jane and Sara are strangers to each other now and the fact that she can't even ask about her shows where her priorities are.\n\nEdit; we took physical custody of Sara after the failed IVF. I told Jane about it the day she agreed to us taking Sara.", "Please keep copies of all of these things to show Sara later in case Jane shows up when she is a teen and claims you refused to help Jane and stole Sara.", "After all you told about Janes problems you would let her babysit Baby Sara alone, even being out of town?", "That will likely count as contact and restart the clock.", "Unfortunately your wife is likely correct about that. My brother supposedly \"just hung out with people who did drugs\" for years - he's now in jail for heroin possession. Very few people want to be around hard drugs like meth if they aren't also doing them too. My brother's story is similar to your sister's in many ways as well. He didn't abandon a child, but he was full of talk about wanting to better his circumstances and has never actually been able to take any action towards that because of his addiction. If your sister is partaking in those sorts of drugs, that could explain a lot about her lack of action towards her child. It certainly doesn't make it OK, though, and I'm glad your niece has you and your wife to step in for her where her parents have failed her!", "Ummm as an addict, I have to tell you: she is definitely using something", "She came to us with *nothing*.

If a soldier went on duty for 6 months and turned over temporary guardianship of their kid to another person, could they take the same action?  I doubt it.  The agreement was made, and OP should abide by it.", "She\u2019s been taking care of this child for her sister. Sister is grown and needs to straighten herself out. OP is already doing a majority of the work.", "I was responding to the \"hanging around with drug addicts\" part. That seems like a pretty big deal when it comes to child care.\n\nIf we deem everyone who is barely scraping by and addicted to smoking an unfit parent, there would be a hell of a lot of CPS visits. The stress that extreme poverty causes is maddening. For some reasons people always point out smoking like that's the reason they're poor. But it's a symptom, not a cause.\n\nDoesn't mean I think vaping is a good thing, but I mean that it's important to look at extremely stressed or depressed people in poverty with some lenience when it comes to coping mechanisms. Even if they are harmful. Because if she quit smoking now, it will not have solved her problems.", "Thanks for clearing that up (about the IVF, I misread the timeline). It sounds like even if she was involved, she still wouldn\u2019t be a great fit. I see your point about her basically abandoning. I would maybe set a timeline now and say \u201cif you really feel this way, make some effort to see her in the next couple months\u201d since it would take longer to fully adopt anyway. But she should have done that all along. \n\nHeartbreaking all around but I hope it works out the best for all of you.", "That's a very upsetting thing to accept about someone I love.

If she didn't read the paperwork, that's on her. And \\*once again\\*, that kind of situation can't stand forever and ever. By all legal accounts, regardless of what Jane thought was going to happen in her brain, whatever hopes she had of her sister just taking care of her child until she felt ready to be responsible, the actions she's taken do, in fact, constitute child abandonment. She has actively avoided seeing her child, and hasn't been physically present to her child for extended time. That constitutes as textbook abandonment.\n\nThe soldier comparison doesn't stand at all. Military discharge alludes to a set amount of time that the parent will be away, with a set return date and therefore scheduled parameter of when they'll resume parental duty. And that's what I'm talking about. Temporary guardianship HAS to be followed by some course of action, but Jane hasn't offered any. SO, ONCE AGAIN, the options are adoption or placement into the system.", "She didn't strip the child from her.

There are two sides to every story, sure, but if you've presented everything factually, then you probably *would* be TA if you *didn't* fight for Sara. \"It's too painful to see her\" is the most despicable excuse I've ever heard for not visiting your child. When a friend of mine wasn't in a position to care for his younger daughters briefly, he literally slept in his car outside the home of the family member they were with so he could be near them. And no, it isn't your responsibility to house your sister as well. If you could and wanted to, that would be great, but becoming financially and emotionally responsible for your sister, who has made her own choices, is not comparable to taking in an innocent child who literally *needs* someone to be responsible for them.\n\nOn the flip side of this, however, you will need to prepare yourself for the emotional fallout within your family. In situations like this, the grandparents tend to take sides. Not to mention, if you grant Jane visitation, you have to consider her attempting to convince Sara that you \"took her\".

Have you talked to a lawyer? \n\nThis depends where you live, but since you have permanent legal guardianship, Jane can't just come over and take her baby back. And she can't just submit paperwork and grab her. Usually how this works is that if you refuse to relinquish guardianship, Jane would have to prove to the courts that she's a fit mother and would have to earn custody back. \n\nSo when you say this is for Sara's safety, have you actually talked to a lawyer and has a lawyer confirmed with you that Jane could gain custody back without a job and without a safe place to live?\n\nDo you think that Jane shouldn't be able to gain custody back if she gets her life together, gets a job, a safe place to live, and starts trying to pay you back?", "NTA This is the game. Jane knows that she is supposed to want to be a Mum but the reality of it is too much for her. She feels guilty and she thinks that society will look down on her if she gives away Sarah.

This is a sober friend who is reserving judgement because the only thing that really matters is Sara.

If I do, it is his job to get the kids as far from me as possible and that if he says \u201crehab\u201d I have to go. I know these are the right decisions to create a framework to protect my kids.

All the tell tale signs are there, especially who she is hanging out with and being too out of it to bathe. Giving her daughter up meant she could finally use the way she wanted to (this is a standard approach that addicts and alcoholics use to use more\u2026). Using the way she wanted to meant that she chose drugs/alcohol over her child. Sadly, that happens a lot. \n\nPlease, do whatever you need to do to protect the minor child. She didn\u2019t ask to be born into this. \n\nAbout the IVF concern. Your sister is going to do whatever or say whatever she can to get her needs met as an addict.

The best people to help you out with this part is the good people of AlAnon.

I'm an adopted child, but I'm also someone who was once labeled a \"junkie\". That's a very hurtful word for me, I get labeled that a lot still to this day. I've had almost 12 years clean and sober, and I have four beautiful little girls and a step son. My oldest is 17, so she went through a relapse and recovery while my other children never saw me like that. You're not the asshole here because you have the child's best interest at heart. But please, don't think her relationship with her mother is gone forever. And please, be appropriately honest with her as age allows. Don't lie to her, but (for ex.) My 17 year old daughter - her father is a horrible person, he's been in and out of prison her whole life. This child was a blessing, and I love her unconditionally, but she was conceived during a time I don't remember - and that was not due to something I did. I don't want to use the word, but it caused me a lot of trauma. But she would ask about him, and I would try my best to be age appropriately honest. As she got older, I was able to explain things to her better. But I had spiraled out and started using opiates to cope with the trauma after she was born - it was just a very hard situation and I didn't have a support system. A family member originally took my child away also - and it took years of recovery and a lot of work to deserve her back. The situation was very difficult and involved the court system, and unfortunately the family members in my situation didn't have my daughters best interest at heart. Decisions should always be made from that perspective. You can also obtain guardianship without terminating rights, it's something to think about..my rights were never terminated and I can't imagine what would have happened if they had been. Just consider all options. Even the people you feel might not ever come back from the roads they're lost on - they can. Sometimes it just takes them a little longer to get home. \n\nAs an adopted child, my parents always told me I was adopted. I didn't have an issue with this, but my mother telling me my bio mother didn't want me numerous times through childhood was hard to bear. It created a lot of abandonment issues I didn't address til later in life. But something I tell my children for why they have so many adults in their life - either family members my daughter stayed with or the foster parents who briefly also had my daughter, we stayed in touch as we didn't want her to feel abandoned - we tell them they just have so many people who love them. It's confusing to other people, that our family is so different and blended. But it's healthy for our girls.
