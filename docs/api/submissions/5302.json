Jane was divorcing her husband, jobless, and homeless. I offered to take temporary guardianship of Sara so she would be safe and cared for while Jane got her life together. At first, she turned me down. However, after Sara was dropped off to our moms house in dirty clothes and an old diaper by a stranger, while she was supposed to be under the care of her father, Jane agreed to give her to me and my wife. \n\nNow we made clear that it would be temporary and that Jane would still have full access and could get Sara back whenever she felt ready. However, during the last 6 months, Jane has completely disappeared from Sara's life. She doesn't ask about her, she doesn't make any effort to visit her. She doesn't ask us to bring her to visit. She has gotten a job and a(n unsafe) place to stay, yet hasn't offered to take any financial responsibility, not even in the form of buying her gifts. She doesn't call to talk to her or see her. \n\nI spoke to Jane recently about all this, and her defense is that it's too emotionally hurtful to see Sara because of how much it hurts and how much she misses her. Her other excuse is that she doesn't have a car or enough money to buy Uber's or diapers. I told her how absolutely ridiculous all that is. You don't need a car or money to call or text. We have always made clear we'd be willing to bring Sara to her, and she spends a wasteful amount of money on food and vapes. Even after speaking to her about the things she should or could be doing, she still has made no changes. Because of this, my wife and I have decided to look into our legal options for adoption. Sara has legally been abandoned, and we only need to keep her a little longer before the courts would allow termination of Jane and her husbands rights (husband is even more MIA than Jane is). Jane is livid about this and is threatening all kinds of things (but has done nothing). \n\nImportant information; after I offered origonally and before we actually got physical custody of Sara, my wife and I attempted IVF and failed. We hadn't told anyone about this, even family. However, I told Jane about this on day one just so that there would be full honesty and so that none of this would seem sneaky if it were to come out later. Jane is bringing this up in a very hurtful way during all this saying that I am trying to steal her baby since we can't have one of our own (we have one adopted son already). This is very far from the truth, we are genuinly worried about the safty and well being on Sara if she were to go back to Jane, and the fact that Jane has essentially ghosted her baby, we feel we have every right to pursue permanant gaurdinship and adoption. So, AITA?\n\nEdit as several people have asked, why don't I take in my sister too?\n\nI don't have space or money for an adult. Sara has a bed in our room, and we spend about $700 a month on her. There is no way we could cover an adult, too. \n\nAnd even if we could, she is not someone I would live with. She is a very unclean person (doesn't shower or wash her clothes) and hangs out with junkies and other questionable people. She lost her last living situation because her roommate was arrested for possession of meth in the home.

She claims she wants her baby back but makes no moves to do so. She claims she loves Sara but has gone no contact. I have attempted to get her gov assistance, therapy, jobs, living situations. She just seems content in her own misery. 6 months of no contact with your child doesn't seem long to me as a mother myself. I couldn't go even a day without seeing or speaking to my son. When he's at the sitters or a friend's house, I am texting the adult and do goodnight calls with him.", "OP has clarified that Jane's living situation is one that includes drugs. Not a particularly savory place for a baby, and frankly that's just asking for the child to be taken away by CPS and placed into foster care. \n\nAlso, OP is a woman and already has a son with her wife. Read the post closer next time.", "Paragraph by paragraph;\n\nVideo calls. We were out of town without her for a few days and when we video chatted her 2-3 times a day. She hugged and kissed the phone. She knows who we are and knows our voices. That could be Jane as well if she had been calling even every few days. \n\nI'm female. I am the one who had a miscarriage and lost our baby. No one on this planet, even my sweet Sara, could ever replace our lost baby. The offer to care for Sara was made before we tried IVF. I have explained to her several times and in several ways that if she stepped up, none of this would be a problem. She still hasn't. \n\nWe still have about 6 months before we will actually be legally pursuing adoption. We will not hold any truth from Sara as she grows up (age appropriate, obviously) and allow Sara to draw her own conclusions.\n\nJane lost her last living situation because her roommate was arrested for possession of meth in the home. This is more than just an \"unsafe neighborhood\", Jane and her friends are unsafe people. \n\nLegally, we have permanent gaurdianship. This entire 6 months we have been talking to her and working with her to get her where she needs to be, but no changes have been made. \n\nWe do not take Sara to visit Jane at Jane's current home. There is a park within walking distance that we offered to meet her at.", "She says Sara doesn\u2019t recognize Jane anymore. FaceTiming a baby seems silly but at least they can still see each other and hear her mothers voice if she can\u2019t/won\u2019t see her in person or text and ask how Sara is adjusting and doing. There\u2019s no excuses, she can\u2019t just swoop in and pick back up because the child would be scared of essentially a stranger coming and taking her (that\u2019s under the assumption they don\u2019t do like a slow reintroduction) now 6 months isn\u2019t a long time but it is enough to show some effort like a pack of diapers here or there or applying to job listings. It appears she isn\u2019t doing anything at all", "Adoption is safer for Sara. Of the known quantities, OP is the responsible adult who makes better decisions; things like taking the kid to a doctor or communication with schools.\n\nIf custody is up in the air, Jane has more leverage to disrupt a stable home.", "Read OP's comments, she's already addressed this a few times. The short answer is drugs.", "Copy and paste of earlier comment; \n\nI don't have space or money for an adult. Sara has a bed in our room, and we spend about $700 a month on her. There is no way we could cover an adult, too. \n\nAnd even if we could, she is not someone I would live with. She is a very unclean person (doesn't shower or wash her clothes) and hangs out with junkies and other questionable people. She lost her last living situation because her roommate was arrested for possession of meth. My wife and I have a 7 year old son, and now Sara, to protect.", "Please look closer at the comments, then. OP fills in that:\n\n\\-she's hesitant to have Jane live with them because Jane mainly spends her time with junkies, and police get involved sometimes\n\n\\-It's not that Jane doesn't have any money; she spends it on smoking and doesn't try to save it \n\n\\-OP didn't \"immediately\" go to permanent guardianship. Jane signed legal rights of the child over to her sister of her own accord.", "The comment on \u201cshe spends a wasteful amount on food\u201d bothers me too.", "How? Jane is acting as a terribly negligent parent, and as OP states in the post, their situation equates to the child being legally abandoned. How on earth is OP the AH?", "Dude, Jane lives with druggies and spends all her money on vapes. FYI, vapes are more expensive than diapers. And if OP let the baby live in that household, that child would FULLY be taken by CPS and placed in foster care.", ">\tShe is doing everything she can to get back on her feet, but she is not quite there yet.\n\nOther than actually seeing the baby and saving money instead of wasting it on vapes. \n\n>\tIf your goal was actually to help your sister, you could give her money for diapers and give her her baby back.\n\nDid you not catch the part where OP\u2019s sister lives in an unsafe place?", "I don't think so. Sarah abandoned the baby for 6 months. Yeah I don't expect her to be established in 6 months but you don't abandon your child for that long. It doesn't require 1000s to call or text. Just keep in touch via calls if you can't visit.", ">After all it takes a village to raise kids and you\u2019re trying to burn the village down.\n\nThe 'it takes a village' sentiment gets abused enough as it is without applying it to this situation.\n\nChrist on a bike. Baby gets dumped by a stranger in dirty clothes months ago and the parents have not been around to see their own child since. But hey, OP can step up. She's part of the village, that's what she's there for, right?", "She is a grown woman, old enough to make her own decisions. So far those decisions have put her only child in danger until she left her with you.\n\nSounds like she might need therapy though, but at this moment in time, she really doesn't sound like she is capable of raising her kid. \n\nPlus, you gave her warning that you will be pursuing adoption, this is her time to fight and prove she really wants her daughter back... but she isn't doing anything.\n\nTBF though, she might have the more severe Postpartum depression, but that would mean she needs therapy and a doctor all the more.", "Things are bad now. But if you always leave the door open, with love and compassion, she will come back. It sounds like she's in a dark place right now and if she emerges from it a wiser person, she'll admit that this was for the best.\n\nTell your neice/daughter that her bio mother loves her. If in the future Jane can see that you never meant to estrange her from her child, healing is possible.", " Your sister clearly wants to have her baby back, which is absolutely her right\"", "I don't know the law for where OP is, but I remember my family doing a temporary thing when I was younger.  It was 6 months,   So after that at a minimum and yes I know 5 months is almost 6, so to me it is more about other things and less about a hard time limit.  \n\n\nIs the sister doing what she needs to do to get control of her life?  Not to the OP's ideal but, it sounds like she is working, and trying to take back control.  That counts for something in my book.    \n\n\nI would suggest trying to set a deadline, and say I will give you a year, from when we took over guardianship.  If you are not ready to be a parent after that year, we will seek permanent guardianship.  It is probably a lost cause but right now if OP seeks to adopt he is needlessly causing conflict in the overall family, and this is an infant.  The baby is safe, well cared for, and loved.  That, to me, is more important than forcing an adoption with a family member.", "I'm sorry. What quote were you referencing? It just says the word \"am.\"", "info: is your sister a drug addict?", "I mean, maybe she is legitmally poor?  We just have her sister's side here - it's not clear how long ago she managed to no longer be homeless. If Jane was entirely broke, without a home, just saving up enough to pay a deposit for an apartment is no easy task.", "let her live with you", "Ok, so clearly her living situation is untenable. It's not surprising given the living situation that she has a hard time keeping a job. Having the time and energy to cook is easier when you're in a stable home, and not exhausted with daily life. So yeah, I think you're wrong to judge her from getting take out.\n\nCan Jane live with either you, your mother, or some other family member for a bit? Could you offer to pick up Jane to drive her to your house for visits with Sara?", "So does she make enough money to live elsewhere? Also idk if you\u2019re aware of this but having access to a kitchen does not mean she has the ability to cook. That\u2019s actually a skill that lots of people don\u2019t have & it\u2019s extremely hard to have a job that affords enough for you to cook more than ramen noodles but fast food is more filling & often easier. She seems to be in multiple abusive situations with no skills or money to get out of it. & no offense but what did you expect? Without family or friends to actually take her in & help her find mental health & substance abuse help she was never going to be magically better in 6 months. It\u2019s seems like you just wanted a baby or else you would have taken her in as well. & I know you said you can\u2019t afford another adult but if you can\u2019t afford another adult you can\u2019t afford a baby either. Plus you could have stipulated that she helps pay for things with in reason. This is the problem with poverty btw. \n\nYou\u2019re sister has no real options to pull herself out of this without someone else giving her time & money & she more than likely knows that better than you seem to. We punish people with substance abuse problems & money problems all the time as a society but what is she supposed to do? Work a minimum wage job that won\u2019t give her more than 13-20 hours a week? Work two or three of those? Then what? Those jobs don\u2019t make enough for her to pay for an apartment, food, utilities let alone child care. Also are you prepared for when Sara is older & how she might resent you if not fully cut you off for adopting her? Look into the statistics about adoption, it\u2019s not great for the adoptees. You\u2019ve made your decision, just don\u2019t lie to yourself that Jane ever had a chance to actually fix this.", "well that's not a good reason.", "sounds like you're really not trying to help your sister at all. Enjoy the kid i guess", "He clarified in a comment that she had access to a kitchen to cook but orders takeout and delivery for herself, and sometimes her ex, all the time. That is wasteful when you don't have a lot of money.", "NTA \nAgree completely. Actions speak louder than words. It seems that Jane has made no attempt to have basic contact with or updates about her daughter. Why do people think her behaviour is going to do a 180.\n\nThe bigger responsibility is to Sara, an innocent 14 month old.  She seems to have a loving home with OP, and with a nc mother, I can\u2019t see the issue with OP adopting her.", "None of that is in the post and the comments aren't sorted yet... So that's new to me.\n\nThen ESH if she is pursuing adoption and NTA if she's keeping the baby longer.", "But OP did step up. The village worked in this specific situation. The child is not in foster care, the child is with family who loves her and are willing to fight for her best interests. I\u2019m just not sure after 5-6 months destroying the future potential relationship with bio parents is in the best interest of the child.", "I have suggested to her many times PPD and a therapist. She has every excuse why she can't do it though. I led her to water, I sent her programs, explained how she can even get therapy for free,,, she won't drink.", "She clearly doesn\u2019t if she can\u2019t be bothered to do the work to get her baby back.", "There are a lot of mothers who want their children back who have lost their parental rights because of the very issues OP has laid out and the refusal to take advantage of offered services.", "I hope you just missed the /s there. \n\nThe sister is like a doggy politician. Claims one thing and does the opposite. In this cases, says she wants the baby but is not involved at all.", "It sure looks like it.", "I may be in denial, but I don't believe my sister partakes, just hangs out with people who do. My wife, however, thinks I'm being naive and that she is on drugs.", "That's true, but again, she's not trying to save her money- she spends the money she DOES have on smoking, and she shares a home with druggies. And OP says in comments that police have been involved before. It's just not a good situation for a child.", "Absolutely. She got her new job about 2 months ago. When we first took physical custody of Sara, we agreed that we would work out a certain amount of money for her to give us monthly once she got a job. However, we have asked for nothing from her as we understand that after being homeless and jobless for several months, it takes time to catch up.

She lives rent-free in a drug house, and OP has clarified that she has trouble holding a job because she gets into fights and doesn't show up. So it's not like we're dealing with a woman who's trying her darndest.", "...okay dude, I feel like you really didn't read the post or any of the comments. OP isn't \"stripping\" the child from Jane, the child is considered legally abandoned because THE MOTHER HASN'T SEEN HER IN MONTHS and literally signed her rights over to her sister. The alternative option is that the baby is taken by CPS and placed in foster care. It's not that Jane wants to step up and be a mom, she doesn't even visit her child and spends all her money on smoking. She lives rent-free in a drug house. She wants to have her cake and eat it too. But please, continue to defend her."]}
