His father went half on a really nice older model 19' Grady White boat for his birthday a few years ago. Last winter, my bf and I decided we were going to move to Alaska and pursue our career goals in a state we've always dreamed of living in. We are both originally from the northeast, so this was a big move for us. It wasn't realistic for us to bring the boat to Alaska since we decided we were going to drive across the country, so we stored it at my parents house with the idea that we would eventually sell it. My bf decided on a price of around $2500 or $3500 for the boat after my parents convinced him it would never sell otherwise.\n\nBy the end of the summer, I get a phone call from my father that some guy came over and was interested in the boat. So we gave him a firm price of 2500 or 3500, like we had originally said earlier in the summer. I get a text later that he put 2 grand in my bank account. My bf was very but, he shrugged his shoulders and said \"it's done and over with. I don't care anymore.\"\nFast forward to now, fall 2023, and I travel back home to see my family for a month. My sister was doing my hair one day, and she asked me if I knew what happened with my bfs boat. I said, yes, it got sold, but for less than we wanted. She sighed, and told me that's not the whole story. Apparently, my brother (18M) decided it was a fantastic idea to trade my bfs boat in for a truck for himself with the idea that he would get the $2,000 together to pay for the boat, and act like another person bought it.  My father didn't stop him, yet encouraged it because he needed a vehicle for his new job that he recently got. My mother discouraged this from happening, but they didn't listen to her. Throughout the summer, my brother kept reassuring my parents that he would get the money together to send to us, but he never did. So my parents covered for him, saved $2000 of their own money, and covered for him. Keep in mind, this was less than we originally wanted for the boat. \nNot only did they go behind my back and trade my bfs boat without our permission for their own personal gain, but my parents covered for him and tried to keep it a secret.\nI confronted my parents the other night, a few days before I was leaving back to Alaska, and it was a nightmare. They kept saying \"they had no other choice\" and that \"they would do the same for me.\" My mother also accused me of bringing this whole situation up because I want money from them. Which is not the case. I wanted an apology. Which, I never got. I feel betrayed and I don't think I can ever trust them again.\nFast forward to today, I'm leaving home, and neither one of them said goodbye to me. They've managed to gaslight me into thinking this was my fault because apparently \"it would've never sold otherwise\". I still haven't told my bfs, but plan on it when I get back.\n\nAm I the asshole for possibly ruining our relationship?", "created_utc": 1698855455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lfs2n/aita_for_confronting_my_parents_for/", "score": 345, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Someone somewhere put in incorrect information on the registration regarding the sale.", "I'm not from the northeast, but EVERY boat i have had actually had a title/registration that needs to be signed in order to sell it. They even have registration #s. So someone quite possibly forged a signature. \n\nJust recently, I came across a boat that I owned as a teenager on marketplace. Just a simple row boat. It was stolen from my backyard 30 years ago. And someone a couple weeks ago was trying to sell it! I had a police report from the 90s and the picture on marketplace had the registration #'s. I showed up with the police and got my boat back. The seller had a few questions to answer. Not sure what is happening with it and I really don't care to follow up anymore with it. \n\nAnd yes, I am fully aware that a 30 plus year old row boat isn't worth more than a couple hundred dollars. But I'm petty, and I had a point to prove.", "Is $2000 what he actually got as a trade for the boat or did he get more and they gave you the lesser amount?", "I agree, but I think the brother really needs to be brought to account for his actions, otherwise I\u2019d have suggested get the police involved too. The OP is at liberty to do that", "I'm not that surprised as I imagine that OP's brother just told whoever he traded it to that he'd lost the title. OP's brother definitely had to falsify the bill of sale and claim he was the actual owner, but it is fairly common to buy a boat without a title. \n\nIf the person selling the boat doesn't have the title, it's still fairly easy to get it registered. In some states, all it takes is for the buyer or seller to go to the police and have them do a HIN (Hull ID Number) check on the boat and a VIN check on the boat trailer to make sure they weren't stolen. \n\nUnfortunately, HIN checks won't tell you much more than whether or not the boat was previously reported stolen. Since OP's boyfriend never reported the boat stolen, the HIN and VIN checks would come back clean and you'd get the paperwork you needed to get a replacement title so that you can then register the boat and get license plates for the trailer. \n\nThe process is even easier in some states as they allow you to register a boat with no title as long as you didn't take out a loan to buy it and have a bill of sale to show you legally purchased it.", "Great to hear. I just hope OP gets her just deserts", "I applaud YOUR petty!", "They traded the boat for a truck. But to hide that they traded it, they gave us $2000 later in the summer and told us that someone bought the boat for that much.

If the person suddenly realized they'd been scammed and couldn't register the boat, they'd go to the police or after the seller. \n\nThey came up with a dumb plan and only realized it wouldn't work when the boat couldn't be registered.
