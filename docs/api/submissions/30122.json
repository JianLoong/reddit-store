His father went half on a really nice older model 19' Grady White boat for his birthday a few years ago. Last winter, my bf and I decided we were going to move to Alaska and pursue our career goals in a state we've always dreamed of living in. We are both originally from the northeast, so this was a big move for us. It wasn't realistic for us to bring the boat to Alaska since we decided we were going to drive across the country, so we stored it at my parents house with the idea that we would eventually sell it. My bf decided on a price of around $2500 or $3500 for the boat after my parents convinced him it would never sell otherwise.\n\nBy the end of the summer, I get a phone call from my father that some guy came over and was interested in the boat. So we gave him a firm price of 2500 or 3500, like we had originally said earlier in the summer. I get a text later that he put 2 grand in my bank account. My bf was very but, he shrugged his shoulders and said \"it's done and over with. I don't care anymore.\"\nFast forward to now, fall 2023, and I travel back home to see my family for a month. My sister was doing my hair one day, and she asked me if I knew what happened with my bfs boat. I said, yes, it got sold, but for less than we wanted. She sighed, and told me that's not the whole story. Apparently, my brother (18M) decided it was a fantastic idea to trade my bfs boat in for a truck for himself with the idea that he would get the $2,000 together to pay for the boat, and act like another person bought it.  My father didn't stop him, yet encouraged it because he needed a vehicle for his new job that he recently got. My mother discouraged this from happening, but they didn't listen to her. Throughout the summer, my brother kept reassuring my parents that he would get the money together to send to us, but he never did. So my parents covered for him, saved $2000 of their own money, and covered for him. Keep in mind, this was less than we originally wanted for the boat. \nNot only did they go behind my back and trade my bfs boat without our permission for their own personal gain, but my parents covered for him and tried to keep it a secret.\nI confronted my parents the other night, a few days before I was leaving back to Alaska, and it was a nightmare. They kept saying \"they had no other choice\" and that \"they would do the same for me.\" My mother also accused me of bringing this whole situation up because I want money from them. Which is not the case. I wanted an apology. Which, I never got. I feel betrayed and I don't think I can ever trust them again.\nFast forward to today, I'm leaving home, and neither one of them said goodbye to me. They've managed to gaslight me into thinking this was my fault because apparently \"it would've never sold otherwise\". I still haven't told my bfs, but plan on it when I get back.\n\nAm I the asshole for possibly ruining our relationship?", "created_utc": 1698855455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17lfs2n/aita_for_confronting_my_parents_for/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You decided to profit off of your own brother-in-law for your own selfish gain. Take some personal responsibility and accountability instead of pretending what you did was okay. It was selfish. It was manipulative. It was truly and deeply dishonest.\"\n\nTo your parents:\n\n\"The way you behaved while I was there was truly shameful and I am mortified that YOU would behave that way. You mainpulated my husband and I in order to benefit your son. That is shameful behavior and that is NOT something loving parents do. Then, to turn around and treat me like crap because I called you out on your manipulation and the fact that you orchestrated a situation where my brother was able to take financial advantage of us? No matter how you twist it, there is no excuse for that. None. Instead of justifying this, how about you hold him responsible for his own crappy decisions that have lead to this point.\"\n\nThen block them until you are ready to engage.\n\nAnd, as for the extended family - if you get crap from them, tell them exactly what happened.

They lied to you after your brother, basically \"bartered\" property that wasn't his for a value less than intended. That's an illegal act. Then they encouraged his behavior by covering for him.

How much value did he actually get out of the boat? He lied to your parents and also attempted to deceive you. Your parents lied and covered for your brother. That\u2019s horrible.
