{"id": 13067, "submission_id": "120iznb", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend's son that his mom is a bully?", "selftext": "I (27F) started working at my dad's law firm when I was 18. My dad was the big boss and two of the lawyers working there were Eric (41M now, he was 32 when I meet him) and his wife Carol (36F now, she was 27 then). At first I was just answering the phone, making coffee and stuff like that. The issue is that Carol got pregnant and after the baby was born she wanted to go back to work as soon as possible. I never enjoyed working for Carol very much because she was always very demanding and uptight. I liked Eric more as a boss with him being way more relaxed and funny. My dad says they are both great lawyers but Carol is better.\n\nThey had problems finding a babysitter because of their crazy work schedules so they ended up bringing the baby to work all the time. My dad allowed it because he really didn't want to lose Carol. I had to take care of the baby whenever he was in the office; feeding, burping, changing his diapers, getting him to sleep, and generally giving him attention. The kid is 7 now. Three years ago, Carol and Eric started their divorce and they both had to leave my dad's firm because they hated each other so much they couldn't work together but it would have been unfair for one of them to stay. \n\nI had became very close to their son after spending so much time with him in the office. Eric and I also had became close friends. He started his own firm and asked me to go with him. He also opened up about his feelings for me and we started dating. Now we are living together in his big apartment and my life is generally great. This issue started last week when Carol came by to drop off the kid. I was waiting by the door happily and say hi to Carol but she was not in a good mood. She told me that my \"happy face\" was annoying to look at and that she missed when we all were using face masks so she wouldn't have to see it that much.\n\nShe always has that harsh sense of humor and I am generally not that affected by it but this time it made me feel bad. I started to cry a little in the elevator and the kid became worried about me. He told me that he also had cried that week when other kids at his school made fun of him for wearing a Sonic costume to class. I said that those kids were bullies and that he should just ignore them. He asked me if his mom was a bully and I had to be honest and said that she sometimes was. \n\nThe issue is that apparently he later talked to Carol about all this and ask her to stop bullying me. She is angry because she feels I am putting her son against her but that wasn't my intention. Maybe I should have been more careful with my words but I also think she could be a little nicer with me.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679661524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/120iznb/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_son_that_his_mom/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
