I (27M) was at this gathering with some close friends, and there was this guy, let's call him Mark (28M), who was a friend of a friend. I didn't know him very well, but he seemed nice enough at first.  \nThe evening was going smoothly until  Mark started sharing some stories about his experiences with alternative medicine and spiritual healing, and attacking 'mainstream medicine' altogether.  \nInstead of keeping my skepticism to myself, I engaged in the conversation, and I guess I came across as a bit arrogant. I questioned the validity of his beliefs, asking for scientific evidence to support his claims and suggesting that some of it might just be a placebo effect.  \nWell, that was a mistake. Mark got visibly upset and started defending his beliefs passionately. He accused me of being close-minded and disrespectful towards his experiences. I didn't mean to come off as rude, but I just couldn't help but challenge beliefs that I thought were, well, dangerous and stupid.  \nThe whole dinner table became uncomfortable as the argument escalated, and our mutual friend tried to intervene and change the subject. After the party, my wife said I really embarassed her  \n\n\nNow, I'm wondering if I overstepped my boundaries. Should I have kept my opinions to myself, especially considering we didn't know each other well?

Because espousing a belief in alternative medicine - in my mind - is a lower level of something that needs to be combated publicly in someone else's home as a guest....", "These two sides are NOT equal. Stop being silly.", "So it's the level you disagree with?", "ESH", "When you hear someone talking what you and most people would consider irrational,change the subject if not refuse to engage, you aren\u2019t going to convince him of anything.", "YTA.  You questioned his beliefs.  There is that word, belief.  No one owes you scientific evidence to support their beliefs (otherwise all those god worshipers would be stuck).  You can disagree and still be polite.  It also sounds like you have forgotten that a lot of medical advances come from alternative medicines, plants, etc., and if it wasn\u2019t for big pharmaceutical companies going after money, we might have more help, not less.  In addition, medicine, while science based, is still an educated guessing game.  All bodies are different and they behave differently when prescribed medications, etc.  Ever had a massage and felt better?  There is your alternate medicine working with your body to improve instead of throwing medicine at it that just covers up the problem temporarily.", "If someone had tried to tell me some meditation and sparkly rocks would cure my cancer, I'd have asked if their head was full of said rocks.\n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s a good general rule to, when someone starts up on an alternative facts based rant, just let them embarrass themself rather than  argue. Like, you were probably 100% correct, but it\u2019s just not worth it. ESH.", "I\u2019m somewhat new here, and was wondering what ESH means. My best guess is \u201cequally shared hole\u201d If so, lol.", "ESH. You both displayed insufferable obstinacy and lack of etiquette. You're your wife's person so she only spoke to you about it, but I'm pretty sure folks were probably embarrassed by you both. \n\nLearn to read a room and know what the right setting and timing is for certain things. You can think whatever you like, and so can he, but this wasn't the place for your attempts to argue each other into submission.", "Sometimes responding to crazy actually makes the crazy seem valid, and can even make a valid argument seem crazy. \n\nI apply this only to crazy that isn\u2019t hurting anyone- and admittedly identifying whether it\u2019s hurting anyone can be the tough part.", "Tim Minchin explicitly states in the text of the poem that he's being an asshole though", "\"I respect your right to have an opinion in opposition to current scientific knowledge, but I disagree with that opinion, and while I will disagree respectfully, I will not be silent about that.\"", "This is really sad, but I really think that most people won\u2019t be swayed by logical arguments if they\u2019re already leaning towards dangerous alternative medicine. Maybe you were the exception (and I wish someone had done that for you!) but most people just dig in further when challenged. I just lost a close family member who could absolutely not be convinced of Real Medical Science, and that was after like 30 years of people telling her gently she was wrong, yelling at her that she was wrong, actively showing her how she was wrong\u2026 and none of it worked. That\u2019s just how humans are sometimes and it sucks.", "Haha, I've never met one either...", "The reason that we challenge inaccuracy is for the same reason that we challenge bigotry. Silence = consent. \n\nSomebody who is listening may be swayed to forgo medically based treatment for cancer or diabetes or chronic illness in favor of water that's been shaking a lot. People have died in the past and will continue to die in the future because of such stupidity.", "Ultimately, the world isn't going to care if one racist holds one racist beliefs, if one homophobe old one homophobic belief, or if one idiot thinks you can cure cancer with essential oils. But while these idiots and homophobic and racist are spouting their nonsense, other people are listening. The person of color hears you not stand up against the racist. The closeted gay person hears you not stand up against the homophobe. And the person with a life-threatening disease who hears that there's an easy, painless answer for their problem may make the decision to forgo treatments that actually work. People have died from this bullshit.", "Reddit is so black and white that they think declining to give credence to nonsense by treating it like it\u2019s potentially real is the same as allowing bigotry to spread. \n\nLike. I know \u201cdetoxing\u201d programs are not real (we have our livers for that, boys and girls and thems!), but it\u2019s so obviously not real that I\u2019m not gonna argue with people who believe in it. I\u2019m not going to show those people studies. That\u2019s a waste of time."]}
