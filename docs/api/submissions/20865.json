What difference does it make to you anyway? So what if they are blended or foster carers or have adopted. It makes no difference to your son if his friend has step brothers, full brothers, adopted brothers, foster brothers or is just sharing his home with some random kids who don\u2019t know their way home!!! Keep your nosy face out of other peoples lives.", "YTA. You don't ask people these questions especially if you just met them since it's personal and frankly doesn't matter if he's bio dad. My husband oldest of 5 kids and he had different dad than his 4 younger siblings. Looks very different from step dad but you know what step dad raised him since he was 3 y/o and that's only dad he knows and calls him dad. So stop being nosy and apologize", "As the saying goes, ignore everything said before the word \"but\".", "I bet you congratulate fathers when they take their kids out without the mother. \u201cOh wow, someone\u2019s babysitting today\u201d. That\u2019s what you sound like", "The assholes always tell on themselves, man", ">people are going to ask \n\nSure, if they're nosy assholes.\n\nWhat's wrong with you?", "...wtf?? always about race. Grow up!! This post has nothing to do with race but yet here we are... maybe you should look inward if you feel everything is about race.", "I know 80 year old ladies and they wouldn't be this rude.", "Thats just as bad as people asking my kids if they \"know this man\" or \"is this really your dad?\" \n\nThey have strong asian features and I am 0% asian.", "ive heard nipple\u2026", "Which part of the vulva exactly? Cause it\u2019s a bit of a nude rainbow down there", "That's a great point.  If I recall correctly, it was the inner labia, but take that with a grain of salt because I can't even recall the source.", "I got a mental image of one of those diagrams in biology textbooks with an arrow pointing out \u201cnude lipstick place\u201d", "P sure I\u2019m right", "I totally get this one.  It doesn't even happen with different nationalities.  My family is white on all sides.  My husband, and I have dark hair and eyes.  My husband's father was blonde and blue eyed.  Both my grandmother's were blued eyed one was blonde and the other had medium brown hair.  Both my parents had dark brown hair and brown eyes, but my sister came out blonde and blue eyed, and my daughter also came out blonde and blue eyed, but my son came out dark haired and eyed just like his parents.  My daughter happens to look exactly like her father's grandmother, but absolutely nothing like me and only real close trait she has with her dad is body type (super tall and skinny).  I had people look me up and down, look my husband up and down and then look at her and sneer where did she come from?....like I had an affair with the mailman :/.  She has felt like she wasn't really one of us because of how other AH people behaved.", "Quite literally recoiled with a feeling of 'ewww' when I saw that.

Ugh", "I hope he doesn't punish the kids for this mom being a dick.", "Hey at least now she can truly feel ganged up on", "I also did kids programming in my library and I actually got a lot of daycares that would come in, so \"grown up\" was a great tool! With older kids I've even gone with \"your person\" sometimes lol", "TLDR: even with one of my siblings who was the product of an affair, I would never call my half-siblings half-anything. \n\nI never call my \u201chalf\u201d siblings half. They\u2019re my sisters and brother. And I didn\u2019t even grow up with my older sisters or brother, so we really only developed a relationship in the last 10 years or so for three of my older sisters and 20 years for my brother. I\u2019m the youngest of my dad\u2019s kids and when he died, we all drifted apart except for my next oldest sister\u2026 because I didn\u2019t know she even existed until I was 14. \n\nMy next oldest sister is only six months older than I am. My dad was married to my mom and went outside the marriage, but I couldn\u2019t care less. We found each other 22 years ago and met for the first time. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong and *is* my sister. \n\nMy little sister grew up with me. Yeah, I\u2019m closer to her, but fuck-all if I called any of my siblings half-anything.", "> Im an empath\n\nWords only spoken by the worst fucking people lol", "being really sypathetic and have a better grasp od empathy is the worst fucking people?!.... only in gen z narcasist world...jeez. ...Gen z are owed the world and can do no wrong and can cancel EVERYONE.\ud83e\udd23"]}
