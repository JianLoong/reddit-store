She can lose her insurance for driving without a valid license. So if she borrows your car, gets in an accident, and the insurance company knows her license has been expired for years, you might be completely liable.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad the cops are lenient, maybe they can put in a good word with the prosecutor to give your Mom a break after smashing up your vehicle when someone else hits her.  Or your Dad can explain that to your insurance company when they refuse to payout.  I'm sure all those people will understand your mother's need to be able to drive without a license because she's a special snowflake who exists outside the realm of reality.\n\nNTA, and your mother is a societal menace.  And an ahole.", "No way.  NTA.  \n\nI don't know what is going through Mom's head but... my mind didn't go to her getting a ticket.  I mean, yeah, thats a risk but its all on your mom so... hardly my biggest concern.  I'm thinking about insurance and liability. She gets into a wreck,  not only is your car hosed, but ... oh the mind whirls with bad possibility after bad possibility.   \n\nYour insurance wouldn't cover her injuries (or whoever else she hit) and likely not even cover the car (and definitely not the other persons car).  I would doubt she has insurance at all, as I cannot believe there isn't an insurance company around that doesn't get some sort of feed from the DMV.  Regardless even if they are not, and somehow she's maintained coverage, she is getting dropped and uncovered as soon as that police report of this proverbial accident shows up  and that \"license expired/unlicensed\" checkbox is checked.  I have no idea how this would impact \"fault\" assessment, but I can't imagine it would favor your mom.   Even then I can only believe that the other people involved in this accident, their insurance will gleefully tie this up for as long as they can holding this \"she had an expired license\" card, all while you are carless waiting for all this to sort itself out. \n\nThen assuming the accident IS her fault.... oh my... as various folks sue your parents and even you to oblivion.  \n\n\"So OP\", the opposing insurance company's lawyers will ask \"You lent your car to your mother that day correct ?\"  \n\n\"Yes\", you reply.\n\n\"Were you aware that her license expired...\" \\*makes a show of checking notes\\* \"2 years prior?\"\n\n\"Um well, I had jokingly asked her if she still had a license.

You'd be screwed if she got into an accident (even one that was completely not her fault).", "NTA. The issue isn't with the potential for her getting pulled over.

Do your parents understand that she isn\u2019t covered by insurance since she doesn\u2019t have a valid license?
