The reason is simple: We helped her out and even let her stay at our house for months rent-free when she had some issues, but she badmouthed us to our entire extended family and spread some rumours that weren\u2019t true at all. It has fortunately been resolved but our relationship is still strained.\n\nLast week, there was a fight. A really big fight that was escalated to the point where most of our extended family got involved. It was ridiculous and about a post made by some relative, which badmouthed my grandfather, and he tagged my mother in the post. Obviously my mom had nothing to do with the post, as she had a very good relationship with our grandfather before he passed away. However, most of our relatives are quite old and don\u2019t know how the tagging in posts work, and thought that she also agreed with him, and attacked her for badmouthing her own father. This issue was raised the most by that aunt, and she kept attacking my mom, saying things like my mom not coming back to our home country sooner was the reason why my grandfather passed away(???? he was 70+ and had stage 4 cancer did she honestly think he would survive even with my mother there), and kept bringing up things from the past.\n\nNow this is the part where I may be the AH. Her daughter had eloped with her boyfriend that my aunt disapproved of, her son ran away because he could not handle the academic pressure that she placed on him, and her husband left her because she was too controlling and manipulative. I said something along the lines of \u201cWell if you\u2019re such a family person then I wonder why your entire family left you.\u201d She was SEETHING. My mother appreciates that I tried to stand up for her, but I should not have dropped to her level. The extended family is on my aunt\u2019s side, saying I hurt her feelings. I think I might be the AH for talking about a topic that she\u2019s uncomfortable with, but my brothers and friends said I\u2019m not, so AITA?\n\nEdit 1: I have apologised to her sincerely and everyone knows it already. However, she has refused to accept it. Some relatives have been saying that I really hurt her and it would take more than an apology, that I should gift her some money to makeup for the fact that I disrespected an elder?
