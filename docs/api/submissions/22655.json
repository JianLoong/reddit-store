I am very happy and cannot believe I am marrying a wonderful person.\n\nFor context:\nMy brother (M30) and SIL (F29) have been married a few years and have 2 wonderful children. I love them to pieces. I have posted the children on my socials before on a private FB for family occasions. There have been no issues. After another family event, my SIL messaged me after seeing the images, to not post any of the children, her family (my brother included) again and to take them down. I said of course, respected her decision as they are her children. I later found out I was the only one of my siblings asked to do this. It did hurt, however, these are her children, her rules.\n\nPresent:\nI sent out the invites earlier this week. I sent a private message to my brother saying the follow:\n\"Hey bro, I hope all is well. I just wanted to give you heads up about the upcoming day. As you know, we will be having a photographer taking pictures at our wedding. Each photo we will be doing of the official portraits will be done twice. One with your family, and one without. This is to respect your rules about posting pictures of your family online. You will be sent all of the photos with you guys in, and can distribute them however you wish. My fiance and I wish to share our big day online, especially with friends and family who couldn't make it as it is a big day for us. Love you lots\". I also sent a picture of the message my SIL sent me to him for context.\n\nHe and his wife then got mad at me, calling and screaming at me down the phone as their kids will feel left out and no one will know they are there. I haven't posted about the kids since that message. Every time there is a family event, I ask, and they say no every time. So I did stop asking a year ago and just assumed I could never post them.\n\nSo AITA? Did I take it too far?\n\nEdit: I have asked about putting smiley faces on their faces, but my SIL says it's rude and I would still be posting them.\nI should also add that are there any circumstances to which posting them would be allowed, and my SIL said not at all.\n\nEdit 2:  They have asked that their kids be in all the other photos the children will be in so they don't feel left out, but the photos they are in are not allowed to be shared with others. But NO ONE is allowed to share any images with them or their children in.\n\nEdit 3: The kids are not adopted.", "created_utc": 1689773460, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153v5eg/aita_for_doing_different_photos_on_my_wedding_day/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My god they sound exhausting. I wouldn't even be talking to them at this point.", "NTA. Is she insane? She wants to force you to include her children in your photos so that you\u2019re not allowed to post any of your wedding photos. Tell her to shove it, and her children will be in separate photos. Don\u2019t let her ruin your wedding because she\u2019s unhinged.", "NTA - You are going out of your way to take duplicate photos during your wedding day to accommodate their boundaries while still making them feel included. All of that additional time is time that you can't spend enjoying your reception and being with your other guests. Not to mention some photography packages only include editing for a certain number of photos - so every duplicate photo you take for their sake could mean giving up another photo that you would have wanted.\n\nThe fact that they are saying that you are the bad guy for going out of your way to accommodate them is insane. Like clinically insane. \n\nI would rescind this offer if I were you. You are being entirely too generous to people who don't deserve it. Tell them that if they don't want photos of themselves or their children to be shared, then they can choose to not be in the photos. They do not get to control what you do with your own wedding photos, they can only control whether or not they are in them.", "NTA.\n\nSIL has been setting the precedent on numerous occasions and all you've done is let them know that you're accommodating SIL's request within your wedding.

You stop posting photos of their kids.

Weddings are about two people.", "Info: it sounds like your siblings are allowed to post photos of the kids- did you ever find out why she only asked you to not do this?\n\nIt sounds like she wants it both ways. The solution seems to be just to take the photos you want to take and simply leave out any with the kids- and if that means no full family photos get posted, so be it.", "INFO: So for the wedding day they *do* want you to post photos of their kids?", "NTA.  This is your day and you want to share your pictures on-line with friends and family.  Your solution allows you to do what you want while respecting their boundaries.    Tell them they are very much included and they are more than welcome to post the pictures that includes their family online.  They cannot hold your pictures hostage to their demands and you basically are taking away their power in this matter.  They basically telling you my kinds in your pictures no online posting and your said fine than we will do it without them and post.  Done.  They do not have a say so on this at all and they are the AHs in this matter.", "NTA. I think it's pretty generous to book extra time, extra charges, with a photographer, just so you can respect her wishes. Why are they taking it badly? You're still going to have pics with them.", "NTA They get to be in the photos which will be posted online or not be in photos. You\u2019ve left the options open to them but they can\u2019t insist that you don\u2019t post any photos online.

Im curios what did you do wrong, but ultimately - in the current situation you are perfectly reasonable.\n\nI would just calmly repeat that the wedding photos will be public, and they have option of having smiley faces on kiddos or the kids won't be in photos.

These rules they have for only you are pretty outrageous. I would let them know this is the option available to accommodate them or they can opt out of the wedding. You\u2019re actually being very accommodating. Separate pictures without their kids or heck the whole family so they won\u2019t feel so bad. They can all feel like shit together. Make sure everyone knows you\u2019re doing this because of her rule. I would let everyone know before hand not to question why her kids are asked to step out so things are not awkward when it happens. Stand your ground on your wedding day. They don\u2019t get to make stupid rules for your wedding day.", "NTA. Just tell her that no matter what she decides to do, you WILL be posting pictures of your wedding party, the reception and family pics and NOTHING will change your mind about it. So they can do them because you WILL be dong you.", "NTA So you imply that other people have posted pics of your brother's kids online and they are okay with that.  Have you asked them why the rule only applies to you?  Also are your SIL and Bro married or just engaged?  At one point you say married but later call her his fiance.  \n\nYou solution to do double pics is very generous.   Their complaint that \"no one will know their kids were there\" holds no water because if you can't post pics with them in the pics then people will still will not \"know their kids were there\" LOL.  \n\nI've found when dealing with troubled people it's best to simply state the reality of the situation and outline a few basic choices open to them (being clear that these are the only choices available to them).  \nFor example\n\nWe're going to put our wedding pictures online.  That's simply a fact and not up for debate or negotiation.  It is going to happen. Moving on...\n\nI know you have some issues with pics of your family being posted online.  Here are your options.\n\n* Group photos as normal, you and your kids faces obscured when the pics are posted online.\n* Two sets of pictures--one set without you and your kids and only that set will be posted online.\n* You and your kids can decline being in any of the photos. This would make us sad but we'd respect your choice.\n\nI need to let the photographer know asap so let me know which of these three options you prefer.", "I know you're trying to comply with their rule, but this seems a little antagonistic of you. Have you asked if it's ok to post group pictures with those little smiley faces superimposed over the kids' faces? That seems to be what a lot of people do these days.", "Come on.

Your SIL will just have to contact anyone else who might post her or her kids.", "Is there extra context here? Are the kids adopted because that could be a big safety issue if they're posted in some cases and I can see why she also wouldn't want the kids to feel excluded.

You obliged?", "NTA \n\nYour brother and wife live in an entitled dream world. Yes, it's their decision about not posting their family on line..but that gives them no right or entitlement about being in any pictures at all.\n\nYou're paying the photographer.

It sounds like she just doesn't like you at all personally and maybe your brother doesn't feel the same way about you. So, you can't have images with just your parents? Just your husband? Just siblings? Just bridesmaids? What's her limit? You can't have an entire family image printed, posted on social media? Nothing ever displayed bevause she/he doesn't like you? No. They literally just wants their kids in the images to maintain their image because \"no one will know they are there\". They don't care if *you* can't post your own wedding photos of the reception, vows, dance, any tradition. They literally just want the optics of being at your wedding. *They don't care about you*. This isn't *just* the family picture, this is your entire wedding day you will have to triple check being posted of a main family member but they'll he able to post *their darling sisters wedding* with everyone else. \n\n\nYou have several options: 1.) tell the photographer to avoid images of her children entierly- not a single one, they cant feel hurt if they're not in a single one. 2.) Do the separate family one you can post, tell them this is how it's going to be and if they don't like it they can just not come 3.) Have them photoshopped out of any and all images (kids placed on the sides where they can easily be removed, this will cost more) 4.) Never post your wedding photos to keep the miserable witch and her equally miserable husband happy 5.) Uninvite them and save costs.\n\n\nI have a cousin who couldn't be posted on social media and at big events like weddings the photographer was always paid extra to avoid the kid and photoshop her out, that was for legal reasons. No one posted her, period. Telling one sibling they can't post their own wedding images while everyone else can is pointedly rude and cruel.", "NTA and honestly I really respect you. I hate having my kids posted online and would so appreciate you doing this for me \ud83d\udc9c", "NTA, you do what you think is the best, your brother is an AH. I would desinvite him lol.", "NTA.  Have you asked your SIL why your other siblings are allowed to post the kids, but you aren't?  There's something going on if it's only you that is not allowed to post pics of the kids.", "Yes. This is the solution. Rather than bend over backwards to try to accommodate them by having everyone else involved pose for twice as many pictures to have with and without versions, do not require them to be in any of the professional pictures.\n\nNothing OP does will satisfy bro and sil, so do what is best for the bride and groom.\n\n\"We are posting our professional wedding pictures online. You will not be required to be in them to preserve your \"no internet\" boundary.\" They get to determine THEIR boundaries and behavior, not other people's.", "Honest question then: what do you think the right thing to do is?", "/u/MundaneChand749 is a bot that copied part of [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153v5eg/aita_for_doing_different_photos_on_my_wedding_day/jsl7yjm/)", "appeasing a controlling asshole isn't a solution, it's allowing them to walk over you.", "So, she just doesn't want you to have any wedding photos? Why does she hate you so much. She's trying to make her wedding all about you. I would just uninvited her entirely.", "Exactly", "Just leave them out of the photos then. They can\u2019t enforce their boundaries on you and your wedding. If they don\u2019t want to be part of photos shared on social media they will have to stay out of the photos. Simple as that. The fact that it\u2019s just you in your family that isn\u2019t allowed to share photos of them is such a weird thing to begin with that I would just ignore everything they say after that, they\u2019re being weird and irrational and exhausting. NTA.", "So you're just not allowed to distribute any images of your wedding because you're half siblings and half siblings aren't real family and cant show images of her kids? \nShe only cares about the image. She doesn't want it to *look* like she treats you and your family any differently, but she does. She doesn't want you to have images of her kids, she doesn't want you to display them because they aren't your family. She will probably throw a snit if you display your wedding photos and demand you not show them.\n\n\nI'd take one family image with her, your half brother, and their kids and ask them to step aside for those who truly want to be apart of your family. I wouldn't even give her the professional images, I'd tell her too bad so sad. NTA"]}
