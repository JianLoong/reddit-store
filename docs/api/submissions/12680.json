Worry about \u201closing pregnancy weight\u201d once kiddo is smearing rice cereal in their hair.", "If you\u2019re breastfeeding you *are* still eating for 2, you\u2019re feeding your baby the same as you were before birth, except now they\u2019re even bigger and hungrier! You need about 500 cals extra a day to feed your baby. Your body isn\u2019t trying to trick you, you feel hungry because you *are* hungry", "Totally reasonable and natural, OP.  But even if you weren't breastfeeding, it's none of her business.  That is insanely intrusive.\n\nOh, and it's not even like you added some fried chicken, you added a *boiled egg*.", "So you are still eating for two then, breast milk doesn\u2019t just appear out of thin air. I would say that the next time someone brings it up.", "Protein!! You were right on with the eggs.", "Get you some chocolate and oatmeal, and drink water as your baby feeds or as you pump. You'll be a fountain. It was so fascinating to me how I could strap on my pump and start chugging a bottle of water and almost *feel* the water passing through me and out my boobs.", "Honey, you are still eating for two.  Eat what you need to and make sure that baby gets plump and healthy.  NTA and tell the people who roll their eyes the doctor told you it was fine.", "Depends on how much the baby is eating. Breastfeeding hunger is insane and restricting calories can cause a person to stop producing milk. People who are breastfeeding are not candidates for calorie restriction. I was told this by a dietitian.", "Everyone is different. I gained 70 pounds while pregnant. I was hungry all the time after giving birth. Ate more while breastfeeding than pregnant and was back to pre pregnancy weight in 6 months. I think I used significantly more than 350-400 calories daily while breastfeeding. Hormones are wild.", "I mean, it's more than you need even in the third trimester.", "It is not that cut and dry. When I was breastfeeding both times I was eating easily double my normal calories, way more than even when I was pregnant, and the skinniest I\u2019ve ever been in my life. I looked like a skeleton, and that was with me eating protein bars while nursing in the middle of the night and eating all day long. I was insatiable and craved protein and fat like never in my life.", "Please get some space from her - she came over for breakfast and lunch???  Why does this woman think its okay to berate a new mother?  You are so NTA, but I am getting increasingly annoyed with your husband for not protecting you from her.", "Why is she so rude and obsessed with what you\u2019re eating??? I think it\u2019s time to stop inviting her over.", "Tell her to stuff a sock in it and that your body and health is not her business.", "Why is she so fixated on what you eat? That would piss me off, she needs to keep her unasked for opinions to herself.", "She needs to spend less time in your life.  Put a calorie tracker app on your phone and tell your SIL you\u2019re firing her from the role you never hired her for.", "Tell her to mind her own damn business", "Eat what you need to eat. Be sure to take a calcium supplement with your vitamins. Calcium citrate doesn't have to be taken with meals, other calcium supplements do. If you're eating a well balanced diet for a breastfeeding mother, with the appropriate amount of calories and nutrients, including fats, that you need to feed your baby, then you just need to tell SIL thanks for the help but you're following your doctor's nutrition guidance.", "Because I made a mistake lol.", "Thanks, that makes me feel better. I want to eat cheese all the time! I hate not eating when I'm hungry.", "Seconded.  So much hungrier.  You actually need more calories breastfeeding too.", "This! Also, that range seems low to me - milk has to be produced after all, it's not just regurgitation. Plus, it's baby's only food source, and they're growing *constantly*.", "I used a lot of calories while breastfeeding, one kid constantly fed and the other fed a lot at once. I ended up gaining weight rather than losing despite not increasing my calories a lot because my thyroid went wonky. Its crazy how different everyone can be. OP should stop contact with her toxic AF sister in law", "She comes over a lot to help us with cleaning and laundry, because it's hard to keep up with everything with the baby. So I'm really grateful to her. It's part of why I feel bad for not doing the one thing she's asking me to do.", "Next time sil bugs you remind her you need calories to run your body plus extra calories for your body to make food for the baby. Hopefully saying it that simply will cut through her ignorance so she can comprehend the situation.", "You need the fat, protein, and calcium. If you don\u2019t take in enough calcium your body will literally leech it from your bones to make milk. As I commented separately, you need 500-1000 extra calories a day to breastfeed. Listen to your body, girl, and eat that cheese!\n\nI\u2019ve been breastfeeding for 18 months and it\u2019s STILL increasing my appetite, even though my baby has obviously been eating solids for a year now.", "In addition to breastfeeding, your body just went through something HUGE. You are still recovering. If it wants food, listen. Weight loss should really not be the first priority after giving birth, and it's mostly just our fucked culture that makes people think it should. You're not gonna change your SIL's mind about this, probably - that comment about your height and who will gain more weight sounds like an ugly kind of competitive mind game to me, or at best some projection of her own body image problems - but you don't have to let her try to put you on a diet. If at some point you decide you'd like to lose weight, you can worry about that then. You have more than enough to handle as it is.\n\nNTA", "Your SIL is frankly full of shit.", "Your family is WAY too involved in your eating habits. It\u2019s none of their business! NTA", "My go to breastfeeding snack was a tortilla with peanut butter and Nutella. If I didn't have Nutella I would put chocolate syrup on the peanut butter. When I was done breastfeeding I never craved that again.", "I\u2019m currently breastfeeding. Lost half my pregnancy weight immediately after birth and then gained about ten back. Baby is 6 months old and I finally feel like I\u2019m a little less hungry. Any time I tried cutting calories my supply would decrease. The stress they are going to cause you could decrease your supply too. They are so fucking rude for even commenting on it. You need to tell your husband he can step up and shit his family down or his family can stay away until you are at a weight they seem acceptable", "Not to mention, you're 8 weeks out from a day when your body did this nifty party trick where it abruptly detached something that had been connected by a major blood vessel, which it then closed off and rerouted.  You're still in the third trimester.  Your body is also using calories to repair itself.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning your caloric needs if you had surgery.", "It's very good for bone, skin health, and connective tissue to have healthy fats, especially when breast feeding and rebounding from child birth. Your sil sounds nuts and should mind her own business.", "Cheese all the time probably isn't healthy, but do make sure you're getting enough calcium and consuming the calories you need. Pregnancy and nursing will take it from your bones and give you osteoporosis if you're not getting enough through other sources. Might be worth speaking to you OB about.", "Grazing, protein bars, a spoonful of peanut butter. And it's really, really easy to make cheese crackers- with just cheese. If your hungry, have a little something. Waiting for mealtime can make you over eat.", "You don't need Shame Blankets thrown on you.  Her assistance is undoubtedly very important, but it doesn't give her license to demand anything about your body.  EVER.  Best of luck to you.  I can't imagine how stressed out you feel right now but take care of yourself and your emotional needs.  When she makes nasty comments perfect the art of the Nod and Blank Stare.", "She is way too invested in your body and what you eat. Adding eggs and cheese to the salad was exactly right. You need the calcium and protein to make milk. And drink lots of water. \n\nYou're doing great!", "It doesn\u2019t give her any right to make comment on your food, or how much you\u2019re eating.", "Why is she obsessed with your weight? Why does she even have opinions about your post baby body? If she\u2019s worried you\u2019ll get fat, why? You won\u2019t represent the family well? She\u2019s worried about her brother\u2019s boner? It\u2019s so weird.", "This is absolutely correct!! You need those extra calories from protein, fat, and calcium for your baby\u2019s healthy growth.", "Only about 350-400 extra cals are recommended for breastfeeding mothers.", "That sounds really yummy...", "Me but instead I cut up a tortilla into triangles and smeared melted butter on it and then coated it in cinnamon sugar and baked it and it turned into chips", "Cheese is fine.", "Recommended and what an individual actually needs are different things", "Oh it was so good at 2 am after a pumping session before going back to bed.", "Everything is fine in moderation"]}
