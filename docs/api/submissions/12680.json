Hungry. All. The. Time. I felt so bad whenever I would eat with my first because I wasn\u2019t \u201cbouncing back\u201d to my pre pregnancy body as quickly as other people and media had led me to believe. Finally after about 3 months of hating myself for feeding my kid with my first, I said f-it and ate when I was hungry and what I wanted (I eat pretty healthy regardless so it\u2019s not like I was snacking on cookies and ice cream or anything like that). Felt totally normal and would just ignore if someone (typically extended family, aunts/cousins/etc.) asked me if I was sure I needed another serving. I didn\u2019t gain more weight (stayed right around 150/155lb when my prepregnancy weight was about 140) and held onto that little bit of pregnancy weight until my kids were done breastfeeding entirely (about 2 years old for both of them). My third is still currently breastfeeding. My weight is still sitting right around 150/155 and I still don\u2019t give a flip when people ask me if I really need to eat more. I do struggle sometimes with the number itself, but my husband and I have been pursuing a healthier (more exercise as we do eat pretty healthy already) lifestyle and if the weight comes off, it comes off and if it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t until my baby is done breastfeeding. I would rather my child be fed than fit some weird norm that never should have been started in the first place. As long as you\u2019re choosing healthy foods and not cookies/ice cream/cake/etc most of the time, it\u2019s ok to eat when you\u2019re hungry unless your OB has stated otherwise.

And you need to eat more nutrients and less stress as it can effect milk production", "Others have covered this but you need a ton more calories to breastfeed. A 2 month old can be consuming 20-30oz a day which is 400-600 calories.

Believing your body is \u201ctricking\u201d you, or that every calorie consumed must be justified, can be a gateway to disordered eating.
