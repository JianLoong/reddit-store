My sister was throwing up almost every day for the first 18 weeks. I definitely didn't envy her.\n\nMy husband got annoyed a couple times because we'd order food that I thought I wanted until it was in front of me and then I couldn't make myself eat it.", "Actually, that is a general guide. It varies by each person,  their most makeup,  the baby,  if the baby is going thru a growth spurt, etc...\n\nHealth professionals would use a [calculator](https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator) to determine how much extra is needed on a case by case basis. \n\nThere is no one size fits all when it comes to pregnancy/labor or breastfeeding.", ">[Exclusive](https://www.parents.com/baby/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-and-calories-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) breastfeeding typically burns about 500-700 calories per day.", "That, uh, that's a completely different person who said anything about mansplaining, but keep on lashing out blindly at anyone and everyone, I guess, and make up strawman arguments about how \"postpartum women [...] need to be stuffing down cheeseburgers\".", "Or husband is complaining to the sister about his wife's body, and sister thinks she's \"helping\".", "Sorry, you're right. I biffed the conversion.", "Sure. And there is no evidence that OP is anyone falling outside the general guidelines. Everyone is posting items like \"thats just a guideline!!!!\" but always assuming that she should be eating more than the recommended. She could also be recommended to eat less than the guidelines. But I guess any attempt to advise people of appropriate calorie counts just ends in a bunch of butthurt people.", "Oh. [parents.com](https://parents.com). Truly a peer reviewed source.", "My mom had this problem with me, I was quite early, so I was very tiny. Which led to everything being too big. My grandma ended up making me stuff that would fit. Before that happened, though, my parents wanted to get professional photos of me when I was released from the hospital, for keep sakes and also to send to relatives. We had to go to a big mall a ways away to get them done, my mom thought since it was a big mall surely we could find baby clothes that would fit and also be cute for photos. She was wrong. Nothing was small enough. My grandma came up with an interesting solution. She went and bought a doll, took off the clothes, and put them on me. It worked, and it was a funny story that my grandma loved telling when she was alive.", ">says Kecia Gaither, M.D., who is double board-certified in OB-GYN and Maternal Fetal Medicine.\n\nIt's not like [Parents.com](https://Parents.com) pulled it out of their ass or asked their random employee their opinion, lol. And this isn't the only source for that information. Google it and you'll find many more, including many that have been linked here, and are peer reviewed. The NIH also gives a range of calories, exceeding the range in the link you provided.\n\nActing as if every mother out there only burns \\~300-400 calories max by breastfeeding is ridiculous and not supported by any scientific studies."]}
