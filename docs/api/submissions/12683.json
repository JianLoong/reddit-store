It's not my style but my sister loves red. Anyway, I told her it's too bright but she told me that I'm allowed to not like a colour but she likes the dress.

Anyway, I did but as soon as I said that, she became a bit withdrawn from the conversation and replied with single word answers. I asked her if she didn't like what I said and she agreed, saying that by constantly telling her the dress would look bad on her (I never said that) I was making her feel insecure especially since she already bought the dress. I told her that I never told her that the dress wouldn't look good on her and that I only think the colour is too bright and doesn't suit her. She told me that I'm allowed to not like the colour but she does and that she too doesn't like the colour of the decorations I've picked our for my wedding but she isn't going around telling me this. So now I'm wondering whether I was wrong for honestly saying my opinion on her dress? AITA?\n\nFor context, we are not American so dress colours do not matter in weddings for us.

I just feel that the colour she chose is too bright.\n\nAlso, I was advised to post a pic but idk how to do that so I'll just describe it instead.

What was the point of repeatedly telling her how much you hate the color? \n\nIf you indeed mean to be helpful, apologize to her, and for god's sake, stop shoving your opinion down her throat.

If it\u2019s super inappropriate (her boobs are falling out of it, or something), that\u2019s one thing, but to ruin it for her because YOU don\u2019t like it??! When my ex husband and I were engaged, his mom bought an outfit for our wedding that she was REALLY excited about.  She showed it to me, and it was NOT my taste.  In fact, I thought it was downright ugly.  But, it was appropriate for the occasion, I just personally didn\u2019t like it.  What I said to her was, \u201cthat\u2019s awesome, Kathy!  I\u2019m so glad you found something you love!\u201d  My ex told her it made her look like a hobo, completely ruining it for her.

I mean, I've said that the colour would be hard to pull of by anyone of any skin colour so it's not about my sister being dark skinned. \n\nAnd the colour is literally (as I've been saying in other comments) that of a traffic stop sign. \n\nI know it might be hard to believe but I'm pressing about the colour because I feel like it's the only thing \"wrong\" about her dress. I have no other issues, the design is pretty. But by saying that the red doesn't suit her, I seem to have offended her. But it was just my honest opinion and I don't want her to look bad on that day since she's looking forward to it so much", "Well she already bought this one so why would you keep harping on the color?", "Wow. My advice to her is go lc or nc with a sib who shames her  like this", "when you were shopping, did you suggest other red dresses for her to try on and give positive feedback on those? \n\ni might be reading into it and you did say you arent american, so idk in america it it typically a bit taboo (unless the married couple directs otherwise) to wear overly flashy/bold things to a wedding that could \"distract\" from the bride. \n\nfrom you saying she stands out, i wonder if that is subconsciously the issue. i mean theres nothing wrong with that, as it is your wedding, but i think the issue stands with it seeming like you said she could wear whatever she wants, and then negatively commenting on her choice. \n\nshe already bought the dress which you knew, so it just seems really unnecessary to make comments like that. if shes happy and comfortable, thats all that should matter. if in ten years you look back on pictures and she says she shouldve worn a different dress then laugh about it! idk its such a minor, minuscule problem in the grand scheme of things. \n\nit always amazes me how weird weddings make people on both sides. if youre marrying the love of your life, you should be so happy and focused on that, that what your sister wears wont matter at all. just dont put her down.\n\nfrom a little sister pov with a similar age gap as you and your sister, i love my sister to death, but her words hold so much power over me. if she wants to be mean, she can destroy my confidence in like 5 seconds. i know this is semi a \"me problem\" but i just really value her opinion. if i felt like i looked really good in something, told her i felt pretty (which after 22 years of life and attending fashion school, i think i have a fairly decent grasp on dressing myself) i would be so sad if she said i looked bad.", "These types of comments are why I never go shopping with my sister.

She liked this dress as soon as she laid her eyes on it and other dresses she tried on (weren't red) weren't her size so she couldn't get them. \n\nThe weddings we have over here are kinda over the top and guests wear somewhat extravagant clothing. So I don't really have the notion of attention not being on me and especially not because of my sister because her dress is really simple for this type of wedding. \n\nI can see what you're saying. We had a similar situation back when she cut her hair. Back then she refused to listen when I told her her haircut didn't look good but now she agrees with me that it in fact didn't look good and that she knew it but was just putting on a strong front because the deed was done.
