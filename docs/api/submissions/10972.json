It's your father's business, and he gave it to the person most likely to carry on the legacy.  Would your stepbrother have been just as pissed if your father had sold it to a stranger?", "NTA, your father can give it to whoever he wants, the step brother isn\u2019t entitled to it. Sounds like you were kinda aggressive when telling him to get over it, but it depends on how your family talks to each other ya know", "NTA, your father can give his business to whoever he thinks will do it best.

How old is stepbrother? Edit NTA", "NTA\nYour stepbrother had his chance.", "I mean, NTA, but also not your business. If your brother is going to be a brat about this, there's probably nothing you can say (as someone not involved in any way) to change that.", "Quick question - is your stepbrother your father's only bio son? \n\nIf thats the case it could be that your stepbrother feels like he's been pushed out of his own family, or he began feeling like an outsider around his dad. Just because you and your bio siblings have been happy with the new family dynamic doesn't mean your stepbrother feels the same.", "ESH, you and your stepbrother both suck.\n\nAny conflict here would be between your stepbrother and his/your (step)father.

I guess your stepbrother can't handle hearing the truth :) Too bad for him. Because he is the only one who screwed himself over by doing such shoddy work for your SD.

The point is that he failed to do the job well or to take responsibility. It would more meaningful to point out that he had a chance and wasted it.", "NTA, it's your step dads choice.", "NTA", "NTA.

Your step brother is being a jerk and harming your dad\u2019s health more by causing him stress. Good on you for stepping up.", "YTA. He has every right to be pissed off just as your step dad has every right to give his business to someone else. There is no one on earth who's going to watch their birthright be given away and not have a negative reaction to it. This decision will most likely cost your step dad his relationship with his (bio) son, which I'm sure he is very aware of. Its a big fuking decision with big (life long) consequences.

Just because his dad built the business doesn\u2019t mean step brother has some automatic right to it. Give your head a shake."]}
