I'm giving your ex benefit of the doubt that she saw and recognized the problems with how the cat was being treated which is *why* she asked you to look after it. And that she hasn't asked for the cat *before* now because she knew those problems would occur again. So that means her asking *now* is acknowledgement that the problems *won't* happen again.\n\nAnd considering she was already struggling to find housing for herself, it seems totally fair to understand she, *at that time*, had trouble finding housing for her cat.\n\nYou on the other hand are basically lording her mistakes (that she seemingly has already acknowledged), over her, months later.\n\nWhen you found out the cat was mistreated, you 'swore to yourself' rather than communicate with her that you had changed your mind and were going to keep the cat.\n\nWhat makes you think that when *she* realized the cat was getting mistreated, *she* didn't *also* swear to herself to make sure it didn't happen again, and letting you take care of it *was her way of doing that*?\n\nHeck, she probably increased her own difficulty in getting a place because she was very likely trying to make sure whatever place she got would *let her have her cat*. If all along you had no intention of giving it back, not factoring the cat into her place-finding would probably have made it a lot easier for her to find a place to begin with and it wouldn't have taken so long. So you quite likely indirectly impacted her living situation all this time, too.\n\nIf I did rule on this I doubt you'd like my ruling.\n\nIf you want to fight this, take it to court and let them decide once both parties have had their say. That's what court is *for*.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo THIS is how much your promise is worth: NOTHING.  YOU Are the AH here.", "NTA.

Keep Rocky, pet him, give him a lot of love and protect him from your irresponsable ex.", "ESH\n\nShe shouldn't have let the situation with the cat go as long as she did. You are right not to give the cat back. That situation was absolutely neglectful and a bit abusive. However it clearly it wasn't malicious and she worked to resolve the situation. \nThe reason you suck is for being cold about her asking for it back and condescending to her about her ability to care for herself. Sounds bitter. You can or could have said no and made a clear boundary without that nastiness.\n\nGood on you for keeping the cat definitely your cat now. You've bonded more, taken it from a bad situation and it's your cat \n\nThat said, She probably had some hard times and lessons over the past year.

Animals are considered property and that agreement is usually done in court. I guess she could sue me in small claims court. Even more complicated is she now lives in another state.", "The main reason I'm keeping him is she still isn't squared away with her living situation. She has bounced between 3-5 different places over the period of a year and is getting ready to move to another state again. Keeping an animal, especially a cat, requires stability and she hasn't proven to be stable at anything.\n\nIf she had me keep him for a few months, got her own place, and was living there the whole time, then I would have no problems giving him back.", "[https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/pet-custody.html](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/pet-custody.html)\n\nI was thinking more that *you* would sue *her* for ownership of the cat.\n\nThat way if she does something like, try to steal it, then you'd have grounds to stand on. The whole saying 'possession is 9 tenths of the law' thing. Right now the cat's in your possession. Would make sense to take advantage of that.\n\nBut, I can see from your point of view of it not being worth the hassle if there's no realistic threat of any action from her part. I do think sitting back and making *her* sue *you* is a dick move, though.\n\nOffering it to the court to decide is fair and rational and shows proper respect to whoever the true owner of the cat is determined to be by the court; it's also fair to her by giving her a reason she's denied her cat other than your and only your opinion.\n\nDeciding that you'll just keep the cat unless *she* sues for it (and wins) is far more one-sided and selfish. At the very least, give her the idea as a form of compromise. \"So sue me.\" If she doesn't take you up on it, then it's on her.\n\nOn the other hand if she *does* take you up on it maybe that will convince you that she actually wants this cat and wants to treat it right. Who knows.", "You also said you swore to yourself the cat would never go back. Sounds like you need to just be straight and stop pretending you'll ever give it back.", "Yes, once I found out he was inside of a cage for two days without a litter box.

I would say allow get to have visitation rights.", "EDIT I saw in one of OPs comments the chip is in his name so ignore the 2nd paragraph. \n\nNTA. She already broke the agreement by changing it from 1 or 2 months to over a year. That is important because after a solid year in a stable home I doubt the cat is \"more attached to her\" anymore. At the very least not so attached that it wants to move homes - being rehomed can be so stressful for older cats especially that it outright kills them, they literally get depression and refuse to eat.\n\nLegally I have no idea what the potential pitfalls would be but given your ex's financial situation I sincerely doubt she has the money to blow on lawyering up over a cat she almost certainly cannot prove is hers. On that note though I'd make sure you've got your name attached to this cat in writing. Vet documents are the easiest go to, and if the cats not already chipped then that's one of the best ways to prove ownership.", "Nta\n\nGet him microchipped in your name, get documentation at the vets to show he is yours (if you haven\u2019t already), and maybe near February get some pet friendly fur dye and give him a very noticeable colored spots.

A scenario in which she instantly says \"dude you're no longer allowed to watch my cat\" the second she found out that the 'friend' had been locking it in a spare bedroom around the clock is completely plausible and fits all the details provided by the OP.\n\nShould she maybe have been more aware and involved in how her cat was being treated? Sure, you could argue that. But she had a lot on her plate, y'know, *being homeless and all*, and is it a crime to trust your friend?\n\nThis is where 'benefit of the doubt' is coming in. I can't say for sure that this is what happened or not.\n\nHence the point of using court to actually sort out all those details, get her side of the story and everything.", "That's a fair take, but in that case, yes she should have been more aware of how her cat was being treated.\n\nI get that she had a lot on her plate, but that doesn't justify animal abuse, knowing or not.", "If you literally don't know it's happening then I don't know what you expect her to do about it.\n\nShe trusted her friend.\n\nShe's trusting the OP now.\n\nWhat's the difference? Heck, for all she knows the OP is just as abusive. He won't even let her have the cat back! What if it's dead and this is just his excuse? (From her point of view.)\n\nAnd so on and so forth. Can do hypotheticals all day. Point is the benefit of the doubt is there. There's enough plausible hypotheticals, at least until further details come to light to rule some/all of them out.\n\nWhich is what court is for. Actual pet custody court matters more here than the court of public reddit AITA popularity.\n\nNot to mention another big key point:\n\n*People learn lessons*. I care less about proving she ever did abuse it than I do about proving she *will* abuse it. And yes, one is very much related to the other but they're still different enough to not be exactly the same thing. How she reacted to the abuse that did occur definitely matters.\n\nThat lesson of \"I should check in more often than once every several weeks\" *may have already been learned*. Or perhaps the lesson is \"Find a more trustworthy person to watch the cat.\" Who knows? Details to sort out in court.\n\nEven abusive parents often are given another chance after they've 'done their time' and such.\n\nAt the end of the day OP is arbitrarily deciding to arbitrate. If he feels he's so justified in his decision, he should prove it in pet custody court.", "Perhaps you could get an agreement whereby if she lives in a stable situation for a year, she'll get another chance with Rocky?

It's a good idea to explore, but please don't give people legal advice without basis.", "Again as I said before, the issue isn't the fact that you're keeping the cat that's the right thing to do most definitely.
