Would make sense to take advantage of that.\n\nBut, I can see from your point of view of it not being worth the hassle if there's no realistic threat of any action from her part. I do think sitting back and making *her* sue *you* is a dick move, though.\n\nOffering it to the court to decide is fair and rational and shows proper respect to whoever the true owner of the cat is determined to be by the court; it's also fair to her by giving her a reason she's denied her cat other than your and only your opinion.\n\nDeciding that you'll just keep the cat unless *she* sues for it (and wins) is far more one-sided and selfish. At the very least, give her the idea as a form of compromise. \"So sue me.\" If she doesn't take you up on it, then it's on her.\n\nOn the other hand if she *does* take you up on it maybe that will convince you that she actually wants this cat and wants to treat it right.

A scenario in which she instantly says \"dude you're no longer allowed to watch my cat\" the second she found out that the 'friend' had been locking it in a spare bedroom around the clock is completely plausible and fits all the details provided by the OP.\n\nShould she maybe have been more aware and involved in how her cat was being treated? Sure, you could argue that. But she had a lot on her plate, y'know, *being homeless and all*, and is it a crime to trust your friend?\n\nThis is where 'benefit of the doubt' is coming in.

I care less about proving she ever did abuse it than I do about proving she *will* abuse it.

Or perhaps the lesson is \"Find a more trustworthy person to watch the cat.\" Who knows? Details to sort out in court.\n\nEven abusive parents often are given another chance after they've 'done their time' and such.\n\nAt the end of the day OP is arbitrarily deciding to arbitrate.

They help them to keep focused as they have someone to care for, preventing them from falling in the rabbit hole. I have a really close family member who owns a husky and I care for her when he's working and such, although I don't agree with their living arrangements, I know if I kept it from him he would go to the deep end as she's his entire reason to stay focused. In your case I would've facilitated a leash for her to walk the cat and any other thing she needed, like pet sitting and such, taking the cat from her was just plain mean. Cats can be locked in a spare room if they have all what they need. I have a cat room for 2 of mine  where they have everything available to them. I see this post most about control than anything else as I read she has a new place today and you still aren't giving her the opportunity to prove she's responsible and are hanging on what happened a year ago when she was at her lowest.", "NTA.\n\nFirst off, the original agreement was for you to take the cat for a couple months -  not over a year. After that long, she is no longer the owner. No doubt in that time you've taken him to the vet for annual shots  because it's just been that long.\n\nOn top of that, she was an abusive pet owner. She can get herself a chia pet for now and see how that goes. Work her way up to a spider plant and sea monkeys. Maybe in time she will be worthy of a carnival goldfish. But never Rocky.

She abandoned her property and it's not hers anymore.", "> My ex called me and asked me if I could keep him on a temporary basis until she found more permanent housing. \n\nIt entirely depends on what they agreed on. Assuming abandonment, pretty basic googling indicates that some states are as low as a week, and some states are up to a year --- which would be counting from after their agreement, however specific it was. There are states with specific laws about pets/animals. There's also an argument to be made that this violates some states criminal code's for pet abandonment ---- which is all to say, it is very ridiculous to try to make a point that something is a universal law, when the United States itself has 50 state legal codes to consider and the world's a hell of a lot bigger than that.", "HAPPY BABIES FRIENDS FOR LIFE!!!"]}
