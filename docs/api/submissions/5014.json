Said I wasn't fit to be a father due to an opioid addiction. I'd been in a wreck that caused severe spinal damage/pain and formed a habit that I'll admit took me a lot longer to kick than I'm proud of. She was never in any way supportive on that particular subject, but her leaving me over it was out of the blue. Courts said custody would be 50/50 and it has been since.\n\nIn that decade I've done okay, remarried a wonderful woman who I've had 2 girls with and was promoted into a position with a 7 figure salary. My ex has not done well, she's remarried twice and was broken up with both times. Filed bankruptcy, lives in what I can only describe as a shit hole apartment.\n\nI make sure my son is well taken care of, my wife, girls and I spend every moment we're legally entitled to spend with him and we offer to include him in quite literally everything, which is mother frequently declines when it's on \"her time\". My son and ex both know as well that if he needs anything he can call and ask, I've sent food/clothing/etc. frequently and several times put them both up in a hotel because their apartment was being fumigated or similar.\n\nBoth my parents, my ex's parents, my sister and of course my ex feel I should be financially supporting my ex. Their reasoning is that my son stays with her half the time, she's the mother of my son, during those times he's with her they're both living in squalor and my son gets upset every time he has to go with his mother who he's started saying he \"hates\" as of late. When she tells him she won't feed him because it's expensive and to call me because I have money - it's no small wonder. So far as I'm aware she can afford to feed him, she's working two jobs, but she'd rather I pay his expenses so she can afford expensive shoes in addition to the minimum payment on her maxed out credit cards. (I've tried to get sole custody, the courts made it clear that short of her murdering several people that's not happening.) I've held my ground thus far, as I feel I've no responsibility for her and I've no desire to support her using my son against me for her own financial gain which is exactly what she's doing.
