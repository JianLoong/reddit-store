That can mean a lot of things to different people... and when CPS is concerned. If I was making a post about my child apparently living in squalor, I'd be making ***points*** about it. I had to help my partner out of a toxic, financially-abusive  household that **was** living in squalor - his mom smoked a pack of cigs a day, started hoarding like 20+ unfixed cats on top of 3 dogs, and wouldn't clean up after them... and my partner could only do so much about the cleaning (and what he was aware of!) since he was a full time college student and working part time (and, at one point, in a full-time unpaid internship).  The landlord also refused to do any repairs on the house for years (before the weird animal hoarding thing, for what it is worth), so the basement was full of black mold and the entire houses' structure was warped beyond belief by the time she had to pack up after getting evicted. \n\nThey would also have heating issues because his mom wouldn't pay the heat bill during the winter so the electric company couldn't legally cut them off... so when it was time to turn the heat back on, it would be over a thousand dollars to pay...\n\nI ***know*** squalor. Like, *actual* squalor. I also know about poor households and someone can have a Not Nice Household but it can still be clean. It might look terrible and it might be extremely outdated, with really old amenities, but if it all works and doesn't pose a safety concern... it's not squalor. \n\n CPS *can* drop the ball so I won't discount that, but supposedly:\n\n\\-he has taken ex to court enough about supposed neglect and since he does not have 'overwhelming' evidence of neglect, he'll now be considered *harassing* her,\n\n\\-she has had her house (which I am guessing is a rental and not in a great area, based on comments about her 'losing the house' some time after her divorce)\n\nI wonder if OP isn't describing what 'squalor' is because his ex lives in or near an improvised part of town, in a rental, that whist it may not be filthy or in extreme disrepair (eg, things she **can** control), but it may occasionally have issues with bugs due to location. This is something a lot of people, sadly, have to deal with... If you live near filthy houses or fooderies, it's super easy to get infestations... especially when the infested places get fumigated and, surprise surprise, the bugs move somewhere else nearby. So it may be less actual squalor as much of him being a absolute jerk because she's poor and can't afford as nice of a place. \n\nAs long as she's dealing with it when issues arise, I cannot imagine CPS would consider that neglect insofar as the house itself is still considered 'livable.'
