She doesn\u2019t know she can take him back to court. She 100% should.", "right I love how he just glosses over it was out of the blue for his partner to leave with a small child when he was addicted to hard drugs. like ummm no that\u2019s pretty much what any decent parent does in that situation", "maybe you misssed the part where HISA parents think so too. something is fishy with this storyzz", "I like the condo idea. And put it jointly in OP\u2019s name and son\u2019s name, so she\u2019s out when he turns 18, and the next victim, er, husband has no standing.", "Someone else had a similar idea to the condo idea but the family got all upset when that OP held their ex to their agreement after they lived there for 15 years:\n\n[AITA for kicking my ex out of my house right before Christmas and suing her?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znr2kv/aita_for_kicking_my_ex_out_of_my_house_right/)", "Have you considered getting a lawyer for your son? Assuming you're in the US or another common law country, independent counsel for the child, and an assessment of his living conditions and psychological state, can be used in custody cases. But be prepared to be asked to pay child support to your ex to address the disparity in your son's \"two different lives\". To which you might want to agree, provided your ex offers regular proof that the money goes to his care, not her shoe rack.

The kid is now 11 and there are vastly different circumstances than when he was born. You make a lot more and the inequity on his quality of life between the homes is what child support is supposed to help with; so the child doesn\u2019t go without. You seem to still be bitter that she didn\u2019t want to stay with you and raise your child together when you admit you were an opioid addict. That you seem to feel it came out of the blue makes me think you really didn\u2019t have a grasp on what was really going on around you at the time. I\u2019m glad your circumstances have changed and it sounds like you are in recovery for your addiction. Your son needs to be taken care of. You can\u2019t have him full time, so another option is to make sure he\u2019s taken care of. Child support is supposed to assist with that and should be considered a bare minimum when there\u2019s such disparity between incomes", "Addiction is addiction. It\u2019s pointless to try to make a distinction because it\u2019s about the safety and welfare of a child.

How does he seem bitter?", "Thanks for this comment, I had to scroll way too far to find this. I hope OP listens to you. What a fucking asshole. He gets 50% custody even though he was an addict and now wants full custody instead of paying child support to make sure he has a good life, then comes on Reddit to bitch about it with half the story. YTA u/marsupialcurious8966", "If he gave the mom money, it would go to waste, and would never be enough. If it's his duty to supply the other custodial parent with housing, etc., the courts would order it.

Enough to know you shouldn't call people in the midst of a medical emergency 'junkies'.", "You don\u2019t know that. Every bitter ex that thinks like OP says shit like \u201cthey\u2019ll just spend it on expensive shoes.\u201d There should have already been a change of support order due to the ridiculously unbalanced incomes. This is exactly what support is for. But OP\u2019s kid\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t have the money to pay a lawyer to make that happen. Y\u2019all do realize that shit ain\u2019t free, right?\n\nOP should find a solution. And that\u2019s NOT using his money to highlight the discrepancy so that his kid chooses daddy warbucks over desolate mom. The kid won\u2019t hate him now, that\u2019ll come later when he realizes what OP did to \u201cwin\u201d (no one is winning here). If they have not cultivated a healthy coparent relationship that\u2019s on BOTH of them but OP has the power to make this an emotionally healthy childhood for his kid, or to choose pettiness. \n\nOP could pay for a home in a better neighborhood. That\u2019s not giving her extra money, that\u2019s providing shelter for his kid. OP could set up regular food deliveries. Will the mom then use her money to buy herself things? Possibly, but that\u2019s also ok. I\u2019m sure daddy warbucks buys himself many things. \n\nAll these aita where vitriol is spewed at whichever parental side over money & acts of petty vengeance are sad af. Until folks learn to not be selfish pricks & put the youth of this world\u2019s best interests first, y\u2019all will just continue raising an angry violent world. Who gives af who the ah is when kids are involved. Let go of your damn pride PARENTS and be a better parent than everything you\u2019ve been shown. \n\nBreak generational traumas instead of creating new ones. \n\nBut nah, folks downvote comments that prioritize the emotional & mental health of kids, & in turn their parents. Bc when you finally shed your pride & create a healthy coparent relationship w your kid\u2019s parent, you all win & so does society bc you\u2019ve stopped that generational trauma & raised emotionally healthy kids while also healing your own buried wounds.", "That was a figure of speech, because you\u2019re the one who brought up the hierarchy of acceptability wrt drug addiction."]}
