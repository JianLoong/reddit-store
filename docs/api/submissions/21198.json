I like that you doubled down on the flight attendant. I don't get why she thinks she can tell you your seat isn't yours.

They\u2019ll be fine.", "Why do some people feel so entitled? LOL \n\nNTA", "NTA 100%. I fly a lot and really appreciate those flights when I have a row to myself.", "NTA and I'd resort the attendant for trying to harass you to give up your seat and making you a pariah. I agree that either of them could have switched with somebody in one of their rows since they didn't want to spend the big bucks to choose to stay together.", "I'm curious what airline this was, as in my experience the crew is very particular about you staying in your assigned seat. Heck, it was actually an issue in a flight I was on very recently.\n\nAt any rate, NTA. Your seat is your seat. You paid for it and are under no obligation to give it away.", "NTA if you\u2019re flying together then pay to stay together.", "Nta", "NTA.  It would\u2019ve been nice to let them sit together, but nice means going past what is required to not be a jerk.  You\u2019re not required to be nice.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that neither of them could convince the middle seat next to them to trade for a window or an aisle, though - that\u2019s usually an easy sell.  I get that at least at first, they were trying to take your whole row for themselves and have a free seat between them, but once the flight attendant was offering that \u201ccompromise,\u201d someone should have realized that it would\u2019ve been easier to get the person next to one of them to trade a middle for an aisle or a window.", "NTA. Even though you didn\u2019t specifically pick that seat, it was chosen for you to sit in. As Stewie Griffin said \u201cyour poor planning does not constitute an emergency for me\u201d you paid for your ticket just as they paid for theirs.

Not a big A, because \"your seat is your seat\" and all, but it's common courtesy to let two people travel together if they've been separated, so long as the seat you get in return is no worse.

I really like having a window seat so I can watch the earth go past. Someone on the other side of the plane didn\u2019t like the light that was coming in so they complained to the attendant. The attendant asked if I would close my blind. Like, WTF?", "Exactly. I get why OP wanted to play the roulette in choosing the seat as she's single. If the couple wanted to travel together and were willing to harass OP to an extent to sit together then why didn't they just pick the seats next to each other? \n\nObviously the seats OP was put in were free, so they should have been able to select them with no problem, right?", "Yup. I\u2019m flying to Europe with my family in the fall. I paid extra so we could all sit next to each other. It\u2019s not rocket science.", "If I'm understanding and visualizing this correctly, it was something like this:\n\nRow 12 \nSeat A empty \nSeat B OP\nSeat C empty\n\nRow 9\nSeat A girlfriend\nSeat B stranger to everyone irrelevant other than occupying a seat\nSeat C boyfriend\n\nBoyfriend asks OP to switch seats so he can sit with his girlfriend. OP would be in row 9 C girlfriend and and boyfriend would then have row 12 seats A-C to themselves. OP says no. Boyfriend repeats the request but this time OP would switch with the girlfriend.\n\nBoth of those scenarios result in boyfriend and girlfriend sitting in a row by themselves and OP sitting next to a stranger and giving up a middle seat. \n\nThe FA's compromise was to have OP move to either to seat A or C so the boyfriend and girlfriend could sit next to each other in his row instead of switching with the person in the middle seat in their assigned row. Which now results in the person in Row 9 seat B having a row to themselves.\n\nI'm going to assume the stranger in 9B refused to switch because if they had, boyfriend and girlfriend would already be next to each other in that row. So it's likely they wouldn't want to move from the middle if OP joins their row.\n\nThe person sitting in the middle of the bf & gf is the only person who should have been asked to move. Once they said no, that's it. How many other people should be asked? Why would the FA ask the OP to move to the window but not the person the bf/gf was sitting next to?", "That's surprising, Ryanair have an almost pathological corporate reluctance to do anything that might make their customer's flight more comfortable unless the customer pays for it.\n\nUnless I misunderstood a satirical news article, weren't they at one point toying with the idea of charging a euro to use the toilet?", "It\u2019s always Ryanair\u2026", "That's like entering a raffle and winning a toaster, then going up to the guy who won a car and asking them to trade, because, hey, you all paid the same and they're still getting a prize, right?", "But what about the guy in the row the couple was originally sitting in? If OP moves to the window and lets the couple sit next to each other, someone else now has a row to themselves. \n\nThere's 4 people and 3 of them want middle seats. Why should either of the 2 people who were assigned middle seats give that up to a 3rd person?", "Famous for landing at the wrong airport. In the wrong country."]}
