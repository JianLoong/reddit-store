The attendant asked if I would close my blind. Like, WTF?", "Exactly. I get why OP wanted to play the roulette in choosing the seat as she's single.

OP would be in row 9 C girlfriend and and boyfriend would then have row 12 seats A-C to themselves. OP says no. Boyfriend repeats the request but this time OP would switch with the girlfriend.\n\nBoth of those scenarios result in boyfriend and girlfriend sitting in a row by themselves and OP sitting next to a stranger and giving up a middle seat. \n\nThe FA's compromise was to have OP move to either to seat A or C so the boyfriend and girlfriend could sit next to each other in his row instead of switching with the person in the middle seat in their assigned row. Which now results in the person in Row 9 seat B having a row to themselves.\n\nI'm going to assume the stranger in 9B refused to switch because if they had, boyfriend and girlfriend would already be next to each other in that row. So it's likely they wouldn't want to move from the middle if OP joins their row.\n\nThe person sitting in the middle of the bf & gf is the only person who should have been asked to move. Once they said no, that's it. How many other people should be asked?

If OP moves to the window and lets the couple sit next to each other, someone else now has a row to themselves. \n\nThere's 4 people and 3 of them want middle seats.
