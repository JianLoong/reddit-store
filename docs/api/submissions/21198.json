I like that you doubled down on the flight attendant. I don't get why she thinks she can tell you your seat isn't yours. It doesn't even seem like the flight was that long either so why was it necessary they sit next to each other?", "NTA. They can sit apart for the duration of the flight. They\u2019ll be fine.", "Why do some people feel so entitled? LOL \n\nNTA", "NTA 100%. I fly a lot and really appreciate those flights when I have a row to myself.", "NTA and I'd resort the attendant for trying to harass you to give up your seat and making you a pariah. I agree that either of them could have switched with somebody in one of their rows since they didn't want to spend the big bucks to choose to stay together.", "I'm curious what airline this was, as in my experience the crew is very particular about you staying in your assigned seat. Heck, it was actually an issue in a flight I was on very recently.\n\nAt any rate, NTA. Your seat is your seat. You paid for it and are under no obligation to give it away.", "NTA if you\u2019re flying together then pay to stay together.", "Nta", "NTA.  It would\u2019ve been nice to let them sit together, but nice means going past what is required to not be a jerk.  You\u2019re not required to be nice.\n\nI\u2019m surprised that neither of them could convince the middle seat next to them to trade for a window or an aisle, though - that\u2019s usually an easy sell.  I get that at least at first, they were trying to take your whole row for themselves and have a free seat between them, but once the flight attendant was offering that \u201ccompromise,\u201d someone should have realized that it would\u2019ve been easier to get the person next to one of them to trade a middle for an aisle or a window.", "NTA. Even though you didn\u2019t specifically pick that seat, it was chosen for you to sit in. As Stewie Griffin said \u201cyour poor planning does not constitute an emergency for me\u201d you paid for your ticket just as they paid for theirs. They need to suck it up and deal with it", "You\u2019re lucky the attendant didn\u2019t offer the person in the middle seat next to the man the empty aisle seat next to you so his girlfriend could sit next to him. \n\nStill NTA, you lucked out, enjoy your flight.", "I'm going YTA.  Not a big A, because \"your seat is your seat\" and all, but it's common courtesy to let two people travel together if they've been separated, so long as the seat you get in return is no worse.  And though you lose your open row, you could get any seat you want in exchange.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
