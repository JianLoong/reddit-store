He gave up a great seat just to sit next to his gf for about an hour. I told my wife about this when I got back home and she was like there is no way I'd give up my comfy seat just to sit next you. I agreed with her which is probably why we have a good marriage \ud83d\ude02", "Probably because that guy was a huge asshole about it and it\u2019s was easier to ask so the asshole would shut up. Unfortunately the squeaky wheel gets the grease\n\nEdit: \u201cthe guy\u201d is not OP but the narc that told on him to the attendant", "Yeah, I think it's smart of them to keep to assigned seats because if they need to find you in a hurry/emergency...  \n\n\nHaving said that, I've been upgraded from steerage to 1st class a few times and I don't know if the manifest ever reflected that.", "I thought about that too re the flight attendant. Particularly the attitude, she can ask, but she doesn't get to treat you poorly or give you attitude if you say no. This was your seat!", "Agreed. Don\u2019t know why it took me so long to find this.", "If sitting next to other people is not a pain then why can\u2019t the couple sit next to other people in their assigned seats? How is them asking OP to do what they don\u2019t want to do (sit next to other people) not selfish? Your logic doesn\u2019t make any sense, if OP is selfish for not wanting to next to others then so is the couple.", "Huh, can't you read? OP refused the switch twice, then only at the point of the guy asking rude and entitled questions or whether he 'paid for the seats' was when the OP put on the headphones (and tbh a more than fair reaction, because at that point OP had every right to tell the guy to bugger off). Don't see how pandering to entitled jerks is a 'nice' thing to do, if the guy wanted better seating arrangements he could've payed for it", "> But the whole ignoring him and putting your headphones back on was just straight disrespect\n\nThe guy started to badger OP after being told no once.  Id have refused to engage him too.  OP wasnt interested in continuing the conversation and I dont blame him", "Why didn't the guy reserve those seats then? It's because he didn't want to pay extra and went for the random seat lottery, like OP. Next time the guy can pay extra instead of making an embarrassing and annoying situation for a random passenger to get what he wants", "Wouldn\u2019t it be ESH then?", "We were in mid air. Unless parachuters were joining us, they were remaining unfilled.", "Leg room.", "It would\u2019ve been nice to let them sit together, but nice means going past what is required to not be a jerk.NAT", "My wife gets anxiety on flights so I'd probably give up a good seat to be next to her in case it gets bad. \n\nThat being said, we'd never fly without making sure we were sitting next to eachother in the first place.", "Exactly, the algorithm almost certainly allocates people to centre seats as a priority because they're seen as less desirable and so more likely to prompt an upgrade.\n\nIn this case that worked in OPs favour.", "I understand it because there are horrible, insane people on airplanes who throw fits when they don't get their way and the default is probably to always try for the path of least resistance first.", "Catering to rude assholes seems to work out better for them than telling them \"no.\" Which is unfortunate because they should do their job.", "What's so wrong with her asking? Do you get mad at everything? \n  \nShe didn't try to force you? She only asked a question?", "OP is not an asshole for sitting in his seat. the bf is an asshole for not respecting no as an answer and snitching to the flight attendant.", "I'm convinced that Ryanair is full of npcs trying to mildly irritate you and mess up", "It\u2019s called being a nice person. \n\nGiving up the middle seat would not have caused any issue for OP.", "Knowing you must be treat. /s", "I\u2019m hearing this in the voice of Queen Charlotte. \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, you don't want an insane person to suddenly stand up and start throwing punches at 30k feet lol", "Thats what I was trying to say", "> That's surprising, Ryanair have an almost pathological corporate reluctance to do anything that might make their customer's flight more comfortable unless the customer pays for it.\n\nThat's why they put anyone who doesn't pay extra in a middle seat, and split up people booking together who don't pay extra. I guess OP was lucky to be on a flight they hadn't managed to fill.\n\n> Unless I misunderstood a satirical news article, weren't they at one point toying with the idea of charging a euro to use the toilet?\n\nIf by \"toying with\" you mean \"putting out a press release to get themselves some free publicity\" then yes. I don't think it's ever been a serious idea.", "See also:  standing \"chairs\" like vertical stretchers you strap yourself into...", "Its known European wide and in Britain as routinely having the worse customer service year after year and the owner would often come on social media to be openly rude to customers.\n\nHe even quoted as saying if people are asleep, wake them up and sell shit, he tried to get pilots to fake turbulence to encourage drink sales, he hates his staff and calls them parasites.\n\nWe only use it because its cheap.", "It\u2019s a low cost carrier in Europe, so everything is a fee. All seats are randomly assigned, and I swear their algorithm is designed to break up parties. If you want to sit together it\u2019s an extra couple bucks to pick your seat but nothing outrageous. The couple was just cheap and they could have avoided the whole situation.", "It is, I work purely on logic, common sense and not being naive or a fool", "Uh, no, the airline gave him that seat and they can only put someone next to him, they can't move him around after he has been assigned the seat", "Bwahaha me too!!!", "True! You don't even want that to happen on the ground because calling for backup and getting them off the plain delays the flight and leaves the rest of your passengers late to their destination and leaves them irritable.", "Do you think you make a conscious decision on the conditions you need to fall asleep?\n\nThere's nothing cool about a lack of compassion.", "oh I thought by \"the guy\" you meant OP.", "No, you don't make a conscious decision, but if you're such a light sleeper that you can't sleep if there's a single open shade, then it's on you to manage that. It's your problem to deal with. Bring an eyemask. Take a sleeping pill. You have to regulate your issue. It's not on everyone else on the plane to accommodate your eccentricity.", "Eye masks are a thing. Also I can\u2019t sleep through turbulence, in that case would you think the pilot is not being compassionate of the conditions I need to fall asleep? Plane rides suck, one open window doesn\u2019t make them any worse.", "Yeah looking over it was unclear. I\u2019m gonna edit it. Thanks for helping point that out", "for \u00a310 tickets I'd travel in the cargo with my dog fml \ud83d\ude02", "They're okay for short flights...Ryan Air is like taking a city bus at rush hour.", "Yes, I was flying pre easyJet too. Not pre Braniff which started the trend (but didn't succeed)", "Oh those sales were amazing! I took the 3 kids on last minute weekend getaways and even with airfare, food, souvenirs, taxis/Ubers and lodging we would spend less than \u00a3200\u2026I miss living in England!"]}
