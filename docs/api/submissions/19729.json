You can dress how you want in your yard. As long as your bits are covered, that\u2019s all that matters. He shouldn\u2019t have approached you at all, let alone badger you about changing. Your dad was right to yell at him. And Brad\u2019s son is an adult. He doesn\u2019t have to do what his dad says. Overall, Brad is a controlling ass. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your garden. You were wearing swimwear, not sitting out there nude. He can not look if he's made uncomfortable by you sunbathing in a bikini. What do children have to do with it? Go to any public swimming pool or beach and you will see hundreds of women in bikini's and plenty of kids around. A lot of them parents of said kids.", "NTA\n\nI assume garden = backyard?\n\nSounds like this Brad guy is just uncomfortable, & that's a Brad problem, not a /u/LowConsideration5891 problem. That's also Brad's decision to not let his son hang out with your bro. You & your bro are two separate people, so even if he has some issue with you, I don't see what that has to do with your brother.\n\nI don't see being \"old fashioned\" as a good excuse. You shouldn't have to do something because he's old fashioned. If he doesn't want to see that much, don't look, lol.\n\nI think if you were sunbathing nude in your own backyard then maybe that's a bit too much, but I don't see anything wrong with wearing a bikini in your own place sunbathing, you do you.", "NTA \n\nNobody forcing that weird ass creep to watch you while you\u2019re sunbathing.

No wonder your dad had to go at him. As a dad myself, I absolutely would do the same thing.\n\nHave you told your brother how Brad creeped on you? Maybe your family needs to have a talk with your brother about how it sucks to not be able to see his friend, but it isn't your fault.", "NTA, Brad should cover his creepy attitude.", "NTA HELL TO THE NOOOOOOOOO!

What a woman is wearing in NEVER an excuse for a man behaving badly. Ever! \n\nBrad was uncomfortable seeing you in your bikini, fine, its OK to be uncomfortable. But what Brad should have done was to take himself out of the situation and mind his god damn business. \n\nYou were in your own private garden, you were not indecently exposed (all relevant parts covered) and you were wearing the bikini in what I would consider an acceptable setting (your own graden) so it was none of his business. He made it weird and your correctly reported that back to family members who could address it informally.\n\nAs for stopping his son hanging out with your brother, that just makes Brad all the more the AH here.
