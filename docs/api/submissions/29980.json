I am also 3 months pregnant with our second baby. All of our family and friends were over to celebrate. We decided at the end of the party to say we found one more gift that she didn\u2019t open, and inside was a shirt that said \u201cBig Sister\u201d with the ultrasound also in the bag. Everyone was so excited and telling her she\u2019d be the best big sister ever. It was so special, but a few days later some of my family said that was really tacky and took away from my daughter. They said when she hears about her party she\u2019ll know we made it about us and her new sibling. I talked to a friend about this that was there and she said it seemed kind of selfish to make it about the new baby instead of her. I am so hurt. I thought it would be so special and we purposefully did it at the end of the party and made it about her being a big sister. My husband kind of agrees that we should\u2019ve announced another day. So AITA for announcing on her birthday or should I have done it on another day?", "created_utc": 1698682493, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jx23s/aita_for_announcing_my_second_pregnancy_at_my/", "score": 2384, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They not only will not remember the party, but they don't even understand the point of the party and why it would have been bad form to make the announcement at the birthday party of say a six year old.

Pages and pages from her first day\u2026my brother an i do not. My mom\u2019s reasons are it was harder once there was more than one. While I understand that reasoning to an extent it still kinda hurts.\n\nBirthdays in my opinion are the ONE DAY A YEAR that, in theory, is \u201cyour day\u201d not to a bratty level, or cringey. Just a few hours that celebrate you being a part of the world. (I will note this idea applies to children! And the few milestone birthdays like 15/16,18,21,30). \n\nThis could have been a very sweet and private moment you had with your daughter. But instead, and let\u2019s be honest, you chose to kill two birds with one stone. You saw an opportunity to surprise EVERYONE while they were all together. This wasn\u2019t about it being super special for your daughter, at least not completely. You saw it as a convenience and sold yourself on the idea she would love it\u2026she is one she doesn\u2019t honestly understand. My BIL and his wife did this at their son\u2019s second birthday. And everyone just started instantly congratulating them, talking about the new baby\u2026and forgot about who\u2019s party it really was, at two I could see him upset. So my husband and i went over and played trains and stuff with him. I think a good hour went by before he was acknowledged by his own parents. Just kinda sad because it should have been his day.\n\nYou can\u2019t undo it. But to put into perspective\u2026your daughter is about to have her whole world change. She is gonna go from having sole attention for you and dad to half. She is gonna have to share and im sure you will have her \u201cbe a big sister helper\u201d. She didn\u2019t ask for this. But she will be expected to handle it at 18 months\u2026allow her some grace in this transition. And remember that that birthday was the last time she will have a birthday all about her, where she wont have to share ANYTHING with the new baby, you took that from her for convenience.

I am also 3 months pregnant with our second baby. All of our family and friends were over to celebrate. We decided at the end of the party to say we found one more gift that she didn\u2019t open, and inside was a shirt that said \u201cBig Sister\u201d with the ultrasound also in the bag. Everyone was so excited and telling her she\u2019d be the best big sister ever. It was so special, but a few days later some of my family said that was really tacky and took away from my daughter. They said when she hears about her party she\u2019ll know we made it about us and her new sibling. I talked to a friend about this that was there and she said it seemed kind of selfish to make it about the new baby instead of her. I am so hurt. I thought it would be so special and we purposefully did it at the end of the party and made it about her being a big sister. My husband kind of agrees that we should\u2019ve announced another day. So AITA for announcing on her birthday or should I have done it on another day?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

With all due respect, whoever said you were the A-hole is delusional. Like everyone is pointing out, your daughter is too young to even think she had her moment taken away from her.

I think you are NTA.  You didn\u2019t do anything wrong and personally, I think it was practical of you to inform the people who are important to your family while they were all in one place.

That being said, we do live in a generation whereby everything is caught on camera so your current 1 year old may watch her 1st birthday party footage back in several years' time and be like \"why did you make my first ever birthday about my younger sibling? It feels like you were happy to replace me with the newest shiny baby\".\n\nOf course, this is purely speculative, and your daughter could say when she is older (IF she is close to her younger sibling) that the baby was a great birthday gift to receive. We will never know unless you post an update in like, 10-15 years' time.\n\nI wouldn't call your relatives AH here because there is usually a general consensus surrounding not announcing big news at someone else's own celebration.

This question should be more like is this tacky/lame or not LOL. \n\nThe only weird thing is \"made it about her being a big sister\" at her party. I mean she is only 1 so doesn't care about this baby at all anyways. But you don't gift babies. That part was weird like it's your birthday, yay you're having a sibling that she never asked for or wanted LMAO. \n\nAnd you ASKED your friend if it was weird.

Birthday parties for this age are more for the parents and close family/friends than for the child. At 1 year they don't have a clue what's going on and won't remember it.

Totally fine.", "NTA.  Anyone who says otherwise has unhealthy main character energy.", "NTA. People who are offended on behalf of your 1-yo need to get a life.

If she hears about this event, she most likely won't care.", "Your family is being very dramatic. The one year old is not going to remember the party at all after a year or two but revealing the pregnancy like it was a present for her was a really nice way of introducing the idea of a sibling to her. Much better than what my parents did which was hide it from me until they couldn't anymore which was about a month before my brother arrived and just said, you'll have a brother soon and you need to be a good big sister to him. It definitely affected our relationship growing up.\n\nHaving her associate a new sibling with her fun party and presents is a brilliant idea.\n\nNTA", "NTA. God people need to get a grip. My parents forgot my first birthday because they were working like crazy to provide for our family and only brought in a small cake quite late at night (grandparents were looking after me). According to your family\u2019s logic I should be appalled by the fact they forgot. But these people love me so much and I love them back, they\u2019ve worked so hard to give me everything they can. And I also dont even remember a thing. \n\nI think it is actually so adorable the way you did the second announcement. Nothing has been taken away from your first child - not only is she 1 and she won\u2019t remember but also I wouldnt have found this to be selfish even if she was 5.

I think. \nNTA", "I am sure your one year old will be discussing this with her therapist for years. /s\n\nNTA. The only reason she would even know is if some weird petty person decided to tell her in a mean way that encourages her to feel angry about it.
