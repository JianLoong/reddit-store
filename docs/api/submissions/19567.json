I was initially a SAHM when we got married but eventually found myself a role to play in the development of the family business. SIL is a nurse and works full time. \n\nI have previous experience in marketing and was also co-founder of two startups. It's safe to say I know what I am doing. I even got the first big project for our company before we were even married. I took a contemporary interior design studio hidden in the suburbs to avant garde for high profile clients. \n\nNow that I am the creative director of our company, I donot follow a 9-5 schedule. Our studio is nearby so I only check in for important meetings, but otherwise it's pretty relaxed. \n\nI need input for two situations: \n\n1. Sometimes when we discuss about work at home, SIL walks in and suggests her ideas randomly. I appreciate her spirit but her ideas would never work as they don't fit the client requirements. So we politely dismiss them. Last sunday she complained that we never let her be part of the family business and that she is forced to work an extremely hard 9-5 job while I get to chill at home and also earn respect from our family. My husband let her know that she is welcome to find herself a role that she is comfortable with and pitch in. She told us that we never let her cuz we keep dismissing her ideas. I told her that she can help with finances or something cuz I am already handling design and overlooking marketing. I also suggested that she atleast undertake a course on design if she's really passionate about it. My husband took a full time course when they started the company, BIL is a civil engineering major and FIL has over 30 years of experience in construction, plus I have business experience too, so I think we all have some kind of qualification. But she kept on arguing that it was me who doesn't want her a part of our company. \n\n2. The profit is split 4 ways among me, husband, BIL and FIL. SIL says it should be split 3 ways only and me and my husband should be paid together as we are a unit. I can't fully accept this verdict because I basically take care of the interior design company. I have the experience and I put in the work. I donot work for them, I work with them so I don't see why I should not have my own cut. \n\nSIL has been on our back since last weekend and I m annoyed at this point cuz she refuses to admit that I deserve what I have and calls me an \"entitled bitch\".", "created_utc": 1686502839, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146z1zx/aita_for_not_including_sil_i_family_business/", "score": 174, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your husband are working two separate roles and should be paid as two separate people. SIL is feeling insecure, and that's okay. What's not okay is inflicting that insecurity on others. \n\nCould you talk to your husband, BIL, and FIL about offering for the company to sponsor a course for her while she learns the ropes? If she wants to be an employee, y'all can set her up to be successful. She has to do the work though. I do think that it may have been doing her a disservice to politely dismiss when she chimes in. Explaining that it won't work because it doesn't fit client requirements opens the door to walk her through the process. She's being set up to give inappropriate suggestions now because she's not clued into the facts that allow everyone else to be on target. \n\nIf this were a friend, I'd say to cut her off from discussion about the business. It's your SIL though, so finding a way to make this navigable long term is in your best interest.", "NTA, You are the creative director, she doesn't have a role in the company.  She has zero business suggesting how you get paid.  \n\nIf possible, try to have home meetings be more formal, and seem less like family affairs where anyone can drop in.  That protects your time, keeps meetings focused, and also helps your SIL not feel excluded.  \n\nAlso make an effort to have family conversations that aren't work focused, so that she and others can participate.", "Info: It's SIL married to the BIL you're referring to? If so what does he think of her suggestion about who takes a cut?", "NTA. She sounds unhelpful and entitled to think she can suggest how everyone gets paid.", "NTA\n\nYou're putting in the work, and you've put in the work. I'm assuming she wasn't around during the beginning, back when you probably had a more stressful and intense schedule (SAHM also picking up start-up duties sounds like hell). Thus, she assumes you've been riding on your husband's coattails and wants to do the same.\n\nShe needs to find a different way to contribute, get an education to be able to do the contributions she wants to do, or shut up. I get that she probably wants a less stressful job compared to being a nurse (nurses are heavily abused right now), but this is not how she should be going about it. \n\nIf you want to be nicer about it, perhaps you can let her contribute onto smaller decisions or allow her to be around *quietly* while meetings are happening to soak up some experience. Perhaps you can recommend some online courses for her to take for design or something similar. That is *only if* she lays off of you and stops being entitled. (The irony of her calling you entitled when she thinks she's entitled to a piece of a business she didn't help build is hilarious).\n\nBest of luck OP.", "If she won't even take a course, she's doing it because she doesn't want you to get the money, not actually wanting a part of the company. You all need to make an executive decision (as a company to tell her to back off!!!)", "NTA.  Everyone should play to their strength.   She gets compensated for her labor.  You, BIL, FIL and DH play to your strengths and are likewise individually compensated.  You don\u2019t practice medicine or suggest such care to your SIL\u2019s patients.  You recognize that\u2019s her strength and her training. She should let you do your job and accept that two persons in a marriage each get paid.  By her standard, if you and DH are treated as one contributor, then FIL and BIL should get half what your marital household gets because only 1/2 their marital households are involved in the business.", "NTA - If she\u2019s already suggesting ways to undercut you , 100% keep her out, she sounds like she\u2019ll only cause more issues down the line, if she does start to ever have an equal say.", "You have experience in the field; she does not. You deserve your pay just as equally as all of them. If she wants to be involved, she needs to - as you said- come up with a role she can do and actually benefits the company. \n\nAlso the disrespect of her thinking that you just chill all day as if marketing is easy. I effing hate the disrespect of that as a fellow marketing person. It has its demands - definitely not the same as a nurse - but it doesn't mean we don't deal with our own types of shit. Not that it's a competition, but some acknowledgement that you work at your job would be nice.

Can she be an office manager since she probably has good time management as a nurse. Can she she start somewhere there to be a better leader and \u201cwork her way up\u201d like you did? \n\nThink about it for a moment. She\u2019s trying to be engaged and helpful but \u201cyou know what you\u2019re doing\u201d so you dismiss her. She\u2019s trying but you don\u2019t care. That\u2019s got to make her feel some kind of way. She\u2019s obviously not an idiot or incapable of learning if she\u2019s a nurse so what would it hurt to try to help her find a role, too? It must be hard to be the fifth wheel at dinner conversations that turn into work conversations. You might as well say \u201cGrown ups are going to talk now, why don\u2019t you go get us some ice cream.\u201d\n\nI get you suggesting taking a course but will you (the company) pay for it or for her to cut back on hours to do so? She\u2019s working full time while you \u201ccheck in\u201d so it\u2019s kind of an AH move to ask her to take on additional time and stress because it seems easy for you. Can she work at the company part time to shadow someone while taking the course? How is she supposed to find a role and pitch in when everyone is dismissing her ideas?", "NTA - You both feel devalued. Chill. If she is serious she'll pursue this: \"My husband let her know that she is welcome to find herself a role that she is comfortable with and pitch in.\".  \n\nIt's one thing to want to join but it's another thing to evaluate your talents, conceptualize how you can contribute, and detail what you will bring to the table. Her statements would not be accepted or acknowledged if she was not family: split compensation differently, I have \"X\" idea (said on the fly).  Yes everyone interested can win. Her criticism is targeted at you. Stay focused on winning and don't get derailed. Up to this point major business votes are conducted by the 4 of you, correct? If she is joining you the 4 would need to sit down and define what this would look like.", "I already suggested that she take up a course. I am a firm believer in learning the basics even if one is a natural at the skill. But she isn't patient enough to do a full-time course and she certainly isn't a natural", "Yes, they are married. BIL is the introverted type who barely makes conversation other than what's necessary. He hasn't commented yet on favor of either side.", ">back when you probably had a more stressful and intense schedule (SAHM also picking up start-up duties sounds like hell). \n\nOoh, actually, my friends and I started a start-up after we graduated, which was at 21. I married my husband at 25, so it was not as hectic. But we were dating all the while, and that's when I helped marketing his company", ">She needs to find a different way to contribute, \n\nThat's the whole problem.  She wants in on the fun, fulfilling position.  First, that's already taken by OP and second, even if you didn't already have the creative job she didn't go to higher ed and learn design, marketing or what have you to acquire the skills.  She'd also have to start from the ground up just like OP and do grunt work until she proves herself talented enough for more.  Even someone in the family earmarked for taking over a business and who will get promoted over a long-time employee because they're eventually going to inherit the operation still needs to put in the work by getting the relevant education and learning how the business works before their parent's retirement.\n\nYou don't just jump into these positions.", "She is married to my husband's brother", "Of course, she is more than welcome to find her place in management. But she wants in on design and design is not something one can chime in without knowing the deliverables. We would be more than happy to pay for her course. She can take time off to pursue it full time. If not, at least an online course plus an office job. She has a job ready for her when she has obtained the necessary skill,  so I don't think it would hurt their livelihood. It's just her attitude to expect things on a platter, no questions asked is what annoys me.", "Yes. It's always been the four of us after I started participating seriously.", "That's different from what the reply said. She may not take the offer but having the family offer to support her into this world may be the validation she needs to let it go. She may not take it but you'll be in a much better place to show that you're not against her, people just have different skills and priorities.\n\nIt may help to also give her some validation about her work. Saving lives is something very few people are willing to do and nurses are so ridiculously underpaid.\n\nUltimately she is just feeling excluded, going at it with empathy is more important than going at it with a business plan", "I think his opinion would be invaluable here and best to ask if when SIL is not present.", "Have you had the conversation with her? Not just dismissing her design ideas but an actual \u201cwe welcome you but we think this is where your assets and skill sets would benefit us more\u201d kind of talk? Have her come into the office and take away the personal nature and just banter a bit about what she wants, what the company needs, and how that plays together. Maybe she doesn\u2019t realize there are other aspects of the company that better suit her natural strengths and a company need. Quality? Customer service? Organizing meetings and lunches? Things that maybe don\u2019t require the technical skills that design does but do require some basic leadership, time manage, or organizational skills.", "Good. She is not creating a positive vibe by calling one of the four an EB. It seems like a tantrum and who wants this in the workplace?!", "NTA, but youre kind of screwed. shes jealous and either way shes going to be mad at you. either she starts helping out and shes going to want to rearrange everyones cut because of what she puts in or she going to be forever mad shes \u201cexcluded\u201d even though shes not making the moves to become an equally contributing member of the company. but like connie said papa never talked business at the dinner table, so if you dont want to hear about the business problem with her your going to have to stop talking about it with her until her husband deals with this issue", "You could always say something like, that\u2019s an interesting idea. However our clients are wanting a very different concept. If she asks a pertinent question, you could go from there. It doesn\u2019t sound like she would, tho. Does she even have a clear understanding of the different roles you all play. (Clearly not)", "NTA \n\nNgl, I\u2019d tell her to fuck off. Who tf does she think she is telling you guys who\u2019s qualified or not? And how you get paid? She wouldn\u2019t be invited to Christmas if that was my family. \n\n*What the actual fuck* smh", "NTA I would tell her they can go back to splitting profits 3 ways no problem... If you get paid an appropriate salary for a creative director. Which would come out of the profits! Why should you work for free?\n\nSounds like she wants to be a SAHM or as she seems to feel she shouldn't have to actually find a way to contribute but still profit.", "And when she gets hired full time, remember that she and her her husband combined get the same past her husband used to get when only he was working by her own logic.", "She sounds like she'd be a huge pain in the ass and she's already undermining and attacking OP.

If she doesn't like you being part of the share, explain what your work would cost if you were an independent company.", "This might not work out for the business. Maybe BIL can help set her up in a separate business company not affiliated with the family business. NTA.", "NTA her husband really needs to put a stop to this. You should also definitely not let her find a role after she called you names and thinks you should work for free.", "NTA\n\nYou and your husband are a unit in marriage, not in business. If you were ordinary employees in a business, HR wouldn't say you should be paid as a unit. Her reasoning is completely off, and sounds like nothing but petty jealousy. \n\nYou would never try to insert an IV or give an injection without training, and she can't assume to do work for a design firm without training. It would be interesting for you all to hand her a mock up to work a design on, just to show her how NOT easy it is. \n\nIt does seem like eventually you will all have to put your collective foot down about this. Her constant nattering is crazy making.\n\nI wish you four the best of luck with this. She sounds like a headache.", "NTA stop having meetings where she is and set some boundaries.", "Sadly we all live together already. It's a joint family", "If she starts starts small at the company, until she learns all the ropes, she will only be paid a glorified worker's salary. I wasn't paid even that when I started out. I don't think she will be happy about it, though.", "I agree. This is something the BIL needs to clear up with his wife. The wife clearly doesn't respect op and what she does for the company. This is why working with family sucks. I hope the brother steps up to the plate.", "Ooh I think she would be okay with me getting paid monthly but I pretty much take care of the whole company while my husband and BIL concentrate on the other two, so I think it's unfair to be paid only for bring the creative director.", "Don\u2019t let her join.  It won\u2019t end well.  Nta.", "What does a joint family mean?", "You work together and live together. That sounds like hell.", "Fair enough, then if you did this your salary should reflect that, or do it as a formal profit share like most CEOs get (since it sounds like CEO may be more accurate).  My point is, she is being an AH saying you and your husband count as 1 as it essentially considers your time worthless. If they were to even entertain agreeing that it should just be the men (insert eyeroll here at the sexism), then you should get a salary that reflects your contribution.\n\nShe may not like that if it would actually lessen the portion that she and her husband received as it would come out of the profits ;)", "Not really her decision to keep her out since it is her husband and the SiL\u2019s husband\u2019s company.  One of the many problems of working with family.  Definitely NTA, though."]}
