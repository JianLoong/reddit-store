Kids were allowed to come because my brother is a big family guy and wanted the entire family to be there. I could only find a white dress for my daughter that she would wear. All the other ones we had tried on were too itchy or uncomfortable. I texted my brother asking if it was okay because the whole \"don't wear white it draws attention from the bride\" thing. But he said both he and his now wife thought it was fine because she's a kid. I even asked if he wanted me to dye it pink or something like that but he told me it was really pretty and to leave it how it was. The wedding itself was alright, it was very beautiful. My daughter was quiet and well behaved the whole time. Everything was alright until my sister came up to me and said something along the lines of \"Hey\u2026 you should take your daughter home.\" I didn't understand why so I questioned her and she showed me text messages sent to her from our now SIL talking about how I should be ashamed of letting my daughter wear that, along with photos of me and my child talking to family. She even made a comment about my dress (I wore baby blue to fit the color scheme) talking about how the dress was \"too close to white\" it wasn't, but ok. I waited till after the wedding to text her about it asking why she was faking photos of my daughter and I when she said it was fine. Apparently she did say it was fine but expected me to know it wasnt.
