I was very happy and ecstatic, I kept saying thank you!

That was one of the main details they knew about my life, so I doubt that they meant it about some other struggle, because of course I hadn\u2019t told them about any other struggles Im going through.

Unfortunately for me when they came by today to check out the place, my grandma noticed it in the open trash can. She didn\u2019t say anything but before they left I saw them talking to my dad about something apparently serious outside. My dad got annoyed and said that if I threw it away, the least I could\u2019ve done was hide it. I\u2019m mad that he\u2019s mad at me. I thought he out of all people would understand why this hurts me and how offensive it is to me as a person.\n\nP.S. I love my dad very much. He has made it clear he doesn\u2019t support what they feel about this whole situation and he doesn\u2019t care that I prefer women. He even supported me through my awkward confused middle school pixie cut phase. He\u2019s a cool dude. I\u2019m just pissed off at his reaction but I guess I understand it a little bit.

They don't seem to understand how the personal biases and faults of that self-appointed authority can corrupt the message of the faith they claim to hold.\n\nIn the Bible, Jesus literally sat down and talked to prostitutes and other \"sinners\" because he saw that they're in a marginalized position and were the most in need of his help.

I got kinda worried that he actually had a problem with it and was overcompensating or something and mentioned this to my mum, but she told me actually she was pretty sure that it was because his best friend in uni was gay and unalived himself in the middle of the AIDS crisis, he just really really wanted me to know I was supported.
