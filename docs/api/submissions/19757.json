I was very happy and ecstatic, I kept saying thank you!

Unfortunately for me when they came by today to check out the place, my grandma noticed it in the open trash can. She didn\u2019t say anything but before they left I saw them talking to my dad about something apparently serious outside. My dad got annoyed and said that if I threw it away, the least I could\u2019ve done was hide it. I\u2019m mad that he\u2019s mad at me. I thought he out of all people would understand why this hurts me and how offensive it is to me as a person.\n\nP.S. I love my dad very much. He has made it clear he doesn\u2019t support what they feel about this whole situation and he doesn\u2019t care that I prefer women. He even supported me through my awkward confused middle school pixie cut phase. He\u2019s a cool dude. I\u2019m just pissed off at his reaction but I guess I understand it a little bit.

And if he genuinely supports you, the hypocrisy with not standing up to his parents is putrid.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nShould have left it in the bathroom... With the first dozen pages torn out.", "NTA at all, I don\u2019t usually condone burning books but if there was a fire going in the log burner it would have been straight in there (with them watching)", "NTA\nThey needed to see that, and your Dad needs to stand up to his parents. They have no regard for your feeling so why is there a reverence for their feelings?", "NTA.\n\nIf it's the season, maybe pull it out of the garbage and use it as a firestarter for the charcoal grill when they come over for Father's Day or some other grilling holiday?\n\n<evil grin>", "Your dad should have stood up you for you. NTA", "Normally, I would find the thought of burning books appalling, but in this case, I would have used that book to start a fire. In a fire pit, of course. NTA", "NTA\n\nThey bought you something offensive you did exactly what most people should have done.  \n\nWhat if you bought grandma all of Ozzy Osbournes CD\u2019s, a big fuck off dildo and stripper heels? All great gifts for some people but mee-maw might not like them.  \n\nActually, no. They bought you something much more offensive.  \nFuck them.", "NTA times a million! Unfortunately, you\u2019re going to have to keep your grandparents at metaphorical arms\u2019 length going forward if you choose to keep contact with them at all. Your own mental health and well being are more important than the outdated opinions of religious AHs. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to go through that, but on the positive side you are living your truth which is the best thing for you. And when you show your true colours, it\u2019s often the fastest way to find out who your true \u2018family\u2019 is! Choose the people that are supportive and healthy for you to be around and they will be your family whether or not they\u2019re related by blood.", "NTA. And your father's anger is definitely misplaced, he should be angry with them.", "NTA\n\nYour g'parents are probably the same people complaining about \"gay agendas\" being shoved down their throats.", "NTA, unless you somehow knew that they were going to be coming by and would see it in the trash can.\n\nThe next time they try to lecture you or \"steer you in the right direction\" you can tell them something akin to \"I have faith that God put me on this track for a reason, and who am \\*I\\* to question God for doing so?\"  And if they keep trying then basically keep hammering in to them that THIS IS God's path for you, and who are THEY to question God about it?", "Nta\nIf they don\u2019t like that you have a girlfriend that\u2019s their problem, their reasoning is terrible, just because they don\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t mean they should give you w to \u201cput you on the right track.\u201d You had every right to throw it out, I would too if I were you to be honest", "OP, they do not mean we'll. Homophobia is never well meant. NTA.", "NTA, that wasn't a \"gift\", it was a reading assignment... That being said I wouldn't have been so obvious with the binning part.", "NTA", "NTA, you were way way way way nicer about it than I think most people (including myself) would've been.\n\nPretending to mean well doesn't absolve someone of being an asshole.", "When you threw the book away did you just chuck it or go with a hook shot?\n\nNTA especially as it was very nice of you not to blow up in front of everyone when your grandparents gave you a very insulting \"gift\".", "Ultimately you are NTA for throwing the book away. You do need to take some time to gain some perspective, though. My children are 16 and 18. Both are WELL aware that super religious people (esp the kind who come to people's homes) are homophobic although we do not spend time with such people. That you are part of the LGBTQ+ community and that naive is concerning and could put you in danger. Please take some time to educate yourself and talk to some of the older folks in the family who can share valuable information with you.", "NTA. They deserve to know their gift was trash.", "NTA for throwing a disparaging gift.\n\nYTA for making it plain, which could only lead to a war. dad protects you but you did not protect him.", "NTA - but you should have read the book..  its hysterical!", "NTA. Age/generation is just an excuse people use for \"ignorant and refuses to change\" when they want to avoid conflict.\n\nYou have obviously made a huge effort to accommodate and avoid conflict with your grandparents, and that's a kind and generous thing to do for people that you love, even in spite of their faults. \n\nIt's unfortunate that they saw the book in the garbage, but what's done is done. The question is what next? Do you all ignore the elephant in the room going forward, or do you sit down and have a talk about accepting you for who you are?\n\n>It would not be fun to have your parents feel hurt from something your kid did.\n\nYeah. There's a flip side to that too though. Where was his anger when his parents hurt his kid? Is your dad strongly conflict avoidant? Or to be cynical, are your GPs wealthy? Is there an inheritance under.threat now because of his wicked daughter?", "NTA. And OP is more mature than I am at more than twice their age. I would have given it back and gone \u201cno thank you.\u201d", "NTA This wasn\u2019t a gift. Just proselytizing.", "If there was a \"Dummies\" book on not being a judgmental prick, it would be a best seller - because a LOT of people would be buying it to gift to other people!", "Why on earth would OP wanna go to her grandparents' church with her girlfriend if this is the kind of shit they preach? That'd be like taking your black girlfriend to your grandfather's KKK meeting.", "Do they make a habit of peering at your trash, or only when they want to confirm that they hurt you?", "You're definitely NTA for throwing it out, and I'm sorry they're not supportive of who you are and think you need to be set \"on the right path\".\ud83e\ude75", "I don't think that's immature. I think that's a good reaction that they'd deserve", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Please don't paint all boomers with the same brush. There are plenty of us that have spent large parts of our lives fighting for LGBTQ rights and against politicians who want to curtail those rights. Not all of us became more conservative as we got older.", "You have to be joking. How could you possibly think \"the whole boomer generation\" is close-minded about this? This is a problem that crosses generational lines, and plenty of people from all generations would also support OP. This has more to do with religious extremism than birth year.", "People really make no connection between \"boomers\" and \"who lived through the AIDS crisis.\" It's amazing.", "Further, Charlottesville was filled with a hell of a lot of Millenials and Gen Zers. Saying it's generational is ignoring the problem of individual bigotry.", "Chalking it up to generation is letting them off the hook. My father--a straight, white Boomer raised in the rural Midwest--was out protesting Anita Bryant's homophobia in the 70s, and my maternal grandparents (born in 1928 and 1933) not only fully embraced their gay son but endowed an LGBT film festival at a college he taught at in his honor. There's no excuse for people to have lived through multiple civil rights movements and ignored them all.", "It has nothing to do with \"their generation\". I'm 69 years old, so likely part of your grandparents' generation, and have always supported LBGTQ rights. And my mother, who was of an even earlier generation, would level anyone who made racist, homophobic, or sexist comments. Your grandparents are bigots because that's who they are, not because of their age.", "It\u2019s not their generation. It\u2019s them. As individuals. The generational psychology explanation is just that, an explanation, not an excuse. \n\nMy grandfather was born to poor Eastern European immigrants. He was raised and was racist and homophobic back in the day.  But he chose to learn and grow his perspective with subsequent experiences. One day, he literally had tears in his eyes when I was telling him about one of my childhood friends who had just married her and wife. He told me, the kids were taught that gay people were perverts and would hurt them. He told me, we didn\u2019t know any better. \n\nAnd that\u2019s that. Back whenever, the average person maybe didn\u2019t know any better. But we all know better now. Remaining steadfast in hatred is a conscious choice.", "Oh, grandpa, you mean SMARTER THAN YOU?  Also better looking and with better life financial prospects?", "This is absolutely adorable.  There is definitely a difference between religious and bible belt look down and condemn everyone religious.", "THANK YOU! I worked for eight years doing behavioral research and education on AIDS with the local public health department, and watched way too many people I cared about die from AIDS. If you're an anti-LGBTQ boomer now, you probably felt the same way then.", "Your family sounds fucking incredible!", "Thank you. My grandmother (born in the 1910s) had a big circle of gay male friends. My great-aunt (older than her) was openly lesbian. My straight boomer parents have a boomer gay male friend so close he's effectively my godfather, and we went on family trips with another gay male friend of his all the time when I was a child. Plenty of young people right now are also horribly homophobic, unfortunately. \n\nWhen people chalk it up to an all or nothing generational thing, they not only let older (and younger!) bigots off the hook, they also justify inaction because supposedly we just have to wait for \"them\" to die off and then everything will automatically be great. I hate that canard."]}
