My grandparents are extremely religious. They\u2019re the type of people to put flyers on peoples doors. It annoys me but obviously I never say anything about it, and I don\u2019t know them well enough to talk about religion with them. \n\nI currently have a girlfriend. I had absolutely no idea that they would have an issue with this when I told them. They came to town and we greeted them. During small talk they asked if I had a boyfriend and I said a girlfriend. They sort of exchanged glances with each other and I knew they were judging me.\n\nThe judgment was confirmed when last night we got dinner and they had bought me something while in town for my birthday. I was very happy and ecstatic, I kept saying thank you! But when I opened it, it was a book called \u201cbecoming the woman god wants me to be.\u201d I had no issue with it and said thanks until my grandpa explained that they hope this read will \u201cget me back on track\u201d and that they thought I \u201cneeded god during this difficult time in my life.\u201d I knew, absolutely KNEW that this was because I told them I had a gf. That was one of the main details they knew about my life, so I doubt that they meant it about some other struggle, because of course I hadn\u2019t told them about any other struggles Im going through. I asked my dad and he didn\u2019t either. I was trying to convince myself I was offended for no reason. I know that they technically meant well but wow.\n\nI got annoyed and went silent the rest of dinner. I could tell my dad knew I was pissed about it. When I got home, I threw the book away. Unfortunately for me when they came by today to check out the place, my grandma noticed it in the open trash can. She didn\u2019t say anything but before they left I saw them talking to my dad about something apparently serious outside. My dad got annoyed and said that if I threw it away, the least I could\u2019ve done was hide it. I\u2019m mad that he\u2019s mad at me.

Your grandparents are definitely T A here as they're telling you, not in a subtle way, that you are wrong as you are, you need to change, and they have the tool for you to do so. This is about as far as they can get from accepting you.\n\nYou're NTA for throwing away the book. The book is a direct, personal insult to you and has no place in your home. You're not obligated to appreciate a gift.

Not in any way shape or form.\n\n1) You are a very kind person that seemed so happy to spend time with your grandparents and get any gift from them.\n\n2) You were asked, and answered honestly, that you didn't have a boyfriend, but a girlfriend. You didn't even start that, THEY did. They didn't mind their own business.\n\n3) You waited until later, hiding your very valid feelings, to throw away that useless and offensive piece of junk.\n\n4) Your dad took the cowardly way out and is mad that he has to deal with his parents rather than put them in their proper place and defend his daughter. Disgusting.\n\nYeah OP, you are definitely NTA but you sure are surrounded by AH. I wish you all the best and hope you can get out of that situation quickly and go NC with them all. <3", "Definitely NTA if you having a gf drives a wedge between you and then it\u2019s their loss.

I would have ripped them a new one right there in the public setting. I\u2019m so sorry you were put in the position and made to feel that way. Your feelings are SO valid and you were not offended for no reason. That\u2019s a HUGE reason to be offended!", "NTA. Your parents should have defended you.

I'd probably have gone full blown double barrel rage on them, you did good being civil and waiting until they left. They have no right to inspect your home... they were looking for that and they found it, good for them. \n\nYour dad will get over it, he's stuck between his parents and his kid, that's never fun.

A gift is something the receiver appreciates. What they gave you was a glorified political pamphlet.\n\nI can understand your GPs feeling hurt to see what they considered a gift in the trash. But that's mostly on them for not thinking about your feelings about the \"gift\".\n\nYour dad is definitely TA because he seems more concerned about how it affects him more than supporting you. The same comment could have been said in a more supportive/humorous way, like \"Welp, that could have been hidden better, but at least that takes care of telling them that you didn't read the book\".", "NTA. Regardless of their beliefs, they're ignoring your feelings to force what they think is best for you.\n\nImagine if this was anything not religious.

Veganism might have merits and be well-intentioned, but that's not a gift.", "NTA, but you might want to cut your dad some slack. He wasn't mad at you for having a girlfriend. He wasn't even mad at you for throwing away that idiotic book. He was mad at you for getting caught throwing away that idiotic book. He seems to understand why it hurts you and how offensive it is. He's just mad because they got mad at him and he had to have an argument with them that could have been avoided by you pushing the book down into the trash, or just waiting until they were gone to throw it away.  \n\nOh, and when some idiot tries to imply that there is something wrong with you, force them to say it specifically through probing language...\n\n\"Back on track? How am I off track?\"\n\n\"Difficult time? What difficult time?\"\n\nJust keep telling them you don't know what they're talking about, and if they remain vague, just say that you don't think you need something like this because you're completely on track and not having a difficult time at all.

You knew your grandparents were \"extremely religious\" but you had \"absolutely no idea\" that they would have an issue with your homosexuality?", "NTA, I have a whole drawer in my basement full of shit like that people have tried to give me over the years.  I might as well have thrown them away, they\u2019ve been there for years at this point.  I just personally feel weird about throwing away/destroying a book.  But that\u2019s just me.  You handled that about as well as you could have, without the inevitable Christian freak out they would have had if you directly confronted them.  I mean, people like them maybe would have understood better if you burned it?
