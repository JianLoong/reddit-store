At first, things were great, and for the most part I really do love my job. Most of my coworkers are great and the work environment is pretty positive. However there's this one guy (Bob) who has taken to making incredibly snide remarks about my faith almost daily without fail.\n\nFor context, I am a practicing Christian and I am strong in my faith. But, I am NEVER one to shove it down someone's throat or even bring it up unless explicitly asked. I have been witness to holier-than-thou people enough in my life to know how obnoxious and unwelcome it is. The only reasons he knows I am religious are because I wear a small cross necklace and at lunch (we eat together as a company) I \\*silently\\* make the sign of the cross and pray quickly before eating. It is a private motion, I purposefully make sure its small and not in anyone's face.\n\nWell, Bob started noticing and HE was the one who started asking me a ton of questions about my faith. First it started as just mild questions like \"oh are you religious?\" \"how often to you go to church?\" and stuff like that. I really didn't mind, I can talk about my faith no problem as long as you're respectful, I can even laugh at certain things. I like to think I am open enough to not get offended at the first sign of judgment or questions. But it quickly became constant remarks that come across as way more snarky and condescending. Here are a few examples:\n\nHe was talking about drugs with another coworker and I was within earshot and he goes loudly \"Oh I'm sure YOU'VE (me) never done drugs, right? You good little Christian??\"\n\n\"What do you have for lunch today?? The holy eucharist??\"\n\n\\*to another coworker as I walk up\\* \"Oh hush, we can't talk about that in front of miss SAINT over here!\"\n\nThese are just a few of an endless list of remarks he's made. I don't make judgey comments about his life or anything. When I first started I was friendly with him but now I barely acknowledge him and he STILL makes all these comments purposefully when I'm within earshot and I am just getting so sick of it. I snapped at him at lunch one day when he made a very rude assumption about my faith and I said \"Excuse you. Please stop talking about my faith when you yourself has said you know nothing about it.\" That worked for a bit but now he's picked the nagging back up and I'm so tired of it. I've gotten much shorter with him recently and my other coworker told me I should try to be nicer.\n\nI don't know. I think I'm within my rights to be tired and sick of his attitude when I have been nothing but civil and friendly with him previously. I am thinking of taking it up with my boss, but its a small company and I know that it would make this thing a huge deal bc Bob loves office drama and always talks about other people. Yet, I feel like I have the right to work in peace and not be on edge every time he's near my desk.", "created_utc": 1674768083, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m2vov/wibta_for_complaining_to_my_boss_about_a_coworker/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
