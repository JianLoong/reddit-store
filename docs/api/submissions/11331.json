I invited them inside anyway and we were just chilling out for a bit. One of my friends said he would make us all some protein shakes before they leave to go the gym. He asked if I wanted one and I agreed.\n\na few minutes after drinking mine I started to feel shaky. I wasn't sure what was going on, I told my friends my chest was feeling weird and they started to panic too. 25 minutes went by and I was not feeling any better I was panicking now and my chest was feeling tight. Another of my friends called an ambulance for me. When I arrived at the hospital They asked me if I had taken any substances including caffeine. I told them no when my friend piped up and said yes I had. I was confused so I asked him and he told me that \"He put some pre-workout in my protein shake to try and lift me up a bit and make me come to the gym with them\" I was angry and I felt betrayed that he would do this behind my back without telling me. I told him I have a heart problem, at this point my other friends start to defend him and say that I should have told them, that there was no way for them to know I shouldn't take pre-workout.\n\nI had no serious problems from taking it and the doctor said I was all okay. I was still angry at my friend and the other friends for defending him. I said it wasn't cool he did it without telling me. My other friends continue to defend him saying he couldn't have known not to. I have received a few comments that were hurtful calling me a baby for \"crying\" about it etc\n\nI feel like I am going crazy. Is it my fault for not telling them before hand?

Send them this post if they keep harassing you.", "Do your friends know you don't consume caffeine?", "'saying he couldn't have known not to'. - exactly. That's why he shouldn't put things in people's food, he can't know what they have. (NTA)", "NTA. Your friend knowingly drugged you. So what that it was 'only' caffeine? It's still a mood altering substance that they didn't have explicit consent from you to include in the drink.\n\nAnd that's before we get into the toxicity of not respecting your boundaries. You, and you alone, get to decide if you're well enough to workout. 'Lets drug you to make you feel better so you can do X activity' is not respecting your boundaries, isn't acceptable, and that logic goes into some really dark places when you swap out 'caffeine' and 'workout' for other things.\n\nTime for new friends who don't feel like they're entitled to your medical history or the ability to decide how well you feel at any given time.", "INFO\n\nThey prepped the shake in your home, was it with your ingredients or something the friends brought over?", "NTA I can't believe what I'm reading here.  You were offered a protein smoothie not pre workout. He admits to sneaking it in there to get you to go to the gym. He didn't ask if you wanted some nor is this a normal thing in the smoothie. It's not even something you would have had in your house.\n\nYou never force people to eat things against their consent. It's wrong. You don't have to disclose your medical history to deserve that basic right. Lots of people don't know pre-workout has caffeine. He could know your full dietary restrictions and still fuck up.", "ESH if you have a life threatening condition, it is on YOU to make sure nothing you consume has caffeine in it. \n\nThey reacted poorly, but they\u2019re not wrong about how it\u2019s not their fault they didn\u2019t know.", "NTA.  You do not tamper with somebody else's food.  You ESPECIALLY do not do that to change their mood.  It didn't have to be caffeine; they would have been assholes for adding sugar, just as much.  You don't mess with other people's food.\n\nYour friends are assholes, and are doubling down on being assholes by getting mad at you.", "EDIT: Disregard. Friends are assholes, OP is NTA. Knowing now that it was the protein mix that OP kept in their own kitchen, your friend is 1000% the asshole for adding anything.\n\nHaving said that, I still think it\u2019s a good idea to let your workout partners/friends know about your condition just in case something happens at the gym and you need medical assistance.\n\n~~NAH, but this whole thing definitely could\u2019ve been handled better.~~\n\n~~On the one hand, your friend added an ingredient to your drink without letting you know, which isn\u2019t cool.~~\n\n~~On the other hand, it\u2019s a pretty common for workout-related drinks to have caffeine in them. If you have a heart condition that makes caffeine a no-no for you, it\u2019s your responsibility to inform someone who\u2019s preparing a shake for you so that they don\u2019t add something that you can\u2019t have, especially with caffeine being so common.~~\n\n~~No assholes, just a confluence of bad choices.~~", "INFO: did they know you had a dietary restriction of caffeine?", "Why didn't you ask what was in the protein shake?", "NTA.\n\nThere are *religions* that prohibit caffeine.  You never, *never* dose someone with *anything*, including caffeine, without consent.  \n\n(Only exception I can think of is a medical professional who knows what they're doing when there's an emergency.  Even then, best to get consent from next of kin.)", "Dude, I have a heart arrhythmia, and I can't have caffeine otherwise I risk an SVT and a trip to the emergency room. You need to let friends know about that. How were they supposed to know? Lots of things have caffeine in them.\n\nMild YTA. Please share info about your condition with your friends. Of course you are allowed privacy, but you also need to treat this like an allergy. That's critical info that you left out. Trust your friends.", "NTA... but you're not making a smart choice for knowing you have this health condition and yet taking food from others without questioning what's in it. You don't have to tell your friends about your condition, but you also can't expect them to make you a smoothie based on the dietary needs you haven't told them about.", "NTA all he said was that it was a protein shake, he needed to ask you before adding something", "NTA\n\nYou should not ever have to disclose medical info for people to not lie about what they are feeding you. Ditch these friends, they are not good people.", "NAH. Caffeine is a really common ingredient in workout supplements and is not dangerous for most people, so its reasonable that your friend didn\u2019t think to check with you, especially since you never mentioned you have a heart condition. It\u2019s also reasonable that you were upset after being surprised with caffeine given that you landed in the hospital. This all could have been avoided with more communication on both fronts.", "NTA. And these people are NOT your friends. A friend would not have put something in your drink without asking you. A friend would have been horrified to discover that they had given you something potentially harmful. A friend would not defend someone who caused you to go to the hospital in an ambulance. A friend would not call you a baby for objecting to all of the above. Also, a friend would offer to pay for your medical costs. I'm betting no such offer has been made.", "NAH. I also have a heart condition that means I need to limit caffeine (and do a whole bunch of other things), so I understand where you're coming from.\n\nYou are, of course, never obligated to disclose anything medical to anyone else. For that, NTA.\n\nYour friends should, of course, never sneak something into someone else's food. HOWEVER, it doesn't occur to most people (not us, of course, but most people) that a  caffeinated pre-workout is anywhere near the sort of thing that would be harmful, or that it's something a person would need to avoid. It's very convincing that this is an innocent mistake. (And I say this as someone who has experience similar things.) Especially in the context of someone making a shake to drink before working out, this isn't a super-wild action.\n\nNow: if you are so sensitive to caffeine that you HAVE TO AVOID IT or you will be hospitalized, you may want to actually consider notifying other people around you in the future, just like if you had a dangerous allergy. It's no one's business, but it's important for your own safety.", "ESH.\n\nIt wasn't right for your friend to add more ingredients to your protein shake without getting the okay from you first.\n\nHOWEVER, if you have a condition that could end up being life-threatening in more than one setting, you *need* to let people know, for your own health, so they can act appropriately if you have another one of these attacks, and what they should avoid so it doesn't happen again.", "ESH. \n\nOne simple reason for it too:\n\nA lack of communication.\nCaffine is a common stimulant in some foods and drinks, so the average person wouldn't think twice about if it's dangerous. If it is serious enough that it could hurt you, then there is no good reason to keep it from people you consider friends.it was an honest mistake that could've been avoided if you had simply been forthright.\n\nOn the other side, adding the caffeine to your drink without asking you was, at best thoughtless and at worst a violation of trust, though you have to admit there was no malicious intent. It was still very inappropriate.\n\nCommunication works both ways, and neither of you did so.", "Edit:  NTA based on the edit.  You should still tell your friends if you have a health issue and you are working out with them. I am actually leaning to ESH for two reasons.  You go to the gym with your friends regularly, they should know you have a heart condition in case something happens when there.  It is just common sense. \nSecond, these days, caffeine or other stimulants or herbs or whatnot in pre workout shakes is kind of a normal thing.  I wouldn't take one without asking exactly what they put in it.  If you asked and they lied, then NTA.  If you didn't ask, ESH.", "**ESH** but your friends are the FAR bigger AHs\n\nYou're a tiny bit of an AH because while no one is technically entitled to your personal medical information, your friends are clearly gym buddies who you work out with regularly, and their knowing that you have a serious heart condition is obviously relevant and potentially life-saving (or -threatening) information. More importantly (and crucial to your being an AH), the fact that you \"don't really like telling people\" in this context reeks of internalised ableism and the idea that admitting that you have a heart condition is somehow embarrassing or shameful. It's not. Health issues are value neutral. It's perpetuating stigma like this, and the idea that there's something embarrassing about having a health problem, that could have gotten you killed here.\n\nBut your friends are MASSIVE AHs because they literally poisoned you. No, they didn't know about your heart condition. Doesn't matter. You don't bloody well give someone preworkout, which often contains super questionable and sometimes dangerous ingredients even for healthy people (most pre-workout is classified under \"nutrition\" products and therefore are regulated by the FDA as \"food\", even though they can affect you just as much as drugs). Lots of supplements interact not only with health conditions but with medications and things. They should never have given you preworkout without your knowledge. That shit is not harmless.\n\nESH. You need to work on how you view your own and other people's health conditions and not seeing it as \"brokenness\" or something shameful. And they need to work on not putting things in other people's bodies without consent.", "NTA but that guy is a major AH and so are the friends defending him for slipping you a substance without your knowledge.", "NTA, yeah don't frat boy poison people's shit. He should have realized you don't take caffeine, and as also part of the 7% of people in America that can't have caffeine (or choose not to drink it) they should have noticed by now that you don't do caffeine.", "You're not the asshole for not telling them about your heart condition, but YTA for getting angry. \n\nThey added a pretty innocuous ingredient, how were they supposed to guess it would hurt you? People won't know these things if you don't tell them.", "I am actually surprised by all these comments and NO ONE has asked\u2026who puts pre workout in a protein shake?? Like\u2026is this normal?? I\u2019m not judging\u2026I just really wanna know", "NTA. Why are you friends with them? You are under no obligation to share personal information with anyone except a spouse or partner. They didn't need to know. But what makes this worse is that this incident happened because they were trying to force you to do what they wanted you to do; they had no respect for you. And in order to get you to comply, they pulled that underhanded stunt. You need better friends. No, cancel that-you need REAL friends.", "NTA I was going to say none here but your friends' reactions after the hospital trip makes them assholes.\nSure they definitely wouldn't have given you it if they knew, but you would have said no if they'd been honest about what they were making. \n\nIt's similar to having an allergy - if someone's making you a cup of tea, probably not going to mention if you're allergic to eggs, for example, but if they're offering cake too would say no thanks.", "NTA but your friends are. They essentially drugged you without your knowledge. That\u2019s fucked up.", "NTA. Your friends are mild AHs. Adding an ingredient to your your shake when it was prepared in your home with your protein powder is not cool. There are loads of reasons someone may not want to take caffeine. Being supportive is great. Giving your friends supplements without asking is not showing support in an appropriate way. Hopefully this can be a learning experience for your friends. They shouldn\u2019t be adding things to peoples food without asking first. As an aside I would recommend you let friends know about a potentially dangerous cardiac issue if you expect to be in situations where it is relevant. If you had problems mid workout it would enable them to assist you better.", "NTA I don\u2019t have a heart problem and would be pissed if someone added pre-work to my protein shake. That stuff effects everyone differently and is a stimulate. Your \u201cfriend\u201d drugged you.", "NAH.

They drugged you.", "I\u2019m really sorry but YTA - you Dont have to tell your friends about your condition but you have to be aware if their not knowing, your friends are going to act like all other friends and do and act like you are any other person without a condition because this is what they know. Assuming that they were also drinking the same workout shake that include the caffeine they just wanted you to be there with them, they don\u2019t mean any harm.

I get that you shouldn\u2019t have to tell people all your medical business, but uhhhh caffeine is very common.

Like dang\u2026 you can\u2019t have an extra day off??", "NTA.  They have been told you don't consume caffeine, that should be enough for them to not drug you with caffeine.  The heart condition did not need to be a part of the discussion at all.  \n\nI don't consume caffeine because I don't like the way I feel afterwards.  It's not life threatening but it's my preference.  I'd still be royally pissed if someone snuck caffeine into my drink.

It doesn't sound like they added a spoonful of pure caffeine or anything.

Protein bars, apparently.) Had this been the case, YWNBTA.\n\nYour friends were trying to support and motivate you. They didn't know you had a problem.

So when the friend is asking you want a protein shake maybe try to let them know not to add anything to it. The reason you shouldn't keep something like that from your friends is for this very circumstance. I am sure that friend would have never given you the caffeinated  substance in your shake had they know not to. I don't see any assholes here, your friends really wanted to pup you up and motivate you which is great, but they would have not done this had they known you were having a bad day with your health... or that you are not to have stimulants. You should apologize to that friend for being angry at them. I am sure they feel awful after sending you to the hospital as it seems from their response to you.

Expecting people to notice patterns of \"I don't drink caffeine\" without explicitly stating it is extremely unrealistic. \n\nI have a friend who doesn't drink caffeine because he doesn't want to get on the caffeine cycle of needing it to feel perky.

Another of my friends called an ambulance for me. When I arrived at the hospital They asked me if I had taken any substances including caffeine. I told them no when my friend piped up and said yes I had. I was confused so I asked him and he told me that \"He put some pre-workout in my protein shake to try and lift me up a bit and make me come to the gym with them\" I was angry and I felt betrayed that he would do this behind my back without telling me. I told him I have a heart problem, at this point my other friends start to defend him and say that I should have told them, that there was no way for them to know I shouldn't take pre-workout.\n\nI had no serious problems from taking it and the doctor said I was all okay. I was still angry at my friend and the other friends for defending him. I said it wasn't cool he did it without telling me.
