We go about 3 to 4 times a week together.\n\nI also have a heart condition and I am advised not to take any stimulants like caffeine, I don't really like telling people I have a \"condition\" and this is what caused the problem.\n\nA week ago I was feeling slightly sick so I told my friends I was staying home and doing a small workout there.\n\nAbout an hour after I told them I heard a ring at my door and 3 of my friends were there saying they were going to encourage me to go to the gym.\n\nI told them I appreciate it but I won't be coming. I invited them inside anyway and we were just chilling out for a bit. One of my friends said he would make us all some protein shakes before they leave to go the gym. He asked if I wanted one and I agreed.\n\na few minutes after drinking mine I started to feel shaky. I wasn't sure what was going on, I told my friends my chest was feeling weird and they started to panic too. 25 minutes went by and I was not feeling any better I was panicking now and my chest was feeling tight. Another of my friends called an ambulance for me. When I arrived at the hospital They asked me if I had taken any substances including caffeine. I told them no when my friend piped up and said yes I had. I was confused so I asked him and he told me that \"He put some pre-workout in my protein shake to try and lift me up a bit and make me come to the gym with them\" I was angry and I felt betrayed that he would do this behind my back without telling me. I told him I have a heart problem, at this point my other friends start to defend him and say that I should have told them, that there was no way for them to know I shouldn't take pre-workout.\n\nI had no serious problems from taking it and the doctor said I was all okay. I was still angry at my friend and the other friends for defending him. I said it wasn't cool he did it without telling me. My other friends continue to defend him saying he couldn't have known not to. I have received a few comments that were hurtful calling me a baby for \"crying\" about it etc\n\nI feel like I am going crazy. Is it my fault for not telling them before hand? Did I overreact?\n\nEdit: It was my protein powder they used and have used multiple times", "created_utc": 1677793005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11geu1t/aita_for_not_telling_my_friends_about_a_heart/", "score": 351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First off, they invited themselves to your home when you told them you weren't feeling well. Then you are given a stimulant without your knowledge.

Send them this post if they keep harassing you.", "Do your friends known you don't consume caffeine?", "'saying he couldn't have known not to'. - exactly. That's why he shouldn't put things in people's food, he can't know what they have. (NTA)", "NTA. Your friend knowingly drugged you. So what that it was 'only' caffeine? It's still a mood altering substance that they didn't have explicit consent from you to include in the drink.\n\nAnd that's before we get into the toxicity of not respecting your boundaries. You, and you alone, get to decide if you're well enough to workout. 'Lets drug you to make you feel better so you can do X activity' is not respecting your boundaries, isn't acceptable, and that logic goes into some really dark places when you swap out 'caffeine' and 'workout' for other things.\n\nTime for new friends who don't feel like they're entitled to your medical history or the ability to decide how well you feel at any given time.", "INFO\n\nThey prepped the shake in your home, was it with your ingredients or something the friends brought over?", "NTA I can't believe what I'm reading here.  You were offered a protein smoothie not pre workout. He admits to sneaking it in there to get you to go to the gym. He didn't ask if you wanted some nor is this a normal thing in the smoothie. It's not even something you would have had in your house.\n\nYou never force people to eat things against their consent. It's wrong. You don't have to disclose your medical history to deserve that basic right. Lots of people don't know pre-workout has caffeine. He could know your full dietary restrictions and still fuck up.", "ESH if you have a life threatening condition, it is on YOU to make sure nothing you consume has caffeine in it. \n\nThey reacted poorly, but they\u2019re not wrong about how it\u2019s not their fault they didn\u2019t know.", "NTA.  You do not tamper with somebody else's food.  You ESPECIALLY do not do that to change their mood.  It didn't have to be caffeine; they would have been assholes for adding sugar, just as much.  You don't mess with other people's food.\n\nYour friends are assholes, and are doubling down on being assholes by getting mad at you.", "EDIT: Disregard. Friends are assholes, OP is NTA. Knowing now that it was the protein mix that OP kept in their own kitchen, your friend is 1000% the asshole for adding anything.\n\nHaving said that, I still think it\u2019s a good idea to let your workout partners/friends know about your condition just in case something happens at the gym and you need medical assistance.\n\n~~NAH, but this whole thing definitely could\u2019ve been handled better.~~\n\n~~On the one hand, your friend added an ingredient to your drink without letting you know, which isn\u2019t cool.~~\n\n~~On the other hand, it\u2019s a pretty common for workout-related drinks to have caffeine in them. If you have a heart condition that makes caffeine a no-no for you, it\u2019s your responsibility to inform someone who\u2019s preparing a shake for you so that they don\u2019t add something that you can\u2019t have, especially with caffeine being so common.~~\n\n~~No assholes, just a confluence of bad choices.~~", "INFO: did they know you had a dietary restriction of caffeine?", "Why didn't you ask what was in the protein shake?", "NTA.\n\nThere are *religions* that prohibit caffeine.  You never, *never* dose someone with *anything*, including caffeine, without consent.  \n\n(Only exception I can think of is a medical professional who knows what they're doing when there's an emergency.  Even then, best to get consent from next of kin.)", "Dude, I have a heart arrhythmia, and I can't have caffeine otherwise I risk an SVT and a trip to the emergency room. You need to let friends know about that. How were they supposed to know? Lots of things have caffeine in them.\n\nMild YTA. Please share info about your condition with your friends. Of course you are allowed privacy, but you also need to treat this like an allergy. That's critical info that you left out. Trust your friends.", "NTA... but you're not making a smart choice for knowing you have this health condition and yet taking food from others without questioning what's in it. You don't have to tell your friends about your condition, but you also can't expect them to make you a smoothie based on the dietary needs you haven't told them about.", "NTA all he said was that it was a protein shake, he needed to ask you before adding something", "NTA\n\nYou should not ever have to disclose medical info for people to not lie about what they are feeding you. Ditch these friends, they are not good people.", "NAH. Caffeine is a really common ingredient in workout supplements and is not dangerous for most people, so its reasonable that your friend didn\u2019t think to check with you, especially since you never mentioned you have a heart condition. It\u2019s also reasonable that you were upset after being surprised with caffeine given that you landed in the hospital. This all could have been avoided with more communication on both fronts.", "NTA. And these people are NOT your friends. A friend would not have put something in your drink without asking you. A friend would have been horrified to discover that they had given you something potentially harmful. A friend would not defend someone who caused you to go to the hospital in an ambulance. A friend would not call you a baby for objecting to all of the above. Also, a friend would offer to pay for your medical costs. I'm betting no such offer has been made.", "NAH. I also have a heart condition that means I need to limit caffeine (and do a whole bunch of other things), so I understand where you're coming from.\n\nYou are, of course, never obligated to disclose anything medical to anyone else. For that, NTA.\n\nYour friends should, of course, never sneak something into someone else's food. HOWEVER, it doesn't occur to most people (not us, of course, but most people) that a  caffeinated pre-workout is anywhere near the sort of thing that would be harmful, or that it's something a person would need to avoid. It's very convincing that this is an innocent mistake. (And I say this as someone who has experience similar things.) Especially in the context of someone making a shake to drink before working out, this isn't a super-wild action.\n\nNow: if you are so sensitive to caffeine that you HAVE TO AVOID IT or you will be hospitalized, you may want to actually consider notifying other people around you in the future, just like if you had a dangerous allergy. It's no one's business, but it's important for your own safety.", "ESH.\n\nIt wasn't right for your friend to add more ingredients to your protein shake without getting the okay from you first.\n\nHOWEVER, if you have a condition that could end up being life-threatening in more than one setting, you *need* to let people know, for your own health, so they can act appropriately if you have another one of these attacks, and what they should avoid so it doesn't happen again.", "ESH. \n\nOne simple reason for it too:\n\nA lack of communication.\nCaffine is a common stimulant in some foods and drinks, so the average person wouldn't think twice about if it's dangerous. If it is serious enough that it could hurt you, then there is no good reason to keep it from people you consider friends.it was an honest mistake that could've been avoided if you had simply been forthright.\n\nOn the other side, adding the caffeine to your drink without asking you was, at best thoughtless and at worst a violation of trust, though you have to admit there was no malicious intent. It was still very inappropriate.\n\nCommunication works both ways, and neither of you did so.", "Edit:  NTA based on the edit.  You should still tell your friends if you have a health issue and you are working out with them. I am actually leaning to ESH for two reasons.  You go to the gym with your friends regularly, they should know you have a heart condition in case something happens when there.  It is just common sense. \nSecond, these days, caffeine or other stimulants or herbs or whatnot in pre workout shakes is kind of a normal thing.  I wouldn't take one without asking exactly what they put in it.  If you asked and they lied, then NTA.  If you didn't ask, ESH.", "**ESH** but your friends are the FAR bigger AHs\n\nYou're a tiny bit of an AH because while no one is technically entitled to your personal medical information, your friends are clearly gym buddies who you work out with regularly, and their knowing that you have a serious heart condition is obviously relevant and potentially life-saving (or -threatening) information. More importantly (and crucial to your being an AH), the fact that you \"don't really like telling people\" in this context reeks of internalised ableism and the idea that admitting that you have a heart condition is somehow embarrassing or shameful. It's not. Health issues are value neutral. It's perpetuating stigma like this, and the idea that there's something embarrassing about having a health problem, that could have gotten you killed here.\n\nBut your friends are MASSIVE AHs because they literally poisoned you. No, they didn't know about your heart condition. Doesn't matter. You don't bloody well give someone preworkout, which often contains super questionable and sometimes dangerous ingredients even for healthy people (most pre-workout is classified under \"nutrition\" products and therefore are regulated by the FDA as \"food\", even though they can affect you just as much as drugs). Lots of supplements interact not only with health conditions but with medications and things. They should never have given you preworkout without your knowledge. That shit is not harmless.\n\nESH. You need to work on how you view your own and other people's health conditions and not seeing it as \"brokenness\" or something shameful. And they need to work on not putting things in other people's bodies without consent.", "NTA but that guy is a major AH and so are the friends defending him for slipping you a substance without your knowledge.", "NTA, yeah don't frat boy poison people's shit. He should have realized you don't take caffeine, and as also part of the 7% of people in America that can't have caffeine (or choose not to drink it) they should have noticed by now that you don't do caffeine.", "You're not the asshole for not telling them about your heart condition, but YTA for getting angry. \n\nThey added a pretty innocuous ingredient, how were they supposed to guess it would hurt you? People won't know these things if you don't tell them.", "I am actually surprised by all these comments and NO ONE has asked\u2026who puts pre workout in a protein shake?? Like\u2026is this normal?? I\u2019m not judging\u2026I just really wanna know", "NTA. Why are you friends with them? You are under no obligation to share personal information with anyone except a spouse or partner. They didn't need to know. But what makes this worse is that this incident happened because they were trying to force you to do what they wanted you to do; they had no respect for you. And in order to get you to comply, they pulled that underhanded stunt. You need better friends. No, cancel that-you need REAL friends.", "NTA I was going to say none here but your friends' reactions after the hospital trip makes them assholes.\nSure they definitely wouldn't have given you it if they knew, but you would have said no if they'd been honest about what they were making. \n\nIt's similar to having an allergy - if someone's making you a cup of tea, probably not going to mention if you're allergic to eggs, for example, but if they're offering cake too would say no thanks.", "NTA but your friends are. They essentially drugged you without your knowledge. That\u2019s fucked up.", "NTA. Your friends are mild AHs. Adding an ingredient to your your shake when it was prepared in your home with your protein powder is not cool. There are loads of reasons someone may not want to take caffeine. Being supportive is great. Giving your friends supplements without asking is not showing support in an appropriate way. Hopefully this can be a learning experience for your friends. They shouldn\u2019t be adding things to peoples food without asking first. As an aside I would recommend you let friends know about a potentially dangerous cardiac issue if you expect to be in situations where it is relevant. If you had problems mid workout it would enable them to assist you better.", "NTA I don\u2019t have a heart problem and would be pissed if someone added pre-work to my protein shake. That stuff effects everyone differently and is a stimulate. Your \u201cfriend\u201d drugged you.", "NAH. I get why you were hiding such information from them, but doing so also meant they didn't have the information they need to support you in the right way.", "ESH- this is just bad communication all around.", "NTA. They drugged you.", "I\u2019m really sorry but YTA - you Dont have to tell your friends about your condition but you have to be aware if their not knowing, your friends are going to act like all other friends and do and act like you are any other person without a condition because this is what they know. Assuming that they were also drinking the same workout shake that include the caffeine they just wanted you to be there with them, they don\u2019t mean any harm. I can 100% understand why you were stressed upon realising that you took this but I Dont think this is on them", "NTA - you shouldn't have to tell your friends about health issues, they just shouldn't spike your food.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to share your medical information with people and your \u201cfriends\u201d shouldn\u2019t be slipping you stimulants because they think you need to perk up", "YOu don't have to tell anyone about your health. \n\never. ever. ever. ever. ever.", "YTA. I'm likely going to get downvoted and people are going to say you aren't and act like he was poisoning you with the pre-workout, but it's a harmless substance for 99.99% of the population the same way every other ingredient in the milkshake that he also didn't disclose is. \n\nYes, it's generally a shitty move to add things to other people's food or drinks, but if your condition, and that is what it is regardless of your feeling about the wordage, is so severe that putting the wrong thing in a drink can kill you, it's on you to make that clear. Especially to friends who are close enough to show up at your home with the intentions of motivating you for gym time.\n\nYou are all the assholes for drinking a protein shake before the gym.\n\nQuick-ish edit: I'm actually surprised by all the E-S-H/YTA in this thread, a lot of Redditors act like pre-workout is a steroid-grade toxin when talkinga bout fitness.\n\nEdit 2: After re-reading the story, I'm leaning more towards fake than anything else. There are just too many things not adding up. The protein shakes before the workout is a red flag as is OP's friend making four servings of it in someone else's home. It would also be extremely coincidental if the protein flavor was something that could completely mask what in my experience across the board has been incredibly strong and sharp tasting fruity pre-workout flavors. OP has a heart condition, was hurting to the point of a friend calling an ambulance (why didn't one of them just drive him to the hospital), yet still didn't mention the heart condition until he was at the hospital meaning the ambulance didn't do any sort of triage AND that he didn't say anything in the 30+ minutes that his HEART was hurting at home. And luckily OP's care provider was asking about his medical history with the shake spiker and the other friends right there.", "In this situation, yes, YTA. You didn't make your dietary restrictions clear. It is your responsibility to make sure you don't eat or drink anything that could harm your health.\n\nYou're not TA for withholding health information - nobody has a right to that - but you are for getting mad at them for not knowing about the dietary restrictions you didn't advise them of.\n\nETA: yes, he added pre-workout to your protein shake, but that's honestly so innocuous. According to your comments, you have never, *ever* outright told people you can't have caffeine. You've also been working out with these guys without telling them you have a heart condition, which could be life-threatening during cardio exercises. \n\nPeople need to be aware of things that could harm you. You don't get to explode in anger at people for making mistakes, if you won't trust them enough to warn them beforehand. Yeah, he shouldn't have put in the pre-workout without asking you, but in the context of you guys being gym buddies, theoretically prepping to go to the gym, it is a pretty innocent mistake. You are the far bigger AH in this situation.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, this is a life-threatening allergy for you.", "ESH. I get that you shouldn\u2019t have to tell people all your medical business, but uhhhh caffeine is very common. I don\u2019t see why you didn\u2019t treat this like an allergy situation and let people close to you know about that. Not your friends\u2019 fault that they didn\u2019t know. I do think it\u2019s annoying that your friend decided upon slipping in extra ingredients just because he wants to convince you to go to the gym. Like dang\u2026 you can\u2019t have an extra day off??", "NTA.  They have been told you don't consume caffeine, that should be enough for them to not drug you with caffeine.  The heart condition did not need to be a part of the discussion at all.  \n\nI don't consume caffeine because I don't like the way I feel afterwards.  It's not life threatening but it's my preference.  I'd still be royally pissed if someone snuck caffeine into my drink.  The fact that they came to pressure you to go to the gym when you weren't feeling well is bad enough, but drugging my drink like that would have them ex-friends faster than they can exit the building.", "Unless they knew that you couldn't have caffeine, YTA for how you reacted.\n\nYour friends didn't know that it would be a problem - it sounds like this \"pre-workout\" is something that they regularly take.  It doesn't sound like they added a spoonful of pure caffeine or anything. While a Google search shows that most protein shakes don't have caffeine in them, enough to do at least ask question unless you make it yourself. (Another surprising item w/ caffeine? Protein bars, apparently.) Had this been the case, YWNBTA.\n\nYour friends were trying to support and motivate you. They didn't know you had a problem. If you were well enough to do \"a small workout at home\", perhaps a bit of encouragement from friends might be just enough to motivate you to go to the gym. They are NTA for trying to help you with your fitness journey.", "YTA... BUT you probably know that the work out stuff sometimes has caffeine I would think? So when the friend is asking you want a protein shake maybe try to let them know not to add anything to it. The reason you shouldn't keep something like that from your friends is for this very circumstance. I am sure that friend would have never given you the caffeinated  substance in your shake had they know not to. I don't see any assholes here, your friends really wanted to pup you up and motivate you which is great, but they would have not done this had they known you were having a bad day with your health... or that you are not to have stimulants. You should apologize to that friend for being angry at them. I am sure they feel awful after sending you to the hospital as it seems from their response to you.

Expecting people to notice patterns of \"I don't drink caffeine\" without explicitly stating it is extremely unrealistic. \n\nI have a friend who doesn't drink caffeine because he doesn't want to get on the caffeine cycle of needing it to feel perky. You could have also said you have an allergy to caffeine, which is a close approximation to the side effects if you drank it. \n\nThem not knowing and accidentally exposing you to something that can kill you when it's normally a totally harmless supplement is in fact on you.", "Op, I have supraventricular tachycardia and cannot have caffeine.

You really aren\u2019t in a position to be seriously angry at your friends for this. On the other hand, it\u2019s normal to get a bit worked up when experiencing health issues, and assuming you were calmly communicating that you felt angry/betrayed, your friends really overreacted by calling you a baby/etc, and are TA for that and that alone.

We go about 3 to 4 times a week together.\n\nI also have a heart condition and I am advised not to take any stimulants like caffeine, I don't really like telling people I have a \"condition\" and this is what caused the problem.\n\nA week ago I was feeling slightly sick so I told my friends I was staying home and doing a small workout there.\n\nAbout an hour after I told them I heard a ring at my door and 3 of my friends were there saying they were going to encourage me to go to the gym.\n\nI told them I appreciate it but I won't be coming. I invited them inside anyway and we were just chilling out for a bit. One of my friends said he would make us all some protein shakes before they leave to go the gym. He asked if I wanted one and I agreed.\n\na few minutes after drinking mine I started to feel shaky. I wasn't sure what was going on, I told my friends my chest was feeling weird and they started to panic too. 25 minutes went by and I was not feeling any better I was panicking now and my chest was feeling tight. Another of my friends called an ambulance for me. When I arrived at the hospital They asked me if I had taken any substances including caffeine. I told them no when my friend piped up and said yes I had. I was confused so I asked him and he told me that \"He put some pre-workout in my protein shake to try and lift me up a bit and make me come to the gym with them\" I was angry and I felt betrayed that he would do this behind my back without telling me. I told him I have a heart problem, at this point my other friends start to defend him and say that I should have told them, that there was no way for them to know I shouldn't take pre-workout.\n\nI had no serious problems from taking it and the doctor said I was all okay. I was still angry at my friend and the other friends for defending him. I said it wasn't cool he did it without telling me. My other friends continue to defend him saying he couldn't have known not to. I have received a few comments that were hurtful calling me a baby for \"crying\" about it etc\n\nI feel like I am going crazy. Is it my fault for not telling them before hand? Did I overreact?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Or might you even not really notice her declining banana in her smoothies on a few occasions and so not make any assumptions regarding her relationship to that particular fruit?\n\nLook, you don't have to explain the details of your heart condition to anyone if you don't want to, but you can't then turn around and get angry at people for not knowing things you've gone out of your way to hide from them. You never told your friends that you can't ingest caffeine. Caffeine is in a lot of things, and for the overwhelming majority of people, it's entirely benign. I can certainly understand why you got scared, but I think you are focusing on your anger at your friends in an effort to avoid focusing on the fear you felt when you didn't know why you were feeling so strange (and perhaps that you frequently feel due to the constant presence of your heart condition in your life and mind). It's displacement. And it's inappropriate and unjustified; *they didn't know, and they had no way of knowing, because you hid it from them.* You could have simply told people, years ago, that you can't have caffeine; if they asked why, you've never actually been obligated to tell them. You could have called it an allergy (it's equivalent to one), or said that it makes you feel sick, or that you just don't like it. But when you've not given anyone any reason to know that you can't have it, you are the only one to blame for them not knowing it.\n\nYTA.", "I do not understand any of these comments. \n\nOP, someone could have accidentally caused your death.

And you certainly have zero right to get all huffy over it. \n\nCan you imagine the level of guilt that your FRIEND could have suffered had you died? \n\nIt\u2019s YOUR responsibility to disclose a serious health condition should you inadvertently ingest a commonly used item in the course of that activity.\n\nGeez. Take responsibility. \nIf I were that friend, I\u2019d eventually realize that what you withheld was completely unfair to me and without any regard for the burden I would have had to live with.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a peanut allergy.

It doesn't matter if you told them or didn't that x was an allergen or something you just can't tolerate. \n\nThis guy came to your house with the ***express purpose of sneaking something into your food.***  He was at home, concocted this plan, put some caffeinated powder in a bag, came to your house, made an offer of a shake to you knowing he was lying, mixed up the drink knowing you had not approved his addition, gave it to you and let you drink it. All the while knowing he was lying. \n\nSubstitute some other substance for caffeine and some other activity for working out. Imagine he snuck sugar into a diabetic's home and into their food. Would it matter if he knew the person was diabetic? Only to make the judgement worse. He would still be an utter asshole. \n\nFor an analogy they may understand more, I read a story about someone putting their period blood into the food their spouse consumed (doesn't matter if it really happened). The spouse wasn't hurt by it at all and found out accidentally. Would they be ok with that? It injured the spouse less than the caffeine did you after all. They didn't have to go to the doctor. Would they make fun of the spouse for being upset by it or agree that tampering is bad even if the person isn't hurt?\n\nIt may not be on the same level as putting poison in someone's drink but the spirit is certainly there. His intent was to force you to consume something, and he didn't care if it might be harmful to you. Frankly I think you need a new group of 'friends' because these sound horrific. One doses you with something without consent and the rest make fun of you for being upset as if you not dying from it somehow makes that ok.", "Ummmm if you died, this would be manslaughter or negligent homicide, right? NTA. You don\u2019t give someone a substance they aren\u2019t aware of. Period. He basically roofied your protein shake and they got mad at you?? Shitty friends.", "I don't have to be told someone has a condition to know that I shouldn't surprise dose them with anything. NTA. Lose the friends and find you some better ones.", "NTA. They drugged your drink. Not cool.", "NTA. They drugged you. That is scary even without a heart condition.", "NTA. As someone who cannot process caffeine, I am 100% with you. They drugged you, it\u2019s that simple. You don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation about your health. Might be time to find some new friends, especially given how they treated you after the fact\u2026", "I have diabetes and high blood pressure issues. Plus ADHD and other stuff.\n\nCaffeine makes my heart flutter. And makes me sleepy. \n\nI've had a moment where I didn't know there was caffeine in my pre-workout drink and it put me down hard. Chest hurt. Drowsy. No energy. I passed out on the treadmill and scared my buddy badly. I learned my lesson on trying drinks folks give me.", ">I told them I appreciate it but I won't be coming. I invited them inside anyway and we were just chilling out for a bit.\n\nSounds like they were invited in.", "Not just a stimulant, but a natural insecticide. Apparently when bugs consume caffeine plants their metabolisms rev up like crazy and they die. \n\nDefinitely not something to slip to anyone.", "It's exactly like those idiots who like to test out whether someone is reeeeeeally allergic to peanuts ...", "First time I had pre-workout, I texted my trainer that I was having an allergic reaction to something and was going to urgent care. He figured out it the lip tingling and racing heartbeat was the pre-workout. I can\u2019t imagine giving that to another person and not telling them what it was. What a bunch of jerks.", "Not just the additional ingredients, it\u2019s you need to let your gym buddies know so if you\u2019re now on the ground we know how to help. Self preservation trumps privacy in these situations.", "Sorry, I read it as \"OP's protein powder\" and missed that the friend added to it. My bad.", "Ohhhh someone did that to me but with pineapple became the asshole didn\u2019t believe me when I told him am allergic to it because it\u2019s pineappleeeeeee.", "Now you have me wondering how you'd pronounce pineappleeeeeee.", ">They weren't owed the information\n\nYeah, til you end up on the floor, and they've got no clue what's wrong or what to tell the EMTs.\n\nSome medical information deserves privacy; other information is practical to give out.  This is the latter.", "At least its not another wedding post.", "From a previous post in which excellent points are made.\n\n[Yes. There is no obligation to disclose. \n\nDid you notice that in this case, the food was prepared in OP's kitchen? This all happened at OP's house and the friends came over. Literally there was nothing with caffeine in there unless the friends brought it in. And unless the friend brought the protein shake mix, OP knew exactly what was supposed to be in it and what wasn't.\n\nEDIT: OP confirmed in another comment - this was his protein powder from his kitchen, he had no reason to think would contain caffeine.]", "\"pineappleeeeeee\"", "They used his protein powder in his kitchen. He had no reason to believe he'd be drugged.", "I don't see much of a difference here.  They work differently in the body, but the effect is still the same: ingesting a certain substance is dangerous.", "You like literally said it right there though. You said that the friend should have asked first regardless which is why OP was rightfully mad. And it was sneaking what do you call secretly putting something in someone\u2019s drink purposely without telling them. And I\u2019m gonna say it one more time before I believe you\u2019ll never get it. But OP was not mad that they did not know his allergies but that they went behind his back and snuck something into his drink because they couldn\u2019t handle him declining to go to the gym with them because he has the right to say no.", "I mean to the extent that op wasn't obliged to disclose his private medical information because based on what he's said here they are workout buddies, so they aren't typically preparing food for each other. Moreover, op was in a setting (his home) where it was reasonable.to assume there was no caffeine because he doesn't keep caffeine in his home. People have a host of reasons to not want to share that they have a chronic illness-- and too in that list is that people often behave differently when they know about it and usually worry and pity the person with a chronic illness. If it were a peanut allergy I'd have a different opinion because that is an allergy that can be triggered by trace amounts and even particles in the air or left in surfaces for some very allergic people. That isn't the case with caffeine and heart disease so I don't think op was wrong to keep his private health issues private.", "The difference is hes not going to die from someone cooking for him at a restaurant with the same utensils they used for something with caffeine, whereas an allergy requires separate cooking surfaces and utensils as trace amounts can cause a reaction.\n\nYou (should) warn people about an allergy for that reason. You can ask if something has caffeine without revealing a heart condition.", "No because he didn't get the caffeine from ops kitchen. He used ops protein powder and added something that he brought over. There's never an acceptable reason to add things to people's food without saying something. OP had no reason to believe there would be caffeine in his drink because he hadn't brought caffeine into his home. It would have been totally different if he was at someone else's house or eating out, but that was not the case here.", "You're arguing against a point I didn't make", "No they're making one. OPs \"friends\" brought an extra ingredient and snuck it in. No doubt they knew OP didn't drink caffeine. If they've been over enough to know where everything is to make a protein shake, they knew OP didn't drink caffeine.", "Alright sorry, this vagina haver woman who has XX chromosomes definitely poisons her friends and gets pissy when they almost die"]}
