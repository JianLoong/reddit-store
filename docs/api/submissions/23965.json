The area to return carts was about twelve feet away so that really pissed me off since it's probably going to roll away and bump into someone's car. She wasn't disabled or anything like that. She was just lazy. \n\nHer window was open, so I said, 'hey, you forgot to put your shopping cart away.\"\n\nShe gave me a dirty look and said, 'you put it away if you care about it so damn much.'\n\nSo I said, 'fine,' and I picked it up and put it in the flatbed of her truck. She exploded out of her truck and started screaming at me at the top of her lungs, ordering me to get it out and all that. I just ignored her and walked to my car. She ran to get a worker and I put my stuff in my trunk and rolled the cart back to where it fucking belonged unlike her. \n\nSo this skinny young kid who works there is standing in the back of her truck and trying to lift it out while she's screaming at him about me. I'm a really big guy and it was heavy for me, so I didn't know how he was going to do it. I never found out, because I quickly left and that was that.\n\nOr, so I thought. Well, this lady got a picture of me when I was driving out and she posted it on my community's Facebook group with a huge post saying shit about me, claiming that I threatened her life and that I scared her. She also posted a picture of a dent in her truck, but I have no idea where that came from. Maybe it happened when the workers took the cart out, or maybe she's just lying? Now, my wife is super pissed at me, saying that I should have just minded my own business and now her friends and the parents of my kid's friends are going to see it and she's humiliated. She said I was being an asshole and that I shouldn't have touched someone's property like that. I was just trying to get her to stop being so selfish. AITA here? I don't think I am.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1691271784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15j7ngu/aita_for_putting_a_shopping_cart_in_the_back_of/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, you suck, too. You don't have the right to put the cart in her truck because you could either damage the vehicle (call your insurance agency to get their view on it if you don't believe me) and/or make someone who did absolutely nothing wrong (the store employee) have to deal with both you and the woman.

I think that failed spectacularly. You didn't take any of the responsibility of doing so and made it someone else's problem and even subjected them to her screaming. Also if that thing was as heavy as you say it was I fully believe that either lifting it in or out would dent her truck. The internet will applaud you for this but in real life they won't.", "NTA, you\u2019re my hero! I think every retailer should follow the Aldi model of charging 0.25 for a cart. You NEVER see a random cart in their parking lot. Honestly, people who have nothing better to do than spend all their time on neighborhood facebook groups and nextdoor being nosey and complaining need to get a life. Tell your wife that in less than 48 hours this will be completely forgotten because there will be plenty new drama for everyone to complain and moralize over. And Re the cart person, if they were unable to safely remove the cart they should have asked for assistance.", "YTA.\n\nYou took it too far.\n\nBlocking someone in with a cart either in front of / or behind them so they can't move is fine, but putting it into the bed of their vehicle is major A H territory.\n\nWhislt not as bad as those \"pranksters\" who created shopping cart barriers using multiple carts, putting it in the bed is still an A H move", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
