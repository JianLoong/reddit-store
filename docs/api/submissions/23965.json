The area to return carts was about twelve feet away so that really pissed me off since it's probably going to roll away and bump into someone's car. She wasn't disabled or anything like that. She was just lazy. \n\nHer window was open, so I said, 'hey, you forgot to put your shopping cart away.\"\n\nShe gave me a dirty look and said, 'you put it away if you care about it so damn much.'\n\nSo I said, 'fine,' and I picked it up and put it in the flatbed of her truck. She exploded out of her truck and started screaming at me at the top of her lungs, ordering me to get it out and all that. I just ignored her and walked to my car. She ran to get a worker and I put my stuff in my trunk and rolled the cart back to where it fucking belonged unlike her. \n\nSo this skinny young kid who works there is standing in the back of her truck and trying to lift it out while she's screaming at him about me. I'm a really big guy and it was heavy for me, so I didn't know how he was going to do it. I never found out, because I quickly left and that was that.\n\nOr, so I thought. Well, this lady got a picture of me when I was driving out and she posted it on my community's Facebook group with a huge post saying shit about me, claiming that I threatened her life and that I scared her. She also posted a picture of a dent in her truck, but I have no idea where that came from. Maybe it happened when the workers took the cart out, or maybe she's just lying? Now, my wife is super pissed at me, saying that I should have just minded my own business and now her friends and the parents of my kid's friends are going to see it and she's humiliated. She said I was being an asshole and that I shouldn't have touched someone's property like that. I was just trying to get her to stop being so selfish. AITA here?
