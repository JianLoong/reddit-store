{"id": 18917, "submission_id": "13zpwem", "title": "AITA for requesting reimbursement for an unplanned ride share after an arrangement fell through?", "selftext": "My cousin and I are both 24-year-old males. He has been ill off and on for the last year and needed a bone marrow transplant. I was a match so I agreed to be his donor. The arrangement was for me to stay in a hotel, then my aunt and/or uncle were going to pick me up, take me to the hospital (where my cousin also is) for the procedure and drive me back to the hotel once I was discharged since I had to go under anesthesia.\n\nI completed the discharge process about two hours or so after waking and waited in one of the hospital waiting rooms for my aunt or uncle to take me back to the hotel. They let me know via text that the transplant was starting and they wanted to stay with my cousin for a while to make sure it started off okay, which was completely understandable.\n\nTwo hours passed and I didn't hear from them. I was trying not to be rude or pushy because I know they're stressed, but I asked if one of them would be able to drive me soon, and also asked if everything was going okay on his end (I was getting worried). At this point I was in pretty bad pain and felt like I needed to lie down so I wanted to get back to the hotel (which was 5 blocks away). \n\nTwo more hours passed and I didn't hear anything. I sent them one more text saying I was leaving and called a ride share which ended up being way more expensive than I thought it would be. Slept at the hotel and got home earlier today. This morning I saw on social media that the transplant had gone well, so I'm still not sure why they never responded. I sent them a payment request with a note: \"Unexpected ride share expense, glad everything went well.\"\n\nI received the following message in response:\n\n\"You are a heartless AH for trying to extort money from us at a time like this. You could have waited a little longer and we would have taken you back to your hotel. It was your choice to spend your money.\"\n\nI tried to explain that I had was in pain and feeling unwell for 4 hours without hearing a word so they left me with little choice but to find another ride back to the hotel, to which they responded, \"Your discomfort doesn't compare to ours or \\[my cousin's\\]. We will not be guilted into giving into this extortion.\"\n\nI get it. They're going through a hard time, but AITA? \n\nP.S. The hotel stay was free because of my travel rewards but I took unpaid time off work for this too, so my own finances are a little tight.", "created_utc": 1685827004, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13zpwem/aita_for_requesting_reimbursement_for_an/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can\u2019t believe anyone would act like that to someone that just donated to save their child\u2019s life.

Wow, those are some seriously ungrateful people. My head spins. Whatever the outcome, not only are you NTA, you sound like one of the good guys to me. Maybe when your cousin is back on his feet he'll set them straight. He should!", "NTA - wow, you are a good person for donating bone marrow!", "NTA at all!! You donated your bone marrow to their son and they didn\u2019t have an inch of gratefulness to take care of you and ensure you\u2019re well rested. Absolute shame on them. All they could do is wait outside the operating room so there\u2019s no reason to not spare 30 mins to drive you 5 blocks away to get some rest.", "NTA. They are huge AH for \"your discomfort doesn't compare to ours or cousin's.\" A ride to the hotel is the least they could've done.", "NTA\n\nYou generously offered a literal part of your body to save their son, they let you leave the hospital unassisted after your part of the procedure, and they\u2019re calling *you* heartless?!\n\n*And* they claim that their discomfort is greater?!\n\nYour cousin is going to be mortified when he finds out how selfish his parents were. Are.\n\nOP, you are the opposite of an AH. The absolute complete opposite.", "NTA-they shouldn\u2019t have gone MIA-especially when they were sitting in a waiting room probably distracting themselves with their phones. They also should have kept you informed on the cousin\u2019s progress which you asked about. SM isn\u2019t the place to find out the results. I think you have no choice but to go LC with them. They got what they wanted out of you, so clearly they don\u2019t care about you anymore. I wouldn\u2019t drag the cousin into it. Way down the road, maybe you can clear the air with him, but I wouldn\u2019t anytime soon. \n\nThe aunt and uncle are more AHs for not replying than for not paying the bill. Then their reply to the request was horrific. They aren\u2019t your friend-they are an aunt/uncle-parental generation. A little concern for you could have gone a long way given what you\u2019ve done for their son. I notice that they never bothered to check on you at all after the procedure. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have sent them a payment request without talking to them, but of all the things that were wrong in this story, your request was the least AHish of them all.", "NTA. Hope they don\u2019t want you to transplant again", "Wow. You go there and literally save their son's life, and they can't reimburse you for a taxi after betraying their word? NTA, what a bunch of ingrates.", "NTA. \n\nMarrow donation procedures are notoriously painful. I get that they wanted to be there for their son but you made a lot of sacrifices to be there for your cousin.  \n\nOne parent could have stayed around the hospital waiting room. The other should have taken you back immediately and even got you lunch/dinner whatever you needed to recover.  Once your cousin got out of his procedure that parent could have left you for the night. \n\nI feel vicariously embarrassed for their behavior. It's incredibly shameful.", "They never intended to drive you back. They had no further need of you. NTA", "NTA.  The hotel stay WASN'T free if you had to use reward points for it, those have value.  You expended quite a bit of time and resources for their benefit but they didn't appreciate it or reciprocate.", "NTA. One of them couldn\u2019t step away for 10 mins to drive you? Ffs. From what I\u2019ve heard, donating bone marrow isn\u2019t exactly comfortable. They are beyond ungrateful.", "INFO: To your knowledge, how are your aunt and uncle\u2019s finances, especially considering what they may have been paying all along for your cousin\u2019s medical care?", "NTA\u2026 but given this is family are you prepared for this to be the hill you die on? \n\nIt must have been really shitty for them to go MIA while you were in pain.

It was the least they could do for you. I just can\u2019t believe how they are speaking to you after what you did to help their child! Absolutely disgusting and they should be ashamed of themselves. Imagine taking a gift like that and refusing to do the bare minimum in return. Shameful.", "NTA they seem to forget that you went through a bone marrow donation that can have side effects and definitely causes pain.  They should be incredibly grateful to you", "This fight doesn\u2019t make sense.  They should have offered to get you an Uber, but they didn\u2019t.  A five block ride couldn\u2019t be that expensive that it would break the bank.  You did they right thing, but they are not grateful.  Not worth your energy to insist on reimbursement.  In fact it sounds like they are not worth your energy in general.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m sorry. You had a whole medical procedure, extracting something *from your bones*, for their child, who did not have a life threatening illness, for free and of your own volition, and they couldn\u2019t give to the decency of a ride? And to top it off, they think that \u2018your discomfort doesn\u2019t compare to ours\u2019 and that you\u2019re \u2018trying to extort\u2019 them?\n\nDisgusting. Beyond disgusting. They\u2019re lucky they didn\u2019t have to pay for your hotel and flight. I hope your cousin is suitably thankful and equally mortified. \n\nFrankly, following this, I\u2019d be petty, and comment on the social media post. Something like \u2018great it went well, happy to help with the marrow donation\u2019 - that\u2019ll take allllll the attention off them, which I suspect they\u2019ll absolutely hate, and make you the hero. I know it\u2019s not why you did it, and it won\u2019t get your money back, but it might reimburse you for a bit of emotional distress.", "Nta. They got what they wanted from you and discarded you.", "NTA - I would remind them that you went under to donate bone marrow to their son. Something you did not have to do. You lost wages, were not reimbursed for hotel expenses, & were left in limbo in pain after the procedure. \n\nI feel like a normal parent would have paid all your expenses up front. Are they broke? I also don\u2019t see how this is extortion? I think they are confused with the term.", "NTA!\n\nOne of them couldn\u2019t run you to the hotel or order a ride-share they paid for?

They knew exactly what they were doing and I doubt they ever planned on actually driving him to his hotel at all.", "Thanks but I'm no hero, lol. Just the right thing to do. ;)", "The cousin\u2019s\u2014sure, but theirs????", "[removed]", "Unless it was thousands of dollars, it seems like a small price to pay for someone's bone marrow transplant.
