Are you the AH for wanting to see your sister who is mentally ill? No. Are you the AH for trying to see her directly after work? No. Are you the AH for trying to see her and give her a sense that someone cares? No. On the other hand, you refused to change out of your uniform, didn't take into effect that other mentally ill patients maybe triggered into a episode because they have had negative encounters with police, and had to get the staff and security involved just because you had to act all high and mighty and refuse to simply change out of a uniform.\n\nFor those reasons overall, YTA. You aren't a AH for wanting to visit a mentally ill family member, but she's not the only patient their. It's a psychiatric wing; a good deal of the patients in the wing are mentally ill and easily triggered.

He was suggested an appropriate alternative and he still declined out of stubbornness.", "Because he could have come another time without his uniform. By insisting on entering, he put other patients at risk. What part of THAT is difficult?", "Hopefully, he's got a small amount of compassion and doesn't enjoy terrorizing vulnerable people? Sure, he's allowed to stomp his way in there and cause several mentally ill people a great deal of distress, but unless you're a completely selfish monster, why would you want to do so?", "I understand what you are saying. But I think you are wrong. Badly wrong.", "It\u2019s OP\u2019s problem because of the setting and situation. If OP is in uniform at Krispy Kreme and someone asks him to change because his cop uniform is triggering them, he\u2019s not in the wrong by refusing because they are completely able to leave and both parties have equal rights to exist in a public space and those of us with triggers generally are responsible for managing our exposure ourselves if able. In this circumstance, the folks OP is triggering are in a healthcare setting specifically because they\u2019re experiencing heightened mental health issues and they are locked in, they can\u2019t leave or escape the trigger. It\u2019s far from abnormal to be asked to change something about your clothing when visiting a psych unit, or being held on one. With units I\u2019ve been a patient on and others I\u2019ve worked on, there\u2019s usually a dress code.", ">  I don't think op has an obligation to accommodate them when he didn't know.\n\nThis is not about an arbitrary  \"dress code\"  it's about avoiding mental distress to mental patients. The two cases are utterly different.  His ignorance of the rule is irrelevant.The fact remains, ignoring the rule can do damage.  *And Op doesn't care*. OP literally doesn't care if his behaviour causes distress. That makes him an asshole. Expecting someone else to cover his uniform for him makes him an asshole.", "No, if it\u2019s that big of a deal, they should have it on their website or whatever. Obviously it\u2019s not that do or die if op was able to go in after seeing the doctor or security guard. I\u2019m not saying that op should just go there all the time in the uniform but, if they don\u2019t give the opportunity to lay the ground rules before someone is already inside the building, they should probably offer alternatives. Just a jacket or whatever for someone to wear.", "If something triggers patients it would be a good idea to state on the website or some form that you should not have that thing when you enter. Not sure what you are saying abt clown shirts and spider rings but police are everywhere. It\u2019s a very common profession and there\u2019s a high chance that one would enter the building as a visitor. I\u2019m guessing there isn\u2019t too many types of clothing that are very triggering so yes, if there are known types of triggering clothing or uniforms, they should state that somewhere.", "And again like I\u2019ve said many times before on here, if they have a specific dress code that no one can know before hand, they should just have a jacket or scrubs someone can change into before entering. It\u2019s a very easy fix.", "Ok, I think I'm convinced. I'm going to edit my original comment to space out the judgment so it doesn't count.", "He already explain why taking off the button down shirt would not do any good. Either way, he\u2019s not obligated to do so. It\u2019s their rule, and so they need to provide some sort of a jacket or covering for him to wear.", "The part where it\u2019s not his responsibility to protect those patients. It\u2019s a very strange policy, if it even exists. He\u2019s not obligated to forgo his visit and waste his trip there because some people are triggered. They have hospital gowns. They should\u2019ve offered to provide him with one.  \n\nSeems like something like this would\u2019ve come down from the Director of the facility and not some random doctor or nurse. Again, there should be notices informing people of this on their website and their socials.", "He didn\u2019t terrorize anyone. He went to go visit his sister.", "You\u2019re entitled to think what you like. But if you want to have an intelligent conversation, then you need to articulate the reasons why you think I\u2019m wrong.", "Actually, the Krispy Kreme is more in the right because that\u2019s private property. They can refuse service to anyone.\n\nBoth parties have equal rights to exist in a public space; which means that one party does not have the right to impose theyPersonal issues on the other one.\n\nDoes this trigger extend to other human categories? There\u2019s an Orthodox Jew, how to remove his kippah and tuck in his side curls if there is an Arab who is triggered by Jews? \n\nWhat if a couple of white people were robbed by Black people and are triggered? Does a black visitor have to conceal his racial identity?\n\nObviously, Race and Religion are different than an occupation. But either way, the patients are still vulnerable. So what do we do with those cases?", ">This is not about an arbitrary \"dress code\" it's about avoiding mental distress to mental patients.\n\nIt's obviously about a dress code lol. They find his dress code inappropriate. If they want to avoid mental distress to the patients  THEY need to inform visitors of the rules. Like I said if it's a fast and hard rule they need to tell visitors prior to them showing up. \n\nWhat do they do to police who are there on official police business? What about other uniforms that might be triggering to the patients?", "> Obviously it\u2019s not that do or die if op was able to go in after seeing the doctor or security guard.\n\nNo security guard is going to physically prevent a cop wearing a sherrif's star from doing what they want. They want to keep their job and their life.\n\n>if they don\u2019t give the opportunity to lay the ground rules before someone is already inside the building...\n\nEvery building has reception and security in the foyer, not in the street. They are there to prevent unwelcome people entering too far in, into the sensitive parts of a building.\n\nI cannot understand why everyone is defending this.", "I can guarantee you that the people who brought OPs sister in were made to sign a form that explicitly explains the rules and that those rules are also easily accessible on their website.\n\nIt's a receptionist's job to show the door to anyone who doesn't comply with them.\n\nAs Ency already told you: \"ignorance is not an defence\". Especially not \\*after\\* being told.\n\nEspecially not given that this wasn't the first time OP had been there.", ":-) yay!", "And I already explained why that excuse was bollocks. The motif on the t-shirt wouldn't have been immediately recognisable to most, unlike the jacket. The staff on site deemed it sufficient. \n\nHe's not obligated by law to remove it but that isn't the purpose of this sub. He was advised of the risks and provided an adequate alternative with little to no inconvenience to him. His refusal based on these terms is why he's an AH.\n\nThe staff don't need to provide shit, however, did he actually request alternative clothing?", "\"Not his responsibility.\" That's pathetic. He was told what the problem was, and was too self important to come back, or take off the t-shirt and turn it inside-out. Wonderful to see how caring people can be.", "I have articulated it across several comments. I have pissed myself dry. If I haven't convinced you yet, I have run out of arguments. That doesn't mean you win, it just means I am wasting my time.", "The store employees could refuse service, another customer has no ability to do so. In both examples the reason for the request is to accommodate the needs of a consumer, not the folks in charge.\n\nRace and religion are completely different from occupation and don\u2019t really work to make your argument here. A cop isn\u2019t a category of human, it\u2019s a job and very easily covered or changed. I would have insisted the tshirt option was fine, and requested OP turn the shirt inside out. I don\u2019t think you understand what level of chaos and risk of injury can happen on a locked unit. The person advocating to OP for the patients on the unit does. In the case of an inescapable trigger such as you describe, usually it would be planned for ahead of time and staff would separate patients accordingly, like a 1:1 staff member taking the trigger risk patient for a walk or activity or whatever.", "Physically preventing would be the security guard having to hold her back. She was perfectly prevented from entering, until they let her through.", "You completely skipped the part about offering a solution like a jacket. You know, the right thing to do. And yeah, a doctor will try to stop a cop from entering the building if it\u2019s that serious. It\u2019s not like op was charging down the hallway. It looks like they were just waiting at the front desk talking.", "Yes, if the rules are stated then op is an asshole. Op never said they were so we can\u2019t assume.", "We have a whole thread talking abt that.", "Well, that\u2019s a crappy explanation.\n\nThe sheriff star is just as recognizable, if not more recognizable than an actual police uniform. The sheriff star is arguably the most well-known symbol of law enforcement.  \n\nEither way; he explained his undershirt to the hospital staff and they did not think it would have done any good, so why do you?", "It\u2019s not pathetic; it\u2019s the truth. maybe it never occurred to him to turn the uniform inside out. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to. The hospital could\u2019ve provided a gown.

I don't get it.", "As evidenced by the sheer amount of LEO's weighing in, turning the shirt inside out was also an option and, as it seems, super common within the workforce.", "> You haven\u2019t made a single valid point why the cop should have changed clothes. \n\nThe hospital told him that it was necessary, they requested it, they basically demanded it. And they are the professionals, they had the care of the patients so their opinions and their rules must be respected and obeyed. He doesn't get to dispute that and neither do you or I. Why is that insufficient reason for you?"]}
