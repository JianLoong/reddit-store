She went behind your back and against your wishes and as a result your son got hurt.

An adult teaching a child to hide their time together from other adults is a dangerous slippery slope. \n\nThe deception here is so egregious to me that it\u2019s unforgivable.", "NTA. She can say she \u201cdidn\u2019t mean for it to happen\u201d, but her hiding it just proves that she knew the potential dangers. It\u2019s NEVER ok to ask a child to keep a secret from their parents or undermine their authority.", "NTA Coming from a family where I had 2 amazing step parents and now I am one. I understand what she was doing but she should never go against the wishs of the birth parents of a child. \n\nIts your right to let your kid do and not do stuff but its a skateboard and a skate park under supervision. Yes he got hurt but thats part of growing up. I hope its just negativity toward skateboarding for some reason and  both of you don't keep your son \"wrapped in bubble wrap\" b/c when he gets out in the world real life will hit him hard.", "NTA for the question around you being furious with your ex for going behind our back, forcing your son to lie to you and teaching him that rules don\u2019t matter.\n\nHowever I think that your no skateboards are dangerous so no skateboards policy was poorly thought out.  You should be encouraging your kids passions and determining a way for the activities to be done safely.\n\nIf you had gotten him the skate board you would have been in control of safety gear being worn while he was learning.  You would have been in control of the level of difficulty and risk he was taking as he gained experience.  He still might have gotten hurt doing it but kids sports whether it be soccer, basketball, football, baseball, or skateboarding all carry risks of injury but in general are a net benefit to development.", "NTA.\n\nYou're girlfriend overstepped a huge boundary. She shouldn't be encouraging your child to keep secrets from his parents, regardless of whether or not her intentions were pure. In fact I think what she did was very selfish. The injuries you can get from skateboarding really aren't a joke. I mean back when I was first skating I fucked up my elbow really badly and almost knocked my front teeth out, even with the safety gear.\n\nI understand that kids sometimes have to fail to learn, but this is going way too far in my opinion. \n\nFor future reference, if he's going to start skating he should be taught by or atleast supervised by a professional or someone experienced at least.", "NTA - whether you agree with a decision or not, you do not overstep your boundaries.  If the 2 parents have decided on something for their child, she just needed to keep away. She had no business overriding what you and your ex considered appropriate for your kid. I have seen many children younger than 9 skateboarding bit that is up.to the parents. And now she knows why you guys were against your kid skateboarding.  Hope your son recovers soon.", "NTA. I'd be furious if I were the mother. Also, she's been teaching your son to hide something for three months, they might even have other 'secrets'. She would not have told you about it if the injury or something worse did not happened. She may have simply intended to improve her relationship with your kid, but what she did was unacceptable, and she deserved being called that. Something worse could have happened.", "NTA. She endangered your son. She could've potentially endangered your custody agreement if your ex wanted (husband leaving child with someone she doesn't know who let child injure themselves). It was not your girlfriend's place to make this decision, and teaching a kid to keep a secret from their parents sets a very dangerous precedent should they meet a less savoury adult.\n\nHowever.. a skateboard is a skateboard. Discouraging a kid from sports, a relatively cheap one at that, doesn't sit right with me. Buy him some knee pads, wrist guards, elbow pads, a helmet, etc. Kids getting occasional injuries are normal.", "Nta, I probably would've called her worse, for me this would be the end of the relationship, I wouldn't be able to trust her around my kid again especially if she's asking my kid to keep things from me or their other parent and going behind my back to do things regarding my child.", "NTA \n\nshe really crossed the line", "NTA. Typically name calling is uncool, but going behind your back / against your wishes is a pretty shitty thing to do.", "NTA\u2026she went behind your back to buy your son a skateboard even though she knew that both you and his mom were against this.  She has then taught your child to lie to his parents about this.  If I were this kids mom I would be livid.  Are there any other secrets that you don\u2019t know. Girlfriend totally betrayed your trust.  Who is she to decide that what his parents say is meaningless because she wants to do something nice?", "NTA I can\u2019t believe she did this. That\u2019s not okay and she broke everyone\u2019s trust. I would say do counseling or breakup. It\u2019s scary that she thought this was okay.", "NTA \n\nShe bought your 9 year old something she knew that you and his mother didn't want him to have and told him to lie to both of you about it. You said nothing untrue, and I would reconsider the relationship. An SO who encourages your still fairly young child to lie to you while undermining you is not a good partner.", "NTA. You and the mother made a decision, but in an attempt make herself look better and to look cool your girlfriend decided the decision of the child's parents didn't matter, because she wanted to look cool. \n\nShe's been lying to your for months and undermined your parenting, and jeopardised your coparenting relationship. She absolutely should not be allowed around your child.", "NTA. She isn't your son's parent. This is not a parenting decision she had a right to overrule, nor is it a secret she had any right to keep from you. Further, her teaching your son to keep secrets from his parents is so far from okay that I'm not sure how I would trust her again.\n\nHeck, you mention her buying him a skateboard but I'm not seeing mention of any safety gear - did she at least buy him a helmet, and knee and elbow pads to make it as safe as possible?!", "NTA She undermined your authority as well as your child's mother's authority with the child. She also disrespected both parents and she conspired with your son to deceive you. She lied to you and encouraged your son to do the same. Her actions say that she does not respect the decisions you and the child's mother make about your son, that somehow, she knows better than both parents what is best for this child.\n\nI don't know how you can get past this. This isn't really about a dislocated shoulder or a skateboard. It is about respecting boundaries and allowing the parents to make decisions affecting their child. It sounds as if you were coparenting fine and you and your Ex agree on issues regarding your son. Now you have a GF who is telling your son it is ok to lie and deceive his parents and that parental authority is meaningless. This problem is much larger than her being an idiot.", "NTA\n\nYou and your ex are in charge of setting the appropriate boundaries for your son.\n\nYour girlfriend should never try to convince your child to lie to you.\n\nHe ended up in the hospital.\n\nDo you think she\u2019s a trustworthy person to be with? \n\nI wouldn\u2019t.", "NTA \n\nShe has no right to override decisions made by you and your son's mother. \n\nShe overstepped and also made your son keep secrets from you. You have every right to be pissed.", "She basically told him to lie to his parents. That\u2019s not okay whatsoever. What she did was pretty idiotic so yeah, NTA. Plus she makes you look bad in front of your ex. She\u2019s probably wondering what other lies your gf asks your son to keep. Good luck getting past this.", "NTA for coming down on your gf for buying your son a skateboard behind your back.  Calling her an idiot was not the kindest choice of words, but to be fair, her actions were inconsiderate & idiotic.  With that said, despite this recent injury, I'd encourage you to reconsider your stance on not allowing your son to try skateboarding, assuming he still wants to do so.  \n\nYour child has expressed a sincere interest in stakeboarding, & if he retains that interest after this incident, you should do what you can to help foster it & allow him to learn in a safe way.  I am admittedly no expert on skateboarding, but perhaps there are beginner lessons he could take with someone experienced?  Or maybe there is better safety gear he needs to protect him?  If this experience hasn't shook his interest skateboarding, I'd be concerned he will continue to skateboard after he heals & will simply hide it from you (& your gf too).", "NTA. I would break up with her. The sheer nerve of this woman.", "NTA. Ditch the gf.  She is basically teaching your son to lie to you and your ex.  The fact that she sees nothing wrong with her behavior is troubling to say the least.  I have a genetic syndrome which makes it easy for me to dislocate things at the drop of a hat.  I've dislocated my left shoulder 14 times.  Once the capsule around the joint is compromised, it gets easier and easier to dislocate that joint again.\n\nI'm not saying your son is totally innocent here.  He may have kept working on her until she caved.  Hey, he's a kid and that's what they do...keep asking until an adult says \"yes\" instead of \"no.\"  That being said, she needed to be the adult who kept saying \"No.\"  If she wasn't comfortable with that, she should have done what my grandmother did.\n\nGram A was known for being a stickler for the rules.  No use asking her for one.  Gram B was known for never saying \"No\" to her grandchildren (mind you, she had no trouble saying \"No\" to her three sons and their wives.  She loved them but had more fun spoiling us.).  I figured I'd ask her and get the skateboard of my dreams. Gram B (a former nurse) smiled sweetly and said \"You know, I don't know much about skateboards or where you'd be riding it.  I think your parents would be able to make a better decision about what you need.\"  See what she did there?  She never said \"No.\"  She deferred that dirty job to my parents.  Well played, Gram B, well played indeed.  Your gf should have done that.\n\nGood job of coparenting with your ex, though.  I'm sorry she gave you an earful, but it was probably due to stress in the moment.  When the dust has settled and the gf is gone (because she needs to be or you will have problems with ex sooner or later), apologize again (I'm sure you already did that day) and make it clear you were horrified to discover what had been going on.  Hopefully, things will eventually smooth out between you.", "A lot to unpack here. Not TA for being angry at being lied to. That is understandable. Your GF was straight up wrong there. But the question is if you are TA for calling her names. For that YTA (though I get it, uncalled for).\n\nI would also say denying a normal/healthy child of 9 a skateboard seems much. Kids will get injured in activities, that goes with the territory. As long as they wear safety gear and are reasonably smart (as much as a 9 YO boy can be) about how they do it then it seems a reasonable hobby. But that also wasn't the question. And your GF had no business doing that behind your back.\n\nA dislocated shoulder isn't the end of the world, I'd think twice taking this from your son. But a serious talk about communication, honesty, and boundaries regarding decisions your and your ex make are in order. But keep calm and be adult about it, don't call names.", "NTA. Undermining your parenting, encouraging your son to keep secrets from you. I'd rethink this relationship if I were you", "Nta. She override your parenting. Do things against your wishes. Tell your son to lie to his parents to get his way. She taught him to lie and hide from his parents if he wants to do something against their wishes. Op need to address the lying to the son  on why is it bad and tell him why you don\u2019t want him to do it again.", "NTA. A big part of parenting is teaching your young children not to keep any secrets from their parents. A parent's partner creating \"their secrets\" is not something I feel comfortable with. You don't want trusted adults modeling that kind of secret-keeping.\n\nI'm not accusing your girlfriend of anything sinister, it's just the principle of things. She overstepped majorly, and her overstep resulted in your son getting injured.", "I\u2019m assuming you already broke up with her, right? Because I can\u2019t imagine staying with someone who taught my child to lie to and keep secrets from me. \n\nShe is not a good partner in any sense of the word.", "She's lucky his mom didn't put her in the hospital.\n\nNTA.", "As a parent, I teach my kid that we don't keep secrets. So to read that your girlfriend actively encouraged your kid to keep secrets from his parents was alarming. Definitely red flag.\n\nAlso, the fact that she refuses to be held accountable for something this blatant is another red flag among others. Kids need to learn to own up to mistakes, make amends, try to do better in the future etc. She is not a good example of this.\n\nNTA for sure.", "Nta and you really shouldn't be in a relationship with someone who asks your minor child to keep secrets, that's all sorts of wrong.", "NTA she obviously betrayed the bio parents wishes. Not defending her at all but come on, you can\u2019t wrap him in cotton wool forever. Kids need to be kids and part of that is getting hurt sometimes and learning from it. Helmets, knee pads, elbow pads and he\u2019s good to go again.", "NTA. I think the kid should be able to skateboard, but that doesnt excuse anything your gf did", "NTA.  How soon will she be your ex gf.  She went behind your and your ex\u2019s backs AND taught your son to LIE to you.  How long before she takes him drinking or allows him to smoke pot or get a tattoo as a minor?", "NTA\n\nWow. In your ex's shoes I would be so angry right now I would be seriously contemplating going to court to make sure your GF was never again allowed access to your child without you physically present during your custody week.\n\nWhat are you doing to make sure your child is safe around this woman? If you're still considering continuing being in a relationship with her, I hope you are restricting her access to your child so that she is no longer around them when you aren't around. I don't care how \"cool\" your kid thinks she is. When you and your ex make a decision, THAT is the decision, especially when it comes to health and safety. She doesn't get to overrule you and your ex on parenting EVER just to play the \"cool\" new girlfriend.\n\nThe fact that this whole horrible accident happened where your son has a dislocated shoulder and could have been even more seriously injured, and her response isn't to beg your forgiveness and that of your ex, but to call you a dick and say she was just trying to do something nice... WOW. \n\nI'm just appalled at this. Seriously. Don't be surprised when your ex takes you to court.", "NTA - you set your boundaries and your girlfriend didn't respect them and went behind your back. Is normal that you are upset, especially since your kid got injured.\n\nBuuuut, I think you are overprotecting your kid, he can get injured by a lot of things but that alone shouldn't be a reason to stop him to try new things", "NTA\nShe is an IDIOT!", "ESH - for crying out loud, it's a skateboard. Your kid should be able to have a skateboard, like every other normal kid out there. Being overprotective this way never served anyone well. Sometimes injuries come with it, yeah, but obviously that never stopped Tony Hawk. You can't wrap him up in bubble wrap his whole life.\n\nYes, your GF should not have gone behind your back and bought him one. She also was wayyyyy wrong to asking your son to lie to you about it. That's a HUGE no-no. Besides all that, you should never call names like that, how childish.", "NTA for being upset at your GF but YTA for being a shitty dad and saying no skatepark ever. Your son isn\u2019t going to like you much. Also a 9 year old isn\u2019t too young. Your child is going to get hurt in life stop trying bubble wrap him. Maybe actually teach him about safety and not being afraid in life. Is your child even allowed to ride a bike or is that unsafe too? Can he play sports or he might twist an ankle so that\u2019s a no go\u2026.", "ESH she shouldn\u2019t have hid it or taught your kid to lie about it/hide things from you but also what is the big deal about skateboarding? She was trying to bond with your son by allowing him to do what most boys do. She was doing at a safe designates location and not just out in the street. He had a bad spill it happens and she immediately went to get him medical care. It sounds like he was wearing a helmet and pads since you don\u2019t say other wise. \n\nI think you blew up too much and at the wrong part of it \u2026it\u2019s not the skateboard it\u2019s the deception.", "NTA she didn\u2019t just \u2018overstep\u2019. She took a run up and Leapt over the line like she was training for the Olympics.", "YTA\n\nYour son has an interest and because you deem it unsafe you don't let him try. Tho if he started early he would have better skills. And it is important to him because it is all he talks about. He doesn't TRUST you or your ex enough but does trust your GF. And she seems to love him and helps with his interest. While it does suck she went behind your back, for 3 months your son has been able to do what he loves with her help. Not yours or your ex. Now you do have the right to be upset. But look in the mirror and ask yourself how your son trusts someone besides you or his mother. When you get to that painful answer then you can move on.\n\nYou can be upset they hid it. You can be upset he is hurt. But accidents happen. You should be happy she knows how important it is to him to even risk something like this. \n\nAs a parent it is so damn hard to let your kids fall. But if you never let them try then you will deal with them forever. Let them grow even if it is painful. Because it's important for them. If you freak on her and him it will maybe cause big issues with her but for him it may be lost trust and that only gets worse over time.\n\n\nEdit - Some may say your current GF overstepped. Your son is 9 and you have been with your current GF 4 years. Almost half your sons life. If you don't trust her to parent your kid, you have way bigger issues. You can't date her for years and expect her to not have any input with the kid. And if you DO think that it is none of her business after 4 years, then don't have her watch your kid, and that makes you an even bigger AH. After a few years, she deserves to have input also. Or she needs to find a better arrangement. Everyone wants to point to parents rights but just because she isn't the parent doesn't mean she doesn't care for the kid. And helping 4 years to raise this kid ....you don't think that gives her the right to give input?", "ESH\n\nI get why you and the child\u2019s mother said no to a skateboard but you can\u2019t wrap the child in cotton.  A skateboard with appropriate safety gear and lessons would have been a better choice.  By flat denying it, you basically insured he would find a way on his own.\n\nThe GF sucks because she went behind your back.", "ESH, her more than you. She shouldn't have gone behind your back and encouraged your child to lie to you. You shouldn't speak to people the way you did, even if you are angry. She clearly wasn't intending for him to get injured and 9 years old is right in line with when children can be expected to learn how to skateboard as safely as possible.", "Ok. I strongly suspect ESH.\n\nI wanted to say NTA. You set a boundary and your girlfriend repeatedly betrayed you, and undermined your authority with your son, and your son was injured as a direct result.\n\nThe part that boils my piss the most, is that she made him promise not to tell you. In my family, we don't have secrets. It's a body safety rule. If someone says \"don't tell anyone I touched you there, it's our little secret\" hopefully my kids would still tell me. We have \"surprises\" for short term secrets, so they don't tell people about presents or stuff like that. Obviously I know as they get older they will keep secrets from me, but I do NOT appreciate it when adults ask them to keep secrets (even small ones).\n\nYou might be TA if you have created an atmosphere in your home whereby your girlfriend and son are walking on egg shells and feel they need to keep things from you because your reactions are disproportionate, aggressive and/or abusive. You maybe don't do that, but this would be a good time to check in and self reflect. A 9yo having a skateboard is an age appropriate risk. It's good for kids to test their capabilities and get a few scrapes, it's how they learn and grow.", "ESH absolutely not okay for your girlfriend to undermine you as a parent. Doesn't matter if she's your long girlfriend, wife, mother of your child or not, undermining you was 100% in the wrong. Parenting is a team effort. You are completely justified in how you're feeling. Having said that, I'm not okay with name calling, which is unproductive and can be deeply hurtful to people.", "ESH - she shouldn\u2019t have gone behind your back and had a secret with the kid but you were shutting him out from something that he was very interested in. If the two of you were on the same page you could have been involved and the son could\u2019ve learned how to skate in a more safe environment", "ESH- your kid is just that, a kid. He\u2019s gonna fall, he\u2019s gonna get hurt. Be it from a skateboard or through some other medium. Your GF probably had borderline good intentions, maybe she felt like this was her way to get your son to look at her a certain way. Not justifying just trying to see a \u201clegitimate\u201d motive. She\u2019s definitely off base with telling your child to essential deceive you all. But you are a 30 year old man. You can\u2019t talk to people like that. As a man you have to have that mental fortitude and ability to keep calm to avoid these outcomes. I get it your kid was hurt, but you know in your heart of hearts she didn\u2019t do it for a malicious reason. I saw some other comments saying stuff like \u201c what if the kid got hit by a car?\u201d We can play hypothetical scenarios all day. But that\u2019s not what happened, if that exact scenario happened there would be alternate variables that would be in play. If that situation did happen, the implication would be that she allowed a child near an active road to play around on the skateboard. Different league of negligence long and far. She was in a designated area watching over him. Again, she\u2019s still shitty, but it came from a decent place at the very least.", "NTA but 9 is probably the ideal time for him to start learning how to skateboard", "ESH softly You can\u2019t protect your child from everything. There\u2019s danger in every activity. Eventually he\u2019s going to get hurt. Your girlfriend was wrong & major AH in keeping it from you. You should find out if she\u2019s hiding more secrets from you. You should not have called her an idiot, but I understand the anger you were feeling. Betrayal is a hard pill to swallow. Soft Your Ex is wrong trying to protect him from everything.", "ESH.  Worst is your girlfriend who completely ignored your parental decisions, made your coparenting complicated and is complicit in teaching your son to go behind your back.  You're TA for not explaining that to her in adult terms, especially when she is already paying the price of seeing your son in the hospital.", "NTA. But really, with the \u201che could get injured?\u201d He could get injured walking from his classroom to the lunchroom but are you forbidding that? Get him the right equipment and helmet and pads and let the poor kid be a kid.", "ESH - she is TA for doing all this behind your back. Parenting at cross purposes is a recipe for disaster, as happened here. I wouldn\u2019t have called her an idiot but it was, in fact, an idiotic thing to have done all this behind your back. At worst, it creates a culture in which your kid will think it\u2019s okay to keep secrets from you and someone with far worse intentions can take advantage of that in ways I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to specify.  \n\nYou\u2019re TA for being overprotective to the point that you\u2019re forbidding your son from pursuing an interest. He\u2019s not too young - he\u2019s in fact the perfect age to start skateboarding because he\u2019s both got a lower center of gravity and kids are just less brittle (assuming there isn\u2019t some compounding condition going on here). A dislocated shoulder may hurt but like, that\u2019s being a kid. You can afford to get hurt. When he\u2019s 25 and has to work a job and missing a week of work will legitimately make him miss bills, he certainly won\u2019t be able to pursue this interest then. \n\nLet your kid skate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I asked my girlfriend why the fuck did she think that would be okay and she simply said she just wanted to make my son happy and she argued that she never let him skate alone, she was always with him. Apparently she would take him to the skatepark whenever I was out of the house (which wasn\u2019t often but I don\u2019t want him at the skatepark ever) I called her a \u201cfucking idiot\u201d and that it\u2019s her fault that my son got injured.
