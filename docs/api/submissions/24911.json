About a year ago the guy she was dating for about a month or two had passed away in an accident and she had told me it really hit her hard. I feel bad for her. However, since we have been dating, i\u2019ve noticed she wears this t-shirt with his face on it quite often, i\u2019d say around 2-3 times a week. At first i brushed it off but i\u2019m ngl it\u2019s gotten to me over the past few weeks. whenever we go out for drinks she always takes a shot for him, talks about him constantly and has even made tiktoks about him while we have been together. I\u2019m not saying she can\u2019t do any of this stuff, it just makes me feel like i\u2019m just a replacement. \n\nYesterday I asked her if she could stop wearing his shirt around me as it makes me feel uncomfortable and like i said, just a replacement. She proceeded to get very angry with me and told me i was being insensitive and hasn\u2019t talked to me since. I feel bad and i feel i may have triggered her emotions around it. I\u2019ve sent her paragraphs of me apologizing but she hasn\u2019t answered yet.

It sounds like she's not ready for another relationship.", "NTA. It's not unreasonable to feel uncomfortable by your girlfriend frequently wearing t-shirts of her deceased ex's face. However, it mainly sounds like she isn't done grieving and shouldn't be in a new relationship. You've only been dating for two months, you are not  required to be her rock, or guide her through the grieving process of her ex. If it makes you uncomfortable, then that's just a personal boundary. There's nothing wrong with her wearing the t-shirt, or taking shots, but that may be a sign that she isn't ready for a relationship. Overall, if you feel uncomfortable or like you're being made into a replacement, reevaluate the relationship.", "NTA. She isn't ready to date again.  She needs to get over him first.  But, I would be concerned about her being a bit obsessive when she only dated him for such a short time.  That's the kind of behavior I would expect from a spouse or long-term significant other.   \n\nFind a new person to date.  I think you dodged a bullet.", "Nta, I would just tell her that you think she isn't ready fora new relationship and it's okay, she just needs some more time.", "NTA. She\u2019s still grieving. You are a distraction to help with her pain (sorry). Move on.", "As long as you had a sensitive conversation with her, then no I don't think you're the asshole because she has clearly displayed that she is not over the idea of what her future would have been like with him.", "NTA\n\nShe's obviously still dealing with grief and not ready to be in a new relationship yet. The way she treats you is insensitive and unfair to you. You're right to feel like you're just being used as an emotional support replacement and not actually being treated as a new partner. Don't try to compete with the dead you can't ever win. Just move on and chalk this relationship between you two up to bad timing.", "NTA", "NTA.\nShe has not moved or made any efforts to show that she's moving on. I mean if you talk about them rarely it's okay but wearing a t-shirt of their face? Taking a shot for him? And constantly talking about him? It seems like you are just a distraction for her now.", "NTA", "NTA but it's borderline. She's definitely still grieving and not ready to move on so it may be best if you move on instead. Maybe in time, when she's healed some, you two might try again but some time apart wouldn't hurt as things stand.", "NTA - But also slightly TA, she is clearly still grieving and has not moved on, you need more understanding for her, your feelings aren't invalid though but you should give her more time. As for the girl's side, I don't think she's ready for you and a relationship, not until she has fully moved on from her ex.", "This is a hard one. I'd go with a gentle YTA. You need to be more understanding; a year isn't a long time after losing someone, even someone you weren't with for that long a time. Especially when it's your first time dealing with death. The idea someone is there one day and not there the next is an overwhelming concept. And the idea of being jealous of a deceased person is a little petty.", "At first I was like \"oh boy, here we go, more people being jealous of someone who's dead\" but then I read it\n\nEhh... So \nYTA - but only a tiny~ bit? Requesting someone stop wearing something of significance to them while they're still grieving is kinda shitty ... doesn't matter the significance of who they were in their life, grief is grief. \n\nI don't genuinely think you should be dating. If she talks about him and still is in grieving, you're likely just the rebound/comfort person... Which is shitty to say, because she probably is genuinely lonely and does actually have feelings for you- but until she can process her grief and heal a bit, she really should not be dating.", "YTA.  Grief doesn't have a time limit.  She's still processing.  She needs your support, not your condescension.  And you need to work on your insecurities; you are not a replacement, you are her boyfriend.  Step up.", "Her grief is part of who she is now, your trying to minimize her feelings because you feel uncomfortable. Would you drop grief for someone that impacted your life because your partner felt insecure over someone who's dead.YTA", "Ehhhh I have to go with ESH. You suck because yes, you are being a bit insensitive. My dude you are jealous of a dead guy, that's not a good look. She sucks because it's clearly way too soon for her to be dating again and you are obviously collateral damage in this. \n\nTo put it simply, both of you are too young to be expected to know how to deal with this. That's okay. This is huge, and it's crazy to expect people who are barely old enough to drink to know how to navigate it. Unfortunately she will likely end up resenting you, because that's just where her grief is. I lost my fiance when I was very young, and for years I hated everyone, because no one knew what to do or say to me, so they always said the wrong things. Eventually she'll probably be in a place where she's stable enough to understand that it's unrealistic to expect a bunch of college aged kids to understand what she's going through.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She clearly isn\u2019t over this guy yet, so it\u2019s time for you to move on.", "Oof competing with an idealized man. (By this I mean they were in the honeymoon phase where everything is new and wonderful. And he will never do her wrong due to his death). That's rough. Even if she were ready it would be rough. Cut your losses. You deserve better than   to be her stand in.", ">I would be concerned about her being a bit obsessive when she only dated him for such a short time\n\nExactly what I was thinking - unless they were friends for a long time before they dated, this is a little odd. \n\n>She isn't ready to date again.\n\n>Find a new person to date. I think you dodged a bullet.\n\nThis. Time to move on.", "Grief works in its own ways. A couple months may be small, but people will meet and get married in less time than that. We dont know the situation.", "Dude, taking shots for him, making ticktocks, where king a shirt with his face on it? I believe it\u2019s normal for someone to feel not as important. It\u2019s not pettiness, it\u2019s how he feels, and it\u2019s valid", "It. It has the dead guys face on it.", "She wears a shirt with her exes face on it. It's not like keeping pics on your phone or pictures in your room. You're going out in public with a new bf with your old bfs face on your shirt. Sure, everyone greaves differently, but I don't know anyone who would be happy with that scenario. And just asking not to wear it when he is around isn't asking a lot. He isn't asking her to forget about him or their relationship or throw the shirt away. Just don't wear it when he is around. It's not a terrible compromise.  If she isn't at the point to have a calm discussion about it, she probably shouldn't be dating again yet.", "I understand grief, but it sounds like she jumped into another relationship too fast. It doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole or insecure to not want to mourn over a guy who he\u2019s never met.", "A T shirt with his face on it strikes me as unusually performative, as does making tik toks about him in the presence of a new partner. It doesn't strike me as acts of symbolic significance that are normally associated with grief, more acts of maximal public visibility.", "That's why I said gentle YTA. His feelings are valid and if the other person was alive it would be a different answer. I think people are allowed to grieve in their own ways. And 1 year is not enough time to have moved past it", "I wore my late fiances ashes in a necklace for six years. I literally didn't take the necklace off for six years. I even wore it in the shower.", "I wore a necklace with my late fiances ashes in it, and still wore my engagement ring for six years. I still wore them for eight months into my current relationship, and my boyfriend was completely supportive. \n\nShe definitely shouldn't be dating again so soon after, but he also could be more gentle about it. However, they are both kids practically, they're too young to know how to handle this and that's okay.", "How does one properly mourn? what's the protocol and time frame?", "Yeah that\u2019s normal. But a shirt with his face on it? That\u2019s going a bit far", "A necklace of ashes has symbolic significance, as does a ring. A t-shirt with someone's face on it, at least to me, communicates something different. I'd wager most people don't walk around with dead family members' face on their clothes, unless they died from some public injustice. It comes across as performative.", "Depends on the person. Sure, everyone is different. It seems unusual to me that someone grieving would invite other (strangers) into their grief. A ring and a necklace aren't the same as posting videos on tik tok.", "I dont think it's any weirder than me literally wearing someone's ashes of their body for six years. \n\n\nAs to say, if it brings her comfort, it's not weird.", "How does one grieve properly then? Can you answer that at least? I get it's unusual, so what's the usual way to show greif? How do you suggest she heal from losing someone?", "Is it weird to have? No, people grieve in different ways. What\u2019s weird is that she\u2019s wearing it around her new boyfriend. It\u2019s just a generally uncomfortable situation", "I think we just have to agree to disagree on that one. I will say that they are both very young, too young to know how to navigate this kind of trauma. She definitely shouldn't be dating yet, and he could be a bit more sensitive about it.", "Oh yeah she\u2019s definitely not ready to date", "INFO: how long had she known him *before* they started dating?", "NTA but leaning towards YTA  \n\n\nShes still grieving, let her think of him, you never know their story, just let her slowly move on", "Again, I don't think there is a \"right way\" in particular, I think there are right motivations. My experience with people's grief is it tends to be quite personal, private and sensitive. People often do things that have pretty specific significance that might only be understood by them and others that know them. Often it's quite private.\n\nI might be wrong about my interpretation of her motivations. Maybe she gets a lot of emotional support from people on tik tok and has a different sense of personal boundaries than I do. Maybe they bonded over shots when he was alive. Maybe there is more sentimental value to the t-shirt than I see, and it was something they used to enjoy doing when they were together. But my impression is that these acts are more about showing grief to others than dealing with grief."]}
