{"id": 13605, "submission_id": "1273hbl", "title": "WIBTA for not going to my daughter's sister's wedding?", "selftext": "My daughter's mother has another daughter, my daughter's half sister. For simplicity's sake I will call her Barbara. I will call my daughter Lily. I will refer to their mom as Gloria.\n\nNow I recently received and invitation to Barbara's wedding. I found this sort of odd as I have not had any contact with her in years. I'm also not a fan of weddings. I basically only attend them if they are for a close friend or family member. So I sent back the electronic rsvp declining the invite.\n\nA few days later I get a message from my Gloria saying that Barbara was crushed that I declined the invite. Gloria said that Barbara was trying to extend an olive branch and bury the hatchet. Barbara had hoped that I would be there to walk her down the aisle like any dad is supposed to.\n\nAfter reading this message I was immediately confused because I didn't know what the fuck she is talking about. What does she mean bury the hatchet? More importantly what does she mean by referring to me as her dad. Just to be clear I have never considered Barbara to be my child. I have never taken a parental role in her life. Sure, I was around a lot while she was growing up because I wanted to be as involved in my daughter's life as possible and sometimes I included Barbara when taking Lily out just to be nice. That really was the extent of it. I'm not sure how that translates to me being her dad. Especially since I would only have my Lily overnight half the week and only take Lily on vacations and to visit my family. I only took an active role in parenting Lily.\n\nI didn't know how to respond to Gloria, so I talked to Lily about it to try and get some insight. Lily explained how years ago Barbara made a comment about her being the golden child in front of me. It was supposed to be some sort of dig at me favoring Lily. This must have flew over my head as I don't remember it and frankly why would I think it had anything to do with me. But Lily said Barbara thought I was really upset at her because of what she said and that's why I stopped coming around. Reality is that was around the time that Lily went to college. So without Lily being there I really had no reason to go over to Gloria's anymore. Lily said she hadn't said anything about it to me because the whole situation weirded her out and she didn't want to become more involved.\n\nSo I finally replied back to Gloria and told her that this was all a big misunderstanding. Gloria said even if it was (she doesn't think it was she still thinks I just abandoned Barbara after having been around her whole life) I should try to understand how it has caused Barbara so much pain over the years, how hard it was for her to forgive me, and how it would really be great if I could just show up so she doesn't continue to feel unwanted and can finally get closure.\n\nBut given all this information I feel far less inclined to go to the wedding than I did before. Like Lily I think the whole thing is weird and I'd rather not become more involved either.", "created_utc": 1680220099, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1273hbl/wibta_for_not_going_to_my_daughters_sisters/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why would she allow Barbara to think you\u2019re her father? It seems pretty cut and dry that you didn\u2019t have a parental role.", "Gloria has no problem with Barbara's perception of OP as her dad. Gloria talks of Barbara seeing OP as being \"around for her whole life\" when Barbara's bio dad has been AWOL. Barbara buys into the \"father of my sister must be my father too\" enough to compare treatment as if Lily is OP's favored child instead of being his \\_only\\_ child. \n\nThis seems to be quite a fantasy web they've woven. It's out there enough that Lily was weirded out by it and OP missed the story altogether.\n\nNTA, OP. \n\n It's a sad story and I hope that Barbara gets some help to work through what's real and what's not. This is a child who was so desperate to have two parents that she invented one. Gloria is likely to be of little help in returning Barbara to a reality based perspective. Barbara seems to have been used by Gloria to invent a connection to her ex beyond the child they produced together.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re not required to be there for someone when they aren\u2019t truly related to you. It is not like you really \u201cabandoned her\u201d because you were never really there for her in the first place.", "YWNBTA It sounds as if she is projecting a father role onto you. From what you posted you were never a father figure; you weren't even a stepfather. Somehow your being kind to your daughter's half-sister on occasion has been misconstrued.\n\nI would not continue this misconception as it doesn't seem healthy for Barbara to believe that she is a daughter to you when she isn't. I don't see how anyone would benefit from continuing with this false narrative.  I feel sorry for Barbara and I believe her mother must have played a part in this young woman's confusion.\n\nI think it would be worse if you allowed this to continue. Your daughter's sister may need counseling to work through her feelings. You need to maintain your boundaries and not give any false hope that you will be a father to her. Don't allow her to believe you will be a grandfather to any children she may have. Sometimes a clean break is the kindest way to do this.\n\nINFO: Where is Barbara's father?", "NTA. Stay as far away from that wedding as possible. Don't let Barbara or Gloria pull you into whatever weird circus they have going on. You are not her father, based on your post and comments you never acted like her father, and the only person you should be walking down the ailse should be your actual daughter. Gloria either encouraged or did nothing to stop her daughter from developing the delusion that you spending time with your daughter and occassionally inviting her along was you being her father. The fact that Lily was the only one to spend the night at your place and the only one to call you dad should have been a huge red flag to Barbara. Did you attend her l graduation? Pay for her schooling? These are all things a parent does.", "YWNBTA.\n\nI feel really bad for Barbara, though. It's likely she had latched onto the positive father role she found in you, but had misunderstood/ignored the reality of the situation. \n\nI guess the ex-wife is the A H though. This was something she should have communicated about and found the solution instead of letting her daughter hurt and stew in resentment, which probably spilled onto Lily at times too. Communication would have avoided this current situation.  \n\nIf you don't feel comfortable doing it, don't do it. I don't think I would want someone to begrudgingly walk me down the aisle or be at my wedding.", "INFO: could Gloria have implied in any way to Barbara you may be her father?", "NTA. But Barbara probably grew up watching her sister having an active involved father and didn\u2019t comprehend why shes not part of it. Its completely not your fault but Gloria should have handled it much better since its her kid and her household so theres no way she didn\u2019t see this happening. Feel very sorry for Barbara and hope shes well but totally NTA for not going to the wedding. It wasn\u2019t even an invitation as a guest, she wanted you to take her down the aisle.

It\u2019s clear that Gloria has spent years selling you as a father figure to Barbara when you very clearly Never took that role or even really a familial role in her life at all. \n\nBarbara\u2019s emotional state is completely on her mothers shoulders. Even if she didn\u2019t set you up as a father figure, whic I doubt she didn\u2019t, it was her duty as her parent to make sure she was emotionally healthy.", "INFO: did you and Barbara ever live in the same household, or did you only see her when you visited your ex?  Where is her dad?", "INFO: Are you Barbara's ex step-father or are you her just half-sister's dad?", "NTA\n\nBarbara\u2019s not an AH either.

Lily clearly does so I assume she does, but she and Gloria are both acting like you are her dad so I just had to ask.\n\nCould you discuss this directly with Barbara?

If she wanted somone to walk her down the aisle She could have ask you personally, instead hoping you turn then ask you.", "NTA that makes sense.\n\nGloria probably kept telling Barbara that you came to see BOTH of his daughters, that the visits were for both of them. When in reality you kinda had to include her to be nice. \n\nDont go to the wedding, your intuition is right.", "NAH. You're not required to go, but if Barbara latched onto you as a father figure, it's because *she has no other father*. That's why she would even consider asking you to walk her down the aisle. It's very sad. \n\nIt would be a nice gesture if you wanted to do it, but since you don't like going to weddings I would only do it if Lily asked you to.", "Reluctant NAH.  Because I get where you\u2019re coming from, but my heart aches for Barbara.", "[deleted]", "I think the fact that you never thought to speak directly to Barbara about this issue tells it all. You don't feel a relationship to her. Mind you, you didn't say if Barbara and you lived under the same roof, how many years, and starting at what age. She might be seeing you as a father figure wether you like it or not. A little chat with her to clear the non-incident and the expectations could be a good idea if you are sensitive to this human being that has been somewhat loosely in your life.\n\nBased on the infos provided : NAH, but the mother seems unhelpful.\n\nEdit : OP said in a comment he never lived under the same roof with even the mother of his own child.", "Sad NAH, except maybe Gloria for not coaching Barbara through her confused feelings that she's been coping with for years. My heart goes out to Barbara. \n\nCould an authentic and kind conversation help resolve her wish to have you stand in as a father at her wedding? Is there any way you could find some compassion for her in your heart and express your respect for her? Walking someone down the aisle is generally considered an honor; could you find it in yourself to thank her for offering this, while kindly declining on the basis that you are not prepared to stand in as a father figure for her?", "How old was Barbara when you came into her life and did  you live with her at any point in time?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're not Barbara's father, so you are not obligated to go. However, maybe to keep the peace for Lily's sake (assuming there could be or already is drama happening) perhaps you could send a small wedding gift to Barbara.

That is all projection in her part. Plus if she really felt that way, if she really felt you were some kind of dad to her , she could have asked you years ago why you stopped coming over to her house. And you would have clarified. Strange of her to build this fairy tale of a dad , and then dad being the bad guy who abandoned her and she doesn\u2019t even care enough to call.", "I didn't think you did. Maybe you should have a talk with Lily to see if there was anything else that went on while she was growing up that weirded her out at her mom's. I hate that her sister's delusions about you made her feel weird growing. Also I see some comments saying poor Barbara. Please don't let anyone guilt you into feeling sorry for Barbara. She is an adult now. Despite what lies or delusion her mom allowed her to have growing up. She is adult and reality should have kicked in that you are not her father. If she is a function adult living in this world she has either been exposed to or read about what a typical father daughter relationship consist of. There is no biological, legal or emotional connection between you two.", "OP just for clarification, which girl is the older one?", "Then totally NTA. You did not live with her or bring her up other than being a nice guy and including her. I am confused by the overreaction and I wonder if Gloria encouraged this?", "Then you were never her step-father, only her mom\u2019s ex.  NTA", "Yeah. No clue why you'd even be asked.  \nNTA. You're no relation to Barbara and I can't even imagine why you'd be a candidate for walking her down the aisle.

I hope you can talk with Barbara and respectfully explain.", "Well Barbara would have her own biological father. Whether and why he isn\u2019t in the picture is an unknown issue. Whether Barbara is an affair baby is another issue. \n\nThe fact that Gloria is pointing the finger at OP for not being a father to a child who isn\u2019t his speaks volumes.", "Barbara is looking for a dad to walk her down the aisle and is wanting OP to do it even though he didn't think he was a father figure to subside who isn't his daughter", "Yeah that sounds like a really tough conversation to have, especially knowing that Barbara has built you up in her head to be something you aren\u2019t (her dad). Rejecting people is hard, especially when they\u2019re innocent in the situation. \n\nThat tough convo should be up to Gloria since she\u2019s the one who failed to explain the dynamics for her kid\u2019s whole life. Gloria her to have that conversation with Barbara now. NTA but gloria is TA for sure. it might bring Barbara some closure if you talk to her AFTER Gloria and explain that you weren\u2019t mad at her or anything.", "So- knowing this: Barbara\u2019s perspective makes a lot of sense. She met you when she was too young to differentiate between a parent figure and her sister\u2019s parent. Especially if you were around and taking her places. For her- those were bonding experiences. She would have had NO concept that you were just being nice unless Gloria really helped her understand the nuances as she grew. Especially if she didn\u2019t have her own dad around. And it doesn\u2019t sound like Gloria did. \n\nAnd I can see where it would be confusing and hurtful to her if she saw you as family- a surrogate dad- with no idea that you didn\u2019t feel the same way about her. \n\nBlended families are tricky. Everyone needs to get along, figure out the peace and balance. But we forget that children see things differently than we do. That they bond to adults instinctively- especially in those formative years. If she had a dad vacancy in her heart for whatever reason- she would not have made a decision to stick you there- it would have come naturally. So- it\u2019s not your fault or hers. \n\nIf you have it in you, the kind thing to do would be to meet her for coffee and a chat- or talk to her some other way. And apologize for her hurt. Explain to her that it was never her fault that you left. That you had no idea she considered you a father figure. That you thought she understood your role in the family was only as Lily\u2019s dad. Will it break her heart to learn you didn\u2019t see her as a daughter? Totally. But the healing she will be able to gain with this clarity likely outweighs it. \n\nWhat I don\u2019t get is why Gloria doesn\u2019t see it your way. Did she encourage this idea of you being a surrogate parent or family member to Barbara? If so, she\u2019s an absolute AH. \n\nAs for the wedding- NTA.", "No, I said Lily is the younger one.", "Barbara", "No, we weren't.

Barbara has clearly been failed by her parents and she definitely has a lot of built up trauma where actual parental neglect facilitated imaginary parental alienation.\n\nYou don\u2019t have any obligation to Barbara, but you should at least recognize an opportunity to do something good. Talk to Lily and see how she feels about clearing the air with Barbara without Gloria\u2019s interference.\n\nGiven the events you\u2019ve described, it sounds like Barbara is genuine.
