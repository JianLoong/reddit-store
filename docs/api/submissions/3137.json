I want to say worse but not sure how far to push it. You mention your mother has always tried to be controlling of your lives but do you have any clues as to why she would want this horror show for a Son In Law? I would not blame your sister in the least for going NC on your mother.", "NTA\n\nMom staged a crisis to pull your sister away from her own child's birthday.\n\nThat's shit a 5yo grows out of.\n\nMaybe Mike and your mom should be the ones shacking up. /s", "NTA. Your mom and dad both are though. They need to stay out of your sister's love life. She chooses not to remarry that's her business. If she chooses not to date that she wants to make her kids a priority again her business. Marry a man she does not even like and raise his child while he is a strict father and disciplinary to her own that he will never ever see his own children again, no, her business. Maybe you going off on your mother will wake her up but doubtful.", "NTA. You told the truth.", "Was\u2026. Was your mother trying to surprise arrange marriage her? Either way, NTA. Your mother is delusional.", "This feels like some horror story arranged marriage shit. How in the world does your mom think she\u2019s going to set up an adult with someone they do not like. Super evil. \n\nNTA \n\nYou were speaking the truth. And your sister needed someone to stick up for her.", "NTA.\n\nYou spoke the absolute truth.", "NTA. Mike would bully her grandbabies but she wants what she wants. Well pass time for NC.", "NTA! Your sister made her wishes knows. Why your mother wants to marry your sister off to some older guy who just sounds gross, is beyond me. The guy sounds pathetic and abusive. I'm happy to hear how supportive and protective you are of your sister. Keep that up and stay away from this guy and your parents if you can help it. This whole thing is creepy and weird.", "ESH. Your mom is terrible for not respecting boundaries and pushing your sister at someone your sister has been clear she isn\u2019t interested in and clearly wouldn\u2019t be a good fit with her sons. But I think you could have been more diplomatic in your wording choice and had more of an impact. Instead of everyone being focused on your mom\u2019s behavior they are now focused on your words.\n\nI\u2019d sit her down and apologize for the wording, but be clear she is not being respectful of your sister, nor you by expecting you to help your mom in her ridiculous plans. Tell her not to involve you anymore.\n\nYour sister needs to establish better boundaries with her and possibly go LC if your mom can\u2019t respect those- but that\u2019s really between the two of them.", "NTA. \nHonestly, your mother is just broken. After multiple \"no\"s she should give up (obviously not happening) - I would suggest you & your sister go NC/LC at the very least. This is some fucked up bullshit.", "NTA, what is in this for your mother? It is super f'i g creepy like your mother is selling your sister to this mike for something! I would tell my sister to go no contact and to stay the hell away from mom all together.", "There's no justified asshole rating but that was some extreme provocation, so NTA. I suspect your mother is only getting support because she has spun the narrative... and if people understand what happened and still think her behavior is ok, you don't need those people anyway.\n\nSeriously, her behavior is warped. Continue being an awesome sibling.", "NTA\n\nShe keeps trying to det your sister up with someone she doesn't like. Then she has the audacity to say that since she's your mom she deserves respect.  She lacks respect for your sister and you therefore she gets no respect herself.", "Your sister needs to run away. He sounds horrible. \n\nYour moms motto is \u201cbetter to have a bad husband than no husband \u201c\n\nNta", "NTA, but is time for your sister, her kids, and you to go LC/NC with your parents. \n\nHere's a script:\n\nMom and Dad, we have told you repeatedly that Sister has absolutely no interest in Mike. She does not like him or enjoy being around him. He is literally mean to her kids. She will not ever marry him. Because you have refused to listen to the point where you faked an emergency to get us to leave setting up Sister's party for Nephew's Birthday to get us to come to your house so you could try to force her to attend a party for Mike. \n\nRespect is earned, not given, and is a two way street. You have refused to respect Sister's right to her own life. We will not be forced to be around Mike anymore. If he's more important to you, you have gained a son and lost two daughters and two grandsons. We hope you are pleased with your choice.", "NTA but name calling doesn\u2019t help your sister out. You can\u2019t fight this fight for her. Your sister needs to shut your mom & mike down ASAP. If mom & mike refuse to listen then she should go NC", "NTA. So this is why pizza mike was so angry.", "Who is Mike and why does he think he is marrying your sister? Did your your mother sell her off to Mike and now he believes he owns her? NTA for calling out your mother. What she is doing to your sister is violating, disrespectful, abusive and completely awful. What your mother is doing to your sister is malicious and unforgivable. I would say it\u2019s time to go LC with her.", "[NTA.WTF](https://NTA.WTF) is wrong with your mom? Where would she be getting support from- people she lied to about the situation? Probably.   Seriously, this is a relationship ending move here.  Your sister and you need to block both of them and go NC.  If your mom is so hot on Mike she can have him.", "NTA - Mom wants Mike but is too lazy to file for a divorce is the vibe I'm getting.\n\nWell done having your sister's back btw.", "NTA. is your mother disabled by any chance?", "NTA", "NTA\n\nthis is so bizarre. Why is your sister being talked about like she has no say? Why would Mike want to marry someone coerced into being with him that he doesn\u2019t even like? I don\u2019t understand this at all but your mother is clearly crossing boundaries. Not to mentioned she missed her own grandsons birthday and tried to get his mom to miss it for some guy?", "NTA keep it up with defending your sister. Your mom is freaking ridiculous.", "If I was your sister I would be tempted to invent a online boyfriend, just to get mom to f off. Mike sounds terrible. \n(To clarify- sister should not have to- but it sounds like mom does not care what sister wants.)", "NTA.\n\nReturn her words to her, then both you and your sister go NC for your own sanity.", "**Support your sister, go LC with your mom.** \n\nTell your other sibling you don't want to hear about the 'support' your mom is getting. Tell your sister to arrange a meeting with Mike where you are there for back up.

WTF is wrong with your mom.", "NTA. Mom sounds maybe like a narcissist. I am sorry for you and your sister.", "NTA. Your mother trying to set her up ONCE could be seen as well meaning. After your sister said no the first time, keeping at it is clearly being the AH.", "NTA in the slightest. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t your mom even consider her grandson\u2019s birthday? Also what century are we in where a widow has to be married to an older guy she dislikes? Wow.", "NTA. Your sister is happy and clearly content at this point in her life. Next time just say to mum why doesn't she marry Mike since she's so hellbent on trying to sell your sister, she can be Mike's broodmare", "NTA! Start a rumor that she has early onset dementia and see how she feels when people ignore her feelings because they aren\u2019t really in the moment.

But even with that it took years before I was ready to even think about dating again. People tried pushing it, I was too young to be alone blah, blah, blah. It hurt me a lot. The thought of loving, then losing another husband was terrifying to me. Now yes I have been remarried for 2 years now, we've been together 5. Pushing your sister this way will backfire on your mom. Just stand with her, your sister needs your support more now than ever.", "NTA. Your mom is terrible to your sister.
