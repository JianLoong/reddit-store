Send a message to your dad and say that while you're sorry the truth made Mom cry, but she needed to hear some harsh truths. Tell him everything that has been happening and say that Mom is hurting and alienating your sister, regardless of her intentions.", "NTA. You and sis should write out very clearly all the reasons why Mike is horrible and inappropriate for her, all the ways your mom has been a horrible mother by trying to force him on her, and send it to everyone in the family/friend circle before going no contact with your parents. I'm usually not a proponent of the nuclear option, but parents who try to force their children to do something that will hurt them disgust me.\n\nIt sounds like your parents are living in a cultural delusion (are you ethnically Indian, by any chance?) that you and sister aren't willing to participate in. If they're acting like this when you're both adults who have married, I'm not sure it's worth maintaining the relationship.", "OOP said elsewhere that mom hated BIL and by proxy her own grandchildren.\n\nBut Mike(unlike BIL) is from the same culture/religion as mom and he has some money, so marrying her daughter off to Mike like she is some kid of broodmare, will moste likely 1: give mom the \"right kind\" of grandchildren and 2: she will get access to Mike's money because \"respect your elders\" and crap like that.", "Why is Mike around all the time? Is it just a super small town?\n\nVery much NTA. Even if your sister was extremely interested in remarrying, Mike should NOT be on even the long list of candidates.", "Why can't people just learn to keep the kids out of it?! And also did she really expect them to be okay with her basically being like \"all you need to do is become Mike's wife so I can have my rent money\" how about noooo???? Eesh what a melon...", "No he sounds perfect for the mother. \n\nNTA op not at all.", "Was it that obvious lol.", "Oh, they know very well she's horrible. That's why they're siding with her even though she's completely over the line. They're trying to avoid her anger, and steadying that boat."]}
