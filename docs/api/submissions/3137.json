Does she secretly want him for herself?", "Yea, Yea it is.", "But Mike called her grandson horrible things and she\u2019s ok with that? I\u2019m so confused on why your mom\u2019s loyalty to Mike is stronger than her loyalty to her family. Who is this Mike?", "Like someone else brought up, could it be slightly plausible that your mom is in love with Mike and is trying live vicarious through your sister?", "Talk to your mother. Tell her to stop pimping out her daughter to weirdos.", "Has your mom ever given any sort of reason why she's obsessed with getting your sister married if to a man that she can't stand who treats her sons like garbage?  Like, is Mike paying your mom to pay matchmaker?  Does she think your sister just absolutely needs to be married to survive, even though she's clearly managed for years, and Mike is the only guy around?  None of this changes anything,  NTA, I just would love to know what is going on inside of your mom's brain that she's pushing so hard for something that is obviously a terrible match and horrible idea, to the point of hurting her own kid and grandkids.", "INFO: Does Mike happen to have a lot of money? Or a job that implies as much? \n\nThe only other reason I can think of why she could be pushing the issue this much is very old fashioned attitude/religious that women can\u2019t be alone or raise children alone.", "How do you guys even know this guy?", "Does your mom have a key to your sister's house? I feel like a normal man, who has been declined several times, would have extracted himself from this situation by now. \n\nWhat kind of promises has your mother been making to him? Is he helping her (with money perhaps) in some way, and now he expects \"repayment\"?", "Agreed, and men can live without women if they choose or need.\n\nHowever, it's not what most people are trained for, and should therefore be a concern for anyone who cares about another person who's had a significant loss, at least until that person has evidenced satisfaction with where they're at, as OP's  sister has done. Interfere, no - question and express care and concern, yes.", "That\u2019s interesting. I thought you were an adult but was puzzled that your dad said to apologize \u201cor else.\u201d Or else what?", "Money", "If the mom likes Mike so much, maybe she should marry him.", "Someone mentioned money, and now I'm wondering if he's helping the family in some way, and OP's mom has made certain promises as a form of repayment.", "It\u2019s possible OP\u2019s mother doesn\u2019t really view the kids as a proper part of her family because of her dislike of their father. It\u2019s not something a rational sane person would think but given her behaviour it seems like she isn\u2019t one. OP is NTA in any way shape or form.", "Yes, why does she want her daughter to marry a man who would treat her grandsons horribly?", "In my experience, or else means \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything on the fly appropriate to threaten you with\u201d \n\n\nDad will probably figure it out in the shower", "Info: WTF is wrong with your mum? (Also obviously NTA)", "Your mother is fucking broken and none of you should engage with her again.", "Wow", "Is this a change from past behavior? Is there a chance this is a sign of early dementia? Or does Mike just have a crapload of money or something?", "This is so wrong, yet so plausible", "My first thought too.", "I\u2019m gonna guess the list of things wrong with that woman is much too long for a single Reddit post."]}
