The lesson you were trying to teach was absolutely a good one that young children need to learn. Actions have consequences. The problem is that it's been WAY too long for a 5 year old to put the consequence to the action. It's been a week since the incident which is an incredibly long time for a 5 year old. This is like your insurance suddenly tripling your rates because they found out about a parking ticket from 15 years ago. You'd be angry and confused too.  \n\n\nIf you're going to dish out consequences, it needs to be in a reasonable time frame for the age. Though severe punishments should be left to the parents. Redirection works well. Making some paper crowns would of been fun. Or change the game that now the crown has broke, you have unlocked your fairy cosmic powers.", "I can see what you were trying to do, but the action and the punishment were too far apart to really make sense to a 5 year old.

Five is definitely old enough to know what she did was not ok. NTA", "NTA. Children are very short sighted because they lack empathy. But without teaching them lessons as you have done, they become short sighted and unempathetic adults.", "NTA", "X would be thinking about how they'd feel if someone did that to them. Once they come to the conclusion \"bad\", I'd ask them to think about how their sibling feels. I'd give them a few minutes to think about it for themselves if they couldn't respond right away. \"You can think about that and take your time. I'll be back in 5 minutes and we'll talk about this, ok?\".\nThen I'd ask them if they think apologizing to their sibling would make things better for them and help them prepare if they didn't know what to say (again: let them think about it first).\n\nIssue is, they're little. They don't know how to handle emotions, and in this case, Fs madness and jealousy got punished, which helps with learning consequences, but not how to deal with one's own bad emotions. She might build up resentment or guilt because she doesn't have the tools how to process and overcome bad behaviour. F needs to be seen, too. \"You're mad you broke your crown, right? I know it was an accident. Accidents suck. But sometimes, they happen anyways. // How do you feel about that? // Any idea, how to deal with bad things happening?\"", "I don't think it's irrational. It's just irrational to adults who know how to deal with their emotions and that breaking other people's belongings is wrong.\n\nIn toddler logic, there were 2 people who owned a crown each, happily playing together. Then, out of bad fortune, crown A got destroyed (remember: she didn't break her own on purpose. Accidents are bad luck and happen to everyone. Toddlers are just more clumsy). While A was mourning her crown,  all people who were equals before told her to downgrade to her old crown and keep the mood up. This felt unfair, because no-one helped her deal with the loss of the crown and the experience of losing something joyful suddenly, while feeling excluded. It just feels unfair in general.\nTo make it more fair, and because losing a crown is no big deal apparently, she broke the other crown as well. \n\nI know it's wrong, but for a toddler, it makes sense. Imagine you're driving a Tesla and your spouse drives one, too. You both run errands easily because you make good use of the big trunk, the safety of the car and the speed it comes with. It usually is easy to drive, the seats are comfy. Then one day, the streets are iced and you total the car by accident. Your spouse tells you to just run all the errands you're doing with the old messed-up Kia you owned as a teen. It's slow, smelly, loud, uncomfortable, with one broken light, a small trunk, a stuck door handle and the window shield won't ever get clean, no matter how much you try. While you think of all that, your spouse, still happily driving their Tesla tells you to lighten up and hurry to come back doing your chores. \n\nHow'd you feel? Would you be light-hearted, enjoying the luck that you still got the old Kia as back-up? Or would you be mad at your spouse for not comforting you? Would you worry about all the extra to-dos that suddenly add up to the same tasks, you're supposed to do with worse tools? Would you think: Easy to say \"suck it up\", if you still have a Tesla to drive\"?", "I would have left off at the two broken crowns and let their mother handle the rest.", "Woaaaaah Nelly. Obviously this situation/topic is deeper than my one sentence, my comment was lighthearted on purpose. **Obviously** it\u2019s not irrational in the child\u2019s mind. \n\nI have two children and study psychology, you\u2019re preaching to the choir.\n\nAll in all, still a good lesson for the kid. Big picture is: you should to take care of your possessions or at the very least not break others. And you\u2019re not going to be rewarded for revenge.", "Sorry, this wasn't meant to be offensive, just as an exchange about perspective. You know how the internet works. People might read this and don't see any more depth to it because they don't know. \nAlso, I'd prefer if you'd not call me Nelly. Idk what that's supposed to mean but that's not my name and I'm sure it's not nice.", "Additionally, your car analogy isn\u2019t close to the same principles, lessons, mistakes, or requests, not even in essence. \n\nYou also left out the part where I destroy my husbands Tesla because I\u2019m upset I have to drive my old car for a week. That\u2019d be insane, and illegal.\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not a horrible unfair thing to drive my old car. That\u2019s why you should keep your old reliable car, incase you new one breaks. You don\u2019t throw a fit and destroy property because your husband is trying to have an optimistic outlook instead of acting like using an old car is a tragedy.\n\nEdit to add: the husband in your analogy is not wrong with being positive (asking to do chores part makes no sense so I\u2019m gonna leave that out lol). And yes I\u2019d be VERY thankful that I have a SECOND VEHICLE. That is a luxury. Also, if an adult we\u2019re to throw a fit to the point of needing comforting/consoling because they had to drive their *second car* that isn\u2019t super nice, they\u2019re a spoiled brat lol.", "The term \u201cwoah Nelly\u201d is just a catchphrase said throughout history/society that came from a racing movie. \n\n\u201cNellybelle\u201d is the name of the characters car, and the character would say it as he was slowing down/race was ending.\n\nPeople commonly say it in place of \u201cslow down\u201d or \u201cchill out\u201d", "Of course you don't do that. That's not my point and I think I said that. That's also why I \"left out\" that part. Point is, that emotions need progress. An adult wouldn't be mad about a broken toy, but would be mad about a broken car. Hence the example.", "Thanks for explaining. Didn't know that. Still confused why I should slow down tho. Was I wrong?", "Emotions do need progress, which is why this situation was a good learning lesson. \n\nWe don\u2019t express anger by breaking other kids toys.", "No! it was just because of my surprise when I realized your comment was a lengthy psychological analysis, I didn\u2019t expect it. And was half-worried it was going to be an accusation of me hating kids or something lol. \n\nSo my \u201cWoah Nelly\u201d was basically my own silly version of \u201coh no, don\u2019t yell at me!\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude05\u201d", "Again, I'm not saying it was a bad lesson. I'm just saying without help in how to process those emotions better and how to deal with mess-ups, the lesson is less valuable than it could be.", "Nah, no yelling intended, promised! :)"]}
