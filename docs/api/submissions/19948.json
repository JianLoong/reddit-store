But that she can earn a new crown by doing X.  X being whatever you think is the best way to teach her the lesson that it is wrong to hurt others by destroying their property and that when one hurts another they must make it right by apologizing and doing something to make it right for the person they hurt.", "NTA you just gave her a lesson that there are consequences to her actions.", "INFO: are their parents aware of the situation? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a bad thing to take the opportunity of a learning moment, but i think it should be up to the parents how you go about this situation.

She needs to learn that she shouldn't bully her way into making a situation \"fair\", especially when her lack of something was caused by her own mistake. Good on you, and I would take more time to explain why what she did wasn't right. \n\n\"How would you feel if it was J who accidentally broke her crown and then broke yours on purpose? What about if you both had an ice cream cone and J dropped hers so she made you drop yours too? What if everyone in the world acted like that?\"\n\nIt's a good learning opportunity.

It isn't even about her having another one. She broke J's crown, she does not get another.", "NTA\n\nwell done\n\nyou gave her a lesson about consequences", "I'm going between YTA and NAH. The lesson you were trying to teach was absolutely a good one that young children need to learn. Actions have consequences. The problem is that it's been WAY too long for a 5 year old to put the consequence to the action. It's been a week since the incident which is an incredibly long time for a 5 year old. This is like your insurance suddenly tripling your rates because they found out about a parking ticket from 15 years ago. You'd be angry and confused too.  \n\n\nIf you're going to dish out consequences, it needs to be in a reasonable time frame for the age. Though severe punishments should be left to the parents. Redirection works well. Making some paper crowns would of been fun. Or change the game that now the crown has broke, you have unlocked your fairy cosmic powers.", "I can see what you were trying to do, but the action and the punishment were too far apart to really make sense to a 5 year old. They need consequences in the moment, not a week later.\n\nNTA, but next time, an appropriate punishment would be to let J wear F's intact crown for the rest of the day, or something like that.", "ESH\n\nShe broke the other crown on purpose which is a jerk move to do, but she's a kid so I get it. The time to address that issue was *right then* giving her a timeout or having her repair the crown she broke and say sorry. Not two weeks later singling her out in retaliation.", "yta... they are 4 and 5....i get you want to teach something.. but i dont think thats how you do it....\n\n\nMaybe scare her and have her acknowlege that breaking her sisters crown was a bad idea... ands the good kid to decide if her sister should also gwt a crown and have everyone talk.\n\nat 4 or 5 they are super impressionable, you can convince the one she was wrong for breaking the crown and the other that its better to forgive her sister so everyone can play together and the house can have 2 beautifil princesses.\n\nYou obvious care about your cousins,.. keep caring and those littlw ah mistakes wont matter in the end....at the end...you nta for obviously caring for your cousins.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
