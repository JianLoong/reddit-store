Your house, yours rules. You helped her out when she was in a bad place, she took advantage of that by pushing it too far. If her dogs can't behave around you and your dog he has to go. If she says no, she goes too.\nShe also pushed it a lot by letting the dog crap all over and not clean it up, she's at someone else's house and that's incredibly inconsiderate.", "Post back on Facebook that it is just her dog that you hate.   Then a small explanation\u2026yes cousin I do have an intense dislike to your dog.  Maybe because of the dog dodo that is all over the yard and walkway that you won\u2019t clean up.

As long as she's a guest you can throw her out at any time and call the police if she doesn't leave willingly.\n\nOnce she's a tenant that process takes a lot longer (years in the worst case).
