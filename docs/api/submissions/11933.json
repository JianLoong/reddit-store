Just because you\u2019re the older sister doesn\u2019t automatically mean you need to provide for her. Yes you should support and help her which you are already doing despite having it rough for yourself.

She is ultimately responsible for her life, just like you are responsible for your life.", "NTA --- You can't help those that won't help themselves, why should she get a job when you and your mother do everything for her, talk to your mother and cut off the money and help if she wanted a baby then it's her job to care for it also.", "NTA and it looks like your sister needs more than a kick up her backside. Why do some people fall for the worst loosers of all times and then ruin their lives potential. Having a baby with no prospects is one of the worst things one could do and to top it up she doesn't even want to work but expect you and your mom to care for her and the baby. You have your life to look for and there's only so much one can do as a sibling.

You can only give so much but I would be mindful with the resentment and anger you feel for her \u201cthrowing away her life.\u201d What\u2019s done is done and she has a degree so hopefully she will use it. Life throws us curveballs. I do however don\u2019t think you should go into debt for an adult who is capable of providing for themselves. Your sister is TA for insulting you after the help you have provided. She is acting entitled. But if this doesn\u2019t seem normal of her until recently\u2026please look into PPD.

You are NOT her parent.  She is an adult with a child and needs to be treated like one.  As long as you continue to provide for her, she will continue to sit on the couch and do nothing.  You've done enough.  Time to look out for you and you alone.", "NTA\n\nPlease do not give your sister any more money.

So your sister is absolutely right- \"family helps family.\" So she needs to start helping you by making sure you don't accumulate debt on her behalf and should show some gratitude for the help you already provided her by attempting to stand on her feet. Because family helps family. You already helped her, she needs to help you too. You're not leaving her to drown, you already got her to shallower waters, she just needs to stand up. \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA.", "And I\u2019d say the \u201c2 moms\u201d are OP and her mother. The sister isn\u2019t doing anything.\nBoth of them struggled enough to get the other kids to adulthood. \nThe mom should be able to relax a bit now and OP should be able to focus on establishing herself."]}
