Life throws us curveballs. I do however don\u2019t think you should go into debt for an adult who is capable of providing for themselves.

While you and your mother worked hard to give her what she needed, she just took it for granted. If you don\u2019t put a stop to it, she will never stop.

You are NOT her parent.  She is an adult with a child and needs to be treated like one.  As long as you continue to provide for her, she will continue to sit on the couch and do nothing.

So your sister is absolutely right- \"family helps family.\" So she needs to start helping you by making sure you don't accumulate debt on her behalf and should show some gratitude for the help you already provided her by attempting to stand on her feet.

You are family so she should be helping you too... buy looking for a job, doing more to support the rest of you, helping your mother with her hurt back, cleaning. Supporting family does not mean some family members get to sit on their butts all day. That no longer makes you a family, but servants instead.", "Hey op you're NTA, but you are enabling her. She's a full grown adult with a child, it's time for her to find her way in the world without your money. When you financially support her, you don't allow her to learn or grow as an adult. It's time for the consequences to meet your sister. People will be mad at you but its the best thing you could do for your sister. Literal tough love.", "NTA. Ask your sister why she reproduced with a deadbeat yet unfairly seeks to saddle you with the responsibility of caring for the child.

She could very well get pregnant again. She will leech off you for decades if you let her. Your mother has been enabling her too by taking care of her child.

Hell no! \n\nBTW: was does \"getting pregnant for a scammer\" mean?", "NTA.  Little sister needs to take responsibility for her life and her child.  It's ok to give her a hand, but you are not obligated to support her and her baby.

She's an adult and a mother now. She needs to do her job and take responsibility and care of her child. If she can not or will not then she needs to put the child up for adoption.

Also if your mom is around, I'm concerned about your parentification - you need to focus on you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr please hold on your boundary, focus on you, and give your sister love but no money.", "NTA honestly, your sister has an education.

You've done enough for everyone else.  NTA.", "NTA\u2014she\u2019s going to drain you dry and this child is not your responsibility (and, tbh, neither is your sister). Take care of yourself. And remember that taking care of family is a kindness, not an obligation\u2014and certainly not one for leeches.", "The baby is still young enough to need breastfeeding. I had a hard time getting a job when the kids were school aged, I can only imagine how difficult it would be to get a job while breastfeeding, especially depending on how little the little'un is.\n\nShe might just not be on the timeline OP expects, and OP might have a skewed idea of what that should look like.\n\nBut OP still doesn't owe the sister anything, especially as they're in the same boat financially.", "Exactly what I meant \ud83d\ude09"]}
