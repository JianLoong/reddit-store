Your parent gave you multiple cars 2. They paid for the maintenance on the car 3. It is their car--they literally own it. 4. Your father agreed to give you what he believes was thousand dollars toward a new car. This was very generous of him. However, it was not a contract; it was not something he had to do.

If it was this straight forward then it makes no sense why everyone went from fine with you selling the car to being angry with you for not giving them some of the money. How does your brother even factor into this when it was your sister's car? Why would your dad go from empathizing with your COVID financial woes to wanting money that it sounds like he doesn't need?", "NTA, I don't know who you suckered into buying a car that used for 4K but more power to you.", "Info:  whose name is on the title?", "NTA, So Dad thinks it's okay to break a promise. Nice. You'd think he would instead be happy for your good fortune.", "INFO: how could you legally sell a car your parents held title to?", "That was exactly my thinking, he could\u2019ve just taken the credit for being an amazing father and letting me be extra greatful but instead he made me feel guilty about needing the money", "I would\u2019ve considered it but I\u2019m kinda hurt for money right now, 6 months ago right when it happened I was doing better financially and also trying to buy a house", "NTA.  And if you want to be generous, which you don't have to be, give him $500.  That's half of the thousand he thought you would get.", "The idea is to help OP get a different car. More monet.

The father or the brother?", "Where does OP state that he isn't grateful for the car?", "I don\u2019t feel there is much missing context but I\u2019ll explain, like others have pointed out, my brother and dad thought the car was only worth 1000$, and I sold it for 4x that amount. My brother factors in because he\u2019s jealous that he never got to sell one of the family cars. Meanwhile due to the Covid housing boom my brother owns about 1.5 million in real estate while I struggled to recently buy my 200k house. What helped him made me struggle financially and my parents see this", "That was kinda my thought process, he told me I could have the money 6 months before I actually sold it.I financially planned on being able to sell the car for what I thought it was worth and then wanted 2000$ from me after the fact, I was also buying a house during the time period", "My dad signed the title", "[deleted]", "I am a father (which might bias me), but no, I\u2019m not their father.

These seem like very generous parents.", "Yes very grateful, I know I\u2019m privileged with stuff", "You should have gotten a pat on the back for being aware of true value of the car and another one for the work you put in to the car to maximize the value.\n\nNTA", "OP told then what it was worth. They didn't believe it.", "So you think it's okay for the father to go back on his word? I would think that at least some fathers would be happy for their child's good fortune.", "It seems a bit of a stretch to say he went back on his word. Remember we only have one biased side. I hear that he said he could sell the car for a thousand dollars and keep the thousand dollars. It was a gift (and to be clear\u2014it was a gift) of a thousand dollars, not four thousand. \n\nA gift in a family is not a legal contract between strangers. What you are ignoring is that the father was being kind to give a thousand dollars at all (much less two free cars). He did not have to do any of these things.\n\nHow can you say some is an asshole who gives away a thousand or two thousand dollars, because we won\u2019t give 4? \n\nThat, to me, seems spoiled if I\u2019m being honest."]}
