When I cook with leftovers/second meals intentionally included in the meal, I put the food intended for those second meals away before I serve dinner.

Be respectful of the partners cooking dinner, OP is NTA", "Ya I think it\u2019s crazy people are acting like this isn\u2019t a basic courtesy to eat while the food is fresh. My family tells everyone to dig in before they prepared their plate since they let guests go first and want everyone to enjoy the hot food while it\u2019s hot and that\u2019s traditionally rude to eat before everyone is seated but it\u2019s their request. They are actually \u201coffended\u201d if there\u2019s 8 people sitting there waiting and they are the last to grab their plate and food is just getting cold and they feel better if everyone eats while the food is it\u2019s most prime. Might be silly and if people dig in without them saying that it would probably be rude but since they are begging people to eat who am I to deprive them of that. So wasting time packing a meal for later just to go in the fridge while the fresh food is sitting there getting cold would feel impolite to me. Especially if it\u2019s at the request of the chef."]}
