When I cook with leftovers/second meals intentionally included in the meal, I put the food intended for those second meals away before I serve dinner.

My husband needs to take lunch every day so when we\u2019re serving dinner we put out our plates and then a container for him beside them. I serve our dinner portions onto the plates and then whatever\u2019s left goes into his container (and other containers if I made too much). That way we\u2019re served first and we have enough for our dinner, but the lunch is also portioned and it\u2019s really easy to just put the lid on and whack it in the fridge straight after we eat. I suggest you try something like that, and also maybe she can buy more than one lunchbox so she doesn\u2019t have to wash it straight away.", "NTA.

You're the one cooking the meal. You're putting in the work. It's a lot of energy to cook, a chore she doesn't enjoy. As the one who's doing this, you have the right to express your preference. And it would be considered poor etiquette to take from dinner options (both yours alone, and when you have guests) before dinner has been eaten and finished. So now you need to solve the situation, instead of determining who's right and wrong.\n\nDoes she help you box up leftovers afterward? I'd guess no since she says she's tired after eating and doesn't want to box after eating. This implies you cook dinner, then you do the clean alone. If she cleaned after she could easily pack at that time since she'd already be in the kitchen. Since it seems she doesn't do this, you could pack her lunches now too relieve both your stresses. Go to the kitchen, pull out her lunchbox, take it into the dining room, and pack what she wants.\n\nTechnically, this is better for her health. I went to culinary school. One of the things we were taught was if one took piping hot food, sealed it into containers, and placed it into the fridge, that this wasn't a good thing. It traps the heat in the container. The food can't cool from the snapped container easily, allowing bacteria to grow in the heated meal cooling at a very, very slow rate. Additionally, it's raising the temperature of the refrigerator by having heated containers in the fridge that aren't cooling at a quick pace.\n\nTaking lunch food after eating dinner is taking food after it's cooled down. Then it will be kept, at the proper temperature, in the fridge.

As long as OP isn't nitpicking a hundred other aspects of daily life, just let him fucking have sit down dinner before you swoop in on his freshly cooked meal. This guy is so annoyed that he made an entire reddit post, so I'm guessing he really cares, and if his wife doesn't have equally Strong Feelings about it she should let him have this and expect him to gracefully concede on the next thing that starts annoying the shit out of her.

It\u2019s hard for me to get into a movie or show w constant intermissions.", "For the love of gods this one is mine! I absolutely can\u2019t stand the smell of water/ food/ beer combined in the dishes just sitting there stinking. Then I have to touch them to load the dishwasher and just want to puke and die.

I can put food straight from the stove in Tupperware?", "I feel like if these were the case he would have said that. In fact, he said \"There\u2019s always enough food because I cook with her lunches in mind.\" and even in the OP he talks about putting leftovers away so your second point is definitely not true.\n\nHe acknowledges himself that it's petty and he doesn't know why. I think if he felt he had a good reason, he'd be telling it to us, so trying to guess that he isn't getting enough to eat for dinner, a very serious claim to make, is kinda...not cool.", "That's not his complaint though. His complaint is just that she packs it before they sit down.", "If those were the reason wouldn't he have said so? He also mentions putting the leftovers in containers *after* she's taken her lunch portion and they've eaten. He could also just plate himself first if being first is really that important to him.

Meaning different than she did. This annoyed her because she liked the towels looking uniform when stacked in the linen closet.

When dirty dishes get water splashed in them from people using said sink for various sink activities. Then you have you put your hands in said gross dirty dish water to tip it all out, put them all on the counter all wet and slimy, then clean the mess out of the sink to then fill it with clean soapy water to wash them. Then the counter needs extra wiping down from the wet slimy dishes (far easier to wipe it down when they\u2019re stacked there initially dry, and if they\u2019re stacked neatly no dirty part of the dishes actually touches the countertop). Why add all those steps when they can be stacked neatly on the counter ready to wash when you\u2019re ready?", "As a \"beside the sink\" person, it's so that I can still use the sink. \n\nWhen the sink is full of dishes, I have to empty it onto the counter just to get the stopper in so I can get ready to do dishes. I prefer to skip that step. Once I have a sink full of clean soapy water (and no dishes), I then grab and wash the dishes from the pile one at a time, fully submerging the dish that I am actively washing. \n\nAny other way seems insane to me.", "You can. It\u2019s a little better if you have glass containers, but food just being hot from the stove isn\u2019t likely to do much to the plastic.

I know it\u2019s irrational, and I need help getting to the bottom of it.\u201d Instead, she packs lunch, it makes him angry, he knows he shouldn\u2019t be angry, which makes him even angrier in a feedback loop until he explodes at his wife.

It\u2019s a very persistent myth. Putting hot food in the fridge has no significant affect on the temperature of the fridge and it means that you aren\u2019t leaving the food to sit out and cool and enter the temperature danger zone. \n\nIt is much safer to put hot food in the fridge than let it cool. \n\nhttps://www.epicurious.com/expert-advice/can-you-put-hot-food-in-the-fridge", "It is essential to learn this skill for a marraige or relationship to last.
