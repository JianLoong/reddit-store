I (23f) have a sister (21f) and a brother (18m). We never knew our dad's family. My sister was always curious about them but dad never said much. Last year my sister decided she was going to try and find out more on them. She did ancestry and 23 and Me but found no relatives from dad's family. She then decided to do her own research and found out his parents names and from there, she contacted a PI on some website and he found out their personal details.\n\nShe reached out and was ignored. So she reached out again, and again, and she continued getting no reply for months. Then she decided to show up at the home of one of dad's brothers and she learned that dad had an affair with his brother's wife and his brother's son was dad's bio kid. My sister was like ooh, we have another brother and she wanted to talk to the brother. She did get to speak to dad's bio kid once and he told her to go away and that she delivered the worst news, that dad was still alive, because he always hoped he'd died in the hole he dug for himself.\n\nBasically none of the family want to know us. My sister is so bothered by that and she keeps trying and has shamed each of them. Especially the brother who was cheated on. She said we're all family and dad should be forgiven and we shouldn't have the blame placed on us.\n\nMy sister wanted me to join her in trying to get into the family. She told me she needed me, that as her big sister, and after being rejected so many times, I have a duty to be there for her. I told her I was not going to help her harass people who want nothing to do with us. I told her she should accept that they don't want to know and that they have that right. She was like I should be supporting her, I should love her enough to do this for HER and then she said I was being \"bitchy\" because I said she was harassing people. She said she's trying to reconcile a family. I told her that might be her intention but refusing to accept their no's and go away's, she's harassing them.\n\nShe got so upset and told me I was meant to be on her side. I do feel bad that she feels so alone in this but I also think she's wrong to act like this toward them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697651898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17awzln/aita_for_not_being_more_supportive_of_my_sister/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I then said she was harassing them. The reason it might be wrong is this is something my sister has fixated on and she feels alone. I feel like maybe I should have been kinder to her and tried helping her let go vs saying what I did and reacting the way I did.

She needed to stop before she showed up at a strangers house.", "NTA, like what everybody said, your sister could end up in the police station if she keeps harassing a family member that doesn't want anything to do with you. \n\nOf course that's very sad that she is trying to find out more about the father's side of the family but if they put up a wall, then sadly she needs to accept that and move on. At least the good thing is her research you can now trace your family's history. Maybe down the line someone will reach out and reconnect the family. But what she is doing is obviously illegal and potentially dangerous too.", "NTA, and sister is well on her way to being in the receiving end of a restraining order!  She\u2019s acting very stalkerish.", "NTA, your sister needs to leave them alone. She\u2019s going to get hit with a restraining order soon.", "NTA. Your sister is a selfish person with no empathy and no emotional intelligence. You were right to tell her no and tell her why. I would suggest she goes to therapy because she is legitimately harassing these poor strangers.", "NTA its clear they dont want anything to do with you guys and I think she should respect that. she is harassing people and it sounds like its close to her stalker. showing up as there houses? that's not ok", "NTA\nYour sister is harassing people,  she's lucky nobody called the cops on her turning up at somebodys door when they had obviously not wanted any contact.  She probably needs professional help because she's at obsessed with this.", "NTA She needs to leave them alone. She's already been told MULTIPLE times that they want no relationship with her. I wouldn't blame them if they got a restraining order. She is way out of line.", "NTA. You're exactly right.\n\nYour sister is having trouble understanding that just because she wants something, doesn't mean she's entitled to it.\n\nA good way for her to learn? Let her keep going until she's arrested/restraining order/etc.\n\nSome people gotta learn the hard way", "NTA. This is the type of thing that birthed the phrase that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. She means well but is clearly not understanding that you cannot force a family and  I'm shocked that it wasn't enough for her to be told off by your half brother/cousin. You can show her this and also try to get her to see that you ARE on HER side, but clearly nobody wants contact with that side of the family and she needs to leave it alone. She really should have gotten the hint when she got no reply for months.", "NTA. Your sister is delusional, she needs therapy. No one has an obligation to accept total strangers into their midst, regardless of bloodlines.", "I feel bad for her too. But I agree that she is harassing people.", "NTA\n\nYour dad should have told you all that the reason he has no family is because they disowned him for being a cheater and betraying his brother. However, she is harassing them and being ridiculous so supporting her in her quest is only going to make things worse.", "She will not harass herself into these people's lives.

She needs therapy.  She can\u2019t expect people to forgive a man that essentially blew up their family.
