We started having conversations during our shifts and started to get to know each other. She eventually hit me up on insta after one of our shifts and we continued put conversation on there. \n\nAfter a while, she started to get a little flirty with me and I reciprocated that back. Shes a cute girl and I've never had a girl try and talk to me like that before so I just went with it.\n \nShe eventually asked me to go to the beach with her and I said sure and asked how are we gonna get there. she responded with \"oh my mom can take us\". I thought that was weird so I asked how old she was and she told me 16, and that it's alright if we have a relationship as long as no one finds out. That when I realized this girl is a little crazy. She also had been posting non-stop stories on her insta aimed at me. I decided that I didn't want to deal with her so I told her  \"maybe we can find a time we are both off to go to the beach but I don't know right now\"\n\nI felt that I was kinda leading her on as I now knew her age and didn't really feel comfortable with it so I told her the next morning that she is cute but the age difference is too much. She said alright and that we can still be friends. I thought it was gonna be smooth sailing but it just got worse.\n\nThis girl wanted to spend every minute with me I swear. She would text me all the time and if I didn't respond soon enough she would make more stories about how people don't respond fast or leave people on read. I had gotten her discord so we had been playing games and she would text me asking to play anytime I was on. And when I played with others she would complain. \n\nWhile at work she was very touchy and was trying to tickle me and just being flirty in general. I am not very good with conflict so I just brushed it off and tried to not respond.\n\nBut then she started to get flirty with me in discord, and not just regular flirting, like kinda sexual stuff. She sent me stuff like \"I bet you're good with your hands since you play games\" which made me mega uncomfortable. And she would be very jealous of the other girls I have know for a while when I play with them separately or together. She accused me of flirting with them and stuff. I asked her why are you jealous and she said shes not.\n\nI just wanted to not really deal with this girl so I sent this paragraph to her\ny\"ou gotta understand that you can't be sending me shit like last night, it makes me uncomfortable. We're at different stages in life and you should be trying to find friends and people that you can relate better with. You need to find a relationship where someone reciprocates your feelings.\"\n\nShe ended up getting mad at me and said you wanted me first, and that she was gonna go cry. Maybe I could've worded the rejection better or did I lead her on for too long. I really think she was just starved for attention and was looking for that in me. \nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1691105701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hjs1w/aita_for_how_i_rejected_this_girls_advances/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not ok, and it tends to be a learning slope. \n\nThe thing is the older guys tend to be a bit more aware of how they talk to you, listen a bit more and are more respectful in general. It gets misconstrued because we all want that, and yet at that age often we don't give the same respect in return. \n\nDon't feel too bad about it. It's nice to know that you are aware you may have lead her on a bit, but heck if she were your age and you learned things that changed your mind about dating her you wouldn't be beating yourself up about leading her on. \n\nShe knows the age thing is an issue, she basically said so when she said you could keep it secret.
