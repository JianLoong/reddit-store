It was unexpected but we were both happy about it, until a week or so later there was blood and I ended up having a miscarriage.\n\nFast forward to today and I\u2019m now about 11 weeks pregnant with our second pregnancy and have my first scan next week. However this morning I woke up and found some blood, not loads but not a tiny amount either. I spoke to him about it and i said if theres anymore we need to go to the hospital so they can do a scan. He was supposed to go out to watch the football later and i assumed when i said that we may need to go to the hospital that he would cancel. Unfortunately my assumptions were incorrect and he still wanted to go. I got upset and initially didn\u2019t say anything about it but when he kept asking what was wrong i eventually told him \u2018i didn\u2019t want to tell him what to do or if he should go out or not, but what he decides will show how he feels about the situation.\u2019 He then said \u2018so you\u2019re saying i don\u2019t care about you or my child? nice\u2019 and he then told his mate he cant go out which made me feel like i\u2019m the one thats banned him or something.\n\nI understand people react differently in different situations, and maybe i shouldn\u2019t of given him an ultimatum as i know he does care, but seeing as though we\u2019ve been through this already before i thought he would understand me worrying about having to go to the hospital and he would want to be there instead of going out. AITA?\n\nEdit : Not that it makes a difference but in case anyone was wondering Im 21 and my boyfriend is 23.\n\nEdit 2 : I understand im the AH for how i handled it and what i said, i have since apologised to him and i understand that i really shouldn\u2019t have said what i said. For those saying i should have just gone to the hospital at the first sign of blood, the wait times are ridiculous where i live in a&e (i live in the uk) and most times they wont do much unless you\u2019ve lost a lot more blood. Last time i called an ambulance and they said its a \u2018simple miscarriage\u2019 and that was that.\nSecondly i understand and appreciate everyones opinions on whether or not me and my partner should have a child, but i don\u2019t think thats warranted. People can choose at what age they feel as though they can raise a child, im no stranger to children and appreciate how difficult it can be, yes i know having your own child is different. However these difficulties can be at any age as only when you have a child you will know exactly what its like.\nBoth me and my partner want this pregnancy, he has also been through a miscarriage in his last relationship which did affect him a lot. I wasnt sure i wanted children until i was pregnant, and due to person reasons which i wont state, that is why i am still pregnant. My boyfriend is also the only person i have not used birth control with, if thats relevant.", "created_utc": 1671633190, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zro842/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_if_he_goes_out_he/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then you expected him to pre-cancel his plans just in case?\n\nYou had blood before a miscarriage in your first pregnancy, but even with that knowledge, the sight of blood this time STILL didn't ring alarm bells enough for YOU to want to immediately go to the hospital, so why should he be more worried about it than you are?\n\nIf you wanted him to cancel his plans and stay with you, I understand, but you didn't tell him that.

Esh for all this childish stuff", "I am so sorry for your loss.  This is a difficult situation.\n\nThe baby's health is DEFINITELY more important than a sports game on tv, and you are NTA for being upset, because he didn't seem very concerned about the health issues you are having.  IT'S SCARY!!!  Your partner should definitely be there, especially since you've already been through this one time.  I am thinking the surprise first pregnancy maybe wasn't as welcome to him as it was to you and therefore the loss of it didn't affect him as deeply, men don't get the physical connection with a life growing in their body, so they don't \"get it\" sometimes.  It's emotionally taxing just being pregnant, let alone miscarrying.  Hormones, physical changes and our shoes not fitting can make us kind of a big ol' mess, I really didn't like being pregnant, I LOVED knowing a baby was coming, just not the discomfort.  But men don't get that connection like women do, so there may sometimes be a disconnect for his emotions and concerns...plus, it's also scary for him too, and guys don't really do too well with \"scary health things\" for the most part.  Some do, but most men that I've known are not great with that stuff.  That's okay, we just deal with stuff differently.  He may have been worried but not known how to deal with it.  Guys can be weird. (They think women can be weird, so it all evens out. LOL)\n\nNow, I have a difficult question for you:  Was **he** really prepared to be pregnant with you?  Maybe he hadn't considered it happening in \"his timeline\" yet.  **HAVE A CONVERSATION with him.**  Ask him what his timeline for milestone events is.  When does he expect to get married, buy a house, have kids -too late-, retire...ALL OF THE THINGS that you do when you plan a life.  He may or may not have a plan, and that may not be a problem if you're under 27, but if you are approaching 30 or older, then y'all need to have plans.  Even if you don't manage to have everything planned out, at least get some of the important things like kids and marriage timelines down somewhat.  He may be feeling pressured because you've been together a year and to him that isn't enough time, while for you it may be plenty.  Again, HAVE A CONVERSATION.\n\nFrom your post, it sounds like you two may not really be on the same page when it comes to this relationship or parenthood.  I would advise that you both need to seriously consider if this is the PARTNER you want to share your LIFE WITH, or at least the next twenty years.  Can you see yourself with this person?  Can you be their PARTNER, not a doormat, and not a controlling crazy person in a tug of war with someone who is just not suited well to a relationship with YOU.  **There is no right and wrong in realizing you are not suited** for a long term partnership with someone, it just means you are not suited for EACH OTHER.  While a specific person may make life with you miserable, they could make someone else perfectly happy.\n\nBeing pregnant makes you especially emotional and vulnerable, **so please be kind to yourself**.  I know these are hard conversations to have, but it really needs to be done in order for you to move forward in parenthood and this relationship.  I hope this works out for you.  I hope you and baby stay healthy.  I also hope you and boyfriend can have some talks and find out how well you two really are suited for each other.  Don't expect to have the talks ALL AT THE SAME TIME, space out the conversations because heavy stuff can SOMETIMES turn off a guy's brain after about thirty minutes, so be patient, but definitely have those conversations.", "ESH but mostly you. If you wanted him to cancel, you should have just asked. You manipulated him to get your way by telling him that if he goes out, you'll know he doesn't love you or your child. That's hella gross, honestly. Grow up if you're going to be a parent. Learn to communicate.", "YTA. I will never understand why some women seem to think they suddenly become absolutely helpless when they are pregnant. You can't pick up a phone and call him **if** you ended up needing him?", "NTA but do you really want to have a child with someone you have only known a year who doesn\u2019t automatically consider your health a priority? That is a good way to end up stuck dealing with the dude for the next 18 years one way or another.", "YTA - don\u2019t make assumptions, don\u2019t punish your partner by pouting and being silently angry.

Yes, he *absolutely* should have offered to go with you, given the severity of the concern.\n\nBut him being a little insensitive about going with you (because he can't *treat* you, he would only be present for moral support) was then met with 1. you not communicating 2. you then implying he doesn't care about your pregnancy - that's a bit much.", "ESH\n\nThere is a breakdown of communication on both sides.\n\n1) Something that could become a serious consequence following already suffering through a miscarriage should be taken more seriously by your boyfriend.

A&E and especially calling 999 are not appropriate for a possible or early miscarriage and I wanted to share with you where you can find the right help. \n\nCall an ambulance only if someone is in danger of dying before they can get to the hospital, or if it\u2019s physically impossible to get them to the hospital safely. Heart attack, very badly broken limbs, very heavy bleeding (pouring/gushing, not oozing/dripping), possible serious back, neck or head injury. Going into labour so quickly that you can\u2019t get to a hospital. Things where you need highly trained medical help right now, right where you are. \n\nGo to A&E if you need medical help immediately to deal with a new problem which is or could deteriorate to become a threat to life or limb. Broken arm, bleeding which won\u2019t stop, symptoms of sepsis, stroke, heart attack, vomiting absolutely everything to the point you are dehydrated. (Obviously lower threshold in little kids and particularly in infants - I\u2019m talking adults.) For less urgent stuff, use 111, your GP, and walk-in centres. \n\nFor a possible miscarriage or anything of that nature, you don\u2019t need an ambulance (unless you\u2019re literally bleeding to death), and if you show up at A&E they\u2019ll only send you to gynaecology, or have you book an appointment with the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit if your town has one. If you have a women\u2019s hospital, they usually have an emergency gynae service with a phone number, often 24 hour with a nurse to talk to at the other end - try Googling for early pregnancy assessment unit and wherever you live. There are 200 in the UK so nobody is too far from one. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. That's a scary situation for any woman, even more so becs you've already been.rhrough the loss once.

Would probably have it as ESH because if that was me in the bf\u2019s position then improbably would have insisted that we go to the hospital straight away, but then again, if OP didn\u2019t seem bothered enough to go to the hospital in the first place it\u2019s not hard to see how he\u2019s come to the conclusion that it\u2019s no big deal and not something to abandon plans over.", "Having been in this situation (having experienced both potential outcomes in different pregnancies) she is following the exact advice a medical professional would give her. \n\nSpotting is relatively common in pregnancies, and this early into a pregnancy there is nothing that can be done to prevent a miscarriage if that is the cause, so the advice is to wait and see if it gets worse, but be prepared to rush to the hospital in an emergency because if the pregnancy is ectopic it can escalate rapidly and the sooner you get medical treatment the better the outcomes for the mother.\n\nIt\u2019s beyond me why we don\u2019t teach people this stuff so that partners understand that if their pregnant partner is experiencing bleeding then obviously they need to cancel plans and be available and supportive.\n\nHow traumatised would you feel if you lost both your unborn child and your partner while you were out watching football?", "There shouldn\u2019t even have to be a test, a possible miscarriage trumps plans for a football game with the bros AUTOMATICALLY. The fact that she had to question him because he didn\u2019t prioritize his pregnant girlfriend who recently had a miscarriage already so is terrified.", "In this situation, even without prompting by the OP, the boyfriend has displayed the intelligence and empathy of a door knob.", "I would have been been kind of okay with him going down the road to a pub or something to watch the football, but he was going 1 and half hours on a train away so wouldnt be able to get back in an emergency. Also he is the one mainly who wanted to have a child, he loves the idea of becoming a dad, i just think he doesn\u2019t think sometimes about things.", "He was going to be 1 and a half hours away by train, i probably wouldn\u2019t have minded as much had he been close by in town or something.", "It was, which was why i was concerned, plus even though some bleeding can be normal, because of what has happened to me blood just means things are going wrong. Which is why im worrying.", "Ive known him for about 5 years and he has lived with me for a while so we do know each other quite well. I admit the way I said things and handled it wasn\u2019t right and i do need to apologise, but he knows i wont go to a hospital by myself as i broke my arm a few months ago and wouldn\u2019t go to the hospital all day until someone came. This is something I\u2019m working on before the babies here. I guess i went with assumptions rather then normal communication which i know isnt the best thing to do but its my way of thinking sometimes", "I can see how what i said would seem that way, which is why i feel horrible for saying it. However i am a big believer in peoples actions will show you how they feel, which i would say most people agree with, so i don\u2019t see the problem in stating that fact\u2026 ?", "It\u2019s not so much the work and responsibility everyone is concerned with, although they are indeed factors to be considered. It\u2019s that you and your boyfriend are so *immature*. You have a lot of growing up to do yourselves before you start your own family.", "I hope both of y\u2019all go on birth control after this. It\u2019s up to you, but if you don\u2019t I\u2019ll know you don\u2019t love your children.", "Figures.\n\nESH.\n\nHe doesn't sound like he's mentally ready to be a parent if the well being of his unborn child is at potental risk and his mind is more concerned about football. Even if you do end up having his child, I get the uneasy feeling you're on the fast track to becoming a single mother, as he doesn't exactly come across as someone with the right priorities for parenthood and will stick around.\n\nAnd the way you communicate is still quite immature, not unexpected for your age, however you'll need to find much better ways to communicate and speak up for yourself if you plan on being a parent yourself.", "Yeah try a good ol implant after this, immature people with unhealthy communication skills and relationship issues should not be having kids.", "I wouldnt have been as upset if it was just in town or something, but he was going 1 and half hours away by train, which meant he was too far in case of something happening.", "Right. If I were in that position, my gf's first pregnancy had ended with surprise blood and a miscarriage and then during the second pregnancy she woke up and found blood, i'd be advocating for immediately getting out of bed and going to the hospital. I wouldn't want to 'wait and see if there's more'. If my gf was so nonplussed that she actively wanted to just wait it out, then we'd still have the discussion about staying in communication throughout the day, but beyond that, what else is there to do but go on about your day?", "And that\u2019s absolutely fair, but in that scenario you set the expectations for the day early on, you both insist everything is cancelled and you make sure you\u2019re both on the same page. What you don\u2019t do is play \u201crelationship chicken\u201d like the op did. If the boyfriend doesn\u2019t know the stuff you\u2019ve just mentioned then it\u2019s not hard to see why he\u2019s come to the conclusion that it\u2019s nothing to be worried about at this stage.\n\nAgain, this is not absolving the bf at all, he should be able to sort out his priorities all by himself, but op needs to work on her communication too. You can\u2019t gamble that your partner is 100% on your wavelength when it comes to things like this, especially when you haven\u2019t know each other all that long.", "Yes, in a perfect world, he should want to be near her if he's worried about the pregnancy - likewise, if SHE was worried about the pregnancy, SHE would actively be communicating that with him instead of laying a trap to see if he'll do what she wants him to do.\n\nWhat makes her the AH here is NOT doing that.\n\nAnd as for me - when my wife was in the midst of her extremely high-risk pregnancy with our son, I was available to her as much as I could possibly manage. That being said - in the hypothetical instance of \"losing my partner and unborn child while I was out watching football\" - I flat out would not have been in a relationship in the first place with a woman that chose being passive aggressive and use ridiculous traps instead of communicating with me and then accusing me of not caring about her or the baby for falling into the trap she set.", "To be fair, the fact that she wasn\u2019t freaking out and was feigning \u201ceverything is fine\u201d for a few hours probably signaled to him \u201coh, it\u2019s fine. She\u2019s the mother, she has the experience. If she thinks it\u2019s fine it\u2019s fine\u201d. \n\nThis is why proper communication is important. Nobody wins with passive aggressive games. It\u2019s only losers.", "YTA - For not communicating better. He literally went off of what you said, and gauged that there wasn't an urgency from your communication. The guy cancelled as soon as you revealed your thoughts.\n\nYour above reply is concerning though, the idea of becoming a dad, and actually being a dad is so different. You can have an idea of something and make it as magical, cute and horrible as you want, but reality will always bite you in the a$$. He needs to be fully prepared that he can't just go and watch football whenever he wants when the baby arrives, or hang out with his buddies whenever he wants, he needs to be prepared and more.\n\nYou saying that he's mainly the one who wanted to have a child.....what do you want?", "Yeah, being over an hour away when there is a potential for an emergency is not a great idea, and makes it even more scary for you being alone.", "You were totally trying to manipulate him into doing what you wanted by attempting to guilt him and make him seem like a bad partner and father because he didn't drop his plans on the small off chance you might need him. \n\nDo you not drive? Is there any reason you couldn't get yourself to a doctor on the off chance something actually did happen?", "Then you should have told him you were scared and asked him to stay. Your words made it seem like you weren't really worried", "How will you be able to take your kid to the hospital by yourself when an emergency hits for them and say the boyfriend is working? Delaying treatment even for a broken arm isn\u2019t a good idea..", "Why won\u2019t you go to the hospital by yourself? Are you going to wait for your boyfriend to come home if your kid breaks it\u2019s arm in the morning?", "What if you child needs to go to the hospital!? OP please do not have a child until you are in a mentally sound place where you have the ability to take care of a child", "You need to communicate what you want better. You wanted him to stay with you, you should have said that.", "You're both too young to be having kids and it's hardly fair to any future children to have immature parents who likely are not finished with education or well established in careers. Please please get on birth control and put this off until both of you mature a bit, and explore if you should even be together because from here it's not looking good.\n\nYou either don't or cannot communicate effectively, and resort to ultimatums, and he thinks nothing of larking off during a possible crisis to 90 minutes away. Neither of you are right in this ESH", "Absolutely agree. This is definitely an ESH situation.", "Agreed, it\u2019s clearly ESH.", "I wasnt sure until i was pregnant, and after i lost it i was heartbroken, which i think is the main reason why we got pregnant again, it wasn\u2019t like we was actively trying, it was just if it happened then it happened kind of thing.", "It definitely wasnt meant as a manipulation but im starting to realise how it could be seen that way. There are other things that were said and things in the past that influenced how i reacted however none of that really changes what i said and what he said, which is why i didnt include them.", "Are you seriously expecting a woman who may be miscarrying to drive herself to the hospital? What a daft idea. People in physical and emotional pain should not be driving cars!", "I have a lot of family support close by, however as i said this is something i am working on which is why i didnt include it in the post as its not an excuse.", "I have anxiety which ive had for years, it basically means i dont go anywhere without someone, because i end up having panic attacks, and because i pretty much never leave the house alone its gotten worse\u2026 its something i am getting better at but right now its still something i struggle with.", "That's fair. I've updated my post.", "There\u2019s no such thing as \u2018not trying\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s using birth control or not.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t using birth control then you\u2019re trying to get pregnant.", "I don't think either of you sound mature enough to have a child from the rest of your comments about your relationship together.", "So he is supposed to stay with her the entire pregnancy? What if he was at work? Or he had an emergency?", "You think the fear of that will be alleviated in less than 9 months? \n\nBut as a person who had my parents in the ER more times than I really want to admit to for broken bones, or my heart condition, there were times that all of our support system were not immediately available and one of my parents had to be alone for the first part of my hospital visits. \n\nThis needs to be a first priority thing to work on with a therapist on top of the poor communication you and your boyfriend seem to have going on.", "If you can't properly take care of yourself, what makes you think you can care for a baby?", "You\u2019ve gotten pregnant twice with a man you\u2019ve been with a year but can\u2019t go anywhere alone, this is the problem. I don\u2019t mean to sound harsh but you need to get professional help and fix that before you get into a relationship and have a child. Your bf is not the problem", "She literally had a bleed this morning, after having a miscarriage earlier in the year. Yes he should be staying with her today. Not getting on a train to travel an hour and a half away to watch football.", "I understand that perspective, however i think people with mental health can still live their lives like the average person? As long as i can provide a safe, healthy and loving environment for a child, and can give them what they need despite having mental health, does that mean I shouldn\u2019t become a mother?", "And she couldn't handle it like an adult? Manipulating someone like that is not OK.", "Objectively it would have been better for OP to communicate her fears and expectations directly to her partner, but expecting someone who is very emotional - possibly traumatised by the miscarriage earlier this year - to act 100% rationally when it may be happening again is not actually reasonable, even for an Internet stranger. \n\nShe needed her partner home today, and honestly, if he had a bit more cop on she wouldn't have had to \"manipulate\" him (point out the truth that his actions reflect how he feels about the situation) in the first place.\n\nThey need to work on improving their communication, but that makes them fairly typical adults, I would think, judging by this forum anyway."]}
