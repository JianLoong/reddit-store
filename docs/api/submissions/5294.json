It was unexpected but we were both happy about it, until a week or so later there was blood and I ended up having a miscarriage.\n\nFast forward to today and I\u2019m now about 11 weeks pregnant with our second pregnancy and have my first scan next week. However this morning I woke up and found some blood, not loads but not a tiny amount either. I spoke to him about it and i said if theres anymore we need to go to the hospital so they can do a scan. He was supposed to go out to watch the football later and i assumed when i said that we may need to go to the hospital that he would cancel. Unfortunately my assumptions were incorrect and he still wanted to go. I got upset and initially didn\u2019t say anything about it but when he kept asking what was wrong i eventually told him \u2018i didn\u2019t want to tell him what to do or if he should go out or not, but what he decides will show how he feels about the situation.\u2019 He then said \u2018so you\u2019re saying i don\u2019t care about you or my child? nice\u2019 and he then told his mate he cant go out which made me feel like i\u2019m the one thats banned him or something.\n\nI understand people react differently in different situations, and maybe i shouldn\u2019t of given him an ultimatum as i know he does care, but seeing as though we\u2019ve been through this already before i thought he would understand me worrying about having to go to the hospital and he would want to be there instead of going out. AITA?\n\nEdit : Not that it makes a difference but in case anyone was wondering Im 21 and my boyfriend is 23.\n\nEdit 2 : I understand im the AH for how i handled it and what i said, i have since apologised to him and i understand that i really shouldn\u2019t have said what i said. For those saying i should have just gone to the hospital at the first sign of blood, the wait times are ridiculous where i live in a&e (i live in the uk) and most times they wont do much unless you\u2019ve lost a lot more blood. Last time i called an ambulance and they said its a \u2018simple miscarriage\u2019 and that was that.\nSecondly i understand and appreciate everyones opinions on whether or not me and my partner should have a child, but i don\u2019t think thats warranted. People can choose at what age they feel as though they can raise a child, im no stranger to children and appreciate how difficult it can be, yes i know having your own child is different. However these difficulties can be at any age as only when you have a child you will know exactly what its like.\nBoth me and my partner want this pregnancy, he has also been through a miscarriage in his last relationship which did affect him a lot. I wasnt sure i wanted children until i was pregnant, and due to person reasons which i wont state, that is why i am still pregnant. My boyfriend is also the only person i have not used birth control with, if thats relevant.", "created_utc": 1671633190, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zro842/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_if_he_goes_out_he/", "score": 352, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then you expected him to pre-cancel his plans just in case?\n\nYou had blood before a miscarriage in your first pregnancy, but even with that knowledge, the sight of blood this time STILL didn't ring alarm bells enough for YOU to want to immediately go to the hospital, so why should he be more worried about it than you are?\n\nIf you wanted him to cancel his plans and stay with you, I understand, but you didn't tell him that.

Esh for all this childish stuff", "I am so sorry for your loss.  This is a difficult situation.\n\nThe baby's health is DEFINITELY more important than a sports game on tv, and you are NTA for being upset, because he didn't seem very concerned about the health issues you are having.  IT'S SCARY!!!  Your partner should definitely be there, especially since you've already been through this one time.  I am thinking the surprise first pregnancy maybe wasn't as welcome to him as it was to you and therefore the loss of it didn't affect him as deeply, men don't get the physical connection with a life growing in their body, so they don't \"get it\" sometimes.  It's emotionally taxing just being pregnant, let alone miscarrying.  Hormones, physical changes and our shoes not fitting can make us kind of a big ol' mess, I really didn't like being pregnant, I LOVED knowing a baby was coming, just not the discomfort.  But men don't get that connection like women do, so there may sometimes be a disconnect for his emotions and concerns...plus, it's also scary for him too, and guys don't really do too well with \"scary health things\" for the most part.  Some do, but most men that I've known are not great with that stuff.  That's okay, we just deal with stuff differently.  He may have been worried but not known how to deal with it.  Guys can be weird. (They think women can be weird, so it all evens out. LOL)\n\nNow, I have a difficult question for you:  Was **he** really prepared to be pregnant with you?  Maybe he hadn't considered it happening in \"his timeline\" yet.  **HAVE A CONVERSATION with him.**  Ask him what his timeline for milestone events is.  When does he expect to get married, buy a house, have kids -too late-, retire...ALL OF THE THINGS that you do when you plan a life.  He may or may not have a plan, and that may not be a problem if you're under 27, but if you are approaching 30 or older, then y'all need to have plans.  Even if you don't manage to have everything planned out, at least get some of the important things like kids and marriage timelines down somewhat.  He may be feeling pressured because you've been together a year and to him that isn't enough time, while for you it may be plenty.  Again, HAVE A CONVERSATION.\n\nFrom your post, it sounds like you two may not really be on the same page when it comes to this relationship or parenthood.  I would advise that you both need to seriously consider if this is the PARTNER you want to share your LIFE WITH, or at least the next twenty years.  Can you see yourself with this person?  Can you be their PARTNER, not a doormat, and not a controlling crazy person in a tug of war with someone who is just not suited well to a relationship with YOU.  **There is no right and wrong in realizing you are not suited** for a long term partnership with someone, it just means you are not suited for EACH OTHER.  While a specific person may make life with you miserable, they could make someone else perfectly happy.\n\nBeing pregnant makes you especially emotional and vulnerable, **so please be kind to yourself**.  I know these are hard conversations to have, but it really needs to be done in order for you to move forward in parenthood and this relationship.  I hope this works out for you.  I hope you and baby stay healthy.  I also hope you and boyfriend can have some talks and find out how well you two really are suited for each other.  Don't expect to have the talks ALL AT THE SAME TIME, space out the conversations because heavy stuff can SOMETIMES turn off a guy's brain after about thirty minutes, so be patient, but definitely have those conversations.", "ESH but mostly you. If you wanted him to cancel, you should have just asked. You manipulated him to get your way by telling him that if he goes out, you'll know he doesn't love you or your child.

I will never understand why some women seem to think they suddenly become absolutely helpless when they are pregnant. You can't pick up a phone and call him **if** you ended up needing him?", "NTA but do you really want to have a child with someone you have only known a year who doesn\u2019t automatically consider your health a priority? That is a good way to end up stuck dealing with the dude for the next 18 years one way or another.", "YTA - don\u2019t make assumptions, don\u2019t punish your partner by pouting and being silently angry.

Yes, he *absolutely* should have offered to go with you, given the severity of the concern.\n\nBut him being a little insensitive about going with you (because he can't *treat* you, he would only be present for moral support) was then met with 1. you not communicating 2. you then implying he doesn't care about your pregnancy - that's a bit much.", "ESH\n\nThere is a breakdown of communication on both sides.\n\n1) Something that could become a serious consequence following already suffering through a miscarriage should be taken more seriously by your boyfriend. You need to ask if this is the person you feel is ready to be a father with a lifelong connection to you through a child.\n\n2) You need to learn how to really speak up for yourself instead of giving the silent treatment at first.

A&E and especially calling 999 are not appropriate for a possible or early miscarriage and I wanted to share with you where you can find the right help. \n\nCall an ambulance only if someone is in danger of dying before they can get to the hospital, or if it\u2019s physically impossible to get them to the hospital safely. Heart attack, very badly broken limbs, very heavy bleeding (pouring/gushing, not oozing/dripping), possible serious back, neck or head injury. Going into labour so quickly that you can\u2019t get to a hospital. Things where you need highly trained medical help right now, right where you are. \n\nGo to A&E if you need medical help immediately to deal with a new problem which is or could deteriorate to become a threat to life or limb. Broken arm, bleeding which won\u2019t stop, symptoms of sepsis, stroke, heart attack, vomiting absolutely everything to the point you are dehydrated. (Obviously lower threshold in little kids and particularly in infants - I\u2019m talking adults.) For less urgent stuff, use 111, your GP, and walk-in centres. \n\nFor a possible miscarriage or anything of that nature, you don\u2019t need an ambulance (unless you\u2019re literally bleeding to death), and if you show up at A&E they\u2019ll only send you to gynaecology, or have you book an appointment with the Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit if your town has one. If you have a women\u2019s hospital, they usually have an emergency gynae service with a phone number, often 24 hour with a nurse to talk to at the other end - try Googling for early pregnancy assessment unit and wherever you live. There are 200 in the UK so nobody is too far from one. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. That's a scary situation for any woman, even more so becs you've already been.rhrough the loss once.

If I were in that position, my gf's first pregnancy had ended with surprise blood and a miscarriage and then during the second pregnancy she woke up and found blood, i'd be advocating for immediately getting out of bed and going to the hospital.

Obviously, it will depend on where you are in the country, but chances are there will be an EPU you can attend at a nearby hospital.

If not, look it up and if you can't get hold of your midwife, please call them and ask their advice. Don't let someone tell you what to do and just believe it, you are allowed second opinions and to ask advice. Nothing is a silly question ok\ud83d\ude0a", "Exactly! It\u2019s crazy they\u2019re judging you on your maturity without actually knowing you as a person. And yeh I guess you\u2019re right they can say what they like but it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right. I\u2019m glad you haven\u2019t taken their maturity comments to heart.", "You did, thank you.", "I'm sorry, I don't mean to be insensitive to your current situation as I know it's hard (although you were YTA in the way you handled things). But I would like you to think about this - your partner lied to you about an allergy in an attempt to trick you into unprotected sex. And you stayed with them. And had unprotected sex. Then got pregnant. Then had a really rough time losing the pregnancy. And then while you were a hormonal mess and upset your partner had more unprotected sex with you despite the very obvious risk of the same thing happening again. \n\nOnce you know what's going on with this pregnancy and your a little less stressed, please *please* take a step back and think about whether or not your even in a healthy relationship. Because every detail you've given about your relationship tells me it's not. And regardless of whether or not this person is going to be in your life for the rest of your life because you have a child together, I don't think it's worth being with them. They put their own pleasure above your safety  (because pregnancy is dangerous) and your emotional wellbeing. And it's only been a year. It's not going to get better.", "Could he have communicated any of this? Yes. Hence the ESH. That\u2019s what I mean by jumping through hoops- instead of just taking it at face value, you\u2019re coming up with possible diagnoses to explain his behavior. Yeah, sure he could\u2019ve been having a panic attack. Mental illness isn\u2019t an excuse though for wanting to dip on your potentially miscarrying partner for a extended sporting outing. And it doesn\u2019t rid you of the responsibility to communicate. \n\nLiterally how hard would it have been to say \u201cHey, do you want me to stay in case you go to the hospital?\u201d Even if he was thinking about it (which you\u2019re right I\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t, which is bad of me), he didn\u2019t actually communicate those thoughts. Just like the OP. Therefore ESH.\n\nHow can I explain this better? Really not trying to fight with you but I don\u2019t understand how the logic of ESH versus YTA for this case is being lost in translation.", "I agree with your last statement, but yeah my point was definitely that \u201cI might have to go to the hospital\u201d *should* be concerning enough to scrap really involved plans. \n\nIf he had planned to be at a friends house 5 mins away, I actually wouldn\u2019t have said any of this because the likelihood is that he could\u2019ve rushed to the hospital had she needed him. But 1.5 away by train to see a live game is a bad idea if your partner might need to seek medical assistance. \n\nIn college, I had guy friends that were more concerned for my health and safety than I was. Maybe I\u2019m just spoiled by knowing and being friends with genuinely great guys but I do tend to side eye the \u201chow can you expect a guy to know anything about womens health?!\u201d type stuff because of it. And that might be my bias in these answers to be fair.", "Animal's lives aren't these little worthless things.  If the term is good enough for an animal, it's good enough for humans.  Otherwise, stop using it for animals.", "Not possible, the staff aren't there, they're on strike. My grandmother went to A&E a few months ago when there was no strike (ie business as usual) and having alzheimers and being 84 did not move her up the 20 hour overnight queue, without food or drink.", "That's the whole point, though.  By \"taking things at face value,\" you are acting as though you have a clue about what was going through his head.  We don't know.  I'm not willing to judge someone without having more to go on other than \"he didn't offer to stay.\"\n\nCould he have asked?  Sure.  But, in my estimation, we don't have nearly enough information about him, his actions, his thoughts, or his words to judge him.  Maybe you feel comfortable doing so, but I don't.\n\nI'm going to stick to judging the person we *do* have enough info about, the OP.", "I did go to him straight away and showed him a photo of the blood, and told him \u2018we\u2019 might have to go to the hospital if theres anymore, and he did acknowledge that and i was somewhat crying but i dont cry often, what i didnt do was communicate i didnt expect him to go out, it was a hour or so later that he was still making the plans and I got upset, which was then when he was asking me what was wrong and i eventually had that conversation with him. If all of that makes sense?", "Hi OP, just a suggestion if you are worried, you could probably give your midwife or a duty midwife a call (they may have given you a set of numbers when you had your 8 week appointment - they did for me when I had my 8 week appointment). They may be able to arrange a scan to see what is going on. (A GP arranged this for me when I had a miscarriage at 8 weeks because I hadn't had my 8 week midwife appointment yet for that pregnancy so went through them). Might set your mind at rest. Hope it all works out for you, I know how awful it can be.", "No offense intended, but in this specific scenario I don't think an 84-year-old with Alzheimer's is as big of an emergency as a child that is potentially on the verge of dying.", "It's all completely relevant to the whole situation. You are having a BABY. You are bringing another human being into this world. This isn't getting a new car or new phone. This is a whole ass human being who you can mess up with your inability to leave the house and your poor relationship. You honestly need to fix your ponytail and get to work because this human is going to be here before you know it and none of these issues are going to magically fix themselves", "Okay, that\u2019s pretty fair although I would argue that we have the ESH/NAH for a reason- it can often be impossible to judge one person in a scenario without judging the other. I *do* judge this man for failing to even ask, and you don\u2019t! Completely fair disagreement, and I do hope you\u2019re having a good day! \n\nI apologize for my part in getting all riled up", "It makes sense and I'm definitely not saying you're the asshole but I am saying that you're not going to be able to rely on this person. Expecting to be able to force it is going to be an extremely stressful situation", "Forgot to say I am also UK and my bleeding was also not bad enough to justify A and E. My scan was in the early pregnancy unit so a bit different to the scans you get later on.", "You're missing the point. On a good day there's a 20 hour wait, and leaving a frail woman without food and drink overnight for 20 hours is normal. Today, the day of a strike, this poor woman experiencing a miscarriage will not get the help she needs - they cannot move her up the queue, the staff are not there. Also, unless her life is in danger, A&E won't see her at all, the bleeding has to be a haemorrhage. Miscarriage is not seen as a medical emergency, at this stage in pregnancy it will just be seen as one of those things. Again, this is a strike day. I experienced the \"wait and see\" on a normal day."]}
