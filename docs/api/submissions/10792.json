I run into her from time to time and we talk.\n\nJane is insanely smart. Insanely. She got into two Ivy schools but she couldn't go and leave her family behind. She has an older sister and 4 younger siblings. Her dad goes in and out of their family as he wishes, and her mom cares for them but doesn't do much herself. Her sister works full time and she has a younger brother in trade school. Jane went to state school for a while but dropped out so she could also work full time.\n\nAt one point I asked her if she enjoyed what she does, and she was very direct, saying she hates her life but does it because she loves her family and wants to provide for them.\n\nA few weeks ago I asked Jane if she would want to go back to school. She said that's not possible because she already dropped out once and she can't pay for it. Dropping out isn't a big deal, plenty of people do and go back later. There's also financial aid available and I know people who could arrange something for her.\n\nI have a friend working in a company that in Jane's field of study. If she keeps her grades up, she could get an internship there and then go into bigger positions at bigger companies. \n\nI asked her if she'd like to do this, because I think she has a lot of potential that's being suppressed. If she chose not to though that's also completely her choice.\n\nJane said she couldn't because she had to work. Her sister was also planning to get married to her boyfriend and move away, so she (Jane) would need to stay close by to pick up her siblings from school and things. I suggested that she pick up a casual job (fast food, etc) to do alongside her studies, like many students do. She won't be earning as much as she does now, but she'll be studying which is the bigger goal. There's also school buses and other options for her siblings if she can't make it. She said she'd think about it.\n\nLast week, Jane told me she wants to go back to school and finish her studies. \n\nSo yesterday I got a call from Jane's older sister. She went off at me saying I put all these ideas into Jane's head and made her think she's hot stuff. That it's not my place and I didn't need to stick my head into other people's business. This went on for a while.\n\nNow I'm thinking if I really went too far?

So sister doesn't help, but thinks Jane should revolve her life 100% around helping??\n\nJane didn't get all these kids. Jane is not responsible for raising her siblings.

I realised it because her kids were evidently *brilliant*. I got her in touch with my neighbour, a teacher at a good private school, who got her kids tested: TLDR they got scholarships to the best school in town. And that gave the cleaner confidence in herself, so she trained and became a book-keeper.  \n\nYou did good. \n\nNTA", "So the sister gets to move on with her life but Jane doesn\u2019t?

There are other options for all the \u2018issues\u2019 and it isn\u2019t Jane\u2019s responsibility to be raising her siblings and bringing in a full time income for her entire family. Her parents are taking advantage of her. Good for you for encouraging her to pursue more, and go after the life she deserves. I hope that she can follow through even with all the negativity, but having someone positive in her life must be eye-opening for her.", "NTA Jane needs to get out of that situation ASAP. And she's likely to need all the encouragement she can get to pursue what makes her happy.  I'd encourage her to find other people to stay with and consider limiting contact with what sound like very toxic family members. It's not her responsibility to support her entire family.  She should be planning for HER future.", "NTA thank you for doing this! You may have just changed that woman's entire life trajectory", "NTA everything you said is true.

If your idea was truly terrible, she would not have followed it. Jane's sister has no say into what 2 autonomous adults should talk about.\n\nOn the plus side, this investment Jane is making for herself may also exponentially improve her financial situation in the future which would allow her to more easily provide for a more comfortable life for her siblings if she chooses to.\n\nHowever, I do feel pity for Jane's sister's situation. If this came suddenly out of the blue, she would now have to scramble and somehow put together a new plan to ensure the wellbeing of her siblings.\n\nBoth Jane and her sister are making longer term investments. Jane is going into education, while her sister is going into marriage. These women should have the freedom to pursue those paths without the burden of caring for their 4 siblings. Either way, the responsibility of Jane's siblings if they're minors should always be their parents. So if anyone's the AH here it's them.", "NTA\n\nBut...\n\nAs someone who is studying to go into the healthcare/mental health profession, we are seeing a lot of concern around cultural identity. We are being made aware that values change not only from culture to culture but even family to family.\n\nWe in North America/the West, place a high value on individualism and self-empowerment. Other cultures place a high value on the collective, family, duty.\n\nMy training is creating a sensitivity in me to realize that what helps one person might not help another. Or, put another way, what I think is helpful in my context/culture may not be viewed or received as helpful in another context/culture.\n\nSo no, you're not an asshole according to my definitions of care and compassion and human autonomy and success and ambition - but I can absolutely understand that other cultures and even other families have their own relevant, valid definitions of compassion and human autonomy and success and ambition that would make your participation in Jane's life an affront.\n\nJane hates her life - that's a big deal, right? Just know that there are as many ways to fix that as there are to make that worse and as the saying goes \"the road to hell is paved with good intentions.\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
