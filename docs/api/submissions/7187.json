I(47F) have a son \"Jack\"(24m)who was dating \"Neil\"(24m) They lived together until recently. Neil and I get along pretty well and a few weeks ago we were on the phone, talking about food and it leads to Neil talking about how concerned he is about the food he gets and brings home, what with Jack's peanut allergy. This really confused be because Jack does not have a peanut allergy, at all. He grew up eating peanuts, pb&j reeses you name it without issue, and I know he's had it as an adult too. I told Neil that Jack has no such allergy and he didn't believe me, and the conversation changed because I think we both felt kind of awkward. I had spoken to Jack about this too and he claimed that he must have gotten later in life, I asked if he has actually had a reaction and what the symptoms were and he clammed up.\n\nOver the holidays I made a cake(I bake for a living) as I always do and Jack and Neil were there. I had reeses in it and did not say anything. Guess who had a bunch, loved it, and had no reaction whatsoever? Jack. I didn't say anything then because I didn't want to cause any drama over the holidays(I know how bad that probably sounds if he DID have a reaction, but I knew with 100% certainty he wouldn't) but texted him the other day that the cake had Reeses in it, and that he clearly was fine so there is no peanut allergy. Later Neil is texting me furious and called me an AH from the ER saying that Jack had a reaction after I texted him, and I explained to him that this is not how allergies fucking work! He had that cake over two weeks ago and only reacted when he knew what was in it. Finally it clicked in Neil's head and the doctor confirmed there was literally nothing wrong with Jack at all. Jack and Neil got in a massive fight over this, there's now a $900 ER bill to pay and Neil is not paying it and he moved out. Jack is still insisting he is allergic and has called me an AH and that I destroyed his relationship. I told him he should not have lied but screamed over the phone that he is not lying. \n\nWas it wrong of me to do this? I thought I was just trying to make a point and prove that he was lying to his partner but I really did not think things would go so out of hand.

For playing with your sons life just to prove a stupid point.", "Yes it was wrong of you. \n\nYour son is an adult. Apparently he is also lying about having an allergy for some weird reason of his own, but this is no longer your business. \n\nIf you felt you had to address this, you should have brought it alone with your son, with a spirit of inquiry, not accusation. He has SOME reason for doing this, even if it\u2019s a crazy or manipulative reason. He may be having mental health issues, he may be seriously hypochondriac, he may be emotionally fragile and this is how he gets loving attention. I dunno - but in ANY case once you\u2019ve expressed your concern to him it ceases to be your business. \n\nInstead of doing that, you chose the most confrontational way possible to show him up and expose him. That was uncalled for   and cruel. \n\nIt could also have been dangerous. Allergies are weird, not fully understood, and can develop suddenly later in life. They can also disappear. One of my children is allergic to shrimp and sometimes she has a severe reaction and sometimes nothing at all.

The odds of him choking on the cake were probably higher.\n\nIf it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, swims like a duck, has feathers like a duck, and lays eggs like a duck, the odds of it turning out to be a lion are infinitesimal.\n\nIf the two weeks delayed reaction he had caused actual symptoms, then he urgently needs to see both a doctor and a psychiatrist.

Jack knew he was lying about the allergy and consciously decided to double down on that lie when called out and fake a reaction.

I was about 17 at the time & me and a few buddies went to Denny's at 3am, each and every one of us incredibly stoned (which should be a given for 3am Dennys.) One of my close friends ordered peanut butter pancakes. \n\nNow I'm not airborne or anything, but being around it would make me anxious as my allergy is life-threatening. When the food was served I tried my best to ignore it but after a few moments i started to feel like my throat was closing up.\n\nI immediately went to the Denny's bathroom and began to rip off my clothes to look for any signs of hives, fortunately none was there. After a few moments one of my friends did come to check up on me.\n\neventually I relaxed and felt better, we all left. It was only later did I realize it was a panic attack.", "The son is a moron and the relationship failing was his fault. Usually testing if someone *actually* has a food allergy isn't looked at too fondly.", "Oh, that would make so much more sense. Yeah, it seems far more likely that he just didn't brush his teeth after vs him having peanut dick.\n\nI kind of like my explanation more though. It's funnier to picture.", "I didn\u2019t really ask. He came to my room naked and freaking out because she wasn\u2019t responding the way she should have after the pen. We called 911 and talked to her until they arrived, then he got dressed and we went to the hospital. All good in the end! Scary at the time though.", "I was thinking he ate it, touched his dick, washed his hands and mouth knowing about her allergy, but didn't think to scrub his junk too.", "He also likely could have not washed his hands after eating and touched himself with them before she gave him head.", "This. Also, people don't seem to realize that a peanut allergy is NOT a nut allergy, peanuts are legumes.", "Do you just keep quiet when this happens? Do you just eat whatever your mom gives you? Or do you remind her when she gives you the oil or ask her the ingredients in any of her food to double check no nuts made it in?", "OP literally starts the post by saying she was on the phone with her son's S/O, who she gets along with, and then goes on to say she had them over to eat cake (like always) for the holidays, lol.", "thank you for the advice (: i shall. i\u2019ve been allergic to blackberries since i was a kid but only within the last two years has the allergy spread to other fruits", "I mean, yeah I guess that\u2019s true. Regardless of that, he clearly doesn\u2019t eat peanut products at home, but had a reaction delayed by 2 weeks after eater peanut butter at his mom\u2019s? Immediately after finding out he had eaten said peanut butter? No. Dude is literally just lying lmao there\u2019s not really much denying it.", "And he didn\u2019t bring up this hypothetical test because?", "If he'd shown peanut allergy on an allergen test he would have been prescribed an epipen even if he'd only ever had mild reactions. \nHe could show his mom or boyfriend the epipen to prove his allergy", "Allergies can develop at any point. I taught a kid who had eaten peanuts her whole life, then went into anaphylaxis at a soccer game when she was 12, now she has to carry an epi pen everywhere. My brother grew up in a house full of cats and dogs with no issues. Nowadays it takes about 15 minutes in a house with pets to turn him into a ball of snot. \n\nI'm glad that OPs test panned out the way she wanted and she didn't accidentally kill her child, but he absolutely could have developed this allergy as an adult.", "Apparently one can develop peanut allergies after adulthood. https://www.healthline.com/health-news/adults-are-developing-peanut-allergies-after-age-18-heres-what-we-know", "OP assumed. OP DID NOT KNOW. It is totally possible for adults to develop allergies.", "I have two friends who developed nut allergies later in life - one friend in high school and another in college. It happens.", "She doesn't \"know\" he doesn't have one. She knows he didn't have one growing up perhaps. Despite eating shellfish all the time as a child I developed a shellfish allergy in my early 20s. Nearly died from a cross contamination reaction in my early 30s. Didn't actually eat any just cross contamination nearly killed me. And I had eaten all types of shellfish as a kid.", "Clearly, she knows him better than we do.", "allergies can develop very suddenly at any time. you could be eating peanut butter just fine today and tomorrow you'll end up at the hospital because your mouth, your tongue, and your throat are swelling shut.", "Yeah, at the same time I also became very allergic to everything in the penicillin family. That\u2019s at least easier to avoid than my food allergies, but it\u2019s a problem when I need an antibiotic, some of the safe ones just don\u2019t work as well.", "But I also can\u2019t imagine lying to my partner when they\u2019re worried and probably spending twice as long or as much at the grocery store trying to prevent allergens for a fake allergy. We don\u2019t know how many steps their partner took to avoid said allergy like I can\u2019t imagine putting a partner through so much more work and stress over something that isn\u2019t real.", "I was thinking that maybe the son hates Thai food, or some other peanut heavy cuisine and that was the easiest excuse?", "I remember reading a story (might have been on reddit) about how someone always made some nasty food and instead of telling them they didn't like it, they lied about a peanut allergy and then just went with it for years or decades. \n\nIIRC they got busted eating peanut M&Ms years later.", "I don\u2019t think the answer would be very interesting sadly. People do often lie about allergies for foods they really really hate and don\u2019t want to face judgment/a grilling on, and I often say I\u2019m allergic to certain foods and then when the distinction is important clarify that I\u2019m in fact intolerant (although really really intolerant, it\u2019s just not life threatening as an allergy would be it\u2019s just miserable). However, to lie, including to your partner, about something as severe as a peanut allergy that means your partner worried about what food they bring in to the house, and going to the hospital I just can\u2019t see that there isn\u2019t a mental health issue here somewhere. It\u2019s maybe something to do with attention from the partner maybe.\n\nFor the judgement - ESH - even if you think you\u2019re so sure there\u2019s no way you could ever be wrong (and I admit it\u2019s especially fishy that this supposed severe allergy seemingly hadn\u2019t been communicated to mum - people with allergies of that severity have to let EVERYONE know to keep themselves safe) you just do not secretly test the validity of someone\u2019s allergy. Allergies can and do develop in later life and if OP had misjudged that she might not have a son still here to argue with at all. Jack is obviously an asshole for this bizarre and serious lie, although not knowing if he is mentally unwell leaves a large part of the puzzle missing.", "Not gonna lie, I despise peanut butter and growing up my mom made us pb&j sandwiches for lunch. Every. Day. Being the brilliant 5 year old I was, I would eat it, and immediately started scratching my arms to make it look like hives. Got me out of eating the sandwiches for 3 days while my mom waited for an appointment to get a blood test done. Had I known I was going to be poked with a needle I wouldn\u2019t have done it at all. I got in trouble for faking an allergy until I told her why. To this day I can\u2019t stand peanut butter, but I love peanuts.", "The parent clearly states that they know their son had no allergy though and alluded to having seen him consume peanut products in the time that he was claiming to have the allergy. I fully agree testing food allergies is major asshole move, but in this case where you have concrete proof and know it won't cause no issue then there's 0 issue in my book. Fuck people that fake food allergies.", "I just dont eat anything she makes. If i did eat something with nuts then i have anaphylatic reaction. They live over an hour to nearest hospital. I would not make it in time.", "Processed and cooked apples never bothered me, only raw, until I hit my teens. I can have some juices that have a little apple in there, but not carrots. It will cause my throat to close", "That could be a psychosomatic reaction profile.", "Assuming it never expired. They expire within one year sadly and are extremely expensive at least here in America. But yeah he couldve showed them that. Its so horrible to lie about allergies", "I feel like he should have mentioned it to mom since he at least occasionally eats at her house (if it was true).  Like oh by the way....", "My mum was 65 and developed an allergy to walnuts out of nowhere. It actually took a while to work out cause it was so random.", "My sister-in-law developed a nut allergy in her late 20s. She was sitting at home snacking on some cashews, as she often did, and suddenly felt her mouth and throat swelling up. She was home alone, so it's very lucky she acted quickly and called an ambulance, as I dread to think how badly that could have ended.", "Normally I'd agree, but OP says she's seen her son eat peanut products as an adult. She knew for certain he wasn't allergic.", "Ball of snot\u2026. No cutting onion eyes, spiders wearing scratchy wool socks in the back of the throat and elastic band round the chest\u2026? Your brother should at least do it properly come on this is amateur level! /s", "My dad was in his early 60s when he developed peanut and walnut allergies", "Like I replied to a few comments up, he couldn\u2019t even describe the symptoms of his \u201creactions\u201d lmao", "Exactly. I\u2019ve developed over a dozen food allergies. All as an adult.", "You missed the point of the question.", "No no, she TESTED his allergy two weeks ago, we have no idea the last time she witnessed him eating peanuts", "Allergies just like how gravity works in looney tunes./s", "Do you mean her telling him sent him into that response that made him feel he was having a reaction?", "I know. My 2 year old has a peanut allergy. \nEpipens are terribly expensive, but worth having in just in case", "Allergies have levels of severity, too. Not everyone has a severe peanut/nut allergy, or any allergy for that matter.   \nThere's usually a threshold before you go into anaphylaxis. \n\nI have latex-food syndrome due to a latex allergy that developed later in life (teen years)  and got worse after I was given COVID by my very irresponsible roommate at the time. I used to eat avocado, even if I had an allergy I could eat three small avocados without problems, and I snacked on guacamole anytime I could and finished a bow by myself with a bag of fritos. Now I can't do that, after the second avocado my mouth goes numb and I feel weird when breathing... it means my severity changed. Same with bananas and raw tomatoes.\n\nSo never judge someone who says they have an allergy, even if you're their parent. Just take it at face value, if they're lying eventually the truth will come out and then you're gonna have to see your therapy options because faking an illness is not okay.", "I developed a true allergy to aspirin and ibuprofen when I was about 30 years old.  It started with facial swelling and got worse with each exposure, until I realized what was causing it and saw a doctor.  OP was right, but she could have been wrong.  Catching her son this way was not really safe.", "There's no indication in the post of when \"as an adult\" was. Could have been years ago. Obviously her son's behavior was suspect, and I don't blame her for questioning the allergy, but to secretly test it was very stupid. The reward for being right just isn't worth the risk of being wrong here.", "I would be so sad!", "And? People are allowed to be private. Nobody is owed a description of anyone else's symptoms.", "Did you reply to the wrong comment?  Because what you said doesn\u2019t address their comment at all.  People can develop allergies in adulthood it\u2019s not constant.", "help me out? the question seems pointless overall given how random allergies can be.", "But OP also says the doctor proved there\u2019s nothing wrong, like maybe they did an allergy test", "Yes, that could be the case.  Also, your allergies only triggering sometimes could be the same thing.", "1000% agreed! I need to get another one. Sorry your kiddo has a peanut allergy - allergies are a pain!", "I developed an allergy to shrimp and crab at 34 after eating both allllllll the time. I\u2019m still sad about it", "He also wouldn't answer her when she asked him about it. Wouldn't even say what his symptoms were or how he found out. Tie that together with the eating it almost his entire life and it is pretty obvious it's a lie", "While I would agree when it comes to food allergies it is 100% safer to tell people your reactions to said food as if your allergy symptom is different then the commonly shown ones it can save that person\u2019s life because people will be more alert and looking for said reaction", "Maybe it's not the time to be discrete with someone who is preparing your food.   I have a food alergy.  But it's mild.  Itchy eyes is a whole different ballgame than anaphylaxis.", "Peanut allergies and their symptoms are hardly a secret. Everyone associates peanut allergies with epipens for a reason.", "But you need a reaction of some sort to find out that you developed an allergy or be tested for it. You don't just wake up one day and decide you are allergic.", "I don\u2019t think they do allergy tests at the ER lol. You go to an allergist for that. I think they meant that he wasn\u2019t having a reaction, which makes sense.", "Definitely a valid point. They trigger 100% of the time with certain allergies and not 100% with others. For me, I also wonder if it\u2019s because of exposure. All of the things I have diagnosed allergies to have never been severe enough allergies to where I can\u2019t be around/consume so I either own them or still eat them. If they cause reactions (itchy/watery eyes, itchy throat, hives), then I just take a Benadryl.", "Plus since he at least sometimes eats at moms house, you think he would have brought this up at some point.", "I also suspect that there was a pattern of behavior with Neil that caused OP to suspect he was lying, beyond knowing that he had peanut butter in the past without issue. If one of my kids, as an adult, came and told me they had developed a late-onset peanut allergy, my first reaction wouldn\u2019t be \u201cLIAR!\u201d\nSo, I bet there is some history that we aren\u2019t privy to.", ">and it is pretty obvious it's a lie\n\nYeah but you don't fuck with people's food even if they are liars. It's a consent violation and potentially (even if only slightly) dangerous.", "Yes, we should all attempt to murder our children when they're a little tight lipped about their medical issues.", "Sure, but it doesn't mean that if someone doesn't tell you their symptoms they don't have an allergy. Would it be smarter to tell? Yes. Is it irrefutable evidence that there is no allergy? No.", "Why does the person preparing the food need to know the symptoms? Shouldn't finding out about an allergy be enough to avoid cooking with it?", "Not all peanut allergies are the same. Some people can\u2019t be in a room that has a peanut in it without dying. Some people have sinus issues if touching one. Any allergy can cause a person to require an epipen.", "Some people don't even realize they're having an allergic reaction if they have a mild allergy because they expect to have anaphylaxis right away when it's not always the case.", "I mean they could have done a blood test\u2026 which is one of the pricier allergy tests.  $900 for an ER visit doesn\u2019t sound right either, it could have been an urgent care visit with blood test costs.", "he didn't ask what was in it, nor did he care, obviously.  Hell, she wouldn't even have known if it didn't come up in conversation with Neil.\n\nLike I know people with pretty severe food allergies and guess what they always ask and confirm what is in the food.", "Ah yes, the obvious being tight-lipped when your mother asks, Hey son, I heard you now have a potential fatal allergy to a very common food item. Just when/how did you find this out, and how severe is it?\nSeems like something someone would give a straight answer too especially family.", "My guy\u2026if you have a life threatening allergy you would be more careful then ops son, they would be asking if something has said food in it and would be telling people what to look for. Peanuts are a life threatening allergy and lying about that is incredibly worrisome", "I know that. I have a peanut allergy. And I know any grown and intelligent adult is aware that allergies can manifest in different ways and can give examples when asked.", "Anything is possible! I really don\u2019t think urgent cares do allergy tests of any kind though, you\u2019d still have to seek out an allergist or your PCM (at least where I\u2019m at). If you were to walk in somewhere and tell them you were having a reaction they\u2019d typically just believe that and treat the reaction. I, of course, have no clue what they did in this circumstance though, so you could be right."]}
