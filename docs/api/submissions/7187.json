I(47F) have a son \"Jack\"(24m)who was dating \"Neil\"(24m) They lived together until recently. Neil and I get along pretty well and a few weeks ago we were on the phone, talking about food and it leads to Neil talking about how concerned he is about the food he gets and brings home, what with Jack's peanut allergy. This really confused be because Jack does not have a peanut allergy, at all. He grew up eating peanuts, pb&j reeses you name it without issue, and I know he's had it as an adult too. I told Neil that Jack has no such allergy and he didn't believe me, and the conversation changed because I think we both felt kind of awkward. I had spoken to Jack about this too and he claimed that he must have gotten later in life, I asked if he has actually had a reaction and what the symptoms were and he clammed up.\n\nOver the holidays I made a cake(I bake for a living) as I always do and Jack and Neil were there. I had reeses in it and did not say anything. Guess who had a bunch, loved it, and had no reaction whatsoever? Jack. I didn't say anything then because I didn't want to cause any drama over the holidays(I know how bad that probably sounds if he DID have a reaction, but I knew with 100% certainty he wouldn't) but texted him the other day that the cake had Reeses in it, and that he clearly was fine so there is no peanut allergy. Later Neil is texting me furious and called me an AH from the ER saying that Jack had a reaction after I texted him, and I explained to him that this is not how allergies fucking work! He had that cake over two weeks ago and only reacted when he knew what was in it. Finally it clicked in Neil's head and the doctor confirmed there was literally nothing wrong with Jack at all. Jack and Neil got in a massive fight over this, there's now a $900 ER bill to pay and Neil is not paying it and he moved out. Jack is still insisting he is allergic and has called me an AH and that I destroyed his relationship. I told him he should not have lied but screamed over the phone that he is not lying. \n\nWas it wrong of me to do this? I thought I was just trying to make a point and prove that he was lying to his partner but I really did not think things would go so out of hand.

Which I\u2019m sure is a relief given the gamble you just took with his life to prove your point. But did it occur to you to maybe try talking or therapeutic intervention before lacing his food? \n\nFood sensitivities often come with embarrassing symptoms. A lot of people aren\u2019t going to be eager to discuss the explosive slime lump shits they get. Maybe he developed the sensitivity in response to the intense antibiotics from an STI or something. There\u2019s plenty of reasons why he might not want to talk about the details to his mother. And as a grown ass adult - no reason why he should have to. If you were so certain he wasn\u2019t allergic you could have had him go to an immunologist for a controlled exposure panel.

I grew up with dogs and was fine, but now I can't have one in the house because I have become allergic to the hair.  No idea why........\n\nWhatever lies he is telling his partner, for whatever reason, was none of your business.  You should have left it at the phone call - fairly, you didn't get a heads up that he was saying he had an allergy (real or not) so you answered honestly.  That is where it should have ended.  If you really had to take it up with him, you should have done that in private.", "*I thought I was just trying to make a point and prove that he was lying to his partner but I really did not think things would go so out of hand.*\n\nMay I ask what you thought would happen here? People are rarely pleased to learn that they've been lied to by their intimate partner. There's usually some sort of fallout, especially when the topic is life-or-death, which nut allergies can be. My college roommate had to use her epi-pen after going down on a guy who'd eaten Pad Thai earlier in their evening. This wasn't some white lie told to maintain a surprise party or something.\n\nESH except for Neil. Good for him getting out of this fake allergy-fake poisoning situation y'all have going on.", "ESH. But my mom is allergic to peanuts-except her reaction is an *extremely* upset stomach afterwards. Not your typical swelling reactions. So who knows. You shouldn't have gotten involved though. Jack is weird for lying (?)", "You\u2019re NTA I guess but I think your son needs to see a therapist STAT", "YTA. For playing with your sons life just to prove a stupid point.", "Yes it was wrong of you. \n\nYour son is an adult. Apparently he is also lying about having an allergy for some weird reason of his own, but this is no longer your business. \n\nIf you felt you had to address this, you should have brought it alone with your son, with a spirit of inquiry, not accusation. He has SOME reason for doing this, even if it\u2019s a crazy or manipulative reason. He may be having mental health issues, he may be seriously hypochondriac, he may be emotionally fragile and this is how he gets loving attention. I dunno - but in ANY case once you\u2019ve expressed your concern to him it ceases to be your business. \n\nInstead of doing that, you chose the most confrontational way possible to show him up and expose him. That was uncalled for   and cruel. \n\nIt could also have been dangerous. Allergies are weird, not fully understood, and can develop suddenly later in life. They can also disappear. One of my children is allergic to shrimp and sometimes she has a severe reaction and sometimes nothing at all.
