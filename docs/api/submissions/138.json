My MIL is under 60, so not elderly, but is reliant on others because she chooses not to drive.  She lives over an hour away from us so she visits every couple months and usually stays for several days at a time.  I don't enjoy her as a house guest.  She doesn't clean up after herself and has no regard for FIFO.  Long story short: her visits stress me out.\n\nLast night my husband and I were discussing inviting family to meet the baby when the time comes. I am due to have him around Thanksgiving, and we agree it's not appropriate to bring him to a big family gathering (40+ people) at just a few days old.  I was trying to come up with some options and mentioned that I had been considering ordering desserts and inviting people over after dinner to visit, have dessert and meet the baby.  We decided this wouldn't be realistic because the big gathering will be almost 2 hrs from our home.  He suggested we do something similar but wait until the weekend, when people will be available the whole day. Here's where we disagree. I don't want everyone descending on us at the same time for a whole day. I was hoping to keep the visits short-ish (2 hrs or so) and small.  Our home is big enough for our family but not to host a bunch of people. I mentioned to him that I want to avoid everyone coming all at once and he got really defensive. Insisting that his mother can't come alone, so of course she'd come with others and that his grandparents (in their 80s) don't like to drive at night, etc. I realize this and countered with MIL could plan to come with BIL or her long-time boyfriend, and allow her parents(who may come with others who are visiting from out of state for the holiday) to visit separately, in the afternoon. He deems this  unreasonable, that his family will all want to visit together.  I maintain that it's inconsiderate to visit the family of a newborn like this. He then gets upset, has an outburst of \"you just hate my family!\" And I feel like an AH. \n\nI don't hate his family, but they do overwhelm me. My family is smaller, my dad is the only one I expect to visit. When my daughter was born my in-laws came to visit twice in her first week, once at the hospital and once at home, and it was incredibly overwhelming for me and baby both times. Our daughter (4) can't wait to be a big sister. I'm hoping to involve her as much as possible so that she's not suddenly felt \"replaced\". I plan to breastfeed, but use bottles too, as that worked well for us before. I want my husband and daughter to share bottle feedings so she can participate in a way that she sees as helpful and special, and not have her \"job\" stolen by her grandmother. I may be overthinking it.\n\nIf I stick to my guns and insist that the in-laws break up their visits to 2-3 at a time and keep them short, AITA?", "created_utc": 1667222831, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yic6wh/aita_for_setting_boundaries_regarding_my_inlaws/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His mother doesn't drive so she will need someone to bring her, and she lives about an hour and a half from us. It would be easier for them if they all came together.

I don\u2019t think your husband truly realizes how stressful it is when his family visits bc he\u2019s not dealing with the issues (cleaning up and catering to his family). Sounds like you have shouldered the entire burden and not him. On top of which the transition between a parent of 1 to parenting 2 is big and it sounds like in the end you will be again shouldering the burden. He needs to see the additional mental and physical burdens his family is placing on you.

Stand your ground.", "NTA.

(I know it as First IN, First out, but I don't see how that applies).  Second, Another solution would be to rent a room/suite in the town where Thanksgiving is going to be held, and do the 'reception' there.  A suite because you could have a room for desserts AND a room for the new mother/baby to retire to for stress-free time.  Third, you don NOT need 2 hours to visit a mother and newborn, That isn't good for their health and will make everyone cranky.\n\nYou husband needs to respect YOUR WISHES!", "NTA but I think doing an open house style visit over/near the holiday weekend is a recipe for disaster. I can see why your husband is stressed because it is likely that people will want to come as a group rather than in broken up chunks -- especially if the larger gathering is a couple hours away. \n\nI would suggest that you invite people on specific days at specific times *outside* of the holiday window.", "NTA\n\nI'm not in a similar boat as you now, but I fear I may be. If I marry my current bf (which it seems very possible) and we have kids, I know his parents will be absolutely insane. I love them a lot. Sometimes they're more like parents to me than my own, especially his father. But they are the literal definition of helicopter parents with massive control issues. It's not like they cross boundaries on purpose necessarily, they just think they're doing what's right. Despite what everyone else tells them. I've already let my bf know that if we have kids and they get all uppity wanting to come over when they aren't wanted, they aren't allowed to have our house keys. He asked about my parents and I told them that if they respect our boundaries then they can have a spare key, but if they also don't respect them then they won't have a key. And I know it's years from now so we have only talked about it maybe once. But I wanted him to know how I felt before hand, because I know I'm completely justified in feeling this way because it's also my house that I pay half the mortgage on, my child that I just have birth to, and my right to say whether or not I want someone to have the keys when they'll just be over without being invited. \n\nTLDR is, everything is also yours. Your baby, your house, your situation. Not only is everything also yours, but you also just grew a child in your womb for 9 months and gave birth to a human. And all he did, for lack of better words, is just stand there. So if anything, you're 110% justified in standing your ground and setting these boundaries.

He can react poorly to that if he so chooses, but hold firm - you are absolutely well within your rights to set this boundary. \n\nYes, the baby is both of yours, but only one of you is going through a huge medical event to produce said baby (after growing the baby in your person for several months prior). If he can't see how this entitles you to some veto power beyond his, I don't know what to tell him.", "NTA. At the time of all the options you and your husband are discussing, your baby will still be days old. You will be exhausted and still adjusting to having a baby. That's not a good time to have everyone other at your home. What if you have a C-section? You could still be in the hospital during that weekend, and if not, you will be recovering from a massive surgery. The last thing you need is a bunch of people over asking you to do things for them. \n\nStand your ground, OP. Your husband is delusional thinking you are going to be able to host his entire family, nor should you be doing that.", "How big is his entire family that you know will come?", "NTA \n\nYour husband is not compromising at ALL, not even trying to listen or work something out with you. Also, he isn\u2019t the one who will have just pushed a bowling bowl out of his vagina, he isn\u2019t the one who deals with the fatigue and nausea, and he isn\u2019t the one who deals with breast feeding/pumping etc. \n\nHe is acting like a child, I would put your foot down, try and reason with him as best you can. Maybe build a PowerPoint of all the horrible side effects that come after birth to present to him!", "NTA- But you should also be cautious of how many people you have around your baby so close together and that baby being so little . In my part of the country it\u2019s RSV season and things can get really bad if a baby gets sick with it or any colds really. Your husband and his family need to be respectful of your boundaries, this is a time that you and your immediate family should be bonding instead of hosting other people. \n\nA child is not a trophy to be passed around.", "Set those boundaries and let your husband know you will not budge.  You are giving birth and there is no way you will be ready to host ANYONE for quite a few weeks after.  On top of that...germs!  Do you want a bunch of petri dishes traipsing through your door while baby is most vulnerable?  Short small visits or no visits at all until you recover.  NTA", "NTA and frankly since you are the one birthing this baby and will still be recovering your wishes come first", "NTA - not good to have a bunch of faces shoved in a newborns face. Also, are all these folks up to date with their shots. All they are going to do is pass the baby around and breathe on him/her. Not good.", "NTA. Set boundaries and stick to them.", "You're NTA, but having the whole family visit right after you give birth, even broken into chunks doesn't sound great. RSV is especially high this winter. I would delay the visit until after that weekend altogether, then invite individual people separately. No week long visits until baby is no longer a potato and you can run again.", "NTA\n\nYour Newborn your rules.", "I've never commented before but I wanted to on this. Newborns are susceptible to group B strep during the 1st 3 months.  It's normally contracted at birth, but they can still get it from people so it's not good to have them around crowds early on.  I went through this because my daughter had it and luckily we caught it early.  It can be fatal.  We were in the hospital for 12 days while she received treatment, a week after she was born.  The hospital staff kept asking me how we knew to bring her in because most people wait until it's too late.  Scariest days of my life!!  Do not feel bad about telling people no, and worrying about protecting your babies health!", "We are in the middle of not only a pandemic but an epidemic of a host of respiratory diseases.  PICUs are over flowing all over the country. Your baby will not have been immunized yet. You should not be having a bunch of people over at all. Wait until Easter.", "NTA\n\nSometimes I hate my culture then sometimes I see posts like this and I like my culture for a few seconds. In my culture extended family can't come to see the baby until after 40 days. Your close and immediate family come over to help around but that's all.In the first month, the mother isn't expected to do any chores. She just stays with the baby and recovers from the whole delivering process.Other people take turns doing chores and helping out but don't hang around the house or the baby unless the mother asks or needs a break to do her own thing.", "Nta", "NAH\n\nIf you want to be able to keep the meet and greet short though, I\u2019d recommend that you go to them meet part way somewhere.

I knew what it meant,  but didn\u2019t understand how it applied to anything \u201chome life\u201d related (we use it for money & investing) but thank you for your explanation cause now I get it and it fits perfectly.", "justnoso is a much more honest sub.  the mil sub doesn't give good feedback because they have a rule about \"always supporting OP\" even when OP is the problem.", "They should also have discussed what they would do when he breaks his arm on his 58th birthday before having any birthdays. It\u2019s just obvious. People never change and nor do situations. Learning from experience and planning when something actually happens are for suckers.", ">Yeah sit down, kiddo. The adults are talking.\n\nThat made me laugh so hard I snorted!!!!!", "That is why I said they should reach a compromise.  Maybe he can take baby to visit them while she rests.  Compromise is key.", "Funny you think I am the husband, I am actually a woman, and don\u2019t know these two from a hole in the ground.", "That sounds like a great compromise to me.", "Smart", "Take....a newborn.... to spend the day with the ILs away from the childs mother. That's your idea of a compromise.", "Can\u2019t take a breastfed newborn to visit an hour away, not without mom.  It\u2019s not feasible, nor safe.  Bottles typically don\u2019t get started that young, and they won\u2019t have a frozen supply built up, yet.", "It\u2019s one compromise, one, there are other ways to compromise.", "Maybe Mom just pumps enough for a a feed or two, or maybe mom and dad have a rational (gasp, what a concept) conversation and listen to each other and see what other compromises are possible.", "You can\u2019t take a newborn that is on a strict 3 hr eating schedule away from its food source. It also poops constantly and needs to sleep constantly. Also you can\u2019t have a newborn in a car seat for more than 2 hrs in a 24 hour time period.\n\nShit isn\u2019t so simple when a baby is under a month old.", "No, not for a baby a few days old. You pump for them if there are health issues, yes, but that is for the current feed when there are feeding issues.  You usually *cannot* pump enough for a couple of missed feeds for an outing at that age. You don\u2019t have the supply built up yet.  It\u2019s not communication, it\u2019s biology.   It\u2019s also irresponsible to be taking a week old baby to a big family gathering at under 2 weeks old.  The general recommendation is to keep the baby away from groups of people.    The mother and baby form a single unit, a dyad. You aren\u2019t supposed to separate them in the post partem period.  Decades of research show this.", "I'm so sorry you had to go through that! We had some scary moments with brochiolitis & RSV with my daughter, and are absolutely concerned about thst.  It is our main reason for not attending the Thanksgiving Day dinner being hosted by his family.  There are just too many people, and lots and lots of kids.  My comfort plays a role too, of course, but assuming I'm feeling well enough, we are opting out regardless, because there will just be too many germs for the little guy.\n\nLast year MIL showed up to Christmas with a \"little cold\", but didn't tell anyone, that turned out to be COVID, so I feel your pain/frustration there as well. I was so mad that she was so irresponsible, if we had known she wasn't feeling 100% I could have made the decision to stay home, or at least opted to mask.  Fortunately, my daughter somehow didn't get it it, but I was laid up over a week and I had to isolate away from my kid for 10 days which was really hard for both of us."]}
