A is 16 years old since last September and we have been living with each other since 2022 before me and my wife got married. Only recently however was when I began to notice how my step daughter acted around African American individuals, such as myself. A and my wife are both Caucasian and A was raised in a predominantly white neighborhood. I began to notice subtle things about A\u2019s behavior around my friends who are also black (specifically male), but she never shows the same behavior around those the same ethnicity as her. She constantly moves away from black people and goes through effort to be as far away from them as possible, even showing visible disgust on her face when she has to sit next to someone like me. Recently I confronted my wife about her behavior, and my wife said that when she was younger, A was apparently assulted by an African American man when she was walking home from school in the 8th grade. However, she also said that there were no visible injuries on A when she came home and that she walked home on a different route than she usually did; one specifically with no street view cameras. A had claimed to have been beaten by this man horrifically despite there being no bruises. Because of this, she PUBLICLY displays hatred towards me and my peers due to our skin color. I\u2019m not sure if the story is fake, but from what my wife told me there doesn\u2019t seem to be a way she was telling the truth.\n\nRecently when we were at a restaurant celebrating my wife\u2019s birthday, an African American man came up to serve us as our waiter. A looked horrified and desperately requested that we had our server changed because \u201che had a bad aura\u201d. However by this point I was frustrated by her constant disrespect of me and other African American people. I told her that if she wanted to ruin her mothers birthday with her racist attitude, she could get up and leave. A was FURIOUS about this and had a tantrum in the middle of the restaurant, screaming at me that I was a child abuser and that just because I\u2019m black doesn\u2019t mean I can \u201cshove it down her throat\u201d(?). After her meltdown she stormed off, and me and my wife packed the food we ordered and went back home. My wife thinks I was too harsh with her, but personally I completely believe that she had it coming. However, after thinking about it I\u2019m not sure if it was the best way I could have handled the situation.

If so, seems like a trauma response. She needs professional therapy to help her learn to feel safe again.", "You don't call people out in public, during your wife's birthday dinner. You just. Fucking. Don't. You ruined her birthday, not A. YTA for that.\n\nI'm holding off judging A because I have some serious concerns with the way you told her story. A 13/ 14 year old girl says she was assaulted, then she started behaving more fearful around people who share traits with her attacker. You don't mention anything about A getting to talk to the police or a therapist ***- someone who could've helped her if this happened - just that her mother never believed her. \n\nIt's pretty common for people to be attacked in areas where there aren't cameras, that's an intentional choice of the attacker, not an automatic dismissal of the victim. When trauma goes unaddressed, it not only doesn't go away, it can get worse. Not looking like you've been assaulted is also not necessarily evidence against  the claim.\n\nEighth graders don't just fabricate assaults for shits and giggles. Whether it's true or not, something is wrong here. You and your wife need to be taking this seriously and looking into what's going on with her.\n\n***or a doctor. If my kid came home saying they'd been horrifically beaten, I'd be taking them straight to the hospital. Doesn't fucking matter if I cant see any bruises.", "Info: Have you ever discussed this with A before or only with A\u2019s mom? If this was the first time you\u2019ve had a convo around her racism then I\u2019m leaning E S H because a sudden outburst is only going to affirm her bigoted beliefs and she\u2019s plenty old enough to know her racism is wrong. But if you\u2019ve discussed it with her before and she\u2019s continued to not improve her behavior then I\u2019d say N T A. Also is she in therapy?? Because whether the assault happened or not clearly she\u2019s got problems that need professional addressing.", "It's not racism it's trauma manifesting as racism.

Either way something is going with this young girl that was/is traumatic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe needs help.", "ESH. You are an AH for not believing she was assaulted. That is a very shitty thing. She sucks too because she is being racist (due to trauma, but racist nevertheless). You wife sucks too for not giving her the proper mental care she needs.", "ooooof. this is a horrible place to be, OP. I wanna say nta, because that must be awful to deal with, but the assumptions that she lied about being attacked are concerning. don't get me wrong, i remember that idiot McCain supporter who carved a backwards \"B\" on her own face back in 08. it's not impossible. but please, do not let your doubts slip out, or you're 100% going to be painted as a villain. and if she is traumatized.... oof. \n  \nideally, you'd be able to sit her down, maybe apologize for the outburst in public, but tell her that the two of you need to talk about this, since like it or not you're family. but she called you a child abuser, so... yeah. this is beyond my paygrade.", "ESH wrong time and place. You let this fester until you snapped in a very public setting. Instead there should've been a conversation in private, much earlier. \nIf it's trauma she needs therapy (likely couldn't hurt regardless). If it's racism, you'd needed to talk to her first. That way her mother could've set rules and consequences.\n\nWhy did her mother not address the issues earlier on with her daughter? Why did she let this continue? Where is her responsibility as a parent?\nBecause you might be with her mother, but you're not really a parent to this girl.", "ESH, your wife is the most AH here. She and you clearly don't believe a kid was assaulted, therefore she did nothing about it. And even when a child shows trauma response, you prefer to call her racist, instead to dealing with the core issue.", "Info: have you considered that a \"beating with no visible bruises\" might mean rape?\n\nHave you also considered that if someone was going to assault someone else, a place without cameras is exactly where they would lie in wait?\n\nIt's impossible for us to know, but here are the options that I can see.\n\n1) She was assaulted, her fear of people who look like her attacker is based in trauma, not racism. You have treated a victim of assault quite harshly when the only path to her not being scared of every block person would likely be extensive therapy. You may have even made things worse.\n\n2) She made up the assault story and is just racist. You escalated a public fight and ended up in a disagreement with your wife about the wrong thing. The two of you should be talking about how you can't be expected to exist in a racist household, not you being too harsh.\n\nIt seems to me you picked the best way to fail no matter which option is true.\n\nPersonally I say this is like when someone threatens suicide. You call emergency services, even if you think they are lying. Either they were telling the truth and you saved them, or they are unlikely to tell you that lie again.\n\nIn this case emergency services would be extensive therapy to \"help her recover from the assault, which has left her traumatised and left you being a black person living with someone who is scared of black people. Not fair on her or you\".\n\nIf her mother or her refuse therapy for her, you have a bigger problem.", "There is so much wrong here with your wife and her daughter. \n\nThe mother knows smthg happened to her, but there seems to be no actions in place to actually help her daughter?\n\nThe mother knows her daughter has trauma around black ppl and goes and marries a black man (while not doing anything to help her daughter).\n\nYour wife isn't a good mom and if this was me, i would try to get out of this as fast as possible. Something is terrible wrong here and i have the bad gut feeling that it will end with horrible accusations against you and you may even end up in jail.", "Regardless of the cause, the kid needs therapy. Either she is a racist or she was assaulted.  A therapist can get to the cause, that should be the goal of the OP.", "Info: how is she around people of other races? How is she around black women?", "I think the daughter needs therapy, her remarks seem to stem from trauma rather than racism.I also think that if other people in the restaurant heard this , and if the daughter repeats those very specific accusations ( it seems that what happened to her???, I hope not though),around others,your reputation, your livelihood, and your life would be at risk. Have family therapy if needed. But meanwhile, don\u2019t stay alone with the daughter at the house, go for a walk, don\u2019t engage or raise your voice or call out her behaviour until this is resolved and your wife should talk and seek therapy for her daughter.", "ESH\n\nYou should have had this conversation in private. \n\nHer mother should have gotten her therapy in order to get to the bottom of whatever happened. It is tricky because of the lack of bruises. People are assuming that maybe she was sexually assaulted. But we have nothing to go on to assume that either since she hasn't said it was sexual in nature. This is why she needs therapy so that she can eventually feel able to describe what happened. This is an assumption on my part. But I wouldn't be surprised if she got catcalled. It's creepy enough to deal with as an adult woman. But it often starts at a young age. Gross older dudes do that to middle schoolers all the time.\n\nWhile it is possible that she is acting out because of truama, her issues don't give her the right to hurt others. Like, I get being wary if something happened to her. But she is with family at a restaurant, and the server happened to be a black man. What could she even mean by a bad aura? Do you think she'd be willing to explain to her mom if asked? That's what makes this so frustrating. As a Black woman, if I find a guy of any race creepy upon first meeting, usually it's because he's blatantly ogling me(I am not saying the waiter was doing this to your stepdaughter). So even more reason for therapy, because she is 16, not 8. She should be able to describe why she is feeling unsettled. Either her trauma makes her unable to say what actually is wrong. Or her truama makes her misinterpret every action. Or she's just racist and maybe a therapist can figure out who/what filled her head with racist notions.", "nta she is definitly racist and disrespectful too you need to have a serious conversation with your wife expressing how you are not okay with racism and if she is going to continue to let her daughter be racist then they should find somewhere else to live as your wife is enabling the behaviour", "Ehhhhh this is a hard one, I would say at this particular moment you were the AH for ruining dinner but not the AH for feeling how you are feeling. Story May seem a bit shady to someone who wasn\u2019t there to experience it but I think doubting anything happened to her when you weren\u2019t there is unfair. She does have some issues though, for sure. Seems like your wife needs to get a handle on it before it gets much worse", "However you felt about it, YTA because time and place, and specifically, you don't actually know what's going on. People are constantly being casually accused of racism now days, so it's a very touchy thing. As her future step-father, it's your responsibility to approach this responsibly and try to figure out what really did happen.", "NTA . Idgaf what trauma she experienced it's never an excuse for blatant racism and that's 100% what it is. She needs a therapist yesterday", "Sounds like just an excuse to be racist \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Yta - she did nothing wrong.", "E S H.  Her mother is the AH for enabling her daughter's behavior.  \n\nNTA.  If she were normalized to people of color growing up, there wouldn't be a problem.  \n\n> Don't be like my mom and move to the poorest part of town before 3rd-grade starts.", "NTA Appears A made up the story about assault to give her a reason for her racism to be accepted by others and not called out for it. She should not be living in the same house as you because she will eventually have people listen to her wrecking your reputation. She needs therapy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
