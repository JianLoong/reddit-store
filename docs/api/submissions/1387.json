The weather forecast predicted the temperatures would drop a bit in my local area but it turns out they ended up dropping considerably more than it had been predicted and they came accompanied by an intense wind that intensified the cold even more. \n\nThis morning, I had to send my nephew to school and I thought that the jacket he had brought from home was not enough for the unexpected cold snap we were facing. So I had an idea: I've got a daughter who is already 18 years old but I still keep her old clothes from when she was my nephew's age, including her old coat and scarf. \n\nThe coat and the scarf are both pink and are decorated with a cutesy floral motif. I gave them to my nephew but as soon as he saw them he threw a tantrum saying that those clothes were for girls and that his classmates would laugh at him if they saw him dressed like that. I told him that, as her aunt, it was my duty to make sure to keep him warm and that I didn't care about what his classmates thought and neither should he. \n\nIt took me a while, but I managed to convince him to wear the coat and the scarf after I told him that if he didn't want those clothes then he could walk outside wearing his puny jacket and check for himself just how cold it was, which he did, and reluctantly accepted to wear the coat and the scarf afterwards. \n\nA few hours passed and I went to the school to pick him up, he came to me crying. It turns out that he was right, his classmates had made fun of him for wearing those clothes. \n\nI tried to comfort him but he yelled that it was my fault. I spoke to my brother about it and he told me not to worry and assured me that I had done what I had to do, but hearing my nephew cry like that and knowing he got laughed at for something that was my decision made me feel bad.", "created_utc": 1667597207, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymaylf/aita_for_forcing_my_nephew_to_wear_girly_winter/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hypothermia is nothing to mess with", "A better choice would have been to talk to his teacher and see there was an extra coat he could borrow. More than likely there was. YTA. This will carry with your nephew for a very long time", "YTA Talk about setting a boy up to be bullied.\n\nPink with floral trimming. This as not going to cause him just 1 day of problems. He will still be teased about it still in 6 months time. \n\nDo you have any idea how much damage you have done. Your brother is also TA for saying it's ok.", "Slight YTA you should have known better but at the same time it was for the best", "YTA. \n\nLittle kids are cruel. You sent him out in blatantly \"girly\" clothing and expected what to happen, exactly?", "YTA. Surely an adult-sized coat and scarf in a more neutral color would have been a better choice. Don't you remember how cruel kids are?", "Yta. Kids are cruel. If he wasnt prepared, you run to the local Walmart or target or even a thrift store. You dont send an 8 yr  old boy to school wearing pink. But if he was close enough to attend his school, you couldn't run by & grab his coat?", "INFO: was there a friend he could have called to borrow a coat from? A neighbour? Could he have worn ten jumpers? Did you not have a single other scarf in the house? Even a jacket of yours, however oversized? A blanket?! Was there literally no other option than a cutesy pink floral coat and scarf that he told you he\u2019d get teased for wearing?\n\n(The real AH is society conditioning these kids to tease, but we\u2019re in that society so we have to deal.)", "YTA I think you knew he\u2019d get picked on for those clothes! You could have loaned him something more neutral", "Yta, you could have just had him layer up. Even if he needed to wear her clothes if he didnt have enough to layer his own under his jacket you could have let him ditch them in the school bathroom, or drive him.", "YTA oh yeah. You scarred and embarrassed him at his school. Aunty, my ass.", "NTA, yes we all know that children are ruthless but in the end it'll all be forgotten. Most of all, there was a cold snap and OP just did what was right which was to prioritize the kid's safety. You'd rather have the kid suffer hypothermia in proper gender oriented clothing?", "YTA. Unless you\u2019re new to this planet, you knew that kid was going to get picked on for a pink coat. Yeah it sucks. Yes it\u2019s society\u2019s fault everything is so gendered. But the truth is, that poor kid will probably be teased about this for a while.  Did you not have a single other coat he could have used, even if it was too big?", "YTA, even tho I hate that gender roles are so rigid that a boy can't wear pink at all.  He's already in an out-of-whack situation by staying at your home, not his own, and his parents are gone.  I hope you apologize to him, and go buy him a boy coat, even if it's at Goodwill.", "You knew the poor kid would be teased unmercifully, yet you forced him to wear that old girly coat. YTA\u2014PS-Why do you have clothes that your daughter outgrew a decade ago?", "NTA freezing is way worse than being laughed at once don\u2019t worry about it this will not scar him for life he will come to understand", "NAH, you were doing your best to keep him warm and safe. Kids are AH.  Poor kiddo.  Lots of hugs and maybe something special?  Movie or some other activity he really enjoys to make up for it?  Definitely an apology, but you were being a responsible adult and had to make due.  Shiitake happens.", "Was driving him to school not an option?", "INFO: How long between the unexpected drop in weather and him needing to go to school? Because if it was the same day, or the night before, then N T A as you had to improvise if there really was nothing else you could have possibly put him in. \n\nBut if you had a little bit of time, was there no way you could get a really cheap coat and ask your brother to reimburse you? It wasn't your fault they hadn't left one for him. Or at least found a neighbour with a kid of a similar age/size that you could've asked to borrow a coat from. If there was time, then Y T A.", "YTA.", "Nta. You did the best you could with what you had. It's not like his parents provided the right stuff and you chose to put him in his cousin's things. Better a teasing then a freezing", "NTA. You can\u2019t let him freeze because he doesn\u2019t want to wear pink. Funny story one time my mother for whatever damn reason dressed my older brother in an all purple sweatsuit when he was like 10 or so, and he was laughed at RELENTLESSLY by his peers. He walked to the principal\u2019s office and said - I have to go home to change. Principal took one look and said \u2026 yeah, go ahead. (This was in the 1980s.) He laughs about it now. Kids are resilient.", "YTA it was your fault. Of course kids were going to laugh at him.", "YTA", "NAH.\n\nYou were being a good Aunt and making sure the kid didn't freeze. \n\nAt the same time, it sucks that he's getting teased and he's right to be upset by that. \n\nYou both have valid concerns and it's mostly just a terrible situation because kids can be terrible bullies. The only AH here is the kids who teased him.", "Sorry-YTA-you had to know that was going to happen.  Kids are mean.", "Eh\u2026I feel like this situation is fucked all around. Kids are gonna be mean, it would\u2019ve been better to get him something new (even if it\u2019s from a thrift store) just so there wouldn\u2019t be any opportunity for him to get hurt by the other kids. I understand that YOU don\u2019t care, but always consider how others may react because people will always find ways to be cruel.", "YTA. Absolutely. You should have listened to him and he won\u2019t live this down any time soon. Bloody hell. Couldn\u2019t stop by a store and pick up a jacket? You may not have the financial means I get that but school has lost property, a thrift shop, taking the day off because he didn\u2019t have appropriate clothing for the day\u2026.. \n\nPink and sparkly\u2026. Jesus. Boys can wear whatever but he didn\u2019t want to. It\u2019s that simple.", "Yta", "Lmao I'm imagining the scene from a Christmas story where the mom forces the kid into that bunny costume. YTA lol", "YTA.  For him you will always be his asshole aunt.  A moniker you seem to wear with pride. Maybe he can make you a sticker for your birthday.", "NTA, kids are cruel but you did what you had to to keep him warm.", "YTA. What is wrong with you, were you raised in isolation? Children are cruel and have long memories (as well as cell phones with cameras in this day and age). It takes a lot less than this to become victim of bullying. The fact that it is wrong does not make it less true. Why would you put your nephew through this. If you were that concerned, have him miss first period and buy him a boys jacket from a thrift store for Pete's sake ..", "YTA. I think even if you meant well, ultimately 8 year olds are mean. Sometimes you have to take in consideration that socially it may affect the kid more than it would physically. Even if you don\u2019t care what the other kids think, and he doesn\u2019t care what the other kids think, being laughed at or even bullied in this case can have an extremely negative impact on a kid.\n\nWould there have been any way to have him layer up or have him where one of your scarves or hats?", "It is a hard one. You had to know that he would get laughed out, pink with flowers, for a 8 year old boy... But you felt that there was no other option I guess. However if you had other options like other bigger coat more neutral maybe, or layering of his on clothes then you are TA. But in the end he will forgive you and it will become a funny story of when he went to school in a pink coat...", "Honestly I think NTA. You had good intentions, you just wanted to keep your nephew warm and had nothing else. I think the ones to blame are the kids who bully others because of artificial gender norms. And for those saying that you've scarred him for life, I don't find it to be that big of a deal, I once got laughed at in 4th grade because a classmate was sitting right next to me and we were drawing stuff and he thought my drawing of Mickey Mouse was ugly so he took it from me and showed it to the whole class while I cried and everyone laughed. I felt horrible the day it happened but we were just kids, it hasn't scarred me for life, your nephew will be fine and he'll probably remember it as nothing more than a silly anecdote when he grows up.", "YTA and duh that's how it would turn out. How could any adult not think that was the outcome and that he'll likely be made fun of for a while now. Kids are mean.", "NTA, and it seems like this would be a good teaching moment for his classmates. Bullying because of \"incorrect\" use of gendered items is ignorant and should not be tolerated in the year 2022. When I was your nephew's age, a friend had a pink girl's bicycle purchased from a yard sale because his parents couldn't afford to buy him a new one. Nobody made fun of him for it, we helped him to decorate his bike by drawing skulls and crossbones all over it with sharpies. These kids are old enough to know better.", "NTA. \nWhat were you supposed to do? It got cold suddenly and you had to provide clothes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However I absolutely see where he's coming from. He knew exactly what was gonna happen and its unfair, but kids do be like that.", "T real AH here is societal gender norms and parents who raise their kids with such rigid views that they bully others who appear different.", "It will not all be forgotten, that's for damn sure. These are kids we're talking about. A reasonable adult would forget it pretty quickly. Kids will keep making fun of him for the entire school year at least, and he's going to carry a grudge against his aunt until adulthood.", "We live in a small town, everyone brings their kids to school on foot except in rare circumstances such as a really bad storm or things like that. Also, he still would have needed the coat and scarf for recess. I couldn't let him step outside my house without  making sure he was dressed for the cold.", "I checked the weather forecast the previous night. Then we woke up and I checked the weather again and noticed the drop in temperatures while we were having breakfast.

A teaching moment.\n\nThe other kids are going to see him crying and say: Oh dear, we didn't mean for this to happen. Now we realise bullying is bad. \n\nNo no no, they're going to burst out laughing and say: He really is a girl, look at him crying in his pink coat.

YTA", "Probably yeah first hand experience would also support that, OP should adjust herself because in the end it's a kid she's dealing with. But I could never blame the aunt for choosing the sensible option of not letting the kid wear light clothing in such weather.", "So driving him was an option is what you're saying", "Technically it was, but I didn't consider it because I thought he was already warm wearing my daughter's winter gear. And like I said, he went outside during recess, so he would have needed the coat and the scarf anyways.", "Or drive him and speak to the school that this particular day he didn't have a warm enough coat & could they do an indoor play for him this once?\n\nYTA", "Or if the school is close enough to walk from your house I would assume his house where his jacket is is also close.
