{"id": 18849, "submission_id": "13z4ohc", "title": "AITA for ruining vacation because my cat suddenly died?", "selftext": "(English Is my secondary language and I am not from the US)\n\nMe [27F], my Boyfriend [34M] and two of our friends [27 F and 32 M] went on a couples vacation about 2 hours away from our hometown. It was supposed to be a week long stay, from Saturday to saturday.\n\nOn Wednesday, so right after 3 days, by BF recieved a tearful call from his mom, my cat sitter, that she found one of my cats dead on the floor. She seemed absolutely healthy and happy the night before and was excited to recieve visitors. We were absolutely devastated, I loved her so much.\n\nRegardless to say, the vacation was over for me. Even if I couldn't do anything to help her live anymore, I couldn't leave her in my apartment for the next days. I called my parents to arrange her funeral. \n\nNow, we told our friends, who were right there when I received the news, that they have two options: they could stay or come with us. The problem is, that I was the only one with a car and we booked a residence at a rather remote location, with the next town being 15 minutes away by car and the bus arriving every two hours. That is also what they said so they started packing. They were not happy.\n\nOn the ride home (my BF insisted on driving, so I could process my grief), 27F complained about her lost vacation. My BF answered something neutral but I could hear he was pissed at her complaining.\n\nNow that my cat was buried and a few days have passed I recall the last days. And I want to know, if I was the AH for ruining our vacation? I am still grieving and unhappy with our friends lack of empathy, but I guess it was just a cat for them, which is fine. But I am reconsidering my friendship with them. But maybe they were right to be angry, I don't know anymore.\n\nEdit: I offered my friends compensation so they could rent a car the town over, but they did not want to drive on their own, so they refused. It would have been possible to rent the car and return it back in our hometown as the rental service operates nationwide.", "created_utc": 1685777258, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13z4ohc/aita_for_ruining_vacation_because_my_cat_suddenly/", "score": 112, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe inconvenient, but they could absolutely organize, if they wanted to continue the holiday.", "NTA\n\nDefinitely not. You're grieving because a member of your family suddenly passed away.. It doesn't matter it's a cat, pets are family and for some people these pets mean more than other family members (like for me) \n\nYou gave them the option to stay, you didn't ruin their vacation because they decided to come along with you. Sure they wouldn't have had a car, but that isn't entirely your problem either... They have a bus that goes.. \n\nYour 27F friend though is a massive asshole for making those comments. That's not okay", "Absolutely NTA!! Pets are family, and you lost one very unexpectedly. Of course you\u2019re devastated and want to go home. \nI can understand your friend being disappointed about their holiday being cut short, but if they really wanted to stay, they could have arranged to get the bus themselves, as they had 3 days to plan for it. \nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\n> Now that my cat was buried and a few days have passed I recall the last days. \n\nI'm just so, so sorry. There's nothing I can say that will make that hurt any less.\n\n> And I want to know, if I was the AH for ruining our vacation?\n\n#NO!\n\nUnequivocally, undeniably, indubitably **no**.", "NTA. Losing a pet is terrible. You didn\u2019t force your friends to come back with you - there was a bus service and presumably taxis in the town. Could they have rented a car?\n\nI can totally understand why they\u2019d feel upset, but they also couldn\u2019t have expected you to be their chauffeur for the weekend whilst you were really upset. It\u2019s unfortunate timing, but it doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. It was unforeseen circumstances, so you are definitely not at fault. Your friend can feel about it however she wants but saying you ruined their vacation makes her a rude asshole. \n\nYou did not ruin their vacation, they could have stayed by themselves just fine. Especially considering there is a bus every two hours. You also add that you offered to compensate them so they can rent a car, but they refused. So they could have continued their vacation just fine if they were willing to spend a little more effort to either take the bus or drive themselves.\n\nIf you choose to go on vacation and are not willing or able to drive you are dependent on the driver. They made their choice.", "Nope NTA, you can grief all you want, your cat just passed. Even if your friend was annoyed she should not have spoken up.", "NTA\n\nNo Honey, you're not an asshole for grieving and having to leave. Your \"friends\" could have hired their own car. Hell, they could have ordered an uber. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. People without pets might not understand the bond. You gave them options to stay and continue their vacation. \n\nYour boyfriend seems like a good guy for supporting you. Losing a pet unexpectedly is difficult.", "NTA. I lost my kitty almost two years ago and I still bawl over it. They are family and it hurts like losing family when they are gone. Your \"friends\" are very insensitive, but I am glad your boyfriend understands how you feel and has your back.", "NTA, and maybe it's for the best your 'friends' showed their true colours", "NTA. You cannot plan this. You gave them an option to stay and they decided to leave as well. At this point it might be them complaining that the vacation is ruined because a tornado or earthquake happened, really. It was insensitive from their side, albeit a bit understandable they will be disappointed but you are in NO WAY the asshole here.", "NTA.\nSo sorry for your loss.", "NTA and I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you lost your kitty but that would ruin my vacation", "I would say NAH. You\u2019re DEFINITELY not, it\u2019s natural to grieve for a pet. Sorry to hear about your cat. \n\nYour friend was insensitive for complaining in front of you - but at the end of the day, they did lose 3-4 days of vacation they paid for/took time off work for. So it\u2019s understandable that they\u2019d be bummed also.", "NTA. Changed my opinion. \n\nYou seem to have offered all available options. If they choose not to take it they cannot complain about it. \n\n~~YTA I understand your grief and why you wanted to leave and that's totally justified. But Your friend's vacation was also ruined because of you. They trusted you with the transport by coming in your car. They had to leave a fully paid vacation for which they probably got no refund with you because of the lack of a better transport option not because they wanted to. So i understand why the girlfriend blames you. Maybe they will learn this lesson and arrange their own transport in future.~~", "NAH. You're right to be extremely upset that your cat died. They're also right to be annoyed to have to shorten their vacation for a cat they don't have strong bonds with. Any chance you could have been dropped to the station for them to continue their holidays?", "NAH. It\u2019s totally understandable that you would be very upset and want to go home to grieve your pet. \nIt\u2019s also understandable that your friends would be upset and disappointed about her holiday being cut short.", "YTA  Grief for a pet is real, and you shouldn't feel bad for that. Throwing off multiple people crosses the line into being a dick. You ruined everyone's time, and it just isn't justified  I'm sorry.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can't call you an AH for wanting to go home to your cat. But I can't call your friends AHs for being annoyed. They planned a trip, took time off work and paid for it. I understand you offered to pay for a car rental, but if they're not comfortable driving in the area or do not have licences, then that's not a real solution. The trip was planned based on everyone's driving allowances and if you did not want to be relied on for driving, you should have chosen somewhere with public transport. But you accepted being the responsible driver. It's not fair to then try to make them drive, if that was never presented as a back up when the trip was planned. So I see both sides. It's just unfortunate.", "Thank you for your kind words.", "Yes I agree, it was bad for everyone. I offered money so they could rent a car, but my friend doesn't like driving herself and her boyfriend does not have a license. And I had to leave, even if I didn't want to, since my cat was and still is my responsibility that I couldn't let my future MIL shoulder alone.", "Thank you for your judgement, which I agree with. I would have been bummed too but not voiced my complaints. Then again, they do not have pets, so I get it that they were indifferent.\n\nIt was a bad situation for everyone I guess.", "I don't think there is any lesson to be learned here. Life happens. Is everybody supposed to take their own cars on the slim chance that one of them has some kind of personal issue that needs to be dealt with?", "Thank you for your judgement, which I think is justified. If the roles were reversed I probably would have been saddened by my vacation being cut short too. I offered my friends compensation for the lost time, so they could maybe rent a car, but they refused. Unfortunately I had to drive back to my hometown for two hours and then to my parents for about 3 hours to bury her. I live in an apartment and no option for burial or cremation in town. She would have been brought to a vet to be disposed in medical waste and I couldn't do that to her. I wanted her to be in a place where I could visit her.", "Hard disagree. NTA. They had an option to stay and continue the vacation, and while it wasn\u2019t the most viable they could have taken it.", "Thank you for your honest judgement. It was a sh**ty situation for all people involved. I wish I could have come home today to have her greet me at the door. But it just wasn't meant to be.\n\nI should have mentioned that I offered financial compensation for them so they could rent a car for the last three days, but they didn't want to drive themselves as we were in a mountainy area.\nBut reddit complained about my word count.", "Sure life happens. But this didn't happen to them. They got caught Op's situation. They are out of money and vacation time. So of course in their mind they'll blame her for it. And themselves. Because the girlfriend probably feels their vacation wouldn't be ruined if they had their own car.", "In this case, NTA. You offered a compensation, they did not take it, that's on them.", "I am very sorry for your kitty! NTA of course, and it is beyond my understanding why somebody downvoted this particular comment, where you explained that you offered them money so that they could use the rest of their holiday.", "OP did offer to get them a rental car so they could continue their vacation if they wanted to. They didn't want to drive themselves so I don't think OP is TA. She offered compensation and they didn't take it.", "Oh i didn't see this update before. That definitely changes the story. She should have added that in the post earlier. I am changing my judgement.", "NTA- You offered an alternative (rental car) and they did not have to go back with you.", "NTA. Why didn't they just rent a car like any normal person would have? You aren't required to stay on through your grief in order to be their personal chauffeur.", "NTA for the reasons people have already said. Was the cat very elderly? You stated you have more than one cat, and ONE went from lively to dead overnight. You should definitely try to figure out why, to ensure there is nothing in your house that is toxic and could hurt your other babies. (No new plants/cleaning supplies/small items that can be choked on. Could a neighbor have put out rat poison, and then the mouse got in your apartment and your cat ate it?)", ">Your friend was insensitive for complaining in front of you \n\nThat definitely makes the friend an AH", "NAH.  It takes a lot of time and effort to plan a vacation, and they not only lost some of the only time they get on earth (you only get one life), but they lost out on money and maybe even PTO.\n\nYour reaction to return home to grieve your cat is natural, but you also have to understand that your choices affected other people and they don't have to pretend to be happy about that.", "NTA and I\u2019m so so sorry about your cat. Had it been me, I woulda been leaving within 15 minutes and depending on the drive I woulda maybe offered to come back and get them at the end of the vacation. Maybe. But I woulda been devastated and on my way home immediately.", "Yeah, that\u2019s not \u201cremote\u201d, that\u2019s inconvenient at best but you offered multiple ways to rectify it. NTA, sorry for your loss OP!", "> my friend doesn't like driving herself\n\nThat\u2019s a her problem, not a you problem"]}
