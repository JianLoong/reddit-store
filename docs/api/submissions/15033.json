We went to a bar, did karaoke, the whole shebang. But at around midnight, things got a little stale and one of my coworkers said her friend had weed so we all went to this guy\u2019s house. Long story short, I felt very uncomfortable and pressured and after having a panic attack in the bathroom, I called Josh. He didn\u2019t pick up. I called another friend but she didn\u2019t answer either so as a last ditch effort, I called Michael. He picked up and I asked him if he could come get me.

He ended up crashing on the couch and the next morning, I have him petrol money. I apologised profusely. He said not to worry.\n\nThe issue is that the girls in the friend group are now calling me a \u2018pick me\u2019 and saying I put myself in the situation as an excuse to \u2018get Michael in your \\[my\\] life\u2019 as it upset me that he didn\u2019t like me. As a side note, I was more confused about why he doesn\u2019t like me, I was never upset.

There's a whole app specific to it, however we were technically in another town which I didn't realise until I went on the app. I had to download a whole new app and prices were insane.
