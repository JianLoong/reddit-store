It\u2019s always seemed off to me.  A bit too flexible, and often a way of describing general behavior to put it in the worst light possible and hate on someone.\n\nSome assholes get grouped it, but it\u2019s a word that had a wide gray zone application that covers people who are fundamentally fine.\n\nIt\u2019s always seemed a bit like a sexist stereotype to me.", "^ That's not pick-me behavior, that's just flirty behavior (?). Pick-me behavior is directly tied to putting other women down and (very often) acting like \"one of the guys\" to seem more interesting to a potential love interest. As said in a precious reply, it's often associated with the \"not like other girls\" trope, and can be traced back to the surgence of manic pixie girls as ideal love interests back in 2010-2015.", "It'll shock you when you realize you were also an asshole as a teenager lol.", "Same , enemies to lovers are best version of romance", "NTA. Take care of yourself moving forwards. Don\u2019t let the slander of others affect you", "Before I get to the verdict, just a quick aside, as I relate to Michael:\n\nIt's unwise to assume someone dislikes you just because they're short with you. I am a very quiet/introverted person, unless I know the people very well. ~1 year, that's not enough time for me to be openly friendly with a new addition to a friend group.\n\nI sincerely doubt he dislikes you because if he did, he wouldn't have bothered answering or made an excuse up or decline.\n\nI've had plenty of people growing up thinking I disliked them or had something against them, but I just didn't really have anything to say.\n\nChances are he's still warming up to ya.\n\nAnyhow, NTA. Michael honestly sounds like more of a friend than the others from this situation. That and your friend's first thoughts not being, \"Oh, sorry for not picking up\" and \"wow such a pick me.\" speaks volumes of their character.", "So far in this story I like the nay saying girls the least.  I didn\u2019t read any hard evidence to suggest Michael dislikes you either just conjecture.  NTA.", "NTA, when it comes down to it you do what you have to do to stay safe.  You felt very unsafe, you called him as a last resort.  You know he doesn\u2019t really like you and it sounds like you stayed your distance and showed appreciation for his help.  The other girls sound like they\u2019re jealous you got any attention from Michael, which whatever.  Also, sounds like Michael is an ok guy for getting you out of a rough situation, despite your differences.  Glad you\u2019re safe.", "Nta;\n\nHow are you a \u201cpick me\u201d? Did you put down any of the other girls? \n\nYou know three people that can drive. You called all three, only one showed up.\n\nDo they realize that you don\u2019t have to continue talking to Michael after this interaction other than to be like \u201cYou\u2019re cool dude, thanks\u201d.", "NTA.  Calling Michael doesn't make you a \"pick me.\"  Your other options for getting out of a situation where drugs were present didn't pan out, so what else did the women in your friend group expect you to do?  Thank goodness Michael turned out to be a stand-up guy and I'm wondering if the women in question are jealous of you.", "The girls dont sound like friends you want to have in your life.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nIf Michael was fine with picking you up, then he was fine with picking you up. Moreover, you apologized for inconveniencing him and paid him petrol money.", "Not the asshole.\n\nYour \"friends\" are unclear about what a \"pick me\" is.\n\nUnless one or all are attracted to Michael why would they be upset that their girl friend asked for help to get out of an uncomfortable situation?\n\nAlso I'm now dying to know why Michael doesn't like you.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t have to agree to give you a ride. Those girls don\u2019t sound like your friends - they sound catty.", "You tried all your other options. You didn\u2019t plan this or have some kind of manipulative plan to seduce this guy. You made the best decision to keep yourself safe. These girls sound jealous and mean.

You needed a ride and he was the only one that was around at the time and from the edit was your only choice on how to get home from an uncomfortable situation. You were not a pick-me girl. A pick-me girl would have gone out of her way to get that person's attention all the time and would not have even attempted to contact anyone else but him constantly . I think maybe the other girls are jealous of you and like the fact he has an issue with you and him doing things for you kind of throws a wrench into that", "Does this 'Michael' happen to be a super hot dude ? That would explain literally everything.", "NTA\n\nyou called two other people before contacting him. You needed help amd he was a last resort. That doesn't make you a 'pick me'", "Wait, the other girls said it? Thinking \" the other girls\" might be the reason you and Michael don't get along. #FursFlying", "NTA and that's not what the term \"pick me\" means. Pick-me behaviour would have been putting other girls down to curry favour with Mike, not asking for his help and paying him petrol money as a thanks/apology for him going out of his way. Also he probably doesn't dislike you, he's just not close to you, or he could be really shy around girls.", "Michael sounds like a good bloke. Have you considered that he\u2019s just really shy? My closest pal is like this with women but it\u2019s not cos he doesn\u2019t like them, I think he just has no idea what to say. Even with some women he\u2019s knows for 10 years now, it\u2019s painful to watch sometimes.\nTbf he does the same thing with new guys but gets comfortable with them much faster.", "Nta also Micheal sound like a nice guy maybe you could try to talk why he doesn't like you like adults", "NTA.
