Stacy threatening not to come over anymore is a win! \n\n>My mom thinks I should have been the bigger person and told Stacy to get off instead of ducking.\n\nHow you resisted replying to your mom with something like \"mom, it is literally impossible for me to be the bigger person, so I will just stick to sticking up for myself instead\" is beyond me. \ud83d\ude05", "Your dad is right, NTA. you stood up to a bully.", "NTA - Your dad is right, she deserved it. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA, fuck around and find out, you already told her you didn\u2019t like that.", "NTA. She was acting like a piece of trash, and got humiliated for doing so. Is her little ego hurt? sure. She was told not to do it. She f'cked around.... and gravity gave her the nudge into the find out part.", "NTA. Stacy is a bullying AH with a pathetically bad sense of humor. Also, she\u2019s clearly learned nothing from this and is attempting to bully you in a different way now. Your sister has bad taste in friends.", "NTA. \n\nYou already told her not to do that - it is her own fault. If anything, she owes you an apology for touching you after you\u2019d said no.", "LMAO & NTA. Props are dangerous! \n\nNo way she should put that much weight into a 'prank'.", "NTA that\u2019s hilarious. I actually chuckled using my vocal cords.", "NTA.\n\nShe fucked around and found out.\n\nI agree. Her not coming over is great.", "NTA. Stacy is a bully.  She knows her behavior makes you feel bad, and she has continued. Stacy is not your problem. Your problem is your mother's and sister's endorsing Stacy's bad behavior. Please pay attention to that and listen to people who support you. You are young, and I'm concerned that your mother's conduct might be a consistent thing. Don't let her establish your self value. Your instincts were correct.", "Nta\n\nYou did nothing to apologize for, and if she refuses to enter the house until you apologize just stand in the doorway and laugh at her everytime she comes around.", "NTA. You asked her not to do it again, and she did. She has to learn that her actions have consequences. Do not apologise, she should be the one apologising.", "NTA I hope she learned her lesson, you don\u2019t have to take that behavior from anyone.", "NTA and all of you would be better off without that asshole in your lives, she's the one that owes you an apology\n\nDon't listen to your mom btw, no idea why she wants you to be a feeble ineffectual doormat, Stacy would just ignore you if you told her to get off, just like she ignores your boundaries.", "NTA\n\nStacy is aware that you\u2019re not fond of her \u201cjokes\u201d including the physical placement of her arm on your head. She fell because she felt she could continue to bully you in that manner. It\u2019s no different than a guy snapping a bra strap because they think it\u2019s funny. In a way, Stacy doing that after you told her no is a type of an assault.", "NTA\n\nShe did something she know you don\u2019t like and have asked her not to do. In her attempt to embarrass you she ended up embarrassing herself. \n\nI can\u2019t believe anybody would expect you to tolerate and enable her behaviour.", "NTA\n\nStacy shouldn\u2019t be touching you , so why would you apologize?", "NTA. I'm short, too and absolutely hate when people do this. It is rude, condescending, and physically painful on my neck. Instead of moving, I elbow them as hard as I can in the stomach. When they complain, I say \"Sorry, did you not want to continue with the inappropriate touching game?\"\n\nAlso, when people tease you about your height do what my mom taught me. \"A person only grows until they reach perfection and some of us got there much earlier.\"\n\nSeriously, as long as your legs are long enough to reach the ground, they are long enough!", "NTA\nGot what she deserved\ud83d\ude02", "NTA.  Brilliant move, btw.", "She f\u2019d around and found out. Seems about right to me! From one short human to another-NTA", "lol. NTA.  If an apology is forced, tell her you are sorry that she didn't listen when you warned her the first time and you are also sorry that she is an AH.", "Nta- I myself am a shorty who has experienced the armrest attempts as well. I found people stopped doing that to me when some random dude at my high school tried it and I immediately exclaimed very loudly \"Oh my God you stink do you ever shower?!\" Very few people tried it after that. Feel free to keep that in your back pocket if you need it.", "NTA and since not apologizing also gets rid of the asshole infestation in your home, stick to it.", "She\u2019s the one who can\u2019t take a joke . Good for you for not letting them take advantage of you", "NTA it may have been cute the first time. It may have been funny. I don\u2019t happen to think so. You asked her not to do it again. She disregarded your wishes in your home. You moved. Play stupid games. Win stupid prizes", "NTA at all.", "Play stupid games...win stupid prizes. NTA", "NTA. All you did was not allow her to treat you in a way that you already asked her not to. Everything else was all Stacy. Actions have consequences. Perhaps this event will help Stacy learn that.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't state your age, but I'm guessing it's under 18. But look...    you tell someone not to touch you and they touch you, that's actually a criminal battery. I wouldn't run to the cops over something like that, of course, but the bottom line is they can't be doing it.\n\n(In fact, even if you don't tell them, an unwanted touching can constitute a battery if it is not accident)\n\nStacy sucks, haha at Stacy", "Dude what the absolute fuck is up with people using us short people as arm rests?  \n\nFfs I'm a person.  Get your fucking arms off my gd head and learn to ask permission?  Or, you know, treat me like I exist as more than a convenient place for you to rest your arms?\n\nNTA.\n\nYou told her no.  You asked her to stop.  That should have been good enough.  But apparently, for miss I'm 10 inches taller than you so I'm SOOO much better than you, you just exist to be my armrest and be the butt of my jokes, it wasn't.\n\nSucks to suck I guess.  \n\nMaybe next time she'll learn not to mess with a person short enough to evade her, and learn that no means no.  The (second now) time.", "NTA. You asked her to stop and she refused. Tell anyone who wants you to apologize that you have the right to stop another person from touching you when is is unwanted.", "NTA. She did it to you before, and she knows you didn\u2019t like it as you told her not to do it again. She was disrespectful to you and she should apologize to you. \n\nYou could (only if you want to) tell her you\u2019re sorry she fell down and was embarrassed by it, but you\u2019re not sorry for ducking to avoid being treated as an inanimate object. Definitely do NOT apologize for that!", "Tell your mom you *literally* cannot be the bigger person. \n\nNTA. And do NOT apologize.", ">My mom thinks I should have been the bigger person\n\nPHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE, MA! \n\nLol\n\nBut in all seriousness, no, NTA. You asked her previously not to do that and she did it anyways. Actions have consequences and the ones she suffered for her rudeness are super minor. \n\nFuck Stacey. She sucks.", "N T A at all.  I will go for ESH in this regard, everyone minus yourself.\n\n>My mom thinks I should have been the bigger person and told Stacy to get off instead of ducking.\n\nIf you were the bigger person, your height wouldn't be Stacy's subject to mock. Bad choice of words, mom.\n\nStacy is an AH for disregarding your boundaries and disrespecting you by bullying you based on something outside your control.\n\nYour sister is an AH for putting a bully as a \"friend\" before her own sister and not pulling Stacy up on her behaviour, and for inviting her over to your home, thus violating your safe space.\n\nYour mom is an AH for allowing Stacy into your home and giving her an opportunity to bully you. Put your own kid first, mom!\n\n>I don't think being short is even that bad. An economy plane seat is comfortably roomy for me. It's an advantage in the sport I play.
