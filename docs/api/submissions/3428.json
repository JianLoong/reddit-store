Nice to see she left that out of the post.", "Lol, way to bury the lede", "Happy this is the first comment I saw was going to go N but when I saw the Australia bit it went to YTA.", "You can be fair by providing an equal amount of money to each kid.  You can be fair by committing to a specific level of help (eg, through undergrad or will pay room and board) to each child - and I think it\u2019s even fair to set limits here, like tuition the equivalent of the relevant state school and if they choose one more expensive the rest is on them.  You can even be fair by offering no help to anyone, although that sucks if you can afford to help a bit.\n\nGiving one child the rest of their fund for something else and then providing more for education isn\u2019t fair.  OP and husband are going to ruin their relationship with the younger daughter.  Or, they can provide both an equal amount of help beyond the initial college fund - or give younger daughter the cost of a cool international trip and she can use that as she sees fit.", "THIS", "oh gosh, I messed that comment.

I've seen loans of up to $500,000 after graduation. Sounds like golden child syndrome to me. I had a similar issue with my dad. He didn't think that women should be doctors so he refused to sign the financial papers that would allow me to get the scholarships that I was entitled to. So I had to get loans for the full amount. This will lead to resentment and then OP will be posting about the child that abandoned her.", "This.", "This is exactly it! So if K had initially not gone to college and used that money to party in Ibiza, OP surely wouldn't have a problem paying for her studies later when she wants to?

Whatever extra money she is getting should also go to your other daughter. She\u2019s being punished for not going on a trip? Really?", "So she did have her full college fund then.
