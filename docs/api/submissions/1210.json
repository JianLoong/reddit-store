She doesn't have dibs.

Don't engage with this behaviour, ignore it she either will decide the friendship is worth more or not.", "NTA This seems like an extreme reaction from your friend. I suspect there is something else going on. Some people get very upset if they feel they are being copied. Does she have a history of people copying her?", "NTA \n\nYou both liked it a freaking year ago! Doesn't matter who saw it first, you snooze you lose. And she has no claim on \"her style.\" She's being ridiculous."]}
