Idk what sort of person your mother is, but I can't stand mine or my grandmother on that side and I still wouldn't be such an opportunist. Working for family is always a tricky subject since it's harder to set boundaries, I get that. But she is your mother and is this actually the hill you want to die on? I'm sure she won't forget about it anytime soon.", "YTA\n\nRemember: you are not going to be working overtime/double shifts forever. Your grandparent is dying. Your mom is going through tremendous feelings and anticipatory grief and you're only thought is about money. Heartless.

Wow. Have some freaking compassion.", "Money is in all likelihood very tight even if the cancer is terminal. I don't know how you guys do funerals either. She's about to lose her mother, her heart is likely in a trillion or two pieces but she has to be strong and run things.  Get a little empathy.

Some things are more important than your free time.", "INFO: what is your mom paying you for? Is she your employer?", "\"I don't have a close relationship with my Grandmother...,\" you won't have a close relationship with your parents for much longer either if you keep this up.\n\nYTA\n\nYour mom wants to visit her dying mother; help her.", "YTA, you can\u2019t help your mom for a week so she can spend time with her dying mom. You and this guy sound incredibly selfish here.", "YTA. Hopefully you don't live with your mother and pay all of your own bills. Hopefully you never need help. You would be last one someone would offer help to.", "ESH\n\nWorking doubles for a week, while also attending school, is unrealistic.  You will neither do well at work nor do well at school trying to do this.\n\nHowever, this is your mother. And even if you don't get along with your grandmother, it is your mother's mother.  Who is terminally ill.  Even if it isn't possible to do all of the work, the non-AH path leads to you being supportive of your mother at this time, not dismissing her pain, grief, and struggle to care for her mother.   Whatever you do, you aren't doing it for your grandmother, you are doing it for your mother.\n\nWhat work would you be doing?  Legally, when you're working at the restaurant, you're her employee, as well as her daughter.  She needs to be following labor laws with your work, and also with everyone else who works for her.  That means, for hourly workers, time and a half when going over 40 hours.\n\nShe's effectively asking you to take a 50% cut in your hourly wages, by working twice as much for the same money.  This may even push you below the legal minimum wage. \n\nShe needs to have enough employees to cover things if someone can't work due to illness or family responsibilities, or if they quit, etc.\n\nIf your mother owns this restaurant, she needs to have a business model that does not rely on unpaid or under-paid labor to hold things together.\n\nAnd if she is the restaurant owner, she also needs to be aware that a college student is not going to be able to step in and do all the things that an owner does.  You may be able to wait tables, do dishes, or work in the kitchen.  You can't make arrangements with suppliers, or write checks to cover bills, or make and enforce the work schedule for all employees, or adjust the menu based on changes in available supplies and pricing variations, or quite a few other things.\n\nYour mother may well be gone for over a week.  I remember when my grandfather, my mother's father, died, she initially planned just to be gone for a week, to see him and help out a bit.  She wound up staying for over a month, as his health declined but his life still lingered, until he died, and then staying for the funeral. \n\nIf she is the business owner, she needs to have a realistic plan to deal with her absence for an unknowable length of time.  If the business is owned by someone else, it is up to them to work out how to cover the schedule, in a way that doesn't rely on you working a second unpaid shift every day, or missing classes, or not having time to complete assignments.", "Yta, just please do her this favor her mom is dying and she\u2019s going through a lot right now, a week of work won\u2019t kill ya. I don\u2019t like calling people out but it\u2019s necessary sometimes to be called out especially if you behavior is bad, just do this for her", "INFO: Is this a restaurant your mom owns, and will you be working overtime by covering her shifts?", "Info how many hours you worked last week?\n\nEdit: now it hit me do you work like for two persons and your mother may you one salary?\n\nIt may be por wording\n\nBut if you work 2 person work and you get one person salary it's called salary theft  no matter if it is family or not than nta\n\nBut if you work extra shifts and you get paid for extra shifts and you want be payed double for extra shifts yta.", "For the explicit question if you are an asshole for asking to be paid for your work (and I\u2019m assuming you mean you are working, say 20 hours instead of 10, and wanting to be paid for all 20 hours instead of your usual 10.) then no NTA. \n\nNow if what you mean is \u2018I usually earn 10$ an hour and now I want 20$ because it\u2019s extra hours\u2019 then yeah you Completely and absolutely TA. \n\nAnd yeah being a little helpful and understanding when your mother is facing losing her mother then yeah you very much come across as an asshole there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
