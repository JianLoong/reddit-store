Makes enough sense. \n\nHowever, they are seemingly adults, it makes sense that they'd be a little annoyed that they couldn't share a bed together.", "NTA, but are the people in this story legally able to drink?

It's neither your fault nor your problem that they don't get to sleep together, and you didn't owe them a bed to do so.", "You live with your parents and they wouldn't approve.

Nta", "Nta BUT I can see how your friends would have a problem with it. I think you should have talked to your friend before hand if you needed to set a rule about people sleeping together. I feel like your parents allowing you to have a party with underage drinking does seem to indicate that they have less rules than you wanted to impose. I don\u2019t think your reason really had to do with your parents and you should think about your truth and discuss that with your friend.", "NTA You are respecting your parent's rules and you cannot be AH for that.

To be fair you might be right that him pointing out specifically what kind of sex could be a case of the homophobia. Could be he is just specific on his wording cause well they only got two holes. So its oral or anal going on between the two who crashed there. If they have sex of course.\n\nTo be fair a lot of people point it out specifically cause anal sex doesn't get treated like just sex. I think it is due to the not being able to get pregnant from butt stuff. You have no idea how many times I see comments like \"They can't get pregnant so why not let them sleep together?\" It baffles me.", "Possible stains on the sheets, smells of sex, if friend and his bf are both naked and passed out by the time parents get home.
