When i enter the living room I hear my younger sister (4f) getting mad. I look at her and see my younger brother (8m) next to her laughing. I see that they are playing Call of Duty Mobile. She is playing on my the ipad and he on the phone. She keeps on losing to my brother and he keeps on laughing and forcing her to play another round making her even more mad and also taunting her. I ask my sister if I can play instead of her. She agrees and I start destroying my brother, knifing, nading etc. and it gets to a point where he even starts crying. I tell that's how she feels when he plays againts her. I close the game on the ipad and open up youtube kids the app that she likes tell her to watch her favorite show instead of forcing herself playing with him. My younger brother starts screaming and telling me to keep playing with him I refuse. So Reddit am I the asshole for teaching my brother a lesson?\n\nEdit:\n\nFor everyone asking where my parents were they were in the kitchen and when they heared my younger brother crying they told me to stop bothering him and I did stop. I also did this to show him how it feels to lose against someone else I didn't taunt him and even after I told him I would stop playing against him to not make him cry even more he told 'I am not gonna cry I promise' but I stopped. Thanks for your judgment and also every time my parents delete the game he still downloads it. But some days ago he stopped playing the game. Love to you all and I accept you guys judgment. - <3\n\nLittle Side Note :\n\nI don't even play CoD that much I'm more of a Minecraft type of guy and after the whole CoD incident I took my time to show my brother a game more for his age and now he spents his time watching Minecraft on youtube or playing on the phone. So don't all of you worry.PS : his favorite Minecraft Youtuber is Nico\n\nFor those who know Technoblade never dies - <3", "created_utc": 1689422251, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150a5yy/aita_for_teaching_my_brother_a_lesson/", "score": 481, "replies": ["I\u2019m surprised all the Y T A\n\nNTA.

Instead of giving him a taste of his own medicine and causing more hostility as someone 11 years older it would have been better to explain to him she can choose to not play and reinforce her by opening the app she does want to play and supporting her if 8yo starts to scream or yell.

Therefore you have no reason to be teaching your brother anything unless your actual parents have okayed it. If it was such a problem, then you should've told him it was time to play something else or diverted their attention elsewhere. Because all you did otherwise was bully him like he was doing to her. Which is just gonna reinforce that it's okay for older kids to make fun of younger ones.", "This is not teaching a lesson, although I understandwhy you frame it that way; you want validationfor your terrible behavior. This is a 19 year old being a horrible excuse for a brother. Way to go bullying a little kid, and the fact that you're so proud about it says it all. YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is just the kind of selfishness you have to deal with in some children, the kid didn't care how he made his sister feel, he laughed as she cried, do any of you honestly think he's capable of having anything but his own enjoyment in his head at this point?

It would do your relationship a lot of good if you set aside time to actively play together, show him your golden tips to improve, and bond.\n\nAdditionally, might be nice to play an age appropriate game with your little sister as well.\n\nChildren playing on screens by themselves/unmonitored at such a young age can be detrimental to their development, giving shorter attentionspans, often lowering fine motor skills (controller is a better than just phone, already), but that's your parents' flaw. \n(Source: currently studying to be an art teacher)\n\nChildren need an adult to teach them patience, how to deal with losing and not become a sore loser, and have emotional needs met.
