She is playing on my the ipad and he on the phone. She keeps on losing to my brother and he keeps on laughing and forcing her to play another round making her even more mad and also taunting her. I ask my sister if I can play instead of her. She agrees and I start destroying my brother, knifing, nading etc. and it gets to a point where he even starts crying. I tell that's how she feels when he plays againts her. I close the game on the ipad and open up youtube kids the app that she likes tell her to watch her favorite show instead of forcing herself playing with him.

Eight seems pretty young for that game, but four is completely out of bounds. Him screaming at you to continue playing is pretty darn worrisome, too.", "Yes and no. Overall no. You showed your brother what it felt like. He needed that. Your sister needed defending.\n\nEdit: that\u2019s too young to play COD.", "Your parents are the AH, what the heck is a 4 y.o doing playing those types of games and letting their kids bully one another?!?", "Nta, you beat him at a game. \nSo many people crying yta seem too sensitive. Beat ur brother at a game? Don't be surprised when he goes NC!!", "YES and your parents for letting kids play that game!!", "Your 8 month old brother is playing COD??", "You taught him nothing. I kinda hate how \"teaching a lesson\" is never used in relation to anyone teaching someone something. It is always, literally always \"I am jerk to you in retaliation to you being jerk\".\n\nESH except the youngest. \n\nHere is the thing: he is 8 and he will treat her the way he sees older people treating younger people. It would be ok to talk to him in this situation or to slightly scold him. It would be ok to tell sister to stop playing.\n\nWhat you did just reinforced the idea that stronger one can be jerk to weaker one and that is how issues are settled.", "First off pretty bad parenting that allows your younger than 10 year old siblings to play call of duty.\n\nSecondly bullying your little brother isn't teaching him shit.\n\n\nThirdly YTA", "EH, soft YTA. Instead of giving him a taste of his own medicine and causing more hostility as someone 11 years older it would have been better to explain to him she can choose to not play and reinforce her by opening the app she does want to play and supporting her if 8yo starts to scream or yell. Where are your parents during all of this?", "YTA and I have a feeling you're using this sub to validate your bullying", "YTA\n\nYou didnt teach him a lesson, you bullied him. That is not the right way to to teach your younger siblings.", "YTA\n\nNo parental controls aside: aren't you fine and mighty picking on someone 11years younger? \n\nI have a good idea why your brother thought this was a good idea.", "YTA you didn't help, you reinforced the behavior. Info how was he forcing her to play?", "YTA. Get one thing through your head. You are NOT the parent. Therefore you have no reason to be teaching your brother anything unless your actual parents have okayed it. If it was such a problem, then you should've told him it was time to play something else or diverted their attention elsewhere. Because all you did otherwise was bully him like he was doing to her. Which is just gonna reinforce that it's okay for older kids to make fun of younger ones.", "This is not teaching a lesson, although I understandwhy you frame it that way; you want validationfor your terrible behavior. This is a 19 year old being a horrible excuse for a brother. Way to go bullying a little kid, and the fact that you're so proud about it says it all. YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
