When i enter the living room I hear my younger sister (4f) getting mad. I look at her and see my younger brother (8m) next to her laughing. I see that they are playing Call of Duty Mobile. She is playing on my the ipad and he on the phone. She keeps on losing to my brother and he keeps on laughing and forcing her to play another round making her even more mad and also taunting her. I ask my sister if I can play instead of her. She agrees and I start destroying my brother, knifing, nading etc. and it gets to a point where he even starts crying. I tell that's how she feels when he plays againts her. I close the game on the ipad and open up youtube kids the app that she likes tell her to watch her favorite show instead of forcing herself playing with him. My younger brother starts screaming and telling me to keep playing with him I refuse. So Reddit am I the asshole for teaching my brother a lesson?\n\nEdit:\n\nFor everyone asking where my parents were they were in the kitchen and when they heared my younger brother crying they told me to stop bothering him and I did stop. I also did this to show him how it feels to lose against someone else I didn't taunt him and even after I told him I would stop playing against him to not make him cry even more he told 'I am not gonna cry I promise' but I stopped. Thanks for your judgment and also every time my parents delete the game he still downloads it. But some days ago he stopped playing the game. Love to you all and I accept you guys judgment. - <3\n\nLittle Side Note :\n\nI don't even play CoD that much I'm more of a Minecraft type of guy and after the whole CoD incident I took my time to show my brother a game more for his age and now he spents his time watching Minecraft on youtube or playing on the phone.

And the fact that if you google \"does exposing toddlers to violent games impact behavior\" the first thing you see is *of course it does* it makes them numb to violence, imitate the violence they've seen and have more aggressive behavior.\n\nSo as I like to say, you are the exception. Not the standard. You turned out okay but many, many other children didn't. With older kids this is less true.
