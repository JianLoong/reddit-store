Therefore, for this Christmas I decided to splurge on everyone . In particular, I spent a lot of my money on my nine year old daughter and she deserves in 100%. She has been pushing herself in school, helping around in the house without being asked, and always being the kindest soul you'll ever meet.\n\nHowever, when my mother in law came early in the morning and saw how the gifts under our tree were much more than usual she asked why. I told her I bought everyone a bunch of gifts, including her. She then preceded to ask how much gifts I got my daughter and I told her about 3 big gifts and 3 mini ones. Apparently, this outraged her because she started saying that a nine year old did not deserve that many gifts and she would be taking away the gift she bought my daughter so that my daughter wouldn't be too spoiled. I told her that was unfair especially since my mother in law promised my daughter a doll for Christmas and my daughter was looking forward for it. My mother in law said let it be a lesson to my daughter that in life she cant get all things she asks for.\n\nLook I understand that, but its not like I shower my daughter in gifts everyday. And if anything Christmas is the day you are supposed to spoil your children. But my wife told me to let it go and it was her mothers gift and therefore she could do anything she wanted with it and her mother agreed saying it was her right.\n\nAnd if we were going to play with that ideology then so be it. I decided to remove the 600$ designer bag I got my MIL, the thing I knew she wanted the most, and kept a 40$ robe instead.\n\nOnce my MIL opened her present she was disappointed asking if that was all from me, because everyone else got increasingly more expensive gifts from me. And I said yes and apologized if I disappointed her but we cant always get the gifts we hoped for.\n\nAfter this happened there was tension all day and once everyone left my wife was furious that I bought everyone things way more expensive than her mother. I explained that I did by her mom a $600 designer bag but decided against it once she took away the gift she bought my daughter.\n\nMy wife started saying I was very petty and that her mother and my daughter didn't relate. Especially since my daughter got so many gifts from me that she didn't even care that my mil didn't buy her a doll (of course my daughter wouldn't show she was upset). But my mother in law only received some cheap robe.
