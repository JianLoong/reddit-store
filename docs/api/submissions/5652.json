I told her I bought everyone a bunch of gifts, including her. She then preceded to ask how much gifts I got my daughter and I told her about 3 big gifts and 3 mini ones. Apparently, this outraged her because she started saying that a nine year old did not deserve that many gifts and she would be taking away the gift she bought my daughter so that my daughter wouldn't be too spoiled.
