Of the seven of us, six of us are very good friends and are on the swim team together. The other guy John is a cool dude but hes not really our friend. One of our buddies graduated early and we needed someone to take over his room. He\u2019s great and we\u2019re amicable but he\u2019s a little on the nerdier side so we don\u2019t have much in common with him. \n\nAnyway earlier this week John tells us that he wants to have a date night with his girlfriend to celebrate their eight year anniversary. He tells us that he wants to cook her a nice dinner. We all offer to not be in the house but John insisted that wasn\u2019t necessary because his gf is an extrovert and doesn\u2019t mind extra people. We again offered but he again insisted so we dropped it. \n\nAnyway last night was the date night and John went all out making a dinner. He and his girlfriend wore nice clothes but nothing super fancy (think khaki and polo for him and sundress for her).  They both seemed irritated by us and John quietly pulls me aside and asks for me and the other guys to change since we obviously aren\u2019t dressed up. We weren\u2019t joining them for dinner and were just talking quietly about where to go to eat (we decided that after saying hi we\u2019d leave the lovebirds to themselves) so I was confused and said no. I told the guys and they also thought it was out of line for us to be dressed up like our house was a restaurant. \n\nLater after dinner I FaceTimed my gruel friend and told her the story and she was on John and his gf\u2019s side. I\u2019m genuinely confused so can someone please explain what I did wrong and if I\u2019m TA.\n\nEDIT: Someone suggested I add what I replied to another comment so here it is\n\nAdmittedly we had just come back from working out so we didn\u2019t dress nicely. About half the guys were still in gym clothes and the guys who did shower (myself included) were either in tank tops or shirtless and in underwear while we figured out where to go, as that would affect the clothes we wore. But keep in mind we were in the living room and they were in the kitchen so they couldn\u2019t even see us unless they were deliberately looking through the doorway or over the counter.\n\nAt first I thought it was because my roommate came down in a towel but they went up to get changed a minute later and I don\u2019t think John even saw", "created_utc": 1681936107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s90sa/aita_for_not_changing_my_clothes_because_my/", "score": 348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If not, NTA obviously", "NTA\n\n>We weren\u2019t joining them for dinner and were just talking quietly about where to go to eat\n\nTheir anniversary dinner had nothing to do with y'all.", "NAH, because it's your own home. Your comments about the lack of clothes that your roommates had on, are relevant though, and should be in the post. John's request sounded weird and controlling until I saw that you were talking about a group of five or six probably-smelly, partially-clothed post-workout guys in the next room.  That's different from a quiet group in t-shirts and shorts. When he saw his gf's reaction, John was probably asking your group to put on shirts, and probably wouldn't have normally thought he'd be asking this, so didn't know how to ask in that moment.", "NTA\n\nIt's their date, not yours. You had previously offered for them to have the whole house alone. That would have been his opportunity to say, if you're going to hang around look sharp otherwise we'd prefer to be alone. Did he want you to serve them drinks also?", "NTA.  Sounds like you were being treated as NPCs.", "NTA. Not your event and no dress code required. John, his gf, and your gf are out to... um... dinner, on this one.", "NTA - If he wanted a certain feel for the night and a dress code for y'all, he should have talked to the lot of you beforehand.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You were more than nice offering to leave the house for their date night.", "NAH. While I think it's kind of ridiculous to ask you to dress more nicely in your own home because he's got a dinner date over, I think the more implied point is you all should have cleared out and left them alone even if John thought your presence would be okay at first.", "NTA this is super weird and kind of controlling.", "NTA. It\u2019s his plans, not yours. It would be different if he was throwing a party and invited you all.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t realise you guys were in your underwear?? That changes my vote to YTA. I assumed you were wearing casual clothes.", "It seems that there is a bit of a misunderstanding and miscommunication here. While John did say that his girlfriend was an extrovert and didn't mind extra people, he might have expected you all to be dressed more appropriately out of respect for their special occasion. It's possible that they felt uncomfortable with you and the other guys being in gym clothes or shirtless and in underwear while they were having a date night.\n\nThat being said, since John initially insisted that it was fine for you all to be there and didn't mention any dress code, it's understandable that you would be confused by his request. However, it may have been a good idea to compromise and at least put on more appropriate clothes for the situation, out of respect for their date night.\n\nI would say that this situation is more of a NAH (No Assholes Here) scenario. It was a misunderstanding and a lack of clear communication, but it would be a good idea to have a conversation with John to clear things up and apologize if your attire made them uncomfortable during their special night. In the future, it might be helpful to clarify expectations ahead of time to avoid similar situations.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to give them privacy. He said that was not necessary. If he had other expectations of you, he needed to say so.\n\nIt would have been better for the group to be in your room rather than in the next room, though.", "NTA", "NTA. That's a weird ass request.", "NTA  \n\n\nsounds like he may ... want the whole appartment to participate in the date???  \n\n\ni dunno its really weird that he wanted everyone to dress for the date if they were not a part of the date", "Hard NTA. It was considerate to offer to not be there and baffling he didn\u2019t take you up on it if he\u2019s concerned about this.

NTA in this case but they do have the right to feel that way, they were having a romantic date and you all were in the other room varying degrees of half naked. Could\u2019ve maybe atleast put on atleast shorts and a t-shirt.", "Don't be dressed like you're about to shoot gay porn when I have my girlfriend over really isn't an unreasonable thing to ask.", "The not-the-a voters here are young entitled men. They also tend to vote that women should do all the household laundry & that the lifestyle and belief system of a 20 year old guy is the universal human POV.\n\nOP: YTA", "IKR John is completely ridiculous. It's their home too and if they wanna hang out in the living room dressed as if they were about to shoot a gay porn video (as one does) then that's what they should do!", "This is just nitpicking the roommates words. \n\nWhat the roommate meant is that OP and others don't have to specifically make plans to stay out of the house just because he's having a date night. They can go about their day with their usual schedule. That doesn't mean that it's okay for everyone to be in gym shorts, towels and underwear. \n\nLike come on. I understand they are in the swim team and therefore it's probably okay for them to be in gym clothes a lot of times but when you have guests over you do not just show up in a speedo there. His roommate has every right to feel weird. Even if they are in a different room it's still very strange. If i was in the girls place i would be super creeped out. \n\nEven if she isn't their guest, they could be polite. \n\nI'm not sure why everyone here is so fixed in \"technicalities and actual right and wrong\" but forget to see that you live in a society and there are some societal rules that everyone should follow.", "No, if the room mate desires behaviour other than the house's norms, he must request the change instead of saying others should go about their day. It's not quibbling or nitpicking, just his words. \n\nLike come on. You can assume you know his intentions, but he well knows how his mates normally behave in the house. His words actually matter. \n\nYou can also try to prescribe behaviours everyone \"should\" follow. Given the disparate societies and cultures to which we belong, even in just North America, any such prescription is easily shown to not be universally followed - from heinous crimes to belching after a good meal. \n\nA rule for wearing a towel or underwear in a household when a guest is present? \n\nThat's sure as hell not universal, despite your desire to make it so.", "So you are saying that if the roommate wants the others to not show up in underwear in front of guests then he should specifically point it out and by not doing so it makes it okay for the guys to do so. Also, when he's finally asking to wear some clothes them choosing to say no is okay too.\n\nI would also like to know which society and culture considers it okay for one to wear underwear and towels in front of guests??  Plus even if it is societally acceptable where you live it clearly isn't where OP and his friends live. \n\nIt doesn't kill to be a little bit understanding. Especially in this situation. This honestly feels like they are trying to make their roommates life hard. Would it really have hurt them to move their discussion to a bedroom. Or for once put on some clothes. They are wearing underwear in the living room and arguing that since the gf and roommate are in the kitchen it's okay.  This is just wild.", "Well unless the guest is paying rent....", "I am indeed saying he needs to state his needs if the norm for the household is to walk around in towels, trunks or underwear, and particularly so if the girlfriend has been a regular visitor already and seen their bits under towels, trunks, and underwear. Getting pissed off at the other guys for behaving as they regularly do is bullshit. \n\nIt IS acceptable and the norm inside the house. That appears quite clear from the narrative. What happens in the outside world is irrelevant - they're all dressing to leave the house. \n\nNo, this feels like because it was a special night the girlfriend felt the rules should change from normal, got uptight and that got communicated to the rest. After they'd already offered to fully absent themselves so the duo could have the house and privacy.", "Yeah. I guess I'm the strange person because I expect people to be a little bit more aware and not everything needs to be stated word by word with all disclaimers. \n\nI honestly have no idea how any of the other roommates thought it's okay to be in underwear in front of guests but okay i guess. Personally, i would consider folks like OP very insensitive. Especially because his roommate did ask to put on some dresses as his gf is uncomfortable later on. \n\nThis whole my house my rules thing sometimes goes a little too extreme NGL.", "I'd be with you most on this one if it weren't that all of the guys were in varying states of very casual, going about their business as normal - because it is normal for them. And John has been there long enough that he would know this is routine. That's my sticking point for needing to state things. \n\nAs for casual underwear wearing... I live in a neighbourhood where folk answer their doors in t-shirts and boxers or trunks, in ratty robes (it had holes or I wouldn't call it ratty) and regularly in bra and panties. My boyfriend's neighbourhood is similarly chill and relaxed. \n\nIt's not even nudity, for goodness' sake. People who think everyone should be buttoned up and down are just wild.", "YTA. He didn\u2019t expect you to dress up all fancy, he just expected that you\u2019d actually put some clothes on. Do you always just hang around the living room in your boxers/a towel discussing where to go?  Were you just showing nerdy guy\u2019s girlfriend what she\u2019s been missing out on?", "YTA - and I\u2019m flabbergasted you don\u2019t know it. You guys owe him an apology.", "NTA. It\u2019s their date, not yours. You aren\u2019t involved and shouldn\u2019t be expected to meet their standards.", "Maybe NTA but boorish for sure.\n\nNobody asked you to dress up as though your home was a fine restaurant.  Probably your roommate thought you guys had enough class to at least be fully dressed in the public area of the place, esp. with a woman coming to visit on their special occasion.  \n\nFrom what you say, you were in various states of undress.  That is not appropriate when a guest is visiting.  You guys couldn't talk in a bedroom?  \n\nVery tacky of you.", "YTA, they wanted you to be wearing pants, for the love of God! Wear pants when you have company!!!", "NTA. Your roommate didn\u2019t tell you that he wanted you dressed in a certain way, and he also said you could go about your evening freely in what is your place.\n\nPersonally speaking if I knew someone was coming over I probably wouldn\u2019t sit in a towel or my underwear, but on the other end of that extreme I wouldn\u2019t wear a fancy outfit (given that their date wouldn\u2019t be anything to do with me). \n\nIt kind of just sounds like the roommate and his girlfriend made their plans, thought they\u2019d be fine with having everyone else there and then realised they sort of weren\u2019t. Maybe they didn\u2019t think the whole thing through as much as they should\u2019ve", "It's a typical \"Jock\" behaviour to run around more exposed since those guys spend many days being half naked with other people (swimming team), showering and changing in the lockerroom without it being weird. Maybe even at home they are fine doing it while it's just them BUT WHO THE FUCK WOULD THINK ITS APPROPRIATE WITH A GUEST BEING THERE. \n\nLiterally his own girlfriend told him that they were wrong and did something stupid, but OP went to reddit and thinks if he manipulates/changes the story enough that people would think that John really wants them to wear suits, so he might feel better about the fucking dumb thing he did. \n\nYTA all the way dude, stop lying to urself, stop justifying your dumb behaviour, John told you guys beforehand so that stuff like this wouldn't happen.", "Unless your girlfriend is into that kind of thing and you\u2019re okay with your girlfriend being into that kind of thing.", "There are still people arguing that because it\u2019s \u201cthe norm\u201d for them to be in towels, they shouldn\u2019t have to adapt their behaviour just because their roommate has a guest. The mind boggles. \n\nGod, this sub is nothing but a hate read these days.", "Not that there's anything wrong with it.", "NTA how ridiculous", "YTA. \n\nYour original post did not accurately describe the situation. I thought he was asking you to change out of normal clothes and put on semi-formal/business casual clothes. What he was actually asking, was for you to put a shirt on.", "If you were in sweats or jeans his request would have been odd, but collection of you walking around in underwear and/or without shirts would have looked really bad and quite frankly is disrespectful to his girlfriend and date night. **YTA**.", "Yta, doesn\u2019t sound like you were appropriately dressed for company being over eating dinner.  Even if it wasn\u2019t your company.", "YTA\n\nYou knew they were having a nice date and you guys were sitting around in your underwear.\n\nYou could have at least told him that you were about to leave. He probably thought you were gonna stay there dressed like that. Did he really tell you to dress up or just get dressed? I think he just wanted you to put some clothes on, any clothes.", "Is it that unreasonable to want your roommates to wear pants??", "I saw that, too! Excellent.", "This boggles my mind. So you know that John is bringing his gf over, you guys hadn't decided where to go yet...\n\nSo you decide to...what exactly? The 6 of you stand around in your boxers, IN THE LIVING ROOM no less, huddled up to discuss where to go? The hell, man? Throw some basketball shorts and a tshirt on and do that. I too like to lounge in underwear at home. In my own space. If my roommate knocks on my door, I put pants and a tshirt on to answer it. Hell, even though he's unintentionally seen me naked, it's a common courtesy.", "You sound like my friend's boyfriend, who will just waltz around the house in his briefs when he first gets up. And he just visits.\n\nYou literally have a guest in your house. It doesn't matter if \"well, I live here?\", you don't go pantless in a common area with a guest around. That's just rude af. If you're in your own room and in your underwear, have at it! You're in YOUR area.", "Its not cool but its a college dorm you don't expect people to behave"]}
