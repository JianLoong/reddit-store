Of the seven of us, six of us are very good friends and are on the swim team together. The other guy John is a cool dude but hes not really our friend. One of our buddies graduated early and we needed someone to take over his room. He\u2019s great and we\u2019re amicable but he\u2019s a little on the nerdier side so we don\u2019t have much in common with him. \n\nAnyway earlier this week John tells us that he wants to have a date night with his girlfriend to celebrate their eight year anniversary. He tells us that he wants to cook her a nice dinner. We all offer to not be in the house but John insisted that wasn\u2019t necessary because his gf is an extrovert and doesn\u2019t mind extra people. We again offered but he again insisted so we dropped it. \n\nAnyway last night was the date night and John went all out making a dinner. He and his girlfriend wore nice clothes but nothing super fancy (think khaki and polo for him and sundress for her).  They both seemed irritated by us and John quietly pulls me aside and asks for me and the other guys to change since we obviously aren\u2019t dressed up. We weren\u2019t joining them for dinner and were just talking quietly about where to go to eat (we decided that after saying hi we\u2019d leave the lovebirds to themselves) so I was confused and said no. I told the guys and they also thought it was out of line for us to be dressed up like our house was a restaurant. \n\nLater after dinner I FaceTimed my gruel friend and told her the story and she was on John and his gf\u2019s side. I\u2019m genuinely confused so can someone please explain what I did wrong and if I\u2019m TA.\n\nEDIT: Someone suggested I add what I replied to another comment so here it is\n\nAdmittedly we had just come back from working out so we didn\u2019t dress nicely. About half the guys were still in gym clothes and the guys who did shower (myself included) were either in tank tops or shirtless and in underwear while we figured out where to go, as that would affect the clothes we wore. But keep in mind we were in the living room and they were in the kitchen so they couldn\u2019t even see us unless they were deliberately looking through the doorway or over the counter.\n\nAt first I thought it was because my roommate came down in a towel but they went up to get changed a minute later and I don\u2019t think John even saw", "created_utc": 1681936107, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12s90sa/aita_for_not_changing_my_clothes_because_my/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Underwear that is not under your wear needs to be only worn that way IN YOUR BEDROOM. \n\nVery few women would feel relaxed in the environment you guys were setting.

Asking you to wear pants is not the same thing as asking you to put on a three piece suit.", "This is so odd, like they wanted you all to dress up as patrons to this imaginary restaurant lol  \nNTA  \nAnd I'd pry into why your gf is on their side because that's so weird and I wanna know why she doesn't see it that way lol", "INFO: was there something off about the clothes you were wearing?  If not, NTA obviously", "NTA\n\n>We weren\u2019t joining them for dinner and were just talking quietly about where to go to eat\n\nTheir anniversary dinner had nothing to do with y'all.", "NAH, because it's your own home. Your comments about the lack of clothes that your roommates had on, are relevant though, and should be in the post. John's request sounded weird and controlling until I saw that you were talking about a group of five or six probably-smelly, partially-clothed post-workout guys in the next room.  That's different from a quiet group in t-shirts and shorts. When he saw his gf's reaction, John was probably asking your group to put on shirts, and probably wouldn't have normally thought he'd be asking this, so didn't know how to ask in that moment.", "NTA\n\nIt's their date, not yours. You had previously offered for them to have the whole house alone. That would have been his opportunity to say, if you're going to hang around look sharp otherwise we'd prefer to be alone. Did he want you to serve them drinks also?", "NTA.  Sounds like you were being treated as NPCs.", "NTA. Not your event and no dress code required. John, his gf, and your gf are out to... um... dinner, on this one.", "NTA - If he wanted a certain feel for the night and a dress code for y'all, he should have talked to the lot of you beforehand.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You were more than nice offering to leave the house for their date night.", "NAH. While I think it's kind of ridiculous to ask you to dress more nicely in your own home because he's got a dinner date over, I think the more implied point is you all should have cleared out and left them alone even if John thought your presence would be okay at first.", "NTA this is super weird and kind of controlling.", "NTA. It\u2019s his plans, not yours. It would be different if he was throwing a party and invited you all.", "It seems that there is a bit of a misunderstanding and miscommunication here. While John did say that his girlfriend was an extrovert and didn't mind extra people, he might have expected you all to be dressed more appropriately out of respect for their special occasion. It's possible that they felt uncomfortable with you and the other guys being in gym clothes or shirtless and in underwear while they were having a date night.\n\nThat being said, since John initially insisted that it was fine for you all to be there and didn't mention any dress code, it's understandable that you would be confused by his request. However, it may have been a good idea to compromise and at least put on more appropriate clothes for the situation, out of respect for their date night.\n\nI would say that this situation is more of a NAH (No Assholes Here) scenario. It was a misunderstanding and a lack of clear communication, but it would be a good idea to have a conversation with John to clear things up and apologize if your attire made them uncomfortable during their special night. In the future, it might be helpful to clarify expectations ahead of time to avoid similar situations.", "NTA\n\nYou offered to give them privacy. He said that was not necessary. If he had other expectations of you, he needed to say so.\n\nIt would have been better for the group to be in your room rather than in the next room, though.", "NTA", "NTA. That's a weird ass request.", "NTA  \n\n\nsounds like he may ... want the whole appartment to participate in the date???  \n\n\ni dunno its really weird that he wanted everyone to dress for the date if they were not a part of the date", "Hard NTA. It was considerate to offer to not be there and baffling he didn\u2019t take you up on it if he\u2019s concerned about this. You being there includes the spectrum of normal, non-disruptive behavior you\u2019d do around the house. That includes wearing any normal clothes.", "Holy shit, man. You\u2019re not even in the AH universe you\u2019re so far away from being TA. \n\nThat\u2019s absolutely bonkers to expect your roommates to dress nicely for a dinner they have no part in, while in their own damn home, nonetheless. \n\nNTA times a million.", "NTA. Tell them your tuxedos are at the cleaners.", "NTA. If I was the girl maybe The towel guy might have been awkward???? But you guys are not on the date. He is strange.", "NTA you offered to be out, which was really sweet. He declined and mentioned nothing about dress at the time. It's not like you showed up to a restaurant with a dress code and refused to change. You simply existed in your own home.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA.  What does he expect in a share house of so many guys.", "NTA. Wtf, are you supposed to put on a butler costume and serve them the fucking food too? Sing 'Be Our Guest' from beauty and the beast. Wtf.", "NAH. Obviously John was out of line but it sounds like he was trying to create this romantic atmosphere for his girlfriend but didn't want to inconvenience anyone else and he didn't really communicate that or think ahead. Of course that's just if he made the request once a d then dropped it", "Shared housing always means compromise. Asking the residents to \u2018dress up\u2019 for their date is silly.", "YTA. What an edit. Shirtless or in underwear? Come on.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m confused as to why there was any expectation that you and your friends would be \u201cdressed\u201d for an anniversary dinner you were not taking part in.
