Maybe offer him money in exchange for doing chores around the house with the understanding that the money he makes at first goes towards paying his brother back. Not only will this allow your older son to work for the money he wants/needs but it\u2019ll also discourage him from borrowing from his brother as when he does chores he\u2019ll want the money himself and won\u2019t want to constantly be paying off his debts to his brother. \n\nAs a younger brother who looks up a ton to my older brothers it would\u2019ve been heartbreaking to have \u201cspending time with me\u201d be their punishment and would absolutely hurt me a ton so please consider this in regards to your younger son.

He's an asshole just like his dad.", "Wait wait wait\u2026 Justin is working for you\u2026 therefore YOU pay off his debt to the brother. That\u2019s the whole point of him babysitting ??", "Did you give him a deadline to pay him back? Babysitting doesn't just magically replace the money he owes.", "INFO: your 19 year old unemployed son is stealing from your 8 year old son. Why are you allowing him to stay in your house? That is unbelievably predatory.", "I honestly just assumed when I first read it that OP surely MUST mean that he'd be using the money he'd be paying for babysitting to pay back Blake. And that's before OP even had the audacity to claim (lie) that this was how Justin would be paying back his loans.\n\nWithout there being any exchange of money, forcing your child to take full responsibility for their young sibling and doing everything from cooking to bathing to getting ready for school, MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK? That's called parentification.", "You can not raise a perfect kid", "Classic reddit lol", "Paying off the act of taking advantage of his brother", "Yeah OP is misleading in his post. Justin isn\u2019t paying his loans off, he\u2019s just being punished on top of still owing his brother money.", "Yeah OP is being very misleading in the original post.", "Asking him to babysit Blake doesn't at all guarantee he won't still financially abuse him.\n\nBlake still is missing money and isn't getting paid back.\n\nAre you planning on paying Blake back yourself? \n\nBlake needs to be made whole somehow.\n\nHonestly you're coming off as a very problematic parent here.\n\nYTA", "Sure, Jan.", "The hell? No. No he won't. How does babysitting guarantee he will stop asking for money. If anything the fact there are no adults home means that Justin will be able to manipulate Blake more and take his money. This is worse for Blake and isn't gonna help him. Step up and do your job.", "Cool.  How does THAT pay him back?  \n\n\nIf I owe you 100 dollars, and I stop asking you for money, did I give you 100 dollars?    \n\n\nOlder brother financially abuses younger brother, dad gets free babysitting, and all the kid that got conned out of his cash gets is the message that his brother spending time with him is a punishment.  \n\n\nFucking awesome.   \n\n\nYTA, but honestly that should go without saying at this point.", "To teach him a lesson", "You're not even trying.", "Not the way you're \"doing\" it!", "You\u2019re just a shitty parent who wants to get out of raising their kid and pushing him off to the Devil spawn of yours! YTA op", "You can definitely raise them better so they don't think borrowing money from a kid half their age and not paying them back is just ok to do.", "This makes absolutely no sense.", "That doesn't even make sense... you want him to pay the money back, which is reasonable. However, you also want him to babysit to pay of the act of taking advantage of his brother. You do realise this is more punishing poor Blake, because all this is gonna do is put the older son in a crap mood, and probably make the night miserable for Blake. Ngl there's no logic here except free babysitting for *you*", "If you want Justin to spend quality time with Blake to make up for taking advantage of him, making him babysit for free isn\u2019t the way to do it. While Blake might like spending time with Justin, I\u2019m sure he would prefer doing something fun with him rather than everyday care tasks that are your responsibility as the parent. Not to mention, because Justin is being forced into this situation, he\u2019ll probably feel frustrated and conflict between them is likely to occur. It\u2019s fine to encourage Justin to do something fun with his brother (Eg. Playing a sport, going to the park, going out for dinner, going to an arcade, etc.), but forcing him to babysit for free out of punishment isn\u2019t going to help their relationship.", "And what lesson is that exactly?"]}
