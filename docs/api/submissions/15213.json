Maybe offer him money in exchange for doing chores around the house with the understanding that the money he makes at first goes towards paying his brother back. Not only will this allow your older son to work for the money he wants/needs but it\u2019ll also discourage him from borrowing from his brother as when he does chores he\u2019ll want the money himself and won\u2019t want to constantly be paying off his debts to his brother. \n\nAs a younger brother who looks up a ton to my older brothers it would\u2019ve been heartbreaking to have \u201cspending time with me\u201d be their punishment and would absolutely hurt me a ton so please consider this in regards to your younger son.

If you aren\u2019t paying Blake the rate you would pay Justin for Justin to work off his loan, it\u2019s a bit opportunistic. Additionally, you aren\u2019t doing Blake any favors. More alone time with Justin = more opportunities for Justin to take money from Blake. \n\nI understand some cases can\u2019t be helped and it\u2019s necessary for some families, but when it\u2019s not kids shouldn\u2019t have to watch their siblings regularly for their parents to live their lives. They have feelings too. Every now and then is one thing, and it can be a great tool for teaching responsibility, but the amount of responsibility you are placing on Justin shouldn\u2019t be what a parent would do. Watching movies and ordering a pizza, sure. But bathing, making dinner, and getting him ready for school? Older siblings are not built in babysitters and step in parents.", "How is this helping Blake?

He is only 8 and will get a valuable lesson for life at an early age without huge financial impact. \n\nAll the options seem to result Blake becoming a cynical human being. \n\nOP, just make Justin get an actual job to pay Blake back. Put Blakes money in the bank until Justin has paid back every penny he owes. Perhaps it will motivate Blake to take action before he gets hurt.", "I don't think OP needs a babysitter. That's not the point. I think OP's intention is that, since he knows Justin has no intention of paying Blake back and he doesn't want to meddle/tell Blake he can't lend out his money, that he wants Justin  to spend quality time with the younger brother who worships him and gives him cash.  Kind of like...

My mom was financially abusive, and I had some \"money hoarding\" problems like Blake.  I didn't realize until I was older that I felt the need to horde money because my mom was so irresponsible with money.\n\nWhen a parent has an unhealthy trait or habit, it usually gets reflected in one of two ways with the kids.  1. The child will imitate the parent's habit (Justin lies and makes up sob stories about why he doesn't have money.  Somehow Justin doesn't have lunch money, something that he should be getting from dad.) 2.  The child overcompensates to avoid the unhealthy habit. (Blake hordes his money.)\n\nWhy doesn't dad pay Justin for babysitting?  Why doesn't Justin have lunch money?

You are literally modeling the behavior for Justin you want to extinguish.", "1. He's already in the middle.\n2. You aren't being real honest with yourself about not wanting to put Blake in the middle because you're putting him into a vulnerable position by forcing his older brother to provide parental level care for him which will cause resentment in Justin that blows back on Blake.

There were never any issues with money in the home and his twin wasn\u2019t like that at all.
