He came home an hour later than he said he would, completely plastered. \n\nWe have a two year old daughter, who was very excited to see him. He very nearly dropped her in the kitchen sink, made an awful mess of dirty dishwasher in the kitchen and on our daughter. He then proceeded to demand our daughter get in her high chair to eat cheerios (she wanted to eat them while cuddling with him and watching paw patrol). When our daughter didn\u2019t want to comply, he ate the cheerios in front of her and laughed when she screamed and cried. \n\nTrying to be fair here, she had already eaten and the cheerios were just a snack, but still. \n\nI kicked him out of our house, and called his dad to come get him so he wouldn\u2019t drive drunk. I love him very much and he\u2019s normally a fabulous parent to our daughter, but I didn\u2019t want her to see him like that, and, frankly, I don\u2019t have the emotional capacity to deal with his behavior tonight. \n\nI feel sort of badly now, so, AITA for sticking to my guns and sending him to his parents\u2019 house to sleep it off?\n\nEdited to add and give a small update (9:37 am next day):\n\n1. I had no reason to believe he was plastered at 7:30 in the evening. I didn\u2019t realize he was drunk until he stepped into the room I was in and I could smell the alcohol (whiskey). He doesn\u2019t drink like that often (one to two times per year MAYBE) and no one in this house has any type of alcohol open or available before our daughter goes to bed. \n\n2. I didn\u2019t immediately jump to calling my in laws. I dislike imposing on them for anything. My own parents live literally five states away, so they weren\u2019t an option. I did call his best friend first, but he was out of town and couldn\u2019t help me. \n\n3. For every sexist fucking prick who\u2019s asking me who pays the bills and stuff, we spilt them based on salary, and guess what, jackasses, I pay (significantly) more because I make (significantly) more. Take that shit out of here and reevaluate yourself and your worldview. \n\n4. Small update: I read him the riot act this morning, let him know what he did (it was clear to me he didn\u2019t remember). He was properly contrite and ashamed of himself, and apologized profusely (and sincerely) to both me and to our daughter. Since this was literally the first time this has happened, I\u2019m going to choose to believe this was a lapse (albeit serious lapse) in judgement. Reevaluation will occur if this happens again. He did say that I was right to call his dad, he wasn\u2019t in a frame of mind to listen to me, and was extremely grateful I didn\u2019t tell his mother (who would have come down on him like a ton of bricks for his treatment of her only grandchild, drunk or not). \n\nThanks to everyone who gave me extra perspective on this, I probably would not have been as vehement or harsh in my reading of the riot act this morning if I hadn\u2019t had the additional insight from you folks.", "created_utc": 1691197770, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ihsha/aita_for_having_my_husbands_father_come_get_him/", "score": 3259, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was 7 years old and couldn't wake him up, so I just got myself ready and woke him up when it was time to leave. he screamed at me that it was daylight savings time (it wasn't) and finally brought me in 2 hours later. alcoholic dad memories aren't fun. he doesn't even remember any of this now", "You wouldn\u2019t do shit. \ud83d\ude44", "Purposely eating their food I  front of the while laughing as they cry is not fighting with your kids to do basic things 101...\n\nIt is emotional abuse.\n\nI read her updates and I truly hope he realizes he cannot be around his child that drunk ever again.", "It doesn't sound like this guy is an alcoholic.
