Probably.

It\u2019s good you kicked him out until he sobers up. \n\nWhen he returns, a long conversation with your husband is needed. He should not be around your child when he is that drunk.  Good luck!", "NTA. Good move for protecting your daughters image of her father. I\u2019m sure he will understand and appreciate when he sobers up and reflects.", "NTA. Your biggest responsibility as a parent is to protect your child. She could\u2019ve been seriously hurt in this situation.", "NTA he sounds like he was being a danger to himself and others", "NTA.

Drunkenness lasts awhile so yeah; I like your solution.", "You seem to be utterly downplaying that he was abusive to your daughter.   \n\n\nI know it's why you called the father to get him but at the same time you are downplaying it far too much. \n\nNTA but really consider wtf he did with your child while drunk.", "NTA.
