This 100%. My dad was a heavy drinker, and I have to say that when he got drunk, he had little ability to discern when \"fun\" had crossed over into something else entirely.

Just general rough-housing that was too rough to be fun for me. No one knew it at the time, but I had a connective tissue disorder with severe joint hypermobility - my finger and toe joints were among the few that did not pop easily or willingly, and it was genuinely very painful. To this day, I flinch and pull away when someone grabs my toes or fingers. I am 35!

The small daughter doesn't want to be interacted with like that, so good on her for recognizing her distress and putting an end to it. If dad could control himself and just head to bed and sleep it off at home it would be one thing, but it sounds like that wasn't the case.
