Not even a call to congratulate her. Conversely, you could have told him earlier to either be there for his kid or not. Ask your daughter, explain the situation, and let her decide. The problem is if you decide for her she will blame you for potential contact loss with her dad. I saw in a comment that your daughter is only 4 but I think she is capable to decide this.", "NTA but I would consider taking her. I get why you feel the way you do and rightfully so. However this could be fun and memorable for your daughter. I know it\u2019s sucks but I\u2019d say be the bigger person.", "ESH. She\u2019s now at an age she will understand and remember. Yes, what he did sucks. But it\u2019s still nice for your daughter to have this party thrown for her. I understand how you feel but if you don\u2019t take her she\u2019s the person missing out most.", "Unless it's your ex's scheduled time with her custody wise, NTA.  If the ex and the ex family really cared they'd make an effort. Clearly, your daughter is an after thought for them and not a priority.", "NTA. Dad want his daughter to have a birthday party, he can pick her up. \n  You should throw a birthday party for her. Not invite any from the Ex's side.", "I'm going to go with a very sympathetic ESH based on what you've said. \n\nYeah, they didn't need to share the birthday parties between cousins. But for her own dad to not even recognise her birthday? Absolutely bizarre behaviour.\n\nThe only reason I'm including you in the ESH is because even though they're acting like trash, I feel like  your daughter would benefit more from at least having SOME acknowledgement of her birthday having passed by her dad, than none at all.", "NTA\nThese people don't care about her. Surround her with people who love her and don't treat her like she's second class.", "As someone who has been the child in this situation, YWBTA. Or, not an asshole - but making a decision I think your daughter would grow to feel hurt by when she was older. She's young, at four she doesn't understand the concept of proving a point or lateness or setting boundaries - she understands that she has a dad, and a birthday and a party. When she's a bit older you might be able to have a real conversation wit her about the fact she's entitled to respect from him and that she can draw lines when she doesn't feel prioritised etc but at the moment she's at an age where the best you can do is try and make things feel normal for her, and normal is going to your birthday and seeing your dad.", "ESH\n\nYour daughter is 4 ... for 3 years your ex\u2019s family has not acknowledged her birthday in any way? Why?? And why have you continued to allow Dad to get away with this behavior? Every year you have brought cousin a gift & every year their family has done nothing?? Why is this happening?? Why are you worried about cousin\u2019s kid\u2019s birthday on your daughter\u2019s birthday?\n\nThere\u2019s never a good reason to not celebrate a child\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s your daughter. She is the person who is missing out & you are creating a relationship with ex\u2019s family that is not acceptable. Do what\u2019s best for your daughter! Do your job! Advocate for your daughter! Work together with your ex to give your daughter all the love & support she needs... from her entire family.", "NTA\n\nYour ex on the other hand is an enormously huge one. Your ex's family clearly didn't want your daughter to be there, or care about your daughter at all. Taking a kid to a party where she isn't welcommed wouldn't do her any good. You did the right thing.", "NTA I would say.\n\nUsually I would say what your daughter wants is most important and you should never ever weaponize your kid in a divorce or alienate the other parent. But in this case (from what I know) I don't think you're doing either of that. You seem like you want him to be involved and present in her live and be a father.... just yeah, he already fails. And I would actually set your daughters wishes back this time to prove a point. \n\nOf course she will say yes to the party because she is four and doesn't understand whats going on, but I think if you accept her fathers behaviour this time it will never get better and you are going to do your daughter a disservice in the long run.\n\nHe will think what he's doing is fine because he got through with it and never make an effort. He needs to know that his choices and actions have consequences and he learns it better right away then later when your daughter is old enough to understand and be hurt and disappointed.", "It's really hard on both you and your daughter and I don't think you're an AH at all. My daughter is in the same situation - her daughter's dad only wants to know once in a blue moon then makes all sorts of unreasonable demands. So he didn't see her for 18 months, then turned up on Christmas Day at my house, with a totally inappropriate and expensive present, demanding to see his daughter. It's horrible for my granddaughter to be used like this at his own convenience.\n\nHowever, your daughter won't understand the politics behind it, or even the significance of the date. Take her to the party, let her enjoy it without comment.\n\nTrust me, she will understand in time what her father's like, unless he improves. She will only resent you if he has the right to say 'your mother wouldn't let me see you.' Don't give him that ammo.", "Tbh we haven't talked about it too much. She's 4, so of course she wants to go to a party, but she was also upset that she didn't get to see her dad, and that \"cousin got a party and I didn't\". It also didn't help that we only stayed for a few minutes, because we weren't invited, so naturally she was upset. If it were a one time thing I'd be whatever, but this is the 3rd year in a row that I've put up with the blatant favoritism and gave on, though I have spoken with him about it in years past.", "If you're suggesting a 4 year old decide this I really have to think you don't have kids.  The kid will pick the party.\n\nMy daughter at 8 was invited to a party of a kid in her class who constantly makes fun of her.  Guess what?  She wanted to go.  Even when I talked to her and pointed out how the girl made her cry the week before, it didn't matter.  All my daughter cared about was that there was a party and she wanted to go.  Parents need to make this decision, kids are not mature enough to.", "I'll keep that in mind, thanks for reading the long post.", ">She\u2019s now at an age she will understand and remember.\n\nShe won't. Tell me any memory from when you were four.\n\n>But it\u2019s still nice for your daughter to have this party thrown for her.\n\nYou kidding? It wasn't thrown for her. It was, \"Shit, did you forget too that Tony had a kid with that chick Tiffany? I guess we have to throw a separate party for her now.\" They did it as an afterthought, as by OP's description they don't care about her daughter at all.", "They haven't been willing to make an effort in 4 years. Doesn't seem like that's going to change.", "Damn dude, you didn't even read the initial post.", ">Work together with your ex to give your daughter all the love & support she needs... from her entire family.\n\nYou kidding? She clearly explained how the family tries to be as absent of the kid's life as possibly. What should she do? Force the daughter on the grandparents and father who clearly don't want anything to do with her? And you think the kid spending time with people that clearly don't want her is somehow her interest?", "So you're saying I should not take her to the party, correct?", "I posted the same thing. Anyway.", "Sorry, but that's on you. It's the third year it's happened, what were you thinking? Her Dad's a deadbeat which means you have to step up and make all the decisions for her. Seems like you are trying to be the victim here. Your daughter is.\n\nYTA", "I have LOTS of memories from when I was 4. I remember my birthday, first day at school. Lots of school memories. Holidays etc.", "Honestly I was reading up on that literally yesterday the majority of people start rapidly losing memories of their childhood by age of 7, so technically she's going to remember it but like only for a couple more years unless they add so much extra bullshit on top of the singular event so it leaves a traumatic imprint.", "I had my tonsils out and the doctors pretended to put my doll under anesthesia. I had just started school and I remember being away and coming back. Kid's remember things that impact their lives, even 4 year olds.", "I\u2019m saying you should do everything you can to allow your child to see & celebrate with her Dad whenever. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be punished because the adults are making bad choices. You & your ex need to get on the same page with parenting. It\u2019s not acceptable for your daughter to miss out because the adults don\u2019t want to make an effort. \n\nThere\u2019s no purpose for not allowing her to have a relationship with her Dad. If that means you have to remind Dad every year or invite everyone to your house for birthday, then do it! A child can never have too many people who love them in their life. \n\nHowever, I think it\u2019s incredibly bizarre that cousin never mentioned they were having a birthday party at the park when you called for her address. Why would she tell you to meet them there if they weren\u2019t intending on inviting your daughter? If ex\u2019s family is intentionally trying to hurt your daughter, then it\u2019s your job to protect her.", "So you think I shouldn't take her to the party, is what you're saying.", "I respectfully disagree with your second paragraph. He's an adult, older than me, I don't need to remind him that he has a child he needs to see. He knows. If he does somehow forget, he has a neice that is also a living reminder. Also, why would I urge my daughter to yearn and miss and want a relationship with a person who needs to be reminded that she exists? That would be doing her more harm than good. When she wants to see him she does, she just never asks for him because she never sees them.", "It's not bizarre. They don't view them as family. I do agree the Ex's family turns the screws on the situation.", "Um, yes.", "You\u2019re both adults so it\u2019s each of your responsibility to figure out what is best for your daughter. If you think Dad shouldn\u2019t be in your daughter\u2019s life, then don\u2019t do anything. She will eventually understand that both parents have the power to make decisions. Hopefully, she will feel that everyone tried their best for her well-being. \n\nI think you\u2019re setting a very bad precedent that will negatively affect your daughter\u2019s life. Her Dad missing her birthday every year will do nothing but hurt your daughter. That should be the last thing you ever want for her.", "Oh, so you're a right fighter. At the expense of your own child. Nice. not.", "Then your rating is wrong. It's WIBTA if I didn't take her. If you think I shouldn't take her, it's NTA. I agree with everything you said though, I need to grow a backbone to them for my daughter.", "OP you need to realise that if you take your daughter to that party then you will be enabling them for what they are doing to your daughter. What kind of a parent doesn't even text or call their child on their birthday, it's not that he forgot, he very well knew and was attending another birthday. To me this whole, we're going to have a small party for her on XYZ day sounds like a poor attempt to make up for his f'up. \n\nNTA. Set boundaries so that your daughter isn't treated like an outsider in her own family. Tell him that it's too late to celebrate her birthday this year and he should make efforts next year.", "Why don't you throw a party for your daughter, and invite everyone?  Coordinate that it is not at the same day/time as the cousin's.", "ESH. Yes, your ex is a jerk who forgot to acknowledge his own daughter's birthday until you reminded him of her existence. But your daughter is too young to care when her birthday is celebrated, and what she will remember is that she got to go to a party and eat cake and see her father. This is one of those moments where as a divorced parent, you choke down your feelings for your kid's sake.", "INFO: So these last-minute parties for your daughter have happened before.  In your experience, is there a noticeable difference between them and cousin's?  Other than last minute I mean.  Like, I'm assuming cousin had the pavilion at the park all decorated and a big cake with her name and pizza and a table full of presents and a bunch of kids running around playing together.  For your daughter, are you expecting to hang out in your ex's living room for an hour with some family, eat packaged cupcakes from Walmart, while your daughter opens some Dollar Tree presents?  Or will the family do something similar to what cousin had?", "NTA tell them to pound sand. It's pretty clear where your daughter comes in their priorities, even her fathers", "Soft YTA. This situation can only hurt your daughter just to be petty. We don't fight fire with fire, we fight it with water.", "This is basically what I was going to say, though I am also curious to know if OP planned anything for her daughter's birthday and if she invited the dad to be part of the planning?", "Doubt this guy has any custody. Someone who rolls with his daughter being excluded from her cousin's party isn't someone who is going to fight to spend time with his daughter.\n\nDid SIL have no shame asking OP to drop off a gift to the actual party and then not ask OP/her daughter to stay?? SIL should have been properly embarrassed and said no gift was necessary or set up an alternate time for the gift exchange.\n\nThe dad's family is inconsiderate at best, down right mean at worst. Probably best to let that relationship fade and not take daughter to the party. NTA.", "I totally agree with you I also wrote a comment stating that if OP decides to not let them celebrate her b-day she takes memories and maybe the contact with her dad away from her kid and now a mom is trying to tell me that the world will basically end if a kid decides something lmao.", "\"You are creating a relationship with ex's family that is not acceptable\" Nope they did that when excluding and ignoring the daughter for 3 birthdays straight.", "All of my family lives in another state. I've been doing it at one year, we go to the other state for her bday, and the other we stay here so that his family can have her on her birthday, though they haven't utilized it. I sent him a reminder about a month before the date that it was his year to have a party for her, but he never responded. I also tried to schedule a get together Shortly after her birthday last year, because she was in another state at the time, but I he never responded to that either.", "I don't think it's her job to include him in anything in regards to her party or parenting time.", "So you think choosing for your kid is better and eventually, in a few years your kid will hate you because she doesn't have contact with her dad. Because you chose for them. Nice one. \n\nEDIT: yes I don't have kids since I'm only 17 years old but I would have appreciated it if my mom asked me for my opinion when I was younger. BTW. you clearly didn't read the comments because OP said that her daughter is upset about the fact that her dad did not talk to her on her B-day so she understands the circumstances.", "I remember visiting my great-grandmother and sitting on her bed with her talking with me.  She died when I was 4 1/2.", "It really depends on the person. I have lots of memories from when I was four. We moved the next year so there's a very clear before/after for me and can be sure how old I was", "I'd stop alternating if I were you, because it clearly isn't working. Perhaps it would work better if you claim the weekend of her birthday each year and take her for a party with your family then and give her dad the choice between the weekend before or after her birthday to celebrate with her? That way she always has a birthday weekend, no matter what her dad does, and there is no interference from the cousin's birthday for whatever he does plan.", "That's interesting. If the situation were in a vacuum, and it's his year to host a party but you're not letting her go because he hasn't been communicative with you about it until this point I'd say you should let her go. \n\nBut you've clearly been trying for years to include him and he's not been interested. I mean, even if he had planned a party for her in advance, to give nothing on the day of her actual birthday, not even a text, is heinous. I wonder why he suddenly wants to have a party for her? Like, did he just pluck the idea out of thin air when he saw you to save face? Has he been planning it for a while and intentionally keeping you in the dark? If so, why? \n\nNone of this affects my judgement btw, you're NTA. But I can see this becoming an ongoing issue with birthdays, holidays, and just general custody time if you can't get to the bottom of it. \n\nI'm so sorry for your daughter. I know it must be hard to see her not cared for by her paternal family in the same way her cousins are. I hope something changes soon for her.", "I think it wouldn't have been a big deal to have the party at another date if he communicated and planned it beforehand and not only started talking about it after you confronted him. Now it just looks like an excuse.\n\nAnd he didn't even call her for her birthday! If he really had to go to the nieces party there would have been so many compromises, like seeing his daughter in the morning for a birthday breakfast for example.\n\nBut this guy clearly neither is interested nor makes an effort.\n\nThe \"birthday party\" they want to throw now looks more like something he doesn't want to do but has to to save what little face he has left.", "First off, I didn't say what to choose.  Second, if kid doesn't have contact with dad (based on this post) its because dad went MIA again, not because she didn't go to 1 party.  Third, yes, I'll choose for my kid, cause I'm the parent and thats how that works.  Just like I choose that they go to school, and clean their room, and eat their dinner.  It's called responsible parenting.  To many parents nowadays want to be their kids friend instead of their parent.  \"All she'll eat is cake and Captain Crunch so thats what I fix for meals 3 times a day.  Look what a good mom I am, my kid loves me.  Who gives a rat butt that her teeth are rotted out cause she doesn't brush them either cause it's her choice!\"  Give me a break.", "Also this comment is kinda confusing. You're saying I need work with him to maintain and relationship between them, while also acknowledging that his family (and him) is intentionally making it difficult. Not only that, there seems to be the assumption that I don't want them to have a relationship. I do, if it's consistent, but the disappearing for months and months at a time only to show up and spend 30 minutes love bombing her is unhealthy, is it not? He lives 4 minutes away from me, there's no excuse. This is also the first time I've considered saying no to them, in 4 years. I think what's best for my daughter is to keep context minimal, at this point.", "Right like once again people blaming the mom for lack of contact when that is 100% the dad's fault. Unless the dad is on house arrest permanently, it is his decision to contact her or not. Crazy how people always blame the mom", "WOW ok if you think so. I actually don't really care since it was MY opinion but you do you.", "Damn straight OP!! Good on you for standing up to wrong ratings. Definitely YWNBTA. They don't care about her, have your own little party. No more second citizenship for her. If her father's side actually wants her they'll apologize and try to do better.", "NTA and I would let them set up the date and time, and then when they are ready to party, you have a party elsewhere with your side of the family and not tell your ex. \n\nBut that is just me being petty... agree to disagree?", "NTA - if a 4yo's birthday is worth celebrating, then surely he should celebrate HIS 4yo's birthday.\n\nWhen he said 'we're gonna do a little party for our daughter on Thursday' was this him remembering to invite his side of the family to a party that had already been agreed or was it him inventing a last minute party and creating something for YOU to organise.\n\nIt sounds as though his family are allergic to OP and OPs daughter doesn't see these relatives as a consequence of this.  \n\nthe Ex didn't want to say 'we dont have the joint party now because my family don't like you any more'.  Inviting OP to stop by a party she wasn't invited to was part of the EX's family making this clear", "NTA.\n\nShe's four. She's not stupid. My brother and I were very aware of our dad not showing up for every holiday or birthday when we were that little. At least he'd freaking *call* from whatever shithole truck stop he got snowed in at. He would sing happy birthday to me over the phone. He would try to schedule a make up visit as soon as possible.\n\nYour ex just doesn't care to make an effort. *She has already noticed he's not there*, I assure you. She's going to get to the point where she won't want him there. \n\nAll you're doing at this point is protecting your kid from her undependable father's choices. His unreliable behavior is not on you to try and make up for.", "NTA. Just make sure you document the heck out of everything just in case they try to turn this around on you when your kid is older. Write a diary entry about it, or some thing, something you can show her later, if they try some revisionist history bull crap in years to come. Like saying \u201c your mother wouldn\u2019t let us throw you a birthday party, we were so heartbroken.\u201d", "NTA they've made no effort and 'daddy' couldn't even be bothered? keep your daughter with people who will treasure her.", "NTA, but why are you a delivery service?   Make him come and get her if he wants to be her Dad.  It's your day off.", "INFO\n       \nWhat is the point of not taking her? I can understand why you don't want to take her, but I'm not 100% sure I understand the value to her of not going.  \n        \nHer father not caring about her is something she is going to figure out as she gets older.

Don't sugar coat it and don't cover for them. \"We invite the WHOLE family; but sometimes people have other plans and can't make it\" reinforce this as she gets older. \"We invited them; they couldn't make it\" she'll piece it together as she gets older that they are choosing not to attend.", "Nta and plan a party next year and invite everyone but not that side of the family.

Would they care whether it's tacky or relatively inconsiderate compared to their cousin? No. They want cake, balloons, presents and family. You're deciding against that based on principle, which I get, but I can't see how it's what your daughter would ultimately want.", "YWBTA - totally agree with this comment. If you don\u2019t let her go to the party they are throwing for her, your ex might try to use that against you. That could be badmouthing you to your daughter or with the courts/custody arrangement. You don\u2019t have to make her dad seem like a saint for any crumb of involvement, but if you don\u2019t let her go to the party then you\u2019ll get the blame from her and from your ex. \n\nIt sucks that you\u2019re the one that has to comfort her when your ex and his family don\u2019t show any interest in her except for when it suits them. Because of your care and consistency, even at 4 your daughter knows that you are the one that\u2019s there for her and that understanding will grow as she gets older. \n\nSome of the comments are suggesting you don\u2019t let her go to the party to teach your ex a lesson. Don\u2019t use your daughter as a pawn. You don\u2019t have to be a doormat either. If you don\u2019t have a custody arrangement in place, it might be time to get one. Let her go to the party and take some time to think about your boundaries and do your best to communicate these to your ex and your daughter. I know he\u2019s not responding to your texts, but still do your due diligence and keep records of communication between you two.", "Agree with this. Unfortunately, it's not going to take very long for daughter to figure out just how little she matters to dad and his family. She's got years and years ahead of her to be disappointed in her family. But right now, while she still has that innocence, let her enjoy the party, the presents, the small bit of attention she'll get at this belated party. \n\nAnd don't give them ammunition to hold against you, OP.   \n\n\nStill going with NTA vote, though, because you care so much.", "You should never let your daughter normalize being an afterthought by anyone, especially not \u201cfamily\u201d.", "Last-minute party? Dad extended the invite to OP and his daughter after 4pm *on the daughters bday* to a bday party for that was going to be held for her *the next Thursday*. And while at a party for his niece, who has the exact same birthday.\n\nNo, that is not \"last minute\". At that point, last minute would be trying to invite them to go to dinner with him and some of the family *that night*.\n\nThis was a metaphorical brown-shorts moment of realizing, when he saw OP and his daughter, that he'd completely forgotten her... **again**. And still trying to kick the can down the road a few days... It was after the last minute.\n\nAnd you can almost guarantee that it was going to be a small in-home thing, at least at the point that he extended the invite.", "I think it\u2019s the niece\u2019s party which got postponed due to weather they\u2019re holding, not OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s. That why for me, NTA.", "Ok reread it yes she already had a party. I still stick to her not helping nor bring child to dad's. If dad wants to throw a small party then it is up to him. He is only doing out of guilt. If OP didn't stop at the park it would not have entered Dad's pie sized brain.", "I know it\u2019s hard. You love your child with every fiber of your being and I would be so mad too (I can sort of relate because my parents have never been to one of my daughters birthdays and so has my brother and they are the only family we have). But not going would probably cut ties with the whole family. And that would impact her a lot.", "OK, I think that needs to stop. He's your ex; stop trying to facilitate things with his family. That needs to be your ex's job. Plan parties on your end with your family or her friends as she gets older every year on your time. If he has a solid custody agreement, it needs to be your ex doing things with his family on his time. If you guys do not have a solid custody agreement, it's actually in both you and your daughters best interest to do.\n\nHonestly, your daughter is eventually going to notice his family's attitude towards her. Just be there for her when she does", "Thanks for pointing that out. I reread it and it\u2019s a bit confusing. Now I\u2019m not sure which party was rescheduled", "WNBTA", "INFO: is there a custody arrangement? I think YWNBTA but if it\u2019s during a time that belongs to him then yes. Otherwise, Hell no! \n\nI would be so mad, I\u2019d tell them sorry but you have plans but to please feel free to drop off gifts since you\u2019re only 8 minutes away. \n\nTake her to see a disney movie. Go get mani pedi\u2019s and a fun dinner. With any luck, she may have surprise gifts on her doorstep when she gets home. But I wouldn\u2019t count on it or mention it to her.\n\nEDIT: typo", "Didn't realize you were only 17 so apologies if I came on a bit harsh.  But I'll stand by making the decision as the parent.  The kid wants to go to the party, maybe even more now that shes sad dad didn't call her, but oh, dad wants to throw me a party, will probably seem like a make-up in her mind.  I know cause I've had to watch my daughter get excited and then disappointed by her dad repeatedly. I'm reserving judgement cause I wanted info that OP hasnt responded to yet."]}
