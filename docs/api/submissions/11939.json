Not even a call to congratulate her. Conversely, you could have told him earlier to either be there for his kid or not. Ask your daughter, explain the situation, and let her decide. The problem is if you decide for her she will blame you for potential contact loss with her dad. I saw in a comment that your daughter is only 4 but I think she is capable to decide this.", "NTA but I would consider taking her. I get why you feel the way you do and rightfully so. However this could be fun and memorable for your daughter. I know it\u2019s sucks but I\u2019d say be the bigger person.", "ESH. She\u2019s now at an age she will understand and remember. Yes, what he did sucks. But it\u2019s still nice for your daughter to have this party thrown for her. I understand how you feel but if you don\u2019t take her she\u2019s the person missing out most.", "Unless it's your ex's scheduled time with her custody wise, NTA.  If the ex and the ex family really cared they'd make an effort. Clearly, your daughter is an after thought for them and not a priority.", "NTA. Dad want his daughter to have a birthday party, he can pick her up. \n  You should throw a birthday party for her. Not invite any from the Ex's side.", "I'm going to go with a very sympathetic ESH based on what you've said. \n\nYeah, they didn't need to share the birthday parties between cousins. But for her own dad to not even recognise her birthday? Absolutely bizarre behaviour.\n\nThe only reason I'm including you in the ESH is because even though they're acting like trash, I feel like  your daughter would benefit more from at least having SOME acknowledgement of her birthday having passed by her dad, than none at all.", "NTA\nThese people don't care about her. Surround her with people who love her and don't treat her like she's second class.", "As someone who has been the child in this situation, YWBTA. Or, not an asshole - but making a decision I think your daughter would grow to feel hurt by when she was older. She's young, at four she doesn't understand the concept of proving a point or lateness or setting boundaries - she understands that she has a dad, and a birthday and a party. When she's a bit older you might be able to have a real conversation wit her about the fact she's entitled to respect from him and that she can draw lines when she doesn't feel prioritised etc but at the moment she's at an age where the best you can do is try and make things feel normal for her, and normal is going to your birthday and seeing your dad.", "ESH\n\nYour daughter is 4 ... for 3 years your ex\u2019s family has not acknowledged her birthday in any way? Why?? And why have you continued to allow Dad to get away with this behavior? Every year you have brought cousin a gift & every year their family has done nothing?? Why is this happening?? Why are you worried about cousin\u2019s kid\u2019s birthday on your daughter\u2019s birthday?\n\nThere\u2019s never a good reason to not celebrate a child\u2019s birthday. It\u2019s your daughter. She is the person who is missing out & you are creating a relationship with ex\u2019s family that is not acceptable. Do what\u2019s best for your daughter! Do your job! Advocate for your daughter! Work together with your ex to give your daughter all the love & support she needs... from her entire family.", "NTA\n\nYour ex on the other hand is an enormously huge one. Your ex's family clearly didn't want your daughter to be there, or care about your daughter at all. Taking a kid to a party where she isn't welcommed wouldn't do her any good. You did the right thing.", "NTA I would say.\n\nUsually I would say what your daughter wants is most important and you should never ever weaponize your kid in a divorce or alienate the other parent. But in this case (from what I know) I don't think you're doing either of that. You seem like you want him to be involved and present in her live and be a father.... just yeah, he already fails. And I would actually set your daughters wishes back this time to prove a point. \n\nOf course she will say yes to the party because she is four and doesn't understand whats going on, but I think if you accept her fathers behaviour this time it will never get better and you are going to do your daughter a disservice in the long run.\n\nHe will think what he's doing is fine because he got through with it and never make an effort. He needs to know that his choices and actions have consequences and he learns it better right away then later when your daughter is old enough to understand and be hurt and disappointed.", "It's really hard on both you and your daughter and I don't think you're an AH at all. My daughter is in the same situation - her daughter's dad only wants to know once in a blue moon then makes all sorts of unreasonable demands. So he didn't see her for 18 months, then turned up on Christmas Day at my house, with a totally inappropriate and expensive present, demanding to see his daughter. It's horrible for my granddaughter to be used like this at his own convenience.\n\nHowever, your daughter won't understand the politics behind it, or even the significance of the date. Take her to the party, let her enjoy it without comment.\n\nTrust me, she will understand in time what her father's like, unless he improves. She will only resent you if he has the right to say 'your mother wouldn't let me see you.' Don't give him that ammo.", "Tbh we haven't talked about it too much. She's 4, so of course she wants to go to a party, but she was also upset that she didn't get to see her dad, and that \"cousin got a party and I didn't\". It also didn't help that we only stayed for a few minutes, because we weren't invited, so naturally she was upset. If it were a one time thing I'd be whatever, but this is the 3rd year in a row that I've put up with the blatant favoritism and gave on, though I have spoken with him about it in years past.", "If you're suggesting a 4 year old decide this I really have to think you don't have kids.  The kid will pick the party.\n\nMy daughter at 8 was invited to a party of a kid in her class who constantly makes fun of her.  Guess what?  She wanted to go.  Even when I talked to her and pointed out how the girl made her cry the week before, it didn't matter.  All my daughter cared about was that there was a party and she wanted to go.  Parents need to make this decision, kids are not mature enough to.", "I'll keep that in mind, thanks for reading the long post.", ">She\u2019s now at an age she will understand and remember.\n\nShe won't. Tell me any memory from when you were four.\n\n>But it\u2019s still nice for your daughter to have this party thrown for her.\n\nYou kidding? It wasn't thrown for her. It was, \"Shit, did you forget too that Tony had a kid with that chick Tiffany? I guess we have to throw a separate party for her now.\" They did it as an afterthought, as by OP's description they don't care about her daughter at all.", "They haven't been willing to make an effort in 4 years. Doesn't seem like that's going to change.", "Damn dude, you didn't even read the initial post.", ">Work together with your ex to give your daughter all the love & support she needs... from her entire family.\n\nYou kidding? She clearly explained how the family tries to be as absent of the kid's life as possibly. What should she do? Force the daughter on the grandparents and father who clearly don't want anything to do with her? And you think the kid spending time with people that clearly don't want her is somehow her interest?", "So you're saying I should not take her to the party, correct?", "I posted the same thing. Anyway.", "Sorry, but that's on you. It's the third year it's happened, what were you thinking? Her Dad's a deadbeat which means you have to step up and make all the decisions for her. Seems like you are trying to be the victim here. Your daughter is.\n\nYTA", "I have LOTS of memories from when I was 4. I remember my birthday, first day at school. Lots of school memories. Holidays etc.", "Honestly I was reading up on that literally yesterday the majority of people start rapidly losing memories of their childhood by age of 7, so technically she's going to remember it but like only for a couple more years unless they add so much extra bullshit on top of the singular event so it leaves a traumatic imprint.", "I had my tonsils out and the doctors pretended to put my doll under anesthesia. I had just started school and I remember being away and coming back. Kid's remember things that impact their lives, even 4 year olds.", "I\u2019m saying you should do everything you can to allow your child to see & celebrate with her Dad whenever. Your daughter shouldn\u2019t be punished because the adults are making bad choices. You & your ex need to get on the same page with parenting. It\u2019s not acceptable for your daughter to miss out because the adults don\u2019t want to make an effort. \n\nThere\u2019s no purpose for not allowing her to have a relationship with her Dad. If that means you have to remind Dad every year or invite everyone to your house for birthday, then do it! A child can never have too many people who love them in their life. \n\nHowever, I think it\u2019s incredibly bizarre that cousin never mentioned they were having a birthday party at the park when you called for her address. Why would she tell you to meet them there if they weren\u2019t intending on inviting your daughter? If ex\u2019s family is intentionally trying to hurt your daughter, then it\u2019s your job to protect her.", "So you think I shouldn't take her to the party, is what you're saying.", "I respectfully disagree with your second paragraph. He's an adult, older than me, I don't need to remind him that he has a child he needs to see. He knows. If he does somehow forget, he has a neice that is also a living reminder. Also, why would I urge my daughter to yearn and miss and want a relationship with a person who needs to be reminded that she exists? That would be doing her more harm than good. When she wants to see him she does, she just never asks for him because she never sees them.", "It's not bizarre. They don't view them as family. I do agree the Ex's family turns the screws on the situation.", "Um, yes.", "You\u2019re both adults so it\u2019s each of your responsibility to figure out what is best for your daughter. If you think Dad shouldn\u2019t be in your daughter\u2019s life, then don\u2019t do anything. She will eventually understand that both parents have the power to make decisions. Hopefully, she will feel that everyone tried their best for her well-being. \n\nI think you\u2019re setting a very bad precedent that will negatively affect your daughter\u2019s life. Her Dad missing her birthday every year will do nothing but hurt your daughter. That should be the last thing you ever want for her.", "Oh, so you're a right fighter. At the expense of your own child. Nice. not.", "Then your rating is wrong. It's WIBTA if I didn't take her. If you think I shouldn't take her, it's NTA. I agree with everything you said though, I need to grow a backbone to them for my daughter."]}
