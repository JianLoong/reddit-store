{"id": 27863, "submission_id": "16v8tkx", "title": "WIBTA for refusing to get married in a Catholic Church?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 (27M) and I (27F) have a happy, respectful 3-year relationship and have cohabited harmoniously for 2 years. My fianc\u00e9 was raised as a Catholic and was an active member of the Church until he went to university. I was baptised a Christian and attended Church of England schools; however, as an adult, I have been atheist. When we met, we joked about how we were both raised religious but no longer believed in God.\n\nI've always said I didn't want a big wedding; I just want a relaxed, intimate day and for us to throw a party once we are married. To this, he would say \"yeah, we don't need a big day\" or \"whatever makes you happy\" and we would lightheartedly discuss eloping. My mum supports these wishes but my fianc\u00e9's mother has suggested a reception venue and discussed coaches for guests to get from the ceremony to the reception (e.g. has planned the whole day out already).\n\nSince we last visited his family, my fianc\u00e9 now says he's always wanted to get married in the church where his parents and grandparents got married. He says this is the only thing he's ever asked of me and has made some (uncharacteristically) sarcastic remarks about getting married elsewhere: \"yeah, let's get married in an office that has no sentimental value to either of us\".\n\nFrom my understanding, I'd have to attend a course, we'd have to attend that church (it's in Wales and we live in London), and we'd have to vow to raise our children in the Church. I have my own feelings about the Catholic Church as I don't agree with their views on abortion, I'm not homophobic, I don't believe cohabitation is a sin, and I find them outdated (e.g. no women in the clergy).\n\nI raised these feelings with my fianc\u00e9 privately and expressed that it didn't feel right to me to be dishonest on our wedding day, vowing to raise my children in the Church, and our service being all about God. He fed my concerns back to his mother who apparently said \"it doesn't need to be a lie, I'll take the children to Church every Sunday!\" ...\n\nI feel I'm sacrificing a lot as it would inevitably become the white wedding I never wanted. I would feel awkward/embarrassed all day and would have to stand in front of friends, family, and my fianc\u00e9, (and God, apparently) and lie on a day that is meant to be special.\n\nI'd silently resigned myself to going through with it, because I understand the pressure my fianc\u00e9 feels to please his family, and became upset one night. My fianc\u00e9 came to comfort me and I told him I'd decided we could get married in his church. We fell asleep and when I tried to raise the conversation with him again he said \"I don't want to talk about our wedding, it makes me feel sad\".\n\nIn my heart, I'm against the idea of getting married there and it feels like a wedding for his family rather than for us. WIBTA for refusing to get married there, or should I suck it up and focus on the marriage part, which is much more important?", "created_utc": 1695986221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16v8tkx/wibta_for_refusing_to_get_married_in_a_catholic/", "score": 133, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nevermind the fact that the wedding day is about BOTH of your love, not what outside influences want, especially family. Do you really want to spend your special day together feeling like you've given up a large chunk of your morals and opinions?\n\nHis sarcastic and demeaning remarks to bully you into this also rings alarm bells for me, is this a regular occurrence, or is this out of character for him to behave during a disagreement?\n\nEither way I'd say put off plans to get wed until you come to some form of compromise, or worst case scenario accept the lack of compatibility and go your separate ways. \n\n(I was raised RC and am an aethiest)", "OP, you\u2019re trying to separate the *wedding* from the *marriage*.

It\u2019s gross and unethical for your fianc\u00e9 to insist upon and not the foundation any marriage should start on. \n\nHe should feel sad, yes, but more embarrassed about what he\u2019s doing here.", "Huge red flag. You need to say no and mean it.\n\nNTA", ">should I suck it up and focus on the marriage part, which is much more important?\n\nYou should definitely focus on the marriage part. What's your marriage going to be like? This guy is willing to walk all over you to have the wedding of his mother's dreams. He's eager to please his family even in ways that directly affect you and make you profoundly uncomfortable. And his mom wants to take your future children to Mass every week.\n\nFocus on the marriage part. Think long and hard about that.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. He might not be active in the church but it sounds like the church is active in him.  Yes, the wedding is just a day but it\u2019s a day where you make promises - do you want to be crossing your fingers for some and not others?  A non-religious venue might not have sentimental value now, but after you\u2019ve been married there it will - you\u2019ll be able to tell your kids that where you got married.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re planning on having kids being on the same page about religion is a pretty fundamental issue.  If you don\u2019t want your kids to have a faith-based upbringing marrying into a family where this is obviously going to be a point of contention means it\u2019s going to be an argument at some point, and you need to be clear which side your husband will be on.  First it\u2019s his church because tradition, then it\u2019s first communion because his mum wants it, then it\u2019s schools\u2026 And his mum will push; her son marrying outside the church is a loss of face for her (Catholic Parenting 101 is ensuring you\u2019ve secured the next generation). She likely wants a big do with the bells and whistles partly because it reflects well on her", "100% NTA. Stay strong.", "NTA. You agreed on how you would get married and then he switched it up to appease his parents. No way going from eloping to taking a class. You are going to look back with resentment. I\u2019d put your foot down and say no. You already sound miserable and he misled you.", "NTA. You would be TA to yourself (and your future kids) if you did agree.\n\nAs for your future MIL saying \" I'll take the children to Church every Sunday!\" ...\" you need to put your foot down now. If you cave on this you are telling your fianc\u00e9 and his family that they are the ones who get to decide how your kids are raised and that your wishes are irrelevant.\n\nFirst it's the church wedding, then its getting the kids baptised, then taking them to church & Sunday school and all the other crap which you hated. Is this the life you want for your future kids? You need to put a stop to it now before you even consider having children. And you your fianc\u00e9 needs to stand up for you against his mother, if he won't do this then he is telling you that you will always come second place to his mother.", "No. Firm No. It is your wedding, he said he would want to get married there, fine, but you will have to tell him about not: learning X weeks, no vow to raise children with the church, no baptised etc! You 2 agreed on the LOCATION, not the CONTENT of the wedding", "I think it's good that this has come up NOW, before you get married. He wants what will make his mother happy, and that's not good for you at all. \n\nI think you should do some non religious pre marital counselling and put a pause on the wedding. Is he going to run to mummy on every disagreement? Is he going to want to name any kids the names his mother wants?\n\nHas he changed his stance on religion? Some people do.\n\nYou need to put a big pause on this and really work out if he is going to be a husband and a partner or if you are going to be a third wheel between him and his mother.", "If you do this, you will resent your husband and MIL until your last breath.   And, do you really want her being in control of your child\u2019s religious experience?   Especially when you are not particularly interested in going to church?  A civil ceremony and large reception, if your in-laws want to pay for it is okay.  Your fianc\u00e9 saying that he wants \u201cjust one thing\u201d is rather deceptive and manipulative.   You wanted just one thing, to have a small, intimate wedding.   You need some pre-marital counseling.  Just the two of you, because you need to decide how much you are going to allow your MIL to have a say in your marriage and family life.  Counseling will help you learn to talk to each other without finger pointing, and name calling.\n\nThink hard about how you want to proceed.", "NTA. Honestly, you might need to have another conversation about getting married since it seems like he\u2019s more serious about being Catholic than he previously stated. Can you hold off in you\u2019re both honest with each other? The comment about not wanting to get married in an impersonal office rather than a place that means something to you guys (**his church**) is sending up some yellow/orange flags. Him saying talking about the wedding is making him sad without discussing is manipulative. His mom saying she\u2019ll take the kids to church every Sunday and the fact he didn\u2019t shut that down concerns me. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem like he ever said he was agnostic or atheist outright, just that he wasn\u2019t religious. This will be a thing you\u2019re not going to be able to ignore. People joke about being a recovering Catholic, but that guilt and dogma will never not be there. I was raised Catholic (am agnostic/atheist since middle school), my grandparents were devout and pressured my parents into us doing the CCD classes growing up and threatened to disown our family when we started going to a different church when I was in 8th grade. I hated church and one time during a CCD class hid in the church kitchen to avoid doing to a Christmas service that was just for the CCD kids. We lived a 9 hour drive from one grandparents and two from the other. If you\u2019re in the same area as his parents it\u2019s going to be very difficult to keep religion out. It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re on the same page at the moment on what you want. Please have a honest conversation about this, don\u2019t get married yet since it seems like you\u2019re both having issues at the moment.", "NTA\n\nI am sorry, but I think your fianc\u00e9 is lying to you. He can't, at the same time, declare that he shares the same values as you AND wants to be married in a church (with all the bells and religious whistles). Or, he is trying to make his mommy happy, which makes it worse because he will never have youe back when it comes to the (inevitable) issues that she will cause in your life.", "I'm a practicing Catholic and I completely think you WNBTA. \n\nThis is 100% pressure from his parents and does not come from what HE wants. You should *never* be forced to make a *vow* regardless of religion, beliefs, or whatever. The Catholic Church does not ask people to enter the Church unwillingly. You have to be open, and truly desire to be Catholic. (All are welcome, but no one should be forced). \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 need to sit down face to face and really hash this out. No mom, no church members, no outside inputs. What do YOU TWO want your marriage to look like? Build that image together and build paths to reach that goal. Your marriage will not survive if either of you live your lives to please others. Do what you believe is right and stand by what you believe.", "OP please read what you wrote over and over again until you leave this relationship.  Tell your fianc\u00e9 to marry his mommy and just run the fuck away from both of them.", "First off he should be concerned about what is desired by the two of you together.  The other issue is Catholic Church is a ridiculously evil organization. Of the \"Holy wars\" the Catholic church is almost completely responsible for them all. To this day the saga of abuse and cover up continues. I just don't understand how he can't listen and consider your desires though.", "Catholic (not homophobic, and pro abortion in case of rape) here.\n\nFirst of all, Christians are even worse than catholics when it comes to LGBTQ+ issues, abortion, etc. \n\nWith that said, NTA.

Re-evaluate your relationship OP, because it's obvious You both don't want the same.", "NTA.\n\nIf you do decide to go ahead with the wedding in this form, look into the thing called a one-sided ceremony, where a Catholic marries a non-Catholic. You will still have to jump through hoops and swear that you won't stand in the way of upbringing the children Catholic, but it will take the burden off you personally lying that you believe in any of this. Worth looking into.", "NTA - DON'T DO IT.  You have laid out some major problems with the Catholic Church - anti women, anti gay, anti sex, anti reproductive health care.  Yet, he ignores this and says he'll bring the kids to Church so they too can be indoctrinated in a misogynistic fashion.  Yet, discussing this makes him feel sad?  Apparently his family is more important for your wedding then you are.  If he can't discuss this with you, how do you think the marriage will function?  Let me give you a hint, a problem arises in your marriage, he doesn't talk to you, he goes to his family, the family tells him what to do and when you want to discuss it, it makes him feel sad so he shuts you down.  Is this what you want?????", "Nta. You should be his number 1 priority, not his mum. Think long and hard. It'll never change", "NTA\n\nthe fact that he\u2019s willing to tell his mother the details of a private conversation is a major red flag. and his mother is really overstepping by saying she\u2019ll take your kids to church. \n\ntake a step back and think about the future- giving in to this Very important thing (Catholic weddings and traditions aren\u2019t a joke) will lay the groundwork for the future. If you give in to this, your future husband and in laws will expect to get their way every time. \n\nif he wanted to get married in the church he should have dated and proposed to a woman who believes in it.", "NTA\nThis is what I call a deal breaker! This will never end. Upon conception of your first child (and now you're obligated to have them if you didn't want them before) they will be part of the catholic church.

Specifically troubling is MIL\u2019s comment that she would take the children to church for you as she\u2019s not only disregarding your wishes for your own wedding, she\u2019s making assumptions/decisions on how your future children will be raised. It seems as though your fianc\u00e9 has been influenced by his parents wants when what he needs to do is stick up for you. These issues never go away but can get worse if not addressed. I would sit down with your fianc\u00e9 to discuss not just the wedding but how you want to raise your kids etc. Be clear and calm - write down a few talking points ahead of time as you\u2019re bound to go off track. \n\nI was raised catholic, as were most of my friends I grew up with and most who had a church wedding only did so for the pictures as the local church is very old so it looks great as a photo backdrop.

I wish I could turn back time and NOT let my MIL take my kids to church. One is a believer, and the other is not. I'm not.

This is way more insidious than you realize.", "I could be down voted for this, but whatever. \n\nYou don't have to marry him. \n\nYes, you've had a \"respectable relationship\" for 3 years, but now there's cracks in the foundation because his mom has her fingers in his brain and he's letting it happen. \n\nIf it was just getting married where his family had, that's one thing - but from my experience it's never that easy with the Catholic church. You even tell us the checklist you HAVE to do before they'll let you marry in their church. A checklist neither of you agree with, from what it sounds like. At least, that's what your partner *says*.\n\nSo I ask, what's the REAL underlying problem that your partner is having? Has he anyways wanted to marry in that church and he's been giving you lip service each time you've spoken about marriage? Has he been playing the long game to return to the church with a wife and kids? \n\nIt's really odd that he'd switch gears so suddenly without any signs that his mom had this much control over him over the last 3 years. You might want to look into non-church counselors/therapists to talk this out before walking down any aisle. \n\nPersonally, NTA. I would stick to my guns.

My fianc\u00e9 was raised as a Catholic and was an active member of the Church until he went to university. I was baptised a Christian and attended Church of England school; however, as an adult, I have been atheist. When we met, we joked about how we were both raised religious but no longer believed in God.\n\nI've always said I didn't want a big wedding; I just want a relaxed, intimate day and for us to throw a party once we are married. To this, he would say \"yeah, we don't need a big day\" or \"whatever makes you happy\" and we would lightheartedly discuss eloping. My mum supports these wishes but my fianc\u00e9's mother has suggested a reception venue and discussed coaches for guests to get from the ceremony to the reception (e.g. has planned the whole day out already).\n\nSince we last visited his family, my fianc\u00e9 now says he's always wanted to get married in the church where his parents and grandparents got married. He says this is the only thing he's ever asked of me and has made some (uncharacteristically) sarcastic remarks about getting married elsewhere: \"yeah, let's get married in an office that has no sentimental value to either of us\".\n\nFrom my understanding, I'd have to attend a course for x weeks, we'd have to attend that church (it's in Wales and we live in London), and I'd have to vow to raise our children in the Church. I have my own feelings about the Catholic Church as I don't agree with their views on abortion, I'm not homophobic, I don't believe cohabitation is a sin, and I find them outdated (e.g. no women in the clergy).\n\nI raised these feelings with my fianc\u00e9 privately and expressed that it didn't feel right to me to be dishonest on our wedding day, vowing to raise my children in the Church, and our service being all about God. He fed my concerns back to his mother who apparently said \"it doesn't need to be a lie, I'll take the children to Church every Sunday!\" ...\n\nI feel I'm sacrificing a lot as it would inevitably become the white wedding I never wanted. I would feel awkward/embarrassed all day and would have to stand in front of friends, family, and my fianc\u00e9, (and God, apparently) and lie on a day that is meant to be special.\n\nI'd silently resigned myself to going through with it, because I understand the pressure my fianc\u00e9 feels to please his family, and became upset one night. My fianc\u00e9 came to comfort me and I told him I'd decided we could get married in his church. We fell asleep and when I tried to raise the conversation with him again he said \"I don't want to talk about our wedding, it makes me feel sad\".\n\nIn my heart, I'm against the idea of getting married there and it feels like a wedding for his family rather than for us. WIBTA for refusing to get married there, or should I suck it up and focus on the marriage part, which is much more important?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was made clear there that I, not my husband, was to raise the children Catholic. That basically means just baptising them. If Grandma wants to take them to mass, good for her. I used to bribe my kids with fish and chips for dinner after mass for reward for going lol.  There are about 5 different types of Catholic wedding.

Let's discuss this in the future after we have had time to cool off.\n\nYou'll still be engaged and still have the same relationship.

Having been through it, the conversations that I saw around the room that had not been had were eye opening.

We went to the meetings with the priest but discussed between ourselves that nothing would change that neither I nor any future children would be raised Catholic this was just a gesture for our wedding to make family happy. At no time was I pressured into this, this was raised as an option and properly discussed beforehand. \n\nYou on the other hand have been railroaded into this at his families demands and it seems like he doesn\u2019t want to upset his family.

The ceremony was like an hour long, with only maybe 5 mins focused on the couple and the rest being scripture focused with weird portions where the priest would kind of sing bits of it. There were also many lines in the stuff they were reading that were frankly creepy, saying stuff like \u201cas you prepare to receive the seed\u201d and implying that the woman\u2019s only value in the relationship is to produce kids to join their cult.

This is him trying to avoid talking about it, but blaming you for his inability, or desire not,  to communicate.\n\nRight now he is prioritizing his family's wants over your wants. Also not good. I really found it distasteful where he commented that his mother would take the children to church. That really shows who is driving his need for a church wedding.\n\nHonestly it sounds like a load of hassle for you, but not a hassle for him.

The church low-key induces the need for a big guest list; they frame it as this group of people supporting and celebrating and witnessing the marriage. \n\nMy DH is an atheist and I'm not active in the RC church anymore. I still wanted to get married in the church for personal reasons. My SO felt neutral about it, so he agreed. I think that's the crux of it - if one SO feels neutral about church wedding and the other person wants to do it, then you might as well get married in the church for the sake of the one person who wants to do it. Since you dislike the idea, you shouldn't be forced into it. \n\nAlso, you may want to have hard conversations with your SO now about these observations you're having. These are topics (family influences, MIL relationship) you want to be on the same page about before you marry the guy.", "NTA. I did get married in a Catholic church (my husband and I are the flipped version of you and your fiance), and while it was right for us at the time, we discussed at length our reasoning and things have changed for us a lot since then. If we were to get married now, we probably would do it differently, and we're having earnest discussions about whether we want to get our kids baptised. \n\nIf it helps at all:\n\n\\- Only one of you regularly has to go to mass. I went to the lunchtime service near my office once a week, this meant that I ticked the Catholic box of 'regular attendance' and it was only a 30 minute service, win/win.\n\n\\- You don't have to attend the parish your husband wants to get married at as long as it is the regular place of worship for ONE of you, and the priest is happy to write a letter stating that. So while I regularly attended the one near my office, because my husband never went anywhere else more regularly, and he only attended the church we got married in on alternate holidays with my family, as far as the Registry office were concerned, that counted as HIS regular place of worship. So you don't need to be schlepping to Wales every Sunday.\n\n\\- I think we were very fortunate in the priests we encountered, who were extremely aware of how modern life was not reflected in the reality of the Church teachings, so our 'course' was a series of nice chats with a lovely old man about walks in the Lake District, and one 8-hour day (in the church near where we lived, not the one where we got married) entirely of mixed-religion couples led by two very devout Catholics who the parish priest kept heckling because everyone else in the room had been together longer than them - some of them even had kids! So their Deep Relationship Wisdom was rather redundant. Mostly it seemed to be a case of because Catholics are against divorce, they wanted to make sure that we weren't getting married for shits and giggles and had talked about key issues in our relationship. BUT not all priests are like that, and if you don't know the one at your MIL's church, that's not necessarily a box you will be comfortable opening.\n\nIn the end, however, by refusing to have a Catholic wedding when you don't believe in the church's teachings and won't be able to commit to the promises they want you to make, you're actually being MORE respectful to your MIL. The Catholics see the wedding service as one of the seven sacraments, really key events in a person's life that have a lot of religious significance.The counter-argument could be that actually (regardless of the political elements of the church which I 100% agree with you there), it would be really disrespectful of you to go in there and treat those vows like something meaningless.\n\nOne of our motivations for having a Catholic wedding was because until that point all the civil ceremonies we'd been to had felt very rushed, soulless and generic. Most of them lasted ten minutes, and it didn't feel like the occasion was really given any time to be savoured - I wonder if that might be some of your fiance's worries, with him talking about sentimental value? However, I went to a beautiful civil wedding a couple of years ago that really changed my mind. The added bonus of having everything in one place as well means you have so much more time in your day to spend with the people you love instead of chivvying everyone around. Especially if you'll have to put on coaches!! I bet you could find a gorgeous venue that has a lot of meaning for you both and put together a wonderful ceremony that really reflects the two of you perfectly.\n\nSorry this was an essay, I just remember what a PAIN it was to wrestle registry office vs church (and weirdly the church was the easier of the two, you'd expect if anyone was going to be unreasonable it would be the Catholics - I think they were just happy we were getting married!)", "A lot of lapse Catholics still want to get married in a church.

Are you okay with that? Figure it out now, make sure you're both on the same page, otherwise this can be an even bigger argument in the future.", "I'm an atheist who married a Catholic in a Catholic Church.  I refused any courses, refused to go to church, and we cut bits off the ceremony where I had to agree to raise children in the faith. My husband had to get special permission from the Bishop of the diocese, and I was told it would have been easier for him to may a Muslim, cos at least they'd have faith in God (the priest seemed quite forward, saying that there is only one God and people worship him in different ways). One of my kids is a pure scientist and the other believes in God and goes to a CofE school, but I've still got time to work on it! \n\nAt the end of the day, it was important to the man I love and I didn't care where we did it.

Not only did we have to attend marriage classes, but we also had to lie and misrepresent ourselves. I won\u2019t even go into the guest list. If I had to do it all over again, I would have a completely different wedding, as would my husband. I never ever ever look at any of the photos from the day.
