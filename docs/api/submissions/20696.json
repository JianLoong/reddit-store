My dad passed unexpectedly, we broke up, & 4 yrs later we decided to try again. My husband proposed on 2 year anniversary. My family was super involved in wedding planning & at first so was MIL. My husbands little sis/bro were going to be FG/RB. MIL and I came up with cute ideas for them. The day before my dress appts I fractured my ankle. The new date was Easter weekend/weekend before FGs bday. I now know MIL didn't come dress shopping because she didn't want me to out shine FGs bday.\n\nMy MIL got distant after starting new relationship. We met up w/ MIL & got on topic of guest list. It came out her ex-husband was invited to wedding bc my husband felt like he was a father figure in his life. MIL wasn't happy. MIL told her dad & next wk he called my husband to meet for coffee. He came home from coffee w/ grandpa & was basically a meet to convince us to not invite ex. MIL was supposed to be paying for rehearsal dinner & nobody else on his side was contributing at all where my side was giving us money to help pay for wedding/very active in planning. If MIL/grandpa was paying for catering/venue & wanted a say in who was invited is one thing but they weren't.\n\n3 wks before wedding MIL says she will only be at ceremony. We didn't want any drama on wedding day. We say ok & tell her to be there 30 mins before ceremony. She asked if we even wanted her to come since she is only there for 1.5 hrs? We said of course we want her to come but she wanted to be there for ceremony & 30 mins before gives her time to do her hair/makeup on her own/would have less chance running into ex.\n\nIts wedding wk. I call vendors for rehearsal dinner/wedding. I call restaurant for rehearsal. They show reservation canceled & was never paid. We were livid. We discussed the issues we had & we decided to uninvite her. We messaged MIL saying since issues with ex being there & rehearsal dinner being canceled w/o us knowing we feel its best she didn't come to wedding. She said it was a surprise. We asked why change location she had us pick out. MIL said we didn't include her in planning & my husband said she distanced herself/became all about her new family/forgot him. MIL denied & said my husband was ungrateful, took screenshots, & removed herself from chat.\n\n1 wk after wedding, we find out MIL went on cruise w/ bf/kids leaving weekend of wedding. We don't know for sure how long she planned this but I work at same place as MIL & u can't request a wk off 2 weeks prior. She bragged to friends she had a trip when wedding was, mos before. We think she planned cruise w/ new family/not being at wedding mos prior. We don't think we are wrong.

Presumably, since she is a flower girl, not a bridesmaid, your husband's younger sister is quite a young child.  It is rather AH to expect a mother to put her young daughter's birthday in second place to clothes shopping with you.  This isn't about you \"outshining\" the sister's birthday, it is a mother prioritizing the birthday of her young child.  That part earns you an unambiguous AH.\n\nAs for the rest of it, you don't give enough details for a clear judgement.  A lot depends on the circumstances of the breakup of MIL and her ex.  If, for example, the ex was abusive towards your MIL or any of her children, it would be absolutely AH to invite him at all, especially because they'd have to interact as more than just guests at the wedding, but in the roles of parents of the groom, and to expect an abuse victim to go through that with their abuser is AH.  If the breakup is recent,  there may be emotional landmines left that your MIL doesn't want triggered.  If the breakup was reasonably amicable, and in the more distant past, they can be civil for half a day for the wedding, although it is reasonable for her to ask that he not be at the rehearsal dinner, if she's paying.\n\nAs for the cruise, you only have a second-hand report that she was planning it for the time of the wedding months in advance.  Be cautious about putting too much weight on gossip as evidence.  If she was planning it that far in advance, and not discussing it with her own son, then there are issues between them that he hasn't shared with you, and you should probably try to get to the bottom of what is going on between them, so you don't keep getting taken by surprise when things flare up.\n\nETA: If she said, \"If you invite my ex, I am not attending, and am not going to pay for the rehearsal dinner\" and you went ahead and invited him, then it is reasonable for her not to pay after she gave you specific warning.  It was foolish just to expect that the rehearsal dinner would continued without you making alternate plans.  She'd *have to* cancel the reservation to get her name off of it and not be liable for the cost.  When she said she wasn't paying, it was your responsibility to follow through with alternate plans, not assume that plans made with her name and credit card number would still be happening.", "NTA.  My step daughter has this same issue with her dad. She is not biologically mine. But me and her mom get along great.  Me and my ex divorced 4 years ago.   He has issues with me being present and she stands her ground which I am proud of.  You divorce people not kids.   I hope the issue with your MIL gets resolved for the better. I would advise no contact. It takes a lot to plan a last min family cruise, there is no way with your rule at work for vacation she didn\u2019t know about it before hand Jensen why she asked if you even water her there. She was hoping for a no to have that pity party.", "Oh the toxicity.\n\nNTA \n\nInfo: Just curious, are the young ones her bio kids? If so how old are they?", "We are now basically no contact. We don't talk to her unless we are seeing the kids, which has only happened twice since the wedding 9 months ago", "Dress shopping didn't interfere with the sister's bday bc it was a Saturday and the sister's bday wasn't until that Monday and wasn't even going to be celebrated until the next weekend. Divorce was messy and was about 2 yrs ago and wasn't due to any serious thing like abuse, it was due to them arguing/didn't get along anymore. The ex was invited to the wedding as a guest, not a member of the wedding party and were to be sat at different tables at the wedding. He wasn't invited to the rehearsal dinner at all because he wasn't in the wedding party. She also never said specifically that if we invited him to the wedding she wouldn't pay for the rehearsal dinner. We just so happened to find out because I called the restaurant the week before the wedding and they told me it was canceled.", "MIL wants to be the victim by getting uninvited while also the victor who went on a cruise. Honestly, she sounds like a low-contact drama that you want to keep at arm's length. You did nothing wrong. NTA", "NTA. Your husband needs to completely sever all ties with her. She is an awful person and your life would be better without her in it.", "How dare you!  My female dog may be awful but she's not like that!  (Jk, obvi)\n\nSeriously OP, she sounds like a drama llama.  Don't feed her, she spits.", "I can't imagine why her ex-husband and her aren't together anymore.  Wow.  NTA.", "Nope, NTA. She is out to make trouble, limit her ability to do so.", "Cancelling the rehearsal dinner and her not having to pay for that paid for her cruise with her new family, I'd bet!"]}
