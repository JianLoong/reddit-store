You should have stayed in the shower, probably covering up with a towel. But don't be ashamed of having people choose to burst in on you naked, that isn't your fault. It sounds like it would be polite to talk to her mother and ask if you offended her by helping, and apologize for any discomfort.

Obviously you were in the shower when your gf's mother burst in and became violently ill.  You didn't have time to grab a robe or a towel before rushing to her assistance.  I'm sure the situation was just as painfully awkward for both you and your gf's mother too.  Hopefully your girlfriend will come to understand that too.  In the future I'm sure you'll remember this incident and all have a good laugh about it.", "I call BS", "NTA. I do wish our society would get over his fear of the human body.

Fuck were you suppose to do?  Start conditioning or clean your ass????", "NTA. It's panic times three. 18yo man in the shower hears someone burst in the bathroom in obvious distress. Panic, to panic and medical concern. He's 18, how can he be expected to know how to handle a vomiting woman? Holding a girl's hair back is a common trope. Mom is suddenly sick and panicked, maybe didn't even KNOW that it was the boyfriend in the shower, easily could have been the daughter. Daughter is also 18 and doesn't have enough life experience to know that most uncomfortable situations need to be laughed off. Super awkward but nobody had bad intentions here.", "NTA.

GF has no reason to be that upset over it tbh.", "NTA\n\nyou werent thinking of that in  a sexy way at all! you were being a caring human and just did what came natural in that situation. hell, you probably forgot you were naked in that moment. you didnt shove your private part in her face. you held her hair while she was getting sick. that is in no way a sexy moment and your gf was right in a split second to be weirded out but once the reality of what happened set in, she should know that you werent making a move on someone that was throwing up. if she keeps being mad over that then you have a few problems with her. is she jealous of her mom ? does she worry that you want to get with her mom? is she just a jealous person of any female?\n\nwhat does her mom say about the situation? is she bothered by it?", "Absolutely NTA. You acted with the best and kindest intentions and it's not your problem if other people see it differently. \nNo-one is an AH here.

It\u2019s not like he fucked her mom.", "The really relevant person to ask is rhe Mom. Was she grateful? Embarrassed? Both?\n\n FWIW, this sounds to me like you were genuinely looking to help out as quickly as possible. So you were naked: big deal. It's just a body, everyone has one, and nudity is not inherently sexual. \n\nI can understand your gf being shocked in the moment, but once the dust settles this should be fine. In my opinion nobody did anything wrong here, with the possible exception of the adult who overindulged.\n\nNAH", "All I can say: I really really hate the way Americans dramatize nakedness\u2026 \n\nAlso NTA", "This comment section is fucking hilarious. I think a lot of people are missing out on the very important context that he is 18. He\u2019s still a kid making stupid immature decisions.

The only way this kid is the asshole is if he purposely did it so he could show some dick to the mom. Other than that, I\u2019m chalking this up to being young and dumb. \n\nAlso man I just gotta fucking say it, not everyone locks the bathroom door. They really fucking don\u2019t.

It\u2019s just such a stupid thing to shit on this kid for.", "You tried to do a kind thing and although your gf's feeling about nudity/body modesty are not uncommon, they are also not universal; many cultures are more comfortable with nudity, so I'm going with NTA.", "When somebody sick like that you don't think of covering up you're trying to help a sick person. It's kind of juvenile to be worried about something like that at a time when somebody needs you especially when you got Hair and you could get it all over the place", "We weren\u2019t there but it obviously triggered OP, he jumped into action to help his ladies family member. His girlfriend is immature, she should have handed him a towel and ushered him away, end of story.", "NAH. He was just doing what he thought was most helpful, no one had any bad intentions. Me personally I HATE throwing up, and would be grateful for whoever held my hair back, and from OP\u2019s post it doesn\u2019t sound like the bf or the mom took it in any way other than helpful, just unfortunate that he happened to be in the shower. I get why the GF is a little upset, but come on, clearly he just wanted to help and neither of them were weird about it. Some people would have rather been left alone while throwing up, but many like comfort as well and thats probably how the BF has been raised. It\u2019s really not that big of a deal as the GF is making it out to be. No one made any advances, they were just trying to be helpful in a gross situation. Overall just an unfortunate gross situation, no one was an AH except I feel the GF is way overreacting. Like I would be very glad that my BF is willing to jump out of the shower to help my mom, if that\u2019s how he treats everyone, that immediate selflessness, concern for my mother, and lack of care for his own dignity would honestly make me like him more.", "NTA, you had an instant reaction that comes from a place of compassion. There is nothing sexual or weird about that. Mama should learn to hold her liquor though at this point lmao", "Nta. You panicked and wasn't really thinking but besides that you were only trying to help her sick mother. If I was her, I would have gone in to do it myself and tell you to cover up.

Down vote me if you want but as a non American. No one is the asshole but everyone's reactions to this situation are a little based in their own sense of \"right/wrong\". \n\n* You did a nice thing and meant well and had good intent; but it wasn't emergent you could have put a towel on that was your oops.\n* Your GF's reaction is fair she might be embarrassed that her mom saw your penis; but are y'all really saying a grown ass mom with an 18 year old has never seen a penis before? It's a penis and all she did was see it; it's not that serious.\n* The mom's reaction is concerning like why is she crying about this? If I was you I would probably talk to her and check in with her and apologize.\n\nComing from a way less anti-nude culture I've seen most of my close family nude to some extent. My mom often walks around in just underpants in the house so once my mom has accidentally walked by my boyfriend in the kitchen entirely nude since she forgot her towel or something, no one was angry or cried about. If anything my boyfriend was the more embarrassed party, I was laughing about it bust chastised her (jokingly and gently) since she knew he was over, and she being a chill person said \"well it happens eventually\".\n\nGet over yourselves a body is just a body, it's not inherently sexual to see someone nude, and yeah @ OP it was dumb man but it's also not that serious.", "NTA op\n\nReally you had only 2 choices, help Mom or stay in the shower.

When I was pregnant with my first I didn't really get sick much, but I went through a stage where I would eat one bite too many of dinner and end up puking. One time my husband stood in the bathroom doorway still eating his bowl of Kraft dinner while watching me puke mine all up (I guess to make sure I didn't need help?). It's been 3.5 years and I still make fun of him for it.", "Yes. If she\u2019s already getting puke on her hair then she\u2019s going to need the shower, so a quick towel-covered exit by OP would have helped her the most. Now she\u2019s a lot more embarrassed (and probably still needed the shower).", "The hair on fair analogy slayed me as well as naked heroics.  Because it gave me the visual of Mom hunched over the toilet, naked hero standing behind her, maybe bent over a little to grab her hair and the GF walks in.  That snap shot will be frozen in her brain for eternity. \n\nThe fact that she\u2019s giving him the silent treatment is ridiculous though. Does she feel it was some sexual moment? The naked hair holding while puking just foreplay?", "Seriously I went on vacation this past august and ate something bad. I was violently ill, my bf comes in to make sure I\u2019m not dying and I was like go away leave me alone through the heaving. If someone who wasn\u2019t him had their dick in my face while I was puking, I\u2019d be pretty mad. Puking is embarrassing and disgusting. A lot of us prefer to do it in private since we know that\u2019s exactly what it is.", "I also have very severe emetophobia and if my partner saw or touched me while I was being sick it would make it a million times worse and I\u2019d have a very hard time getting over it.", "As someone who throws up fairly often, I much prefer to be left alone so I was very happy you shared your perspective. \n\nFor me it's NAH because I do think he was doing what he thought was the kindest thing, while I also understand were everyone is coming from in regards to whether vomiting actually calls for help from her daughter's naked boyfriend.", "That's understandable if you have a phobia, but I'm thinking it's still probably the minority of people who would be comforted by a wet naked teenager touching them when they're hunched over a toilet with their head at dick level.", "I have emetophobia and id be HORRIFIED to have to do that in front of anyone, even worse if they try to help me. And I\u2019d absolutely fucking not get out of the shower if it were someone else. Actually I\u2019d ditch my shower and gtfo of there", "I sometimes have things coming from the other end while vomiting. The last thing I would ever want is someone there to hold me while I am losing control of my body and fluids are coming from every orifice.", "You would be ok with your daughters boyfriends dick dangling by your head/face while holding your hair???? \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah, I agree with this. As a fellow emetophobia sufferer, I\u2019d be super grateful too. Mostly because I\u2019d be in a genuine blind panic", "Time for you to buy hair clips and elastics and always keep them on hold. Frankly, ive never had an issue throwing up my hair up before i puke. Its not like you dont know its coming. And btw, i have a medical issue they cant figure out where i puke daily.", "The only person I don't want around me when I'm puking is my husband. I really don't want to clean up after him too. Thankfully I'm not puking as often as I was on chemo, but it still happens occasionally. Often enough that I keep barf bags within easy reach.", "You\u2019re literally one person out of 8 billion people. Most people, would find this weird. If someone has irritable bowl syndrome and your bf came out the shower naked to hand them toilet paper while they had diarrhea, would that be ok? Holding someone\u2019s hair doesn\u2019t really do much other than provide a bit of comfort and maybe prevent vomit from getting in their hair but she doesn\u2019t need him for that.", "Her *wet and naked* bf though? With his dick at eye level? And as you said, you have a phobia which is not the average experience. I think this guy probably thought he was doing a nice thing, but he def needs to learn from this. What he did was a creep thing to do imo. He could have grabbed his towel and offered to bring her some water and something for her stomach or better yet get her daughter. If she had been on fire, yeah absolutely jump out but she was puking. For most people that wouldn't elicte a visceral reaction and he said in the post she was puking everywhere so he 100% had time to process and decide to do this as opposed to it being a knee-jerk reaction. That makes it especially weird. In that time he didn't think to grab a towel?", "I also have emetophobia so I\u2019m impressed by OP helping. I\u2019d have had a legit panic attack and probably not been able to go in that bathroom or be near that mom for weeks.", "So...you're judging him based on your personal experience? How's that fair....", "You\u2019re okay on your knees in front of a toilet with your daughter\u2019s boyfriend behind you naked pulling your hair?", "That\u2019s a good point! I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have gone in either!", "Thank you kindly.", "He was straddling her back with the tip grazing it and every time she moved she got a back rub.", "It\u2019s also probably where she automatically ran to before she realized someone was in the shower.", "She was probably crying from throwing up and embarrassment. When I puke it takes such a toll on my body I start crying too. Plus she realized what she had done and that she was now occupying a space with her daughters naked boyfriend.", "I mean maybe, but I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cdefinitely\u201d. I rarely puke but I ALWAYS cry afterwards for some strange reason, lol (and 90% of the time, I am sober)", "I mean...it's very possible it wasn't a lie lol. That scene from Bridesmaids was what came to my mind. It happens lol", "The worst food poisoning I have ever had hit me while I was at an office party. I'm not a big drinker (never more than 2) and still we all attributed it to the alcohol at first. Until I continued to be so sick for days that I couldn't keep down water.", "Idk man. I recently ate something bad and threw up from it and I did cry after. I generally cry after I throw up. My body just does it because it\u2019s such a violent process.", "Food poisoning takes time to come on, gotta digest it to get sick as well. Unless you eat something completely foul and chuck it up on the spot.", "Did the mom know that though? I don\u2019t see it mentioned and if she was drunk from the party she may have thought there was a good chance it was one of her family members and not the boyfriend", "How do you know it's occupied? You're going to puke, you run to the bathroom , now it's too late when you see the door shut. If he stays in the shower where's the problem.", "Almost like alcohol affects peoples decision making and judgement, a good chance she had no clue.", "Plus when you\u2019re about to throw up, you\u2019re not thinking the most rationally. You\u2019re trying to get somewhere, anywhere. The bathroom was probably the closest option.", "Don\u2019t you put bags in your trash can? Otherwise your trash can is already disgusting and you should throw that shit out anyway.", "You just throw the trash can away after haha", "Hahaha, that was damn clever. Well-done. But in my part of the world, if the bathroom door is closed, people knock. So other than the occasional toddler, I\u2019ve never had anyone burst into a closed bathroom, and locks are a non-issue.", "I've honestly freaked out and puked into my own cupped hands a couple times.", "Or puke in a bag or trash can", "Your bathroom locks can\u2019t be opened from the outside in the US????", "My mom's ex didn't believe in toilet paper so he would bring a plastic water bottle in the shower after he shit to use as a bidet and tbh I wouldn't want to see that if it was my partner.", "You don't lock the door if you're showering in someone else's home?", "I\u2019m surprised you know the status of the lock for every person you know. I don\u2019t even know if my own family lock the door.", "You have never met ANYONE?  I find that doubtful. Whether or not you lock the bathroom door is not a common topic of conversation with colleagues and acquaintances.  (I would think it's not a normal topic of conversations with family and friends either.)", "Well, he's not showering at his own home. He's showering in someone else's home. I would lock the door in someone else's home 100% of the time.", "I mean, I'm not used to people knocking on *any* door. I don't lock the door when I'm showering unless I'm at someone else's house and that makes me feel more comfortable.", "I'm likely to wear my hair out if I'm at an event, and an event is where I'm drinking heavily.\n\nOne of my friends was throwing up into a lined wastepaper bucket, so I carefully collected and tied her hair back. She's an incredibly emotional drunk, though, and when she was done she started pulling it out, drunk-crying asking why I tied her hair back. She's a clean freak, so idk how she'd've reacted if she'd gotten sick on herself.\n\nYou didn't ask, I'm just in storytelling mode.", "It\u2019s an automatic response from me from partying with my girlfriends when I was younger. I\u2019ve definitely jumped out of the shower to hold my daughters hair when she got sick. Maybe if you\u2019ve never puked in your own hair it doesn\u2019t seem like an emergency, but I can\u2019t think of anything worse than finishing throwing up and then having to clean it out of my hair lol", "I think, had it been a medical emergency that wasn\u2019t \u201cjust puking\u201d, that would have been clear eventually, and holding her hair back wouldn\u2019t have been what was needed", "I've never heard the term turkey slapping before but I'm a huge fan of it.", "He\u2019s a good man & I love him more than anything but he\u2019s just not going to be helpful if anyone is throwing up. Can\u2019t do it. You\u2019re on your own. He is not rescuing anyone\u2019s hair. Lol", "My hair would have to be on fire for my husband to enter the bathroom while I\u2019m puking to save my hair.", "Poor Mom\u2026 she was having a really really bad day! Probably best if these people never look at each other or speak about this situation ever again.", "These people are 18. The are thinking like they are 18. The only person old enough to not really care how it looked is Mom. Who may or may not have needed/wanted a naked guy helping her while she\u2019s puking. I\u2019m saying if she was apologizing & crying \u2026 Mom probably wasn\u2019t having a lot of fun.\n\nBtw \u2014 gf is right. It was not necessary to help Mom while naked. It wasn\u2019t a good decision. Bathrooms have towels. Takes maybe 2/3 seconds to throw one around yourself. Good news though Mom\u2019s head was in the toilet bowl so she was probably fine!", "Im the same way lol I have emetophobia and the act of throwing up feels SO private and disgusting to me that I don\u2019t want anyone to see or hear or even know if I\u2019ve thrown up, my best friend learned this quick and will provide me comfort by leaving me alone and just sliding a glass of water my way", "I'm the same lol I get really irrationally angry if someone tries to comfort or help me or even watch me while I vomit and would much rather be left alone", "I highly doubt gf's mom noticed or cared he was naked if she was feeling so awful. To me this merits a \"that was weird, maybe don't do it again\" from the gf but not a lot more.", "Yea, I never know what to do when someone throws up because I personally do not want a single human in the same vicinity but I do realize not everyone is like that. So I probably end up bouncing between  uncaring cold and smothering solicitousness", "Exactly. Everybody is different. For me, I\u2019d absolutely hate to be alone, it terrifies me even more. But I don\u2019t know anything about the mom of course. So you\u2019re maybe right with NAH \ud83d\ude0a", "Completely agree. Besides, I highly doubt the mom even noticed. If she was that sick her eyes were probably glued to the toilet. \n\nI think the gf is being a little over the top and childish in her reaction. \n \nI think she should be proud her bf is so caring. Says a lot about him.\nNTA but gf needs to grow up.", "People are way over dramatizing this. I would have at least grabbed a towel but lets say she had grabbed it first and I didn't have one. I'm sure I could position myself to be out of view of the puker. Some people are turning this into one of those old Penthouse Forum letters.", "who says it was in her face? Was probably behind her holding the hair.  Its not like he was air hip thrusting her from behind when the gf barged in. Kid was doing a good deed", "I'm the same, I feel it coming on and pull my hair back. Even if there is no time to use a hair tie I still hold it back in one hand.", "Same, but I've also never had an issue just grabbing and holding my own hair if I couldn't find an elastic. But even at my sickest, I've had some warning. I've never just randomly thrown up without my stomach giving me heads up. As someone who lives with others and one bathroom, that's a blessing for me, because it also gives me time to grab a trash can as well so I don't need the bathroom.", "A)  Really, really, really stupid question, has heartburn been considered?  My kid threw up daily, even after the heartburn was diagnosed and she was taking three medications, until we figured out what the trigger food was.\n\nB) Even if you get it in your hair it's only a little bit of hair and the sink and hand soap is sufficient to get the hair clean again.", "Isn\u2019t that the entire point of this sub?", "Yeah, for sure.\n\nIf the bathroom was occupied, I'd honestly hit the bushes in the yard. \n\nIDK, the idea of throwing up in the kitchen sink viscerally repulses me. I suppose because food is prepared there.", "I'm surprised she didn't tell him to get back in the shower. Little weird she didn't tell him to back up while naked.", "Yeah I think the mom isn't any form of AH. In her (probably drunk) mind she just ran to the toilet to puke.

It brings back such bad memories lol. I ended up with Salmonella poisoning at 14. Missed 2 weeks of school. \nI was in the tub one night getting ready for bed and I just suddenly stood up and vomited in toilet. \nHere I was buck ball naked standing in a tub, already stupid weak from being sick for a week, calling for my mom saying \u201cwe need to go to the hospital now.\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSometimes your body just goes and your brain don\u2019t think.", "It was food poisoning not alcohol", "Ah, I see your part of the world has manners, I'm jealous.", "Been there. I've even ripped my own purse open and puked in that in a truly dire situation. Of all the indignities I've suffered from my garbage body and the plethora of medical interventions I've been through at least I can say that I've never had a naked teenager run to hold my hair. That would have been so beyond anything I could or would want to experience, I'd probably move to the Hebrides and never recover.", "Most USA bathroom door locks can be opened by using a toothpick/ pin in a hole on the outside.\nSome people have real locks on them.

(At least in my experience.)", "Mine can, they have a small pinhole on the outside that you can push a toothpick or whatever into in order to unlock.", "...no? What would the point of a lock be if you could open it from the outside???", "No, because everyone is an adult and has manners and doesn't go barging through doors that are closed, plus they have ears and can hear that a shower is running. If I'm in the bathroom pooping and there's teenagers/kids around yes, because they don't knock, but otherwise my family and friends have been taught to knock first.

For whatever reason I didn\u2019t have the presence of mind to ask him to pull over, yet I knew I couldn\u2019t puke in his car. So I chose to partially unzip my leather jacket and puke into it instead. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f luckily when i got home my sister was there and stopped me from sleeping on brick stairs outside and helped me undress.

Is just the sight of a naked person of the opposite sex really that big of a deal?", "I have to agree. I had food poisoning recently, and when you feel so nauseous you can't speak and are spewing chunks every few minutes nothing on the planet would be \"sexy\" or even remind you of intimacy. GFs mom probably didn't notice the naked BF, and likely wouldn't have cared either way.\n\nIf it wasn't sexual and there are no other weird red flags then obviously NTA. Gf should move on and not be upset.\n\nBut in the future, you may want to consider how nakedness affects others.

I just think it's so weird. She wasn't hurt or dieing and I feel like jumping out of the shower, dick hanging, to hold his girlfriends mother's hair is weird.

I'm not saying he was trying to fuck her or get a bj. I'm not saying he had ill intentions. It obviously really upset the girlfriend. Is she wrong for being upset? The mom wasn't dieing.
