He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.\n\nWhenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\".\n\nMy wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679324186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wkxwo/aita_for_wanting_my_pregnant_wife_to_see_a_less/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds as though your wife appreciates how respectful he is towards her, compared to you. \n\nWe have a vet whose blunt manner I don't care for, but he's a very experienced and skilled vet. So I keep going to him for my dog's wellbeing.\n\nRightly or wrongly, you might not care for this guy, but then you are not pregnant and requiring medical care. You need to butt out of this and let your wife - who sounds perfectly rational to me - decide who she goes to.", "YTA \n\nYour wife chooses the doctor, she\u2019s the pregnant one and her comfort outweighs yours.\n\nYou sound like the main issue is that he makes you feel insecure and that\u2019s a solid you problem.", "YTA Her opinion is the only one that matters. My mom had severe health issues. She has had doctors with poor bedside manners, but they are the reason she lived as long as she did.", "YTA - it sucks that he's kind of a jerk but so many bad things can happen in pregnancy and childbirth when a dr doesn't listen to the patient when something is wrong and this guy seems to respect your wife and have a good rapport with her, which can be very hard to find especially this late in a pregnancy", "YTA if your wife is comfortable with him, and likes him, that\u2019s all that matters. He is her OBGYN, not yours. And honestly sounds like you\u2019re the one with the problem.", "YTA. It's fine that you don't like the doctor, but I also feel like it's not really your choice to make. It's your wife who is pregnant, and I think she's absolutely right that finding another doctor is very stressful in the middle of a pregnancy. Good doctors are hard to find to begin with, so if she feels this doctor is good and trusts him, then it's wrong to pressure her to switch.\n\nI also feel like some of your reasoning for wanting to switch is a little weird. If he's not respectful to you, that's one thing. However, you made a point to note how physically fit and imposing he is.

Your wife likes him and he is encouraging and supporting in his interactions with her. I'm not sure what his physical presence has to do with anything, unless you're upset that he's taller than you. \n\nIt is vital that your wife feels comfortable with her medical team during pregnancy, as she is the one having to grow a human and push them out. You have very little say in this.", "YTA, when you\u2019re carrying the baby, you can choose what doctors to go to. Otherwise, she gets final say over her reproductive health period full stop.", "YTA  \nYour wife likes him and she is right, it's hard and stressful to change doctors during a pregnancy. If you don't like him, then stop attending the visits. You can just go on the important ones or just let her update you.", "YTA - your wife is right. It is very stressful switching OB/GYN mid pregnancy when she\u2019s happy with her current doctor. And being comfortable with and trusting her OB/GYN is critical during this time. Asking her to switch because of your own insecurities rather than incompetence seems ridiculous.\n\nIt\u2019s also disturbingly common for doctors to dumb down answers to an idiot level - especially for pregnancies. When my wife was pregnant, 90% of the  questions we asked was answered by \u201cdon\u2019t worry - that\u2019s normal\u201d rather than any sort of explanation. I think they think they\u2019re being reassuring to frightened parents to-be, but they really come across as condescending AHs.\n\nOf course, he turns that horrible act off when he\u2019s talking to another health practitioner since he knows she understands.\n\nAlso, as a nurse, your wife already knows MANY doctors are condescending pricks, so she likely has a far greater tolerance for that type of behavior.", "YTA. I\u2019ll be fair, though: you can choose the doctor when you\u2019re carrying the baby in you, and your wife would be the AH if she protested your choice.", "YTA \nI don\u2019t like the sound of the doctor either.

He is NOT YOUR DOCTOR.", "\u201cMy wife seems to really like him\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s everything right there. He\u2019s your wife\u2019s doctor, she likes him, that\u2019s it.

Just sit quietly during the appointment and get on with your day.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is the patient. You have ZERO say in who she chooses as her doctor.\n\nIf you are offended by how you are being treated, grow a pair and draw some boundaries. I'm not saying get aggro with your wife's doc. I'm saying calmly say \"ok, doc, no need to talk down to me\". Or, the wimpy way out: eye roll and \"whatever\" and turn to your wife to focus on her.\n\nIt's more than likely that doc isn't being threatening, but your insecurity makes you feel threatened. This is your issue to own. Not your wife's, not the doc's.", "YTA. You can choose the doctor when you\u2019re the one about to push a watermelon sized object out of your body with multiple people watching. Until then sit down and let your wife get the care she needs from a doctor she trusts.", "YTA. This is not about you. Pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum are some of the most vulnerable moments in a woman\u2019s life and she deserves to have the care team she feels most comfortable with. If she trusts him as her doctor and has no problems with his bedside manner, you need to get over how he makes you feel.", "what a major asshole you are.\nif you want to be respected what about trying to understand what your wife is experiencing and try to help her. It\u2019s basic biology", "YTA. I\u2019ll admit, the doctor does sound difficult and I understand your frustration, however pregnancy and childbirth are extremely stressful and what\u2019s most important is if your wife feels comfortable, not you.", "It's \"unfair\" you can't pick her OB? Grow up...you're green with envy. YTA.", "YTA. She is the one carrying the baby, not you.

I'm also wondering if he handed you two a book recommendation and you skipped reading it and the answers to all your questions have been in that book. There's plenty of books available on what to expect during pregnancy, heck theres podcasts, YouTube videos, and whole websites available. Also, Dr is there to address the concerns of the patient, and as long as the patient can speak for themselves the visitors are generally not going to get much time or attention.", "YTA. She is good with this doctor, she keeps the doctor. Quite frankly, with some of the stuff that happens during birth or C-section, you want a strong doctor. The pregnancy makes her irrational? No sir. Do you want a doctor that doesn't validate her experience? Or one that doesn't tell her she's doing well when she's doing well? \n\nI had one OB who was very stern and it was the worst appointment I ever had. Very glad I never had to see that guy again.", "YTA. She\u2019s the pregnant one, she gets to choose her doctor. No one else. \n\nI\u2019d also like to point out your complaint about the doctor being condescending to you\u2026that\u2019s how a lot of doctors are to their female patients all the time. You\u2019re getting a micro dose of what many women experience.", "YTA it\u2019s so hard for women to find a doctor they are comfortable with especially when it comes to reproductive health. If she\u2019s comfortable and feels he\u2019s doing a good job keeping her and the baby healthy she should NOT change doctors", "YWBTA. She needs to be comfortable with her OB/GYN. She likes him. She says it would be stressful to switch now. **Listen to her.** It isn't unfair to listen to her - you're not the one that has to get up on the table, in those stirrups - she is. \n\nNext time you go in, CARRY HER purse for her into that doctor's appointment, and make a point to let the doctor know you're carrying her purse to help her out. The two of you started out on the wrong foot, but YOU need to be the bigger person to make the relationship work (for your wife's sake), at least for however long until the baby arrives.", "It's hard to imagine being ok with someone putting my partner down, especially when we're about to be parenting together. I think it would be good to do some soul-searching. Your short narrative showed you not carrying things for her, evaluating her doctor solely based on how YOU feel about him and using that to try to get her to switch doctors. You might be an equal partner in this, but you're not making it sound like that. Has your wife tried before to tell you to think more about her and the baby?", "YTA. Pregnancy can be difficult and scary and your wife found a doctor that makes her comfortable. That is all that matters. It\u2019s not about you, has nothing to do with you, and you need to suck it up and support her while she creates your child(ren).", "YTA. Are you pregnant? No? Then what you  think has no bearing on her doctor of her choosing. Her being a medical professional, stay in your lane", "*\"...because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\"*\n\nI see why her doctor treats you the way he does. \n\nYTA.", "I was on your side in the beginning. I would be extremely aggravated if someone was to interject themselves into my relationship in an attempt to scold me for not carrying my wife\u2019s purse. Your entire description of him really does make him sound like a white knight in a lab coat. However you lost me at emotional and irrational. Some could say you\u2019re being emotional and irrational for wanting to change doctors simply because he makes you feel uncomfortable.", "NAH. \n\nListen, there is nothing wrong with you wanting to feel respected and spoken to in a manner that reflects that. \n\n*However*, pregnancy is something that is happening *to* your wife and it is happening adjacent to you. Your wife is the one who needs to feel like her medical care is in the right hands because she is the one carrying and ultimately delivering your child, she is not being irrational here. \n\nSo where do you go from here? I'm going be a jerk and say it, suck it up buttercup. Either have a one to one with the doctor and let him know that you don't feel like you're getting adequate information that *you* need because of his delivery, or you need to allow your wife the space to go to her appointments solo and fill you in as needed. Heck, she can even ask to record the appointment so that nothing gets lost in translation.", "YTA because it's her having the baby not you. What kind of questions are you asking that your wife couldn't answer? If she is a nurse, she should be fairly knowledgeable about what is happening to her.", "YTA. sure, the dr is being a bit of a dick to you, but is that compromising your wife\u2019s care at all? she seems happy with her level of care with this dr and that should be all that matters. she\u2019s well looked after and feels comfortable- that should be enough reason to keep him on her medical team. your emotions don\u2019t play into this.", "YTA.

If your wife is happy with the doctor, then the wife keeps the doctor.  Your insecurity is not the deciding factor.", "YTA your wife is right she\u2019s the patient so her wants matter and yours don\u2019t. Beyond that when I was pregnant my doctor left half way through and I didn\u2019t have a say. It was very stressful just being assigned a new doctor and having to get to know someone and trust them mid pregnancy. I couldn\u2019t imagine choosing to do that.", "YTA - you have to put your faith in your wife here. If you have a generally loving and support marriage, do you think your wife would allow someone to be rude or condescending to her husband? \n\nIf the above is true -  then either you are over analyzing or misinterpreting the dr behavior or you have given the dr a reason to act this way toward you. I would encourage you to explore which option it is.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that the first thing you mention about the doctor is that he is \"very tall and fit\" screams this is more about your insecurities than the doctor actually being rude. If you've made up your mind to not like the guy because he's more physically attractive than you, of course you are going to perceive everything he does as an intentional attack on you.\n\nDid you ever even tell him your first name? He knows your last name (assuming your wife took your last name)  from your wife's medical chart. And he clearly doesn't have to remember her first name as it's also written on the chart. It's not hard to imagine the difficulty of remembering a bunch of names as a doctor with many patients, especially in a field where there is a high likelihood your patient will be accompanied by a partner. \n\nIt's already hard enough finding a doctor who is taking new patients, let alone finding one you like and feel comfortable with.\n\nIf the doctor is capable/competent and providing good medical care for your wife and baby, WHY do you care how he makes you feel??? The important thing is the health and safety of your wife and baby...NOT your feelings.", "YTA. \n\nHER pregnancy and HER doctor and HER body are not about YOU. Like congrats on the baby, but she is doing all the hard work here on out and it's her health and life at risk so SHE gets to call the shots medically.

However, if what you\u2019re saying is true regarding the doctor, he\u2019s also an AH and I think any partner who allows you to be treated that way without speaking up is also an AH.", "YTA\n\nshe's going to push a human being the size of a watermelon weighing between 6-10lbs out a hole that is the size of a bagel OR have said human being cut from her womb. yeah her comfort trumps yours. maybe he's a bad fit for you.\n\ni have docs i love that others hate and others have docs they love that i thought were atrocious.\n\nbut how is it unfair that HER medical doctor should be one SHE likes. this isn't YOUR medical apt. they are all hers as the person doing the gestating. in fact until that baby takes first breath all of babies stats are part of her medical records and up to her whole they are shared with.\n\nyou literally called her irrational for not agreeing with you.", "There is no \"we\".  The doctor is her doctor, not yours.", "YTA\n\nFor calling her, \u201cemotional and irrational\u201d alone!", "Are you the one giving birth? No? Then you don\u2019t need to be comfortable. \n\nYou know what else is uncomfortable? Pushing an entire human being out of your snatch. As long as wife is comfortable with this guy then she\u2019s got no reason to switch.\n\nThe size of the man should have nothing to do with his doctoring abilities, you\u2019re just insecure. YTA", "YTA. Get the fuck over yourself.", "YTA", "Yta. I'm guessing there's a reason he doesn't like you.", "YTA She is the patient not you. She gets to choose her doctor not you. You don't have to like him so long as he supports her. That is the most important thing.", "Yeah YTA. Did you not grow up around guys? You're letting him shit talk you and instead of standing up for yourself you're whining to your wife. \nMan up, tell him if you feel disrespected again you'll take actions im apparently not allowed to endorse on here.", "YTA - it's your wife's choice. Stop letting your fragile ego get in the way.", "Unpopular opinion from the info you've givin us? NTA. If this guy is putting you down in front of your wife all the while complimenting your wife and stuff is crazy disrespectful. All these ppl saying YTA cuz she's pregnant and it's her choice is nuts. You don't just drop consideration for relationship boundaries cuz your having a baby. If this man is blatantly disrespecting you, your wife should give a shit.", "It sounds like OP may have made up his mind about the doctor before actually meeting him. Did anyone else read the first lines and think that part of the problem was the OB being a larger guy than OP?", "I totally agree. Gotta wonder if the OP has made comments like that around the doctor and the doctor just doesn't like him.", "Same. I was pretty on board with N A H until I read that line. Now I think YTA", "Was OP trying to make himself come off like a contemptible weenie?", "I thought exactly the same thing maybe the doctor really does see something in you that is bad\n\nYTA it's true shes the one carrying a watermelon in her belly the day you carry a baby and have to push it out you can start getting attitude", "I felt the same maybe OP is misreading things too like some doctors like to make jokes and be funny, a person with humor sense and open mind wouldn't mind it meanwhile someone who think highly of themselves and is fill of themselves would. OP feel like he falls in the 2nd category. Also, the last name part could be how OP is around the doc like if he is giving off egoistic energy then off the doc would call you by last name and the medicine part like ik nothing about them so I ask stupid questions and doctors would explain it to me slowly with examples that I can correlate with. \n\nSeems like OP is the one being emotional and irrational here!", "Same. I was pretty on board with N A H until I read that line. Now I think YTA", "It sounds like the OP has some valid concerns about how the doctor is communicating with him. They (doc, wife and OP) are all supposed to be on the same team here and it's also the OP's baby. Difficult patients and family come with the territory, doctor needs to communicate better. \n\nThat said OP, your wife is going through a life threatening medical procedure. It's much more important she is comfortable with her doctor than you.", "Definite jealousy vibes going on here.", "why should he carry his wife's purse because their asshole doctors insists, and when he raises concerns how the doctor treats him like a POS its his fault. why does his wife sit idly by and let her spouse get talked to like a 5 year old? would you let your spouse be treated like a child by a doctor?", "He\u2019s not an equal partner in this, he isn\u2019t the one growing the kid and then giving birth", "Being emotional for not wanting a Dr that makes you uncomfortable? Look, I totally think the wife's comfort is the priority here. \n\nMaybe op is just being a total donk about the whole thing. Or maybe his wife is acting on heightened emotions and being \"irrational.\" she did tell him his opinion didn't matter about the whole thing.\n\nI just can't get past how op's being dismissed so easily here.  Who wouldn't be upset over not only being treated as a burden and worse at the Dr's while simultaneously being told by his wife, she doesn't care. He's there to support his wife and being shit on for it.\n\n If he's so inconsequential, why does he even need to go?", "Couldnt have said it better", "No, the next time, she should still get to decide who she is most comfortable with. OP's biggest concern seems to be that he's physically fit. Sounds like he's the emotional one.", "Before you get her pregnant!", "An \u201cNTA\u201d judgment means the other party in the conflict (his wife) is an asshole. His wife is not an asshole. Your judgment should be NAH.", "Yeah, I read this whole thing as \"the doctor is way hotter than me and I don't like him seeing my wife naked so I'm going to make up some other shit\".", "Everyone knows that a tall fit doctor is a shit doctor.", "Oh yes, OP is mad he can\u2019t be the biggest guy in the room when his ignorance is highlighted.", "While I did think that at first, once OP went into the demeanor of this guy, I absolutely agree with OP and think he's being unprofessional as a doctor.\n\nNote - I am not saying that they should switch doctors, given that OPs wife likes him or that OP isn't an asshole here, he is, for that emotional and irrational line.", "Sorry, I corrected you on the gender then realised I'm the one with Brain of Fog! \ud83d\ude02", "He certainly nailed it if so.", "Eh, while I don't agree with OP here and do think he's an asshole, I'm not really getting the fun/playful vibe from this doctor as OP has described him. I'm definitely getting more of a rude/dismissive vibe.", "Because the doctor is managing a medical condition that\u2019s way more important than your spouse\u2019s feelings. OP feeling respected by the doctor isn\u2019t even in the top ten most important considerations here.", "I would agree that she should get the final say. I guess I more meant, there's an opportunity in between pregnancies to find someone they both like. Which would be the ideal situation.", "You\u2019re getting the story from OP, so of course that\u2019s how it sounds. OP isn\u2019t going to say, \u201cI think he was trying to joke around but I chose to take offense.\u201d", "I\u2019m with you. Not sure why you\u2019re getting downvoted, but OP is allowed to share how he feels that he is being treated. I wouldn\u2019t appreciate my OB treating my husband like that either. \n\nIf your wife likes him, then you\u2019re on your own, don\u2019t push it any further. I don\u2019t bring my husband to all appointments, only the important ones. Is your wife ok going by herself?\n\nNAH is my opinion. You\u2019re allowed to request for a change, your wife is allowed to say no.", "Right, but this is still the only perspective of the story that any of us are gonna get, what else am I/we supposed to base our thoughts/judgement on?\n\nAnd why wouldn't OP say that? Sure, he wouldn't say the 'choose to take offense' part, but why wouldn't OP say \"the doctor was joking around and I thought it was offensive/unprofessional/whatever\"?", "I like to use some healthy skepticism of OP\u2019s self-characterizations and assume they\u2019re (at least subconsciously if not deliberately) positioning themselves to look better\u2014not necessarily lying, but definite puffery. Favorable assumptions go to the party who didn\u2019t write the post.", "Hmm, I usually assume the opposite. Simply the fact that someone posted here, meaning they have the self awareness to wonder if they're the asshole or not, is enough for me to look favorably on them.", "Except that sometimes it's more like \"no one agrees with me -- tell me I'm right!\" and not self-awareness.", "Yes, we do see that kind of thing on occasion.\n\nI did not get the impression that was the case here.", "I mean, you're free to have your impression. I don't see how a self-aware person would need to make this post at all."]}
