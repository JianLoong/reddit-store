He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.\n\nWhenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\".\n\nMy wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679324186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wkxwo/aita_for_wanting_my_pregnant_wife_to_see_a_less/", "score": 860, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You saying she's \"emotional and irrational\" for having this boundary makes me think her doctor thinks poorly of you for a reason.", "YTA, for calling your wife 'emotional and irrational' and for 'insisting' that she change her doctor. It sounds as though your wife appreciates how respectful he is towards her, compared to you. \n\nWe have a vet whose blunt manner I don't care for, but he's a very experienced and skilled vet. So I keep going to him for my dog's wellbeing.\n\nRightly or wrongly, you might not care for this guy, but then you are not pregnant and requiring medical care. You need to butt out of this and let your wife - who sounds perfectly rational to me - decide who she goes to.", "YTA \n\nYour wife chooses the doctor, she\u2019s the pregnant one and her comfort outweighs yours.\n\nYou sound like the main issue is that he makes you feel insecure and that\u2019s a solid you problem.", "YTA Her opinion is the only one that matters. My mom had severe health issues. She has had doctors with poor bedside manners, but they are the reason she lived as long as she did.", "YTA - it sucks that he's kind of a jerk but so many bad things can happen in pregnancy and childbirth when a dr doesn't listen to the patient when something is wrong and this guy seems to respect your wife and have a good rapport with her, which can be very hard to find especially this late in a pregnancy", "YTA if your wife is comfortable with him, and likes him, that\u2019s all that matters. He is her OBGYN, not yours. And honestly sounds like you\u2019re the one with the problem.", "YTA. It's fine that you don't like the doctor, but I also feel like it's not really your choice to make. It's your wife who is pregnant, and I think she's absolutely right that finding another doctor is very stressful in the middle of a pregnancy. Good doctors are hard to find to begin with, so if she feels this doctor is good and trusts him, then it's wrong to pressure her to switch.\n\nI also feel like some of your reasoning for wanting to switch is a little weird. If he's not respectful to you, that's one thing. However, you made a point to note how physically fit and imposing he is. That makes it kind of sound like you have ulterior motives or reasons for wanting her to switch doctors.", "Your wife has a good relationship with her obstetrician.

First for calling your wife \"emotional\" when it's YOUR emotions causing the problem!!\n\nBeyond that, this is her doctor. Whatever you think of him, SHE is comfortable with his care. Her body is the one one the line, so it's her choice who she sees.\n\nAnd you are weirded out that he calls your wife by her name? She's his  *patient*.

Your wife likes him and he is encouraging and supporting in his interactions with her. I'm not sure what his physical presence has to do with anything, unless you're upset that he's taller than you. \n\nIt is vital that your wife feels comfortable with her medical team during pregnancy, as she is the one having to grow a human and push them out. You have very little say in this.", "YTA, when you\u2019re carrying the baby, you can choose what doctors to go to. Otherwise, she gets final say over her reproductive health period full stop.", "YTA  \nYour wife likes him and she is right, it's hard and stressful to change doctors during a pregnancy. If you don't like him, then stop attending the visits. You can just go on the important ones or just let her update you.", "YTA - your wife is right. It is very stressful switching OB/GYN mid pregnancy when she\u2019s happy with her current doctor. And being comfortable with and trusting her OB/GYN is critical during this time. Asking her to switch because of your own insecurities rather than incompetence seems ridiculous.\n\nIt\u2019s also disturbingly common for doctors to dumb down answers to an idiot level - especially for pregnancies. When my wife was pregnant, 90% of the  questions we asked was answered by \u201cdon\u2019t worry - that\u2019s normal\u201d rather than any sort of explanation. I think they think they\u2019re being reassuring to frightened parents to-be, but they really come across as condescending AHs.\n\nOf course, he turns that horrible act off when he\u2019s talking to another health practitioner since he knows she understands.\n\nAlso, as a nurse, your wife already knows MANY doctors are condescending pricks, so she likely has a far greater tolerance for that type of behavior.", "YTA. I\u2019ll be fair, though: you can choose the doctor when you\u2019re carrying the baby in you, and your wife would be the AH if she protested your choice.", "YTA \nI don\u2019t like the sound of the doctor either.

He is NOT YOUR DOCTOR.", "\u201cMy wife seems to really like him\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s everything right there. He\u2019s your wife\u2019s doctor, she likes him, that\u2019s it.

Your wife's comfort and trust with her doctor are more important than your personality clash with him. She's going to attend most appointments solo anyway. Just sit quietly during the appointment and get on with your day.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is the patient. You have ZERO say in who she chooses as her doctor.\n\nIf you are offended by how you are being treated, grow a pair and draw some boundaries. I'm not saying get aggro with your wife's doc. I'm saying calmly say \"ok, doc, no need to talk down to me\". Or, the wimpy way out: eye roll and \"whatever\" and turn to your wife to focus on her.\n\nIt's more than likely that doc isn't being threatening, but your insecurity makes you feel threatened. This is your issue to own. Not your wife's, not the doc's.", "YTA. You can choose the doctor when you\u2019re the one about to push a watermelon sized object out of your body with multiple people watching. Until then sit down and let your wife get the care she needs from a doctor she trusts.", "YTA. This is not about you. Pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum are some of the most vulnerable moments in a woman\u2019s life and she deserves to have the care team she feels most comfortable with.

It\u2019s basic biology", "YTA. I\u2019ll admit, the doctor does sound difficult and I understand your frustration, however pregnancy and childbirth are extremely stressful and what\u2019s most important is if your wife feels comfortable, not you.", "It's \"unfair\" you can't pick her OB? Grow up...you're green with envy. YTA.", "YTA. She is the one carrying the baby, not you.

I'm also wondering if he handed you two a book recommendation and you skipped reading it and the answers to all your questions have been in that book. There's plenty of books available on what to expect during pregnancy, heck theres podcasts, YouTube videos, and whole websites available. Also, Dr is there to address the concerns of the patient, and as long as the patient can speak for themselves the visitors are generally not going to get much time or attention.", "YTA. She is good with this doctor, she keeps the doctor. Quite frankly, with some of the stuff that happens during birth or C-section, you want a strong doctor. The pregnancy makes her irrational? No sir. Do you want a doctor that doesn't validate her experience? Or one that doesn't tell her she's doing well when she's doing well? \n\nI had one OB who was very stern and it was the worst appointment I ever had. Very glad I never had to see that guy again.", "YTA. She\u2019s the pregnant one, she gets to choose her doctor. No one else. \n\nI\u2019d also like to point out your complaint about the doctor being condescending to you\u2026that\u2019s how a lot of doctors are to their female patients all the time. You\u2019re getting a micro dose of what many women experience.", "YTA it\u2019s so hard for women to find a doctor they are comfortable with especially when it comes to reproductive health. If she\u2019s comfortable and feels he\u2019s doing a good job keeping her and the baby healthy she should NOT change doctors", "YWBTA. She needs to be comfortable with her OB/GYN. She likes him. She says it would be stressful to switch now. **Listen to her.** It isn't unfair to listen to her - you're not the one that has to get up on the table, in those stirrups - she is. \n\nNext time you go in, CARRY HER purse for her into that doctor's appointment, and make a point to let the doctor know you're carrying her purse to help her out. The two of you started out on the wrong foot, but YOU need to be the bigger person to make the relationship work (for your wife's sake), at least for however long until the baby arrives.", "It's hard to imagine being ok with someone putting my partner down, especially when we're about to be parenting together. I think it would be good to do some soul-searching. Your short narrative showed you not carrying things for her, evaluating her doctor solely based on how YOU feel about him and using that to try to get her to switch doctors. You might be an equal partner in this, but you're not making it sound like that. Has your wife tried before to tell you to think more about her and the baby?", "YTA. Pregnancy can be difficult and scary and your wife found a doctor that makes her comfortable. That is all that matters. It\u2019s not about you, has nothing to do with you, and you need to suck it up and support her while she creates your child(ren).", "YTA. Are you pregnant? No? Then what you  think has no bearing on her doctor of her choosing. Her being a medical professional, stay in your lane", "*\"...because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\"*\n\nI see why her doctor treats you the way he does. \n\nYTA.", "I was on your side in the beginning. I would be extremely aggravated if someone was to interject themselves into my relationship in an attempt to scold me for not carrying my wife\u2019s purse. Your entire description of him really does make him sound like a white knight in a lab coat. However you lost me at emotional and irrational. Some could say you\u2019re being emotional and irrational for wanting to change doctors simply because he makes you feel uncomfortable.", "NAH. \n\nListen, there is nothing wrong with you wanting to feel respected and spoken to in a manner that reflects that. \n\n*However*, pregnancy is something that is happening *to* your wife and it is happening adjacent to you. Your wife is the one who needs to feel like her medical care is in the right hands because she is the one carrying and ultimately delivering your child, she is not being irrational here. \n\nSo where do you go from here? I'm going be a jerk and say it, suck it up buttercup. Either have a one to one with the doctor and let him know that you don't feel like you're getting adequate information that *you* need because of his delivery, or you need to allow your wife the space to go to her appointments solo and fill you in as needed. Heck, she can even ask to record the appointment so that nothing gets lost in translation.", "YTA because it's her having the baby not you. What kind of questions are you asking that your wife couldn't answer? If she is a nurse, she should be fairly knowledgeable about what is happening to her.", "YTA. sure, the dr is being a bit of a dick to you, but is that compromising your wife\u2019s care at all? she seems happy with her level of care with this dr and that should be all that matters. she\u2019s well looked after and feels comfortable- that should be enough reason to keep him on her medical team. your emotions don\u2019t play into this.", "YTA.

If your wife is happy with the doctor, then the wife keeps the doctor.  Your insecurity is not the deciding factor.", "YTA your wife is right she\u2019s the patient so her wants matter and yours don\u2019t. Beyond that when I was pregnant my doctor left half way through and I didn\u2019t have a say. It was very stressful just being assigned a new doctor and having to get to know someone and trust them mid pregnancy. I couldn\u2019t imagine choosing to do that.", "YTA - you have to put your faith in your wife here. If you have a generally loving and support marriage, do you think your wife would allow someone to be rude or condescending to her husband? \n\nIf the above is true -  then either you are over analyzing or misinterpreting the dr behavior or you have given the dr a reason to act this way toward you. I would encourage you to explore which option it is.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that the first thing you mention about the doctor is that he is \"very tall and fit\" screams this is more about your insecurities than the doctor actually being rude. If you've made up your mind to not like the guy because he's more physically attractive than you, of course you are going to perceive everything he does as an intentional attack on you.\n\nDid you ever even tell him your first name? He knows your last name (assuming your wife took your last name)  from your wife's medical chart. And he clearly doesn't have to remember her first name as it's also written on the chart. It's not hard to imagine the difficulty of remembering a bunch of names as a doctor with many patients, especially in a field where there is a high likelihood your patient will be accompanied by a partner. \n\nIt's already hard enough finding a doctor who is taking new patients, let alone finding one you like and feel comfortable with.\n\nIf the doctor is capable/competent and providing good medical care for your wife and baby, WHY do you care how he makes you feel??? The important thing is the health and safety of your wife and baby...NOT your feelings.", "YTA. \n\nHER pregnancy and HER doctor and HER body are not about YOU.

He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.\n\nWhenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\".\n\nMy wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When it came time to give birth - he was awesome.  He was there for me, not my husband.

Because labor and delivery is allllll about her and that baby.  Yes, this will be your baby, but this is her body, and this is all about her and the baby - their lives are on the line.  Until the child comes out - it is not about you.  I worked in a hospital for 13 years - work in a clinic now.  Usually, a doctor treats both parents to be the same unless there is a sense that maybe dad is not taking care of mom.  *There is a reason why he is treating you differently and it is not because Lily is emotional and irrational.*  His job is to ensure she is ok and that the baby is okay.  \n\nI had two easy births and then I had one horrendous birth.  I went into it thinking I would have a 3rd great birth and walk out of there with a baby.  Instead, I ended up in emergency surgery - due to hemorrhaging, after struggling to push a baby (apparently, she was a cork and once she was out- that cork was gone) out because I darn near bleed out.  My baby also needed to be taken by emergency transport to another city/hospital because she had heart defect that is the hardest to detect even with weekly scans - which I was because I was high risk.  Our bodies are built for birth but until recent history - lots of ladies such as myself died along with our babies because as natural as birth is - sometimes things go wrong during that birth.  Use to be that males were catered to and given input for female decisions - think house of dragon - but now - it is not about the men - it is the women are need the focus and it is the women who decide.  So, leave her be.  This is who she wants.  \n\nAnd ask yourself - what is the doctor picking up about you that is causing him to call you Mr. \\*\\*\\*\\*.  My husband was grateful when stuff went south that he got ignored when everything went from fine to not fine in a matter of a literal minute, because he watched me, and our child get immediate and lifesaving attention.  When you are in a situation where a code starts - and yes in the medical world codes are part of daily life, you have to push thru and then regroup and hope that everything you did helped.

For one thing, OP should be offering to carry stuff for his pregnant wife!", "That explains so much of why nurses will refer her name or mom and dad when they give directions.", "Ahhh I loved the anecdote at the end thanks for that", "No her feelings are irrational and she should cater to my insecurities /s", "My uncle is like that. He can\u2019t meet with patients directly or he gets medical board complaints about how rude he is. But he\u2019s so good at his job that he gets requests for consultations from all over the place because he can diagnose the undiagnosable. Luckily, he is in a field that doesn\u2019t actually require meeting with the patient (radiology). My mom used to joke all the time that he\u2019s the real life Dr. House.", "I totally agree about her probably knowing he\u2019s a good doctor and she feels safe with him, even if he\u2019s kind of a jerk. Her feeling safe and comfortable with him is all that matters!\n\nYour dermatologist sounds kinda similar to my neurologist. He has a reputation for his unique bedside manner and strange jokes. He is pretty no nonsense and will fully call out patients who are wasting his time, not listening etc. He is easily distracted and doesn\u2019t want to waste time because he runs a clinic and is the head of neurology at a hospital. He doesn\u2019t have time for nonsense. This can come across poorly when you first meet him. \n\nThe thing is though, he is brilliant!!! He was able to diagnose me and get me on the right treatments with multiple very rare degenerative neurological disorders. I had been sick for 12+ years and seen over 15 different neurologists who all dismissed me as crazy before I met him. He was able to help me in a couple months! He literally saved my life. \n\nNow that I have gotten to know him I understand why he acts the way he does and we have become quite close. The last time I was hospitalized he visited me every day, even when he wasn\u2019t doing rounds and stood up for me when the other doctors were not listening to me. My fianc\u00e9 even worked with him for a few years. I trust him more than any doctor I\u2019ve ever had! He is the reason I am alive and was able to get out of being a full time wheelchair user. Yeah he\u2019s a bit strange but he\u2019s a genius!", "And I get that. But is it so hard to be nice to the father to be? I realize it\u2019s not hip or cool to just be nice and respectful but the doctor should be filling OP in.", "OP also mentions that he compliments his wife on *how well she's handling her pregnancy*. The surname got to me a little. Living in the UK I took this to mean he's being addressed as Surname and not Mr Surname. That's definitely rude.", "Yes. The first \"complaint\" being that he's tall and fit made me scoff.", ">Yeah some doctors are jerks, but OP also reeks of insecurity and jealousy here\n\nExactly my point (though I really wish was just *some*, in my experience it's more like most). That's why I put that last bit in bold. OP 100% deserves his verdict here, just not based alone on the fact that he thought the Dr was mean.", ">OP is trying to ask his own questions and be involved and it's really not his place to be.\n\nThat's stupid, I'm sorry. Have you not been a spouse or sibling or parent or child of a patient before? You are part of the process and for good god damn reason. There may come a time when you are the only one that can speak up for that person. It is in everyone's interest to have thoughts/concerns of SOs addressed and done so with respect.", "The purse thing was unnecessary. And yeah, I'm going to go with OP being able to tell the difference in how the doc speaks to him vs his wife. It really shouldn't be different. Maybe he *is* insecure, but any doc/nurse/attendee (male or female) we've had over three kids has tried to build up the confidence of both parties. Not that hard to do!", "Exactly, he should be treated with respect. That's literally all I'm saying. I'm not defending him making a demand, but let's be honest that this doc kind of sucks even if he is good for the wife and she likes him. The husband is NOT an insignificant part of this process and deserves to be treated as such. Also, stop shouting, good lord can't anybody discuss without getting angry.", "\ud83e\udd23\n\nI think it shows his attitude towards her\n\nEx if I had grocery bags my friends would help me with them without being asked. We would just automatically spread them out between everyone in the group. \n\nOP also said that it was a big purse, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his wife was struggling with it/sitting down\u2026 etc etc. \n\nPlus OP is a bit dismissive of his wife by saying that she doesn\u2019t have to have the discussion due to her pregnancy/ hormones. But she\u2019s probably set on him keeping him as her doctor and doesn\u2019t want to keep having the same discussion over and over again.", "Despite many people's efforts, I see my child's father as equal to me as a parent.", "Usually if i don't see responses to the comments and the account being freshly new or with no history then i usually deem it as fake.", "Radiologists are mostly a little strange lol I used to work with a lot of them and it was very rare to find one that was personable. There\u2019s a reason they chose the one specialty that left them in a dark room without people.", "IF OP is a reliable narrator, the doctor should definitely be more civil. It\u2019s not too much to ask. Poor bedside manner can negatively affect care because it can make your patients less likely to confide in you. However, OP and his wife have no control over his actions: they aren\u2019t his boss or the medical board. Their only potential course of action is to switch doctors mid pregnancy, and I don\u2019t think OP should pressure his wife into that over the doctor\u2019s rudeness. It doesn\u2019t mean the doctor is right because he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just a matter of priorities, and the priority mid pregnancy is the pregnant woman\u2019s feelings about the doctor. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure OP is a reliable narrator though. Basically what it boils down to is: the doctor is a big fit man, he compliments OP\u2019s wife, he told OP to hold his wife\u2019s purse in what very well could have been a joke, and he calls OP by his surname. The surname thing: the doctor looks at the wife\u2019s chart before he walks in. That reminds him of her first name. It likely doesn\u2019t say OP\u2019s first name, so he uses the only name he can remember: their shared last name. None of that is a problem. The only problem is the way he condescendingly talks to OP, but given the way OP is blowing the rest of it out of proportion, I think he may be blowing that part out of proportion too.", "> it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nThat could be why the doctor is giving a hard time to the husband.", "I have to wonder if the doctor just made a joke that didn\u2019t land because they didn\u2019t know each other. Something like, \u201cgeez man, you gonna let your pregnant wife carry that suitcase of a purse?\u201d\n\nWe also have to consider that everybody skews any description of a conflict to sound better in their favor, and as a friend of mine always says, \u201cthere\u2019s three sides to every story. Yours, theirs, and the truth.\u201d \n\nOf course this is speculative. But I have to wonder if the first impression being poor caused a snowball effect where everything he says was subsequently taken the wrong way. \n\nTo be fair there\u2019s a lot of info missing in the post to tell if the doctor actually has poor bedside manner or not. For example, is OP asking questions he googled because he\u2019s trying to sound smarter? If the doctor is explaining everything to him like he\u2019s 5 then I\u2019d think that sort of doctor would be patient with questions. Then again I\u2019ve met some doctors who were just really brash. \n\nI still think OP is TA because he\u2019s asking his wife to leave a doctor she feels safe with during a *major* medical event because he appears to feel emasculated by him. But the jury is out on whether the doc is really a jerk.", ">OP also said that it was a big purse\n\nSo? Is woman incapable of carrying a purse now? What's your point? The doctor made a huge assumption here that A) Wife needs husband to carry the bad or B) Husband didn't already offer. This stupid ass alpha-male crap that is probably more obvious to men than women. What he's doing is undermining the BF to elevate his own status. Same with unprofessional complements about her looks. Guys like this will knock you down no matter what you do. Hell he'd probably emasculate the guy if he did walk in with the purse. \n\n> so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his wife was struggling with it/sitting down\u2026 etc etc\n\nMore stupid assumptions.", "Well he\u2019s particularly bad even for a radiologist, if that says something.", "Lucius is a top-tier name for a sploot-potato.  I approve.", "Why wasn't he allowed to come to the cervical checkups? \n\nI'm TERRIFIED of medical stuff and the only way I could see myself being comfortable with everything surrounding pregnancy would be if my partner could be present every step of the way.", "She\u2019s pregnant\u2026? How is that a stupid assumption?", "He was allowed 100%! We were both just a little awkward about those so he sat them out. I used them as an excuse to go for a treat for myself afterwards lol", "Not when it comes at the expense of her comfort and health, no. Y\u2019all honestly think she should switch from a doctor she trusts and is comfortable with to anyone who\u2019s capable because her insecure husband can\u2019t handle feeling disrespected? You seriously think his feelings are more important than her health? That\u2019s just laughable.", "That's not my stance at all, so I'll clarify. Switching docs may suck for her or may not be possible, for sure. What is important is that if she is relying the husband to speak for her and have her wishes respected, they should be confident that what the husband has to say for her will be respected when the time comes and not just disregarded while the  medical professionals do what *they* think is best. Sometimes docs make good decisions, sometimes they don't. While this doc absolutely respects his patient, he also sounds like the kind that would just ignore the husband if the wife goes unconscious. That's concerning to me.", "In your case, it sounds like your husband doesn't have a good reason, and I don't question you not caring in that case if he likes her or not.\n\nThe doc described in the post doesn't sound like a doc that would actually work with the husband as yours did, that's what I'm trying to say. He sounds like he would just disregard the husband in those circumstances, based on what I read. That should be at least a little concerning.", "There\u2019s absolutely nothing in the OP to suggest that the doctor would not listen to the husband should something happen. He\u2019s literally complaining that the doctor has more muscles than him.", "My husband doesn\u2019t think she is \u201cprofessional enough\u201d because she and I joke around. He was not happy that she wasn\u2019t totally stiff and had a personality that meshed with mine. Which is weird because if we just knew her, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d actually like her. But because she has a lighter demeanor, it\u2019s bad. Still, when it came down to trying to prevent me and the baby from dying, she was as straight and professional as possible. And it still didn\u2019t matter. He still doesn\u2019t like her. The wife\u2019s doctor is very likely going to be a totally different person during an emergency than he is when he is just in a regular visit. \n\nThis guy can ask his wife if she will change doctors, but that\u2019s all he can do. He needs to defer to her preferences because this is not about him. It is about her. He needs to take a step back and stop centering himself in HER pregnancy. His language (we\u2019ve been seeing an obstetrician/want us to leave him/it\u2019s unfair) just says that he doesn\u2019t see this being about the relationship between his wife and HER doctor but him being in the middle of that relationship and thinking he has some control over it. And he just doesn\u2019t.", "I agree with most of what you're saying, and all he can do is make the request.\n\nBut the big difference in yours and OP's situation is that, assuming he is a reliable narrator, he isn't even getting a reasonable amount of respect in the processs.  It's not like he's checking out of the process, he's being involved and asking questions (assuming they are reasonable questions). \n\nBottom line, OP is not unreasonable for wanting to be respected by the doctor, and he should be respected (again, assuming he isn't being a d-bag himself in the appointments)."]}
