He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.\n\nWhenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\".\n\nMy wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679324186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wkxwo/aita_for_wanting_my_pregnant_wife_to_see_a_less/", "score": 407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You saying she's \"emotional and irrational\" for having this boundary makes me think her doctor thinks poorly of you for a reason.", "YTA, for calling your wife 'emotional and irrational' and for 'insisting' that she change her doctor. It sounds as though your wife appreciates how respectful he is towards her, compared to you. \n\nWe have a vet whose blunt manner I don't care for, but he's a very experienced and skilled vet. So I keep going to him for my dog's wellbeing.\n\nRightly or wrongly, you might not care for this guy, but then you are not pregnant and requiring medical care. You need to butt out of this and let your wife - who sounds perfectly rational to me - decide who she goes to.", "YTA \n\nYour wife chooses the doctor, she\u2019s the pregnant one and her comfort outweighs yours.\n\nYou sound like the main issue is that he makes you feel insecure and that\u2019s a solid you problem.", "YTA Her opinion is the only one that matters. My mom had severe health issues. She has had doctors with poor bedside manners, but they are the reason she lived as long as she did.", "YTA - it sucks that he's kind of a jerk but so many bad things can happen in pregnancy and childbirth when a dr doesn't listen to the patient when something is wrong and this guy seems to respect your wife and have a good rapport with her, which can be very hard to find especially this late in a pregnancy", "YTA if your wife is comfortable with him, and likes him, that\u2019s all that matters. He is her OBGYN, not yours. And honestly sounds like you\u2019re the one with the problem.", "YTA. It's fine that you don't like the doctor, but I also feel like it's not really your choice to make. It's your wife who is pregnant, and I think she's absolutely right that finding another doctor is very stressful in the middle of a pregnancy. Good doctors are hard to find to begin with, so if she feels this doctor is good and trusts him, then it's wrong to pressure her to switch.\n\nI also feel like some of your reasoning for wanting to switch is a little weird. If he's not respectful to you, that's one thing. However, you made a point to note how physically fit and imposing he is. That makes it kind of sound like you have ulterior motives or reasons for wanting her to switch doctors.", "Your wife has a good relationship with her obstetrician.

First for calling your wife \"emotional\" when it's YOUR emotions causing the problem!!\n\nBeyond that, this is her doctor. Whatever you think of him, SHE is comfortable with his care. Her body is the one one the line, so it's her choice who she sees.\n\nAnd you are weirded out that he calls your wife by her name? She's his  *patient*.

Your wife likes him and he is encouraging and supporting in his interactions with her. I'm not sure what his physical presence has to do with anything, unless you're upset that he's taller than you. \n\nIt is vital that your wife feels comfortable with her medical team during pregnancy, as she is the one having to grow a human and push them out. You have very little say in this.", "YTA, when you\u2019re carrying the baby, you can choose what doctors to go to. Otherwise, she gets final say over her reproductive health period full stop.", "YTA  \nYour wife likes him and she is right, it's hard and stressful to change doctors during a pregnancy. If you don't like him, then stop attending the visits. You can just go on the important ones or just let her update you.", "YTA - your wife is right. It is very stressful switching OB/GYN mid pregnancy when she\u2019s happy with her current doctor. And being comfortable with and trusting her OB/GYN is critical during this time. Asking her to switch because of your own insecurities rather than incompetence seems ridiculous.\n\nIt\u2019s also disturbingly common for doctors to dumb down answers to an idiot level - especially for pregnancies. When my wife was pregnant, 90% of the  questions we asked was answered by \u201cdon\u2019t worry - that\u2019s normal\u201d rather than any sort of explanation. I think they think they\u2019re being reassuring to frightened parents to-be, but they really come across as condescending AHs.\n\nOf course, he turns that horrible act off when he\u2019s talking to another health practitioner since he knows she understands.\n\nAlso, as a nurse, your wife already knows MANY doctors are condescending pricks, so she likely has a far greater tolerance for that type of behavior.", "YTA. I\u2019ll be fair, though: you can choose the doctor when you\u2019re carrying the baby in you, and your wife would be the AH if she protested your choice.", "YTA \nI don\u2019t like the sound of the doctor either.

He is NOT YOUR DOCTOR.", "\u201cMy wife seems to really like him\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s everything right there. He\u2019s your wife\u2019s doctor, she likes him, that\u2019s it.

Your wife's comfort and trust with her doctor are more important than your personality clash with him. She's going to attend most appointments solo anyway. Just sit quietly during the appointment and get on with your day.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is the patient. You have ZERO say in who she chooses as her doctor.\n\nIf you are offended by how you are being treated, grow a pair and draw some boundaries. I'm not saying get aggro with your wife's doc. I'm saying calmly say \"ok, doc, no need to talk down to me\". Or, the wimpy way out: eye roll and \"whatever\" and turn to your wife to focus on her.\n\nIt's more than likely that doc isn't being threatening, but your insecurity makes you feel threatened. This is your issue to own. Not your wife's, not the doc's.", "YTA. You can choose the doctor when you\u2019re the one about to push a watermelon sized object out of your body with multiple people watching. Until then sit down and let your wife get the care she needs from a doctor she trusts.", "YTA. This is not about you. Pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum are some of the most vulnerable moments in a woman\u2019s life and she deserves to have the care team she feels most comfortable with.

It\u2019s basic biology", "YTA. I\u2019ll admit, the doctor does sound difficult and I understand your frustration, however pregnancy and childbirth are extremely stressful and what\u2019s most important is if your wife feels comfortable, not you.", "It's \"unfair\" you can't pick her OB? Grow up...you're green with envy. YTA.", "YTA. She is the one carrying the baby, not you.

I'm also wondering if he handed you two a book recommendation and you skipped reading it and the answers to all your questions have been in that book. There's plenty of books available on what to expect during pregnancy, heck theres podcasts, YouTube videos, and whole websites available. Also, Dr is there to address the concerns of the patient, and as long as the patient can speak for themselves the visitors are generally not going to get much time or attention.", "YTA. She is good with this doctor, she keeps the doctor. Quite frankly, with some of the stuff that happens during birth or C-section, you want a strong doctor. The pregnancy makes her irrational? No sir. Do you want a doctor that doesn't validate her experience? Or one that doesn't tell her she's doing well when she's doing well? \n\nI had one OB who was very stern and it was the worst appointment I ever had. Very glad I never had to see that guy again.", "YTA. She\u2019s the pregnant one, she gets to choose her doctor. No one else. \n\nI\u2019d also like to point out your complaint about the doctor being condescending to you\u2026that\u2019s how a lot of doctors are to their female patients all the time. You\u2019re getting a micro dose of what many women experience.", "YTA it\u2019s so hard for women to find a doctor they are comfortable with especially when it comes to reproductive health. If she\u2019s comfortable and feels he\u2019s doing a good job keeping her and the baby healthy she should NOT change doctors", "YWBTA. She needs to be comfortable with her OB/GYN. She likes him. She says it would be stressful to switch now. **Listen to her.** It isn't unfair to listen to her - you're not the one that has to get up on the table, in those stirrups - she is. \n\nNext time you go in, CARRY HER purse for her into that doctor's appointment, and make a point to let the doctor know you're carrying her purse to help her out. The two of you started out on the wrong foot, but YOU need to be the bigger person to make the relationship work (for your wife's sake), at least for however long until the baby arrives.", "It's hard to imagine being ok with someone putting my partner down, especially when we're about to be parenting together. I think it would be good to do some soul-searching. Your short narrative showed you not carrying things for her, evaluating her doctor solely based on how YOU feel about him and using that to try to get her to switch doctors. You might be an equal partner in this, but you're not making it sound like that. Has your wife tried before to tell you to think more about her and the baby?", "YTA. Pregnancy can be difficult and scary and your wife found a doctor that makes her comfortable. That is all that matters. It\u2019s not about you, has nothing to do with you, and you need to suck it up and support her while she creates your child(ren).", "YTA. Are you pregnant? No? Then what you  think has no bearing on her doctor of her choosing. Her being a medical professional, stay in your lane", "*\"...because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\"*\n\nI see why her doctor treats you the way he does. \n\nYTA.", "I was on your side in the beginning. I would be extremely aggravated if someone was to interject themselves into my relationship in an attempt to scold me for not carrying my wife\u2019s purse. Your entire description of him really does make him sound like a white knight in a lab coat. However you lost me at emotional and irrational. Some could say you\u2019re being emotional and irrational for wanting to change doctors simply because he makes you feel uncomfortable.", "NAH. \n\nListen, there is nothing wrong with you wanting to feel respected and spoken to in a manner that reflects that. \n\n*However*, pregnancy is something that is happening *to* your wife and it is happening adjacent to you. Your wife is the one who needs to feel like her medical care is in the right hands because she is the one carrying and ultimately delivering your child, she is not being irrational here. \n\nSo where do you go from here? I'm going be a jerk and say it, suck it up buttercup. Either have a one to one with the doctor and let him know that you don't feel like you're getting adequate information that *you* need because of his delivery, or you need to allow your wife the space to go to her appointments solo and fill you in as needed. Heck, she can even ask to record the appointment so that nothing gets lost in translation.", "YTA because it's her having the baby not you. What kind of questions are you asking that your wife couldn't answer? If she is a nurse, she should be fairly knowledgeable about what is happening to her.", "YTA. sure, the dr is being a bit of a dick to you, but is that compromising your wife\u2019s care at all? she seems happy with her level of care with this dr and that should be all that matters. she\u2019s well looked after and feels comfortable- that should be enough reason to keep him on her medical team. your emotions don\u2019t play into this.", "YTA.

If your wife is happy with the doctor, then the wife keeps the doctor.  Your insecurity is not the deciding factor.", "YTA your wife is right she\u2019s the patient so her wants matter and yours don\u2019t. Beyond that when I was pregnant my doctor left half way through and I didn\u2019t have a say. It was very stressful just being assigned a new doctor and having to get to know someone and trust them mid pregnancy. I couldn\u2019t imagine choosing to do that.", "YTA - you have to put your faith in your wife here. If you have a generally loving and support marriage, do you think your wife would allow someone to be rude or condescending to her husband? \n\nIf the above is true -  then either you are over analyzing or misinterpreting the dr behavior or you have given the dr a reason to act this way toward you. I would encourage you to explore which option it is.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that the first thing you mention about the doctor is that he is \"very tall and fit\" screams this is more about your insecurities than the doctor actually being rude. If you've made up your mind to not like the guy because he's more physically attractive than you, of course you are going to perceive everything he does as an intentional attack on you.\n\nDid you ever even tell him your first name? He knows your last name (assuming your wife took your last name)  from your wife's medical chart. And he clearly doesn't have to remember her first name as it's also written on the chart. It's not hard to imagine the difficulty of remembering a bunch of names as a doctor with many patients, especially in a field where there is a high likelihood your patient will be accompanied by a partner. \n\nIt's already hard enough finding a doctor who is taking new patients, let alone finding one you like and feel comfortable with.\n\nIf the doctor is capable/competent and providing good medical care for your wife and baby, WHY do you care how he makes you feel??? The important thing is the health and safety of your wife and baby...NOT your feelings.", "YTA. \n\nHER pregnancy and HER doctor and HER body are not about YOU.

He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.\n\nWhenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\".\n\nMy wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When it came time to give birth - he was awesome.  He was there for me, not my husband.

Because labor and delivery is allllll about her and that baby.  Yes, this will be your baby, but this is her body, and this is all about her and the baby - their lives are on the line.  Until the child comes out - it is not about you.  I worked in a hospital for 13 years - work in a clinic now.  Usually, a doctor treats both parents to be the same unless there is a sense that maybe dad is not taking care of mom.  *There is a reason why he is treating you differently and it is not because Lily is emotional and irrational.*  His job is to ensure she is ok and that the baby is okay.  \n\nI had two easy births and then I had one horrendous birth.  I went into it thinking I would have a 3rd great birth and walk out of there with a baby.  Instead, I ended up in emergency surgery - due to hemorrhaging, after struggling to push a baby (apparently, she was a cork and once she was out- that cork was gone) out because I darn near bleed out.  My baby also needed to be taken by emergency transport to another city/hospital because she had heart defect that is the hardest to detect even with weekly scans - which I was because I was high risk.  Our bodies are built for birth but until recent history - lots of ladies such as myself died along with our babies because as natural as birth is - sometimes things go wrong during that birth.

So, leave her be.  This is who she wants.  \n\nAnd ask yourself - what is the doctor picking up about you that is causing him to call you Mr. \\*\\*\\*\\*.  My husband was grateful when stuff went south that he got ignored when everything went from fine to not fine in a matter of a literal minute, because he watched me, and our child get immediate and lifesaving attention.

No clue why it is that way, there\u2019s probably a reason, but I know it\u2019s not a rare or unusual issue either.", "That is a good question. Who knows why he is going to the appointments. However, this OB is not HIS doctor. It is not even THEIR doctor. It is HER doctor and the pregnant lady being comfortable with the doctor is way more important than the husband. This doctor is going to be seeing this lady at her absolute most vulnerable. She needs to be comfortable with that. Her comfort during pregnancy, labor, and birth must always come before his in terms of choosing a doctor to care for her. He isn\u2019t the one that is doing the heavy lifting here. Her opinion is the only one that matters because it is her health, her medical procedure and her choice. When he needs to have a doctor for his prostate, he gets to choose and she gets no say.", "It is a little wild.  I mean unless OP is greatly exaggerating, that would suck to try and be there for your wife and end being treated like a fucking imbecile.  Dude made one comment in the post about his pregnant wife being emotional (shocking!) and he gets blasted about it.  Ultimately it is her choice and he should support it, but damn maybe not pick the guy who treats the father of your child like an idiot.  ESH.", "Or he has short man energy and doesn\u2019t like that the doctor is taller", "Definitely my take too.", "Have you heard of confirmation bias?", "Maybe the  comment about OP carrying the purse as his wife's pregnancy progresses is being taken as an attack instead of an observation by the doctor. The doctor was only pointing out to OP that he will need to start thinking of assisting his partner as her pregnancy progresses.", "... I remember some parts of being a kid and if my parents had said that I don't think I'd have got the message they intended \ud83d\ude02 the very next day a roll of duct tape would definitely have mysteriously disappeared", "My OB actually encourages the partner to the pregnant person to ask questions, because the more informed they are, the better they can support the pregnant person.", "This he's making this about him. I even wonder if his questions he's asking the doctor are an attempt at manipulating the wife. \"Doctor is it safe if we keep having sex.\" When the wife doesn't want it because it's uncomfortable. Doctor I don't like her doing xyz now that she's pregnant I think it's not safe am I right?", "Umm not his place? He is allowed to have questions about his pregnant wife and HIS child. The doctor shouldn\u2019t be being rude to Op because he wants to be involved with HIS WIFE\u2019S pregnancy", "\"OP is trying to ask his own questions and be involved and its really not his place to be\"? What are you on about? Who do you think is going to be asked to make decisions if there are complications and wifey is unconscious or otherwise unable to formulate a response? It absolutely is OP's place to be just as involved in this process as the pregnant woman. The husband is not just a sperm donor, jeez.\n\nThis doc sounds like a d-bag. Through three children and several docs, nurses, and other attendees, male and female alike, I've never been disrespected like this nor has any of them made any kind of personal remark. They remained professional, and always addressed us as equally concerned parties in the pregnancy and birth process because we are just that. It's the wife's life on the line so for dang sure the husband should know what's going on and what to expect.\n\nSure, the wife must feel comfortable with the doc. We have gone out of our way to keep the same OB when she moved to a much farther away hospital. But I doubt my wife would have been comfortable with me being given the same treatment as OP. Everyone in this particular thread sound like misandrist to me. NTA, OP.", "Yes. This. Thank you. I thought I was losing my mind reading these comments. Yes ofc OP is being an AH but are we going to completely forget about the way this doctor is treating OP vs his wife ? It's gross. I'd be super uncomfortable with this.", "so that doctor is the only capable one of handling a pregnancy? again, why is OK that the wife doesn't care the doctor treats OP like child? she isn't CONSIDERING how he feels. maybe she could speak to the doctor? maybe try and get him to not be a sexist ass and treat OP like a normal person?", "Maybe he's going to understand what is going on? Part of that is being informed for when he may need to make medical decisions for his wife should complications arise. I'm really shocked at how dismissive you all are of the father is this situation. Indeed it's his wife's life on the line, and it may come down to him to make a decision if it gets to that tricky of a spot.", "My thoughts exactly", "I have, but don't see the relevance here? \n\nI did not go into reading this post wanting the doctor to be unprofessional, that's just what I got from what OP said.", "He was 11 at the time. Now my 4 year old would have the nerve to come out and ask us to help tape Lucius to her.", "My husband was able to come to all of my appointments up until they did cervical checks and my OB asked us each directly if we had questions. I think the way OP feels about the Dr is completely valid, but it's also valid that his wife's comfort comes first. If it were a question of the Dr not treating her well then that would be different", "Sure but we don't know if his questions are useful or just because OP feels the need to overly involve himself. His wife does not lose her agency when giving birth. It's telling that he thinks the Doctor is talking down to him and his wife does not see it that way.", "My Psychiatrist refers to my husband by his first name, and treats him with more respect! And I am sorry but if a doctor is going to be treating me in a situation where I may loose consciousness/be out under my husband is going to be there and involved in my medical care, just like I go with him to the neurologist because marriage does come with that added perk of automatic medical power of attorney. \n\nMy husband is my kids stepfather but he still knows their entire medical history JUST IN CASE. \n\nI find it beyond comprehension that OPs wife is so dismissive of his feelings. Because if he feels the doctor won\u2019t listen to him what happens if it comes down to a crisis? Will the doctor act in the best interests of the baby? Or sacrifice the baby to save to wife even if both could have been saved? Is the doctor hoping for that situation since lost of a child typically ends in divorce and he can \u201crescue her again like he did on the operating table\u201d :  All fears I expect op to have and he needs reassurance that his wife isn\u2019t trusting this man because he fluffs her ego.\n\nShe should have agreed to at minimum have a conversation with the doctor about boundaries and to stop complimenting her appearance.", "I\u2019m sorry but when it comes to her medical care while being pregnant and giving birth his feeling simply don\u2019t matter and she doesn\u2019t have to consider them. It\u2019s ok because she\u2019s experiencing a medical event that can be life threatening and he just has hurt feelings. Her health and survival is more important than him feeling respected.", "That is true that he may have to make decisions on her care. That happened when to me and my husband when I was in labor with our second. However, the woman\u2019s comfort with her doctor comes before the husband\u2019s comfort with her doctor. She needs to have a doctor that she can trust. It\u2019s weird that people are dismissing her feelings about her own doctor for her husband when she\u2019s the most important part of the equation.", "Before OP could even talk about his behaviors, he felt the OB was imposing physically. OPs impression of the OB was pretty much sealed before they talked.", "> Right, but this is still the only perspective of the story that any of us are gonna get, what else am I/we supposed to base our thoughts/judgement on?\n\nAll the other examples of dudes being offended by the mere concept of another dude knowing more than them.  Plus all the examples of dudes being creepy weirdoes to medical professionals that might see their partner naked.  And the fact that this OP couldn't manage to cite one actual thing this doctor did wrong yet wants his wife to switch doctors mid-pregnancy.", "Or, maybe she *does* see it as the doctor talking down to him and doesn't care, we don't know beyond what is shared in the post.\n\nBut to backtrack, I said he would be responsible for medical decisions *if* she loses her agency.", "This. The complimenting her appearance thing is odd to me, I'm not sure why he'd do that unless it's literally like she looks healthy/growing in well? Like that to me is red flags in itself. But that aside as we don't have a lot of info on it, I'd advocate for my partner in this situation well before I'd been asked to. Your spouse is an extension of yourself in many (especially legal) ways. Yes ofc you're two different people but you're supposed to take care of EACH OTHER, regardless of the situation at present. Yes I agree with people saying changing would be very stressful and ill advised but that doesn't take away from the gross and disrespectful behavior of this doctor towards OP, and wife should be bare minimum recognizing this and comforting her husband?????? \n\nIf my partner were to dismiss my feelings so wholly, how would I feel? Pretty fucking awful, tbh. Why would I want my spouse to feel that way? I wouldn't, so I wouldn't do it. A simple method, but one so few seem to employ.", "Ok, so the person who will be responsible for making medical decisions for her if she goes unconscious or can't respond doesn't deserve respect, lol. Y'all are something.", "Right, I guess what I'm getting at is that it's possible for them to both be happy with the doc. I'm speaking for my wife here, but I'm confident that if OP is a faithful narrator and this is really the treatment he is getting, and if I was treated this way, that would affect her feeling of comfort with the doctor for the aforementioned reasons when it comes to her most vulnerable moments. She would want to know that the doctor respected me on the same level, the way *our* doctors actually did, so that she felt comfortable that my opinions would be respected should she go unconscious or something. Like, if we already discussed what she would prefer in a situation and what to say if she can't respond, that my voice would be heard for her instead of them just doing whatever they want. Medical professionals aren't always completely trustworthy as a fact. It may be important for the husband to speak for her is what I'm saying, and so it *is* important that he is respected, even as the secondary party.", "Yeah but it's possible for that doctor to have been imposing physically, and still not be a dick to OP.\n\nI just don't see how the fact that OP first said he is imposing physically means that he wasn't being a dick to OP.", ">OP couldn't manage to cite one actual thing this doctor did wrong yet wants his wife to switch doctors mid-pregnancy. \n\nDid you.. Not read his post? Reads to me like the doctor did more wrong than he did right.\n\n> Whenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. \n\n> He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot.\n\n> also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\". \n\nNone of this is appropriate behavior for a doctor.", "I am coming from this as someone whose husband does not like her OB. I don\u2019t care. She has treated me with nothing but dignity and respect. She has let me come in on days when she isn\u2019t seeing patients so that she could verify pregnancy and get me started on zofran (I had HG every pregnancy). She reminds me of Mama Doctor Jones. But, my husband still has a problem with her because he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like her\u201d. Doesn\u2019t matter though. She has done everything to ensure that she will give me the best medical care possible and that I can absolutely trust her. That matters way more to me than whether or not my husband likes her. And when it came down to it, the two of them worked together to make decisions when I was unable to do so because I had complications during labor. \n\nMy guess is that she has her reasons for wanting to stay with her current doctor. She likes her doctor. She trusts her doctor. She gets to choose her doctor. He needs to back off there is no \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cour doctor\u201d in this.", "The patient is *literally fighting to keep* this doctor.  OP's feelings of inferiority are not his wife's obstetrician's problem to resolve.", "Don't get me wrong, I absolutely think OP is in the wrong to not accept that his wife likes this doctor.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the doctors behavior to OP is okay, or that the issues OP has with this doctor are caused by any feelings of inferiority.", "Really? Because that\u2019s exactly how I read it. He\u2019s insecure and wants internet strangers to be puff up his fragile ego."]}
