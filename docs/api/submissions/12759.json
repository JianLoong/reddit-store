He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.\n\nWhenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\".\n\nMy wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1679324186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wkxwo/aita_for_wanting_my_pregnant_wife_to_see_a_less/", "score": 2573, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You saying she's \"emotional and irrational\" for having this boundary makes me think her doctor thinks poorly of you for a reason.", "YTA, for calling your wife 'emotional and irrational' and for 'insisting' that she change her doctor. It sounds as though your wife appreciates how respectful he is towards her, compared to you. \n\nWe have a vet whose blunt manner I don't care for, but he's a very experienced and skilled vet. So I keep going to him for my dog's wellbeing.\n\nRightly or wrongly, you might not care for this guy, but then you are not pregnant and requiring medical care. You need to butt out of this and let your wife - who sounds perfectly rational to me - decide who she goes to.", "YTA \n\nYour wife chooses the doctor, she\u2019s the pregnant one and her comfort outweighs yours.\n\nYou sound like the main issue is that he makes you feel insecure and that\u2019s a solid you problem.", "YTA Her opinion is the only one that matters. My mom had severe health issues. She has had doctors with poor bedside manners, but they are the reason she lived as long as she did.", "YTA - it sucks that he's kind of a jerk but so many bad things can happen in pregnancy and childbirth when a dr doesn't listen to the patient when something is wrong and this guy seems to respect your wife and have a good rapport with her, which can be very hard to find especially this late in a pregnancy", "YTA if your wife is comfortable with him, and likes him, that\u2019s all that matters. He is her OBGYN, not yours. And honestly sounds like you\u2019re the one with the problem.", "YTA. It's fine that you don't like the doctor, but I also feel like it's not really your choice to make. It's your wife who is pregnant, and I think she's absolutely right that finding another doctor is very stressful in the middle of a pregnancy. Good doctors are hard to find to begin with, so if she feels this doctor is good and trusts him, then it's wrong to pressure her to switch.\n\nI also feel like some of your reasoning for wanting to switch is a little weird. If he's not respectful to you, that's one thing. However, you made a point to note how physically fit and imposing he is.

First for calling your wife \"emotional\" when it's YOUR emotions causing the problem!!\n\nBeyond that, this is her doctor. Whatever you think of him, SHE is comfortable with his care. Her body is the one one the line, so it's her choice who she sees.\n\nAnd you are weirded out that he calls your wife by her name? She's his  *patient*.

Your wife likes him and he is encouraging and supporting in his interactions with her. I'm not sure what his physical presence has to do with anything, unless you're upset that he's taller than you. \n\nIt is vital that your wife feels comfortable with her medical team during pregnancy, as she is the one having to grow a human and push them out. You have very little say in this.", "YTA, when you\u2019re carrying the baby, you can choose what doctors to go to. Otherwise, she gets final say over her reproductive health period full stop.", "YTA  \nYour wife likes him and she is right, it's hard and stressful to change doctors during a pregnancy. If you don't like him, then stop attending the visits. You can just go on the important ones or just let her update you.", "YTA - your wife is right. It is very stressful switching OB/GYN mid pregnancy when she\u2019s happy with her current doctor. And being comfortable with and trusting her OB/GYN is critical during this time. Asking her to switch because of your own insecurities rather than incompetence seems ridiculous.\n\nIt\u2019s also disturbingly common for doctors to dumb down answers to an idiot level - especially for pregnancies. When my wife was pregnant, 90% of the  questions we asked was answered by \u201cdon\u2019t worry - that\u2019s normal\u201d rather than any sort of explanation. I think they think they\u2019re being reassuring to frightened parents to-be, but they really come across as condescending AHs.\n\nOf course, he turns that horrible act off when he\u2019s talking to another health practitioner since he knows she understands.\n\nAlso, as a nurse, your wife already knows MANY doctors are condescending pricks, so she likely has a far greater tolerance for that type of behavior.", "YTA. I\u2019ll be fair, though: you can choose the doctor when you\u2019re carrying the baby in you, and your wife would be the AH if she protested your choice.", "YTA \nI don\u2019t like the sound of the doctor either.

He is NOT YOUR DOCTOR.", "\u201cMy wife seems to really like him\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s everything right there. He\u2019s your wife\u2019s doctor, she likes him, that\u2019s it.

Just sit quietly during the appointment and get on with your day.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is the patient. You have ZERO say in who she chooses as her doctor.\n\nIf you are offended by how you are being treated, grow a pair and draw some boundaries. I'm not saying get aggro with your wife's doc. I'm saying calmly say \"ok, doc, no need to talk down to me\". Or, the wimpy way out: eye roll and \"whatever\" and turn to your wife to focus on her.\n\nIt's more than likely that doc isn't being threatening, but your insecurity makes you feel threatened. This is your issue to own. Not your wife's, not the doc's.", "YTA. You can choose the doctor when you\u2019re the one about to push a watermelon sized object out of your body with multiple people watching. Until then sit down and let your wife get the care she needs from a doctor she trusts.", "YTA. This is not about you. Pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum are some of the most vulnerable moments in a woman\u2019s life and she deserves to have the care team she feels most comfortable with.

It\u2019s basic biology", "YTA. I\u2019ll admit, the doctor does sound difficult and I understand your frustration, however pregnancy and childbirth are extremely stressful and what\u2019s most important is if your wife feels comfortable, not you.", "It's \"unfair\" you can't pick her OB? Grow up...you're green with envy. YTA.", "YTA. She is the one carrying the baby, not you.

I'm also wondering if he handed you two a book recommendation and you skipped reading it and the answers to all your questions have been in that book. There's plenty of books available on what to expect during pregnancy, heck theres podcasts, YouTube videos, and whole websites available. Also, Dr is there to address the concerns of the patient, and as long as the patient can speak for themselves the visitors are generally not going to get much time or attention.", "YTA. She is good with this doctor, she keeps the doctor. Quite frankly, with some of the stuff that happens during birth or C-section, you want a strong doctor. The pregnancy makes her irrational? No sir. Do you want a doctor that doesn't validate her experience? Or one that doesn't tell her she's doing well when she's doing well? \n\nI had one OB who was very stern and it was the worst appointment I ever had. Very glad I never had to see that guy again.", "YTA. She\u2019s the pregnant one, she gets to choose her doctor. No one else. \n\nI\u2019d also like to point out your complaint about the doctor being condescending to you\u2026that\u2019s how a lot of doctors are to their female patients all the time. You\u2019re getting a micro dose of what many women experience.", "YTA it\u2019s so hard for women to find a doctor they are comfortable with especially when it comes to reproductive health. If she\u2019s comfortable and feels he\u2019s doing a good job keeping her and the baby healthy she should NOT change doctors", "YWBTA. She needs to be comfortable with her OB/GYN. She likes him. She says it would be stressful to switch now. **Listen to her.** It isn't unfair to listen to her - you're not the one that has to get up on the table, in those stirrups - she is. \n\nNext time you go in, CARRY HER purse for her into that doctor's appointment, and make a point to let the doctor know you're carrying her purse to help her out. The two of you started out on the wrong foot, but YOU need to be the bigger person to make the relationship work (for your wife's sake), at least for however long until the baby arrives.", "It's hard to imagine being ok with someone putting my partner down, especially when we're about to be parenting together. I think it would be good to do some soul-searching. Your short narrative showed you not carrying things for her, evaluating her doctor solely based on how YOU feel about him and using that to try to get her to switch doctors. You might be an equal partner in this, but you're not making it sound like that. Has your wife tried before to tell you to think more about her and the baby?", "YTA. Pregnancy can be difficult and scary and your wife found a doctor that makes her comfortable. That is all that matters. It\u2019s not about you, has nothing to do with you, and you need to suck it up and support her while she creates your child(ren).", "YTA. Are you pregnant? No? Then what you  think has no bearing on her doctor of her choosing. Her being a medical professional, stay in your lane", "*\"...because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\"*\n\nI see why her doctor treats you the way he does. \n\nYTA.", "I was on your side in the beginning. I would be extremely aggravated if someone was to interject themselves into my relationship in an attempt to scold me for not carrying my wife\u2019s purse. Your entire description of him really does make him sound like a white knight in a lab coat. However you lost me at emotional and irrational. Some could say you\u2019re being emotional and irrational for wanting to change doctors simply because he makes you feel uncomfortable.", "NAH. \n\nListen, there is nothing wrong with you wanting to feel respected and spoken to in a manner that reflects that. \n\n*However*, pregnancy is something that is happening *to* your wife and it is happening adjacent to you. Your wife is the one who needs to feel like her medical care is in the right hands because she is the one carrying and ultimately delivering your child, she is not being irrational here. \n\nSo where do you go from here? I'm going be a jerk and say it, suck it up buttercup. Either have a one to one with the doctor and let him know that you don't feel like you're getting adequate information that *you* need because of his delivery, or you need to allow your wife the space to go to her appointments solo and fill you in as needed. Heck, she can even ask to record the appointment so that nothing gets lost in translation.", "YTA because it's her having the baby not you. What kind of questions are you asking that your wife couldn't answer? If she is a nurse, she should be fairly knowledgeable about what is happening to her.", "YTA. sure, the dr is being a bit of a dick to you, but is that compromising your wife\u2019s care at all? she seems happy with her level of care with this dr and that should be all that matters. she\u2019s well looked after and feels comfortable- that should be enough reason to keep him on her medical team. your emotions don\u2019t play into this.", "YTA.

If your wife is happy with the doctor, then the wife keeps the doctor.  Your insecurity is not the deciding factor.", "YTA your wife is right she\u2019s the patient so her wants matter and yours don\u2019t. Beyond that when I was pregnant my doctor left half way through and I didn\u2019t have a say. It was very stressful just being assigned a new doctor and having to get to know someone and trust them mid pregnancy. I couldn\u2019t imagine choosing to do that.", "YTA - you have to put your faith in your wife here. If you have a generally loving and support marriage, do you think your wife would allow someone to be rude or condescending to her husband? \n\nIf the above is true -  then either you are over analyzing or misinterpreting the dr behavior or you have given the dr a reason to act this way toward you. I would encourage you to explore which option it is.", "YTA\n\nThe fact that the first thing you mention about the doctor is that he is \"very tall and fit\" screams this is more about your insecurities than the doctor actually being rude. If you've made up your mind to not like the guy because he's more physically attractive than you, of course you are going to perceive everything he does as an intentional attack on you.\n\nDid you ever even tell him your first name? He knows your last name (assuming your wife took your last name)  from your wife's medical chart. And he clearly doesn't have to remember her first name as it's also written on the chart. It's not hard to imagine the difficulty of remembering a bunch of names as a doctor with many patients, especially in a field where there is a high likelihood your patient will be accompanied by a partner. \n\nIt's already hard enough finding a doctor who is taking new patients, let alone finding one you like and feel comfortable with.\n\nIf the doctor is capable/competent and providing good medical care for your wife and baby, WHY do you care how he makes you feel??? The important thing is the health and safety of your wife and baby...NOT your feelings.", "YTA. \n\nHER pregnancy and HER doctor and HER body are not about YOU.

He is a really imposing guy, both physically (very tall and fit) and in terms of personality. He has had a really hostile and condesendent attitude towards me since we first met for apparently no reason. The first time we were there, my wife was carrying a big purse and, as soon as we went inside, he started questioning me for not carrying it myself and let my pregnant wife do that effort. I was surprised by that and don't like confrontations so I just took the purse myself and apologise to my wife. The issue is that things have only gotten worse since then.\n\nWhenever he has to explain medical things to me, he talks in a really belittling way as if I was a little kid. He acts frustrated and derisive any time I ask something, making me feel like an idiot. He does not talk like that to my wife and she explains that it is because of her being a nurse and the doctor then knowing she is more knowledgeable than me with that kind of medical stuff. He also calls me by my last name but not in a respectful manner, just in a weird and cold way, while calling my wife \"Lily\".\n\nMy wife seems to really like him. He always gives her compliments about how she looks and congratulates her for being so great at everything related to the pregnancy. I told my wife I wanted us to leave him and go to a different doctor but she is refusing. She says that changing would be stressful to her and that she doesn't have any problem with him. She argues that how she feels should be the only thing that matters because she is the pregnant one but I think that is a little unfair. We have been in conflict about this and it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nAm I the Asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When it came time to give birth - he was awesome.  He was there for me, not my husband.  During labor a woman is very vulnerable- naked, in pain and literally pushing another human out a small hole, and you (by you, I mean your wife) has gotta trust who is at the end of the bed between your legs catching your baby.

Because labor and delivery is allllll about her and that baby.  Yes, this will be your baby, but this is her body, and this is all about her and the baby - their lives are on the line.  Until the child comes out - it is not about you.  I worked in a hospital for 13 years - work in a clinic now.  Usually, a doctor treats both parents to be the same unless there is a sense that maybe dad is not taking care of mom.  *There is a reason why he is treating you differently and it is not because Lily is emotional and irrational.*  His job is to ensure she is ok and that the baby is okay.  \n\nI had two easy births and then I had one horrendous birth.  I went into it thinking I would have a 3rd great birth and walk out of there with a baby.  Instead, I ended up in emergency surgery - due to hemorrhaging, after struggling to push a baby (apparently, she was a cork and once she was out- that cork was gone) out because I darn near bleed out.  My baby also needed to be taken by emergency transport to another city/hospital because she had heart defect that is the hardest to detect even with weekly scans - which I was because I was high risk.  Our bodies are built for birth but until recent history - lots of ladies such as myself died along with our babies because as natural as birth is - sometimes things go wrong during that birth.  Use to be that males were catered to and given input for female decisions - think house of dragon - but now - it is not about the men - it is the women are need the focus and it is the women who decide.  So, leave her be.  This is who she wants.  \n\nAnd ask yourself - what is the doctor picking up about you that is causing him to call you Mr. \\*\\*\\*\\*.  My husband was grateful when stuff went south that he got ignored when everything went from fine to not fine in a matter of a literal minute, because he watched me, and our child get immediate and lifesaving attention.  When you are in a situation where a code starts - and yes in the medical world codes are part of daily life, you have to push thru and then regroup and hope that everything you did helped.

Her comfort during pregnancy, labor, and birth must always come before his in terms of choosing a doctor to care for her. He isn\u2019t the one that is doing the heavy lifting here.

I'm speaking for my wife here, but I'm confident that if OP is a faithful narrator and this is really the treatment he is getting, and if I was treated this way, that would affect her feeling of comfort with the doctor for the aforementioned reasons when it comes to her most vulnerable moments. She would want to know that the doctor respected me on the same level, the way *our* doctors actually did, so that she felt comfortable that my opinions would be respected should she go unconscious or something. Like, if we already discussed what she would prefer in a situation and what to say if she can't respond, that my voice would be heard for her instead of them just doing whatever they want.

He is pretty no nonsense and will fully call out patients who are wasting his time, not listening etc. He is easily distracted and doesn\u2019t want to waste time because he runs a clinic and is the head of neurology at a hospital. He doesn\u2019t have time for nonsense. This can come across poorly when you first meet him. \n\nThe thing is though, he is brilliant!!! He was able to diagnose me and get me on the right treatments with multiple very rare degenerative neurological disorders. I had been sick for 12+ years and seen over 15 different neurologists who all dismissed me as crazy before I met him. He was able to help me in a couple months! He literally saved my life. \n\nNow that I have gotten to know him I understand why he acts the way he does and we have become quite close. The last time I was hospitalized he visited me every day, even when he wasn\u2019t doing rounds and stood up for me when the other doctors were not listening to me. My fianc\u00e9 even worked with him for a few years. I trust him more than any doctor I\u2019ve ever had! He is the reason I am alive and was able to get out of being a full time wheelchair user. Yeah he\u2019s a bit strange but he\u2019s a genius!", "And I get that. But is it so hard to be nice to the father to be? I realize it\u2019s not hip or cool to just be nice and respectful but the doctor should be filling OP in.", "OP also mentions that he compliments his wife on *how well she's handling her pregnancy*. The surname got to me a little. Living in the UK I took this to mean he's being addressed as Surname and not Mr Surname. That's definitely rude.", "Yes. The first \"complaint\" being that he's tall and fit made me scoff.", ">Yeah some doctors are jerks, but OP also reeks of insecurity and jealousy here\n\nExactly my point (though I really wish was just *some*, in my experience it's more like most). That's why I put that last bit in bold. OP 100% deserves his verdict here, just not based alone on the fact that he thought the Dr was mean.", ">OP is trying to ask his own questions and be involved and it's really not his place to be.\n\nThat's stupid, I'm sorry. Have you not been a spouse or sibling or parent or child of a patient before? You are part of the process and for good god damn reason. There may come a time when you are the only one that can speak up for that person. It is in everyone's interest to have thoughts/concerns of SOs addressed and done so with respect.", "The purse thing was unnecessary. And yeah, I'm going to go with OP being able to tell the difference in how the doc speaks to him vs his wife. It really shouldn't be different. Maybe he *is* insecure, but any doc/nurse/attendee (male or female) we've had over three kids has tried to build up the confidence of both parties. Not that hard to do!", "Exactly, he should be treated with respect. That's literally all I'm saying. I'm not defending him making a demand, but let's be honest that this doc kind of sucks even if he is good for the wife and she likes him. The husband is NOT an insignificant part of this process and deserves to be treated as such. Also, stop shouting, good lord can't anybody discuss without getting angry.", "\ud83e\udd23\n\nI think it shows his attitude towards her\n\nEx if I had grocery bags my friends would help me with them without being asked. We would just automatically spread them out between everyone in the group. \n\nOP also said that it was a big purse, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his wife was struggling with it/sitting down\u2026 etc etc. \n\nPlus OP is a bit dismissive of his wife by saying that she doesn\u2019t have to have the discussion due to her pregnancy/ hormones. But she\u2019s probably set on him keeping him as her doctor and doesn\u2019t want to keep having the same discussion over and over again.", "Despite many people's efforts, I see my child's father as equal to me as a parent.", "Usually if i don't see responses to the comments and the account being freshly new or with no history then i usually deem it as fake.", "Radiologists are mostly a little strange lol I used to work with a lot of them and it was very rare to find one that was personable. There\u2019s a reason they chose the one specialty that left them in a dark room without people.", "IF OP is a reliable narrator, the doctor should definitely be more civil. It\u2019s not too much to ask. Poor bedside manner can negatively affect care because it can make your patients less likely to confide in you. However, OP and his wife have no control over his actions: they aren\u2019t his boss or the medical board. Their only potential course of action is to switch doctors mid pregnancy, and I don\u2019t think OP should pressure his wife into that over the doctor\u2019s rudeness. It doesn\u2019t mean the doctor is right because he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just a matter of priorities, and the priority mid pregnancy is the pregnant woman\u2019s feelings about the doctor. \n\nI\u2019m not so sure OP is a reliable narrator though. Basically what it boils down to is: the doctor is a big fit man, he compliments OP\u2019s wife, he told OP to hold his wife\u2019s purse in what very well could have been a joke, and he calls OP by his surname. The surname thing: the doctor looks at the wife\u2019s chart before he walks in. That reminds him of her first name. It likely doesn\u2019t say OP\u2019s first name, so he uses the only name he can remember: their shared last name. None of that is a problem. The only problem is the way he condescendingly talks to OP, but given the way OP is blowing the rest of it out of proportion, I think he may be blowing that part out of proportion too.", "> it is even harder than an normal argument because the pregnancy makes her so emotional and irrational.\n\nThat could be why the doctor is giving a hard time to the husband.", "I have to wonder if the doctor just made a joke that didn\u2019t land because they didn\u2019t know each other. Something like, \u201cgeez man, you gonna let your pregnant wife carry that suitcase of a purse?\u201d\n\nWe also have to consider that everybody skews any description of a conflict to sound better in their favor, and as a friend of mine always says, \u201cthere\u2019s three sides to every story. Yours, theirs, and the truth.\u201d \n\nOf course this is speculative. But I have to wonder if the first impression being poor caused a snowball effect where everything he says was subsequently taken the wrong way. \n\nTo be fair there\u2019s a lot of info missing in the post to tell if the doctor actually has poor bedside manner or not. For example, is OP asking questions he googled because he\u2019s trying to sound smarter? If the doctor is explaining everything to him like he\u2019s 5 then I\u2019d think that sort of doctor would be patient with questions. Then again I\u2019ve met some doctors who were just really brash. \n\nI still think OP is TA because he\u2019s asking his wife to leave a doctor she feels safe with during a *major* medical event because he appears to feel emasculated by him. But the jury is out on whether the doc is really a jerk.", ">OP also said that it was a big purse\n\nSo? Is woman incapable of carrying a purse now? What's your point? The doctor made a huge assumption here that A) Wife needs husband to carry the bad or B) Husband didn't already offer. This stupid ass alpha-male crap that is probably more obvious to men than women. What he's doing is undermining the BF to elevate his own status. Same with unprofessional complements about her looks. Guys like this will knock you down no matter what you do. Hell he'd probably emasculate the guy if he did walk in with the purse. \n\n> so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if his wife was struggling with it/sitting down\u2026 etc etc\n\nMore stupid assumptions.", "Well he\u2019s particularly bad even for a radiologist, if that says something.", "Lucius is a top-tier name for a sploot-potato.  I approve.", "Why wasn't he allowed to come to the cervical checkups? \n\nI'm TERRIFIED of medical stuff and the only way I could see myself being comfortable with everything surrounding pregnancy would be if my partner could be present every step of the way.", "She\u2019s pregnant\u2026? How is that a stupid assumption?", "He was allowed 100%! We were both just a little awkward about those so he sat them out.

Y\u2019all honestly think she should switch from a doctor she trusts and is comfortable with to anyone who\u2019s capable because her insecure husband can\u2019t handle feeling disrespected? You seriously think his feelings are more important than her health? That\u2019s just laughable.", "That's not my stance at all, so I'll clarify. Switching docs may suck for her or may not be possible, for sure. What is important is that if she is relying the husband to speak for her and have her wishes respected, they should be confident that what the husband has to say for her will be respected when the time comes and not just disregarded while the  medical professionals do what *they* think is best. Sometimes docs make good decisions, sometimes they don't. While this doc absolutely respects his patient, he also sounds like the kind that would just ignore the husband if the wife goes unconscious. That's concerning to me.", "In your case, it sounds like your husband doesn't have a good reason, and I don't question you not caring in that case if he likes her or not.\n\nThe doc described in the post doesn't sound like a doc that would actually work with the husband as yours did, that's what I'm trying to say. He sounds like he would just disregard the husband in those circumstances, based on what I read. That should be at least a little concerning.", "There\u2019s absolutely nothing in the OP to suggest that the doctor would not listen to the husband should something happen. He\u2019s literally complaining that the doctor has more muscles than him.", "My husband doesn\u2019t think she is \u201cprofessional enough\u201d because she and I joke around. He was not happy that she wasn\u2019t totally stiff and had a personality that meshed with mine. Which is weird because if we just knew her, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d actually like her. But because she has a lighter demeanor, it\u2019s bad. Still, when it came down to trying to prevent me and the baby from dying, she was as straight and professional as possible. And it still didn\u2019t matter. He still doesn\u2019t like her.

He needs to defer to her preferences because this is not about him. It is about her. He needs to take a step back and stop centering himself in HER pregnancy.

She could also carry groceries and a ticket on her hip,  but again should she need to ask?  The correct answer is no,  and they usually don't ask because when they have asked before the answer they got was nope.", "The purse issue is flaky.  No one comments on the size of a woman\u2019s purse.  And to say Dr. McDreamy insulted OP and he apologized and took the purse is weird", "If his name is easily accessible then I would definitely be more inclined to believe that the doctor is doing it intentionally for some reason. I just wonder what the reason would be. Maybe the doctor just doesn't like OP either.\n\nI do think that particular issue could be solved by saying, \"Please call me John,\" the next time it happens. If the doctor continues, then that seems like pretty good evidence that the doctor is, in fact, a jerk. At that point, OP's wife may start to see it, too.", "Sounds to me like Dr needlessly called him out for not appearing overly helpful when that help was not required (its just a purse....).\n\nI think you're right about the emasculating thing. That appears to clearly be the way the OP interpreted this and other actions by the Dr.\n\nThe game thing is BS speculation.", "Of course what she wants matters. \n\nBut marriage is a team effort. The doctor is only there for as long as he gets paid. The husband is there forever. If you want to weaken your marriage by letting another person belittle your spouse, and telling your spouse to deal with it, then feel free. I guarantee it\u2019s a marriage that won\u2019t last, however.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. There are plenty of good doctors out there. This isn\u2019t the only obgyn and the wife is choosing to allow someone to belittle her husband because she likes this specific doctor. Sure, she\u2019ll get her way here. But her marriage will be worse off for it. That\u2019s the trade off of sticking with a doctor she likes who belittles her spouse.", "I did respond to what you said. You said OP is not the patient, so the doctor owes him no common courtesy. The doctor only has a responsibility to the patient and fetus, not OP. I disagree with that.\n\nPeople are assuming OP deserves to be treated with disrespect, but we really don't know if that's true.", "TBF this IS reddit and the name issue could just be the small detail. The apparent lack of respect and communication between OP and his Wife makes me expect a update in 3 years saying they divorced", "I agree it's a team effort, no doubt\u2014 something I can absolutely agree on 17 years in myself\u2014 but isn't it ultimately her decision the doctor she goes to see? If she doesn't feel belittled, why do you get to decide for her how she feels?", "Sure they\u2019re out there. Not necessarily within a reasonable driving distance- which is important as one\u2019s obgyn has to be close when you go into labor", "OP is argumentative, he is unsupportive, he said it's \"unfair\" that it matters the most how SHE feels. He may need to learn his supporting role, he's not accepting it yet.", "That's because you have a supportive husband.  It's possible that maybe the doctor doesn't see him that way.", "I can't imagine letting anyone passive aggressively prod me for months without doing something about it. A doctor insisting on calling you by your last name every time he sees me despite knowing my first is bizarre, I would at minimum have asked him what's up with that by now.", "Ok good! I imagine if I'm comfortable enough with someone to decide to have a baby with them, I'd be comfortable with them seeing me no matter what I look like haha", "Sure dude thanks for the laugh \ud83d\ude02", "He's been there for worse than a cervical check lol everyone's comfortable with different things at the doctor :)", "Lol what?", "Yeah, I think most of this sub turned on him the moment they read that comment if they hadn't already.", "Right like this isn\u2019t that selfish of a request anyways but he is also the father and deserves to have a good experience with this too, not be talked down on and made to feel like less", "At least, it seems OP thinks so~~m~~", "Yeah, I'm with you to a very large extent. Our cardiologist friend recommended a doctor for my gramma while having dinner with us (close family friends). He said he'd pull strings to get Gramma in to see him, since the guy's schedule was booked. He ALSO warned us \"the guy's an asshole. Like he's REALLY rude and condescending. He's a dick. But he's also a VERY GOOD doctor and that's who she needs right now. So I'll book the appointment. Just know he's an asshole.\" And he was right. The guy's an asshole. I really dislike him. Subsequent dinner we were discussing Dr.Dick, and why he'd become a doctor if he doesn't like people. Cardiologist buddy said his assessment of Dr. Dick was that he really doesn't like people, but he LOVES solving puzzles. And sick people are a puzzle - different signs and symptoms presenting as they do form a cryptogram to tell you what's wrong, and responses to treatment are clues about which treatment would be most effective for that particular person. Every cryptogram in medicine presents little bit different. So he hates people, but he loves solving their puzzles, and he's really good at it. \n\nI brought one of my puzzle books to the next appointment to do while waiting, and when we went in to see Dr. Dick, we very briefly discussed logic problems. He dismissively volunteered - without being asked - that he didn't have time to do puzzles anymore. I said i didn't either, but sitting in his waiting room gave me an opportunity. Turned out his favorite was logic problems. I ripped out a couple for him. He disliked me a little less afterwards. I still dislike him, but I get him a little better. Gramma lived to almost 103. That asshole solved most of her puzzles.", "How was he mistreated??", "There is forcing interventions on patients, this is common knowledge. There's also the well documented cases of allowing med students to perform procedures on unconscious patients without their consent.", "Reddit moment where putting down short men is okay but referring to a woman's weight is unspeakable. The double standards are incredible.", "Dumbest fucking comment I\u2019ve ever read lmao. He wants to be involved with his wife\u2019s pregnancy and it\u2019s a bad thing? Husband should be informed too", "Someone who is seriously intimidated by the doc looking better than him, so goes stalking him online.", "The...the comment above mine is, or mine?", "I mean she is his wife, just like he\u2019s HER husband. Y\u2019all just be saying shit sometimes", "I respect the system you and your husband have but this particular couple may not be in the same situation. \n\nAnd yes, I usually do give my phone/keys/wallet to my partner/friends. My friends also would sometimes get me to carry their purses if it gets too heavy (along with their phones/wallets etc etc)\u2026.. so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal to have personal items on someone else. \n\nI can see how that would come off the wrong way, but I also don\u2019t think it was grievous especially concerning the rest of the post.", "Above yours", "Phew! Been catching a lot of heat, rough going in this thread lol. I'm here for the drama though lol.", "That\u2019s the problem you\u2019re having here. She is more concerned with herself and her feelings than her husband who has been belittled and humiliated by another person. She is choosing another person first over her partner. She\u2019s certainly entitled to do what she wants, but it\u2019s a toxic choice she not a healthy one.", "I would have shot back to the doctor she could carry her own purse and she would have asked me if she needed me to carry it for her. And if he was calling me by my last name, I would start calling him Mr, Sport, Champ, basically anything that doesn't include the title \"Dr.\" I have worked as a contractor in the medical field and let me tell you, doctors can be some of the most condescending people who deserve to have their jaws wired shut. OP was punked out on that first visit.", "Can\u2019t wait to see him in fatherhood", "Yeah the sexism is really showing in this thread", "Pretty sure she's the one that's pregnant\u2014 unless I'm missing something. If he can't put his fragile ego aside for what's best for her, maybe he's no hero either.", "This is exactly what I was thinking! He's not used to having a doctor not make him the focus and that makes him see it through this lens. That's the vibe I got.", "PREGNANT WOMAN IS ALL THAT MATTERS, MEN DONT NEED EMOTION UNTIL PERMITTED. THEN ITS TOO LATE, WHY DONT YOU SHOW EMOTION. lol", "I can assure you that doctor\u2019s hospital or practice would not want him engaging in any sort of commentary on the physical attractiveness of a patient.", "Fragile ego? Do you even understand what\u2019s happening here? This is flagrant disrespect of her husband. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, she certainly can stick to her guns here, but no spouse with any self respect will stand for a partner who stands there and does nothing while they are being belittled, much less being told to \u201cdeal with it\u201d.", "To me his big ego is hiding major insecurities since the first thing he said is that he is tall and fit...why TF does that matter?", "There is no reason for your wife to change doctors, including your insecurity.* \n\nFIFY", "Plus all we know is that OP *feels* like he's being talked down to because the doctor uses simpler language than when he talks to OP's wife who is a nurse.\n\nI can't help thinking that OP's perception is being coloured by his jealousy of the \"tall and fit\" doctor who gets on really well with his wife.", "Had a similar situation with our ex-cat.  He wasn\u2019t drinking water, just putting his nose in it, and hiding under the bed, pretty obvious symptoms of kidney failure. Vet offered to keep him for observation.  I had to convince my husband that it was just going to prolong things or worse, he would die without us there which happened with his ex-dog and he regrets to this day. \n\nFortunately I was able to convince him, and now Ex-cat\u2019s ashes are on the mantle with ex-dog\u2019s.  Both lived to their mid to late teens.  Aiming for the second decade with the current cat.", "It also makes me wonder, when OP says the doctor talks down to him about the medical stuff. Does he actually talk down to him or does he break it down like you\u2019d explain to someone with little to no medical knowledge, and OP doesn\u2019t like it because wife doesn\u2019t need that more in depth explanation since she\u2019s a medical professional?", "I have 5 kids and have seen the same OB office for them all over the past 15 years. There's been one doctor that I ask to not see in rotation. He's just not nice at all, and always rushed. During one of my deliveries through he was the one on call and when I started hemorrhaging he was calling out instructions and orders to nurses like crazy, cool as a cucumber.\n\nI had twins in December and while I don't want to say I almost died, it was really bad.\n\nI saw my two favorite OBs from my office for the whole pregnancy, as well as a MFM team a couple hours away. Both teams completely dismissed all concerns I was having. For example I gained over 30 pound in just over 2 weeks, and I was so swollen I couldn't close my mouth. But they dismissed everything with a \"you got this mama, twin pregnancy is just hard\" and a smile, so I never pushed further. My bloodwork, physical symptoms and urine tests near the end started showing signs of the disorder I ended up with and no one caught it. I feel like if I'd been seeing the doctor I avoided, he would have caught it.\n\nNo more babies for me, but I wished I'd had the insight to go for the doctor that doesn't put comforting me above everything else.", "I dunno though, is it about his bedside manner, or has the doctor interacted with hundreds of selfish partners like OP? I don't work in the medical field, but I do work with the public and let me tell you, anyone being openly shit to their partner does not get the same treatment as everyone else. They get the bare minimum and contempt from me, and I will strictly address the partner only. When you deal with people everyday, your capacity for the shit ones fades fast.", "Probably has a lot to do with her full name being on her file (since she\u2019s the patient) and his not\u2026 since he\u2019s not the patient. That simple. The man sees multiple patients a day, highly doubt he\u2019s remembering the name of every spouse, etc that accompanies everyone in. I\u2019m addressed by my last name for all my child\u2019s visits, and she\u2019s addressed by her first\u2026 since she\u2019s the patient and they\u2019re looking at her file.", "I\u2019m with you. I think you\u2019re right", "I mean, I feel like half the posts here I suspect are fake are part of some humiliation kink, because I can't fathom that degree of a lack of self-awareness unless it's all part of their fantasy.\n\nSo maybe you're right...", "Links please", "Yeah, I was briefly thinking \"Well having her not carry her own bag is ridiculous\", but given the rest of OP's complaints and his tone, I'm now thinking it was either a joke or the wife was actually visibly struggling with it in some way and OP just completely failed to notice"]}
