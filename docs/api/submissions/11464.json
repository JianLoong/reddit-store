It\u2019s just basic respect. \n\nIf OP sees chocolate he thinks has been there for a month he could solve this problem by just *asking before he eats it* which is also just basic respect. \u201cHey honey, you still have this kitkat, do you mind if I eat it today and replace it tomorrow?\u201d\n\nThe issue here isn\u2019t the chocolate but the basic respect of not listening when his wife asks him not to keep taking her treats and not being willing to ask permission.", "[removed]", "I know! And it truly is delicious pizza. I felt so bad.", "Now go out and cultivate your *own* stash of chocolate!", ">I shouldn\u2019t have to hide my food (or any belonging) from him to keep him from taking/eating/ruining it. It\u2019s just basic respect.\n\nJust on this part. I agree that it's disrespectful to take your partner or roommate's personal food w/o asking. However, as someone with poor impulse control around chocolate, I would have a hard time if someone I lived with constantly left chocolate out that I wasn't supposed to eat. I would probably ask them to put it out of sight. If someone wants a private treat stash, I don't think it's unreasonable to ask them to keep it out of the way.\n\nedit: typo", "Bot.", "Spot on. I would eat that chocolate too, but I would feel bad and realize it\u2019s my impulse problem and would ask wife to hide it. It\u2019s odd that he keeps doing it and then blames the wife somehow."]}
