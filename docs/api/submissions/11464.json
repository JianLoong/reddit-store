When I got older, I got a job specifically so I could buy things for myself (shampoo that I liked, food, clothes). My sister and brother constantly took what I had paid for, and it was a major piss off. So when it comes to treats or \u2018my things\u2019 I can be very possessive.

I made it clear when my current relationship started this shit won't fly and we both immediately agreed it was stupid to have things in a family home and then not touch it but get mad someone else does so we put a time limit.
