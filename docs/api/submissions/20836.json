And that's nothing against the baby. Maybe - if possible add, that you will ask your boss if you can get a raise (some companies can be helpfull in this situation and if you wored for them for a long time, they might give it to you - especially if they would fear (don't treat that) that they could loose you, if you have to look for a better paying job). \n\nAfter you talked to your wife, also talk to your children. Tell them, that what you said was coming out wrong. That you were just afraid of the new situation or something like that.

Maybe you can give arguments that he will have a younger brother with whom he can play and play fight. A young boy who will always look up to him and where he can be the big rolle model.
