I love my job and am passionate about educating children. I have dedicated my life to teaching and have invested a lot of time and effort into becoming a professional educator. Recently, my sister-in-law (32F) approached me about homeschooling her son (6). She said that she doesn't trust \"the public school system\" and wants me to quit my job and homeschool her son instead.\n\nI was taken aback by her request and explained to her that I am a professional teacher, and that it is not appropriate for me to homeschool her child. Not only I don\u2019t have the proper credentials to homeschool a child, but also, I am not comfortable with the responsibility of teaching someone else's child full-time. I also reminded her that I have a job and a career that I am dedicated to, and that I am not willing to give up that for homeschooling her child.\n\nShe didn't take my response well and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since. She's also been complaining to my family about my decision, saying that I am being \"selfish\" and \"not thinking of others.\" She even went as far as accusing me of not caring about her son's education and not being a good uncle.\n\nI understand that she wants the best for her child and that she is concerned about the public school system, but I don't think it is fair or reasonable for her to expect me to give up my career and homeschool her child. I've tried to explain to her that there are many other options available for homeschooling and that she should explore them, like a private school, or hiring a certified homeschool teacher.\n\nI've even offered to help her with research or give her advice on how to choose a good curriculum and materials, but she doesn't seem to want to listen. I even had to talk to my brother (34M) about the situation and made clear that I will not homeschool her son.\n\nI feel like I'm in a difficult position here. I don't want to hurt my sister-in-law's feelings, but at the same time, I don't want to sacrifice my own career and goals for the sake of appeasing her. I also don\u2019t want to be accused of not caring about my nephew's education.

She wants you to do the all the work. She's not even open to other options.

If this is what she wants then it is up to her to provide it, not you.", "NTA. You honestly should just start saying that she is the \"selfish\" one and \"not thinking of others\" because that's actually what is happening.

It might be time to get that intermediary involved to shut this down now.", "You're not in a difficult position- that was an absurd request. NTA.

Unless your SIL is planning on paying your current salary including benefits and PTO, and allowing for merit increases, she's just blowing smoke.

Well, she's not being a good SIL either by asking you to give up your livelihood to educate her child. \n\nTell her to take her delusional entitlement elsewhere. \n\nNTA.", "NTA! Your SIL is being an entitled, arrogant (insert many bad words here)! How DARE SHE expect you to give up your life and career to teach her entitled child! That is absolutely beyond the pale!
