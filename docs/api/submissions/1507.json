Tonight while the power was still out my dad had dinner reservations with some friends at a nice restaurant, he left my brother, me, and my dog home alone. He left us a with a power bank and some battery powered string lights. He also said we could order dinner or eat food at the house. After he left I called my mom and she was annoyed that he left us by ourselves to hang out with his friends, and when my dad got home ( the power had come back on at that point) I told him what my mom said. He was mad at me for \u201cgetting him in trouble\u201d because we had everything we needed. And I feel a bit bad because technically we did, but I still think he shouldn\u2019t have left us.

You are old enough to spend a few hours at home alone while your dad goes out. You obviously have phones to entertain yourselves (otherwise you wouldn\u2019t be able to call and order dinner) and dad\u2019s presence at home isn\u2019t going to change the power situation. I don\u2019t see where the problem is except that you we\u2019re jealous that dad went out while you were home, something that\u2026 if it hasn\u2019t happened before, you should expect to happen as you both get older\u2026 you aren\u2019t 10yo anymore. \n\nYou should apologize to dad. There was no need to get your mother involved except to stir up drama between your divorced parents.", "NTA - even though you're both old enough to be home alone, it's still kinda shitty to leave your kids alone in a power outage. And more importantly, all you did was tell your mother what happened. There's nothing wrong with being honest", "NTA. I\u2019m assuming this is your weekend with him and you live with your mom? If I\u2019m correct, then I\u2019m pretty annoyed as a parent myself that he scheduled something on the night he\u2019s supposed to be you. He should be home with you guys, playing games, making sure you\u2019re fed and cuddling and telling ghost stories or something. Best of luck.", "I think you had a right to be annoyed, and to an extent even tell your mom what was going on. Your dad had reservations though, plans that were pre-made, and there were still resources to take care of yourselves. \n\nI think you're kinda TA, but I can see where you think your dad is too.", "Not seeing the problem. \n\nYour dad went out to dinner. You could order dinner. \n\nYour dad staying home wouldn't exactly make the power come back on, so what are you mad about?", "NAH \n\n\nWhy should he not have gone out with his friends? \n\nYou're old enough to bear the inconvenience of a few hours of having no power.    He said you could order in or make your own food.   (I assume you're competent to do that.)   \n\nWere you scared to be in the dark without him? (serious question.)   \n\nI know it's annoying to go through.   I spent three days alone without power due to fires in the area a few years ago.  But I'm an old person who isn't much bothered by such things due to a lifetime of experience.    I may have been upset in your shoes.   \n\nYour dad had reservations and it was a planned night out.    Do you often spend time alone at his house?   \n\nI won't say you are the asshole for being annoyed, but beyond that, calling mom and telling her was unnecessary.    I also don't think your dad was an AH for going through with his plans.    \n\nYour dad feels as if you tattled on him.   (Which is odd)   But I think you called your mom for moral support and needing to connect with her when you were feeling nervous.", "Not really but at the same time at 15 you can easily stay home without power for a bit", "It\u2019s 60/40, but I agree he is completely able to schedule things when we\u2019re not there.", "I wasn\u2019t necessarily scared of the dark, more stressed about what could happen; fires because of power surge,  running out of power in the 1 light we had, not knowing when the power was coming back on, our fish dying because their heater wasn\u2019t on. Most of what I was nervous about wasn\u2019t very likely though. No legitimate reason to be scared.", "Yes, it's the not knowing what might happen that will keep you from having a good time.   \n\nDuring a different fire event, our fish lived eleven days without filter running or food.    We had to leave in a hurry and could only take the dogs and the geckos.       \n\nThe way to be able to happily handle a situation like that is to know in advance what to do should something bad happen.     \n\nIf you know your neighbors at all, they could be a source of  help if you need it."]}
