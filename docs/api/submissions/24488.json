Every time you wake up to deal with the baby, wake him up.  Have him get out of bed, change the pamper and bring the baby to you for feeding.

I have a 9yo with moderate special needs and 8mo who's teething and in a sleep regression. I've not slept more than 3 hours at a time since my 3rd trimester with the baby. My husband also makes comments how he has no idea why I'm tired all the damn time and that I need to get it together and be on too of things. I also have EDS and some lovely comorbidities that accompany it. Hubby, on the other hand, has never pulled a night shift with the baby, because he can sleep through a tornado and usually gets at least 8 hours of solid sleep each night plus weekend naps during the day.", "NTA \n\nHe knows that you weren\u2019t picking a fight, he just feels stupid (rightfully so) for implying the lack of sleep is because you CANT, not because his CHILD is keeping you awake. \n\nHe\u2019s an asshole and I\u2019m wondering how long before you realize you could and possibly should just do this alone.", "NTA, your bf will not last a week taking care of the kids lmaoo", "NTA If you are extremely sleep deprived please take that seriously. Sleep deprivation can do some crazy shit to your head. For your own safety and your childrens, figure something out. Maybe pump milk if thats an option and he's on night duty for a bit, sleep in shifts, if baby is down or settled and doesn't need to be fed you are sleeping. Please get some sleep when you can.

The 20 month old still recognizes him as the primary care giver instead of me. I had a lot of complications with that one so I wasn\u2019t back on my feel for a several months. The others I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s hard to remember but maybe with the 1st one but definitely not the second one.", "This an actually wasn\u2019t a snipe. He genuinely thought he was making a helpful comment. It pissed me off because he completely dismissed the real reason I am tired which is obviously that I am up at night. It isn\u2019t that I CANT sleep and am restless, it\u2019s that I DONT sleep because I am up tending to a baby. While I graciously do this, it is important for him as a partner to at the very least recognize my effort and in this comment he ignored it.", "Please know you weren\u2019t \u201cpicking a fight\u201d, you\u2019re tired to the point of exhaustion and in constant pain, along with hormonal surges as your body is going through postpartum.

Make hubby handle diaper duty and night and then bring the baby to you for a feed. It is ridiculous that you are trying to manage all of this by yourself. What will happen if you crash and burn?

If there are things he could do to help you, make sure he knows it. Don't drop hints, be direct.\n\nI have actually had a friend (who wanted to be a boyfriend) tell me he didn't think I was serious about something because I said it in anger.

Or reduce your work hours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are doing that to yourself.", "NTA: breastfeeding burns 500-700 calories a day.
