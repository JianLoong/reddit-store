Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.\n\n\nShe'd barge in, then turns and says \"oh sorry\" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said \"so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!\". He seriously said that!.\n\n\nWe have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.\n\nSo I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she \"accidently\" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming \"she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom\". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel \"terrified/weirded out\" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.\n\n\nEdit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a \"me problem\" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd23 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

For example, when MIL sees you going to the bathroom, MIL can pick up the phone and call a friend who can support/distract her for the next 10-30 minutes until you vacate the washroom (say this with a big, fake sincere, shit-eating grin on your face).

I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she \"accidemtly\" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up (fully clothed of course).
