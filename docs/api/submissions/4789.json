That\u2019s totally your prerogative, and as a happily CF person (but very proud auntie) I understand if you\u2019re not into interacting with little kids during a game. It seems like that could have been a good time to talk her through what was happening with the game, teach her some basic rules or strategies, maybe make up some ridiculous cheers, basically just engage with her in person and help develop that initial spark of interest? Maybe something to consider for next time? I personally can\u2019t wait until my 6 yo niece gets to a stage where she might want to sit and develop a shared interest/ learn from her uncle and me about what\u2019s happening with a soccer match rather than just tell us about her plastic toys\u2026", "Not one of the other adults had a phone of their own to give her?", "NTA and your brother and his wife are bright, shiny examples of people that should not have kids (especially 3)", "NTA.  Your brother and SIL are acting entitled.  Why did they not make some plans for the entertainment of their own children?", "NTA but your nieces parents are\u2026 instead of berating you for making a choice about your own equipment you pay for they should focus on disciplining their children and teaching them how to behave. They could take parenting classes to help get tips on how to entertain children whilst out the home.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, your SIL and Bro were both extremely rude and had no right to question, dismiss and demand you do anything\u2026 this situation was a parenting issue. The fact some parents like to tell everyone else but their own children what to do and how and blames everyone else for their child\u2019s undesirable behaviour is crazy", "NTA. Your brother is and he\u2019s raising a future ah If she\u2019s not already one", "NTA. Where were the brother\u2019s and SIL\u2019s phones during all this?", "NTA, and people need to stop giving kids their phones for entertainment, especially if they're not watching them every second. They do not have to be trying for the internet to show them things they can't unsee.", "Nope, they gave their 2 phones to their second and third children. \n\nEchoing what other people are saying, wtf are some parents doing that they don't figure out ways to entertain their kids during long stretches of inactivity?? My parents always brought plenty of books (I was a book kid) and a few alternative activities, and if I couldn't get engaged, *they would interact with me* and I got valuable social enrichment and engagement with whatever activity we were all doing. \n\nLike I don't get this whole screen generation, although I understand the convenience, but if the parents don't bring equal level entertainment for all the kids (aka enough screens for each or better yet, a variety of non screen activities for each), their responsibility for bringing them into public is to like. take care of their kids lol. \n\n*Never* would my parents expect someone to give up their possessions or time to entertain me at a social gathering, they'd either do it themselves or have me stay with my cousins (paid and reciprocated) for a kid free evening.", "It's his phone and if using it to follow chats during the game gives him greater enjoyment then it's NOT 'pointless'.  Just because YOU might not be all that interested in doing it doesn't mean it's pointless, that is just a completely disrespectful attitude on your part.  And the kid already had the phone for 2 hours, what is it now her phone until she decides she's done with it??  What a great lesson to teach a kid, no wonder she ended up throwing a temper tantrum.", "How is any of that OP's fault?", "I loved Madlibs! You mentioning made me look on the App Store to see if there\u2019s an app for it, and there is! Thanks!", "NTA, your SIL and brother took their kids to a game in a cafe, which we can all imagine is not the best fun for them, unless they are really into that game. They should have brought stuff to entertain their own kids, you are not responsible for it.", "NTA- her parents should have had something to keep her busy. That was not your responsibility & who are they to tell you to give your property to anyone.", "NTA\n\nYour reasons for wanting to hang on to your phone don't matter. Its your phone and you don't have to let anyone borrow it.", "Jeeze. If she needs a phone so bad to keep her entertained. They can buy a spare. The entitlement of some people just astounds me. NTA", "NTA. The entitlement is strong with your brother and SIL.", "ESH for having those kids in a purely adult environment.  Get a fucking sitter.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to entertain his kids with your phone. They should have pre planned the outing. Too many parents EXPECT everyone to bow down to the whims of their kids. The ENTITLEMENT makes your brother and SIL the AHs.", "NTA, and the sweetest thing is your niece-whispering of pulling her in your lap and validating her feelings. Rather than pawninh her off on tech like her parents. You will go far, grasshopper.", "NTA. You\u2019d think parents of an 8 year old would know to be prepared for their children\u2019s needs by now. Don\u2019t they own any coloring books? Kids can be entertained by things besides screens. It was nice of you to let her use it when you weren\u2019t, and there is nothing wrong with you not agreeing to give it to her again.", "NTA.\n\nYour bro's kids are gonna grow up to be nightmares if they aren't already.", "You're NTA. Your brother is, though. You're not responsible for entertaining his child. Besides, kids thinking they must have an electronic device in their hands every waking moment is a terrible trend. But since that is how they're choosing to raise their kids, they should have had them take turns playing with their phones.", "NTA, but my biggest takeaway is how good you are with your niece. She told you she was mad at you, you still showed her support and offered her a space to process her feelings. I think her being quiet for the rest of the night shows that this was a good move and she may have used that time to think things through, as much as a kid can!", "Also seemed to leave the parenting to you too.. ie you\u2019re not entitled to other people\u2019s things and throwing a tantrum to get your way is not going to get rewarded.", "Nailed it. NTA.", "I dated a guy who had a 7yr old boy. I would let him play on my phone (downloaded kid-friendly apps for him) when we were driving on long trips or at boring (for a kid) places for extended periods. He always asked politely, gave it back when requested, and would hand it to me if I got a call or text. He could use his dad's phone, but mine was \"smarter\" and had cooler games. I would also let him take my e-reader if he asked. No earthly reason for him to be bored to tears when it cost nothing to provide entertainment.", "I\u2019m the same way lol. I\u2019ll go overboard on packing entertainment bc I know how I am and then most of the time I end up not touching any of it and just listening to an audiobook or playing a game on my phone lol. Been this way my whole life. I remember when my mom gave me my \u201cfirst purse\u201d (just a small purse she didn\u2019t want anymore and wasn\u2019t worth the trip to goodwill) when I was like 9 and the first thing I did was cram it so full of little toys and pencils and paper that it barely zipped to go to my siblings soccer game. \n\nThere\u2019s a local bar/brewery/beer garden place that\u2019s really great but I wish they would limit how late you can bring your kids with you cause people will just drink with their friends while their elementary age kids run around in the grass trying desperately to entertain themselves. One time these kids were playing tag and a littler one (maybe 4yo) literally crawled through the middle of our group, like between our legs. And I think that was after they converted to regular tag instead of pelting each other with the corn hole bean bags. I couldn\u2019t even really be mad at them, what are kids supposed to do at a bar?", "Sounds like your brother and SIL need to parent their own children.", "NTA my youngest is 12yo and until end of last year I still had a few things I kept in my large parent tote bag to pull out to entertain her in public for various reasons including a peppa pig mini figurine and a hot wheel car.", "NTA", "NTA. The kids should be expected to share, and her parents should have known to bring something to entertain the kids", "Dude. NTA at all. Why didn't your brother or SIL provide entertainment for their own daughter, instead of expecting you to do so? As a parent, it isn't hard to bring an activity bag and/or an iPad for your kids.", "NTA- it is not your job to provide entertainment to OPK (other people\u2019s kids).", "This.  While I agree with all the comments stating the children\u2019s parents should have made sure they would not be bored, their demands that OP give his niece his phone to shut her up we\u2019re over the top.  \n\nThey are teaching their daughter that is she is a big enough pest, she can get whatever she wants.  That\u2019s screwed up.  NTA.", "Yeah, when my parents took me to restaurants I always had an activity bag when I was little. Nothing huge: a small tote bag with a pack of crayons, a few coloring books, and a book that I was able to read by myself. Maybe a few plastic dinosaurs.\n\nBy the time I was like 7 or 8 the tote bag was just a couple of books (I loved reading).\n\nMy adult friends with kids make sure their own kids all have something similar, usually a Ipad or some kid's electronic device. Oh and head phones.\n\nAnd that was for the times when they did engage with me. They often talked to me at the dinner table, asked me questions about my day and friends, and what I thought about whatever movie we watched.\n\nFor all his faults, my bio-dad could patiently listen to a six year old talk all day and not get mad, bored, or frustrated. He saw playing with me and talking to me part of being a dad.", "Yup.   \n\n\nI was at a family wedding this year. My nephew's wife had a whole shopping bag of items to keep her three kids happy. (Included a bride and groom Ken and Barbie - good thinking, I thought.)  \n\n\nShe kept those kids occupied all day and all evening. I take my hat off to her. (Yes, my nephew also interacted with the kids, but it was his wife who planned the toys and distraction aids.)", "Exactly! I always had my drawing stuff on me, I often flew between states as an unattended minor after my mum moved but she always made sure I had my discman and extra batteries in the bag as well (oh the 90\u2019s!) I was always around adults so I learned how to behave and talk around adults just from them interacting with me rather than treating me like a coddled child. Kids are just little people, they\u2019re a lot more switched on and aware than some parents assume.", "We would do a big brunch at a really nice restaurant for my ex\u2019s parents and the whole extended family. Oodles of peoples. Lots of littles. Do we eat and go?  Hell no. We must socialize. And, apparently, I am the only one who thinks that children should not run around. They are cousins after all. Sigh. \n\nYear 2, I packed a massive bag of coloring stuff and small games. You want to play with Aunt Working\u2019s stuff, you sit and stay seated. This was before iPods and phones. \n\nMine are all old enough to download their own entertainment to their tech, but last plane trip, I had 4 batteries, multiple assorted charging cables, and an extension cord with multiple plugs in my bag. \n\nYou can take kids to such things and have it work, but you have to plan. And depending on an aunt to share her tech and drain her battery is not planning.", "Who exactly do you think is responsible for the children not being easy to manage?", "I bought some off Amazon a few years back for XMas and they were just as funny as I remembered them!"]}
