Who need to \u201cborrow\u201d that much food? The fact that she knocks nonstop and is rude to you is all the explanation we need. NTA.", "NTA, not your friend, not your problem, but make clear she isn't allowed a key. I have a feeling that will be their solution.", "NTA. Tell them that you\u2019re unavailable to answer the door and that she either needs to schedule her pickups or deal without what she needs to borrow.", "NTA. It's not your arrangement, so you don't bear any responsibility. If it were once in a while, I could see them being upset, but the frequency during the day while you're working is too much. I would make it clear that during working hours, you are unable to answer the door.", "NTA. If they have an arrangement it\u2019s for them to enforce it", "NTA.  Why should you interrupt your workday to open the door for her?  Even if you liked her, that's a lot to ask.  It's clear their plan isn't working.  The solution is another plan, not expecting you to be okay with being interrupted while at work.", "NTA and you need to make sure you express that as a solid boundary. \n\nIf they try to use the fact that you work from home, yes you WORK from home, which means you shouldn't be getting interrupted by personal stuff that isn't even your personal stuff in the first place. If she's knocking during work that can affect your productivity.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA. This is something your roommate needs to address. The constant interruption would be annoying to anyone.", "NTA\n\nEven if she wasn't being rude you have a right to not want to constantly have your day disturbed by her antics. Add to that the snide remarks and lack of appreciation and you have double the reason not to do so. Obviously, your flatmate and your neighbour think you're an AH but it's because you're no longer inconveniencing yourself and instead they have to change their habits.", "This is exactly like when solicitors call on ur phone. Don't answer if u don't want to! Just because someone shows up at all hours does NOT obligate u to respond to them. NTA and she needs to pre-arrange her visits - she sounds exhausting.", "NTA. She has become a nuisance and she is taking time away from your work. \n\nTell your flatmate to make arrangements that do not require your assistance, in writing. Tell the neighbor to stop the incessant knocking or you will start calling law enforcement, in  writing. Record one or two incidents where she creates the nuisance and you tell her to go away. \n\nThen start calling law enforcement.", "NTA. I don't answer the door unless I know who it is and have invited them. She definitely sounds annoying. Knocks 7-8 times per day to use YOUR kitchen? Your flatmate needs to have included you and everyone else who lives there in this arrangement.", "NTA. Knocking on someone\u2019s door 7-8x a day is completely uncalled for in any circumstance. They are \u2018sharing food and cooking equipment\u2019 \u2026 who cooks 7-8 meals a day? That seems excessive.\n\nTime to have a talk with your roommate. A lot of people don\u2019t realize that *working from home is working* - you aren\u2019t just at home hanging out. The constant interruptions are interfering with your livelihood.", "Not the asshole. Your roommate should even pay higher share of the rent for having an arrangement like that with that lady.", "NTA- you'd be hard pressed to find someone that will say you objectively being an AH here.\n\n>She and my flatmate think I'm AH for not answering\n\nI'm assuming you mean the flatmate that is already her friend because id wager the rest of your flatmates are annoyed as well.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fine not to let her in. And: If you react to her nonstop knocking with letting her in, you train her to do that MORE.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo NOT answering IS your best choice.  That way she will learn at some point that it does not work, and stop.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet noisecancelling headphones so you don't hear her.", "NTA\n\nUnless you moonlight as a butler for your flatmate, it's not your situation to deal with at all. You're working and the sharing food/cooking equipment is none of your concern. They need to work out arrangements between the both of them that don't involve your time.", "NTA.
