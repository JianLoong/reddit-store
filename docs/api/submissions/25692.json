Not the most glamourous or flattering truth but it's the truth all the same. When we found out we decided to keep the child and co-parent while remaining friends. We were never a couple and we didn't want to be one either.\n\nFour years ago he began to date his longterm girlfriend and they moved in together last year. She fell pregnant and i've been supportive to them both as much as I could be without crossing any lines; i've encouraged my daughter to help out whenever she's staying with them during the pregnancy and to behave, i've also made it clear that I want the children to have a close relationship despite having different Mothers, i've even said that if they were comfortable with it on nights I have my daughter if they ever want time alone i'll babysit once they have the baby so my daughter can spend time with her sibling.\n\nAll in all, I thought everything was great and I was excited for my daughter to have a sibling as she's always wanted one but I had no interest in having another child. Three days ago my friend and his girlfriend had a daughter, they asked me to bring my daughter to the hospital to meet her little sister yesterday alongside others of the family. So I did exactly that but when they introduced us to the baby I was shocked. They'd named used my daughters name. She didn't seem to have any issue with this when she introduced the baby bold as brass. My friend seemed uncomfortable and wouldn't look at me directly. I asked them what they were playing at, at which point my friends father said he'd take my daughter down to the cafeteria to get something to eat and left with her.\n\nMy friend told me to calm down and not overreact while his girlfriend told me she didn't see the issue and it was a pretty name. I asked them if they'd named the baby for my daughter trying to understand the logic here but his girlfriend said that no it was just a pretty name she liked. I then asked if they planned to use a nickname or a middle name when addressing to her on a daily basis and her response was that she didn't see a need for that.\n\nI told them they were being ridiculous and that they couldn't do this, I then told his girlfriend that I found this frankly creepy and told my friend he was being spineless if he was happy to go along with this. He tried to claim our daughter could use a nickname or something but I shut that down immediately asking why it was more reasonable for a girl who has used that name for a decade to shame her name compared to a baby who had no concept of what a name was yet.\n\nHis girlfriend told me I was being a bitch talking to her like that after she just gave birth and asked the nurses to remove me saying I was being disruptive.\n\nMaybe my temper is running a little too hot though and I was too harsh on her when she just gave birth. It's just so fucking weird.\n\nEdit: I'd also like to state, I know that what they want to name their child is their choice, they could have called her Dinosaur for all I care but this is one name that should be off limits or adjusted, they even have the same surname as they have the same father...Something about it just felt malicious and deliberate as if she's trying to replace my daughter and for them both to spring it on us like that at the first meeting? no that was weird.", "created_utc": 1693208797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/163fnv4/aita_for_calling_my_daughters_father_spineless/", "score": 559, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was embarrassed for a reason.

I suggest you look into changing your daughter's surname to your own surname (or at least suggest she can do it when she's old enough). So at least they won't have the same full name, and she can get some distance from her creepy father. NTA.", "NTA.  This is a calculated move on the part of the gf, and your daughter's dick of a father is too spineless to stand up to her.  While no name can be claimed, this is a move full of hate and spite.  I would tell your daughter's father that you will be going for full custody of your daughter and taking him for child support because you can no longer trust him to do the right thing by your daughter, how can you trust that he wouldn't allow his gf to treat your daughter poorly based on this behaviour.   Obviously his father agrees with you, that this name is not acceptable.  I'm sorry but your daughter is never going to get treated right by her father's gf, she is already trying to replace your daughter by giving her daughter the same name.", "NTA\n\nIt is ridiculous that your daughter's dad and his GF do something creepy and crazy. you may be right to assume the GF is probably jealous of your daughter and trying to replace her.\nNot healthy.\n\nIMO This was deliberate and not innocent even if they claim it to be\n\nEDIT: I am going to take a wild guess, that the GF had orchestrated the name reveal at the hospital intentionally to generate evidence and throw you out from hospital and from the Guy's life. \nShe knew her behaviour, warrants a scene and she crafted a get out of jail card even before committing the crime.", "NTA. Maybe not the time or place to blow up, but your friend letting his second daughter have the same name as his first is crazy. Is he trying to erase his \"mistake\" or something?", "NTA. This is ridiculous of them and will cause both girls issues with government paperwork for their whole lives going forward. They aren't doing the new baby any favors here.", "\"Please meet my daughters: Anna and Anna\"\n\"What cute sister you have Anna! What's her name? Also Anna?\"\n\"Anna and Anna, do you want a drink?\" \"In 20 years: Anna is coming over! Which one?\"\n\nThis is so, so weird. On the same level as men naming their sons prince 1, prince 2 etc. \n\nYou are nta, those people are bananas. I would talk to my daughter how she wants to proceed with visits, custody etc. And name the new baby Anna 2.0 or Also Anna in any conversations with your baby daddy. Just because it's factually true.", "NTA. That IS weird. Out of all the names in the world, they used the same name as your daughter have. So the father has 2 daughters with the same name. Im sorry this is so messed up", "NTA. \n\nHonestly, how did they THINK you would react to that? How did they imagine that conversation would go? If you want your peace and quiet after just giving birth, maybe don\u2019t spring that kind of disrespect and weirdness on people. \n\nOf all the names in the world, you do not choose the child\u2019s sisters name. It is weird and disrespectful towards the sister. Its a ton of pretty names. I\u2019m usually quite chill when it comes to \u00absharing names\u00bb i families or friend groups, but SIBLINGS cannot have the same name. \n\nThey should bin that idea, if for nothing else, that child\u2019s sake. I would be so embarrased growing up having the same name as my ten year older sister. I imagine people will be teasing her about it. I would always be feeling bad about it around family too, like I had stolen something that wasn\u2019t mine. And it would be hard having a normal relationship with my sister. The baby deserves her own name!", "NTA. Having two daughters with the same name and surname is messed up. It is definitely not accidental, there are thousands of pretty names out there.", "NTA. This is so weird. Why would the father agree to having two daughters with the same name. I would start making notes or recording interactions or something, sounds like she is going to continue to cause trouble", "Uff, straight up a do over baby. \n\nNTA \n\nDon't expect him to bother much with your daughter.", "NTA\n\nI'm usually a very big defender of that nobody owns a name and anyone can use names they like. But that is just straight up psychotic and all sorts of messed up.  \n\nAlso please make sure your daughter is fine, I can imagine this might be quite difficult for her", "NTA, that is a very strange thing to do, they are a weird couple. Just be cautious and stay away from as much as possible... SMH...", "NTA\nyou're right. There is something very malicious going on. Take good care of your daughter cause this can definitely harm her.", "NTA and I would make this a hill to die on. Usually I'm all for parents wanting to name their kid asparagus for all I care but this is petty and miserable for the gf who's obviously insecure. Withdraw your babysitting offer and try to limit the time she spends at her dads so that she's less confused about the naming sitch and also doesn't feel like her dad is replacing her.", "NTA. I\u2019d look at legally changing your daughter\u2019s surname to yours instead. Their behaviour is stunningly inappropriate, IMO. I\u2019d have been beyond pissed off if my ex and his wife had named either of their children the same as his and mine.", "So he has two daughters with the exact same name later? Absoultely not confusing whatsoever. How does he think this should work out? My country has very strict laws and I hope this also includes naming a child the same name as the other child. If your kid has a strong connection with her half sister later in life they will always be the two \\*insert name here\\* never seen as individuals when they are around each other. This will surely also lead to bureaucracy problems later in life with the two girls. I would always call them \\*insert name here\\*1 and \\*insert name here\\* 2 when you are talking with your ex about the kids that he will realize how stupid it is to name both of his daughters the same. He probably doesn't see it yet, but at the latest when baby \\*insert name here\\* know her name and will be called the name, there will be a lot of difficulties. I would already sit your daughter down and tell her that her stepmom used her name for the baby and you want to talk about it with her what she is thinking about it. Don't let her blinded by your opinion, just ask your daughter what she thinks about it. Talk with her openly about it, unfortunately there is nothing else that you can do than preparing your daughter for her future life with a baby sister with the same name.", "NTA.  It's passive-aggressive bullshit on the side of the girlfriend.", "It will hurt the baby more as she grows up- they couldn\u2019t be bothered to give her her own name so just recycled her sister\u2019s name?! That\u2019s who should be pitied in all this.", "Your \u201cfriend\u201d is no friend. He\u2019s not even much of a father if he\u2019s setting both girls up like this. \n\nAs others have suggested, change your daughter\u2019s surname to your own, and rescind your babysitting offer. Then get yourself a good lawyer and have as little to say to these people as necessary. \n\nMove in silence until you can say \u201ccheckmate\u201d.", "NTA.   \nThis is creepy.   \nGF is trying to create some serious wedges between co-parent\u2019s life with you, and her. And she\u2019s succeeding.   \nSadly your daughter is likely to pay for this with her relationship with her father.", "NTA, and I think that if your daughter has her fathers last name you should change it immediately to avoid identity theft issues that might arise later.", "NTA,\n\nthat is just messed up", "NTA. It's weird and i also find it malicious. \n\nAlso, wouldn't this create legal issues in the future? Say your friend passes away, how does the law diferenciarte between Daughter 1 and Daughter 2? I can also see this being an issue with passports, land deeds, etc.", "Absolutely NTA. You need to now cut back, stop being all supportive etc. Stop offering to babysit, your daughter now needs somewhere totally hers, where she can go and vent and spend time away from her dad and his do-over baby.", "Wow that is super weird. Never heard anything like it. They\u2019re setting their kid up to be a cheap knock off \ud83d\ude02", "Please send this thread to your friend. He needs to know what his gf is playing at having a child with the exact same first and last name.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Out of all the names in world they had to name her exactly the same as your daughter. Two sisters, with the exact same name. That's fucked up.", "I was so ready to rip into you because a name is a personal choice blah blah blah, but you are absolutely right to do this  - it's unbelievably creepy and NTA for you", "What the hell. \nMaybe talk to the grandparents? And him?\nMaybe it\u2019s time to talk about the co parent thing.\n\nHe is hurting his older child. And he has to see that.", "Nta. I suggest you change your daughters last name so it matches your last name.

There is no way this thread isn't going to be a unanimous landslide NTA and your \"friend\" is a spinless asshole who is going to drive his daughter away and give the newborn a bag of issues too.  100% send him this thread, maybe internet strangers will make him see sense.

NTA", "NTA\n\nWhat they have done is just down right rude and disrespectful to your daughter.  If they were just friends of yours then fair enough but to name their child the same as her sister is just plain weird.", "NTA, that is so weird. I would assume that their friends, family, just anyone at all who knows your daughter will also find it bizarre. No clue why they would want to make themselves look that crazy. Even if trying to replace her, everyone will think they're bonkers.", "NTA", "NTA. She knows exactly what she's doing here, and you're right - your daughter's dad should've put a stop to it. Seems like now that she has her own child, there's no room for yours anymore.", "NTA I\u2018m sorry to tell you but the friends new GF wants you out of their lives. This will only get worse from here on. Make sure to protect your daughter as good as possible.", "NTA\n\nDo you have any legal recourse? It could very well be illegal (in my country it is).", "\n\nDoes she think she's George Foreman?\n\n\nNTA", "In my country you cannot name two siblings with the same name (I think you can just if one is dead but I\u2019m not sure about it). Where do you live?", "NTA\nDont be surprised that your friend won't see your daughter as often anymore. I am pretty sure this inescure af gf will work on that..", "Yikes this is really weird. NTA", "NTA. Giving siblings the same first and last name is so weird. Your daughter\u2019s father has failed her because a good parent would have been trying to make the transition to having a sibling and sharing his attention easier not saying she also has to share her name!
