I had stated from the start that I would strongly prefer if my aunt didn't attend. She has severe developmental delays (she's about the age of a 5 year old inside), gets overwhelmed easily and generally doesn't enjoy crowds. She didn't attend my parents wedding either.. I feel strongly that my wedding will not be a fun time for her, as there will be a lot going on and there won't be any food She enjoys (she likes hot dogs and pepperoni pizza- the food at the wedding is all going to be vegetarian).\n\nI offered to do our own party with her and get all the food she likes, I said she could come to bridal shower if she wanted, the rehearsal dinner, brunch after etc. I feel like those events would still be a lot for her but they're much shorter events. All of these options were rejected. Instead they want her to attend the wedding- with two people they're going to hire to watch her. I said if she needs two people to watch her is this something she's even going to have fun with? They also did not offer to cover the extra people I didn't budget for (my partner and I are paying 100 percent of wedding costs).\n\nWhen I entertained the idea, I asked what the plan would be because my grandmother(86) and my mother (57) both felt she was incapable of staying the entire event. I got multiple responses to the same question \"she will come for the ceremony and leave\" \"she will come for just dinner\" \"she will come for the ceremony and dinner\" \"she will get her hair done with you (??)\". I tried explaining that coming in the middle of the event (likely during speeches or the first dance) was not okay and I expressed concern that there wouldn't be almost any food She would enjoy (food is a huge factor for keeping her chill)  and she would have to sit around for 2 hours before anything was served that she would enjoy. Knowing her that would make her anxious and uncomfortable. My grandmother yelled at me that she could have cheese and crackers. I tried telling them there's no cheese and crackers on the menu.\n\nWith all of the above I made the hard decision to just say \"no\".  Since then my mother has called my partner and his mother to try and convince them that we needed to let her come. When this didn't work, they started saying that my partner had told my aunt she could come and how dare he lie to her (this didn't happen). My grandmother then also proceeded to tell my future MIL that my partner was a huge jerk for lying. My mother has also accused me of making my grandmother ill over this. Now I'm being told my mother too is sick over this too.\n\nWell tldr my family minus my sister and another aunt think I'm a huge asshole. My grandmother declined my wedding invitation after attending my bridal shower and not acknowledging me.

I'm also sad for you that your grandmother is refusing your invitation, if she chooses not to go, it'll be on her.", "NTA, but your grandmother really is.\n\nIt's your wedding, and ultimately, you decide who gets to be there. You have very valid reasons for not inviting your aunt, and you're including your aunt in other wedding activities. Your mom and grandma both recognize that she couldn't even attend the entire wedding. From what you've written, I think you're NTA. I don't particularly understand why your family thinks you are...", "NTA did your grandma also reacted like this when your mother didn\u2019t invite your aunt to her wedding? Double standards, it seems.", "NTA I think it was really nice of you to do those other things with her so she could be included.", "NTA, \nYou are looking out for your aunt. If she's special needs and doesn't like crowds, then she's not going to like or even remember your wedding. I know it's hard to say no, but it seems like the others aren't looking out for your aunt but themselves. \nIt's your wedding, you do what you want at your wedding.\nShit my grandma recently passed, and my aunts decided not to tell my special needs aunt because she just wouldn't understand, and they didn't want to upset her. At first, I was like wtf but then my mom explained it to me and I totally understood", "NTA. Why is mom & grandma so bent out of shape about a wedding YOU are paying for when this aunt didn\u2019t even attend your own mothers wedding? Grandma should have disowned her daughter too if she wants everything fair. Ultimately it is YOUR day & the focus should be on you & your future husband, not what your aunt is doing/eating (which it will turn into if she comes. Mom & grandma will come to you with all the complaining when aunt isn\u2019t fed on time etc)", "NTA - Your wedding, not theirs. Your guests, not theirs. Grandma is trying to make a statement - how to make it backfire - tell her \"I'm so sorry you had to decline but since you decided not to come,  I can invite one of my friends I couldn't before\".

We love her so much so she's included!\"   Of course, someone ELSE is caring for Auntie so mom and grandma don't have to.

Sad that your grandmother can't look past her own wishes and see that this day isn't about her or your Aunt.", "Ughhh! This is so tricky. In my opinion you\u2019re NTA but I also get why your mom and grandmother are upset. I think they\u2019re being dramatic and overdoing it for sure though. They don\u2019t have to like it.

They are both toxic and do not need to be at your wedding.", "Right or wrong you are not going to win this one. \n\nFine. Let her come. \n\nGive your mother and grandmother the bill for the two extra people.  Payable in advance. No payment, no meal will be made available to them. \n\nProvide mother and grandmother with the menu and advise them that if they have special requests, they will have to pay it to the caterer in advance. \n\nEnsure that mother and grandmother are seated at the same table as aunt and her two helpers and make sure they are front and center so that they can deal with any outbursts and you can look on with empathy of how you knew this would be too much for aunt (and it will be, this is most likely not going to be a pleasant experience for aunt).

It's your wedding, you can invite, not invite, and uninvite anyone you choose. \n\nThis is like weddings that are childfree, yes people that have children do get butt hurt sometimes, but there are valid reasons for childfree weddings. Sometimes very distant cousins that you never see don't get invited, because of the amount of people invited is already pushing the budget.You can't make all the guests, and everyone you know happy. It sounds like your Aunt, wouldn't enjoy this anyway.

This is your wedding, you and your fiance are paying for it, and your mother gets zero say in who you invite.

While you have the right to decide who to invite to your wedding, excluding one of your aunts because of a developmental disability makes you an AH in my book.\n\nHer carers can decide what she will be able to handle, I imagine they know her better than you.

Why should someone not be invited because of their disability. She might be fine and have a great time. And if she's not fine then there are two carers there to assist and take her elsewhere.

Reserve a seat near an exit for the ceremony and main event and make sure there's a quiet space to retreat to somewhere if necessary.

I just want everyone to have fun.", "Apparently it was ok for OPs mom to leave her out\u2026and I assume it\u2019s her sister.

Thank you for your insight!", "Why not do all this, but with kindness! Clearly your family feel she should be there. Seat them near an exit so there is minimal disruption. Say you would appreciate the extra help with funding so that you can ensure everybody's needs are catered to. And let them deal with it so everyone can enjoy the event. Instead of falling out with your family who know your aunt as well and feel she will be able to cope. And stop thinking of only yourself. You are turning your wedding into something people will remember you by for excluding your disabled aunt.

I'm personally not worried about not being the center of attention. I'm marrying someone who already has a child and I want his son to be the center lol. I'm just worried she won't have a good time and the people in charge of planning her time at the event won't listen to me when I try to explain how the day is planned.", "Thank you for your insight. I don't think anyone else will bail tbh other than my mom and my grandmother. I'd just be sad that's what they picked to do instead of support me.", "To be honest with you the only thing I've heard is she didn't like the menu of food being served. \n\nIf I gave her the option of the wedding with my menu of food or offered her a different day with all her favorite foods, just less people I know she'd pick the one where it's more about what she likes.

It's a quirk of the sub. \n\nFWIW, I agree with you.  I can't imagine not inviting my disabled family members to my wedding, for any reason.  Especially since a clearly adequate solution (2 carers) has been offered.", "She gave multiple different alternatives they didn't like any of them, so they can fuck off", "How is this so low down! Unclassy and in very poor taste. If you're aunt was your own child being told they weren't allowed to come to family weddings you would be devastated.", "This is an equity vs equality thing. Your position is that she should be treated as similarly as possible to everyone else in the family (equality), but you're not taking into account the impact this has on her. It sounds like the wedding would very much not be a pleasant experience for the aunt, regardless of the accommodations made for her. When you host an event, the goal should be that your guests enjoy themselves. An enjoyable celebration looks very different for the aunt than it does for the other guests. OP's proposed solution is that they find a way to celebrate the marriage with her in a way she would actually enjoy", "She did give the opportunity to be treated as such and they said no. If the caregivers can't even give her the chance to come to the bridal shower she shouldn't be able to come to the wedding", "So op should spend extra money and have 3 people be dedicated to one person who might not even enjoy the event? \n\nSometimes people need to accept that those who are disabled are not capable of doing everything that others can.", "I think your mom has been made to feel guilty all her life since she didn\u2019t invite her sister.

And ultimately everyone wants a lovely day without any drama and fuss on their wedding day. \nI\u2019m sorry your grandma won\u2019t attend but that\u2019s a choice she is making. Do something special with your Aunt as a couple. \nIf you could possibly do hair and make up with her and then Maybe have her included in after ceremony pictures ?

In your post, you made it clear that you're pretty darn sure your Aunt wouldn't enjoy herself, so either way you aren't TA for not inviting her. So with that knowledge don't sweat what others say and think. Do what makes you happy, and have a great wedding.", "We had five year olds at our wedding. Now that doesn't mean OP has to. It's her wedding not mine. But 5 year olds definitely can enjoy a wedding.", "Karma bus will be coming for OP.", "Yup agree with this comment. AITA definitely is full of people who don't like to be inconvenienced by people with disabilities!", "All the alternatives involved excluding a special needs person. I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m just not ok with that. They also offered to have chaperones for the aunt. The people here who think this is ok are terrible humans who I hope I never encounter in real life", "Yeah like I get having the right to choose your own guests, but excluding someone for being special needs is low. Maybe she gets a bit loud even, but I\u2019m sure the other guests would understand and she can be taken to a different area by the carers. Drunk people at weddings cause trouble all the time. This poor woman already has a hard enough time as it is and then to be rejected by her own family?", "No it's just excluding her aunt. You can't predict for sure if she will enjoy it or not. Maybe not even her aunt can be sure if she will enjoy it or not. But if you consider someone to not be part of your family because they have a disability that may or may not impact their enjoyment of the day then that's a very sad position to take.

It isn't as simple as \"not liking crowds\". Give people a chance you don't know how they will react. Especially surrounded by their loved ones. Maybe it's a disaster and they spend all the time in a side room with carers. You can feel good that you gave them the opportunity to try and were not ableist and making assumptions for them. If you told your son one time you didn't enjoy parties, would he not invite you to his wedding?", "I was quoting what my mother said. Thanks for your input though.", "I can't order anything cheaper.

This isn't a \"might not enjoy it\" situation. This is a \"She absolutely won't enjoy it, but we'll see how big the meltdown is,\" situation, and the fact that grandma hired *two* carers (something OP is expressing surprise at) implies that grandma knows that too and suspects the meltdown will be massive. You say that the aunt deserves to celebrate alongside the rest of the family, but you're ignoring that the aunt *doesn't like crowds* so \"celebrating alongside everyone else\" is an inherently negative experience. The aunt (who doesn't really have the ability to advocate for herself) deserves not to be forced into uncomfortable situations because people feel like she should be", "So you think the blind should be allowed to go hunting or drive a car? Because that is what you sound like. \n\nOp stated that her Aunt does not like large groups. Op stated that there will be no food that her Aunt likes at the wedding.

You don\u2019t seem concerned at all about the poor aunt as you continue to harangue your point. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a case of someone being embarrassed or trying to \u201ckeep a certain aesthetic\u201d at a wedding. This is someone who clearly loves and spends time with her aunt and is willing to create opportunities conducive to an environment her aunt would enjoy to ensure she\u2019s included. The grandmother and mother have robbed her of those opportunities because they simply want \u201ctheir way\u201d which makes it pretty clear they aren\u2019t thinking about the aunt or her preferences AT ALL!", "So giving somebody an opportunity should come at the cost of someone else's event? Because when the aunt freaks out everyone's going to remember that and it's going to leave a damper on the wedding. That's just a fact. You want this woman to spend thousands of dollars on her wedding and take a risk that it might be ruined when there is evidence that it would not be a good environment? \n\nIf you have so much experience and are such a bleeding heart why don't you offer to fly out to the wedding and take care of the aunt so that the bride can invite her and not have to worry and everything can go the way you want?  \n\noh yeah because that would require a lot more effort than trying to make somebody feel bad behind a keyboard.", "If my son freaked out at 90% of parties, spent his time upset and alone in a side room while I was having fun, then no i wouldn't force him to go to parties to make *myself feel better* about including him.  Op knows her aunt better than you or I.", "I'm saying. Your aunt will have two carers. So those things will be monitored. You will not need to have any input you will be busy enjoying your wedding.", "Don't be ridiculous get a takeaway pizza for them to have or a ready meal to heat up. The thing is you don't know she won't have fun. You might not even understand what having fun looks like for her. If she's distressed the carers will take her out.", "People forget, your guests ARE your wedding if you invite them. If they are miserable and complaining, you will feel it too. If they are all whispering about how horrible you are to exclude your aunt and disown your own family who were trying to do the right thing and not exclude her. Everyone will be looking at you thinking you are horrible. Not looking at you thinking how wonderful the night is and how happy they are for you.", "You're very welcome. Hope everything works out.", "I completely agree. As much as it makes me want to feel morally superior it kind of makes me depressed that when people are anonymous they are actually terrible humans.", "No, see, she's family so we'll put her in the background with two randos. It's important that she's here for the wedding. She's family, but let's pawn her off on the paid help so we don't have to deal with it.", "This is a win win. Grandma has hired carers to support aunt if she doesn't enjoy it and take her elsewhere. Aunt can use her own autonomy and right to choose if she is enjoying the event or would like to not be there. She has been given the opportunity to decide herself. OP is putting up barriers left right and centre to prevent aunt from having the option because she doesn't want her there. She's pretending it's for the benefit of the aunt, but it's not it's for the benefit of herself because she doesn't want the risk of a scene where the aunt has to be taken out.", "Hunting and driving are both DANGEROUS. That is why they are not allowed. It\u2019s not even nearly the same thing. No one is giving aunty a gun or a car at the wedding", "OP is definitely lying in this respect. There is no situation where staff would expect the same meals as guests. There is always a separate staff catering situation.", "\"They aren't willing to pay for anything other than the staff and transportation. They expect me to pay for the food (for 4 people. Her, 2 staff and a driver) which is over 1000.00 if you include food, drinks, coffee etc.\" \n\nYour post is incorrect, please read OPs comment. She's worried about having to pay for their meals!", "You said you had two children with special needs. You would be sad if they were not included in every occasion because they might have a meltdown. I hope your children have influences in their life who enable rather than disable them.", "You see, this comment is the truth loud and clear. OP is so desperate to have the picture perfect wedding. She's willing to cut out her own family without giving them the chance. I'm always willing to stand up for those with disabilities in any way who deserve better than to have to put up with people like you daily. Making their life harder, being rude and ableist and thinking that you are better than them. \n\nYou could be disabled tomorrow and who will stick up for your rights?", "There's a huge difference between force and option. Option to retreat to a side room and not enter is not force. That's a different situation. This sub really hates disabled people!", "Your comments are so wild.", "Thank you for your insight. I've known her my entire life and I do know what distressed looks like. I won't discuss what that looks like and I will just say it would be very unfair to allow her to get to that point.", "Not every venue allows outside food. Mine didn't, and neither did my contract with the catering company.", "That seems a little presumptuous. It also sounds like those who feel that way aren\u2019t going anyways.", "Yeah, it's really not about being better. It's about trying to educate so that people with disabilities are treated with the respect they deserve!", "Are you suggesting the bride should babysit her aunt during the wedding?\n\nEdit: Sorry, I thought you were the person I had been talking to. Yeah. The choice is a fun activity actually with OP or something unpleasant with random carers", "You are assuming that OPs aunt has the capacity to make such decisions. OP has stated she is severely developmentally delayed and has the capacity of a 5year old. She is literally incapable of doing what you suggest. You\u2019re completely ignoring the reality of the situation because of your own bias. OP knows this aunt, has her whole life. She knows what she likes and doesn\u2019t like, what will overwhelm her and what he triggers are and she\u2019s saying this so a situation that will overwhelm and distress her aunt. What you think is \u2018fair\u2019 Is irrelevant. Forcing the aunt into a position where she will be stressed and overwhelmed is not \u2018fair\u2019.", "If the aunt has a meltdown that will mess up the wedding, you're right that's not dangerous but that's a pretty important event that most people would like to go uninterrupted. \n\nBut whatever, I'm clearly not going to show logic to any of you guys. You care more about virtue signaling on the internet than actually seeing logic and reason. And that's fine, feel free to have a wedding and invite whoever you want. \n\nBut unless you are going to help this woman with her wedding you have no right to call her names for a difficult situation. You are just being classless and rude", "Why not? Are you saying Auntie can't have  a gun? She has second amendment rights, too!

I\u2019m a mother of two children with special needs and I ask in advance if they WANT to go and do not influence - they hear what food is there and that often results in an immediate no thank you due to food aversions. But beyond ableism, what about classism? Why should the carers seated at the same table with her receive a different caliber of meal? Your hypocrisy and blindness to anything but proving your perspective is \u201cright\u201d is giving you away.", "So she's being expected to Shell out another $1,000 for a group of people, where 3 of the 4 are strangers.  \n\nIf you're so willing to throw away $1,000 then Give me a $1,000 and I'll agree that you're right.", "They absolutely do. We\u2019ve had one family wedding where the menu was super limited and had a big band ensemble playing at the reception. They gave us the option and I wasn\u2019t relegating my daughter to another table or paid carers while I mingled, either.\n\nMy daughter was invited to be in the wedding party as a flower girl, my son rode in a wagon they offered on stand-by just in case (because as soon as he saw the people standing up and looking at the wedding party, he froze and covered his ears). When the reception first started, my daughter went to \u201csing\u201d with the cellist and then as food came out, I discretely left with my daughter who was taken out for pizza and then home. My husband stayed with my son who wanted to dance.\n\nYou might consider that OP is often one to comfort and spend time with her aunt at family get togethers. It is clear that Grandmother and Mom have no intention of being responsible for her, especially since they didn\u2019t allow Aunt to attend because they couldn\u2019t find someone else to care for her during the shower. If my daughter was at an event where my husband and/or I were and was seated with a babysitter or caretaker, but not right with us, she would be upset and feel left out the entire evening. It sounds like OP wanted to include her in events she could personally ensure her aunt was getting time and interaction with her.", "The Americans with disability acts are already sticking up for the rights of all disabled americans. That is why people with dyslexia and ADHD are allowed extra time on tests, that is why handicapped accessible bathrooms are required in all public places, that is why people with mental disabilities get the education that they need and the services they require.\n\nAnd those laws state that there must be reasonable accommodations. Those kids getting extra time on tests might have to finish the test in the principal's office on their lunch break or take their SATs at a different location. That is why not every single hotel room is designed for somebody with dwarfism or someone who is over 9 ft tall, because it is not possible to make everything accessible for everyone. \n\nAnd no, before you jump on it, it is not a perfect system but it is doing the best it can. \n\nAnd Guess what? Going to a wedding is not actually a right. No where does this woman say she is cutting this person off. She tried to make accommodations and the grandmother didn't agree.", "I dislike people who purposefully stress someone (disabled or not) out in order to look good.  Op has offered several wedding events that her aunt would like, and grandma refused.  Op wants to include her aunt in a way her aunt would *also* enjoy.", "My daughter, who has had to step out of events for this very reason, HATES transitioning to another location and consistently says, \u201cWhy did we even have to come here?!\u201d I know she doesn\u2019t like big events, lots of noise and the sound of people chewing drives her nuts. I will still always offer it and she consistently declines. My son is different and loves dancing and just tires out from overstimulation earlier than most of the rest. For this reason, we bring 2 cars so if one wants to leave that\u2019s an easy fix.\n\nBut we HAVE had weddings and larger events that my daughter consistently declines and have brought her to smaller pre-events (showers, wedding dress shopping, etc.) that she absolutely loves. The grandmother and mother above never gave Aunt the option to accept or decline those opportunities. Who is truly concerned about the Aunt\u2019s comfort and preferences in this case?!", "The catering company can provide staff meals at lower cost. It does not cost 1000 to feed four people.", "Seems unlikely if the bride doesn't have some close members of her family there people aren't going to talk about why. By the end of the night everyone will know about how she refused to let her disabled aunt come.", "A 5 year old child can make decisions. They are a human with autonomy and can be asked the question. It's not my own bias. It's actually your bias against people with disabilities.", "1000 on food for 4 people? No way, get them a pizza. Plus one of them is actually her own aunt and would be a guest.", "I think you actually agree with me and have completely and utterly missed the point of OPs post. \n\nLet the aunt decide. If she wants to come and if she wants to stay, she will have the support of carers and it is grandmas responsibility to keep her happy. What is your point here?\n\nOp decided she wouldn't allow her aunt to attend because she decided she wouldn't like it without asking her. But OP made it clear in her replies she actually just doesn't want her perfect day to potentially be disrupted in any way.

So instead of taking up her grandma's offer of carers she's angry at her grandma and disowning her.", "It's not about looking good. It's about giving everyone opportunities. This is because OP just doesn't want her there and is trying to find excuses to make herself feel better about the decision she made", "Your child had the choice to say \"I want to step out\" or \"I don't want to go\".

To enable her aunt to leave if needed. \n\nNoone has asked the aunt. OP has made it clear she is an inconvenience and does not want her to attend. The rest of her family are sticking up for her aunt and saying she should have the right to attend if she would like to.", "It absolutely can cost that much, and not every company offers staff meals.

Putting this woman in a situation where she will have a meltdown, then have to be locked away in a room away from the wedding (which you\u2019ve literally stated is what you believe should happen) is not the kindness you think it is. It\u2019s cruel to force her into that situation. \n\nYes, 5 year olds have *limited* decision making capacity, but also don\u2019t know their own limits at times so it\u2019s up to those who are responsible for their care to make a decision in their best interest. You seem to think that to be human means to have the ability to have autonomous will when that is very clearly not always the case with sever disability. I think you live in a world of delusion. Time to come back to reality.", "Op said it would cost 1000 for the aunt plus the 3 care givers. \n\nAnd fyi - Many venues that host weddings do not actually allow outside food or drink that does not come from the specific list of caterers they work with without it costing an insane amount of money.

They\u2019re \u201cboring, slow and why do we have to just sit here?!\u201d Also, when any of my children were 5-6yrs of age, there were plenty of things that they WANTED to do\u2026 ride or drive a motorcycle, jump off the back of a couch to see if they could land on a pillow on a hard floor, etc. but couldn\u2019t appreciate the potential consequence so I redirected them or just plain said no. I don\u2019t agree with ableism and I do agree in giving people opportunities and creating the same. \n\nHowever, when dealing with a disability that limits the capacity to comprehend the risks or anticipate that something will be overstimulating at the cost of other people, I agree with finding a way (example we have paid the $25 streaming fee to watch the latest kids movie at home vs a theater so my daughter sees the movie, but she\u2019s not being shushed by others for calling out when she recognizes a favorite character) to allow her to experience something in a venue that\u2019s more ideal for her and won\u2019t also impede others\u2019 ability to enjoy the night they also paid to enjoy.", "The difference is, a weekend or new carer may not know her triggers or what her body language looks like as she\u2019s starting to stim or become agitated in order to de escalate and keep her from losing it. I know those things about my daughter and I don\u2019t yell at or around her (or at family members for that matter!) or escalate her in any way. And I can quickly pick her up in a hug (10yo) and get her out of a room if she escalated anyway.\n\nCarers are typically barred from physical contact unless there is imminent danger to their client or someone in the immediate vicinity. And a grown woman presents a challenge to get out of a crowded room discretely. I also know from experience that when my daughter has lost it in front of people, she feels INCREDIBLY ashamed and sad afterwards. So no, I do not agree that it\u2019s worth her aunt being put in a situation that is anathema to her comfort or enjoyment and \u201choping it just goes ok\u201d so her sister and mother can sit across the room and pat themselves on the back for ensuring she was invited even as two non-family members hustle her out of the venue.", "No darling the catering staff, photographer, videographer, makeup, cleaners, band, dj etc are not sitting down to \u00a3250 worth of meals each.
