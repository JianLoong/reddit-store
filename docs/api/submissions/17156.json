Yes, kids should help out at a family business WITH PAY, but it really sounds over-the-top.\n\nHowever, your response was pretty over-the-top, too.

I can admit that my oldest had a come to Jesus meeting with us, (lol) and laid out everything that she is being made responsible for. After she explained how stretched thin she was, I felt horrible. We made big changes. Like you, she also felt guilty. She felt like she was making it harder on everybody by needing to cut things out. We assured her that was not her role to feel guilty about. She is our daughter. Not an employee or child care provider, or errand runner. We just hadn't realized how much we requested of her. It is our job as parents to listen to our kids and sometimes realize we have put a lot of responsibilities on them. You sound like my daughter. As the oldest you have always taken on the role of care taker, and it's just in your nature.

Do not feel guilty for stepping back. This will also help your siblings in the future. After our daughter came to us with issues, it made us more aware as the other kids got older.
