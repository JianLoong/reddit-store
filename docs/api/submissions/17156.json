I used to work 5-6 days a week, but after negotiating more breaks I now work 4. I would come back from sports practice on weekdays and work from ~4:00-8:30. On weekends, I would come at ~12:30 and leave at 9-10. I feel like my entire life is controlled by this. I would have to negotiate breaks with my siblings to accommodate my sporting events, rarely hang out with friends, and stay up late to study. \n\nYesterday, I got into an argument with my parents over something, and it escalated into me saying that being their child was \nexhausting. They were hurt and shocked, but I continued to rant about how having to work there all the time affects me in so many different ways. I can\u2019t focus when I have to study, I can\u2019t get another job where I would make at least minimum wage, I can\u2019t do regular teenage things without having to jump through a million hoops. They argued that since I am a member of this family, I also have to alleviate some of the burden.\n\nFour seasons worth of sports and they maybe came to a total of 2-3 games. Orchestra and choir concert seats were always empty. Only one parent comes to graduations. Never have been on a family vacation. School vacations are always spent working. \n\nMy parents are working hard to support this family, I know that. I feel incredibly lucky to be able to afford to buy things that I want, have food and shelter, and be in a stable household. However, in many ways I felt like my parents were missing in my life. \n\nAll of that pent up emotion boiled over and I blurted out something that I knew would hurt them. It was wrong of me to do. I wanted them to know that I was hurting and angry too. \n\nMy parents still think that there\u2019s nothing wrong with helping out but I just want an escape. Currently, everyone in my family thinks I\u2019m in the wrong and I\u2019m being given the silent treatment.\n\nedit: i appreciate all of the support but unfortunately i\u2019m not financially independent enough to leave, or have any means to. i am obligated to come to work and can\u2019t escape that either, plus i don\u2019t want to have my siblings work extra because of me. i don\u2019t think my parents are as horrible as some of you guys think they are, they\u2019re just trying to provide for this family. it\u2019s a tough situation regardless because at least i can live in a financially stable home.", "created_utc": 1684003062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gp6tv/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_im_tired_of/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m a parent. There\u2019s helping out and there\u2019s what you have been doing. Two entirely different things. I actually believe the hours you worked when you were younger had to be against child labor laws. They chose to have children, not employees. It\u2019s too much. You are absolutely right.", "Are you being paid?  If not, there\u2019s a word for someone forced to work, for free.\n\nYou said you negotiate with your siblings over work hours - is the place staffed only with their children?  Do any of you get to say \u2018no\u2019?\n\nYou are not wrong, your childhood is being stolen from you.  It sounds like your parents and sibs are angry you are rebelling, meaning more work for them, - but if you don\u2019t stand up for your self, who will?  If you want to dictate your own life, then do it.  There will be repercussions, as there always are with any decision, so think through what you think will happen and deal with it.\n\nI think your parents have become far too comfortable with the way things are, telling themselves you all LOVE \u2019working\u2019 there (it ain\u2019t a job if your not being officially compensated, and the government doesn\u2019t know) and what a big, happy family you all are.  They will expect it to continue.\n\nIf you hate it, then stop.  You are less an 2 years from adulthood - time to start taking control of your own life.  Good luck.", "NTA. You are sixteen. You've been working for and with them for *five years*, while going to school and doing extracurricular activities. They are working hard, yes, but they did not let you be a child. You are being overworked but for them, it's fine because you are \"family\".\n\nI'm so sorry. Best case scenario, you move away for college and never return. Or you can find a job now, but the mental tow would be too much for you, they would never let you do this without a fight.", "NTA. They are taking advantage of you in the name of you helping out the family. What you are describing is way too much. It sounds like they had children just because they could not afford actual employees.", "who pays for your sports, orchestra n choir? How many siblings do you have? How rich do you think your family is?\n\nEdit: NTA my assumption about OP being from poor family was quite off", "NTA\n\nYou're being financially exploited.", "NTA.  If their business is not sustainable without forced free labor, then they don't need to be in business for themselves.  Period.  They will expect you to put your entire life on hold/twist it to fit **THEIR** needs forever.  College?  ***If*** they let you go you will have to tailor your schedule to still help at the restaurant.   Moving away for a different career?  They will curse and blame you.  \n\nI know it sucks, but hold on to your boundaries, and grow that shiny steel spine.  You are doing amazing things, especially with this workload.  You don't have to live like this forever.", "NTA. You are a teen and should be expected to act like a teenager. It is their business, not yours. \n\nOn top of that, they aren\u2019t paying you, they\u2019re exploiting you. \n\nThis is why people go no contact with their parents at an early age.", "this is why i get sad if i think about bobs burgers too hard. NTA", "This isn't the 1850s. How are they going to keep their business going when you guys get sick of them and leave? Especially with three kids they're doing this with? Oh and they have rental property. They pay you $10/day. I hope your grades are okay. \n\n>They argued that since I am a member of this family, I also have to alleviate some of the burden.\n\nIf they had kids just to use them as labor, I feel like you can stop caring what they think about anything. I mean, you work, do choir, orchestra and sports? NTA. \n\nSome people are just never happy. I swear so many parents are going, well my kid has straight A+'s, 15 AP classes and 14 extra curricular activities and discovered the secret to alchemy in their spare time but they're not grateful I force them to raise their 14 younger siblings, can I disown them? They're telling me they have covered the house in gold and we can sell it to hire a nanny but I like my shiny toilet the way it is now.", "nta\n\nyou can work there if u want, but it doesn't sound like u do. ur not in the wrong here.", "NTA. You say they aren't as bad as many others are saying because they are just trying to provide for the family. I disagree. They may not be doing things out of malice, but that doesn't mean they haven't hurting you for years. You wrote that you feel obligated to work for years with no pay, that they are rarely ever there for your events, that you have to fight to not work 6 days a week,  that you have to fight to take breaks, that you have been conditioned to put everyone else 1st and feel guilty about working less, and that you are a minor and should not be forced into working for free since you were 11 because your parents can't run a restaurant were they actually pay employees. \n\nYou said aren't financially independent. No shit. That's what happens when you don't get paid for your work and your parents take advantage of you. Are you planning on resigning yourself to working there for little to nothing for the rest if your life? Are you going to let the restaurant dictate your life like it has been for years and like it does for your parents? Do you not want a life of your own? You need to get ready to make some hard choices. Will your parents and siblings be upset? Probably, but at some point you need to put yourself 1st and start doing what you want and need to live a happy and successful life.\n\nEdit:  I just saw that you get paid in tips and make less than minimum wage. That isn't any better imo.", "Not really TA for venting your frustrations. Maybe TA for being a little hurtful. You are allowed to feel that way. Not everyone is built for or wants to do restaurant work. Front of the house, or back, both can be tough. \n\nI've known a some restaurant families... Every one of them sounds exactly like what you describe. The kids are expected to do it for the good of the family. From what I have seen, it seems to drive kids off once they are capable of breaking free thus making it hard for the restaurant to become a generational business. I can only think of one person that stayed on after college.", "NTA if i were you i wouldnt work a second more for free and if they dont like it they can talk to CPS and the police, what theyre doing is not legal from a business standpoint and super shitty coming from your parents. I recommend going to the library after school to study or the park, see if you have friends thatll study with you at their house, hell get a job somewhere that actually pays you and then get out of that house as soon as you can.", "ESH.\n\nYour parents should NOT be working you this hard at the business. Yes, kids should help out at a family business WITH PAY, but it really sounds over-the-top.\n\nHowever, your response was pretty over-the-top, too. It sounds like you let a lot of anger build up over years, rather than addressing things at the time. Totally understandable, given your age, but you said some pretty harsh things.", "YTA for saying the things you said.\n\nNTA for feeling the way you're feeling.\n\nYour parents are TA too for taking advantage of child labor and not understanding the mental and physical toll it's taking on you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You'd be far better off working for literally anyone else. \n\nIf your parents' business has to rely on unpaid-by-them labor, they're as bad at being business owners as they are at being parents - and that's pretty damn bad. Are they planning on always having an unpaid labor source around? If not, what do they think is going to happen when their kids grow up? Are they going to be the boss of you forever? Because it sure as hell seems like they think they are.\n\nEdit: holy shit, OP says elsewhere the parents own and rent out two homes (besides the one they live in). Here I was thinking they were forced to exploit their kids because what kind of parent would be that terrible to their kids if they didn't have to be - but nope, they are actively choosing to be absolutely awful to OP and OP's siblings *for no good reason other than that they can.* Betcha that extra money is NOT going to fund the kids' colleges? \n\nOP, run.

Totally agree with the pinching pennies at their children's expense/rental properties income. I must have missed that part. Anyway, that is not good. The people I knew were paid, what really seemed to be the wedge was the hours. They were working so much, and going to school too. Frankly, this isn't the 1900's where a kid goes to school, then goes down to the mill to work a shift afterword (\\*). That's expecting too much. Nowadays, they need time to be kids. I'm on the OP's side, meaning that I'd be pissed too. \n\n\\* I'm not making light of people or families that have to do that sort of thing to survive rough times.
