My parents came to visit for the weekend, and several times my mom used language like \"we love getting to come visit (my name)\" and referencing things as \"(My Name)'s house\" and \"(My Name)'s dog\" etc... phrasing things like my wife was not an equal part of my life or their lives. She also called her sister at one point on speaker phone and used all the same language, \"We're visiting (my name)...\" This was not new, but extra prevalent on this last visit. (Otherwise, they were very friendly and inviting.)\n\nAfter they left, my wife brought up to me again that this bothered her a lot (I agree), and I worked up the courage to call my mom to make her aware and ask her to be more careful of her wording in the future. My mom apologized at first, but then became very defensive that it's not a big deal and \"You and (your wife) are one\" so we shouldn't be upset by that language. I stood my ground that my wife's feelings were hurt (regardless of my mom's opinion) and we left the conversation on a weird note.\n\nMy Dad then called me a week later and said he consulted counselors and pastors who all said we shouldn't be upset about this small of a thing (which I thought was weird). He said small things like this shouldn't get brought up in relationships and we should brush it aside and not get offended. Again I stood my ground that my wife's feelings are still valid.\n\nMaybe we are being too sensitive and we shouldn't have brought it up. I'm glad I did because my wife feels heard, but my parents are offended and confused. I'm confused at my dad's comment about consulting so many people.

But too small of an issue for you to bring up??\n\nLol.  NTA", "NTA\u2026. perhaps you should consider doing the same thing to your mom\u2026 and just calling everything your dad\u2019s from now on when you reference her, you know \u201cwe thought we\u2019d come over to Dad\u2018s house\u201d, \u201c we\u2019d like to see Dad\u201d, \u201c we were interested in what Dad was doing today\u201d. \u201cWe really miss Dad\u201d. \u201cIt was so good to see Dad today \u201c, and see how she likes the turn about it is fair play after all.", "NTA\n\nIf it\u2019s such a small deal, they wouldn\u2019t have needed to consult every spiritual leader in a 50-mile radius about it.\n\nIt\u2019s OK to be confused by someone\u2019s feelings and preferences, it\u2019s not OK to disrespect them.\n\nHave your parents always been able to find something wrong with any request that they treat you differently or change their behavior?", "NTA be sure to tell him you consulted Redditors and we think it\u2019s as big a deal as you want to make it.", "I\u2019d be curious how your mom would feel if you kept saying you were glad to go visit \u201cyour dad.\u201d\n\nNTA. They *may* have really meant no harm, but you spoke up politely to express that it was hurting your family unit, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that!", "NTA, and if they're going to bring the Bible into it, you can remind them of Romans 14, where Christians are asked to be mindful of actions that they may not see as super impactful but cause someone else hurt. They're hurting their DIL by not recognizing her and they need to understand and own that. Fixing the issue literally costs them no effort whatsoever.", "NTA. Just because they don\u2019t think it matters doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t. It matters to you and your wife and that should be enough. \ud83d\udc95", "I find it interesting that your parents put more stock in the opinions of those outside the family than their own daughter in law and, by extension, their own son. NTA. Thank you for sticking up for your wife.", "NTA\n\nYou need to start correcting her in person every time she does it. \n\nWhen she says it isn't a big deal, tell yes, you know it shouldn't be a big deal to say  BOTH names. You don't know why  she can't follow a simple request. \n\nWhen your dad says he consulted X,Y, and Z person. Next time, tell him you consulted the entire internet and we are ALL on your side. So, you have more people backing your  request to be inclusive of your wife than your dad does. So there. \n\nOr stop inviting them over, if there can't. And tell them the truth when they  inevitably  ask why  they  aren't allowed over anymore.", "Put my wife's name in your mother fucking mouth\n\nWill Smith is TAH", "NTA. I think it\u2019s funny he talked to counselors and pastors and you\u2019re over here on Reddit lol. Not in a bad way though. I love it here \n\nEven if it really was unintentional of your mom to do, I don\u2019t believe she nor your dad should have gotten that upset over you bringing it up.", "No offence, but this sounds like \"I saved a newborn baby from a fire but on my way out I stepped on some flowers, AITA?\"\n\nNo, you're NTA. You want your wife to be treated as human being.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s a totally reasonable oversight on your parents\u2019 part. After all, you are their son and the only reason they are visiting is because of you. OTH, I think both you and your wife are very valid in your feelings over the matter and bringing it to their attention is also very valid. I think your parents are feeling very defensive over being called out. I totally get that too but I think they just need to swallow their pride here for a second and realize they are hurting their child\u2019s feelings as well as their DIL\u2019s feelings. They should just apologize and try to do better in the future and move on from being embarrassed. In a way, they\u2019ve made a mountain of of a mole hill by coming back at you for bringing it up. Not the other way around. \n\nBTW, in my family, we always refer to various household\u2019s by both partners\u2019 name. Eg, \u201cwe are going to Jack and Jill\u2019s for Christmas\u201d where Jack is our blood relative. We might even say, we are going to Jack and Jill\u2019s to see Jack but we still acknowledge the house is both of theirs. I think it\u2019s a bit odd your parents don\u2019t include her. I think the average American would. Maybe it is a paternalistic or old fashioned way of looking at things? Donno but it\u2019s odd and worthy of mentioning that it bugs you both.", "NTA\n\nIs your mom normally sexist or is it just for your wife?\n\nWhat your mom said boils my blood, women tend to sacrifice more than a man when it comes to house hold, like she doesn't know that herself. \n\nDid you ever consider cutting her off if she doesn't change.", "I get certain vibes from this... Are your parents the kind of people that go \"blood is thicker than water\"? Because that might explain why they don't seem to acknowedge your wife. If you end up having kids and your parents bring their names up more often than your wife's name... I guess that'd confirm it??\n\nAnyway, I'm going on a tangent. NTA. I can see why you'd think otherwise, since your parents raised you and probably instilled their own values in you. But good for you for noticing something's off and sticking by your wife's side.", "NTA, they're the one's making a big issue about it. \n\n Sadly, that's not an uncommon response of the older parents who can't understand that their adult children are separate human beings with thoughts and feelings of their own. They've never been questioned, never been told 'no' from their kids without punishing them. They don't realize their children are their peers now, and they don't like it.\n\nAlso, major props for supporting your wife!! We need more like you!!", "NTA.  Won\u2019t be a big deal either when LC occurs.\nTheir inability to conform with reasonable requests is a bigger deal.  Parents are selfish, no 2 ways about it.  They\u2019d prefer to be right, rather than be kind.", ">My Dad then called me a week later and said he consulted counselors and pastors\n\nI **guarantee** you those counselors are *not* licensed, accredited therapists. Their opinions are irrelevant, as are those of the pastors.\n\nAll your parents care about is being perceived by others, and being able to perceive themselves, as good people. That's why they're offended, and that's why they've gathered all these other irrelevant opinions to back them up: because they refuse to accept that what they're doing is rude and unkind.\n\nWhat they are doing is unpersoning your wife, and honestly? it sounds to me as though they are doing that deliberately.\n\n(I used to get birthday cards from my in-laws addressed to \"Mrs. <son's first name> <son's last name>\" -- even though they were well aware that I went by \"Ms.\" and I had not taken my husband's last name but had retained my own last name. Christmas cards were addressed to \"Dr. and Mrs. <son's first name> <son's last name>\". They made it very clear that I was only regarded as his accessory, and not as a person in my own right. They were toxic, passive-aggressive people just like your parents, and the divorce was a double relief because it not only meant I didn't have to deal with my ex any more, but that I also no longer had to put up with condescending crap from his parents.)\n\nIf I was in your position, I'd be telling my parents that I would be taking a break from seeing or talking to them until they came to understand that what they are doing is rude and unkind, and were willing to make a *genuine* apology for it.\n\nA genuine apology includes:\n\n* an acknowledgment that they are wrong\n* a specific description of what they've been doing that is wrong\n* an apology which consists simply of \"We're very sorry\" (this *may* be followed by \"for being inconsiderate / rude / unkind / dismissive of you and your wife's feelings\" if it's genuine -- but it is definitely **not** genuine if it's followed by \"that you feel this way / that you took this the wrong way / that you're so oversensitive about this / that your feelings are hurt\")\n* a description of what they will do going forward to not repeat this behavior ever again\n\nI don't have much confidence that your parents will see the light or that you will get a genuine apology from them, given the massive extent they're going to in order to convince themselves and you that what they've been doing is fine.\n\nAnd you and your wife are *not* being over-sensitive, and you are NTA.", "NTA - seems like you brought it up respectfully and were also respectful to your wife\u2019s feelings. If it\u2019s a small thing in their eyes, why not choose the kinder route? Also it\u2019s weird your dad consulted multiple people to justify minimizing ya\u2019lls feelings. There\u2019s so much more going on in ones life, why consult spiritual leaders for this? Your wife just wants to feel like more part of the family, and by them addressing things by only mentioning you, it\u2019s understandable to feel left out.", "\u201cI consulted all the patriarchal misogynists and they said that it\u2019s ok to be rude to your wife.\u201d \n\n-OP\u2019s dad, probably\n\nNTA, OP.

Defensiveness (and your dad\u2019s consultation with various uninvolved parties) often comes from a place of shame. Validate that your mom might feel embarrassed, but your intention was only to ensure everyone feels respected and comfortable when you all spend valuable time together.", "NTA. I think communicating this is healthy and should be respected.", "NAH - your wife's feelings are valid but I think your mom's feelings are valid too. This really does not seem like an evil mother in law thing. I don't blame your mom for being more excited to see her son than the woman he married.
