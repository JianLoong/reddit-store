After all, you are their son and the only reason they are visiting is because of you. OTH, I think both you and your wife are very valid in your feelings over the matter and bringing it to their attention is also very valid. I think your parents are feeling very defensive over being called out. I totally get that too but I think they just need to swallow their pride here for a second and realize they are hurting their child\u2019s feelings as well as their DIL\u2019s feelings. They should just apologize and try to do better in the future and move on from being embarrassed. In a way, they\u2019ve made a mountain of of a mole hill by coming back at you for bringing it up.

Donno but it\u2019s odd and worthy of mentioning that it bugs you both.", "NTA\n\nIs your mom normally sexist or is it just for your wife?\n\nWhat your mom said boils my blood, women tend to sacrifice more than a man when it comes to house hold, like she doesn't know that herself. \n\nDid you ever consider cutting her off if she doesn't change.", "I get certain vibes from this... Are your parents the kind of people that go \"blood is thicker than water\"? Because that might explain why they don't seem to acknowedge your wife. If you end up having kids and your parents bring their names up more often than your wife's name... I guess that'd confirm it??\n\nAnyway, I'm going on a tangent. NTA. I can see why you'd think otherwise, since your parents raised you and probably instilled their own values in you. But good for you for noticing something's off and sticking by your wife's side.", "NTA, they're the one's making a big issue about it. \n\n Sadly, that's not an uncommon response of the older parents who can't understand that their adult children are separate human beings with thoughts and feelings of their own. They've never been questioned, never been told 'no' from their kids without punishing them. They don't realize their children are their peers now, and they don't like it.\n\nAlso, major props for supporting your wife!! We need more like you!!", "NTA.  Won\u2019t be a big deal either when LC occurs.\nTheir inability to conform with reasonable requests is a bigger deal.  Parents are selfish, no 2 ways about it.

Their opinions are irrelevant, as are those of the pastors.\n\nAll your parents care about is being perceived by others, and being able to perceive themselves, as good people. That's why they're offended, and that's why they've gathered all these other irrelevant opinions to back them up: because they refuse to accept that what they're doing is rude and unkind.\n\nWhat they are doing is unpersoning your wife, and honestly? it sounds to me as though they are doing that deliberately.\n\n(I used to get birthday cards from my in-laws addressed to \"Mrs. <son's first name> <son's last name>\" -- even though they were well aware that I went by \"Ms.\" and I had not taken my husband's last name but had retained my own last name. Christmas cards were addressed to \"Dr. and Mrs. <son's first name> <son's last name>\". They made it very clear that I was only regarded as his accessory, and not as a person in my own right. They were toxic, passive-aggressive people just like your parents, and the divorce was a double relief because it not only meant I didn't have to deal with my ex any more, but that I also no longer had to put up with condescending crap from his parents.)\n\nIf I was in your position, I'd be telling my parents that I would be taking a break from seeing or talking to them until they came to understand that what they are doing is rude and unkind, and were willing to make a *genuine* apology for it.\n\nA genuine apology includes:\n\n* an acknowledgment that they are wrong\n* a specific description of what they've been doing that is wrong\n* an apology which consists simply of \"We're very sorry\" (this *may* be followed by \"for being inconsiderate / rude / unkind / dismissive of you and your wife's feelings\" if it's genuine -- but it is definitely **not** genuine if it's followed by \"that you feel this way / that you took this the wrong way / that you're so oversensitive about this / that your feelings are hurt\")\n* a description of what they will do going forward to not repeat this behavior ever again\n\nI don't have much confidence that your parents will see the light or that you will get a genuine apology from them, given the massive extent they're going to in order to convince themselves and you that what they've been doing is fine.\n\nAnd you and your wife are *not* being over-sensitive, and you are NTA.", "NTA - seems like you brought it up respectfully and were also respectful to your wife\u2019s feelings.
