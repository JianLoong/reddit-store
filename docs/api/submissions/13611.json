After all, you are their son and the only reason they are visiting is because of you. OTH, I think both you and your wife are very valid in your feelings over the matter and bringing it to their attention is also very valid. I think your parents are feeling very defensive over being called out. I totally get that too but I think they just need to swallow their pride here for a second and realize they are hurting their child\u2019s feelings as well as their DIL\u2019s feelings.

Donno but it\u2019s odd and worthy of mentioning that it bugs you both.", "NTA\n\nIs your mom normally sexist or is it just for your wife?\n\nWhat your mom said boils my blood, women tend to sacrifice more than a man when it comes to house hold, like she doesn't know that herself. \n\nDid you ever consider cutting her off if she doesn't change.", "I get certain vibes from this... Are your parents the kind of people that go \"blood is thicker than water\"? Because that might explain why they don't seem to acknowedge your wife. If you end up having kids and your parents bring their names up more often than your wife's name... I guess that'd confirm it??\n\nAnyway, I'm going on a tangent. NTA. I can see why you'd think otherwise, since your parents raised you and probably instilled their own values in you. But good for you for noticing something's off and sticking by your wife's side.", "NTA, they're the one's making a big issue about it. \n\n Sadly, that's not an uncommon response of the older parents who can't understand that their adult children are separate human beings with thoughts and feelings of their own. They've never been questioned, never been told 'no' from their kids without punishing them. They don't realize their children are their peers now, and they don't like it.\n\nAlso, major props for supporting your wife!! We need more like you!!", "NTA.  Won\u2019t be a big deal either when LC occurs.\nTheir inability to conform with reasonable requests is a bigger deal.  Parents are selfish, no 2 ways about it.

Their opinions are irrelevant, as are those of the pastors.\n\nAll your parents care about is being perceived by others, and being able to perceive themselves, as good people. That's why they're offended, and that's why they've gathered all these other irrelevant opinions to back them up: because they refuse to accept that what they're doing is rude and unkind.\n\nWhat they are doing is unpersoning your wife, and honestly? it sounds to me as though they are doing that deliberately.\n\n(I used to get birthday cards from my in-laws addressed to \"Mrs. <son's first name> <son's last name>\" -- even though they were well aware that I went by \"Ms.\" and I had not taken my husband's last name but had retained my own last name. Christmas cards were addressed to \"Dr. and Mrs. <son's first name> <son's last name>\". They made it very clear that I was only regarded as his accessory, and not as a person in my own right. They were toxic, passive-aggressive people just like your parents, and the divorce was a double relief because it not only meant I didn't have to deal with my ex any more, but that I also no longer had to put up with condescending crap from his parents.)\n\nIf I was in your position, I'd be telling my parents that I would be taking a break from seeing or talking to them until they came to understand that what they are doing is rude and unkind, and were willing to make a *genuine* apology for it.\n\nA genuine apology includes:\n\n* an acknowledgment that they are wrong\n* a specific description of what they've been doing that is wrong\n* an apology which consists simply of \"We're very sorry\" (this *may* be followed by \"for being inconsiderate / rude / unkind / dismissive of you and your wife's feelings\" if it's genuine -- but it is definitely **not** genuine if it's followed by \"that you feel this way / that you took this the wrong way / that you're so oversensitive about this / that your feelings are hurt\")\n* a description of what they will do going forward to not repeat this behavior ever again\n\nI don't have much confidence that your parents will see the light or that you will get a genuine apology from them, given the massive extent they're going to in order to convince themselves and you that what they've been doing is fine.\n\nAnd you and your wife are *not* being over-sensitive, and you are NTA.", "NTA - seems like you brought it up respectfully and were also respectful to your wife\u2019s feelings.

You need to examine this relationship very carefully. Your parents are minimizing your relationship and erasing your wife from your life by mot including her name. Do not allow these people into your house again. Your father is trying to control the situation by saying he discussed this with others: he wants you to believe it isn't a problem that your mother won't include your wife but it is and it matter how many pastors say so.", "Do the some think to your mom", "NTA. \n\nThese \u201csmall things\u201d add up and eventually lead to bigger things and knowing your partner has your back makes it a little easier. Speaking from experience, unfortunately.", "NTA\n\nAs a couple, yes you guys are a unit. But that does not take away your individuality. Something like this usually wouldn't be an issue, sure. However, if someone is uncomfortable with it then yes. It's now an issue and it doesn't take much to respect it.", "Just refer to your Mom  Dad's wife from now.   Don't be serious about it , just exagerate  it with a big smile on your face,  ham it up call her \"you wife\". \n\n If you get too serious about it then the breach in the family is hard to repair but if you make a huge joke of it they will have to give in or be subject to your 'jokes' forever.", "NTA, good job standing up for your wife.\n\nReligion is poison.", "NTA this is disrespectful. Your wife had a wish, and they doesnt care because they have zero respect towards her. I would die on that hill. Its about respect, not just the unreasonable communication.", "This sounds a lot like different generations communicating differently, as well as some mild old fashion misogyny.\n\nYour parents talk differently, use different word choices, slang, swears, etc. And in doing so, the communication is sometimes 80% instead of 100%. This could be the case with your mom and the situation with your wife. \n\nThere's also just the time when you mom grew up, vs the times now. Older people will sometimes refer to a household by the patriarchs name, and other property. She refers to it as your home, your stuff, etc but not your wife. This is especially true for conservative people with religion in their life that has a focus on this patriarchy.\n\nYou're NTA for bringing it up with your parents. You should have your wife talk it out with your mom, to clear up any mis-communication / disrespect, then move on with your lives. Even if your mom sometimes says something a little off.", "NTA.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter that the pastor isn\u2019t bothered. You are. Your wife is. \n\nAnd if it was truly a very small deal, your parents would change their language and not poll the county to try to explain why they shouldn\u2019t have to. \n\nIf it\u2019s not a big deal, they can fix it. But it\u2019s big enough that you and your wife are bothered. And it\u2019s big enough that your parents are defensive - they are putting energy in to defend this practice. They\u2019d rather be seen as disrespectful to your wife than include her in how they talk. And they want you to not mention it again. \n\nF that. They don\u2019t have to come over to your and your wife\u2019s house.", "NTA.  \n\n>He said small things like this shouldn't get brought up in relationships and we should brush it aside and not get offended.\n\nThen why did they? Like, it's weird that they're so hung up on such a small thing (according to them).  \n\nIf I were in your mom's shoes, I'd find your wife's complaint something a bit odd to be sensitive about. But it's not like it's some big burden to do as requested either. Your wife's feelings matter. Even if I (or your mom) think they're odd, they're still worth respecting.", "NTA and your parents are creepy.", "Your mother is just being a jerk on purpose and she didn\u2019t think you would say anything.", "NTA", "Or for them to apologize and promise to do better .", "Was coming here to say this, you beat me to it!", "I fuckjng like this idea!", "Perfect \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb", "\"Wow Dad, your marinara was especially good today, no wonder it took your wife 20 years to master the recipe\"\n\n\"Sure dad, we can come home and visit you for the holidays\"", "Agreed, in my experience it\u2019s more common for people to say \u201cI\u2019m going to (person they have the stronger connection to)\u2019s house,\u201d rather than \u201cperson and person\u2019s house.\u201d It\u2019s more about brevity and established connections than slighting the unnamed individual.

Are we being assholes?\". Sort of like what op is doing right now.

Or pastors who think parents should always be venerated and never questioned or criticized?", "Fucking toxic right? I would die on that hill, its about respect and respecting the wish of OPs wife. If they have zero respect for her then I would go low contact, like the LoTR Mines of Moria.", "Or if he did, he gave them a biased version of the story."]}
