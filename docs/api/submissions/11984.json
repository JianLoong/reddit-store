You helped this group save money but not only hosting but also by providing a ride back. Your reasoning about if they had said they disagreed you would\u2019ve paid them because it\u2019s not worth ruining a friendship, shows that you didn\u2019t intend this to be a big issue. It\u2019s your friend who chose to react this way and is someone I would not want as a friend after they chose to escalate. It\u2019s also not fair to only ask you to help cover the costs of the Uber. \n\nI am curious though, with the other people not paying their share are they now expecting you to pay half the cost of the Uber or was the Uber like $40 and so split amongst 4 people they believe you owe $10?", "NTA - I would ask them to Venmo you for part of the food and your BF\u2019s gas to pick them up and ride back.
