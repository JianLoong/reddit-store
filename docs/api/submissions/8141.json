If not exactly for this exact situation, your actual title. I see you only disclosed in a comment your daughter 16, fair enough she\u2019s definitely not a very young child or anything. However you left your girlfriend, the only true and real adult, alone with your daughter. She didn\u2019t try to tell your daughter she couldn\u2019t go to the party, you had already made that decision and that\u2019s fine. Your girlfriend thought your daughter was presenting herself too provocatively, for whatever reason, and attempted to rectify that. Presumably your girlfriend knows how your daughter normally presents herself, which would be in accordance with whatever you approve of. Your girlfriend clearly saw something else going on there that night, and in your absence tried to correct it, whether in error or not. \n\nMaybe they should\u2019ve called you, maybe your girlfriend should\u2019ve taken a picture and sent it to you.\n\nBut your title is a blanket statement, and a possibly dangerous and assholish one.   If your daughter did something clearly wrong or neglected a chore or insulted your girlfriend, you\u2019re not giving your girlfriend the autonomy and authority to say something about it?", "YTA You can't leave a child with an adult and give the adult no authority. It would be different if you were there.", "YTA\n\nHow can you go away on a trip, expect your GF to look after your Daughter but not parent her in a way? You left her as guardian/responsible adult. As such she is gonna need to parent", "YTA!!!\n\nFirst, you need to understand there are two ways to look at this.  There is the legal side, and there is the moral side.  Your GF, as in loco parentis, has a legal obligation to act as a \\*parent\\* (not step-parent) in the absence of any other parent figure.  In the eyes of the law, if you leave your minor daughter in the care of your girlfriend, your girlfriend has the same legal obligation to ENGAGE as a parent...as if your girlfriend actually was the birth mother.  That's the legal view.  How this works in practice.  Let's say your daughter sneaks out of the house and steals beer from the local supermarket....\n\nAs the adult in charge at the time, your girlfriend could be facing serious legal charges for that, as she failed to properly supervise your daughter, as any mother would.  So to say or even IMPLY that your girlfriend is less of a parent than you are is wrong.  You can only make that argument when you are HOME.  A different situation exists if you are out camping with your buddies.  \n\nFrom the moral perspective...this works pretty much the same.  If you don't expect your girlfriend to engage as a parent (a FULL parent) then morally speaking...you have abandoned your minor daughter by leaving her alone without proper supervision.\n\nSo right off the bat, you are double AH.\n\nNow let's explore the specific situation.  Women of all ages wear way too much makeup.  It's really not appropriate at any age.  But it's especially disturbing to see a minor child do this.  Women, for the most part...will be tolerant of kids experimenting with make-up, even if they overdo it a bit.  That is because the perspective is a bit skewed.  For a person who wears too much make-up, she's less likely to notice or object to another person wearing too much make-up.\n\nMy Point?  If a woman gets upset over a girl dressing \"provocative\" then it's most likely the deal that the way she is dressed and made up is WAY over-the-top...especially for a minor child.  Side speculation...I'm betting your daughter thought she could be sneaky that one night, because she knew that \"dad\" wasn't home.  (GREEN LIGHT to GO WILD!!!)\n\nSpeaking as a father of one boy and one girl...if my girlfriend got all over my daughter for dressing provocatively and I found out about that?  My daughter would be in double trouble.  She'd be punished both for the way she dressed, but also for disrespecting my girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend did nothing wrong, and everything right.  You owe her a huge apology.  And you need to discipline your daughter, also.", "YTA if she\u2019s your girlfriend she automatically has some power to tell you daughter what to do you are very unreasonable", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let's look at another scenario where your daughter wanted to snort coke and have an orgy and your girlfriend did not stop her- you would be angry and have every right to be. Yes, this is extreme, but equally possible. NTA- but better communication and well established expectations are needed so your girlfriend knows what is expected.

A 16 yr-old is not an adult and while your gf was wrong to intervene in this situation it is possible a situation will come up where your gf needs to be the adult and tell your daughter no but she won\u2019t be able to. I think you need to have a talk about what would be an appropriate situation to intervene in (cause there aren\u2019t going to be many). Like if you say daughter can go to a party but must be home by midnight and daughter says she\u2019s spending the night gf needs to feel empowered enough to at least be able to say, \u201cThat\u2019s not what your dad agreed to we need to ask him first\u201d.

If you would leave your 16-year-old home to care for herself for a weekend, then your girlfriend shouldn't be able to say anything to her. However, if you're leaving your 16-year-old home with your girlfriend to care for her through the weekend, then you are leaving her in the position of a guardian and it's quite reasonable for her to act as such.", "I'm interested to know how your GF responded to what's been said. Could your daughter be over stating or misunderstanding the conversation? Could your GF simply have said something like \"that makeup is a bit much, are you sure about it?\" (Still the wrong thing but not a demand to change it) and your daughter took it the wrong way? What is their general relationship like? Does your daughter like your girlfriend? I guess what I'm getting at is could this be a total misunderstanding between two people who are finding their way in a complex relationship? I'm a grown ass adult and still found it difficult to adjust when my dad settled with his GF, who I love now but did feel uncomfortable with for the first few years.\n\nAbsolutely a 16 year old still needs parenting but you've made it clear to your GF that she is not parenting your daughter so assuming that your daughter is repeating accurately what was said between them (not an accusation just speaking as a mum and a stepmum and a daughter and knowing humans are brilliant at misunderstanding stuff) then NTA. Your GF overstepped and needs to back off. \n\nHowever if your plan is to continue a relationship with your GF then you need to sit down and have a civil adult conversation with them both.

She didn't stop her from going out anything like that, she did something that looks to me like an act of care.

I've analysed the crap out of this... in response to another comment....\n\n>So when you hire babysitter or get a friend to babysit - you dont pass PARENTAL AUTHORITY over. They dont become the kids parent. Any issues - you contact the parent and ask is this allowed and then the parent intervenes if need be. You dont punish someone elses kid.\n\nYour post has actually helped me clarify the issue in my head a bit....\nSo when you hire a baby sitter, you don't hand over PARENTAL authority over, no. But you do hand over to some extent LEGAL and ETHICAL authority.\n\nI think this is where people are arguing. Because asking a teen to change make up is seen as a more parental duty. So yes, I think we can all agree that the gf stepped into parent duties without permission.\n\nHowever OP seems to indicate that ANY type of direction or advice given from the gf to the daughter is not cool. So it would be difficult in the case of living with a minor if you had to intervene for moral or ethical reasons.\n\nNow, OP says that he wants his gf just like that, not as a babysitter. So that should release the gf to not bother about the daughter at all.\n\nHOWEVER, hands up who did stupid/risky stuff when they were a teen? Or a parent that has a teen? We all know that sometimes adults need to step in and save them from themselves and gently explain/put boundaries in place. So by the OPs post, HE is the only one that can do that. So what happens when he leaves for the weekend? Who is monitoring this lovely young girl? OP doesn't seem to be. We have no information on how mature this 16yo girl actually is. Maybe she is trustworthy to a T. Maybe she is not, all the time, and OP is being neglectful. We simply do not know.\n\nIt would be hard, for a strong moral and ethical person to sit back and watch a teen nose dive without saying anything to them while their parent is away. I feel for the gf. But.. the gf might have control issues and be a bit of a irritant. Once again we do not know.\n\nThere needs to be communication between them. When is it ok to step in, and not ok, ethically?\n\nAnd the point about babysitters calling parents when something happens..... yes that happens with big things. Not every, little, tiny thing. I've baby sat for 20 years. Do the parents trying to have a night off want me to blow up their phone every time a child says they don't like peas for dinner, refuses to go to bed, grizzles about wanting more tv or annoyed at being told off for pinching his sister? No. Parents want to feel comfortable that they are safe and secure in your care. What if a kid picked up a knife at the dinner table, and was about to ram it in the toddlers eye for fun? Do the parents want me to call them up and chat about it, or do they want me to intervene immediately to reduce harm? \n\nSame with this situation. If the teen was acting erratically, would OP then want the gf to act and intervene quickly? Obviously not the make up situation. But that time will come, and the gf will feel torn. That is why they need to talk about it. OP also said he went camping. What if he is somewhere where there is no reception. OP would have felt irritated when he arrived home, and that would have been stressful. He obviously sounds angry. After a cool down, a talk about what made the gf make the makeup comment would be useful. And next time, what should happen.\n\nMy opinion, if you put people like this in a house together, a natural family dynamic forms. If you don't want a family, and a family dynamic, break it. The gf shouldn't be living with them. And OP seems to have deep seated issues surrounding the mothering of his daughter, coming out in how he talks (as it seems the actually mother has sadly passed).Is there something going on emotionally for him that he needs to address? I think individual therapy for him, and family therapy for all of them if they want to keep living this way.", "So if your daughter went out and got in shit or something happened to her because your gf isn\u2019t allowed to intervene what would your reaction be? \n\nDo you trust your gf who I assume is of legal age around your age (35-45) to provide guidance and direction to your daughter that best sets her up for success? \n\nFor your gf, do you guys have the same values in raising children etc?

I would say you\u2019re bringing this person into your life\u2026 that\u2019s your entire life, you want her to care for your daughter and take some responsibility in their safety and uprising which means she should have some level of say to protect her.

I don't have kids so honestly I'm sure there are a million possible situations that I would never think of but you really need to talk through these kinds of things.\n\n\"Don't tell my daughter she can't do something I already approved\" is a reasonable boundary to set. But \"you will never have any sort of parental responsibility\" is just not very realistic.\n\nThis is a hard line to walk! It will require a lot of communication between the three of you, and some flexibility to maybe revise as new issues and conflicts come up in the future. If you all go into it in good faith and willing to forgive each other's miststeps that will make it a lot easier.", "Yeah, seriously if its not black/yellow/brown face, it's just makeup. GF should have only intervened if the makeup was wildly inappropriate (to the point of being canceled) and should have called dad first. GF messed up.", "Agreed. I think this term is only appropriate regarding makeup if, for example, the makeup is racist such as black face or yellow face. Or a swastika painted on their forehead. That IS provocative and totally inappropriate. But otherwise, not a word I would use. Overly heavy? Maybe. Wrong color for skin tone? Sure. But provocative? No.", "I really can't understand how makeup can be provocative??? Did she draw dicks all over lol", "Absolutely.

Hey: don\u2019t forget your mace. Do you have a plan to deal with creepers? \n\nShe\u2019s 19 now but I still do the safety drills when she leaves for a cosplay event.", "I don't think age matters that much? OP isn't asking for judgement on leaving his daughter with the GF, not on letting her go to a party. I don't see anything else that could make him an asshole if the daughter was younger.", "Completely agree. And my mother did exactly that. I was allowed to play with makeup at home from a young age. When I was 14 she took me to Clinique to learn how to choose colors and apply properly in order to begin wearing it to school.", "Yes!! This is how I've handled things with my stepdaughter over the past 15yrs. Never had any drama because of it. If her bio parents are fine with it - who am I to say otherwise?", "Step-parent here as well. \n\nGranted, the boys are a lot younger... but I just wanted to second that feeling of feeling responsible for them.  I mean, I think with the ages of my boys, it was never a question that I'd be taking on that role.. but I'd question the personality of someone who could live in a house with a child and be okay with just being around and not taking on any of that role", "I really agree with this", "I wish my kids' fathers (my kids are 6 years apart) would've married women like you. For real. You handled that so well. Exactly how that should be handled. In my situation, the stepmoms have made my kids miserable and one even psychologically abused my child (she's now an ex-stepmom). I don't think any of that would've happened if they would've handled things like you've described. \n\nI can see dad's side of not wanting the girlfriend to parent his daughter also, though. My daughter is 17. Even at 16, if I were dating someone, I would ask him not to tell her what to do unless she asks him for advice. But she has a REALLY good head on her shoulders and rarely gets into trouble. I've been both helping her to and allowing her her to steadily gain more independence since the age of 16 so that when she becomes an adult and goes off on her own, she isn't like a fish out of water.  So even I'm doing less parenting of my daughter that age. If she were younger, though, like age 9, I think it would be reasonable for the stepmom (or a boyfriend in my case) to take on more of a caregiver role when necessary. And if they'd handle things the way you did, coming to me first for things like this, well that would just be amazing.", "You gave me an amazing idea for my two girls, youngest isn\u2019t into makeup like someone her sisters age, but for my oldest (11years old), definitely will take her to look at make up and learn some techniques at a make up store or counter. That\u2019s if and when she is really interested it/asks me about it. :) I agree with everything you said before and after!", "Me too! I would put way too much eye liner on and then vigorously rub it. I thought I looked fantastic, but... I didn't. My mom didn't say a word, she just let me express myself and I'm really happy about that now. Oh, I miss the early 2000s, but I'm not running to the shops to buy those low rise jeans now that they're back.", "Lol same! And let\u2019s not forget the hair!", "If there are 25 year olds at a party for 16 year olds, don\u2019t you think that constitutes an issue entirely independent of what kind of makeup this girl is wearing? You\u2019re on a slippery slope bud. Makeup and clothing is never the cause of an unwanted sexual advance.", "Not the gf\u2019s business. Not the gf\u2019s place to try to make it out to be the daughter\u2019s responsibility how a man would look at her makeup. \n\nMen need to control themselves. If they can\u2019t then they shouldn\u2019t leave their mother\u2019s basement.", "The GF is for sure wrong, but it's no where near as grevious as your trying to make it sound.  This sub has a problem with being overly dramatic.\n\nI mean, adults in adult relationships that work, understand these minor altercations happen from time to time, and are able to handle these in calm situations.\n\nIt's not \"slut shamming\" when dealing with litteral children.  Stop throwing your buzzwords around, they don't make a point for you.", "That would provoke somerhing, for sure!", "If provocative in the gfs comment meant slutty... I don't know if drawn tits are that lol\n\nThen again I don't totally grasp the idea behind provocative makeup at all. All kinds of glam looks are so mainstream nowadays that you really can't relate makeup look to anyone's morals, character or... Anything. Other than the fact that they most likely like makeup.", "lol this is the age gap between my youngest brother and I. She needs to step back or move out. She crossed an important boundary. Maybe put off the move until daughter leaves the house?

I read it, and I am specifically saying it's unrealistic for him to expect an adult cohabitating with a minor to hold zero authority over said minor, so instead there should be a conversation about rules, boundaries what should and shouldn't be situations for her to step in on. Like it or not, if there's a minor in the home there will be times where an adult may need to step in. \n\nI by no means am a parent to my sisters' kids but when we've lived together I absolutely had the authority to correct them, within the bounds that we the adults discussed. Had their been no authority then any time their parents weren't around it would have been a few for all which isn't realistic.", "That seems incredibly reasonable pop. Keep being a good dad.", "Sounds like the daughter complied with the idiot girlfriend's request, then brought the issue to her actual parent. What's disrespectful about that?", "I am also confused by this comment lol", "Me too. I think gf\u2019s comments are unwarranted but 16 years old is still a minor, the daughter needs some kind of guardian at least while dad is away. Not saying gf should be dictating her makeup and looks but a 16 year old should have someone looking out for them in the case of emergency, at the bare minimum.", "I mean, it's just coloured grease. \n\nAll the \"bad men are gonna get you\" is just victim-blaming and smug self-congratulation.", "Lol \u2026 \u201cI compliment it, or not, as the spirit moves me.\u201d \n\nAs a mom of a teenager, this cracked me up\u2026 because SAME! Haha! You really have to walk on eggshells when you compliment a teenage girl! Sometimes it\u2019s just best to not say anything at all!", "I'm over here confused on how her makeup was considered provocative? Did she have \"FUCK U\" written in eyeliner on her forehead or something?", "Exactly! She was def wrong, but I think the response as well as OP\u2019s comments indicate that there may be some lack of clearly stating expectations.", "If the daughter comes home drunk, she comes home drunk and dad will deal with her later. School wouldn't never call GF if dad doesn't specifically add her to a list. If daughter calls for a ride because she's intoxicated or her ride was, she's likely going to call dad, because GF is not a step mom. If she calls GF its because she sees her as equal or respects her enough to help. I'm also assuming that dad was never out of contact, otherwise he'd say so and lay down rules for how things work with GF. GF was specifically told not to interfere with a certain situation that was already approved. GF interfered anyways.

Not saying gf was justified at ALL!", "Eh, if the daughter was trying to leave the house wearing very heavy makeup at, say, age 9, I could see  intervening.  \"Provocative\" is not a word I would ever use to describe one's makeup, but I don't think it's age appropriate for young children to wear makeup that makes them look like mature teens or adults. As it stands though, the GF is definitely the asshole.", "Expecting that an adult living in the same household as a minor will not provide any kind of input whatsoever into the minor\u2019s life is kind of an AH move.", "Exactly what my mom did. Now when my SD is old enough we will offer to pay for it and offer bio mom the opportunity to take SD first. If she doesn\u2019t want to, then I will. But I think SD\u2019s bio mom should get the opportunity if she wants it.", "I did similarly with my daughter. She's been allowed to play with makeup looks at home since she's been able to apply it but I made her wash it off before leaving the house when she was younger. When she turned 14, I started allowing light makeup like mascara to school or in public, and then it progressed from there as she got older, and now she's 17 and most of her Christmas presents were quality makeup pallets in all kinds of colors and brushes, etc. She's better at applying different eyeshadow looks than I am at this point and I'm really proud of her for it because it's so dang artistic.", "Yeah, I usually privately give my husband my thoughts and then it\u2019s for him and mom to decide. I can\u2019t imagine I would ever put my foot down unless I truly felt the kids were unsafe somehow. But if he was letting his kids do objectively unsafe things, I wouldn\u2019t be with him. So I doubt this scenario will ever come up. \n\nSo at the end of the day, sure, they let the kids do some things before I probably would if I was the decision maker, but nothing unsafe or harmful, so who am I to try to undermine that?", "God forbid a lady at marriageable age shows off her assets!

The girlfriend is close with OP, but she's explicitly _not_ a stepmom or parental figure to the daughter, so I think roommate is the best descriptor.\n\n_Parenting_ is a different story.  There's no need for the girlfriend to, for example, make the daughter do her homework. No basis for the girlfriend to ground her for breaking curfew. No basis for, as in the story, putting restrictions on what clothing and makeup she can wear.  That's not roommate territory. At most, she could inform OP of any concerns, but it's up to OP whether he wants to act on them.\n\nObviously in general, adults have a duty to step in if a kid is in danger or up to something especially bad.

I've learned that most of us will be criticized no matter what, and one of my great epiphanies in life was realizing that I'd rather be criticized for doing what I thought was right than bending to pressure against my better judgment, and end up being criticized for doing what I thought was wrong. (With \"right\" and \"wrong\" being shades of grey, of course.)", "exactly, even if the gf stops trying to prevent, she\u2019ll start trying to shame the daughter", "Oh yeah. Mine gave me that and also an undying unease/fear of strange men looking down my top/up my skirt. Tbf they probably were, but why put that on 14 year old me?", "You too? My mom tried to tell me what to wear until I was 16. I had such a hard time figuring out who I was and all because 'what would the neighbors think' mentality. Also, thanks mom!", "I have never understood why parents don't let their kids dye their hair. It's the one time in life you can do so without any real consequences. Many of us grow up and enter into careers where we have to look corporate all the time and would have loved to be able to really express ourselves before that. I can't see who it hurts for kids to have pink hair. \n\n(I went to Catholic school, so this isn't on my parents. One of my classmates got detention for wearing tinted Chapstick).", "my nephew is going through that phase now, my sister is like, it's your body but you ARE going to be in photos lol", "I revealed the fact that I attempted to dye my hair with Kool aid and you're questioning my eyebrows? Lmao\n\nCombination of teenage poor decisions, it being the \"scene kid\" style to do it and draw eyebrows on in black pencil liner for a while, and an abusive/controlling parent that led me to go crazy with what little control over my own life I had, which basically solely extended to hair, eyebrows, sex, and self injury in many different forms lol", "Some dude is arguing with me in another comment thread lol", "I've noticed that the subject gets changed here a lot. They eventually get back to answering the question, it just might take a while.", "With purple eyeliner", "With Guess stonewashed jeans!", "I loved that stuff!", "I did that, but no white lipstick.", "Same. I was a little kid in the 80's, and the make up choices for that decade are unforgettable, but the 90's....let's just say that I have learned from my mistakes lol.", "I still adore her.  \ud83e\udd70", "Exactly. And luckily, as much as they loved fashion and clothes it didn't involve the overly sexy crap. And i really didn't care about pink hair etc.", "I have 2 daughters, 22 and 15, and I have made a conscience effort to never comment on theirs or my own weight or put myself down in front of them as well as never discouraging them from dressing however they want. I would hate to be the one to clip their wings and mess with their self esteem. \n\nMy oldest jokingly asked me why I never intervened during her over filled in eyebrow phase when she was about 14-15. She had a Joan Crawford look going on for sure, they were *VERY* defined lol.", "As someone with a she-mullet in my senior portrait, I thank you for this and so will your kid.", "[removed]", "I had the opposite and am forever grateful. I remember once putting on some shorts and I was all \u2018these are too short, my legs are too big to wear shorts like this\u2019. And my mom announced  \u2018you and all the women in your family have strong, big legs and you\u2019re going to wear those short shorts with pride!\u2019 And then o went to a chorus concert with tiny shorts, stood singing in front of audience and haven\u2019t looked back since. \n\n Growing up with a big ass and a tiny waist in the 90s heroin chic world wasn\u2019t easy. I\u2019d like to say I feel vindicated now, but mostly I\u2019m just annoyed at the power of arbitrary beauty standards on virtually all of us. If my mom had reacted differently I\u2019d probably have only worn pants forever.", "You were wearing more clothes than just shorts, was it only the lace part she didnt like? I bet it looked super cute tho!", "\"Wear black. It's slimming.\" Mom used to say all the time even though literally none of us were overweight.", "I got called a whore by my grandfather when I was in primary school for trying on his wife's (my grandmother's) colour-changing lipstick. Wasn't going to go out of the house or anything, but hey. I still remember those words.", "I am sorry your mom treated you that way. My daughter is 10 and puberty is starting. She is beautiful and outgoing.  She also make questionable clothing choices that I veto. I don't insult her or would insinuate that she is in the wrong, but the world is a fucked up place I want to keep her safe. It's walking a balance beam of wanting her to express her individuality/fashion sense and not attracting creeps. I want her to stay innocent, but not na\u00efve about the world.", "Yes, you may have crippling self-esteem. But at least a stranger did not silently judge you about your clothes.\n\n/s", "Just don't shame your kids for being themselves and you should be OK", "That's pretty much all you can do: your best. You will fuck up your child somehow, it's almost unavoidable. But as long as your work on your own personal growth, while teaching your child to love and respect themselves, you're doing great.", "Same with my daughter! When she was 9 she saw a pic of Sinead O\u2019Connor and wanted to shave her head. Her dad and I talked about it with her to be sure she really wanted to shave her waist length completely off and she said \u201cyep, I\u2019ll donate it to be made into a wig!\u201d (Her grandmother he just died of cancer, and she\u2019d had a wig made of donated hair, and my girl thought that was awesome). When I took her to our hairdresser, she refused to shave it off completely and instead gave her a pixie cut.  My daughter was disappointed, but I gave her a choice. I can finish the job or we could dye it whatever color she chose. She liked the idea, and chose pink. With magenta lowlights. This started our six year adventure of hair coloring! She had every color/combination imaginable throughout those years.  Today she\u2019s an esthetician and special effects makeup artist.", "my sister lets her kid do whatever he wants as long as school/work allows but he pays someone to do, his mom would mess it up lol", "Pink hair for my daughter when she was 10. I figured that one day she likely won\u2019t have the ability to do it when she is an adult and needs to conform to work standards so let her have fun now and do what she wants so long as it\u2019s safe", "Right!!! This is the best way to view it. It makes her feel so good about herself when she's allowed to look the way she wants. I am so glad my school didn't say anything about hair, which surprises me since it was a strict catholic school. I wouldn't listen if the school said anything about my hair tho at that time", "Well, good on you, but my mom never helped me participate in my weirdness. She just didn\u2019t intervene with how I looked heading out the door.", "My kiddos are now 12 and 10 and I\u2019ve been letting them put crazy colors in their hair since we were all bored at home during COVID in 2020. It\u2019s just hair.", "This is so true. As a kid you love being bright and colourful so why not let them truly express themselves and have fun doing so.  Detention for Chapstick that's crazy, I got in shit when they asked who goes to church on Sundays and I'm the only one who didn't raise my hand and my teacher asked me why and because I said it's the day to sleep in and football \ud83e\udd23 omg I had to stay back on my lunch break and he tried to get ahold of my parents about it and my dad said that I was right. He knew if he tried to give me shit it will back fire on him", "I'm glad my mom doesn't look at tattoos that way. I've got a few specifically for both parents and she said they were nice but she still doesn't like tats. Now I'm working on a giant snake back piece and she's terrified of snakes so she just tells me I'm a huge freak and will laugh. She also thinks it's funny that I have more tats than all 4 of my brothers combined", "I'm 54 and I have two tattoos. One above my ankle of a Celtic Cross and an infinity sign with the letter of my daughters' first names woven in on the inside of my left wrist.\n\nThe level of anger leveled at me when I got my second tat, you would have thought I'd done something criminal and extremely disrespectful towards them because I \"know how they feel about that\". \n\nThese are small tattoos, easily covered up. But you know they don't really respect my boundaries. The concept eludes them. They are in their eighties\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love them dearly, and I will take care of them for as long as I am physically able to. But, while I love them, there are times I don't like them very much. But it goes away pretty quickly", "Ohhhhhh drama!!! LoL", "Oh I know lol if I get bored reading them I find something else\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Or z cavariccis!", "I mean even the sexy crap. It's just exploring fashion and your own personal sexual power. As long as it's safe it's fine. I didn't have much guidance because my mother was very religious but I figured it out and didn't get into any permanent trouble. And now I'm almost 50 and here to help!\n\nI never did have a daughter. So, young ladies (all young ladies), you're all my daughter. AMA!", "You just made me have an aha moment. While i never criticize my daughter's looks and always tell her she is beautiful, I actually put myself down quite a bit. I need to stop doing that for her sake.", "My friends mom was super controlling & didn't let her do anything...but somehow she came to school with the worst eyebrows. Everyone made fun of her. They looked like they were done with the jumbo sharpie..not even exaggerating. Poor girl \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f lmao", "As one of my friends says, if it\u2019s not funny then it\u2019s just sad.", "If you can find a way to laugh at your pain, then you've got it made.", "And she said it about *makeup*!  How can the way ones face is colored be sexual? What a great illustration of inappropriate sexualization.\n\nEdit to add: Guess I was talking to a bot\u2026", "Bad Bot Comment stolen from u/tiny-brilliant-2691", "My mom was the same! She called me beautiful ad nauseam, even in my most awkward stages. She would hype up my curves (the ones I desperately tried to hide) and tell me how I had the perfect \u2018figure\u2019 at a time I thought I was \u2018soooo fat\u2019. Now I do the same for my beautiful, smart, and amazing daughter!\n\nEdit: who, might I add, has my same slim waist and bigger hips/bottom!", "Just keep in mind if a creep comes after a 10 year old the clothing isn't what attracted them.\n\nMy mom would do the same (albeit with a lot of judgement that made me feel like a slut for choosing those clothes) but I got attacked at school over and over and my tshirt and jeans didn't stop jackshit.", "That's me. If my girls want it done, I'm taking them to see the lady who does our hair because I'm scared I'd mess their hair up", "I will support and assist my children with any and all weirdness. All day. Of course, I'm 42 and dye my hair a color called \"Charcoal fuchsia\" so what do I know?", "Lol I thought about doing something commemorative for her but I think it would backfire. She's adamant that I've ruined the body that she \"gave\" me and I won't attract a good man", "Omg\ud83e\udd23", "I love your reply!! That last sentence is great.\n\n  I was just relieved i didn't have to feel aggregation at sexy crap. They'll just go behind your back anyway. I remember having a short, very cute peasant dress that was kind of both sided, but one side had a higher neck line. That's the side i wore out of the house, quickly spinning it around to the low side at the first opportunity. Yeah, i got grief over the sexy stuff, but i still found a way. I had no wish to cause my kids to be sneaky."]}
