If not exactly for this exact situation, your actual title. I see you only disclosed in a comment your daughter 16, fair enough she\u2019s definitely not a very young child or anything. However you left your girlfriend, the only true and real adult, alone with your daughter. She didn\u2019t try to tell your daughter she couldn\u2019t go to the party, you had already made that decision and that\u2019s fine. Your girlfriend thought your daughter was presenting herself too provocatively, for whatever reason, and attempted to rectify that. Presumably your girlfriend knows how your daughter normally presents herself, which would be in accordance with whatever you approve of. Your girlfriend clearly saw something else going on there that night, and in your absence tried to correct it, whether in error or not. \n\nMaybe they should\u2019ve called you, maybe your girlfriend should\u2019ve taken a picture and sent it to you.\n\nBut your title is a blanket statement, and a possibly dangerous and assholish one.   If your daughter did something clearly wrong or neglected a chore or insulted your girlfriend, you\u2019re not giving your girlfriend the autonomy and authority to say something about it?", "YTA You can't leave a child with an adult and give the adult no authority. It would be different if you were there.", "YTA\n\nHow can you go away on a trip, expect your GF to look after your Daughter but not parent her in a way? You left her as guardian/responsible adult. As such she is gonna need to parent", "YTA!!!\n\nFirst, you need to understand there are two ways to look at this.  There is the legal side, and there is the moral side.  Your GF, as in loco parentis, has a legal obligation to act as a \\*parent\\* (not step-parent) in the absence of any other parent figure.  In the eyes of the law, if you leave your minor daughter in the care of your girlfriend, your girlfriend has the same legal obligation to ENGAGE as a parent...as if your girlfriend actually was the birth mother.  That's the legal view.  How this works in practice.  Let's say your daughter sneaks out of the house and steals beer from the local supermarket....\n\nAs the adult in charge at the time, your girlfriend could be facing serious legal charges for that, as she failed to properly supervise your daughter, as any mother would.  So to say or even IMPLY that your girlfriend is less of a parent than you are is wrong.  You can only make that argument when you are HOME.  A different situation exists if you are out camping with your buddies.  \n\nFrom the moral perspective...this works pretty much the same.  If you don't expect your girlfriend to engage as a parent (a FULL parent) then morally speaking...you have abandoned your minor daughter by leaving her alone without proper supervision.\n\nSo right off the bat, you are double AH.\n\nNow let's explore the specific situation.  Women of all ages wear way too much makeup.  It's really not appropriate at any age.  But it's especially disturbing to see a minor child do this.  Women, for the most part...will be tolerant of kids experimenting with make-up, even if they overdo it a bit.  That is because the perspective is a bit skewed.  For a person who wears too much make-up, she's less likely to notice or object to another person wearing too much make-up.\n\nMy Point?  If a woman gets upset over a girl dressing \"provocative\" then it's most likely the deal that the way she is dressed and made up is WAY over-the-top...especially for a minor child.  Side speculation...I'm betting your daughter thought she could be sneaky that one night, because she knew that \"dad\" wasn't home.  (GREEN LIGHT to GO WILD!!!)\n\nSpeaking as a father of one boy and one girl...if my girlfriend got all over my daughter for dressing provocatively and I found out about that?  My daughter would be in double trouble.  She'd be punished both for the way she dressed, but also for disrespecting my girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend did nothing wrong, and everything right.  You owe her a huge apology.  And you need to discipline your daughter, also.", "YTA if she\u2019s your girlfriend she automatically has some power to tell you daughter what to do you are very unreasonable", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If GF sees the daughter about to, say, get in the car drunk, is she supposed to just let her because it\u2019s \u201cnot her job to parent\u201d?", ">Any issues - you contact the parent and ask is this allowed and then the parent intervenes if need be. You dont punish someone elses kid.\n\nBut why do you have to be a parent to stop a kid from doing something wrong?", "Your girlfriend is way out of line. Your daughter is old enough to be honest by herself over the weekend. Unless she's doing something dangerous or illegal, your girlfriend should not be stopping in at all. \n\nShe's also ruining any future relationship between her and your daughter, which will likely strain your relationship with your daughter as she gets older. If she's not willing to apologize and work to fix that, I would rethink the relationship altogether.", "Ok, if this is the case.\n\nYou are away, your gf is not to parent in any way. Great.\n\nYour daughter is at a party, her ride leaves her stranded at the party. Does she walk home? Does she call you, away camping?  Because she damn well better not call GF, that would be wrong.\n\nSetting up a horrible situation OP\n\nWTAF - YTA", "You didn\u2019t leave your daughter alone with your girlfriend? I\u2019m confused about what happened here.", "Without knowing her age, I would not have known that.", "If the daughter is about to leave the house with a 45 year old man, the GF should just say \u201cok bye have fun!\u201d? Or if she\u2019s about to get in the car drunk, GF should just ignore it?", "Idk, I was leaning that way but another comment pointed out OP is leaving his kid alone with the gf so there is a level of responsibility expected. The makeup stuff seemed unnecessary but if he\u2019s gonna leave his kid in her care she needs to get some level of input. If something bad had happened that gf could prevent im sure OP would have expected gf to intervene.", "He left. There was no one there calling the shots. A child with no parent and an adult who wasn't allowed to parent. He set them both up to fail.", "The problem was caused by a teenager dressing provocotively.  Was the teenager dressed provocatively when the father left the house?", "Yes. Teachers, childcare workers etc. are acting \"in loco parentis\".", "Okay, well, maybe that's something you and your gf need to talk about. This is all new to her and probably awkward and everything. It's very hard to join in an already established family unit, especially one with a young lady like you have. So, maybe cut her some slack. She's trying. These things can be bumpy for a while (trust me, I lived through it with my own parents' divorce and remarrying situation), but they will smooth out eventually if you guys work on it and try to work through it.", "Did you, your GF, and your daughter have in depth conversations about expectations and what each would be comfortable with before your GF moved in? \n\nDoes your daughter cook for herself when you\u2019re not there? Do her own laundry? Clean up after herself? When you are there, do you and your daughter do all of that?\n\nIs it expected that your GF do anything for your daughter? For example, who cooks dinner? Who cleans the bathrooms? Does your daughter have a curfew? If she stays out after that, should your GF ignore that if you\u2019re not there? \n\nI\u2019m just trying to get a handle on the expectations in your home now that your GF has moved in.", "OK, here we have another problem.  Other people see that your daughter is dressed inappropriately, but you are somehow OK with that?  Then you are part of the problem, dad!", "true. You bring up good points", ">He didn\u2019t leave his daughter with his gf intentionally.\n\nIn that case, he abandoned her...and CPS should get involved.", "Right he sounds like a pervert", "100% this creep is dangerous", "You didn\u2019t answer my question. Should she refuse to pick her up, yes or no?", "Yeah, I get that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same as leaving a 6-year-old with the gf. But if something were to go wrong, gf would still be responsible or be blamed. The makeup shit was stupid, I have no idea why the gf got involved with that. That said, when would she step in as an adult if needed? That is why a deeper convo needs to take place. Say gf saw OP\u2019s kid stashing vodka in her purse for the party, or if she didn\u2019t come home on time? Yeah, she could call OP and say \u201cshe left with vodka just so you know\u201d and I can guarantee OP would say \u201cwtf, you let her do that?\u201d *fixed a few typos*", "Also, I think the spectrum of comments here justifies the overall need, which is a bigger, in-depth conversation.", "The guy said I \"don't want a new step mom for my daughter\". That's seems pretty clear to me. \n\nYour scenario isn't about parenting; that's about not letting another person kill themselves or others. Don't friends keep friends from driving drunk all the time? Is that considered parenting? Gf just moved in a few months ago and is trying to set a precedent of having authority over daughter. This was nothing but a power play. She doesn't have shit.", "Maybe uber home", "Ok but the daughter didn\u2019t walk out of the house with a 45 year old man. She was going to a party dressed how she wished to express herself and was told she couldnt by someone who isnt her parent. Thats over reaching", "And no she doesn\u2019t need some level of input, if she doesn\u2019t like how he parents than she\u2019s free to say no to caring for the child but what she\u2019s not free to do is change what the parent as already established. \nThis is not a partnership, he\u2019s the parent she\u2019s HIS girlfriend she\u2019s not the mother or a motherly role, he established that when they first got to together if she didn\u2019t like it she was free to not continue the relationship", "Yeah level of responsibility is not the same as overriding a parent.", "I was often left alone for days or weeks at 16. obviously with everything I needed to be fine. 16 is more than old enough to watch yourself for a few days. So G/f wasn't necessarily expected to take on the \"in charge\" or parental role.", "He called the shots. He would likely have left his daughter alone. There was no need for the gf to interject.", "No he did not, again he set a precedent for daughter already, she was allowed to go the party, the girlfriend decided she was to parent something that had already had parental involvement it was not and is not her place", "How does one dress provocative?", "No, watching/ supervising a child while parents are gone isn't the same as, say, telling them what they are and are not allowed to eat. If they could act like parents, then they wouldn't need parental permission to do anything.", "Sometimes woman judge other girls / woman more than guys. That length of skirt, the cut of the top, the make up etc and accuse them of being slutty. Thats not OP's daughters hangup or OP's. She doesnt have the right to say that to someone else's daughter and its very backward thinking.", "You are ridiculous. Again you can be a partner WITHOUT being a mommy or daddy. She could say no but most people would not say that because that is an exceptional situation in which you help eachothther out. Helping in times of need without trying to be a parent, what is so hard to understand about that?", "Yeah but you\u2019re just jumping into scenarios that 1) never happened. And 2) has nothing to do with the situation. OP has already established he wasn\u2019t looking for a mother figure. He\u2019s drawn the line at her stepping in as a parent when they first started dating. You\u2019re just putting things in OP\u2019s mouth at this point. At the end of the day, his gf overstepped. She is in the wrong. You don\u2019t even know if his child is the type to behave in such a way. Come on.", "Sure but that doesn\u2019t change the fact his gf overstepped in this situation.", ">This is not a partnership,\n\nThe law disagrees with you.  Look up in loco parentis\n\nIt applies in this situation", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t say that\u2026the level of responsibility is bare minimum when you\u2019re watching a kid. Im saying the makeup stuff was unnecessary but there needs to be established boundaries now that gf is living there and watching the kid when OP is gone. A bit of hyperbole but if the kid decided not to go the party but rather have a party at OP\u2019s house, would the gf just say \u201csure, go ahead, I can\u2019t give input!\u201d *edited for typos*", "It is, in both the legal and moral sense...if the parent isn't around to consult.   Put it in perspective.  Dad is camping.  Unless this was \"glamping\" then he was deliberately out of touch.  It was the girlfriend's call, as the girlfriend (only) caught the girl mis-behaving.", "I\u2019m exploring other scenarios that can happen in the absence of the parental figure. I find that fair to think about. Kids experiment and make poor decisions sometimes, that doesn\u2019t mean their any \u201ctype\u201d of kid, just normal.", "I acknowledged the makeup thing was overstepping. But if they continue to live together that warrants evolved discussion on when to step in and when not to.", "Yeah just looked it up and it does not apply here", "It was not the girlfriends call. \nHow is wearing make up that the girlfriend herself deemed provocative the daughter misbehaving?", "Well to me that doesn\u2019t make sense. Whatever they discuss at the end of the day, his gf is not the parent. They cohabit in the same house together. If Op has a good kid then your scenarios don\u2019t matter. If she doesn\u2019t have OP to reach then hopefully she\u2019d have the gf. You\u2019re saying because OP doesn\u2019t want her as a parent that he shouldn\u2019t expect her to do anything for his daughter right?", "\u201cGood\u201d kids can find themselves in bad scenarios all the time, your brain is not done developing at 16. You\u2019re really putting words in my mouth in an effort to disagree, when we clearly agree on the makeup topic."]}
