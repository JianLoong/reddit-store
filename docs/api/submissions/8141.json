She's your equal, she's the person you chose as a partner, so don't treat her judgment like it doesn't matter.

If not exactly for this exact situation, your actual title. I see you only disclosed in a comment your daughter 16, fair enough she\u2019s definitely not a very young child or anything. However you left your girlfriend, the only true and real adult, alone with your daughter. She didn\u2019t try to tell your daughter she couldn\u2019t go to the party, you had already made that decision and that\u2019s fine. Your girlfriend thought your daughter was presenting herself too provocatively, for whatever reason, and attempted to rectify that. Presumably your girlfriend knows how your daughter normally presents herself, which would be in accordance with whatever you approve of. Your girlfriend clearly saw something else going on there that night, and in your absence tried to correct it, whether in error or not. \n\nMaybe they should\u2019ve called you, maybe your girlfriend should\u2019ve taken a picture and sent it to you.\n\nBut your title is a blanket statement, and a possibly dangerous and assholish one.   If your daughter did something clearly wrong or neglected a chore or insulted your girlfriend, you\u2019re not giving your girlfriend the autonomy and authority to say something about it?", "YTA You can't leave a child with an adult and give the adult no authority. It would be different if you were there.", "YTA\n\nHow can you go away on a trip, expect your GF to look after your Daughter but not parent her in a way? You left her as guardian/responsible adult. As such she is gonna need to parent", "YTA!!!\n\nFirst, you need to understand there are two ways to look at this.  There is the legal side, and there is the moral side.  Your GF, as in loco parentis, has a legal obligation to act as a \\*parent\\* (not step-parent) in the absence of any other parent figure.  In the eyes of the law, if you leave your minor daughter in the care of your girlfriend, your girlfriend has the same legal obligation to ENGAGE as a parent...as if your girlfriend actually was the birth mother.  That's the legal view.  How this works in practice.  Let's say your daughter sneaks out of the house and steals beer from the local supermarket....\n\nAs the adult in charge at the time, your girlfriend could be facing serious legal charges for that, as she failed to properly supervise your daughter, as any mother would.  So to say or even IMPLY that your girlfriend is less of a parent than you are is wrong.  You can only make that argument when you are HOME.  A different situation exists if you are out camping with your buddies.  \n\nFrom the moral perspective...this works pretty much the same.  If you don't expect your girlfriend to engage as a parent (a FULL parent) then morally speaking...you have abandoned your minor daughter by leaving her alone without proper supervision.\n\nSo right off the bat, you are double AH.\n\nNow let's explore the specific situation.  Women of all ages wear way too much makeup.  It's really not appropriate at any age.  But it's especially disturbing to see a minor child do this.  Women, for the most part...will be tolerant of kids experimenting with make-up, even if they overdo it a bit.  That is because the perspective is a bit skewed.  For a person who wears too much make-up, she's less likely to notice or object to another person wearing too much make-up.\n\nMy Point?  If a woman gets upset over a girl dressing \"provocative\" then it's most likely the deal that the way she is dressed and made up is WAY over-the-top...especially for a minor child.  Side speculation...I'm betting your daughter thought she could be sneaky that one night, because she knew that \"dad\" wasn't home.  (GREEN LIGHT to GO WILD!!!)\n\nSpeaking as a father of one boy and one girl...if my girlfriend got all over my daughter for dressing provocatively and I found out about that?  My daughter would be in double trouble.  She'd be punished both for the way she dressed, but also for disrespecting my girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend did nothing wrong, and everything right.  You owe her a huge apology.  And you need to discipline your daughter, also.", "YTA if she\u2019s your girlfriend she automatically has some power to tell you daughter what to do you are very unreasonable", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a result I do feel somewhat responsible for them and I do care about them. \n\nMy stepdaughter is 9. They started wearing makeup to school. I was shocked. 9 seems so young for makeup. But I didn\u2019t call them any type of gendered slur, or otherwise shame them. \n\nI spoke privately with their father and brought it to his attention. He spoke with their bio mom and they both agreed 9 is too young for makeup at school. At sleepovers to play around with it is fine. Wearing it at home for fun on the weekend is fine. But not to school yet. \n\nSo unless the children or someone else are in actual physical danger, I take my concerns to their father who talks with their mom about it, and they reach a decision. \n\nMakeup is not a physical danger situation. If OP was concerned, at 16 you just let the daughter go out for the night. And then separately, privately talk to the father. Now I wouldn\u2019t call makeup \u201cprovocative\u201d but if I felt like my 16 year old stepchild wasn\u2019t wearing makeup well, I\u2019d suggest maybe we go to [Makeup Store] together and get a makeup lesson and buy new products. Of course I\u2019d suggest it to their father first and make sure he was ok with it.

A 16 year old can have a job, drive a car, be alone at home without someone over 18, they can babysit, they can make decisions about themselves. If you are preventing a 16 year old from making their own choices when it comes to their dress, friends, hobbies, etc, I worry about that 16 year olds ability to function in 2 years at 18 when they are often expected to either enter the work force or higher education because they were never given space to make decisions for themselves & see the results of those decisions without parental approval & oversight.", "Nope, girlfriend and daughter were their together because they both LIVE there.

The GF made a judgement call on what she felt was appropriate, and maybe in this instance her call wasn\u2019t right, but bollocking her for it isn\u2019t the way to fix any of the relationships here. Readdress the roles and confirm again what everyone is expecting. \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t move in with a 16 yo who had no respect for me, or my part in their dads life.

I wonder if OP would still be so upset if he had personally seen how his daughter had looked, and whether he would have been happy with her going out that way.

So ita not that weird that he doesn't want her making parental decisions.", "Gf and daughter are basically roommates, they live in the same house and that's ultimately it. While roommates might have shared meals, plans to split chores and similar things, that doesn't mean it has to be so, nor does it make anyone a parent.", "I wish my mom was like that but apparently she prefers her daughters to have crippling self esteem. Thanks mom!", "The pro move is not to say anything about how your kids dress, but take LOTS of pictures!", "My parents let me express myself too and never said anything negative about anything but will joke saying I'm a freak with all my tattoos. My mom dyed my hair dark purple when I was in grade 6 back in the 90's.", "How did OP's daughter throw a fit? I didn't read that, just that the girlfriend forced her to change her makeup before she went to the party.", "My mom just laughed at me and called me a Witch xD but didn't make me change. We still had fun dressing eachother up in our respective styles with our own twist.", "I haven't gotten far enough to see many yet", "Since OP wrote \"one of my mates\" instead of \"one of my friends,\" I suspect he might live in a country other than the USA.", "Girls also get all that without makeup. The guys who bother teenagers aren't confused or tricked.", "I would think that he would react to these hypothetical scenarios the same way he would react if he never met his gf. He doesn\u2019t need another parental figure. He stated it plainly. She is hurting not helping. Gf is in the wrong on several levels. If she was allowed to parent the example of parenting she displayed shows she wouldn\u2019t be a positive influence. NTA", " Well, sounds like you turned out witty.\ud83e\udd23", "Exactly! I had 80\u2019s sprayed hair with bangs a mile high. Mom never said a word, just took a pic.", "I told my kiddo he could get a mullet but I\u2019d print a giant portrait of him with it to hang up in a few years.\n\nWeirdly, he chose not to.", "Ive been dying my 16 year olds (11th grade) hair purple since she left 8th grade. The only real reason I didnt \"let\" her do it before that is that the school didnt allow it.\n\nWhat the hell do I care what color her hair is? Or her makeup, for that matter. Doesnt matter what her hair or makeup looks like, it doesnt change who she is as a person.", "Sounds like my mom, she dyed my hair bright pink and helped me shave the sides so I could have a mohawk. I love my mom!", "My mom's the same. helped me dye my hair from a young age, enabled my crazy styles and hair cuts, but she'll never get over the tattoos. She takes it as a personal offense, like I got them specifically and solely to spite her.", "The US is famously more prudish and supervising of teenagers than other western countries.", "The humour hides the pain.", "That's wicked, mine tried to give me a spiked hair style but she ended up giving me a mullet \ud83e\udd23 now because of that I will never have short hair and it's been waist length for so long lol", "Cool hopefully op goes over this again with his partner \u270c\ud83c\udffe", "Oh lord, the accidental mullet \ud83d\ude02"]}
