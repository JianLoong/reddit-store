She's your equal, she's the person you chose as a partner, so don't treat her judgment like it doesn't matter.

If not exactly for this exact situation, your actual title. I see you only disclosed in a comment your daughter 16, fair enough she\u2019s definitely not a very young child or anything. However you left your girlfriend, the only true and real adult, alone with your daughter. She didn\u2019t try to tell your daughter she couldn\u2019t go to the party, you had already made that decision and that\u2019s fine. Your girlfriend thought your daughter was presenting herself too provocatively, for whatever reason, and attempted to rectify that. Presumably your girlfriend knows how your daughter normally presents herself, which would be in accordance with whatever you approve of. Your girlfriend clearly saw something else going on there that night, and in your absence tried to correct it, whether in error or not. \n\nMaybe they should\u2019ve called you, maybe your girlfriend should\u2019ve taken a picture and sent it to you.\n\nBut your title is a blanket statement, and a possibly dangerous and assholish one.   If your daughter did something clearly wrong or neglected a chore or insulted your girlfriend, you\u2019re not giving your girlfriend the autonomy and authority to say something about it?", "YTA You can't leave a child with an adult and give the adult no authority. It would be different if you were there.", "YTA\n\nHow can you go away on a trip, expect your GF to look after your Daughter but not parent her in a way? You left her as guardian/responsible adult. As such she is gonna need to parent", "YTA!!!\n\nFirst, you need to understand there are two ways to look at this.  There is the legal side, and there is the moral side.  Your GF, as in loco parentis, has a legal obligation to act as a \\*parent\\* (not step-parent) in the absence of any other parent figure.  In the eyes of the law, if you leave your minor daughter in the care of your girlfriend, your girlfriend has the same legal obligation to ENGAGE as a parent...as if your girlfriend actually was the birth mother.  That's the legal view.  How this works in practice.  Let's say your daughter sneaks out of the house and steals beer from the local supermarket....\n\nAs the adult in charge at the time, your girlfriend could be facing serious legal charges for that, as she failed to properly supervise your daughter, as any mother would.  So to say or even IMPLY that your girlfriend is less of a parent than you are is wrong.  You can only make that argument when you are HOME.  A different situation exists if you are out camping with your buddies.  \n\nFrom the moral perspective...this works pretty much the same.  If you don't expect your girlfriend to engage as a parent (a FULL parent) then morally speaking...you have abandoned your minor daughter by leaving her alone without proper supervision.\n\nSo right off the bat, you are double AH.\n\nNow let's explore the specific situation.  Women of all ages wear way too much makeup.  It's really not appropriate at any age.  But it's especially disturbing to see a minor child do this.  Women, for the most part...will be tolerant of kids experimenting with make-up, even if they overdo it a bit.  That is because the perspective is a bit skewed.  For a person who wears too much make-up, she's less likely to notice or object to another person wearing too much make-up.\n\nMy Point?  If a woman gets upset over a girl dressing \"provocative\" then it's most likely the deal that the way she is dressed and made up is WAY over-the-top...especially for a minor child.  Side speculation...I'm betting your daughter thought she could be sneaky that one night, because she knew that \"dad\" wasn't home.  (GREEN LIGHT to GO WILD!!!)\n\nSpeaking as a father of one boy and one girl...if my girlfriend got all over my daughter for dressing provocatively and I found out about that?  My daughter would be in double trouble.  She'd be punished both for the way she dressed, but also for disrespecting my girlfriend.\n\nYour girlfriend did nothing wrong, and everything right.  You owe her a huge apology.  And you need to discipline your daughter, also.", "YTA if she\u2019s your girlfriend she automatically has some power to tell you daughter what to do you are very unreasonable", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As a result I do feel somewhat responsible for them and I do care about them. \n\nMy stepdaughter is 9. They started wearing makeup to school. I was shocked. 9 seems so young for makeup. But I didn\u2019t call them any type of gendered slur, or otherwise shame them. \n\nI spoke privately with their father and brought it to his attention. He spoke with their bio mom and they both agreed 9 is too young for makeup at school. At sleepovers to play around with it is fine. Wearing it at home for fun on the weekend is fine. But not to school yet. \n\nSo unless the children or someone else are in actual physical danger, I take my concerns to their father who talks with their mom about it, and they reach a decision. \n\nMakeup is not a physical danger situation. If OP was concerned, at 16 you just let the daughter go out for the night. And then separately, privately talk to the father. Now I wouldn\u2019t call makeup \u201cprovocative\u201d but if I felt like my 16 year old stepchild wasn\u2019t wearing makeup well, I\u2019d suggest maybe we go to [Makeup Store] together and get a makeup lesson and buy new products.

It is incredibly hurtful to feel that you have absolutely no input in raising a child that you live with. Let's look at another scenario where your daughter wanted to snort coke and have an orgy and your girlfriend did not stop her- you would be angry and have every right to be. Yes, this is extreme, but equally possible. NTA- but better communication and well established expectations are needed so your girlfriend knows what is expected.

A 16 yr-old is not an adult and while your gf was wrong to intervene in this situation it is possible a situation will come up where your gf needs to be the adult and tell your daughter no but she won\u2019t be able to. I think you need to have a talk about what would be an appropriate situation to intervene in (cause there aren\u2019t going to be many). Like if you say daughter can go to a party but must be home by midnight and daughter says she\u2019s spending the night gf needs to feel empowered enough to at least be able to say, \u201cThat\u2019s not what your dad agreed to we need to ask him first\u201d.

If you would leave your 16-year-old home to care for herself for a weekend, then your girlfriend shouldn't be able to say anything to her. However, if you're leaving your 16-year-old home with your girlfriend to care for her through the weekend, then you are leaving her in the position of a guardian and it's quite reasonable for her to act as such.", "I'm interested to know how your GF responded to what's been said. Could your daughter be over stating or misunderstanding the conversation? Could your GF simply have said something like \"that makeup is a bit much, are you sure about it?\" (Still the wrong thing but not a demand to change it) and your daughter took it the wrong way? What is their general relationship like? Does your daughter like your girlfriend? I guess what I'm getting at is could this be a total misunderstanding between two people who are finding their way in a complex relationship? I'm a grown ass adult and still found it difficult to adjust when my dad settled with his GF, who I love now but did feel uncomfortable with for the first few years.\n\nAbsolutely a 16 year old still needs parenting but you've made it clear to your GF that she is not parenting your daughter so assuming that your daughter is repeating accurately what was said between them (not an accusation just speaking as a mum and a stepmum and a daughter and knowing humans are brilliant at misunderstanding stuff) then NTA. Your GF overstepped and needs to back off. \n\nHowever if your plan is to continue a relationship with your GF then you need to sit down and have a civil adult conversation with them both.

She didn't stop her from going out anything like that, she did something that looks to me like an act of care.

I've analysed the crap out of this... in response to another comment....\n\n>So when you hire babysitter or get a friend to babysit - you dont pass PARENTAL AUTHORITY over. They dont become the kids parent. Any issues - you contact the parent and ask is this allowed and then the parent intervenes if need be. You dont punish someone elses kid.\n\nYour post has actually helped me clarify the issue in my head a bit....\nSo when you hire a baby sitter, you don't hand over PARENTAL authority over, no. But you do hand over to some extent LEGAL and ETHICAL authority.\n\nI think this is where people are arguing. Because asking a teen to change make up is seen as a more parental duty. So yes, I think we can all agree that the gf stepped into parent duties without permission.\n\nHowever OP seems to indicate that ANY type of direction or advice given from the gf to the daughter is not cool. So it would be difficult in the case of living with a minor if you had to intervene for moral or ethical reasons.\n\nNow, OP says that he wants his gf just like that, not as a babysitter. So that should release the gf to not bother about the daughter at all.\n\nHOWEVER, hands up who did stupid/risky stuff when they were a teen? Or a parent that has a teen? We all know that sometimes adults need to step in and save them from themselves and gently explain/put boundaries in place. So by the OPs post, HE is the only one that can do that. So what happens when he leaves for the weekend? Who is monitoring this lovely young girl? OP doesn't seem to be. We have no information on how mature this 16yo girl actually is. Maybe she is trustworthy to a T. Maybe she is not, all the time, and OP is being neglectful. We simply do not know.\n\nIt would be hard, for a strong moral and ethical person to sit back and watch a teen nose dive without saying anything to them while their parent is away. I feel for the gf. But.. the gf might have control issues and be a bit of a irritant. Once again we do not know.\n\nThere needs to be communication between them. When is it ok to step in, and not ok, ethically?\n\nAnd the point about babysitters calling parents when something happens..... yes that happens with big things. Not every, little, tiny thing. I've baby sat for 20 years. Do the parents trying to have a night off want me to blow up their phone every time a child says they don't like peas for dinner, refuses to go to bed, grizzles about wanting more tv or annoyed at being told off for pinching his sister? No. Parents want to feel comfortable that they are safe and secure in your care. What if a kid picked up a knife at the dinner table, and was about to ram it in the toddlers eye for fun? Do the parents want me to call them up and chat about it, or do they want me to intervene immediately to reduce harm? \n\nSame with this situation. If the teen was acting erratically, would OP then want the gf to act and intervene quickly? Obviously not the make up situation. But that time will come, and the gf will feel torn. That is why they need to talk about it. OP also said he went camping. What if he is somewhere where there is no reception. OP would have felt irritated when he arrived home, and that would have been stressful. He obviously sounds angry. After a cool down, a talk about what made the gf make the makeup comment would be useful. And next time, what should happen.\n\nMy opinion, if you put people like this in a house together, a natural family dynamic forms. If you don't want a family, and a family dynamic, break it. The gf shouldn't be living with them. And OP seems to have deep seated issues surrounding the mothering of his daughter, coming out in how he talks (as it seems the actually mother has sadly passed).Is there something going on emotionally for him that he needs to address? I think individual therapy for him, and family therapy for all of them if they want to keep living this way.", "So if your daughter went out and got in shit or something happened to her because your gf isn\u2019t allowed to intervene what would your reaction be? \n\nDo you trust your gf who I assume is of legal age around your age (35-45) to provide guidance and direction to your daughter that best sets her up for success? \n\nFor your gf, do you guys have the same values in raising children etc?

I would say you\u2019re bringing this person into your life\u2026 that\u2019s your entire life, you want her to care for your daughter and take some responsibility in their safety and uprising which means she should have some level of say to protect her.

What should she do if your daughter's school calls with an issue and you're not available? I don't have kids so honestly I'm sure there are a million possible situations that I would never think of but you really need to talk through these kinds of things.\n\n\"Don't tell my daughter she can't do something I already approved\" is a reasonable boundary to set. But \"you will never have any sort of parental responsibility\" is just not very realistic.\n\nThis is a hard line to walk! It will require a lot of communication between the three of you, and some flexibility to maybe revise as new issues and conflicts come up in the future. If you all go into it in good faith and willing to forgive each other's miststeps that will make it a lot easier.", "Yeah, seriously if its not black/yellow/brown face, it's just makeup. GF should have only intervened if the makeup was wildly inappropriate (to the point of being canceled) and should have called dad first. GF messed up.", "Agreed. I think this term is only appropriate regarding makeup if, for example, the makeup is racist such as black face or yellow face. Or a swastika painted on their forehead. That IS provocative and totally inappropriate. But otherwise, not a word I would use. Overly heavy? Maybe. Wrong color for skin tone? Sure. But provocative? No.", "I really can't understand how makeup can be provocative??? Did she draw dicks all over lol", "Absolutely. While she isn\u2019t a mother to her, she is a female role model and this is not how women should treat each other.", "Yep. My teen is really into anime and lives the short pleated skirts along with some cosplay that\u2019s going to grab unwanted attention. \n\nThe only thing I comment on is safety. Hey: don\u2019t forget your mace. Do you have a plan to deal with creepers? \n\nShe\u2019s 19 now but I still do the safety drills when she leaves for a cosplay event.", "I don't think age matters that much? OP isn't asking for judgement on leaving his daughter with the GF, not on letting her go to a party. I don't see anything else that could make him an asshole if the daughter was younger.", "Completely agree. And my mother did exactly that. I was allowed to play with makeup at home from a young age. When I was 14 she took me to Clinique to learn how to choose colors and apply properly in order to begin wearing it to school.", "Yes!! This is how I've handled things with my stepdaughter over the past 15yrs. Never had any drama because of it. If her bio parents are fine with it - who am I to say otherwise?", "Step-parent here as well. \n\nGranted, the boys are a lot younger... but I just wanted to second that feeling of feeling responsible for them.  I mean, I think with the ages of my boys, it was never a question that I'd be taking on that role.. but I'd question the personality of someone who could live in a house with a child and be okay with just being around and not taking on any of that role", "I really agree with this", "I wish my kids' fathers (my kids are 6 years apart) would've married women like you. For real. You handled that so well. Exactly how that should be handled. In my situation, the stepmoms have made my kids miserable and one even psychologically abused my child (she's now an ex-stepmom). I don't think any of that would've happened if they would've handled things like you've described. \n\nI can see dad's side of not wanting the girlfriend to parent his daughter also, though. My daughter is 17. Even at 16, if I were dating someone, I would ask him not to tell her what to do unless she asks him for advice. But she has a REALLY good head on her shoulders and rarely gets into trouble. I've been both helping her to and allowing her her to steadily gain more independence since the age of 16 so that when she becomes an adult and goes off on her own, she isn't like a fish out of water.  So even I'm doing less parenting of my daughter that age. If she were younger, though, like age 9, I think it would be reasonable for the stepmom (or a boyfriend in my case) to take on more of a caregiver role when necessary. And if they'd handle things the way you did, coming to me first for things like this, well that would just be amazing.", "You gave me an amazing idea for my two girls, youngest isn\u2019t into makeup like someone her sisters age, but for my oldest (11years old), definitely will take her to look at make up and learn some techniques at a make up store or counter. That\u2019s if and when she is really interested it/asks me about it. :) I agree with everything you said before and after!", "Me too! I would put way too much eye liner on and then vigorously rub it. I thought I looked fantastic, but... I didn't. My mom didn't say a word, she just let me express myself and I'm really happy about that now.

And let\u2019s not forget the hair!", "If there are 25 year olds at a party for 16 year olds, don\u2019t you think that constitutes an issue entirely independent of what kind of makeup this girl is wearing? You\u2019re on a slippery slope bud. Makeup and clothing is never the cause of an unwanted sexual advance.", "Not the gf\u2019s business. Not the gf\u2019s place to try to make it out to be the daughter\u2019s responsibility how a man would look at her makeup. \n\nMen need to control themselves. If they can\u2019t then they shouldn\u2019t leave their mother\u2019s basement.", "The GF is for sure wrong, but it's no where near as grevious as your trying to make it sound.  This sub has a problem with being overly dramatic.\n\nI mean, adults in adult relationships that work, understand these minor altercations happen from time to time, and are able to handle these in calm situations.\n\nIt's not \"slut shamming\" when dealing with litteral children.  Stop throwing your buzzwords around, they don't make a point for you.", "That would provoke somerhing, for sure!", "If provocative in the gfs comment meant slutty... I don't know if drawn tits are that lol\n\nThen again I don't totally grasp the idea behind provocative makeup at all. All kinds of glam looks are so mainstream nowadays that you really can't relate makeup look to anyone's morals, character or... Anything. Other than the fact that they most likely like makeup.", "lol this is the age gap between my youngest brother and I. She needs to step back or move out. She crossed an important boundary. Maybe put off the move until daughter leaves the house?

I read it, and I am specifically saying it's unrealistic for him to expect an adult cohabitating with a minor to hold zero authority over said minor, so instead there should be a conversation about rules, boundaries what should and shouldn't be situations for her to step in on. Like it or not, if there's a minor in the home there will be times where an adult may need to step in. \n\nI by no means am a parent to my sisters' kids but when we've lived together I absolutely had the authority to correct them, within the bounds that we the adults discussed. Had their been no authority then any time their parents weren't around it would have been a few for all which isn't realistic.", "That seems incredibly reasonable pop. Keep being a good dad.", "Sounds like the daughter complied with the idiot girlfriend's request, then brought the issue to her actual parent. What's disrespectful about that?", "I am also confused by this comment lol", "Me too. I think gf\u2019s comments are unwarranted but 16 years old is still a minor, the daughter needs some kind of guardian at least while dad is away. Not saying gf should be dictating her makeup and looks but a 16 year old should have someone looking out for them in the case of emergency, at the bare minimum.", "I mean, it's just coloured grease. \n\nAll the \"bad men are gonna get you\" is just victim-blaming and smug self-congratulation.", "Lol \u2026 \u201cI compliment it, or not, as the spirit moves me.\u201d \n\nAs a mom of a teenager, this cracked me up\u2026 because SAME! Haha! You really have to walk on eggshells when you compliment a teenage girl! Sometimes it\u2019s just best to not say anything at all!", "I'm over here confused on how her makeup was considered provocative? Did she have \"FUCK U\" written in eyeliner on her forehead or something?", "Exactly! She was def wrong, but I think the response as well as OP\u2019s comments indicate that there may be some lack of clearly stating expectations.", "If the daughter comes home drunk, she comes home drunk and dad will deal with her later. School wouldn't never call GF if dad doesn't specifically add her to a list. If daughter calls for a ride because she's intoxicated or her ride was, she's likely going to call dad, because GF is not a step mom. If she calls GF its because she sees her as equal or respects her enough to help. I'm also assuming that dad was never out of contact, otherwise he'd say so and lay down rules for how things work with GF. GF was specifically told not to interfere with a certain situation that was already approved. GF interfered anyways.

Not saying gf was justified at ALL!", "Eh, if the daughter was trying to leave the house wearing very heavy makeup at, say, age 9, I could see  intervening.  \"Provocative\" is not a word I would ever use to describe one's makeup, but I don't think it's age appropriate for young children to wear makeup that makes them look like mature teens or adults. As it stands though, the GF is definitely the asshole.", "Expecting that an adult living in the same household as a minor will not provide any kind of input whatsoever into the minor\u2019s life is kind of an AH move.", "Exactly what my mom did. Now when my SD is old enough we will offer to pay for it and offer bio mom the opportunity to take SD first. If she doesn\u2019t want to, then I will. But I think SD\u2019s bio mom should get the opportunity if she wants it.", "I did similarly with my daughter. She's been allowed to play with makeup looks at home since she's been able to apply it but I made her wash it off before leaving the house when she was younger. When she turned 14, I started allowing light makeup like mascara to school or in public, and then it progressed from there as she got older, and now she's 17 and most of her Christmas presents were quality makeup pallets in all kinds of colors and brushes, etc. She's better at applying different eyeshadow looks than I am at this point and I'm really proud of her for it because it's so dang artistic.", "Yeah, I usually privately give my husband my thoughts and then it\u2019s for him and mom to decide. I can\u2019t imagine I would ever put my foot down unless I truly felt the kids were unsafe somehow. But if he was letting his kids do objectively unsafe things, I wouldn\u2019t be with him. So I doubt this scenario will ever come up. \n\nSo at the end of the day, sure, they let the kids do some things before I probably would if I was the decision maker, but nothing unsafe or harmful, so who am I to try to undermine that?", "God forbid a lady at marriageable age shows off her assets!

The girlfriend is close with OP, but she's explicitly _not_ a stepmom or parental figure to the daughter, so I think roommate is the best descriptor.\n\n_Parenting_ is a different story.  There's no need for the girlfriend to, for example, make the daughter do her homework. No basis for the girlfriend to ground her for breaking curfew. No basis for, as in the story, putting restrictions on what clothing and makeup she can wear.  That's not roommate territory. At most, she could inform OP of any concerns, but it's up to OP whether he wants to act on them.\n\nObviously in general, adults have a duty to step in if a kid is in danger or up to something especially bad.

If you love this GF then be the adult and try to resolve the situation. \n\nYour GF sounds like she was trying to look out for your daughter, but if she isn\u2019t already a parent she might not really know what to do.

You should've just had a conversation where you said she must rather not do that in the future again. Don't let it get to a huge fight.\n\nAlso, even if you don't like it, try to make your daughter understand that she probably meant well, even though it didn't come across that way. You really don't want to have a situation that's pinning your girlfriend and daughter against each other. So don't blatantly choose sides, as this can cause feelings of resentment between the two of them.

Not defending her but she may have interpreted OPs ban as being too broad to be talked literally? \n\nBut I\u2019m going with NTA because in these circumstances GF is definitely the AH.

Passed away a year ago ): sorry to hear about your dad and glad you had him to help negate her bullshit", "I have 20+ tattoos and no ragrets. 14 is definitely too young though, where are you even legally getting a tattoo at that age?", "You are NTA in this particular situation but it isn\u2019t fair or practical for your gf to have no say when you are away for days at a time. You need to have a frank discussion going over areas that are and aren\u2019t acceptable or you may end up with your daughter inviting people for sleepovers without your gf consent or disappearing for the weekend. And what about if there is an accident or something that is unsafe? A full discussion is needed.", "If daughter starts doing drugs and driving drunk, OP should stop traveling.

My daughter had a \"unique\" fashion sense growing up. When we were shopping, I tried to suggest clothing options that she rolled her eyes at. We bought the things she wanted and went on with life. Now, when she sees pictures from those times, she asks why I let her wear them. Mama tried is all I can say.", "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.

Other than that go crazy", "My mom is the same way. I now have 8 tattoos (but looking into having a couple removed, because they were honestly really sloppy). She hates my nose ring too. I got it at 31, after wanting it since I was 14. My pink hair? No problem. Shaving one side of my head (after a video game character was released)? Not thrilled, but said it looked good. She takes the tattoos and nose ring as something personal. I am still amused by this.", "Thanks so much! I\u2019m going to check it out", "Cant tell if her lack of participation is a good thing or a bad thing, LOL. \n\nShe asked me to help her so I did. Now I just do it whenever she asks. Its kind of a nice bonding time, if I am honest. Captive audience and all that.", "lol, FAIR!
