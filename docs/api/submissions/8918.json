She said, excuse me, don't cut me off. He said, your a tourist, I don't live here either, I'm just helping family over break, lets speak english get this done faster. She said how do you know I'm a tourist what if my parents immigrated here and I just prefer to speak english, what if I just have light skin also am I not supposed to speak the language of this country to it's people instead of english, isn't that respectful? He said, I know your a tourist because I heard you speaking very american english, your recording, and lets say you were born here, you wouldn't come into an incredibly visibly Tamil store and start speaking Sinhalese, and refer to it as the language of this country. She got mad and left the store.\n\nThen when she came back she showed us the video tried to paint it like this kid was some kinda racist, and assuming her race, and treating her different cause she looked East-Asian and that she was a victim of some horrible racist act. And I told her, that she wasn't a victim of racism and that the guy most likely didn't want to deal with annoying tourists. My family treated this like it was some big deal and as if I was being a horrible rude person.\n\nThey got engaged recently and we went to go congratulate them and my SIL expected some kind of apology bc she truly believed I was calling her racist experience fake.
