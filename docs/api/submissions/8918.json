People feeling distressed, justified or not, won\u2019t be able to talk with you like it\u2019s an objective happening in the news etc. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve experienced what she experienced - having lived abroad. It\u2019s sort of racism people do/**reverse culture shock** is what she would experience\u2026in this case he was truly observant and right. She was speaking the wrong language to him, he switched. She\u2019s offended he called her a tourist, but he\u2019s right that locals wouldn\u2019t pull a camera out. Outside the US/Europe (connected regions I\u2019d guess\u2026idk the whole world) most people don\u2019t record others freely, shops even restrict it in some places. I see where you\u2019re coming from, but her issue is being called a tourist and trying to make a progressive statement where that is not the social cause. She\u2019s clearly very western, I grew up around Sri Lankan, Indian, etc. classmates abroad a lot, you can see differences of western/heritage based beliefs and behaviours. Accents etc. \n\nShe should read more on **bi-culturalism** and better understand the dynamics around being a **third culture kid**. She\u2019s applying the wrong social constructs to herself. What she experienced is not the same as American racism issues, it\u2019s more in line with biculturalism and third culture kid contexts. And the country she was in doesn\u2019t work in that construct.\n\nHaving lived through her experience in my own country, I can say the best response is learn more of your country if you want to be accepted as a local. That includes norms like no video. And knowing our ethnic cultures often work off hospitality and community, we accommodate foreigners by adapting to them. It\u2019s not seen as an offense to her otherness, it\u2019s a courtesy of adapting to the guest. I grew up abroad but my family life centred a lot on not losing our culture and I went home a lot. Many foreign residents I met know a lot less and stick out way more when they go back. I still stick out but the fact I know the norms 30+ years later saved me - I didn\u2019t when I was younger and learned from these experiences. Eventually you can accept you\u2019re a mishmash in a homogenous package (racially). I\u2019m fully from my home country, heritage and passport, but having lived most of my life amongst diversity and abroad it changes how you see and interact with the world. Once she learns about it, it may help her reconcile all this and accept herself as is. People always respond from their perception, in this case she perceived the interaction wrong because she\u2019s applying foreign constructs to a local situation. Further proving she\u2019s not heard the phrase \u2018think global, act local\u2019 - local is sometimes very many different tribes etc depending where you go. Their social problems are not at all the same like the US. \n\nGood luck - and don\u2019t comment on things you don\u2019t know. **Dunning-Kruger effect** if you want a framework to google (I made those in bold). You wouldn\u2019t have known what her experience meant, same way she didn\u2019t. Doesn\u2019t mean you dismiss her experience and needs - and that\u2019s true for anyone you meet - just be kind.

They did not classfy jews as white. And historically, jews are not white, the folk stems from Abram, whose family (according to records) came from Mesopotamia. Or from David and Salomo, located in Jerusalem. And racism and antisemitism still are, tho related, different things. And the race theory is long abandoned, nowadays you speak of antisemitism, not racism, when talking about jews and jewish people, as atisemitism is against all who practice or come from practicing families, not based on a \"race\".", "For that you need context. \n\nBut its stereotypisation for sure. He stereotypes and sexualizes white women. Also sexism, if he talks about women as sex objects and sluts. And predatory sounding, looking for a girl (=very young). Maybe fetishization (Fetischisierung) of white \"girls\".\n\nStereotypes can be racist. I am not gonna write an whole article about it. But no, he is not racist with saying that (tho sexist and has prejudices and red flags all over) and saying it the other way round CAN be racist but does not necessarly need to be. But taking the history in count it is not unlikely to be racist if someone wishes for an east asian girl.", "This is referring to colorism, not racism.", "Yeah that I knew. Its most probably (I would say for sure but then peopel would argue me again) left by colonizers who implied a western beauty standard.", "All of it isn't racism, because all of them except the last point have nothing to do with racism whatsoever.", "Critical Race Theory comes from America, again a nation obsessed with race, and it's early pioneers were a mix of races. The most famous guy was black. What's your point?", "I think she meant that as people have the right to discriminate against white people. Which of course im against", "On the day to day it's prejudice. White folks don't even want to admit to white privilege and unpack their backpacks.", "The colour thing, actually predates European colonisation, and not just in South Asia, but also the Middle East and Africa.\n\nAlthough the colour thing is complicated and it's beliefs. There is a reason why throughout the world Albinos are seen as a sign of good fortune and paradoxically were used  as ingredients in voodoo/ black magic", "And what does ethnicity have to do with \"race\"? There are no human \"races\". Its a sociological construct \"white\" people made up to oppress and exploit asian, african, polynesian, native american, native australian etc people while telling themselves that its natural and their right as they are above them. And that thinking still is prominent in many people. Nazis used \"caucasian\" and defines jews as an own race to opress and exploit people. Surprise, they killed black and asian people,  tho by definition some of them were caucasian too. Its been used by \"whites\" to justify hate and violence. It has been deeply installed in \"white\" countries.", "You misunderstoos. I talked of Race theory. Europeans saying \"there are human races. We are the best. Africans are mere animals without soul so it is justified if we opress and exploit them. Asians are okay ish. Natives american are also weak and unworthy.\".", "You're dealing with an actual racist, why are you expecting logic?", "Albinos also were seen as a bad symbol in many cultures. I watched a documentation about saving albinos in an african land bc the parents oftentimes want to kill them. In some culture it may have been but \"the lighter the better\" has not been a global shared experience before westeners started to colonize and used race theory.", "I am so confused by your statement.\n\nThis is what you said:\n\n>Discrimination based on ethnicity is not racism. \n\nBut that is literally the definition of racism.\n\n>*noun*\r  \na belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human racial groups determine cultural or individual achievement, usually involving the idea that one's own race is superior and has the right to dominate others or that a particular racial group is inferior to the others.\n\nThis is from [dictionary.com](https://dictionary.com)\n\nAnd to elaborate:\n\n>If white discriminate poor white people its not racism.\n\nYes, because white people discriminating poor white people is not discrimination against ethnicity, but rather by wealth. Which makes your first statement void.\n\n>If norwegians discriminate germans its not racism.\n\nIt is. Because they are discriminating Germans based on ethnicity.\n\n> Racism is without any knowledge, just by looking at a person, doesnt even need clothes or hairstyles or anything. Just because the features are different from the white \"ideal\".\n\nThat is one *example* of racism, but any other ethnicity other than Caucasian can fully be racist, aka: Discriminating against one due to ethnicity.", "It's because if they can't have everything (including racism) they throw an absolute fit. \n\nNot everything is for everyone. And that includes being racist to white people. It doesn't happen because they are the top of the power dynamic around the entire Earth. Discrimination, sure. Racism? Lmfao."]}
