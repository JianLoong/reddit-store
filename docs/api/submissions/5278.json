Yet you're upset that he didn't pay for you to continue school? If it's your dream school you should of worked for it. I've met undergrads who work while going to school, some at the school itself.

Think about it. He brags about you. Keeps pushing you to chase your dreams by your own hands. If anything, he's showing you how to survive without him now, rather than later.

Certainly you aren't entitled to a free wedding. However, this should be applied equally.  Hence the question. There aren't many but I can envision a few situations where it might be reasonable not to have sent you to the same school eg if you had behavioral problems at school which had meant they wouldn't admit, if it was offered but you didn't want to attend or if your brother had disabilities and your father was only sending them because the public system didn't supply the support they needed. \n\nIf there is a good reason for why this occured then I don't think you can say that you have an entitlement to a similar amount of money being spent on you for grad school.

I turned down better places for the money. My choice was the only way I could pursue this profession at all.

It\u2019s just about making him look good to others. \n\nKeep building your own life with your SO, elope and do maybe a vow renewal a few years down the line, if a wedding is important to you. Or do a low budget thing where you can bring your own food and drinks and everyone contributes one dish or something similar. I\u2019ve been to weddings like that and they were a blast. \n\nAt the end of the day your father has continually hurt you and will most likely keep doing so. Even if it\u2019s hard at first, cutting out toxicity from our lives can be very liberating.", "NTA, don't go to his wedding neither invite him to yours, If this doesn't make him understand what he is doing then he is a lost cause", "I\u2019m petty as hell. I\u2019d plan a bare bones wedding (simple dress, just appetizers, etc) and invite all the family and family friends. And do it sometime after his wedding.", "NTA.", " NTA, for the simple reason that your father doesn\u2019t sound like a good father.", "Do we have the same dad? NTA, let him bury himself.", "You should consider no contact because all your dad will do, and has been doing all your life, is disappoint you and not put any effort towards you. He\u2019s fine with doing that for your brothers and his fianc\u00e9e, but not for you. And I wouldn\u2019t even bother to attend his wedding either.", "Personally, I would only attend since they are in the same profession. They are having a swanky wedding and likely inviting some business associates, which is a perfect time to network. Poach his clients!", "I think this is his best possible gloss and likely how he sees himself. \n\nI don\u2019t feel entitled to his money, I just feel entitled to equal treatment to my brothers. I wanted the money he gave them for high school for grad school. That was all I asked for. I thought because he made this big show about grad school that he\u2019d chip in for the wedding. I think his decision not to pay for the weddings shows his grad school decision was not \u201cpull yourself up by the bootstraps and learn to work for it,\u201d it was pure selfishness. I\u2019m not learning anything by not having a wedding, other than my dads an asshole and I don\u2019t want him in my life. We\u2019ll elope in April.", "According to my father, \u201cI was always going to be fine,\u201d so I didn\u2019t need private school. I had no behavioral problems. He thought the boys \u201cneeded more structure.\u201d Really, I think he just thought they were more worthy of the investment. \n\nOne of my brothers went to the same undergraduate college that I did, but his college preparation at the school allowed him to get into a competitive business honors program and he did insanely well because of excellent study habits, which were engrained by the school. The private school also allowed them to retake courses they didn\u2019t get As in. \ud83e\udee0He is now in private equity in NYC and makes over 300,000 a year as a 26 year old. He simply doesn\u2019t need grad school. \n\nThe other brother has had a failure to launch post-this fancy school. He dropped out of college after lying about failing every course and lives with my mother because the pressure from my dad is unbearable. He was 13 when my parents got divorced, the only one still in the house. I feel bad for him. \n\nMy high school was more \u201cit\u2019s 2008 and there are 50 kids in a class, maybe a teacher will show up,\u201d so I didn\u2019t have good study habits but still had good grades. In college, I took study skills courses and figured out how to do well my second year. I always thought I\u2019d I could\u2019ve done insanely well with more attention. I thought if I got into the same college as brother one with my relatively poor education, I probably could have gotten in somewhere much better with similar resources. My dad didn\u2019t even allow me to apply to private high schools.", "Ooooo, that\u2019s good.", "I\u2019m sorry your father sucks. Friends of ours eloped during Covid. On their one year anniversary they had a vow renewal and a reception. They invited everybody who would have gone to their wedding.", "Yeh. I think cutting him off is for the best.", "If you read what she said she did go to cheaper schools. Grad school is fucking expensive as hell", "Imagine the weight lifted off your shoulders when you never have to see him again, no more let downs, no more tears. It's hard but this man is not worthy of your love", "NTA. Don't attend and go NC. He is horrible. But also, postpone your wedding until you can afford something you want. You don't need to get married soon, you already have what matters.", "NTA. Here's what you do. \n\nBefore the wedding: \n\n- subtly get a DNA sample from your dad and have it tested to prove paternity \n\n- ask your brothers (over text/email, it has to be in writing) for confirmation that they have no student debt. Screenshot their replies.\n\n- ask your dad again, in writing, about why he didn't/won't support you financially like he has for your brothers. Screen shot the conversation. \n\n- message the new fianc\u00e9 asking her to back you up with your father. Screenshot her inevitable shitty response.\n\n- print 200+ copies of an adorable pocket-sized book with the DNA results and all of the screenshots\n\n\n\nThe day of:\n\n- Go to the wedding\n\n- Wear a wedding dress \n\n- Invite your friends. In fact, have your bridesmaids wear the same dresses as his wife's bridesmaids. \n\n- Hijack the expensive wedding\n\n- hand out the \"Why Is My Dad A Dick?\" book to all of the guests as a wedding favour. \n\n\nHe's already cut you off financially and seems to have the emotional capacity of a boiled turnip so you really don't have much to lose.", "NTA - it's your choice if you do not want to go to the wedding. It almost sounds like the soon-to-be wife doesn't like you and that's why she's pretty much telling him what to do with his money. And although traditionally it is the wife's parents who pay for the wedding, I thought I had read somewhere that once you are a certain age it's really not tradition for them to pay for it. At least that's what my mom told me but she might have just done that because she didn't want to pay for my sister's wedding haha, we are both in our 40s", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t speak to him again.", "NTA however, I'm shocked that you are still asking for money from him after all that horrible treatment from childhood until college, honestly just get a court wedding and then plan a big weeding when you and your fiance have paid all your debts and are financially in  good standing, stop asking your dad for money, cause he doesn't want to give you any, don't be a sucker for punishment. I honestly would have cut him off during gradschool, let his wife and favourite sons look after him in his old age", "NTA. Things will get better. You and your husband are young. Look ahead. Your dad is not important", "NTA\n\nCut contact. It willbe worth it in the long run. Your mental and emotional wellbeing will be so much better.", "NTA because there's clearly unequal treatment. Sending kids to different schools is a wtf move. Cutting off one but refusing to do another is also a wtf move. He seems to show affection through money and has chosen to point that towards your brother's.\n\nHowever, you are also not completely dependent on your father. You have zero consequences for not attending. Your situation was not made easier by your father, who could have done so, but he has zero say or input and doesn't seem to have fostered an emotional relationship to earn that either. Move forward expecting nothing from your dad, not even an inheritance. A small wedding with people who actually value you as a person will be much better than a lavish wedding to show off. Focus on your family of choice and do you. You have a freedom your brothers will likely never have, so take that and move forward", "NTA", "YTA.  Your father may be wealthy, but you are an adult.  Once you become an adult, it is on you to support yourself.  \n\nYou don\u2019t want to attend his wedding because he didn\u2019t give you hundreds of thousands of dollars for you to pursue a graduate degree and he will not give you money towards your wedding.  Your affection seems to have a price tag.", "Why is that reason wrong?  It\u2019s like the last straw.  He will never treat her the same/do for her financially what he does for her brothers.  Why reward her fathers behavior?", "Right.. just go to the courthouse. The father isnt obligated to pay for her wedding. He also wasnt obligated to pay for grad school. Most kids dont even get 4 years of college paid for by their parents.", "Neither is dad entitled to a relationship with op.", "I hate that asinine I didn\u2019t/don\u2019t help you as much because you were more capable and didn\u2019t need it like your siblings did/do bs some parents throw out.  And people wonder why their kids want fuck all to do with them as adults.  Because it\u2019s favoritism, and it\u2019s wrong.  Treat your children equally.", "I did for about a year. Then, I decided in therapy two years ago that I didn\u2019t want to be a person who didn\u2019t have a relationship with their father and tried to empathize with his position. But, as you said, I am just resubmitting myself to poor treatment. I am reevaluating that idea.", "I like the way you think!", "if you\u2019re in the same industry with him and plans to keep being in that industry, I would say don\u2019t cut ties with him. Just be fake nice, even if he doesn\u2019t directly help your career, just by you being his daughter would help. If you have bad blood with him, that could potentially damage your career and your financial future. Think about the things you want in life and not everything can be emotional, to put it frankly, most of us cannot afford to make those emotional decisions. \n\nJust be fake nice with him, go to his wedding, use it as an networking opportunity for yourself. Not necessarily poaching clients but to make a good impression on other ppl that could potentially be your employers. Then only give your dad news you would share with an arm\u2019s length party.\nSee him as a non-related party and stop seeing him as family. Then treat him accordingly.", "You should probably talk about it with him when you don\u2019t have your hand out.", "Your father really was doing you a disservice by not sending you to a private high school like your brothers. There's a book you might want to consider reading that might give some insight into just how much of a disservice it was.\n\n\"The privileged poor : how elite colleges are failing disadvantaged students\" by Anthony Abraham Jack.\n\nIt may not be completely applicable to your situation. But in parts it talks about elite private high schools and some of the less obvious benefits that they provide their students.\n\nStuff beyond academics. Beyond even stuff like building study habits. Learning networking skills for one. Stuff that would have carried all through your working career.", "Called him earlier this week for his birthday to make sure his gift arrived on time. We talk all of the time\u2014probably twice a week. My dad stayed with us for a weekend in October. I also text with his fianc\u00e9 frequently, visit them several times a year, and get her gifts for holidays. She asked me to be a bridesmaid in their wedding.", "It\u2019s still not her dad\u2018s responsibility to pay for it. She made the choice to go to grad school.  \n\nShe has every right to be resentful that her brothers got special treatment; but it is seriously entitled to attribute her debt to someone else for her own choices.", "Allegedly.  Yeah, that likely translates into no  fucking way.", "3 million dollars (assuming that your father invested instead of just sitting on/spent the money) just to prove a point. That\u2019s an expensive point. Initially I figured that you were written out of the will but damn.", "You talked about how the uneven distribution of wealth makes you feel? I said talk about \u201cit\u201d. I didn\u2019t mean to insinuate that you only talk to your father when you have your hand out. It seems like you ask for money and then say it\u2019s not fair that that x got y.", "Ding ding ding!", "Imo not worth a lifetime of being in a relationship with someone whose love for you is entirely on their own terms. By the time I see that money, I will likely be in my 50s."]}
