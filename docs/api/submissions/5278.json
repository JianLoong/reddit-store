That he doesn't is clearly quite painful.  \n\nJust tell him you're on a strict budget and prefer to put your money toward your loans and your own wedding and therefore won't be able to attend.

Yet you're upset that he didn't pay for you to continue school? If it's your dream school you should of worked for it. I've met undergrads who work while going to school, some at the school itself.  Either way you still went to school and you chose to do so by going in debt. Which again, is not his fault, but yours.

Think about it. He brags about you. Keeps pushing you to chase your dreams by your own hands. If anything, he's showing you how to survive without him now, rather than later.

Certainly you aren't entitled to a free wedding. However, this should be applied equally.  Hence the question. There aren't many but I can envision a few situations where it might be reasonable not to have sent you to the same school eg if you had behavioral problems at school which had meant they wouldn't admit, if it was offered but you didn't want to attend or if your brother had disabilities and your father was only sending them because the public system didn't supply the support they needed. \n\nIf there is a good reason for why this occured then I don't think you can say that you have an entitlement to a similar amount of money being spent on you for grad school.

My partner and I make good incomes and our debts will be paid off within five years and then we will be on our way to a nice lifestyle.

He also \u201chates\u201d some women for being \u201cunlikable,\u201d he comments that the women who take time off for pregnancy at work hurt their own financial prospects, and he is always commenting on women\u2019s weights and appearance.

Here, if a parent died and left everything to a partner the children could definitely contest it and get a fairer portion.", "I\u2019d also add that I wasn\u2019t a troubled kid in anyway.

This is probably the source of the different treatment, but he would never acknowledge it. You are lucky to have had supportive parents. Really for me, it\u2019s not so much that I want money from my dad, if he couldn\u2019t afford to pay for school and a wedding, I\u2019d love him for supporting how he could\u2014even just with phone calls.

You maybe should. There's something fishy going on here that is beyond misogyny. Really fishy.", "My mother is a kind woman but is passive to a fault. She would push him to support me too, but ultimately couldn\u2019t stand up to him. As you can imagine, he\u2019s kind of a bully.

I turned down better places for the money. My choice was the only way I could pursue this profession at all. And it\u2019s irritating because his justification for not paying was I\u2019d work and pay it off easily like he did. No accounting for the cost of living, wage stagnation, inflation, or sky rocketing tuition costs.
