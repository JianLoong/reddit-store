Yet you're upset that he didn't pay for you to continue school? If it's your dream school you should of worked for it. I've met undergrads who work while going to school, some at the school itself.

Think about it. He brags about you. Keeps pushing you to chase your dreams by your own hands. If anything, he's showing you how to survive without him now, rather than later.

Certainly you aren't entitled to a free wedding. However, this should be applied equally.  Hence the question. There aren't many but I can envision a few situations where it might be reasonable not to have sent you to the same school eg if you had behavioral problems at school which had meant they wouldn't admit, if it was offered but you didn't want to attend or if your brother had disabilities and your father was only sending them because the public system didn't supply the support they needed. \n\nIf there is a good reason for why this occured then I don't think you can say that you have an entitlement to a similar amount of money being spent on you for grad school.

I turned down better places for the money. My choice was the only way I could pursue this profession at all.

It\u2019s just about making him look good to others. \n\nKeep building your own life with your SO, elope and do maybe a vow renewal a few years down the line, if a wedding is important to you. Or do a low budget thing where you can bring your own food and drinks and everyone contributes one dish or something similar.

I think his decision not to pay for the weddings shows his grad school decision was not \u201cpull yourself up by the bootstraps and learn to work for it,\u201d it was pure selfishness.

I wanted input, and I had a word limit from the mods. I didn\u2019t include every conceivable detail because of space constraints. I wasn\u2019t trying to win a case\u2014why is it impossible for you to accept that my dad is probably just objectively a sexist asshole?", "It was \u201cYou can handle public school because you are self sufficient.\u201d I made good grades in middle school, so that was true. However, my middle school grades were essentially identical to my brothers\u2019 grades. None of us had behavioral problems. His finances weren\u2019t substantially different at either point. My brother\u2019s time in HS overlapped with mine. As best I can tell, the decision was somewhat arbitrary. \n\nLater, I came to believe it was motivated by implicit sexism. Research supports this suspicion\u2014families often spend more on their sons\u2019 educations: https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/11/09/why-parents-save-more-to-send-sons-to-colleges-than-they-do-for-daughters.html", "No.", "Don't listen to him. He's probably a sad, bitter old man whose daughter doesn't talk to him any more because he always favoured his sons.", "Also, that\u2019s just one example. Here are two more:\n\nMy dad paid for one brother to play in a fancy soccer club and drove him to the practices. I also played soccer (at a higher level mind you, I was a state champion), and when my brother joined the new team I asked my dad if I could play with a more competitive club too in order to improve my chances of playing in college. My dads said that it was too far and when I was sixteen I could go and drive myself. It was 20 minutes closer than the practices he drove my brother to twice a week. \n\nMy brother and I attended the same college. My dad did not give me a monthly allowance because my \u201csorority dues were too high.\u201d My brothers fraternity dues were higher and he received an allowance \u201cto take girls on dates.\u201d Meanwhile, I had a job every semester. \n\nI could go on if you\u2019d like.", "I answered this question in another comment. But another point, I didn\u2019t ask for my dream wedding, I asked for literally any financial support of his choosing. If he would have said $500 is all I can swing, that would have been fine.", "If they are decent people, I would invite your paternal relatives to celebrate your wedding and leave dad off the guest list. Sounds like there is an entire branch of the family you haven\u2019t gotten to know well, but may enjoy and find supportive.", "Don't get him anything and use the opportunity to network.\nSounds like his current is supposed to tighten purse strings", "NTA\n\nHowever, I'd go and do a speech which states all of this and shames him and his GF.  Make it concise, in case they get someone to stop you.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about the money. It's about feeling like a second-class citizen in your own family since childhood - the money is just the most blatant example of it. It must also be really triggering to have him show off about his clever, successful daughter when you achieved everything in spite of him and not because of him.\n\nGoing NC seems like a good strategy for now but you should decide what you really want your father to understand when he asks why, and not just the issue over financial support. If he suddenly sent you a check for everything that he gave your brothers, would that solve your issues with him? I don't think it would.\n\nYou also might want to consider talking with your mother or getting some therapy together - when you were in high school, she was the adult responsible for confronting him over such obviously preferential treatment and she didn't step up for you. She should at least acknowledge that she didn't or couldn't stand up for you back then and has contributed to this situation.\n\nGood luck to you and your fianc\u00e9 for your wedding and your future together.", "NTA.  I don't blame you for being pissed as it's obvious that your father clearly favors his sons over his daughter.\n\nOne thing I would say, don't spend money on a wedding at this point in your life.  The two of you are like $180k in debt.  Last thing you need to do is spend a bunch of money on a wedding.  You are better off either having a very small ceremony at home or going down to the courhouse and getting married.  Just invite a few close friends, his parents, his siblings and perhaps his grandparents - you don't need to invite yours unless you really want them there.\n\nNow, if someone else wants to pay for your wedding, go for it.  But you'll need most of your money going forward for the next few years to pay down your debt.", "Get married same day for giggles \ud83d\ude42", "This is who he is.  He won\u2019t change.  Don\u2019t torture yourself hoping he will become something that he\u2019s not.  Elope, have the best wedding you can afford and when you get the invitation from your father, respectfully decline.  Then cut him off (along with whoever else in your family that gives you grief) and move on with your life.", "He gave exactly zero to your brothers for grad school.  And that\u2019s what you got.", "Interesting that you didn't comment on my statement that about your justifying your greed.  Your father's wealth is his to spend as he sees fit.  It is not yours.  He worked for it.   Not you.  He met his obligation to you - he housed you, feed you and educated you.   Perhaps, you can find fault with his parenting.  \n\nYour sense of entitlement is quite blatant.  The fact that you are concerned about how much you get when he dies tells me a lot about you.   I see why the fianc\u00e9e opened his eyes to who you are and had him cut you off.", "How was she concerned about how much she has been willed by him? Someone asked her and she told us what she had heard. She then went on to say she doesn\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s true and that she will ultimately make more money than anything he leaves her. You need to get a grip and stop projecting.", "Do you think that there will be any left after a few years with the new wife?", "I\u2019m having a hard time understanding why her having an issue with the fact that her father provided her brothers with more financial resources is a problem. She has even said her brothers think it\u2019s a problem. Why are her brothers worth a greater financial investment than her? While it may seem like it\u2019s just about money, it\u2019s not. The amount of money her father spent on her compared to her brothers is related to his feelings about her. Her father is not obligated to pay for her grad school or wedding, but it\u2019s horrible that he\u2018s been willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars more on her brothers. \n\nMy parents did something very similar and have now acknowledged that what they did was wrong because it is objectively wrong to not give your children an equal amount of resources/opportunities. In my case, despite being the most academically successful, my parents didn\u2019t pay for my college but did for my two younger brothers. Because I was constantly having to worry about how tuition was getting paid and working while going to school I didn\u2019t do as well in college as they did. My parents made excuses about this for years but now understand how bad what they did to me was. They\u2019ve offered to pay for me to go back to school for another degree or master's, but my college experience was so bad I just don\u2019t want to do it again. This is really sad because I always planned on getting advanced degrees and I\u2019m the only one of my siblings who will not have one. \n\nI really, really respect the poster because she has not let her situation with her dad keep her from pursuing what she wanted to in school. It also sounds like she and her fianc\u00e9 have a plan on how they\u2019re going to pay off their school loans. She\u2019s definitely not the asshole, shouldn\u2019t attend the wedding if she\u2019s even hesitating to, and should go no contact with her father. He clearly has little regard for her and she doesn\u2019t need that kind of energy in her life.", "In your post and your comments I think you are conflating multiple issues. It\u2019s not really about grad school and your wedding and his wedding. It\u2019s that his lavish wedding is the last straw for you. You have some built up resentment that you had to give up your dream grad school and now have work in a field you don\u2019t want to because he doesn\u2019t support you in ways that are very easy for him. And in his mind he\u2019s probably doing you a favour by making you to \u201cpull yourself up by your bootstraps\u201c but in your mind there is clear favouritism that means you never get the same support or recognition that your brothers do.\n\nYou still seem to like having a relationship with your father, but it\u2019s only ever on his terms. Mix in resentment of the fianc\u00e9e for her role and the fact that their lavish wedding is a financial slap in the face to you. I think this leaves you feeling like the wedding is more than you can swallow and where you make your stand. \n\nYou want to be able to assert your own power in the relationship. This is one of the very few opportunities you\u2019ll ever have to assert yourself against your father, because he doesn\u2019t need you and (I suspect) wouldn\u2019t care that much if you dropped out of touch \u2014 since he didn\u2019t care about losing touch with other family members. He certainly won\u2019t care to the point of admitting he was wrong about anything or making changes to how he treats you. But not showing up to his wedding would show him you\u2019re serious. \n\nSo you have this one opportunity to try to get his attention and make him understand how much he hurts you, but at the same time, I think deep down you don\u2019t feel right about that either. Boycotting the wedding doesn\u2019t \u201cmatch\u201d the relationship you otherwise have with your father and his fianc\u00e9e. Boycotting the wedding over money has a petty feeling to it, even though it\u2019s not actually about the money, it\u2019s about much deeper and more long-standing issues that are *manifesting* in money and weddings and stuff. \n\nSo you\u2019re kind of trapped. \n\nI think you need to be back in therapy to figure all this out, because narcissistic parents will really do a number on you. But I would suggest reflecting on some ideas:\n\n1.\tSkipping the wedding won\u2019t change anything, really. Your father isn\u2019t ever going to change how he treats you, whether you go or not. \n2.\tAs you already recognise, this relationship is entirely on his terms. You can do this his way or you can become persona non grata to him. That\u2019s actually a very painful thing to realise when you realise it fully. He doesn\u2019t need you or care about you unless you\u2019re giving him something he wants. \n3.\tThis is a very disempowering relationship for you. I feel like this is particularly getting into adulthood, marriage, career and feeling more empowered your own life, you feel the contrast with how your father makes you feel.\n2.\tThink about what a narcissistic parent gets out of the relationship that you do have? How does it make him feel big or important. \n3.\tThink about how he keeps you coming back to him and and staying close to him, and whether his narcissism plays a role in that.  Is he charismatic or manipulative? Is it crumbs of approval or that you\u2019re still trying to prove something to him? Is he funny or entertaining or makes you feel like there\u2019s an inner circle you\u2019re part of? What is he giving you (or dangling in front of you)? \n\n\nOverall I just think it\u2019s not the wedding that matters. It\u2019s about how your father makes you feel, both good and bad, and you now being in a different place in your life and how he makes you feel getting stuck in your craw in a new way.", "You\u2019re getting downvoted because you\u2019re coming off like a jerk and you\u2019re not seeming to take into account all the details of the post. You can absolutely feel like her father isn\u2019t obligated to pay for her grad school or wedding, but he is treating her very differently than her brothers, which is sad and unfair. In the post, she said that she did go to a less prestigious school because they gave her money but she still has $100,000 in debt. I think it\u2019s strange that despite his wealth her father is not even willing to pay off that $100,000 or contribute to paying it off in any way, but I understand how someone would feel differently. If I were her, it would especially rub me the wrong way because he brags about how well she's done academically, and the fact that she's in the same field as him. The OP and her fianc\u00e9 have a plan on how they\u2019re going to pay off both of their school debt, so she obviously isn\u2019t expecting any money from him at this point but her father\u2019s behavior is still shitty beyond this specific situation. \n\nI also want to say that many of the people I know who decided to be lawyers or doctors wanted to do so, to serve the public. However, because of the amount of debt they had after they finish their programs, they ended up taking jobs that they really don\u2019t want to do to pay off their loans quickly. This is EXTREMELY common. If this is not something that people did, we would have so many fewer prosecutors, public defenders, doctors, teachers, and social workers. A friend of mine has always wanted to be a public defender so he went to the best college and law school possible so he would have an education that would allow him to be great in the field, because of this he graduated with hundreds of thousands of dollars in school debt. Just so you know he had saved up money for undergrad, had scholarships and grants, and worked every summer. After he graduated from law school, he worked in corporate law for 4 years to pay off his debt. Most of the work he did went against his values, but he knew that public defenders make no money and he didn\u2019t want several hundred thousand dollars of debt hanging over his head. I\u2019m always bothered when people make comments about how school debt is an individual's problem but when there\u2019s no one to take care of you in a nursing home or to teach your kids or to treat you when you have a health concern you\u2019re gonna have a problem with that.", "Even if there is, she\u2019s nine years older than me. So, I\u2019ll likely see it in my 80s, if ever.", "Wow. You\u2019re an asshole. There is nothing wrong with a child discussing how their education is going to be paid for if there is an expectation that they will be getting a post-secondary education. She\u2019s not just randomly asking him for money. And it is unfair he\u2018s invested more money into her brothers' education. Do you not find that strange? You made that comment because you\u2019re a jerk. There is nothing in her post that indicates that she is only reaching out to her father when she needs money. She even expressed gratitude for what he has given her because she is thoughtful enough to recognize that\u2019s more than what most people get.", "Sorry you feel like I\u2019m coming off like a jerk. I don\u2019t give a shit what people like you think about me personally. I just think it\u2019s weird that people are downloading indisputable facts. \n\nIt is an indisputable fact that she alone made the choice to go to college. She did not have to. There are many occupations out there that pay well and I don\u2019t require a college degree. \n\nIrrespective of that, she is responsible for her life and no one else\u2019s. I clearly acknowledge in my post that her resentment is understandable. I\u2019m well aware of the double standard that her father is applying. It\u2019s still inaccurate for her to attribute her debt to him. There\u2019s no way you can truthfully make the claim that her father is responsible for her school debt. It\u2019s just completely divorced from the facts.", "I literally said I didn\u2019t mean to infer that she was only reaching out for money. I am obviously not getting my point across. I think she needs to discuss with her father that the uneven distribution of his wealth makes her feel that he loves her less than, when she is not asking for a hand out.", "So he told you he was sending your brothers to private school because they weren\u2019t self sufficient.", "The last three paragraphs of your post is about how your dad is having a lavish wedding but he won\u2019t give you any money for yours.

He helped a lot of people make good money and had connections, but he was not always a nice guy about it. I didn't realize any of that as a child, but looking back now I'm not sure I would be as proud of him as I was back then.\n\n\nAlso, I have a feeling that the people at the wedding will largely not be within your field anyways.", "So, the father is not supposed to enjoy the benefits of his effort to become financially successful.
