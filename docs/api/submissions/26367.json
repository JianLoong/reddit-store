Back when I was 21 I was engaged to my ex Frankie (30m) and I had just found out I was pregnant. I told Elizabeth because she was my big sister and we were there for each other. It had been a huge shock to me because I got pregnant while on birth control. Elizabeth acted slightly off when I told her and at the time I thought she was disappointed in me getting pregnant before finishing college. Days after I told her I was pregnant she told me she and Frankie had been together behind my back for three years of my five year relationship with him. Not only were they going behind my back like that but he had proposed to her and given her a family ring. She told me she wanted me to get an abortion and leave them to be together.\n\nI miscarried around the time everything was coming out. I ended the engagement and Frankie moved in with Elizabeth. I did not speak to either of them again. My parents were torn between both of us. My grandma, who lives with my parents, had been firmly on my side. They said what Elizabeth had done was awful but she was still a good person. We all knew the kindness she had inside of her and how she had been a good big sister until she wasn't. They respected that I did not want anything to do with Elizabeth when I was firm though and they did not try to change my mind.\n\n8 years later and I'm happily married now and expecting a baby with my husband Gray. Elizabeth and Frankie did get married after and they have children together. My parents have grown very concerned over Elizabeth as a mother. Grandma said she's very shallow and treats her kids like they're accessories and cares little for them or their wellbeing. She just wants them to look good and wear the cute things she picks out. Grandma rolled her eyes telling me all this.\n\nMy parents are trying to intervene and protect Elizabeth's kids. They have mentioned it to me twice. The last time I got some vibes from them that they might ask me to intervene as well. I decided to get ahead of their ask by telling them I am not going to get involved in helping them with Elizabeth's kids. I said it felt like they were on the verge of asking and I wanted to save them the effort. My parents were stunned and questioned why I wouldn't want to get to know my nieces. I said we might be blood related but that was as far as it would go given what their parents had done to me. I also told my parents I had no obligation to expose myself to Elizabeth again. And that it didn't surprise me too much that someone who would betray their own sister that way and ask her to get an abortion so her own relationship with my ex would be easier, would be a shitty mom to her kids and would see them as accessories.\n\nMy parents said my attitude is too cold and since I have moved on and found happiness, I should find love for my nieces.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694089389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cegy2/aita_letting_my_parents_know_i_am_not_getting/", "score": 211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sorry. And there\u2019s not much more to say.", "Damn. I hate your parents, but I love your grandma! What is wrong with them?! NTA!", "NTA, but also what are you supposed to do in this situation? In the name of being close to your nieces, it seems like they're basically asking you to play pseudo-mommy to your sister's kids every now and then so they can actually have a good mother figure.\n\nNot your problem. While it sucks for the kids, I dont think its an entirely dire situation. Your parents should be the one to stage an intervention if they feel so strongly. Also where is Frankie in all this?", "NTA.\nGee, can't imagine why your sister turned out to be a crappy mother when she revealed herself to be a crappy person! Your parents are in a pit of delusion surrounding your sister and that's a mess of their own making. \n\nYes, your nieces are innocent in this but that's collateral damage that happened when their morally bankrupt mother did what she did. You cannot, and should not, be expected to help out when it'll mean close quarters contact with someone who, without any remorse, hurt you. \n\nYour parents need to do better. They failed in raising your sister, so now having to save their grandchildren from her toxic nature is their reward. They better get to it instead of trying to palm the work off on someone else.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like you have some good practice in going low/ no contact. If your parents persist it might be good to lean on those skills and put some distance between you and them too.\n\nJust.... I'm so sorry you went through that and that your parents, sister, and ex are such crappy people.

You have no obligation to any of your blood relatives after how they treated you. Good luck.", "NTA", "Nope, she called it and has to live. Your parents alongside her. Absolutely nothing in your post says AH to me. Her kids are not your responsibility and all that is required is that you be civil to them. It's not their doing but you still don't owe them anything.", "Nta. Tell your parents you have found happiness. But that happiness won\u2019t give you rose color glasses for the world and make you forget the hurt that you suffered under the betrayal your sister did to you. You don\u2019t owe anything to those kids. You already made it clear you wanted nothing to do with your sister so they shouldn\u2019t push you now.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nToo cold? lmao it's nice enough you don't immediately shut down any conversation that involves your sister in any way. Why is it that you have to be dragged down to her level now that you have found happiness? If they want to help their grandchildren it's not like you're stopping them. Now that would be unreasonable. But you are not obligated to help your dysfunctional sister with her bullshit.\n\nDon't let them pull the family card bullshit. Did she see you as her lil sister and family when she decided to cheat with your ex?", "NTA.  Stay away from your sister.  Your parents are not exactly nice people in this situation either.  If they keep pushing I would take a break from them too.  Hope your awesome grandmother has a very long and healthy life!", "NTA. Your nieces may be blameless in all of this, but their mother is their mother. That means you cannot get involved. Period.", "NTA\n\nGiven that Elizabeth wanted you to kill your kid to make it easier for her to be with your fiance, I can completely understand your lack of interest in having anything to do with her. A woman who tries to have her niece/nephew killed for being inconvenient, sleeps with her sister's fiance, and neglects her own children is not a good person at heart.", "Unfortunately, finding love for your nieces will mean being in touch with their parents.  So something you can't won't do.\n\nNTA", "NTA by far. Healthy boundaries are healthy boundaries even if other people don't get it.  Yes the kids are innocent and yes, sometimes family deserves a ride or die mentality. But that's not the family you have. Not saying your parents were wrong for supporting your sister when needed, but it is wrong for them to pressure you.\n\n I feel like I see things like this all the time and people cling to that, oh we're blood so every trespass needs forgiving, deal. The truth is YOLO, decisions were made in other adult lives and you don't deserve to HAVE to dig deep because things aren't going okay for these other adults. Your family could have/maybe should have put down a harder foot when your sister pulled that lifetime movie network move to avoid this moment down the road. If you're truly happy, I wouldn't risk wrecking your mentality. Most kids have to deal w something or the other that isn't perfect (even unpleasant) in their lives. It does not dictate that you need to sacrifice yourself. It does not make you less for sticking to your guns. They'll be fine.", "NTA", "Grandma was the support during all that.

Anyone who told me the woman who slept with my fianc\u00e9 for 3 years then told me to get an abortion, was a \"good person,\" would be out of my life faster than they could blink.\n\nPeople always think that \"not choosing,\" is a neutral act.  But that's bullshit. When one person so clearly harms another, not choosing tells the victim exactly what your values are.", "Probably having another affair.", "Exactly it's not like this was a drunken one night stand. They were cheating for 3 fucking years. How in all hells can you say someone was a 'good-person-that-did-a-bad-thing' when they been lying to their faces for 3 years straight? That's sociopathic behavior.", "Why would they cut off their ties with their mother for their aunt whom they dont even know?", "The kids will live.", "Which is very valid, you can\u2019t get the nieces without their parents being involved. Nieces have grandparents and a great grandmother, they don\u2019t need the aunt or cousins.", "Grandma's the best.", "They're still married as far as I know. Not too sure after that.", "NTA.

They don't want to look after the kids.", "But your parents DID choose.

I don't blame you for telling them that you're not surprised that a shitty person turned out to be a shitty mom. \n\nHowever, there was no point in making extraneous comments re having no desire to help your nephews and nieces. That does make you look bad and I can see why they got upset. Kids they love are suffering and you preemptively say IDGAF??? \n\nYou would have made life easier for yourself if you'd told your parents that it's not possible to have a relationship with the kids when there is no relationship with the parents.
