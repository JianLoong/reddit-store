Back when I was 21 I was engaged to my ex Frankie (30m) and I had just found out I was pregnant. I told Elizabeth because she was my big sister and we were there for each other. It had been a huge shock to me because I got pregnant while on birth control. Elizabeth acted slightly off when I told her and at the time I thought she was disappointed in me getting pregnant before finishing college. Days after I told her I was pregnant she told me she and Frankie had been together behind my back for three years of my five year relationship with him. Not only were they going behind my back like that but he had proposed to her and given her a family ring. She told me she wanted me to get an abortion and leave them to be together.\n\nI miscarried around the time everything was coming out. I ended the engagement and Frankie moved in with Elizabeth. I did not speak to either of them again. My parents were torn between both of us. My grandma, who lives with my parents, had been firmly on my side. They said what Elizabeth had done was awful but she was still a good person. We all knew the kindness she had inside of her and how she had been a good big sister until she wasn't. They respected that I did not want anything to do with Elizabeth when I was firm though and they did not try to change my mind.\n\n8 years later and I'm happily married now and expecting a baby with my husband Gray. Elizabeth and Frankie did get married after and they have children together. My parents have grown very concerned over Elizabeth as a mother.

Grandma rolled her eyes telling me all this.\n\nMy parents are trying to intervene and protect Elizabeth's kids. They have mentioned it to me twice. The last time I got some vibes from them that they might ask me to intervene as well. I decided to get ahead of their ask by telling them I am not going to get involved in helping them with Elizabeth's kids. I said it felt like they were on the verge of asking and I wanted to save them the effort. My parents were stunned and questioned why I wouldn't want to get to know my nieces. I said we might be blood related but that was as far as it would go given what their parents had done to me. I also told my parents I had no obligation to expose myself to Elizabeth again. And that it didn't surprise me too much that someone who would betray their own sister that way and ask her to get an abortion so her own relationship with my ex would be easier, would be a shitty mom to her kids and would see them as accessories.\n\nMy parents said my attitude is too cold and since I have moved on and found happiness, I should find love for my nieces.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694089389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cegy2/aita_letting_my_parents_know_i_am_not_getting/", "score": 3653, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your parents are in a pit of delusion surrounding your sister and that's a mess of their own making. \n\nYes, your nieces are innocent in this but that's collateral damage that happened when their morally bankrupt mother did what she did.

The truth is YOLO, decisions were made in other adult lives and you don't deserve to HAVE to dig deep because things aren't going okay for these other adults. Your family could have/maybe should have put down a harder foot when your sister pulled that lifetime movie network move to avoid this moment down the road.

If Elizabeth was dead or had surrendered custody it\u2019d be a much fairer question.", "good for you, tbh. your parents don\u2019t seem to realise that they\u2019re using the justification of \u201cyou\u2019ve moved on and found happiness\u201d to ask you to sacrifice your happiness and peace of mind for two people who don\u2019t care about anyone other than themselves. not even their kids. your parents can help their grandkids all they want, they\u2019re the ones who stood by this shitshow of a relationship. it\u2019s nothing to do with you, and thank fuck for that. god knows what your sister would try to pull if she had any kind of access to your life again. nta.", "It\u2019s worth considering that these kids will one day be adults, potentially adults who resent your sister just as much as you do. \n\nOne day it\u2019ll be possible to have a relationship with them without their parents\u2019 involvement. *That* might be something you\u2019d want, or at least want to look into. But that\u2019s an entirely different question than reconnecting with your sister for the sake of helping your parents with childcare.", "Because they haven't listened to anything she's said thus far, and haven't respected the boundaries she's drawn, and she finally just had to flat out restate her stance in terms that are unmistakable and unambiguous. And in the heat of the moment, its tough to come up with something more diplomatic.", "Those two sound like they were made for each other.", "Not necessarily. Especially since we don't know what exactly her parents want her to do.", "Well, *which* help do they want from you?", "Mom is a definite maybe, and grandma certainly won't be interested.", "Again to reply to you these are not RANDOM children to OP, they are RANDOM children to me! No someone shouldn\u2019t have to save a RANDOM child but these are not RANDOM children!!!! Are u blind!!!! They are her family! and the rest of her family are obviously trying to help the children and by not participating in that she is actively washing her hands of the situation and condemning these children to a potentially traumatic upbringing.", "She\u2019s their aunt, and has the facilities to call child cervices, call the police, or even just talk to the mother and convince her. I am a stranger on the internet who knows zero things about this family and therefore can do nothing. If I knew them I would help yes. Do not equate a stranger to a family member who is conscientiously objecting to help.", "I cannot fathom the leap you have just taken to say that I, a random Redditor, have the same moral and legal rights to help a child I don\u2019t even know is real, to a family member of that child", "Ok? You aren't OP, and her kids aren't you. I'm asking OP how she'll handle it, not for every redditor to chime in about how close they are with their cousins, bc chances are, your cousins aren't parented by your mother's ex and her sister.", "I am looking at it from my upbringing, we were a tight family all holidays and birthdays spent together, close enough in age to be friends too. So my \"losing out\" comment is in relation to all the good times that can be had during family functions and life in general.", "Yes\n\nBut that wasn't the topic at hand here", "Don't minimise my opinion because I have personal experience.\n\nI shared that only to give the OP some insight from that perspective. They are here asking the question so are obviously more open to it than you are.", "That's what I'm thinking.  \n\nThe parents will babysit all the grandchildren then say \"they love each other and separating them is cruel, so OP needs to step up and help ALL the kids\"\n\nThe parents will view the grandchildren as a way to bring the family together.", "> There are kids involved\n\nNo, there are kids involved *now,* there were no kids involved back when OP was still engaged and pregnant, and her sister cheated on her with her fiancee for 3 years, which is when the parents said \"don't ask us to choose\". So no, it's not more complecated than that.", "As nice the thought is that these kids might end up being good adults, the likely hood of that is pretty slim. \n\nThey are being raised by two selfish people who don\u2019t care about being good parents. Their grandparents may try to instill some good values in the children, but they already failed at that with one of their own kids so\u2026 they probably won\u2019t succeed in that.", "Once youre estranged from a family member, their kids might as well be a strangers kids. Except, unlike with a stranger, you cannot give their parents benefit of the doubt that they raised them to be decent humans. It's sort of like, meeting a stranger but knowing they were raised by bad people. Would you choose to bring a totally random stranger into your life? How about the other stranger who you know was raised by an AH? \nAnd of course, OP has no obligation to how these people might feel in the future, or to maintain a close relationship with them. The situation may suck for them, but it did for her too, and its neithrr of their faults. They should also understand that, if they ever come to a point of wanting to reach out to OP. It's also a lot of effort and time to be close to anyone, let alone someone in this particular sutuation. I for one wouldn't judge OP at all for not wanting to open that unknown can of worms. Especially with a sister like hers who, once an attachment is formed, could simply use it against both OP and the kids as well. There's too many variables. I would be tempted to get involved and understand the temptation to do so. But unless I did not have kids myself that i would also be involving, i would not get involved myself either.", "She will. It\u2019s impossible not to once she involves herself.", "Question - what do you think OP could do for those kids?  It all begins at home with the parenting.  Op is about to be a new mother and have her own kids.  What could she possibly do to help shape them- when she (justifiably) wont even go to her sisters house. How is she supposed to have long term impact when she is estranged from the parents?", "Being involved in the kids lives. Possibly checking in on them and maybe even trying to talk their parents around. But it would definitely involve me meeting the kids.", "It doesn't matter. She doesn't want to help. End of story. She is not obligated to help. They're not her kids. She has made her decision and placed her boundaries. Why are you questioning them so hard? Is your name Elizabeth or Frankie? Sheesh..", "> Well, which help do they want from you?\n\nOP does not owe any of these people help. PERIOD!!!! I understand that the children are innocent, but she is not obligated to help in ANY way. Regardless of whether or not she sees them/their parents.", "Stop, stop! You're reminding of that post from a couple weeks ago where that woman's mom stole her husband and had kids with him", ">They are her family\n\nNo they aren\u2019t.", "She\u2019s not their aunt.  She\u2019s someone who used to know their mom 8 years ago before they were born.", "They aren\u2019t family.  Elizabeth chose to sever that bond and OP has literally never met the kids.  So yes, she has the **exact** same moral and legal responsibility to them as a totally random person on the internet does.", "Ok?  Why attack people just sharing their experiences?  What is wrong with you, did you have shitty affair parents too?  Are you just super close and so in love with your personal family dynamic that you have to shit on others experiences?", "Key words \"tight family\", something OP's is clearly not. People who have great families just don't seem to understand when others don't have great families.", "Lol, OP asked for your experience and opinion too!! Reddit has been going wild lately idk", "Then those parents should never be allowed to babysit OP's kids. Simple. Straightforward. It's part and parcel of going LC", "Oh they're absolutely already leaning that way, I'm sure. This is why they were so surprised to hear OP didn't want to \"get to know\" her nieces. In their minds they're seeing a future babysitting OP's kids and Elizabeth's kids, forcing them all to play together so they become friends so *of course* OP and Elizabeth reconnect. *barf*", "> As nice the thought is that these kids might end up being good adults, the likely hood of that is pretty slim.\n\nThis is complete bunk.  Children aren't carbon copies of their parents, especially as adults.  My strongest drives as an adult and now a father are to be better than my parents.  This is not uncommon.", "Parents: \"Hey, could you buy a bunch of children's clothing in sizes xyz? We'll pay you back.\"\n\nNo contact with the homewreckers.\n\nAgain, it really depends on what exactly the Parents would want from her. \n\nHeck, maybe they intend to win custody of the grandkids, and want to ask if she would babysit them sometimes afterwards. No contact with the homewreckers either.\n\nAs long as they're not asking her to play nice with her sister and the ex, I don't see the problem.", "Don't do it it's not worth your mental health. If your parents want to help the kids they are welcome to put in the effort but this has nothing at al to do with YOU. Also they have a freaking father (he's an aH)whose responsibility is to correct your sister tell them to talk to HIM.", "Can I ask- how far does this poor treatment go? \n\nAre we talking neglect/abuse? Or more general sh*tty parenting?\n\nYour sister doesn\u2019t care what you have to say, and she likely doesn\u2019t want you around the kids in a \u201csupportive\u201d way either. If things are bad, your parents should call the children\u2019s schools and report their concerns.", "Ah.\n\nWell, you're a) in no position to \"talk the parents around\", and b) can hardly check up on them at their family home, and c) this would indeed put you into contact with your sister and the ex.\n\nErgo nta.\n\nBut also, put that info up with the rest of the post.", "We both have different opinions on people's general responsibility regarding the prevention from child abuse then...\n\nBut anyway, OP has sensibly provided an answer in which she specified what exactly her boundaries are, and she is indeed nta.", "Ooh! Do you happen to have the link? I\u2019m very curious on how that story went down.", "So a firefighter who has severed a bond with his family, then they get trapped in a fire is morally fine ignoring it and letting them die?", "That\u2019a not the help needed. The kids have clothes and things. It\u2019s not a money thing but a care thing.", "I have no idea. I have never met the kids so all I know is what I have heard from my parents mostly.", "Well, see, the thing is, that abuse is a fiction written by the parents to force contact between OP and her sister. \n\nThey are lying.", "I'll dig for it. The gist of the story actually happened 8 years later, the mom's kid and OP's kid had ended up in the same class and the mom threw a fit in public because her kid wasn't invited to the OP's kid's birthday party. Mom's kid is also kind of a bully so she wouldn't have been invited either way. I think OP had to have her kid transferred to a different class. \n\nAw beans, it got nuked. You can look at the comments at least: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1665mgw/aita\\_for\\_not\\_inviting\\_my\\_half\\_sister\\_to\\_my/", "He has the exact same responsibility to them as some random stranger, so no, he can\u2019t leave them to die if it\u2019s his job to save them just like he would anyone else.  But they have no *more* responsibility to them than any random stranger either.", "Again: we don't  know.\n\nI asked for info, OP didn't answer yet.\n\nWe'll see.", "Yeah this is weird. Almost sounds like a reason to force contact. \u201cDo it for the kids\u201d but again, your sister isn\u2019t exactly considerate of your feelings- you can\u2019t actually help here. \n\nYou\u2019re doing the right thing in keeping your distance, imo", "Given how in the post OP mentions what she has heard about the mistreatment of these kids, it seems to be a case of emotional neglect. Which requires far more involvement than simply buying clothes or providing financially."]}
