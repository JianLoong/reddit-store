So he's just standing there, bleeding, while an ill-fitting tutu crushes his balls (its child sized, but he fit into it dammit), and faking a smile through the pain while this 3 year old tries to take a picture but keeps dropping his phone.\n\nAnd that is literally the manliest, most metal image I can imagine.", "Wonder if he would take away Ice T or Terry Crews \"man card,\" since I've seen them both do this. They also made statements to the naysayer pathetic little boys who didn't think it was \"gangster.\"", "There exist times where the joke really is incredibly benign and the other person overreacts. This\u2026is not one of those times.", "The joke is, \"haha, look at this loser, being a *good dad* and being *involved* with his daughters' lives. I bet he even has *empathy* like a *girl*! Haha\"\n\nAt least, that's what I read.", "I sure hope he doesn't have any children. Especially daughters. Can you imagine the toxicity he would be projecting on those poor kids?", "This is incredibly succinct and illuminating. Love it!", "It's not gaslighting when two people believe different things about a situation.\n\nGaslighting is when one person knows something is true, but says that it isn't true to make someone think they are having hallucinations or delusions.\n\n\"It was just a joke!\" is an asshole lacking empathy.\n\n\"I didn't say anything, you must be hearing things\" is gaslighting.", "No. Gaslighting is much more specific. Emotional manipulation =/= gaslighting", "OP thinks it\u2019s fun to shit on things girls enjoy. He is probably one of those people that ridicules everything marketed for or heavily enjoyed by women.", "\u201cOh my brother isn\u2019t a girly girl, just not a card carrying man, because obviously if his wife hadn\u2019t died he\u2019d have stayed home, no way it could be a \u201cwhich of us is better at tolerating screaming crowds for literally hours nonstop\u201d so anyway I am not the sibling of a bad sissy, just one situationally one so don\u2019t doubt my, OPs, own maleness based on proximity\u201d", "I love these, too! It sets the bar exactly where we want it for that generation.", "The number of men (with and without children!) I saw today wearing Micky or Minnie Mouse ears at Disney was awesome.", "Also\u2026what, men aren\u2019t allowed to enjoy female music artists or they\u2019re not real men or something?\n\nI\u2019m no Swiftie, but I appreciate some of her albums.  Midnights is probably my favorite since Lover.\n\nIt\u2019s pop.  Basically everyone loves pop to some degree.\n\nMy brother got floor tickets to see her in Vegas (lucky AH got them last minute for free).  My partner and I were supposed to see her in Nashville, but ended up selling our tickets because something else came up that weekend that we have to go to.  Though he might have just been humouring me - dude loves me and basically doesn\u2019t care what we do as long as it\u2019s together.  He\u2019s willing (his suggestion) to go to Universal Horror Nights with me and he HAAAATES horror lol.", "Honestly, it\u2019d be just as bad with sons. Toxic masculinity sucks for everybody. :/", "Kinda like saying \"It's just a joke\" knowing full well it's not, and expecting the other person to acquiesce.", "It could become gaslighting. But unless the argument is you insulted me vs no I didn't I was joking about you. Its probably not gaslighting.", "It is bad to teach boys to think like this, but I feel like it is worse to teach girls to accept this type of treatment.", "These people genuinely do think their victims are overreacting, and whatever they did is not a big deal at all.\n\nSee: this post", "Gaslighting can also include minimizing other people\u2019s feelings.  So in this event, the \u201cyou\u2019re overreacting\u201d could be a form of gaslighting.", "It would only become gaslighting if OP was intentionally trying to make his brother believe he was crazy/losing his grip on reality.  That's a pretty big step up from just lying about the situation.", "They're correct. Op is a creep.", "Yes thats why I said it could become it if the argument was one that could lead to OP trying make the brother question his own ability to reason.  I'm sorry I didn't communicate to your specific standards.", "LOL No matter how often I've spelled \"fucking\" on my iPhone, it still reverts to ducking!!", "Calm down, it's a discussion forum, people have discussions.  Not everything is an attack on you."]}
