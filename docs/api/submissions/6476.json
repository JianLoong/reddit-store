When we first started living together I had told him I don't like dogs. I can list many reasons but that's not the point. I told him that I don't want his dog on the bed because she licks her paws from anxiety and leaves a slobbery puddle and that I don't want her around when I'm eating because she begs loudly. And I also don't allow her in my son's room. He ignores all these boundaries I put in place. He will blatantly let her do these things both behind my back and in front of me. And when I remind him he gets an attitude and will praise her as he guides her away. I would also like to say besides this I love everything about him and I'm not mean to the dog. I give her treats and pet her. Anyway, the dog has been recently dealing with seizures and really bad anxiety to where she pees inside, she can't sit still, when my fiance leaves early in the morning she will jump on me and whine when I'm still trying to sleep. And if I try to leave her outside the room she runs around scratching walls, doors, and whining louder. On top of that she keeps getting into the trash. She is a very old dog and she obviously needs her seizures checked out and training but he thinks she's too old to be trained and to let her age in peace. I think if he won't train her then he should maybe re-home her. I've given him this whole 2 years to get the behavior fixed and idk what to do. I try to train her but her anxiety is making her not listen. I'll tell her to get off the bed and she starts jumping on me and scratching me and if I try to push her off she digs her paws and nails into the blankets/my clothes and holds on for dear life. I'm probably the AH but I also would like advice for the dogs behavior before I lose my mind.", "created_utc": 1672852466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10390cp/aita_for_wanting_my_fiance_to_rehome_his_dog/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It would be cruel to the dog to rehome them now, but I can't call you the AH to being at a point where you are over dealing with the situation. \n\nSecond, you agreed to live with the dog with a set of very easy rules to follow.

That is why you are NTA in this situation. If he had worked for the last two years to keep the dog off the bed and out of your son's room, then you wouldn't feel the way you do now. This is a result of HIS disregard for your home, your comfort, and your agreement. When he lets the dog in the bed, he is making it so the dog has behavioral issues when not allowed on the bed. HE DID THIS. \n\nI also read in your comments that the dog has actually injured you, has peed in your son's bed, and was kind of \"given\" to your fiance after you two were together.

When we first started living together I had told him I don't like dogs. I can list many reasons but that's not the point. I told him that I don't want his dog on the bed because she licks her paws from anxiety and leaves a slobbery puddle and that I don't want her around when I'm eating because she begs loudly. And I also don't allow her in my son's room. He ignores all these boundaries I put in place. He will blatantly let her do these things both behind my back and in front of me. And when I remind him he gets an attitude and will praise her as he guides her away. I would also like to say besides this I love everything about him and I'm not mean to the dog. I give her treats and pet her. Anyway, the dog has been recently dealing with seizures and really bad anxiety to where she pees inside, she can't sit still, when my fiance leaves early in the morning she will jump on me and whine when I'm still trying to sleep. And if I try to leave her outside the room she runs around scratching walls, doors, and whining louder. On top of that she keeps getting into the trash. She is a very old dog and she obviously needs her seizures checked out and training but he thinks she's too old to be trained and to let her age in peace. I think if he won't train her then he should maybe re-home her. I've given him this whole 2 years to get the behavior fixed and idk what to do. I try to train her but her anxiety is making her not listen. I'll tell her to get off the bed and she starts jumping on me and scratching me and if I try to push her off she digs her paws and nails into the blankets/my clothes and holds on for dear life. I'm probably the AH but I also would like advice for the dogs behavior before I lose my mind.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I had a similar situation with an animal, and my SO at the time supported me, tearfully, yet still supported me, in deciding that the animal had to go. And it went. That\u2019s just the harsh truth. The alternative is suffer a life where you randomly get hurt because that animal has a bad day or even bad moment or whatever the problem is. \n\nLet me relate a different story. Ants. There are people out there who, due to ants\u2019 persistence, just give up and tolerate living in their house with ants infesting it. They just accept it. They become unwilling and even hostile towards suggestions they find solutions. Even when that solution is just paying an exterminator to get rid of them. I know this because my exterminators told me about such people. It\u2019s because these people accepted living a less than good life. \n\nSo that\u2019s it. Do you want a good life, or do you want to accept needless compromises because someone decided to life less than a good life and decided for you that you must, too?", "Edit: saw your comment about your son being special needs, changed judgment from E S H to NTA.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sucks because he openly disregards your few reasonable boundaries - sorry, but I would also not like dog slobber and dander in my bed or my child's room, especially if the child is on the younger side. He literally tries to play you and the dog against each other. And doing this knowing your child is special needs? Why are you with this man?\n\nYou wanting to rehome a sick and old dog, however understandable, would be the wrong move. She needs medical care and training, not a new home.\n\nMy suggestion?

There\u2019s no \u201crehoming\u201d her. So somebody needs to either step up and train this poor dog and get her the proper vet care she needs or have enough empathy for the dog to, at the very least, be there with her while she gets euthanized to ensure that she is not afraid and she does not die alone.\n\nAgain, I am not advocating for them to put down their dog.

You are the BIGGEST and most ignorant and selfish asshole I have seen on this page in a long time. I\u2019m going to give good advice that you need to follow first, then give my real opinion: \n\nTAKE THE DOG TO THE VET. It is sick and suffering. If it is having seizures and is losing continence, it could have a brain tumor or cancer. Your \u201cproblems\u201d could be solved by needing to put the dog down due to its health. Most vets also have options for payment plans if it\u2019s something that can be cured. A dog who has suddenly become incontinent DOESN\u2019T NEED TRAINING, it needs MEDICAL ATTENTION. Please do not disregard this advice regardless of my opinion below. For the sake of the dog and your fianc\u00e9, take the damn dog to the vet. \n\nBut no, you want to just get rid of a senior dog, with health problems, separation anxiety, etc, who has already been abandoned once before so that you don\u2019t have to deal with the responsibility of pet ownership. \n\nPersonally, I vote your fianc\u00e9 frees up some of his finances by dumping you.

Vet care is essential... animals need regular preventative care and, at times, emergency care. If they cannot or will not provide this, then I think it's more cruel for the dog to stay with them. OP already expressed that she doesn't want the animal...the dog has severe anxiety and seizures. Being in a home where it's unwanted isn't helping.\n\n\nHonestly, I think it would be best for the dog if they  P found a rescue that can help the poor dog...re-homing the dog might help with lowering it's anxiety and give it a chance to have a good, long healthy life with people who will love her/him.", "She\u2019s NTA because he cannot afford the vet and this dog is suffering.
