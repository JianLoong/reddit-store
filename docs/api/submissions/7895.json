I get you tried, but now you know not to go there.", "NAH you did the right thing by approaching her with the clothes instead of going behind her back, but shes most likely still pretty full of hormones, combined with what could be a post partum depression. There is nothing wrong with her aspiring to lose weight again, but if it affects other parts of her life too, she should consult a therapist.", "NAH. You meant well but your wife isn't an AH for how she feels.", "Ehh NAH, you tried your best but this definitely wasnt the best approach.. in her eyes you buying a bigger size means that you think she wont lose the weight...\nIts not just about extreme weightloss for her.. for more than 9 months (probably more now) she hasnt been in control of her body and hasnt felt comfortable in her body.. like this body isnt hers...\nBest thing to do is just support her in her journey now but keep emphasising that you love how she looks now.. untill she is ready to accept her new body", "NTA for trying to make her feel better about herself just unfortunate it didn\u2019t have the desired effect. Don\u2019t give up telling her she still looks amazing, November wasn\u2019t that long ago I\u2019m sure you are both still adjusting, it will get better.", "NAH", "NAH.\n\nYou saw that your wife was in need of something and you tried to provide it.\n\nBut post-partum stress, hormones, and weight issues are a deep well which no one who hasn\u2019t been through it can really fathom. Keep telling her and showing her how beautiful she is. Don\u2019t say ANYTHING about her weight, gains or losses, because no matter how you say it, right now, she will likely only hear it in a negative sense. If she wants new clothes, she\u2019ll buy them. Your goal right now should be to remove as much of the stress on her body and mind as you can. That may mean doing more than 50/50 on chores and baby care for right now.", "Your intentions were clear, you just wanted to support her. However, she took that as you saying she is too fat.\n\nNAH, but please just support her emotionally and actually assure her that you don't care about her weight. Either way, I hope your son is healthy.", "I wouldn\u2019t say YTA. You had good intentions BUT you executed incorrectly. Weight loss is a touchy and difficult subject for a lot of people especially women let alone women who have just given birth. \n\nYour wife most likely is struggling to love and accept herself and you buying her bigger clothes maybe triggered her which caused her to spiral. The best way to help is just ask what you can do. Reassure her she\u2019s beautiful but don\u2019t smother her about it. It\u2019s not healthy being obsessed with weight loss but if it\u2019s happening and she refuses to see a doctor the best you can do is encourage her to build healthier habits and support her so she\u2019s not doing anything dangerous behind your back. It will take time and patience but doing things behind her back will definitely not help. Good luck!", "NTA, but this is one of those things to just leave alone. Baby weight is a really sore spot with a lot of people.", "This is a difficult one, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s mad a you. Just mad at herself.", "YTA\n\nYou should have had enough emotional intelligence to figure out this was going to backfire. Your wife is an adult and knows how to buy new clothes, if that's what she wants.", "NTA that was a nice thing to do and she might appreciate it later on", "YTA, you never buy women clothes unless she specifically sends you to the shop for something. \n\nWomens clothing varies in size from shop to shop. It takes us years to figure out which places have clothing that fits the size you are trying to buy. If you are a size 10-12, there's no guarantee that the shop's size 10-12 will fit, you might have to go up 1 or 2 sizes & that just makes you feel like shit. You know to avoid those stores. (Topshop were notorious for much smaller clothing sizes).", "NTA. It was a kind thought and you meant well. That's all that really matters. She shouldn't really have said you're wrong for buying the clothes for her, but it sounds like she's struggling with a lot of emotions at the moment.\n\nRather consider whether she might need help for post partum depression, as there might be more than just the weight bringing her down. Not saying she definitely has PPD, but if she does, she could probably do with some help for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Body image is a big issue for women, created by the bs societal expectations put on us.  Unfortunately hormones from pregnancy can make that worse.  During pregnancy women tend to already feel unattractive because of the changes our bodies go through, when that weight doesn't drop immediately after birth it's a hard blow to an already fragile self esteem caused by pregnancy, and again the bs societal expectations.  Your heart was in the right place, just the execution was wrong.  Maybe try the approach of telling her she's beautiful to you, but if she would like you'll start working out with her, walking together, doing yoga (yes guys can do yoga so save my the guys are too masculine for that nonsense), maybe go to the gym together, as a way to support, and help her.  She hears what you're saying, but maybe she's not feeling supported in her bid to lose the weight.  Give her that, and be earnest about it.  Don't just say it then not do it.\n\nI also recommend you suggest, GENTLY, that she talk to her doctor about PPD.  Good luck.", "Yta, although the thoughts are nice what your saying is she won\u2019t fit that size and here\u2019s a constitute.\nIf you want to be helpful maybe do family walks or make a healthy meal. Also personally I never lost weight until I stopped breastfeeding, I guess a hormonal thing.", "Soft YTA I get that you have good intentions but she's an adult, if she wanted to buy new clothes she would have done it herself", "NTA but I would never want my partner to buy clothes for me. Sizes are never the same for one and the couple of things my ex did buy me were nms. Clothes are so hard for women and you really need to try everything on both for size and to se how it looks. Even in the same brand sizes differ.", "YTA", "ESH. Dumb move on your part but she also was a dick about it when u were clearly just trying to help", "NAH", "Shame man, you're sweet. NTA. It's a really nice gesture. Also shows you love and accept her exactly the way she is. Hormones, exhaustion and her own mental pressure probably erupted into tears. Not your fault.", "YTA why would you do that? Did she ask you to solve a problem for her? NO. \nPregnancy just does a number on the female body. Some say nursing helps you lose weight, ime it caused me to hold weight. It takes a long time for the body to recover, it is a hugely vulnerable place to be in, having given away control over your body to grow a child.", "YTA for not supporting your wife and trying to discourage her. She wants to lose weight and you are not listening to her needs. You are supposed to support her, not knock her down. Jeez.", "NTA, it's kind of you to try to make her feel better, but you should also keep in mind there's nothing wrong with her for wanting to lose weight. Her goal to fit into her old clothes (dresses, I assume) is a healthy goal. I don't know your wife so please take this with a grain of salt, but perhaps supporting her weight loss journey and complimenting her progress, would be of more help?", "NTA. You were kind and amazing. It's just that appearance,  weight and clothes are so incredibly emotionally loaded for many women that it's pretty close to impossible to convince a woman that she looks good if she feels like she is too big.", "NAH\n\nYou tried to make her feel better, but it didn\u2019t work. Honestly nothing is going to make her feel better about her body except a bit of time.\n\nOur society is so obsessed with \u201closing the baby-weight\u201d and \u201cbouncing back\u201d it\u2019s disgusting.\n\nBut honestly if/when I have to do that I know I\u2019m going to HATE how my body looks.\n\nIf you want to be more supportive try to see if she wants to take a new fitness class here or some sort of mommy yoga, and help watch your kiddo while she can do a bit of self-care/fitness.\n\nMaybe your wifey is the type to like a salon visit, but either way maybe there is something you can do that feels supportive for her, not because you care about her fitting into whatever outfits but because you love your wife and want her to feel beautiful and confident. You tried, and part of the journey is making a mistake like that, but you did the right thing by being open about it and not going behind her back.", "YTA. Just the idea of my significant other looking at my clothing sizes then taking it upon themselves to go buy me new clothes in a larger size sends my anxiety through the roof. You need to bow out of this one and just tell her she looks great. NOTHING  body specific.", "In no way is this him saying she\u2019s too fat. Literally he said the opposite. That it\u2019s ok to wear clothes that fit and she\u2019s beautiful no matter her size. She\u2019s just in a bad place mentally and not ready to accept help or kindness.", "I don\u2019t think he did the wrong thing. The wife is just in a bad place mentally. I would personally put my foot down more strongly about seeing a mental health professional. It\u2019s their business what they talk about together but I would insist on a couple of visits since her mental state is affecting everyday life", "This!", "YTA ''I know my wife would hate that but I did it anyway'' huuh?\n\nSomething silly like that can't fix self image issues, if anything you're sending the wrong message.", "She already feels self-conscious about her body. Now you've made her feel worse. Apologize to your wife. You didn't help. YTA", "NAH. You had the right intentions but weight loss after pregnancy isn't all about \"looking good\", it's also about regaining your bodily autonomy and start feeling like yourself again. In pregnancy your body changes noticeably very quickly outside your control, compared to gaining the weight over several years. So even if you still look good, it can be uncomfortable because you look down on your body and can't recognize it as your own. Your wife gave birth less than 3 months ago, and the body doesn't stop changing right after birth. If she used to be able to fit into these items of clothing, she knows how she used to look in them, now she sees herself with the same clothes but she looks different, and that can be very hard", "NAH You did a great thing by encouraging her to fit her clothes to her body, not her body to her clothes. The pressure on women to be as small as possible is crushing, and her reaction is based on that, not you. One thing: tell her she looks amazing both ways, not regardless of her size because it lightly implies that you\u2019re looking past the weight and not actively enjoying it. Trust me, the slightest unintentional implications become major when dealing with weight. Women are told we\u2019re too big everywhere we look, so it makes sense that she is looking for it with you, even though I\u2019m convinced you truly do not feel that way. Keep telling her she\u2019s beautiful and hot, and don\u2019t be discouraged if she doesn\u2019t seem to believe you. No amount of praise can instantly undo decades of internalized body shame.", "NAH and that was a super sweet idea and approach", "Oh how you've screwed up! It may in your mind have been a great thing. NO! Listen to your wife. SHE has to decide. Just stop doing crap that affects her self image WITHOUT ASKING FIRST. She's got enough stress.\n\nYTA", "Get your wife some POST natal vitamins. A lot of people don't know about them, which is unfortunate as they are extremely important as they replenish the vitamins and minerals that your wife lost during birth and after...\n\nNTA what u did was sweet.", "He didn\u2019t do what his friend said tho", "No he clearly sent a message to her that he thinks she\u2019s too big to wear the clothes she wants to. Which, right now, she is.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t want the other clothes. He could have given her a gift card instead of guessing her larger size.", ">In no way is this him saying she\u2019s too fat. Literally he said the opposite.\n\nThat was his intention, but because she's feeling really bad about her body right now, she perceived it as \"hey, I noticed you're fat!\"", "NAH, because it\u2019s obvious your heart was in the right place. But women have A LOT of standards we think we need to fit into, especially around baby weight. There\u2019s another post about a mom with an ED and possibly PPD, and was dieting and starving herself so much that her milk supply dried up and her baby was starving. Social pressure, mixed with baby hormones, mixed with mental health, she\u2019s struggling really hard right now. \n\nNever stop telling her how beautiful she is, how much you appreciate her even more now. Don\u2019t full equate her to being only a mom, but SHE is still beautiful, and that will never change no matter her size. If she\u2019s being unhealthy though, you need to worry about her and baby. I feel for her so much, and god I hope she gets better", "Your wife is probably feeling unattractive. Instead of doing all that, you go hyper on sex life man. Eat her up, or do whatever it takes to basically tire her out lol. When she complains and she will, then you say babe, you\u2019re so attractive to me that I couldn\u2019t help it. Try to make her feel beautiful in this way and she\u2019ll quickly overcome whatever her insecurities are.", "NTA but it\u2019s hard. good on you for actually getting her stuff. that\u2019s so kind and you had good intentions. If she wants, I found going on walks 4-5 days a week helped my twins through a sleep issue they had, helped with colic, i lost weight and felt much better about my body, and it helped clear my mind since staying inside all the time is hard on mothers especially with PPD/PPA", "NTA you were trying to help, and I think you went about it in a better way than your friend suggested. It sounds like she could really benefit from some therapy. Is she showing other signs of PPD? It can show up months after birth.", "NTA but perhaps your wife is having a hard time with the baby blues and hormones is making everything so darn emotional. Don\u2019t give up and be present for now."]}
