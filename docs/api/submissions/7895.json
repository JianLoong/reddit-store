I get you tried, but now you know not to go there.", "NAH you did the right thing by approaching her with the clothes instead of going behind her back, but shes most likely still pretty full of hormones, combined with what could be a post partum depression. There is nothing wrong with her aspiring to lose weight again, but if it affects other parts of her life too, she should consult a therapist.", "NAH. You meant well but your wife isn't an AH for how she feels.", "Ehh NAH, you tried your best but this definitely wasnt the best approach.. in her eyes you buying a bigger size means that you think she wont lose the weight...\nIts not just about extreme weightloss for her.. for more than 9 months (probably more now) she hasnt been in control of her body and hasnt felt comfortable in her body.. like this body isnt hers...\nBest thing to do is just support her in her journey now but keep emphasising that you love how she looks now.. untill she is ready to accept her new body", "NTA for trying to make her feel better about herself just unfortunate it didn\u2019t have the desired effect. Don\u2019t give up telling her she still looks amazing, November wasn\u2019t that long ago I\u2019m sure you are both still adjusting, it will get better.", "NAH", "NAH.\n\nYou saw that your wife was in need of something and you tried to provide it.\n\nBut post-partum stress, hormones, and weight issues are a deep well which no one who hasn\u2019t been through it can really fathom. Keep telling her and showing her how beautiful she is. Don\u2019t say ANYTHING about her weight, gains or losses, because no matter how you say it, right now, she will likely only hear it in a negative sense. If she wants new clothes, she\u2019ll buy them. Your goal right now should be to remove as much of the stress on her body and mind as you can. That may mean doing more than 50/50 on chores and baby care for right now.", "Your intentions were clear, you just wanted to support her. However, she took that as you saying she is too fat.\n\nNAH, but please just support her emotionally and actually assure her that you don't care about her weight. Either way, I hope your son is healthy.", "I wouldn\u2019t say YTA. You had good intentions BUT you executed incorrectly. Weight loss is a touchy and difficult subject for a lot of people especially women let alone women who have just given birth. \n\nYour wife most likely is struggling to love and accept herself and you buying her bigger clothes maybe triggered her which caused her to spiral. The best way to help is just ask what you can do. Reassure her she\u2019s beautiful but don\u2019t smother her about it. It\u2019s not healthy being obsessed with weight loss but if it\u2019s happening and she refuses to see a doctor the best you can do is encourage her to build healthier habits and support her so she\u2019s not doing anything dangerous behind your back. It will take time and patience but doing things behind her back will definitely not help. Good luck!", "NTA, but this is one of those things to just leave alone. Baby weight is a really sore spot with a lot of people.", "This is a difficult one, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s mad a you. Just mad at herself.", "YTA\n\nYou should have had enough emotional intelligence to figure out this was going to backfire. Your wife is an adult and knows how to buy new clothes, if that's what she wants.", "NTA that was a nice thing to do and she might appreciate it later on", "YTA, you never buy women clothes unless she specifically sends you to the shop for something. \n\nWomens clothing varies in size from shop to shop. It takes us years to figure out which places have clothing that fits the size you are trying to buy. If you are a size 10-12, there's no guarantee that the shop's size 10-12 will fit, you might have to go up 1 or 2 sizes & that just makes you feel like shit. You know to avoid those stores. (Topshop were notorious for much smaller clothing sizes).", "NTA. It was a kind thought and you meant well. That's all that really matters. She shouldn't really have said you're wrong for buying the clothes for her, but it sounds like she's struggling with a lot of emotions at the moment.\n\nRather consider whether she might need help for post partum depression, as there might be more than just the weight bringing her down. Not saying she definitely has PPD, but if she does, she could probably do with some help for that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Body image is a big issue for women, created by the bs societal expectations put on us.  Unfortunately hormones from pregnancy can make that worse.  During pregnancy women tend to already feel unattractive because of the changes our bodies go through, when that weight doesn't drop immediately after birth it's a hard blow to an already fragile self esteem caused by pregnancy, and again the bs societal expectations.  Your heart was in the right place, just the execution was wrong.  Maybe try the approach of telling her she's beautiful to you, but if she would like you'll start working out with her, walking together, doing yoga (yes guys can do yoga so save my the guys are too masculine for that nonsense), maybe go to the gym together, as a way to support, and help her.  She hears what you're saying, but maybe she's not feeling supported in her bid to lose the weight.  Give her that, and be earnest about it.  Don't just say it then not do it.\n\nI also recommend you suggest, GENTLY, that she talk to her doctor about PPD.  Good luck.", "Yta, although the thoughts are nice what your saying is she won\u2019t fit that size and here\u2019s a constitute.\nIf you want to be helpful maybe do family walks or make a healthy meal. Also personally I never lost weight until I stopped breastfeeding, I guess a hormonal thing.", "Soft YTA I get that you have good intentions but she's an adult, if she wanted to buy new clothes she would have done it herself", "NTA but I would never want my partner to buy clothes for me. Sizes are never the same for one and the couple of things my ex did buy me were nms. Clothes are so hard for women and you really need to try everything on both for size and to se how it looks. Even in the same brand sizes differ.", "YTA", "ESH. Dumb move on your part but she also was a dick about it when u were clearly just trying to help", "NAH"]}
