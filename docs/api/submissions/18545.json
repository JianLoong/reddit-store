You shouldn't have to tell your wife that it's almost your birthday to get her to give you a decent human treatment, that's so unreasonable. She shouldn't need an excuse like that to avoid treating you so bad, that's usually called respect and consideration. I hope she apologizes to you, and not bc of the birthday stuff but because u clearly don't deserve that attitude from her, having to deal with her bad mood must be exhausting", "NTA I literally have brain fog because of Lupus but I remember important dates, with the help of an online calendar on my phone, Facebook reminders etc. My parents have both died and I still remember their birthdays, all of my siblings birthdays including eight nieces and nephews.

Personally, I'd prefer they forget them all, not drag them out for a week!\n\nSounds like your sometimes-forgetful wife is trying to make herself feel better by shifting the responsibility onto you.

She should never need a reason to be nice. As for reminding her, that depends. I struggle with dates. I rarely know what day it is on any given day. And I don\u2019t remember my own birthday. Due to this, my partner always puts important dates on the calendar for me. And sets my reminders. It is not something I do intentionally or out of lack of caring. I literally just cannot remember. Yet I always celebrate him when I know his birthday is near. His reminders let me celebrate him like I want to. And he doesn\u2019t care, because he knows that I would miss my own birthday if not reminded. So maybe, just maybe, she needs that reminder. I would feel terrible if I missed his birthday. So he makes sure that I never feel that.", "NTA she sure is.  It\u2019s not up to you to remind her.  If it was that important to her she would have remembered.", "NTA.

I thanked him, gave him a kiss and proceeded to laugh my ass off about it. That was 4 years ago, I've tease him about  missing flowers in January ever since. He's just all I tried!

Not making a joke. Just trying to point out she may not be mean on purpose. A selfish person doesn\u2019t forget their birthday. She also isn\u2019t lazy. Wife and mother are huge titles to carry.

'I was an A-hole forgetting the birthday of the love of my life but I blame him for not reminding me for the date.'\n\nI admit that me and my significant other are not together for so long as you two, but I always make a big thing out of his birthday. I collect present ideas thoughtout the hole year and making a list of them when he says he wishes to have something. I write it down even if his birthday was last month. I buy his gift at least 2 weeks earlier to make sure it arrives and even if it has some issues I can change it. I bake a themed cake by myself that reflects something he really likes at the moment. (3 years ago he participated in an education programme for adults to get a heavy machinery operator's certificate, so I made him a construction cake. 2 years ago he was in love with oldschool Lada cars, and I made a racing cake. Last year he wanted a motorcycle so badly I made him a cake that actually looked like a motorcycle.) I always plan something on his birthday. If it's on a weekday then a fancy restaurant or something like that. If it's on the weekend something more time and effor comsuming. I always make sure we visit his parent (despite of me not liking them) close to his birthday and organise a party for friends to celebrate him. Each and every year. And we not even married. \nForgetting your spouse's birthday literally means you don't give a shit about them.\n\nEdit, because I forgot to add: Does she really need a special occasion to not be mean? Also if she knows she's bad at dates than she should use her damn phone and set up notifications. She has to deal with it once and setting it to remind her every year. What a terrible excuse.", "NTA. But your wife sure is. \n\nShe\u2019s admitted to being mean when she didn\u2019t need to be (she would have been nice if she remembered your birthday). Then she makes her forgetfulness your fault.\n\nDoes she own a phone? It has a calendar in it.

Yet even then, we BOTH managed to forget our fifth anniversary.", "This is the best attitude. Dates are really not all that important. That he thinks of you is what\u2019s important.", "Our wedding is the same date, I love Halloween. We celebrate every Friday the 13th. Which was his idea and what probably confuses him on the month sometimes. My birthday is close to your husbands too. \n\nI've forgotten my own damned birthday before, which is why I won't complain if others do.
