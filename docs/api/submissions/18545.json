You\u2019re right, your wife shouldn\u2019t have a special reason not to be mean. She shouldn\u2019t need to be reminded of your birthday either.", "NTA. If she is a forgetful person she can mark calendar or write down reminders. Being a forgetful person is clearly her problem. She is in a bad mood, she is treating you badly and now she is angry again bc you didn't say your birthday is coming? Weird.", "NTA Buy her a calendar for her birthday, maybe that will help in the future.", "It's somehow your fault she was in a bad mood and taking it out on you, because the person you've been with for almost 2 decades can't recall your birthday? Yea you're nta, she is the major ah. If she is legitimately forgetting these things she should be keeping a calendar", "NTA if you had brought up your birthday a la \u201cbe nice to me, it\u2019s my birthday in two days\u201d I\u2019m absolutely certain she would\u2019ve weaponized your statement and mocked you or gotten mean about you bringing it up. It\u2019s not cool how she treats you.", ">She said she wouldn't have been so mean if she remembered my birthday was in a couple of days as she tries to make that week special for me.

What a condescending jerk. \n\nNTA. Go treat yourself to some cake or something while she forgets it's your birthday.", "NTA. She has a phone in her pocket that can remind her of birthdays and important dates, she can be an adult and use it. Plus it sounds like she treats you like shit and takes her anger out on you, then blames you for making her do it... I was with a partner identical to that and I lasted 5 years of marriage before boiling over with resentment and dumping divorce papers on her lap. I have no idea how I even made it that long. But don't for a second believe that this is your fault or that you should have done better, that's what she wants. It's her fault she couldn't remember your birthday after 17 years together and her fault she can't figure out how to set reminders, and her fault for being such an A H to you.", "She sounds like a delight", "Absolutely NTA.  If she can\u2019t remember, that\u2019s on her.\n\nBTW having someone be extra nice to you one day a year isn\u2019t ideal.", "NTA, not even close. Birthday's are the same day every year and she's had 17 years to remember what date that is. It's not your fault she feels guilty for being an AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You shouldn't have to put up with 51 weeks of crap behavior for one good week.", "NTA this feels like some weird gender reversal. It's audacious that your wife is blaming you for not reminding her of your birthday.

Why would she be mean but then if it was birthday week be nice? Either there's something to be upset about or not.

You understand that she is forgetful and that shit happens and you do stuff and get told off for it.

I had a friend who would do that to me a lot and I definitely carry some emotional scars from it. \n\nIs this normal behavior for her? If this is really unusual there may be something else going on that she\u2019s taking out on you, like stress, pain or emotional/mental unwellness. It wouldn\u2019t excuse her at all, but if it were me I\u2019d kinda wish it was a fixable problem rather than a shitty personality", "Has she always been like this?

I\u2019m sure that OP would gladly never have a birthday again and have a nice, non abusive wife.
