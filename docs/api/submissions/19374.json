I don't want to spend hundreds of dollars to hang out with a bunch of drunk women I don't know (while sober), 3 hours from home. All of the activities include drinking in some way. So I declined the invitation thinking she'd be understanding...\n\nWell my SIL reached out to my husband/her brother (32M) to ask why I wasn't going. He was honest in saying that I wish I could be there but that I feel I'll be too pregnant to really have fun, and that we're trying to save for the baby. \n\nWell my SIL blew up saying just forget it, shes over it, and she doesn't even want to have a bachelorette party anymore. My husband tried to talk to her to see if something more was going on, but she's gone radio silent. \n\nI do feel bad as she came to my bachelorette party and is planning the baby shower for my husbands side of the family.

My husband tried to talk to her to see if something more was going on, but she's gone radio silent.\n\nYeah, this isn't about you. More than one person cancelled on her. You were just the latest to say \"yeah, maybe no to 24 hours of drinking in my 30s.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWow, WTH is wrong with your SIL? I've gone to and not been able to go to a lot of bachelorettes, and in no instance has the bride gone DefCon 1 over one person not being able to go - *ESPECIALLY* when that person will be in the third trimester.\n\nMy guess is you're not the first person to cancel, and doing a party 3 hours away is proving too much of a challenge. I am sure the other bridesmaids have their own lives/families and don't have the ability to go away for a weekend.\n\nYou can certainly tell your husband that if it's a night locally you're happy to attend, **if** you think that will smooth things over.\n\nBut this sounds more like \"straw that broke the camel's back\" and not a you-problem. Good luck, your first priority is your pg, not 6 hours of traveling and spending $$$ to watch other people drink.", "NTA, but I'm wondering if something else is going on, like maybe a lot of people are bowing out/arguing over her bachelorette party and that's why she wants to cancel it? Cause it really doesn't make any sense to me.", "Mostly NTA\n\nExcept, you should have told your SIL yourself, first. When the party came up and you realized you couldn't go, you should have reached out to her.", "NTA\nYour reasons for not going are totally legit. I would have told you, \"I'm disappointed you won't be there, but I totally understand. We should grab lunch a few days before or after.\"", "She was probably banking on you being there to spend money but not drink to cover the cost. NTA.", "Def not the asshole. Anyone who expects pregnant women to participate like they are not carrying around a growing human in their body is the a hole. Always do what\u2019s best for you first, being pregnant is no joke.", "NTA. Your SIL sounds really unreasonable. You are pregnant, period. Could your husband aka her brother talk to her in private? If there is more going on with her?", "NTA.  You should not feel guilty or second-guess yourself for prioritizing their health and financial stability. It is crucial to set boundaries and communicate limitations honestly, and it is up to the SIL to react respectfully and understandingly.", "NTA.  Just go see her.  If the BP was in town, would you go?  I'm a dude, but if I was pregnant I wouldn't want to go three hours away for that either.  If it were closer to home and you had some sort of issue, got overly tired (bc of the pregnancy), sick, or whatever at least you are HOME and not a Godfather movie away.  If she cannot understand that there is really nothing you can do.  If she wants to do it her way, she HAS to understand that some people just can't do it.  Your soul is clean on this one for sure.", "NTA. She\u2019s being unreasonable. Does she always have a tantrum when she doesn\u2019t get her way?", "NTA, she is. Your health (of course the baby's) comes first.", "NTA\n\nThat is a huge commitment for you unless you go there and spend the night at a hotel. 6 hours on the road for a pregnant woman? No thanks.", "NTA. Sounds like she\u2019s projecting all her feelings onto you. When things like these happen, I like to send text messages (after the fact), so both myself and the other person can literally look at what was said, and eventually see it was totally inappropriate.", "NTA.  I struggle to imagine why anyone who isn't in the bridal party is even invited to the bachelorette, nevermind such a linchpin that SIL doesn't want one if they can't go.\n\nI suspect this is all about passing costs onto you, but then, I tend to think poorly of histrionic inlaws.\n\nIn any event, for the rest of your pregnancy and at least the first year of baby's life, \"No thanks, I don't want that as a pregnant lady/new mom\" is a full and adequate explanation.  Don't be bullied into changing your mind, is my advice.", "NTA I think it's totally fine to sit out the bachelorette when you are 27 weeks pregnant.  Especially if you're going to attend other wedding events, so it's not like you don't care, it's just not an appropriate or healthy atmosphere for you, if it's all about drinking.", "NTA, but when you declined the invitation, did you actually reach out to SIL to explain? \n\nGiven that she reached out to your husband, it doesn't sound like it. And that's maybe the one thing I would've done differently in your shoes - talked to SIL personally before declining the invitation, and maybe planned a special dinner with her or something. \n\nAgain, I don't think you did anything wrong here - it's understandable why you wouldn't want to go. But given SIL's over-the-top reaction, it sounds like perhaps there's been some drama behind the scenes and this was the straw that broke the camel's back. It doesn't excuse her blowing up the way she did, but I do wonder if talking to her personally beforehand would've helped smooth things over a bit more.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you are throwing an event that isn't in the same town everyone lives in, you gotta expect people won't show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am assuming when you say \"other side of the State\" you don't mean Rhode Island...", "NTA\n\nShe wanted you there for some reason other than your company, or she would have been more understanding of your situation. Was she hoping for a designated driver?\n\nShe's obnoxious for throwing a tantrum over this. If she wants to take her toys and go home and not have a bachelorette party because you're not doing whatever she was hoping you'd do for her, that's entirely her problem.", "Based on comments, I\u2019m thinking that either SIL doesn\u2019t want it to be mostly older women (mom, aunts, future MIL) and wants more people her age. Or she was hoping OP would be the one to keep track of all of them/designated sober person because OP is pregnant.  I don\u2019t think SiL is going to be able to put words to it for a bit because she\u2019s also probably stressed with wedding stuff. NTA", "NTA-she probably want you there to chaperone. Lol", "NTA\n\nSounds like SIL is upset they're losing their designated driver! If they move it closer, enjoy the meals, and let them have their fun. You have no obligation to watch a bunch of people get hammered and babysit them for the night.", "NTA - Pregnant people get to do whatever they want as far as plans.", "ooooh SIL didn\u2019t want a fat pregnant woman in her wedding party, bet", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's probably a last straw because other people also declined or declined specifically because of the drinking/bars. A lot of people can't drink that much in their 30s/40s because medical issues start creeping in, people have kids, alcoholism, work, etc...", "NTA.

The AH is your SIL who expects a pregnant woman to show up to a bachelorette party where everyone will be drinking.  What kind of fun is that for you?  It sounds miserable.  Stand your ground.

You did the right thing, and this is his sister.

However if OP and Hubby are taking a week long getaway to some tropical destination, then I could see how SIL could feel upset. \n\nI still wouldn't classify OP as YTA, but additional context might be helpful.", "Is OP\u2019s baby shower three hours away? Bachelorette and bachelor parties are going way overboard nowadays. You can\u2019t make an event 3 hours away like that and get mad when people don\u2019t come.

I'd guess this is a non-USA thing because our shit family leave and the exorbitant hospital costs makes the idea of vacationing before birth the worst possible idea here.", "I guess. I'd imagine if that were the case it would be added in the details. To me, it sort of reads like \"WELL DID YOU INVEST IN SOLAR THIS YEAR?\" just a random question about your own finances which really doesn't align at all with the situation.", "It's definitely a USA thing.  I've known several people in the US that do these. When I was in Hawaii a few years ago, there were many pregnant women and their spouses on vacation, on their baby moon. \n\nIt's been a thing for the last 5 years or so.", "I think it's just a US thing. Because our leave policy sucks so much that you won't have any time off after the baby is born.", "Fair - it's not finances though really.

I'm over these destination bachelorettes.  Why can't people just go out for a night on the town? One evening, that is it. Not obligating people to pay for transportation and accommodation, after they have already committed time and money to be in the wedding party.", "NTA.

She\u2019s probably disappointed that you won\u2019t be there after she\u2019s done things to support you (gone to your bachelorette, is planning your baby shower) and I\u2019d guess that you\u2019re not the first person to decline and she\u2019s feeling frustrated.
