OP should complain to the HOA about squirrel/geese/birds shitting on their property.", "What are you talking about? If there were a fence around his yard, then the dog wouldn't be able to get on the lawn in the first place.\n\nAlso, in any neighbourhood I've ever lived in, it's understood that people walk their dogs and are expected to pick up after them.", "It is, mostly because of their food. Most dogs are fed processed dry dog food and it doesn't break down in the same way as the poo from wild animals.", "Huh. I don't have a dog and mowing my lawn, my shoes have never smelled like shit after mowing. \n\nWhen I was a kid at a friend's house my shoes every once in awhile would smell like shit after I accidentally stepped on a dog turd.\n\nIt seems all crap is not created equal.", "What? Have you only met constipated dogs before?", "My dog literally runs to the first grass she can see once she decides she wants to poop. It\u2019s usually mid-walk but she definitely doesn\u2019t stand around for several minutes. She goes when she needs to. I can usually redirect her if people have \u201ckeep off grass\u201d signs, but if someone doesn\u2019t have any kind of fence or sign, it\u2019s assumed that it\u2019s okay as long as you clean up after them.", "If my dog has to go, it has to go. If I pull him while he's shitting it will just be spread along the sidewalk.", "Then how is that going to stop a dog from crapping on my yard, or even worse, my driveway? I don't want dog shit caked to the underside of my car.", "No sidewalks here. See a few dogs everyone in awhile. Never had one crap in my yard. And I've been here for more than a decade.", "No, it\u2019s inconsiderate AF to make your dog another persons problem.", "Then it is now.", "Wild animal residue is not only left there but more likely to contain harmful pathogens and parasites.", "What am I talking about? I\u2019ve owned four homes in three different states and fence\u2019s don\u2019t mean squat. People still let there dogs poop outside the fenced in area, whether it be the front yard or the side of your property. And yeah, I live in a neighborhood where you would think that people are intelligent or courteous enough to pick up after pets and you know what? They\u2019re not. \n\nOne time I had a neighbor purposefully let his dog poop on my front yard. When his wife motioned for him to pick it up while she was handing him a poop bag, he literally pointed at my house and said \u201cfuck them\u201d. Never met either of them before that day. But I caught him in the act. \n\nI opened my front door and called him out. Needless to say, he picked up the poop and did the walk of shame. He even came back the next day and apologized profusely because he knew he was huge jerk and admitted as much. \n\nPeople will always show their true colors if they think no one is watching, or, they won\u2019t get caught.", "> Also, in any neighbourhood I've ever lived in, it's understood that people walk their dogs and are expected to pick up after them.\n\nAgreed.  The people saying NTA either have lived out in the country their whole lives or in apartments their whole lives and have no understanding of the realities of living in suburbia USA.", "You aren't going to smell dog shit from small smears that are left over from a picked up turd.", "I see my dog poop every day - sometimes twice! - and I almost always know when it\u2019s imminent. She does the \u201cpoop walk\u201d whether she\u2019s in my yard or out on a walk. Just like the dog I had before her and others before that.", "If you get shit caked to the underside of your car from a dog crapping in your grass & the owner picking it up within seconds, you got problems, buddy. & seriously, take a drive thru whatever neighborhood near you has picket fences so you can see how they fence the entire yard & not the driveway. Fence is attached to the house on either side of the driveway or there is a car gate across the driveway. Sometimes they leave it open on either side of the driveway, but that keeps dogs on leashes out of the yard... which is what this post is about. We aren't talking about strays.", "The dog owner is present to curb his dog. He should be able to find a suitable potty area.", "True, unless it's an incomplete pickup or it's the squirts.", ">The dog owner is present to curb his dog. He should be able to find a suitable potty area.\n\nHe did.  The yard.  Welcome to suburbia.  Don't like it, move back to the country or an apartment.  Don't let the HOA hit you in the butt on the way out.", "Your own yard, not someone elses. My neighbours understand this basic decency.", ">My neighbors understand this basic decency.\n\nYou know nothing about walking dogs.  They go when they go.  Maybe it's different in the Netherlands.  OP is in USA, judging by his behavior."]}
