It\u2019s a fucking dog lol I can\u2019t control every single thing it does.", "Right? One of my dogs is a ninja pooper. She gives zero indication that she's about to pop a squat, it's usually mid-stride and in the middle of the sidewalk.\n\nThe other one is a poop flight risk. She'll do like fifteen circles before pooping and you gotta keep your fingers crossed that nothing distracts her, or you have to go find another \"suitable\" spot (usually at least a block away from the first attempt) and start the spinning all over again.", "This is the law in most places in US. The town has an easement of a few feet in from the street. You don\u2019t own your land going all the way to the street edge.", "Someone once screamed at me to \u2018pick it up\u2019 as my dog was lifting his leg to piss on a bush. I simply have no idea how they wanted me to manage that situation.", "Yes im describing my american city experience. But there is a difference between letting your dog pee on the tree by the street on what is technically public and letting them pee in the bush right in front of the house. That would be unacceptable and id definitely say something too", "Yeah, it would be over here in germany too. But you have a lot of communal greens everywhere along the sidewalk. So there is no need to get into peoples lawns.", "Yeah but here in the uk most gardens have fences around them so dogs can't easily get in. From what I've seen of american suburbs quite a few of them are just open plots of grass without a fence which makes it harder to stop your dog from going kn the grass.", "I was a bit confused, surely a sign isn't needed to be aware not to let the dog go in someone's garden? Still gets picked up if they go on the pavement (or grass on the roadside if its there)\n\nAlthough OP is still the AH for escalating it so much.", "We're taking a lawn (that's grass and probably in the US) which is usually pretty shit near any road because of salt during the winter. \n\nI don't let my dog shit in someone's begonias, but when he has to poop, he has to poop. \n\nOPs extreme reaction when he could just turn a garden hose on the area (or better yet, build a fence if they have such strong TERRITORIAL feelings) is why TTAH.", "Same. Also from the uk.\nYou just don't let them walk on somebody elses land.\nPeople even put stuff in their gardens to stop free roaming cats from pooping.\n\nI don't understand all the Americans responding with yta. It's thier land.", "yeah I'm from Europe too and am quite astonished at the amount of people who thinks it's a-okay to have your dog shit and piss in someone else's garden XD.", "I'm in SC, USA, and I have a pretty mapped out route to walk my dog so that she doesn't do her business in someone's yard. Harder to do if you don't live somewhere fairly rural though. We're lucky enough to live in an area with a lot of undeveloped properties, old growth forests, and pastures so we just walk on whatever side is not as peopley. \n\nI think I've talked to my dog enough on our walks, and lots of praises when she does business where it doesn't matter, that she practically does it (not go potty in yards) on her own now. \n\nPlus, anyone who's had a dog long enough, can TELL when their dog is about to go a majority of the time. Circling a small area or intensely sniffing one spot, for example.", "Yeah, I\u2019m British, and I don\u2019t know anyone who lets their dogs shit on other peoples lawns. Like\u2026 that\u2019s THEIR property, control your animals for Christ\u2019s sake.", "In the US, front gardens are usually not fenced in at all. In some neighborhoods, there isn\u2019t any pavement and pedestrians either have to walk along the perimeter or someone\u2019s lawn or in the street. It\u2019s wild here.", "Exactly.", "So you invade someone else property that they paid/pay for? Train your dog better. A lot of countries won\u2019t even allow you to own a dog if it isn\u2019t trained and off leash. I went to Scotland and every dog would literally wait for owners outside the stores with no leash. People just let their animals do anything. To many irresponsible pet owners.", "But OP don't have grass, he has plastic turf. I have had dogs and they weren't allowed to pee on other people's fences, cars, houses, etc. And they also went for grass if needing to poo, but I would rather have them do it on the sidewalk and pick it up from there than on fake grass.", "Unless, by \"spikes\", he meant \"an impermeable half-bubble shield that completely covers every square inch of my property\", I can guarantee him that birds are still flying (and shitting) over his house and yard. (And if that is what he meant, I'm sure that shield is looking pretty gross by now.)", "Is anyone going to break it to OP that birds can actually fly over their lawn and shit on it? \ud83e\udd23", "\u201cIt\u2019s the outdoors. Sometimes there is poop\u201d. That should go on a t-shirt or a wood sign you buy at Michael\u2019s or something\u2026 maybe a coffee cup.", "I can tell when my dog is starting to do the searching for a place to poop walk, and I try to hurry her over to a patch of unoccupied land or somewhere easily scoopable, but yeah there's no way I'm gonna put that much effort into dragging her away from someone's yard if she's really got to go.", "That's happened to me. Guy yelled at me from an upstairs window, \"you gotta pick that up!\"   I just looked at the guy and asked, \"could you show me how to pick up piss?\"  This wasn't even this guy's yard, it was a dog rest area in an apartment complex.", "The flats and stuff around me just have communal greens in front with no fences and I still manage to keep my dogs off. It\u2019s just polite.", "It\u2019s weird that the default is no fence or sign means it\u2019s okay to shit here.", "Ah right - I\u2019d consider a lawn part of someone\u2019s garden tbh which might be unpopular.", "I get that, though I disagree because you're more likely to leave a smear behind on a sidewalk where people will step in it. Regardless though, it sounds like OP was aggressive over someone being perfectly responsible. Sure, they talked back a bit, but it doesn't sound like they were belligerent, and they picked up after their animal.\n\nIt would be different if there were a barrier or sign in place stating that dogs can't poop there, but barring that OP was way out of line for a first time confrontation.", "Not to mention, I\u2019ve pretty much never seen a cat deterred by *anything*", "Yep exactly, it\u2019s like landing a plane, we\u2019re generally aiming for tarmac but sometimes an emergency landing is needed lol"]}
