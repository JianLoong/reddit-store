And most of her friends are also physically attractive women as well.  And they like to party with rich men they meet.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for a couple of years. I make a decent living but I'm not NBA rich.  I don't have a trust fund. I'm not an tech millionaire.  I just make a very good salary and bonuses.  Enough to have paid of a good portion of my house and to have graduated without debt.  \n\nI want to retire young enough to enjoy my life so I invest and save most of my money.  Not all. I'm still enjoying my life now.  I am taking us to an all inclusive in Jamaica for New Year's.  \n\nBut she is jealous of her friends.  They get lavish gifts and they go out for dinner all the time.  \n\nShe loves me and we have plans for the future but she keeps bringing up all the things her friends get from their make admirers.  \n\nI finally snapped and said that I could not afford to be a sugar daddy.  She said her friends aren't like that.  So I pointed out that they literally do not make enough money to support the lifestyles they have.  I pointed out that one of them drives a $100,000 Lexus and she work part time at restaurant as a hostess. \n\nShe says that I'm calling her friends sex workers, which I would not do, and judging them.  So I asked her to explain how her friends afford dinner out at very expensive restaurants while earning minimum wage in some cases.  \n\nSo now she thinks I'm an asshole for making what I feel are apt observations.  \n\nShe asked if I consider her that way because I pay for everything and earn 6X what she does.  I told her no. That I'm proud to have a teacher for a girlfriend.  But she is still sulking.", "created_utc": 1669659887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z742dr/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_we_cannot/", "score": 1274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also pointing about that you can't afford to spend your money lavishly is not an asshole move NTA.", "NTA but she def is the TA. If she loved you or even liked you, she'd be more appreciative. You are an adult and you already know whether you want to be taken for granted. It's your decision at the end of day because it's your life. And you'll be the one living like this. Y'know make your bed and sleep in it.", "NTA but she is truly hinting at this left and right. She clearly wants expensive material items being handed to her like her friends. You are right in that she is jealous. If it continues, you might consider asking her what she wants more of in life.

She's equating material things with someone \"caring\" about her.   Her friends might not be sex workers, but they are definitely trading something that requires no effort for getting boons in life.  \n\nThey are what the Nice Guys and incels always complain about, and they are who give the rest of us a bad name.  I have no sympathy for them at all, their looks will fade, and if they don't have an education or career, their 100k-Lexus-as-sugar-daddy-present days will be a thing of the past.\n\nYour GF needs to grow up.  There's nothing to be jealous of.  If she wants expensive things, she needs to shuck her little buns and work for them.", "NTA. \n\nI think you may have reacted a bit more on this issue because it is grating on you that you aren't sure what her real priorities are. \n\nYou make a fine living and have a vision of the future when it comes to money. Your girlfriend seems focused on luxury items that aren't just out of your budget, but not something you are interested in. You want a partner, and her being jealous in this area makes you doubt she is a real partner, and probably what her motives are with you. \n\nI saw in the comments that she is a teacher and has paid for things before, albeit on the smaller side, but that is a good sign. I out earn my partner significantly so pay for the bulk of our dates/adventures, but he pays when he can and I appreciate that. On the other hand, she seems obsessed with the lifestyle of her friends and completely oblivious as to how they facilitate that lifestyle. You can point out how they get those items without judging them for it. \n\nMore importantly, she keeps pointing out all that they have, and you and she both know it comes from men. So by pointing it out, it does make it seem like she is expecting YOU to produce this stuff for her too. I'd absolutely point that out and make it an issue with my partner if he did that to me, repeatedly. She is now turning it back on you to escape you calling her out for it. If I tell my partner once a week \"Oh X's boyfriend is always taking her on dates, I'm so jealous\" I can't feign shock when he is like \"oh, you expect ME to do that for you?\" That's so passive aggressive, and you called it out and shouldn't feel bad for it. \n\nNow, you two do need to have an adult conversations about financial expectations if your relationship is going to progress.", "NTA. Your observations are very on point.\nJust out of curiosity, have you ever tried asking her to split a bill and see how she reacts? That may reveal what her true character is...", "NTA. \n\nI will say that this is one of those situations where y\u2019all need some counseling before marriage or etc. \n\nYou are not on the same page financially. You think long-term (paid off house, retiring early) and she lives for right now (dinner and gifts). \n\nEventually this will lead to resentment. I think she needs a new friend group, but I doubt she\u2019ll agree with that. \n\nAs for her friends, eventually those looks will fade (unless they have work done) and they\u2019ll have no career or etc and no way to keep up with the lifestyle they\u2019ve gotten accustomed to. \n\nAs a woman, I\u2019m envious of others too. I\u2019m a stay at home mom and we barely scrape by, so of course I\u2019m jealous of the moms driving a brand new Tahoe and living in brand new houses. But that\u2019s not my life. My husband is a good man and does what he can. I stay home due to health issues and is living in an area where childcare isn\u2019t easily available.

Also if those future plans include children your plans better include listening to your gf and your future kids complain about their lack of expensive things.

Run, don\u2019t walk, run away.", "NTA but why on earth are you still with her? She should be paying her fair share, it is insane to expect you to pay for everything. She should be paying her part in bills, but for her to throw a fit because she\u2019s jealous of her friends shows you her true colors. She doesn\u2019t really love you or she wouldn\u2019t behave this way. It\u2019s that simple.\n\nPlease get a prenup and do not put her name on your house if you were the one that paid for it.

I\u2019m a 22f if that makes me more or less of a valid source. What she\u2019s asking seems completely inappropriate I would have a discussion about expectations. If it were me I would feel undervalued given a sugar daddy doesnt provide what a real relationship does. Also given if she wanted to be rich she should have picked a career with a higher salary cap. Maybe have her look at what type of budget she could afford to have on just her own salary/ what kind of budget her friends would have to have without the men. May help her see where your coming from.", "You don\u2019t want to give up the arm candy. We get that. You might even love her.

Shes going to always compare you to their situations. Shes just as much a gold digger as they are. The Lexus situation you brought up is the perfect example.

You're nothing but a bank to her and she's already eyeing up bigger banks. I don't know why you made such a point about her and her friends being attractive. Sounds like you WANT one of these young gorgeous little gold diggers but can't afford it. Also her friends are sex workers, so she's wrong.

You've wasted so much time already, don't waste anymore.", "NTA - You called it like it is. And there is a huge difference between the two of you being in a long term committed relationship and her friends going out and partying with all these different rich dudes.

You should approach topics like sex and finances with more tact especially when you are trying to find middle ground with your partner.\n\nYou have pointed out an inconvenient truth to your girlfriend without tact but people usually don\u2019t snap without reason. You skipped the details pre-snap but I assume you calmly explained your financial situation when this first came up.\n\nIf all of the thing you said are true, sure, your girlfriend\u2019s friends are sugar babies. Their relationships clearly are based on financial transactions, especially if they don\u2019t have a problem with dating married men. \n\nNow your girlfriend is somehow equating your view on their relationship to your own relationship. Based on your post your spending patterns are more a reflection of your professions. It doesn\u2019t sound like your relationship is based on financial transactions.\n\nI understand you grouped up your girlfriend and her friends as physically attractive to illustrate that sugar daddy types of people would go after them. This understandably weirded out all the ESH and YTA voters because people usually don\u2019t choose their friends based on physical appearance. Friendships are based on shared things like hobbies or life goals. \n\nHere is the sad truth my friend, you are the average of your friends. Having low income is fine but why are all her friends sugar babies? My mom was a teacher and most of her friends were also teachers. What does your girlfriend have in common with a part time waitress who drives a 100k car and dates married men? In all likelihood she\u2019s more like her friends than you expect.\n\nWith only the information on your post I would advise you to cut your losses and break up with her. Two years might look like a lot of investment in the relationship to you now but people divorce long time spouses and go on to build a better life all the time. \n\nIf you think your relationship is salvageable, the friends need to go. You sound like you want to build a future where you have financial freedom. That\u2019s not gonna happen with the deadweight pulling you down.

If she really loves you, it wouldn't matter to her what you do or don't give her and what you can or cannot afford. She should appreciate  your generosity, not complain you don't give her enough. You do not want to get in any deeper with this little spoiled girl. BTW, I'm a woman. Sure, sometimes I wish my husband and I could afford some luxuries or a vacation to someplace far away.

I explained my background because I want to warn you. A lot of these girls who get things from wealthy men do things behind their monogamous partner's back to get what they want.

Soul-searching.\n\nWhat do you actually want, what does she want, and does that align? You're dating the kind of girl whose friends date professional athletes. That's... something. These are either her friends for life and actual peer group, or she'll outgrow them (as you grow together). If she doesn't outgrow them, you may not be compatible. But also do some deep soul-searching, truly, re: your needs/wants as well. You're barreling toward 30: do you want to date shallow young 20-somethings, or is it important to find someone who shares the same values, especially financially? A woman with her own career goals? (that's why I ask if she truly has them) You're entering a potential chasm where you may grow up but she doesn't. But... she may also meet all these needs; all you've said about her is she's beautiful and a teacher, and nothing of her other attributes or aspirations. She needs the Come To Jesus Talk, pt 2 to realize that if she isn't going to grow and be mature and manage her jealousy of her friends (or grow apart from them, potentially), you can't be together.\n\nBut honestly NTA for what you said.

They get lavish gifts and they go out for dinner all the time.  \n\nShe loves me and we have plans for the future but she keeps bringing up all the things her friends get from their make admirers.  \n\nI finally snapped and said that I could not afford to be a sugar daddy.  She said her friends aren't like that.  So I pointed out that they literally do not make enough money to support the lifestyles they have.  I pointed out that one of them drives a $100,000 Lexus and she work part time at restaurant as a hostess. \n\nShe says that I'm calling her friends sex workers, which I would not do, and judging them.  So I asked her to explain how her friends afford dinner out at very expensive restaurants while earning minimum wage in some cases.  \n\nSo now she thinks I'm an asshole for making what I feel are apt observations.  \n\nShe asked if I consider her that way because I pay for everything and earn 6X what she does.

Luxury vacations, cars, Cartier, etc. We broke up because frankly, I feel gross about all the surprise gifts since I do not want to feel like I have an obligation to someone because of a few trinkets. He got used to that lifestyle and level of spending for the next few years but then the cash stopped coming in. He quickly put himself $200k+ in debt (despite still having a decent six-figure income) and destroyed his credit. I am not saying this will happen to your gf's friends or their bf but it is a very slippery slope. If I were her and I actually like these people, I'd try more to be the voice of reason for her friends and try to convince them to invest more in themselves/careers/investment portfolios rather than waste time being jealous of something that could very well be temporary.  \n\n\nLastly, as someone who ran advertising for some of the biggest luxury companies in the world, I can share that we spend billions every year convincing people to buy shit they shouldn't.

When do you need to meet certain mileposts?  How do you each like to balance having things now vs knowing you'll have something later?

Do not just tell her what you want to do with your money, ask her what her priorities are and listen to her answers.

There's no shame in it.  \n\nBut be honest about it.", "They ARE sex workers if they are sleeping with people they wouldn\u2019t normally for the gifts, travel, dinners, etc.", "I think he said it more for context. I know girls from HS/college who would classify in same boat as his gf friends.

If your making 20,000 a year but doing things or owning items that cost hundreds of thousands and partying with rich men, it\u2019s a fair assumption on his end as his gf stated of \u201cthe things her friends get from their make admirers\u201d", "I understand the context: pretty women getting stuff from rich men.

What might OP do?", "Or a moral compass", "You need to tell her once again: \"This is what I can afford. I can't do any more.

When she is over I don't expect her to buy groceries.  And I don't expect her to pay for our more expensive outing like traveling broadway musicals and such.", "Yes. She pays for special dates that she plans ahead for.  She took me out to dinner for Mexican food at a place I never would have found.

You know your GF better than any of us. If you genuinely think it\u2019s just jealousy of her friends, suggest she gets therapy, otherwise she\u2019ll always think the grass is greener on the other side. If it\u2019s not material, it\u2019ll be something/someone else. It would be good for her to ditch those friends as well. All you can do is suggest though, she has to put in the work to change for herself. Otherwise, I\u2019d suggest rethinking this relationship as you seem to very financially responsible, and as someone who admittedly financially irresponsible she\u2019ll bring you down. The Joneses can\u2019t even keep up with the Joneses. Also, being a sugar baby is indeed sex work and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that as long as it\u2019s consensual, so if she\u2019s taking offense to that, there may be some internalized misogyny she may want to work on as well.", "And after she\u2019s spent a fortune on \u2018updating her look\u2019.", "Hmmm she doesn\u2019t but she feels bitter (with what she currently has) and compare you to her friends sugar daddies.
