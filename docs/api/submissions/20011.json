Hormones are a beast, the physical changes can be physically and emotionally difficult to deal with, and everyone and their dog feels entitled to judge every aspect of pregnancy. \n\nWith all that said -- I have to go with NTA on this one.\n\n>she started yelling at my brother for making her into a \u201cwhale\u201d.\n\nIf she was actually raising her voice, that is not cool. It's *double* not cool because I am assuming she consented to the marital act that resulted in the pregnancy. She's 50% responsible for making herself a whale. I don't think the occasional \"you did this!\" comments are the end of the world, but if it's an ongoing pattern of lashing out at him in front of you and other people, IMO that's taking it too far. \n\nSpeaking of which, if she's putting your brother on blast in front of other people, I also think *she's* the one putting the state of the marriage out there. It's a little rich to let the world know how pissed off you are with your husband and then cry about relationship privacy when other people comment.\n\nYour brother has made it clear where he stands, so you probably shouldn't comment on this again. But I don't think you were the AH for speaking up the first time.", "As a currently pregnant person, I can tell you that your pregnant SIL is using her hormones as an excuse to be cruel to her husband and you are NTA for standing up for him. I\u2019ve had maybe two arguments with my husband which were irrational and driven by hormones, but I felt immediate remorse and apologized and made amends. You don\u2019t turn into an out of control monster when you\u2019re pregnant, you just don\u2019t. You have moments where you feel overwhelmed and overstimulated and the easiest option is to lash out but that still doesn\u2019t erase consequences or remorse.\n\nAnyway, it was nice of you to speak up. I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t appropriately received.\n\nAlso, all pregnant people have stress. It\u2019s a symptom of being alive. Unless she\u2019s seriously high risk for something stress related, you\u2019re not going to hurt her or her baby by being honest one time.", "NTA I\u2019ve never in my life seen any friends or family of mine who\u2019ve had children treat their partner like that while pregnant. She is completely out of line and your family should be ashamed for treating you like that for defending your brother which they also should be doing. Your brothers spineless for lashing out at you like that", "I'm always suspect of people who post here saying everyone is calling them an asshole.

It was very much a hormonal thing, but that doesn\u2019t make it ok.\nShe once yelled at him for getting her normal fries instead of curly fries and then yelled at him again when he went back for curly fries because it took too long. I called her out on it and said she was overreacting and he was doing something nice for her (in gentler terms though). She would take a few minutes to breath and then she\u2019d always give him a genuine apology.", "NTA. Mom of 2. There's no reason to act like that CONSTANTLY. Both my pregnancies were high risk and everything that it comes with. There's a certain way to act. And that's not it.", "Info - when you say lashing out, what do you mean? What is she saying while yelling at him? \n\nI'm not sure this changes my judgement, but I'm definitely curious, lol", "NTA\n\nYour brother is being verbally abused. This hormone thing is BS. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean she can abuse people, especially not the father of her child. She needed someone to tell her that her awful behaviour is not okay.", "NTA. If shes doing this stuff now, for a joint decision, just imagine what she's gonna try to do to the kid. My guy you need to get her into some counseling or something. This is not normal behavior at all.", "NTA. Pregnancy is difficult but it's not a free license to treat people like crap. You stood up for your brother and did it sensitively by speaking to her in private. I would stand by what you did while also stating that you will respect his wishes and won't try to intervene in the future.", "NTA and shame to everyone for supporting that B. How can she yell to him Infront of everyone? What an audacity. If I was you I would shut her down right there, you were too kind to talk to her in private, someone has to stop this abusive behaviour.", "Assuming you asked her tactfully and since she appeared to be ok with it, you couldn't know she'd start crying. Not an AH then, but maybe naive about having a positive outcome.\n\nIt could be hormones, or it could be she just enjoys the reassurance she gets from everyone around her. \n\nIt feels like a ridiculous statement for her to make, but if your brother is upset, maybe an apology for the sake of family relations is worth it.", "NTA. A lot of people are completely oblivious to how hurtful they're being when they think they're being playful or funny. You SIL needed to be told that she was being hurtful. Since you were gentle about it and spoke to her in private you weren't out of line. Your brother asking you not to speak up again isn't shocking though. A friend of mine has a similar situation. Her partner would be unkind or put her under a lot of stress but would break down in tears once she asked him to stop (and make her comfort him). So your brother is stuck either taking the verbal abuse or having to comfort his wife when she was the one being hurtful. In the future, I would try reaching out to your brother so you can support him and make it clear he doesn't deserve to be treated like that even if the pregnancy is making his wife behave out of the ordinary.", "NTA - tell your brother that they can stay home; and not to come crying to you for babysitting.", "This one is tough.  Being pregnant doesn't give people permission to treat others like A-holes.  However your hormones are going haywire...but still...the golden rule ALWAYS applies. What you should have done is talked to your brother first.  Just letting him know that you support him right now probably would have meant the world to him.  I think you taking up for your brother is admirable.", "INFO - Did your brother actually make her into a whale  as she put it, or not?\n\nScratch that, NTA. Quite frankly, yelling at your brother was uncalled for on her part. I feel sorry for your brother for putting up with her  even if he did tell you to stay out of his marriage.\n\nEdit: Reread post, performed judgement.", "NTA - assuming SIL is carrying a planned and wanted baby, she's 50% responsible for however she's feeling about her changing body.  Yelling at her husband isn't going to make her feel any better, and it certainly isn't going to help their marriage.", "NTA.  I get tired of people coddling pregnant women like they have no agency and are made of glass. She's rude and everyone plus her hubs is doing her zero favors by doing so. What's next, his fault if she tears or has to have a c section? His fault if the baby weight doesn't slide right off after birth? His fault for her stretch marks? When does it end?", "Be veeeeerrry careful here. When you see \"pregnant woman seems irrational and always upset at my poor brother\", you may not be seeing the whole picture. \n\nI say this because abuse often starts, or escalates in pregnancy. Because pregnant women often are neglected by men who think they have no responsibilities until the baby arrives. Guys who maybe still go out drinking or drugging every night, who say to their partners, \"it's you, not me, who's pregnant\". Who go to their families looking hangdog and saying how this woman is so *unreasonable and irrational and controlling* for asking him to do anything. \n\nI'm not making any calls about this situation. Maybe she is really just being an AH. But I am saying, it's very easy to call these situations wrong, and a pregnant woman who seems to be constantly freaking out may actually need support, not judgement.", "NTA send this post to your brother and family harassing you, obviously not SIL", "NTA", "I\u2019m wondering what SIL means by \u201cmaking her a whale.\u201d OP says her family is really excited about this baby.

That\u2019s a pretty painful thing for me to even read. I\u2019ve put myself on the line for other people plenty of times. That is one way I\u2019ve learned that survivor-centered responses to abuse are the only way to go. It\u2019s disempowering to have people act as your proxy, and it can even worsen abuse. There is not a one size fits all response."]}
