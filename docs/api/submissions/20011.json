Hormones are a beast, the physical changes can be physically and emotionally difficult to deal with, and everyone and their dog feels entitled to judge every aspect of pregnancy. \n\nWith all that said -- I have to go with NTA on this one.\n\n>she started yelling at my brother for making her into a \u201cwhale\u201d.\n\nIf she was actually raising her voice, that is not cool. It's *double* not cool because I am assuming she consented to the marital act that resulted in the pregnancy. She's 50% responsible for making herself a whale. I don't think the occasional \"you did this!\" comments are the end of the world, but if it's an ongoing pattern of lashing out at him in front of you and other people, IMO that's taking it too far. \n\nSpeaking of which, if she's putting your brother on blast in front of other people, I also think *she's* the one putting the state of the marriage out there. It's a little rich to let the world know how pissed off you are with your husband and then cry about relationship privacy when other people comment.\n\nYour brother has made it clear where he stands, so you probably shouldn't comment on this again. But I don't think you were the AH for speaking up the first time.", "As a currently pregnant person, I can tell you that your pregnant SIL is using her hormones as an excuse to be cruel to her husband and you are NTA for standing up for him. I\u2019ve had maybe two arguments with my husband which were irrational and driven by hormones, but I felt immediate remorse and apologized and made amends. You don\u2019t turn into an out of control monster when you\u2019re pregnant, you just don\u2019t. You have moments where you feel overwhelmed and overstimulated and the easiest option is to lash out but that still doesn\u2019t erase consequences or remorse.\n\nAnyway, it was nice of you to speak up. I\u2019m sorry it wasn\u2019t appropriately received.\n\nAlso, all pregnant people have stress. It\u2019s a symptom of being alive. Unless she\u2019s seriously high risk for something stress related, you\u2019re not going to hurt her or her baby by being honest one time.", "NTA I\u2019ve never in my life seen any friends or family of mine who\u2019ve had children treat their partner like that while pregnant. She is completely out of line and your family should be ashamed for treating you like that for defending your brother which they also should be doing. Your brothers spineless for lashing out at you like that", "I'm always suspect of people who post here saying everyone is calling them an asshole.

It was very much a hormonal thing, but that doesn\u2019t make it ok.\nShe once yelled at him for getting her normal fries instead of curly fries and then yelled at him again when he went back for curly fries because it took too long. I called her out on it and said she was overreacting and he was doing something nice for her (in gentler terms though). She would take a few minutes to breath and then she\u2019d always give him a genuine apology.", "NTA. Mom of 2. There's no reason to act like that CONSTANTLY. Both my pregnancies were high risk and everything that it comes with. There's a certain way to act. And that's not it.", "Info - when you say lashing out, what do you mean? What is she saying while yelling at him? \n\nI'm not sure this changes my judgement, but I'm definitely curious, lol", "NTA\n\nYour brother is being verbally abused. This hormone thing is BS. Just because she's pregnant doesn't mean she can abuse people, especially not the father of her child. She needed someone to tell her that her awful behaviour is not okay.", "NTA. If shes doing this stuff now, for a joint decision, just imagine what she's gonna try to do to the kid. My guy you need to get her into some counseling or something. This is not normal behavior at all.", "NTA. Pregnancy is difficult but it's not a free license to treat people like crap. You stood up for your brother and did it sensitively by speaking to her in private. I would stand by what you did while also stating that you will respect his wishes and won't try to intervene in the future.", "NTA and shame to everyone for supporting that B. How can she yell to him Infront of everyone? What an audacity. If I was you I would shut her down right there, you were too kind to talk to her in private, someone has to stop this abusive behaviour.", "Assuming you asked her tactfully and since she appeared to be ok with it, you couldn't know she'd start crying. Not an AH then, but maybe naive about having a positive outcome.\n\nIt could be hormones, or it could be she just enjoys the reassurance she gets from everyone around her. \n\nIt feels like a ridiculous statement for her to make, but if your brother is upset, maybe an apology for the sake of family relations is worth it.", "NTA. A lot of people are completely oblivious to how hurtful they're being when they think they're being playful or funny. You SIL needed to be told that she was being hurtful. Since you were gentle about it and spoke to her in private you weren't out of line. Your brother asking you not to speak up again isn't shocking though. A friend of mine has a similar situation. Her partner would be unkind or put her under a lot of stress but would break down in tears once she asked him to stop (and make her comfort him). So your brother is stuck either taking the verbal abuse or having to comfort his wife when she was the one being hurtful. In the future, I would try reaching out to your brother so you can support him and make it clear he doesn't deserve to be treated like that even if the pregnancy is making his wife behave out of the ordinary.", "NTA - tell your brother that they can stay home; and not to come crying to you for babysitting.", "This one is tough.  Being pregnant doesn't give people permission to treat others like A-holes.  However your hormones are going haywire...but still...the golden rule ALWAYS applies. What you should have done is talked to your brother first.  Just letting him know that you support him right now probably would have meant the world to him.  I think you taking up for your brother is admirable.", "INFO - Did your brother actually make her into a whale  as she put it, or not?\n\nScratch that, NTA. Quite frankly, yelling at your brother was uncalled for on her part. I feel sorry for your brother for putting up with her  even if he did tell you to stay out of his marriage.\n\nEdit: Reread post, performed judgement.", "NTA - assuming SIL is carrying a planned and wanted baby, she's 50% responsible for however she's feeling about her changing body.  Yelling at her husband isn't going to make her feel any better, and it certainly isn't going to help their marriage.", "NTA.  I get tired of people coddling pregnant women like they have no agency and are made of glass. She's rude and everyone plus her hubs is doing her zero favors by doing so.

When does it end?", "Be veeeeerrry careful here. When you see \"pregnant woman seems irrational and always upset at my poor brother\", you may not be seeing the whole picture. \n\nI say this because abuse often starts, or escalates in pregnancy. Because pregnant women often are neglected by men who think they have no responsibilities until the baby arrives. Guys who maybe still go out drinking or drugging every night, who say to their partners, \"it's you, not me, who's pregnant\". Who go to their families looking hangdog and saying how this woman is so *unreasonable and irrational and controlling* for asking him to do anything. \n\nI'm not making any calls about this situation. Maybe she is really just being an AH.

Idk, my husband and I hurl insults at each other back and forth sometimes, but we are just kidding and always mean it with love.  Idk.. I can't help but wonder if OP is protecting here. When she reads her brothers expressions as stressed it just makes me wonder if she's seeing something that isn't actually there.  Like of all the ways for a wife to be shitty to her husband, or being verbally abusive, dramatically and loudly whining \"you made me faaaat\" just seems kind of weak if that's literally the only proof she has. \n\nAt worst, the \"you made me into a whale!\" Comment is self-derogatory.  It's not actually insulting the husband.  If this woman is as awful as OP makes her out to be, she should have waited for one of those more obvious moments to speak up and defend her brother.  Choosing to die on the hill of \"you're being rude to my brother by saying he made you fat!\" Is pointless because calling yourself fat isn't that much of an insult to someone else.  It's whiny and childish, yeah.. but still.. surely there are better moments to make a thing out of this over? \n\nJust mentioning this because we are only getting OPs side of the story, and this is just so so weird to me that a comment like \"you made me into a whale\" could be a source of such great stress for someone.  I mean if she was saying other things too, like \"I hate you for doing this to me\" or otherwise actually berating/belittling the guy (\"you didn't get me the right pillow, you can't do anything right!\") I'd be all with everyone.. but by itself... It's just not enough to get worked up over.  If OP has other examples of this woman being not so great, examples she for whatever reason chose not to include here, I think those would have been better times for her to speak up and stick up for her brother.  Because by itself I do think it's possible OP overreacted in this situation and the brother's reaction does seem to indicate that too, which is why I'm leaning towards YTA .", "Yeah, there is NO excuse for that kind of repeated verbal abuse.

Maybe she's really struggling to eat enough to keep the baby healthy because of the screaming voice in her head telling her the world will end if she gains weight. \nOr maybe she has a physical or mental health problem exacerbated by pregnancy, like anxiety about dying in childbirth. People imagine anxiety like a panic attack or something.

Insane demands, massive entitlement and all sorts of outrageous behaviour. \n\nWent on holiday with three other couples to a massive house we ranted, the couple I only knew in passing had the wife who was one if these. Tried to change what everyone did on holiday to what she felt like. Ended up having a tantrum over eating all the chips she liked and that we didn't have any more. So took another couple's car/van, which was the biggest car (held more people and stuff) and drove back to the place to get more. Hid the keys, so we had to do multiple trips with the other cars to get everyone and everything back (including two of her kids she left there). Claimed it was her hormones, but everyone called bullshit and she cried. The women were more pissed as all had been pregnant before. \n\nSome people realise they have power due to things and abuse it. The woman I went on holiday with had been apparently acting like that for months, but the husband was just called an arsehole and uncaring for saying anything. Until she got called out by multiple other people including people who had been pregnant, so her usual bullshit about being a man and not knowing how hard pregnancy was didn't work. \n\nOutside of that holiday she had always been a really lovely person. \n\nThe whole hiding the car keys and refusing to say where she put them was proof she was just being am arsehole.

I was home alone, and was afraid I'd burst something if I tried as hard as I could. But i love quince jelly just as much now, 42 years later.

I still dislike him several years later.", "You are completely incorrect. That's not how pregnant bodies work at all. \n\nThousands of years ago, a pregnant woman was more vulnerable to starvation or predation because they're less mobile than they normally are. They're more susceptible to illness and bacteria. Not only that, their body will starve the fetus if it has to in order to survive, wasting all the resources already invested in the offspring. \n\nThen they give birth and not only are they *really* less mobile now, they have a completely defenseless offspring that needs constant care and nourishment directly from the mother's body. \n\nWomen evolved to crave extra fat and carbs in general, especially during pregnancy and instinctually pack on as much fat as possible for the coming times when they will be more vulnerable and less mobile. They evolved that way because the ones that didn't starved to death with their babies or got eaten while looking for food, or all their babies starved from lack of milk because the mother's body didn't have the nutrients to spare and the genes died with them. \n\nJust because we live in modern times without predators, less food scarcity, and extremely unhealthy foods doesn't change the biological urge to eat that thing your body tells you that you need. It doesn't stop your body screaming that it's starving even when you know it's not. And it doesn't stop your body from working as hard as it possibly can to store every calorie it possibly can for later. Your body doesn't know the difference between 2023 and 10,000 bc. \n\nLeave the pregnant women alone, they're already going through hell without you acting like it's the equivalent of sticking a giant water balloon in your shirt. There's so much more that goes into creating a human.\n\nEdit- edited to save the souls of pregnant women everywhere \ud83e\udd23", "The \"reading Proust\" almost took me out, lol. You have impeccable taste though.", "Reading some other replies, it seems the rage is strong in a lot of pregnant women. I was perhaps a bit unusual, living in a large homemade tent on a riverbank when I got pregnant. when I realised it I just kept doing what I was doing, then went to see a doctor at about 5 months. I had no expectations of pampering, and was only concerned about improving my diet a bit and stopped my MIL from buying any synthetic babyware.", "They're not excusing the behavior or saying that everyone should bite their tongue, they're explaining that just because that person's experience with pregnancy was X, doesn't mean that pregnancy can't also cause Y experience. \n\nI have my own set of issues, and pregnancy for me resulted in near constant rage and hate unless I was with certain people that I found calming and safe. It wasn't under my control, I didn't choose to feel that way, when I lashed out and said something mean, I immediately felt awful and broke down apologizing, but it doesn't change that I wasn't in full control of what I was feeling or saying. \n\nAnd in the time it was happening, I didn't even realize that this wasn't who I was mentally. It wasn't until right after birth when I could tolerate my mother calling me or my husband blowing his nose that I could look back on my feelings during pregnancy and realize that I had been nuts before. I didn't realize that those things were the absolute crimes they felt like they were in the moment. \n\nIf I had realized or if someone had mentioned to me or my doctor that I was acting extremely out of character, maybe I could've gotten help and not been a menace for the last 4 months of my pregnancy, but I couldn't see it and no one else said anything until I was back to myself. \n\nI think OP was right to say something, but I don't think the SIL is evil or using her pregnancy as an excuse to be abusive, she may very well really need help.", "That is YOUR experience. It's great that you're always able to control your behaviour despite all those factors. It's not the case for everyone. \n\nI'm responding to someone who implied anyone who behaves poorly in pregnancy is choosing to use it as an excuse to be cruel. This is not true. I'm completely sick of people representing the way THEY experienced something as the way it is for everyone, and saying anyone who had it differently is lying and 'using it as an excuse'.\n\nI'm telling you, because it's my job so I know and I've seen it, the physical / emotional / mental / hormonal impacts of pregnancy are such, that in certain susceptible individuals they make people become so incapacitated they have to be hospitalised, or cause people to kill themselves, or their babies. So yes, some people can become inappropriately angry during pregnancy and struggle to manage it, and then be perfectly nice, loving, good partners again afterwards.

Why do you simply assume that?\n\nFrom reading not only the post but your responses, you seem very confident that you know all about their situation, even though it's painfully obvious you only know his side of any story. Have you talked TO HER about any of this? Or did you just have a good yell at her because you assumed your brother was in the right, without even asking your SIL for her side?", "They may not realize it\u2019s an actual medical issue (hello stereotypes about unreasonable pregnant women) or they may be keeping that information private.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t fault you for going to your brother and expressing your concern *for your SIL\u2019s wellbeing* and suggest they might talk to her OB about antepartum rage/depression because she is acting very out of character. \n\nBut 1. this should come from a place of concern for SIL, not shaming her, 2. you\u2019ve already been told to butt out once, so you need to respect their response if they tell you to mind your business and 3. you should address it with your brother, not SIL. \n\nShe will likely go back to normal once the baby is born, or maybe a few weeks or even months after. I\u2019ve heard many women who suffered from antepartum mental health issues say they felt better soon after the baby was born. For me I didn\u2019t have any antepartum issues, but my hormones were completely wacky for about three months postpartum. Everyone is different.\n\nMany women also report intense dislike of or even disgust with their partner during pregnancy that resolves shortly after the baby is born. I saw another commenter suggest that her not wanting him at the hospital is probably indicative of DV and that is not necessarily the case. Some pregnant women just flat out don\u2019t like being around their partners while they\u2019re pregnant. It could be that this is the case and SIL and your brother have discussed this and they\u2019re doing their best to manage the situation.\n\nBottom line, probably good reason to be concerned, and you wouldn\u2019t necessarily be *way* out of bounds to suggest bringing it up to a medical professional. But at the end of the day there\u2019s a lot of possible explanations for the behavior, and if you\u2019ve been told to butt out by your brother, you need to respect that.", "I don\u2019t think she is as sweet as you think.

A lot of us experience symptom relief during pregnancy. It\u2019s often misdiagnosed as depression, bipolar, and borderline, so if she has any of those diagnoses it\u2019s worth considering. \n\nWhat makes it PMDD is that symptoms only occur during luteal and disappear once menstruation starts.
