It was an accidental pregnancy. I honestly don't know how it happened because we used condoms and none of them broke. We had been together for 1.5 years and had moved in together 2 months prior.\n\nBefore we got pregnant, his position on accidental pregnancies was that he would want to keep the baby because he eventually wants to have a family and he doesn't think he would feel right about terminating. My take was, \"let's cross that bridge when and if we have to.\" To my surprise, I felt very strongly that I wanted to keep the baby as soon as I found out I was pregnant. Alex was shocked and became withdrawn. \n\nWe were supposed to go together to my first ultrasound at 8 weeks but Alex didn't show up. I tried calling and texting him before I went in but I couldn't get through. Unfortunately, at the appointment I found out that our baby didn't have a heartbeat. I tried calling Alex again after the appointment but still couldn't get through. I went to his work to try to find him (crazy, I know) and his coworkers told me he had taken the day off. I went back to our apartment and found all his stuff gone and a note on the kitchen counter saying that he would pay child support but not to contact him until I had the baby.\n\nI was obviously heartbroken, not just from the breakup but also because the miscarriage left me feeling empty inside. I didn't bother trying to contact Alex at all.\n\nA few months later, I ran into Alex's brother Carl at a bar. Carl confronted me about having an abortion (Carl, unlike Alex, is religious and militantly pro-life) because I was obviously not pregnant. I told him that my pregnancy was none of his business. The next day, I got a call from Alex. He asked me what happened and, when I told him, he lost it. He told me he had been been so stressed about being a dad and that I should've told him I miscarried. \n\nObviously (at least it's obvious to me) Alex is an AH but was I an AH by not telling him I miscarried? I felt justified at the time but lately I've been feeling guilty.", "created_utc": 1692296822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tvhsi/aita_for_not_telling_my_ex_that_i_miscarried/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
