Unless there is an actual risk of bodily harm then let them go!\n\nAnd MIL can hush about such outdated things as there no boy Barbie\u2019s. Isn\u2019t Ken a boy Barbie. I remember using my brother GI Joe to marry off to my Barbie or whatever I did with them. \n\nMy brother and I ended up meshing all our toys into massive race tracks and train tracks through villages made of Lego, smurfs, Barbie\u2019s, superhero\u2019s etc. we used to make amazing tracks that Mum and Dad had to step over in the Rumpus Room to get to the garage to go to work.

Your MIL wants your daughter to be nice and compliant and go along with what the boys want to do over what she wants.  Fuck that shit.\n\nAlso, Ken is a boy Barbie.  Your MIL is sexist and she's trying to squash your daughter down. You did the right thing and you don't owe her an apology.", "NTA, no apology required.

Instead of walking out of the room, calling your sister out of the room, and calling an older lady \"delusional\". I don't know if this was before or after she called you \"mean\" and \"disrespectful\", so you may have been provoked, I get it -- but when someone gets you to lose your temper, YOU LOSE. \n\nThe SIL should mind her own business. Your husband should stay out of it too, he wasn't there. Your sister should do what she feels is right for her. \n\nThis is your issue to resolve, and that's your MIL.
