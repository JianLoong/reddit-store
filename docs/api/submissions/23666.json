Hopefully this embarrassment will make her think twice before she tries it again.", "NTA the reason people like this continue to be self absorbed dicks in public is because people would rather let it go instead of a confrontation. If they were shamed for it and made to explain their thought process on why they think it's acceptable behavior, they are less likely to do it again, lest they end up looking like an ass and having to actually deal with it rather than walking away with their head held high.

My rationale being, firstly, she's old and belongs to an entirely different generation with different experiences and values. Secondly, I don't want to model lashing out in anger to a child, especially towards strangers; this has the potential of putting them at risk of harm in the future. Thirdly, as you said, she might not even have heard the comment.\n\nWhat I would have done would be to ask the child if she heard the comment, then teach her how to properly handle or process the comment (btw I understand that at 3 she might be too young to successfully do this, but hey).

After the woman left, we moved on to the next section of the store and started talking about other things.\n\nIn terms of supervision, she\u2019s a good kid, and knows my rules while shopping are that she needs to be walking right next to me, holding onto the cart, or riding in the cart, so she was just holding onto the cart which put her within arms reach of me. She definitely heard the interaction we had, but was busy looking at the different characters on the box and then crossing things off my shopping list (which I like to put her \u201cin charge\u201d of as she loves to help).
