They both daily go to the same study centre to study. They spend a lot of time together almost daily. Often in order to take breaks from their books they go for drives or just go out to eat something.\n\nNow, I really get along well with the best friend. He's an amazing guy. And they both have taken me too once or twice with them to just hangout and get something to eat.\n\nThe thing is, my BF has been very busy because of his studies nowadays and we don't meet as often as we used. Which is not a problem at all. The problem arises when he decides to take a break and still hangs out with his best friend who has been with him almost the whole day instead of me whom he meets just once a week (sometimes maybe less).\n\nAs they are neighbours they hangout at each other's houses anytime they want to and till however late they want to. Many times I'd call him to just talk for a minute or two, knowing that he'll be at home and I won't be disturbing him, and I find that yes, he's at home but his best friend is with him. So I'm unable to get even that little time.\n\nThis past one week has been really stressful for me at my house and I've been wanting to get out of the house for some time. I've been asking my boyfriend to hangout with me since 3 days and he's been busy. Today, also the same thing happened. And I was fine with it. Then I called him in the evening just to talk randomly and I could clearly hear traffic noises in the background. I asked him what he was doing and he replied with \"nothing\". Then after a minute or so I again asked him if he was out somewhere. Then he told me he's out with his best friend to eat something at a new place that has opened. I asked him why he told me that he won't be able to meet me. And his excuse was that they both had coupons for the new place and those coupons were about to get expired.\n\nI was genuinely pissed. I was more hurt at the fact that he was lying to me than the fact that he was with his friend. I got mad at him. And just disconnected the call. I later texted him telling him that I was hurt and I'm angry. He just replied with \"Okay\". He hasn't apologized or even tried to talk to me about it again.\nI don't know what to make of all of this. AITA for being jealous of their proximity?\n\nEdit : I just got to know that he's having ice cream with his best friend right now. Its 1 am. And I've been asking him to go for ice cream since a week.", "created_utc": 1680377217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128w2dj/aita_for_being_jealous_of_my_23f_boyfriends_25m/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You may need to have a frank conversation with him about that and see what he tells you. If he apologises profusely and tells you the whole truth then maybe ya'll can stay friends, though only do that if mentally and emotionally able to,  but he has to be honest first.

Or did you make this relationship up in your head.", "NTA - he's prioritising his friend over you. Yes, his friendships are important, but making time for a relationship is also important - and he isn't doing that.
