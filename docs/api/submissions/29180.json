It's an emotional thing for her, understandable a bit. Don't engage with it now, it's raw. Don't change your plans. She needs to work through her feels and anything that has a tie to the hospital will be problematic.\n\nEnd of the day her demand is unreasonable and well outside the scope of her rights as a mil. But it's a fight you would be well served to kick down the road.", "Nta. People deserve medical care, they deserve people that care about their medical care. Would she prefer that hospital was defunded, because of this incident? How many other times have they had excellent treatment there? Sometimes people need someone to blame, but you don\u2019t have to be the vessel that carries her hate. Make your decisions based on what feels right to you.", "NTA. Perhaps tell her that you want to improve the quality of care at the hospital and ensure that nothing like what happens to your FIL happens on your watch.", "NTA\nI completely get her being upset over this but she can not control where you work. You have to think of your family and finances. If she truly believes the hospital is to blame, she could get legal advice and see what her options are. She should also get some counseling. That\u2019s terrifying for her I\u2019m sure to see her husband in that state.

What about your husband?", "I\u2019m sorry to hear about the loss of your FIL.   \n\n\nOf course you\u2019re NTA and you already know it. Luckily for you, as a MIL, she is entirely your husband\u2019s responsibility to manage.

While it makes sense that she blames the hospital - being that there isn't really anyone else she can blame and needs to blame someone - it's unreasonable of her to expect you to not work there. Especially being that it sounds like this was an unfortunate but unavoidable situation. I hope your husband has your back on this one.", "NTA", "NTA. Tell her you will help make the hospital better.", "NTA. Tell MIL you have learned a lesson from what happened to your FIL. You being at that hospital is going to increase the quality of care. That should be the goal. Right?", "My uncle died in the hospital where he did his residency and had worked at for decades before starting his own practice to \u201cslow down\u201d. It was a procedure that they fully expected him to come out of with no problems, performed by a colleague he\u2019d known his whole professional career and would have sent his mother and children to. \n\nI share that to point out that a bad outcome is not necessarily indicative of the quality of care at a hospital. A pattern of bad outcomes would be more concerning. But I\u2019m guessing this is more of an emotional response than a rational one. Hell my aunt\u2019s in laws were flat out accusing her of conspiring to murder the uncle because she didn\u2019t want to investigate it as potential malpractice after the death (they no longer speak\u2026).  I\u2019d see what your husband thinks and maybe ask him to address it to her as the job being potentially beneficial to your family unit and financial future.", "That is really sensible advice. She is much too emotional right now to have a rational discussion about this.\n\nLater on, though, I wonder if it might help to present your work at that hospital to her as \"being part of the solution\" and \"making sure bad things don't happen to other patients'.", ">you reassure her that although you\u2019ll be working in that hospital, you\u2019ve no plans to work in the Cardiac Unit (assuming that isn\u2019t your plan).\n\n\n\nAnd if she is posted there to work, she will tell them no because her MIL doesn't want it?\n\nHow does one ever have a footing telling some other adult where to work and where not to and going about it like it's a concluded matter?", "NAH. My brother died as a result of medical malpractice at a hospital (we sued and won).  I never want to step foot in that hospital system again. But my nieces/nephews have needed to use it for various reasons. I can\u2019t deny them that. It\u2019s understandable that your MIL is upset and it\u2019s understandable why you want to work there.

The human body still has so many secrets and every individual is different. My Mum can tell you of many people who came in with a minor complaint and ended up disabled or dead.", "NTA.\n\nThe hospital didn't do anything that directly cause the incident it was a complication to a procedure that probably would have happened no matter where he had it done. Your MIL is angry and looking for someone to blame in time she will hopefully realize it was a complication and no one is to blame.", "NTA. If MIL thinks it\u2019s the hospitals fault, she can get a lawyer and sue.", "This isn't something you need to discuss with her while her husband is basically half dead. She feels that were neglectful and honestly, if he went without oxygen for 10 minutes IN a hospital recovery room, she may very well be right. \n\nBut none of this is something to decide on right now. Give her her space and when she says things like that, just don't respond. Make no promises and see how everything works out with your FIL. \n\nNAH.", "NTA... She is taking her anger out on the hospital instead of the unfortunate event. Undiagnosed sleep apnea can cause strokes and heart attacks and cause complications. Even if the hospital was at fault, it's not the entire building, it was missed by the staff in shift at that moment. Mistakes happen everywhere at even the best of hospitals.  All you can do is do your best.", "NTA Your MIL is being unrealistic, especially if the event was caused by an undiagnosed condition.\n\nYour best chance at having a decent nursing career will helped by working at a large urban hospital center for a few years, so do what is best for you and your needs.", "NTA. Your MIL obviously went through something traumatic, but she\u2019s being unreasonable. If her emotions are going to jeopardize your career, she needs to think about going to therapy to help work through what happened.", "No. \"I do not know that. If anything, it sounds like they could use more competence on staff, and we don't want other families going through what happened to FIL.\"", "NTA. Tell your MIL to buzz off", "NAH.  I understand her pain, but sometimes it's nobody's fault when things go badly, and I think an undiagnosed underlying condition just might be one of those times.  Unless she would have blamed herself if he'd had the heart attack napping in the recliner right beside her, it might not be fair to blame the hospital.  You don't have to sabotage your career plans because another person has some crazy ideas about your most promising employer.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust ignore MIL, and refuse to discuss it.", "NTA", "This is the way.", "NTA.\n\nYou can't really blame the entire hospital or hospital system for the outcome.  Elective surgery, like all surgery, carries risk.  Add an undiagnosed condition to it, and you're increasing your risk, albeit unknowingly, but a possibly huge factor.  Sounds to me like you find this as reasonable explanation for the outcome, and as someone being trained in medicine that adds weight to your thoughts on it.  If you think it's the fault of the hospital that would be a different story, and you could choose not to work there, or even file a lawsuit if there's grounds for one.\n\nThe fact is that you will need a job, and if this is where you get one that pays, its where you need to go.\n\nGood luck.", "i mean, this seems like a very obvious irrational grief response, to me. i say this not because doctors don\u2019t mess up, but because she\u2019s not blaming a doctor, or a nurse, or a testing machine, she\u2019s blaming \u201cthe hospital\u201d and telling you that you can\u2019t work for \u201cthem\u201d. \n\nyou can work for them. it might affect your relationship with your mil, but it doesn\u2019t follow that you should change your career trajectory because she is understandably upset about a very tragic event. the fact that she is going so hard on telling you what you can and can\u2019t do hopefully means this is her lashing out, and if you don\u2019t engage with her on this right now she\u2019ll be in a better state when it\u2019s actually happening, but i can\u2019t be sure. nta.", "She\u2019s reacting emotionally.

To quote the Lorax \u201c unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothings going to get better, it\u2019s just not\u201d.\n\nWhat better way to honor your dad than helping others receive great care?", "NTA\n\nBut what does your husband think?\n\nIf he's sharing your MIL's insane logic about his father, you're going to be really having problems with him rather than your MIL.\n\nI say this as a guy: do your thing, but make sure your husband has your back, because if he doesn't, there's no point to that marriage because you might as well be a person with no say in anything with your husband and MIL running your life.", "This this this!", "Honestly, its possible she might be blaming herself. Snoring is a common symptom of sleep apnea and if they shared the same bed....well, its easier and less painful to blame the hospital."]}
