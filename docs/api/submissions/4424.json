Not because you are not leaving your home to your children but because you want to destroy a home made of limited natural resources because the idea of someone else living in it after you both are DEAD is uncomfortable. It is ultimately your property and you have every right to do with it as you wish but you would still be an AH for destroying something perfectly usable because you don\u2019t want anyone else to use it. My husband and I are only the second people to have owned our home. It was the original couples dream home and when we moved in you could tell it had been well taken care of.

But I see very little about how the house holds every childhood memory your children have and how much it means to them.

No wonder your kids are upset. \n\nNo one else can live in this beautiful house?? I cannot believe this is real.  What an absolute waste. Donate it. Make it a vacation home for your whole family to use that is maintained through a set trust. Give it to a friend under the condition that the spirit of the property is maintained. Do anything other than tear it down.", "YTA. Demolishing a perfectly good house as some sort of territorial fuck you is ridiculous and exceedingly wasteful and being a terrible steward to the environment. \n\nThere's a simple solution to preventing the kids arguing over this and is not wasteful- stipulate in your will that the house and property be sold and the proceeds split evenly among your children, if they try to argue about it or fight it, they get removed as a beneficiary of the proceeds.

So NAH\n\nBut I do think you're doing a huge disservice to your children. When you die they're going to look for anything they have to keep the memories of you and your husband alive. And you destroying that house is basically destroying the part of not only their childhood but their attachment to you.\n\nPeople still visit their childhood homes even if it's not in their families. It's where they grew up and learned about the world. I get that it's your dream home but it's literally the home that they grew into the people they are today. It's where they learned what love is, what family is, what futures they had. \n\nYour attachment to your home over your sentimental bond to your children is a bit... Odd. \n\nYour kids don't want the home because they like the house, but because you'll be dead and they want a piece of their childhood and of their parents with them. But you're putting your obsession with your house over your family. \n\nFor some reason you got guys want this big poetic end where your shared life is torn to the ground and \"killed\" along with you. Can't you see how messed up it is to your kids? That you almost want to erase what's close to your heart? Without even considering that it's close to their heart too? \n\nI think this is kind of interesting because your kids went the house to stand because of how much they love their childhood and their parents.

Here\u2019s why. It\u2019s your property and you are entitled to do with it what you want, but you are talking about preferences from beyond the grave. You are choosing to sacrifice your living kids\u2019 happiness in order to maintain your peace of mind when dead? Doesn\u2019t make sense to me and seems unkind to your family who treasure this house. Can you figure out a way to keep it peacefully in the family when you\u2019re gone? It would honor the house much more than demolition and it would mean a lot to the living who have already lost you and probably want to hang onto whatever memories they have. You say you all are close- they\u2019re going to miss you TONS and time in the place you all shared together will mean a lot. Someone suggested making it a vaca home for everyone to share- that sounds like a great idea. Or maybe you find another way they can share it and just be sure to work it out before you\u2019re gone so you don\u2019t have to worry about them fighting. It would be a shame for you and your family to lose something that means so much to you all.", "YTA only from the angle that it sounds like soon after losing one or both of you, their childhood home will also be destroyed. That\u2019s a lot of loss to handle at once.", "Have you considered the absolute mind boggling amounts of waste this will create? You say that your kids don\u2019t need the money but you do understand that property without a home on it is worth significantly less money than with a home? If it\u2019s your kid\u2019s family home too, why are you opposed to keeping it in the family (you could create a trust so they couldn\u2019t sell it but it could be kept in your family for them to use)?\n\nOverall it\u2019s your house so you\u2019re NTA but this is just a really weird, selfish, and wasteful thing to do. You\u2019re going to be dead so why would it matter if someone else lives in it?", "It's strange to me that you'd want it demolished and I agree that it seems really wasteful, but ultimately, it's yours to do with as you see fit. You built it, you own it, you get to decide what happens to it. NTA.  \n\n\nCan I suggest, though, that you allow any pieces that can be reused to be donated to a charity that builds homes for those in need? Habitat for humanity, for an example. Things like cabinets and fixtures can be taken out re-used if they're in good condition. You could find a charity like that, and will that they be allowed to go into the home and take anything they could use before the building is demolished.
