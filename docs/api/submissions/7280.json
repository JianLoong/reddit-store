Anyway one of the rules is no music and earbuds, which I get. We're working in a warehouse after all and there are dangers. A lot of people don't follow the rules. Most don't care. When I first got hired I let them know about the hearing device situation so that they didn't mistake it for earbuds and write me up or call me out.\n\nIt was all fine, the managers are AWESOME people and very relaxed. People do wear earbuds and listen to music and most of the time they look the other way unless they have no choice but to say something. That was until a new manager comes in with the typical chip on her shoulder. She accused me of listening to music and wearing earbuds, and threatened to write me up. I had another manager come over and explain but she wouldn't believe it and she wrote me up. I keep my phone in my locker. I hate phones so I only use it in emergencies. I went to HR with it, and because they are so public they actually did something about it and really chewed her down about it. Forcing her to apologize to me in front of the other managers. Now, she complains that I could have just 'reasoned' with her and I didn't have to go so far with it. But I had tried and she wouldn't listen. Now the other managers are fine and said I did the right thing because she wouldn't listen to reason. She blames me for creating a bad work environment. She thinks I'm an AH or some variant for taking it so far. This is the first job I've had in 10 years, and I'm still getting my footing on protocols and what's right and wrong.

She's a walking bad work environment who has no clue of how to be a manager (and yes, I can say that just on what you posted without a qualm.)\n\nYou shouldn't be questioning your actions here at all.", "I would go back to HR for harassment", "Absolutely NTA\n\nShe could have been fired for interfering with your disability.\n\nYou were respectful and had the other manager involved to explain. The fact she retaliated and still wrote you up was HER fuckup.\n\nThe only person making a stupid stink about it is her.", "Not the asshole, but she certainly is. You tried to tell her. Other managers who had been there longer tried to tell her. She could have checked with HR, since it\u2019s probably documented in your file. She chose to go on a power trip and write you up. You did the only thing you could do. Once she escalated it by writing you up, you *had* to go to HR to make sure it didn\u2019t affect your employment. As a manager, she should have known better than to make an issue over a hearing aid. They hired you knowing you have a disability. They can\u2019t legally reprimand you for that same disability. And refusing to let you wear your hearing aid puts you in danger in a warehouse setting. They would have a massive lawsuit on their hands if you got injured because you couldn\u2019t hear a forklift coming up behind you or something.", "NTA \nSounds like you tried to do this the easy mutual way and she refused", "She's for sure gonna be on the lookout for something else to slam you for. Make sure you document every time she comes at you from now, write down; what and when it happened, and who were there (witnesses). Even very minor stuff. Then, when you feel like you have enough, go back to HR and complain about her retaliating at you for her previous having to apologize to you for having written you up for having a hearing device. I foresee that that documentation is gonna be real valuable in the future..", "No, you did exactly as you should have.  The new manager *didn\u2019t believe another manager when told the situation and she still wrote you up*. You can\u2019t let this go. WTF\n\nYou defended yourself. Good for you, and as redditors are  quick to say, (but it is appropriate here), she fucked around and found out. NTA", "NTA. She jumped to conclusions and you tried to correct her assumptions to no avail. You're not wrong in attempting to cover yourself when faced with ignorance fuelled by a superiority complex. She's just mad that the wind was taken out of her sails.", "NTA - The moment you were written up you needed to go to HR. The manager was not open to 'reason' even after her peer manager spoke up. She is trying to minimize her role in what occurred. Remain pleasant and free up your head space; you are/were not the ahole.", "NTA, she fucked around and found out, if she continues to give you a hard time, document it and go back to HR.", "NTA, sounds like you need to go back to HR if shes saying those things to you.", "NTA. The entire situation could have been avoided if she had just listened to the other managers when they told her it was a hearing aid. She brought it on herself. Don't feel bad.", "NTA, she did it to herself. As you said she wouldn't listen, don't be afraid to go over her head again if she's picking on you.", "NTA - You tried. She fucked around and found out.", "NTA.  She harassed you and you took it to HR, which is literally their job.", "NTA 1) You tried to reason with her as did another manager. She was being unreasonable. 2) She was being ableist and being a jerk about your accessibility device. That shit NEEDS to be called out. The more people call out this kind of behavior the better it is for all of us who need accessibility devices.   \n\n\nBTW, since you're new to this party, you should always have your friends also grab captioning devices in the theatre for two reasons. 1) It encourages theatres to carry and maintain the captioning devices and 2) That way when one device doesn't work, which is so common, you  can use the one your friend grabbed.", "NTA\n\nIf she mentions this again in any way, you have two choices. The first, and because I don\u2019t suffer fools, would be to go back to HR because what she\u2019s doing is straight up harassment. No wonder she came in with a chip on her shoulder; she probably has a string of prior violations tied to her record.\n\nThe second is slightly less volatile: When she remarks upon this again, respond along the lines of, \u201cIf you mention this to me again, I will be speaking with HR about harassment.\u201d Essentially, option two gives her a \u201clast chance.\u201d", "NTA, fuck that", "She embarrassed herself and is taking it out on you NTA", "NTA, and look out for retaliation from managers like that.  They pull anything and go back to HR.  Sometimes HR does what they're supposed to", "NTA. She sounds like a bully.", "NTA.  You followed protocol to the letter.  She's the one who created a bad working environment by not asking questions first, listening to facts when she was given them, and ultimately discriminating against you because of your disability.  Now she's trying to make her terrible behaviour your fault.", "NTA. You tried to explain and she didn't believe you. She made a major blunder on two grounds and management were right to chew her out. She was informed of a reasonable adjustment for a disability and still insisted you remove it though others supported you. She put the company at risk of a H&S breach because her actions put you at real risk of the danger the earbud rule was made to avoid - not hearing dangers.\n\nIf she keeps going after you, remind her that harassing someone for raising a reasonable grievance is also a HR matter, that she is creating a hostile environment and that her ignoring your need for a aid put you at real risk of an accident.", "NTA the other manager even vouched for you.  She needs to learn about how to manage people.", "NTA. You did try to reason with her. You're an adult working at a professional job, there would be absolutely no reason for you to lie about having a hearing aid. If the issue has been brought up with management, I'm assuming there is some kind of record that she could have consulted or she could have asked one of the other managers. Instead, she decided to ignore your explanation and the resources that she had at her disposal, and simply assert her \"authority.\" She's mad that she made the wrong call- you did not get her in trouble or embarrass her; she did that all by herself.", "NTA. Report her ass again for saying that you have created a bad work environment. This woman has no business in management and if she isn't stopped now you will be looking over your shoulder for her next stunt. She didn't listen to you or the other managers. That means she has no intentions of listening to anyone about anything. That is a disaster about to happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I strongly suggest you go tell that managers boss that this manager is saying to you after the hr confrontation. I've had some situations where managers were jackasses.

I want them to leave me alone.\"\n\nI've gotten moved managers maybe 4 times because I requested it (in several years). Once directly to the unwanted managers face (he made a bad first impression joking about safety issues on his first day, the second I got assigned to him I just told him I wanted the other manager). Twice I asked the manager I wanted to be assigned to. The other time, I told their boss that I wasn't comfortable answering to someone who was coming across as biased against me in their manner of jokes.\n\nThe comments after talking to her are in a gray area and maybe hr reportable.

What do I need to do to stop getting harassed about reporting an issue to hr?\"", "In addition to my other reply to you - if you aren't comfy with reporting the continued comments to hr, I'd go to the other managers that you're calling cool. \"Hey, Jane Doe is making me uncomfortable. Can you and I talk about this?\"\n\nFor one, they'll have a better idea than you about which member of hr is the correct rank to take this to.
