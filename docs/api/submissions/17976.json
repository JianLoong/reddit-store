He\u2019s the asshole just for waking up a sick person trying to sleep all on its own. The reasons for waking her up makes it worse. I feel like no one is focusing enough on that.

She should've reminded him, instead of he should've remebered. Isn't he physically capable of ordering himself food? Lol she should pay for his food but he can't cook her a meal? How can you expect that from her considering we can't expect anything from him?\n\n\nAnd yes, the convo is at its end because it is entirely ridicoulus to expect a sick person to take care of a healthy person jusz because they work a totally normal shift.", "He\u2019s also a grown adult who could have opted to order food when he got home instead of cooking. He opted to cook, but decided the extremely sick one who had already stated a need for food would have to wait until he felt like it.

I don\u2019t have to have multiple reasons for every opinion I have lol.\n\nIt\u2019s reasonable that he wanted to relax a bit before cooking dinner after working nine hours and commuting home. And she obviously did not wait two hours. Either way, ordering some takeout is a lot easier than cooking dinner, which is why the take out of business is so popular around the world.\n\nWe have no idea what their financial situation is, who pays for the food and all of that. But feel free to walk out on the conversation without having made a single valid point\ud83d\udc4d", "Yeah, sure, expevting the sick person to take care of a healthy person is always totally valid and pointing out that the bf is just as capable is not.
