What your mother said about having sex with your boyfriend is absolutely horrendous, but the fact that she won't take accountability for it or apologize is just unforgivable. She obviously feels no remorse.  I wouldn't be surprised if she actually ends up fucking him in the near future. That woman is no maternal figure. Maintain a good distance from her and keep an eye on your boyfriend.", "Wow, oh wow. I can't blame you. So out of line on mom's part and she can't even admit it. She should have been embarrassed and said, \"OMG, I can't believe I said that\" and then apologized to the both of you.

I can only imagine what else she\u2019s done.", "Obviously there's some history with your mother that we are not privy to which is fine, we can't know everything that's happened over the last 19 years but a statement like that doesn't come from a one-off incident. I don't think you were wrong for having a reaction to her blase response to her own terrible actions. I think you were in an emotional state and you had an emotional outburst. The real question is did you mean it? If you did then I think it takes some examination as to why and probably a conversation with your mom needs to happen regarding your feelings. If you didn't mean it then I do think an apology is necessary but make it clear that just because you're apologizing for what you said, it doesn't make what she did okay and if you're adult enough to apologize for that then she should be adult enough to apologize for her actions. Your response to her does not let her off the hook.", "Unacceptable by your mother. Also can I get an invite next year?", "NAH\n\nShe generally avoids drinking because of how wild she gets when she is drunk. The fact that she got flirty with your boyfriend likely doesn't actually mean anything.\n\nShe's a person who doesn't drink often who apparently got hammered, and it was a Halloween party besides.\n\nYour boyfriend probably *is* handsome. So that's a plus.", "Mom blows best?\u2026", "At least you know your mom likes your taste in men?", "While you may have crossed the line by saying you hated her... you weren't entirely off base.  You did hate *what she said*, and *what she did* when she was drunk.   So don't feel too bad about what you said in the heat of the moment.  When cooler heads prevail, you can walk that back.\n\nIt's very, very weird for your Mom to say that kind of stuff about you and your boyfriend.  That's not, in any way, appropriate.  It's downright squicky, nobody's gonna fault you on that part.  My Mom and I never, ever, EVER talked about things she could or would do to my Dad in the bedroom, even when she was three sheets to the wind.  Your Mom can dismiss what she said and play it off as a joke, but if she wants a relationship with you and possibly him in the future, she needs to own up to her mistakes and stop pretending.  She needs to apologize. It's up to you if and when you're ready to accept that apology.  \n\nI personally would accept it, but I would also tell Mom that if she wants to be around me or my boyfriend ever again, she cannot drink in our presence.  And, she needs to apologize to the boyfriend, and promise to never talk about him like that again.  \n\nI vote NTA.", "NTA\n\nThat being said there are a couple of things you might consider. Obviously your mom had you at 16, that's really young, she likely has some issues from losing her childhood. That doesn't excuse her behaviour but it does provide some context. And you should consider whether you're willing to lose your relationship with your mother over this. Maybe she's been a terrible mother and this was just the last straw but if not I don't know that a statement made in a drunken stupor justifies this response. Demanding an apology? Absolutely. Ghosting her? Maybe too far.", "Alcohol is the worst drug any person can consume!. Doesn\u2019t drink often because she \u201cknows\u201d how she gets!
