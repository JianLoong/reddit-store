On top of that she had a rare disorder and was blind because no one in her state wanted to do the surgery bc it was so complicated. \n\nI told her she could come here, blocked all the previous trauma and was in denial. She got here and she was awful. Calling me terrible names, demanding and scaring my children. I told her she must go into a nursing home bc my aunt wouldn\u2019t take her and my sister didn\u2019t want her back. \n\nThis caused a lot of drama in my family, due to the pension she had from my step father.  My aunt and uncle felt like she should stay with me bc she would lose her money to the nursing home.

They want me to accept the money and pay for her cremation. I looked into the policies today, they amount is a total of just over 8.4k. I declined to claim the policies today bc that is not enough to cremate anyone in my state plus with taxes taken out. \n\nTo me if I claim that money then I become responsible and I want nothing to do with it and barely make ends meet so when the 10k bill for the cremation comes in I\u2019m not covering the balance. \n\nMoreover I said no over two years ago and again when my sister asked me this summer.

Even when funeral homes are pricier there are places that do direct cremation for way way less, like 2k-ish. I'm a funeral director and have suggested before that people call a direct cremation place.\n\nBut that aside, the beneficiary of an insurance policy can usually sign over the proceeds directly to the funeral home. We do that a lot when the family doesn't have the liquid assets to pay. I do all the paperwork, they sign, and have notarized, an \"assignment of proceeds\" document.

Usually it tells you what she wants done with her body and how it's paid for.

When my mother passed away, we simply signed the life insurance over to the funeral home. It was my mother's estate that paid for her funeral. None of us was liable.

I know 20 years ago in ME, when my father died, it was $9500 but that was for a service too. I didn\u2019t realize it was so cheap which makes it so much more offensive to me. \nIF they had cremated her while I was away, and asked if I could contribute, I might of.
