After that was foster care. \n\nWe were always hungry and even at those young ages she would constantly ask me to be her boyfriend\u2019s child bride. \nShe did go to my wedding 25 years ago, and I would try and visit her once a year in her state about 12 hours away. \n\nAbout 3 years ago she said that she was being abused by my sister whom she had been living with for several years, maybe 5, in an in-law apartment that was built using my step father\u2019s insurance money when he passed about 12 years ago. On top of that she had a rare disorder and was blind because no one in her state wanted to do the surgery bc it was so complicated. \n\nI told her she could come here, blocked all the previous trauma and was in denial. She got here and she was awful. Calling me terrible names, demanding and scaring my children. I told her she must go into a nursing home bc my aunt wouldn\u2019t take her and my sister didn\u2019t want her back. \n\nThis caused a lot of drama in my family, due to the pension she had from my step father.  My aunt and uncle felt like she should stay with me bc she would lose her money to the nursing home.  I lived like that as a child and I was not exposing my kids to it. \n\nMy aunt becomes her proxy and next of kin and my uncle was always her financial advisor. I am taken off all of her paperwork at the nursing home Out of kindness I did find her specialist in Boston and took her to surgery bc the nursing home couldn\u2019t do that, it was 2.5 hours from my house. By the time she died she could see but still no one wanted her to live with them and I was not having her back. My aunt and uncle stopped talking to me, saying I stole her from her home.  I visited her sporadically but most of the time she was mean so it was hard to visit her. \n\nThis summer my sister asked if I wanted to pay for an insurance policy and I said absolutely no. I want nothing to do with that, I removed my name from everything and was by no means having anything to do with her death money.  \n\nShe died 2 weeks ago, and unbeknownst to me I am still the one named as her beneficiary. They want me to accept the money and pay for her cremation. I looked into the policies today, they amount is a total of just over 8.4k. I declined to claim the policies today bc that is not enough to cremate anyone in my state plus with taxes taken out. \n\nTo me if I claim that money then I become responsible and I want nothing to do with it and barely make ends meet so when the 10k bill for the cremation comes in I\u2019m not covering the balance. \n\nMoreover I said no over two years ago and again when my sister asked me this summer. They were all talking and they should have figured that out.", "created_utc": 1698685583, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17jy8ft/aitah_for_refusing_to_accept_insurance_money/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This doesn\u2019t sound like your problem.", "NTA. You didn't want anything and she did this on her own. Just because she named you doesn't mean you have to take it, especially if it means you might be taxed at a higher tax bracket and also because you'll be out of pocket for the cremation. \n\nMy question is why are you responsible for the cremation if you have nothing to do with her? The insurance money is to you and doesn't include requirements like paying for the cremation etc.", "Google \"low cost cremation\" \u2014 I'm seeing it as low as $1k, no memorials attached. \n\nHopefully the estate will handle that before issuing you anything .", "In my state, insurance is considered income and you *could* be taxed on it also.", "NTA. But just so you know, if you live in the US, there are no taxes due on life insurance; therefore, no taxes will be deducted.", "NTA\n\nYou are allowed to remove yourself from toxic people. That includes family who SIDE with toxic people. You are not wrong, nor to blame. When you stand up to a bully, the consequences are usually pain, emotional or physical. People who watch that pain, and do nothing, are not your friends. These remaining family should either apologize or learn to live with the NO CONTACT.", "NTA\n\nIt's your business and if you don't want anything to do with any of them, that's your choice to make.\n\nThat said, I don't think you usually have to pay taxes on insurance money.  And even if you accept the insurance, your family can't force you to pay for any funeral arrangements.  Lastly, iny high cost of living state, a cremation only with no service costs about $2k or less.\n\nBut as I said, you're well within your rights to wipe your hands of all of them.", "NAH, just people dealing with grief.\n\n>To me if I claim that money then I become responsible \n\nYou do not.  Life Insurance payouts are not part of the estate, they go directly to you and are not taxable (federal).\n\nIf you're struggling to make ends meet, take the money and use it for yourself.", "NTA, you mention \"estrange\" and that should be enough there and the only maximum thing you should have done was just \"prayers and thoughts\" to her. Other then that, I think that ship sailed in the end.", "NTA you don't have to accept the insurance money. But there is no state in New England where cremation costs $10,000. I can get one done in my New England state for \\~$1,000, and that's what my wife and I intend to do.\n\nPlus if you do accept the money, how can you legally be liable for the funeral costs if you didn't sign any of the funeral home paperwork? Your aunt and uncle should be the ones to sign that paperwork. What kind of life insurance policy is it that forces you to pay for the funeral that someone else signs all the paperwork for?", "Easy one, take the money which is yours under the insurance policy, but refuse to pay for cremation or anything else.  Why are you obligated to cover the cremation?", "NAH\n\nIf you don't accept the money, what happens to it? If it becomes \"lost funds,\" that will also kind of follow you around for the rest of your life.\n\nI don't see why you can't just accept the money then sign the check over to your sister and tell them all you wipe your hands of the funeral arrangements.

Do whatever is best for you.\n\nThat being said... is there really no way you could accept the money but refuse to take then responsibility for cremation?", "NTA \n\nHowever. If the money can ONLY be paid out to you, then you should accept it and do whatever you want. Give it to your siblings to deal with the cremation if you want no part. Donate it if you want.", "NTA but how expensive is cremation there? It's around $1500 here so it seems nuts that $8000 isn't enough. Nevertheless, you are absolutely not the AH for washing your hands of a horrible parent.", "NTA. In my US state, beneficiaries can take the money & do with it what they want. A funeral director told this to my Mother, as she was my Grandmother's beneficiary. Not sure if that is the case. This is NOT advice. I don't blame you for wanting nothing to do with it. Good luck OP", "NTA but I don't see why you can't accept the money and not still pay for the cremation.", "Nta\n\nWhere do y'all live that cremation is 10k??? Even when funeral homes are pricier there are places that do direct cremation for way way less, like 2k-ish. I'm a funeral director and have suggested before that people call a direct cremation place.\n\nBut that aside, the beneficiary of an insurance policy can usually sign over the proceeds directly to the funeral home. We do that a lot when the family doesn't have the liquid assets to pay. I do all the paperwork, they sign, and have notarized, an \"assignment of proceeds\" document. The amount I specify that the funeral/cremation cost is paid directly to us, and the rest is paid to the beneficiary. (I guess you could sign that over to whoever you want.)\n\nYou shouldn't be in the hock for any arrangements you didn't make with a funeral home and sign the contract on.", "We did a cremation for less than $1,000 about 18 months ago.", "Are you legally required to pay for the cremation if you take the insurance money?  Where I live, no. \n\nIf not, take the money.  Block your relatives.  Enjoy your new emergency fund or donate it to your favorite charity.  Let the relatives pay for the cremation or the state can put her in a pauper grave.", "Exactly! I do not know why they ever considered me to be the one who pays, bc they knew all along that there was insurance to me, I did not. They made up with me on her death bed and then starting calling me before her body was cold about what I was going to do with the body. Who even does that? Edit for typo.", "There is no estate per se I think she just had some random insurance policies.", "Yeah, really. A prepaid cremation runs about $1,500 in my state, and that includes a simple memorial.", "Thank you for that information.  I need more time honestly. It\u2019s all bringing up past trauma and I specifically did not partake in any insurance money with my step father bc it\u2019s all so uncomfortable to me.  That time it was like 80k and my sister bought property with it then added the in-law suite. I wanted nothing to do with it back then and was completely caught off guard.", "I did not know this. Thank you.", "The only problem with this is they sent the body to a funeral home and I\u2019m sure there are storage fees? I had a planned trip out of the country and was not going to miss it over the death of a woman who was not kind to me. \nI did not know it was so cheap to cremate her, then that\u2019s 2k a family and they have enough funds for that.", "I guess it\u2019s really their insistence for me to cash out the policy and give it to them. I have never been contacted by the funeral home, nor was I contacted by the nursing home until after my aunt told them to call me.", "I have no idea why they thought I should do it. Just because they knew there was money? Because I offered the olive branch on her death bed and they think I\u2019m a pushover and my no all these years really meant yes?", "I'm not sure if it's the same where OP lives, but I am pretty sure if the beneficiary doesn't accept it, it gets paid out to the estate and the executor handles the bills with it.", "I feel like it\u2019s all bad luck to take money on behalf of someone I didn\u2019t really like and not pay for her cremation.", "I might consider donating thank you for that suggestion.", "Sounds like they knew you were the beneficiary and made up hoping you'd give them some of the money, not thinking how much a cremation costs. \n\nThe fact they already stated that they didn't want her in the nursing home because it was wasting money suggests that they viewed that money as hers and wanted her to have you or the sister take care of her so there's more money in her estate. \n\nAlso, is there a will? Usually it tells you what she wants done with her body and how it's paid for. Some/many people have money set aside for their burial/cremation.", "Unless yiu signed something making you personally responsible, you're not responsible for these storage fees.  At least where I am.", "This is the problem of the family members who chose to call that funeral home. No one else is responsible. Most funeral homes require some payment up-front now. Trust me, there are ample red flags waving when you're talking to next-of-kin who won't be paying if you don't collect before services are rendered. \n\nEither way, that's not a you problem.", "If it's a standard life insurance policy, you can cash it out and keep the money and your aunt and uncle can go pound sand. And if they cut you off, that sounds like a bonus to me.\n\nIf you feel the need, you can research how much a plain creamation costs in your aunt's town and give that amount to your aunt and uncle. But you've no obligation to even do that.", "I think the OP needs to talk to a lawyer, because if the money just goes back into the estate if she refuses it, she likely should just walk away from it and walk away from those who are demanding she participate in the funeral/cremation arrangements altogether.", "Let's face it : you had an unlucky childhood and your mom was horrible. \n\nAnd now you have a little luck to have the opportunity to have some money you could put to good use. \n\nWhy not take the money and use it to spoil you sibling(s) and your own family ? Seems like a fair return after what you have endured.", "On point.  I now think the make up was staged. My aunt and uncle have money and properties. My sister does too. I have a 2k a month mortgage and a job that pays for it but not much more than that."]}
