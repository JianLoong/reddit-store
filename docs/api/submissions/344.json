Accept and move on.", "NAH - I wouldn't want other peoples car in my driveway on a holiday like Halloween. Between dumb ass teens and kids running around, it could be a recipe for disaster. If anything happens to your vehicle, your insurance would go after the home owner.  If kids runs into your side mirror and gets hurt, its on the property owner not you. Sure you get a sweet parking spot but they have all the liability if anything happens. And before you say you would never do that, its not up to you.

Also your child not getting to go to any Halloween parties is not her fault and has nothing to do with her.\n\nYou asked, she answered, time to let it go. Maybe she was a bit peeved you were going out while you were sick and she didn't want to condone that, or maybe she just didn't want you blocking her driveway for whatever reason.

Not so that you can challenge her. Now that time has passed, I'd wait a bit and then maybe broach the subject. But otherwise, her driveway, her rules.", "NAH but if you are friends I would ask her at some point in a very non-confrontational manner.\n\nI would do this because I find with friends it is better for the long term relationship to try to keep good communication going and not to let things potentially fester.\n\nFor example at some point if you are together, you could casually ask why she hadn't felt comfortable - was it because of your potential for germs or was it something else? Again not confrontational at all but coming from a place of genuine curiosity because frankly it is odd. I have used my friend's driveway occasionally to park - once actually for Halloween because she lives near a large parade where street parking is non-existent and once at another friend because I was going to the airport and I wanted to UBER from a closer place so that the fare wasn't as expensive.", "YTA. If she doesn't want you there, too bad. Her driveway, her rules. Park on a side street.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu were fine to ask, she was fine to decline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe she needs the parking space there herself, for grandpasrents coming over?", "Could be that she doesn't want to open that can if worms by letting you park there.  Then Larry can demand he gets to as well.  Then Tom, then Mary, then Felicia .... see where this is going?\n\nIf it's a popular spot for trick or treaters, she may not want to allow anyone to park there for fear if starting a precedent.\n\nShe said no.  Live with it.", "I just want say I havent done anything yet.

She is fully within her rights to say no for any or no reason.", "How old is your car? It could be a simple oil stain issue. \n\nOr what are her plans? She might be expecting company or she might have decorations in her drive way. YTA for calling her petty for saying no. She is allowed to say no.", "I get it OP. Honestly, I'd be curious as well. It might be worth asking after Halloween just so you can know if it would be appropriate to ask again in the future. \n\nMaybe she didn't want you there because you were sick, maybe she just doesn't like people in her driveway.

Yes driveway is big and yes she has every right to deny me. I just bend over backwards sometimes for my friend and then I get a cold response in return for a simple request.

Just be like \"hey, I'm worried that I might have made you uncomfortable the other day. Can I just ask what it was that made you uncomfortable?\"", "I get that which is why I suggest asking her in a very non-confrontational manner. If you have to rehearse it so that it comes out well.\n\nIn my experience, with good friends it is better to try to make the effort to communicate well just like spouses.\n\nWith casual friends, it really isn't as important because they drift in and out of your life.", "No I just meant it was a simple request sorry wrong choice of words.", "You're right but im definitely not asking this friend for ride to the hospital if I ever need one", "Whoa okay i did say I used wrong choice of word- petty...so let's move past that. My car is new, im guessing no party bc kid is sick and yes its her property...trying to gain a better understanding before I say anything if I do. Thank you", "Aaand I managed to delete my entire post when doing the edit... Great! \n\nYes, I completely get it as I said before the mishap with my comment. You're friends, you're asking to use part of her drive for a little while and she doesn't seem to have an actual good reason for it. Again, as I said in my comment, friends usually help each other. You're not asking for something unreasonable. You aren't asking to come in and use her hot tub and drink her wine for goodness sake. \n\nDon't bend over backwards for her when she can't do the same for you. As I said, if she has a real reason, such as guests coming over, she would say that. This sounds more like she's either upset with you or just being awkward for the sake of it. \nI disagree with anyone saying you should drop it. You should be able to carefully ask your friend if you've done something to upset her, as her response is strange between friends.", "Oh im sorry just the way it was worded I got confused. I definitely understand not to be non confrontational I thought you were say I wasn't being that...im thinking I didnt say or do anything lol\n\nI agree thank you", "Ok. BTW, YTA for asking for a reason. You asked, and she said no, it should be enough.", "Im mean you're right as in its her property\n..I might still ask ..."]}
