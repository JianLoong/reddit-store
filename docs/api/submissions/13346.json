Unfortunately, our mom passed away when we were really young, so I don't have any memories of her. Two years ago, we found out that our dad had a kid(15f) from an affair. Her mom went to jail, and since no one else wanted to take care of her, our dad took her in. And let me tell you, I can't stand her. She's nice to us when our dad is around, but when he's not, she's a total bitch. She acts like she owns the place and is always in our rooms, wearing my clothes without asking and touching my mom's stuff.\nAt first, I didn't say anything because my dad was treating her so special, but now she's just being so disrespectful and getting into our business. She's always following us around, being mean for no reason, and it's really frustrating. And when we tried to talk to our dad about it, he just got mad and said we were being unfair. Like, what?! She's the one being disrespectful and making us uncomfortable in our own home.\nSo, we had a family meeting to talk about it, and I told my dad that she's going into our rooms without permission and disrespecting our boundaries. But she argued that we go into each other's rooms all the time without asking, which is totally not the same thing. My brother even tried to explain that we're siblings and it's different, but my dad just got mad and said she's our sister too. But like, I don't see her as my sister. She's a stranger living in our house, and she needs to leave.\nBut now, my dad is mad at us and not listening to what we're saying. She's even playing the victim and getting sympathy from him. It's so frustrating because her behavior has been going on for so long and this has really been the straw for us.

If a blanket invitation is offered, then it will be allowed. If one is NOT offered, and someone is caught in someone else's room without permission, there need to be consequences.

No one asked for the situation and think about what she\u2019s experiencing. It doesn\u2019t necessarily excuse her part of stuff. \n\nI\u2019d suggest try a little empathy and a few really good locks from new sisterly access", "NAH. If anyone\u2019s TA it\u2019s your cheating dad, I\u2019d move that hostility to him instead of your affair sibling. Heck I\u2019d only refer to him as cheater for the rest of his life \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Get a lock on your door and find places to hide the stuff you want to keep safe from her. In two years you can leave and never have to see her again.", "Do you have any contact with your mom\u2019s family? Is it possible to go for an extended visit?", "ESH.  She should not be in you things/ room without permission.  However, she cannot move out.  She has no other family willing to take her other than your dad.   I'm sure she doesn't want to be there anymore than you want her there,  but life stinks and sometimes you have to make the best of a crappy situation.  Your father should be listening to your complaints and makings sure she knows to not touch your things or enter your room without permission from YOU.  Unfortunately, he's not listening. He's probably thinking it's just a bit of sibling rivalry and he's not entirely wrong. He is handling it poorly though. \n\n\nMaybe try using your cell phone to record audio or video of her bad behavior to prove your point to your dad.   If she's wearing your clothes without permission call her out in front of your dad,  demand that she returns them IMMEDIATELY  as you find this unacceptable and you will call the police to report a theft if they do not comply. No excuses, no BS from her or father.  If he won't parent her then you will have to use resources at disposal to correct the issue.", "ESH As a kid who had a similar situation with my step sister growing up, I get it. She\u2019s touching your stuff without permission, going into your room without asking when you don\u2019t have the same relationship with her as you do with your brothers, disrespecting your mothers things, and wearing your belongings. I can understand that from your perspective she sucks and she\u2019s acting like she owns the place.\n\nI would ask you to think about it from her perspective though: Her mom is in jail, she just barely met her biological dad, she\u2019s in a new place, and most of the people she lives with don\u2019t like her. She\u2019s probably just trying to fit in by copying how she sees your and your brothers interact. \n\nBoth of you are being wronged in this situation with how you treat each other. It wasn\u2019t cool for you to tell her no one wants her there, she probably already feels that way. You\u2019re also being wronged bf your dad since he\u2019s not disciplining any of you or setting boundaries. \n\nIf you want try talking to her one on one or at a family meeting and explaining how it makes you feel when she uses your stuff without asking. Explain to her that it\u2019s gonna take time to get a relationship with her that\u2019s similar to the one you have with your brothers, if you even want that. You could also ask your dad for a lock for your room so you can keep your things more private. For now though, stick to talking it out and setting up some boundaries and mutual respect.", "YTA. Clearly this is a very hard time for you, but please look at it from her point of view. She did not ask to be born into those circumstances. The thing she needs absolutely more than anything else is love and security. I do think that family therapy would be wise here because she clearly needs to understand boundaries. But she needs a home, she needs security.", "ESH. Dad mishandled this, but you and sibs do not own the house.  Dad dose. It's not up to you who lives there, it's his choice. You have no right to tell her to leave....put a lock on your door and move on.", "YTA - who is the \u201cwe\u201d that you speak of? Does it include the person responsible for paying the bills? You have zero say in the matter. You are a child and not the parent.", "YTA\n\nHe wants her around, so what you said was a flat out lie. Grow up. \n\nYou're mad your dad had an affair and your mom is dead so you're stuck with him and taking it out on her.\n\nShe didn't have the affair, your father did.", "ESH. But I do think you're father is the biggest AH in here. It understandable on both side (this is a big change for ALL of the kids) but that doesn't make it right. She might be acting out because of all this change but that doesn't excuse her for coming into your rooms and taking things without permissions. That should be a common respect thing.  It's fine that you feel that way but I don't think you should say things to spite others.  I don't know what you're dad is doing but that y'all have a sit down and set boundaries so everyone knows how to respect each others lines.", "YTA. What you're doing is bullying. You're both technically kids and he's her father as much as yours. She has as much right to be there as you. You don't need to be friends, and your dad needs to make sure everyone behaves respectfully, but you're old enough to be able to support him in that rather than fighting him.", "NTA but get a lock for your stuff. Lock your things up so they\u2019re not accessible to her. If she is being disrespectful then ignore her and move on. If she\u2019s like a stranger to you then treat her like so. You don\u2019t have to be friends with everyone, but keep in mind asking your dad to kick her out is not a reasonable or attainable expectation.", "YTA. Whether you see her as your sister or not, she is your Father's daughter too and has every right to be there. It is not different than your other siblings.  \n\n\nDid it once cross your mind that her behavior is no worse than yours and could even be the result of you and your brothers treating her so poorly.", "YTA. You are mad that your dad couldn't keep it in his pants. That is his fault, not hers. She is a child. She is acting out because she is going through a lot of turmoil. **You are doing the exact same thing.** Like it or not, she is your sibling. Your dad is her sole available parent, just like he is for you. She isn't going anywhere. You need to come to an understanding with her, or you will have a long two years.", ">So, like, am I wrong for telling my dad's kid that we don't want her around? Lemme give you some background. I'm a 16-year-old girl\n\nwhat did you think was going to happen here?\n\nShe's a minor. She can't just leave and move out on her own \ud83e\udd74 You sound a bit emotionally inept, but I doubt you're too immature to realize at least that. \n\nwich leads me to believe that you KNOW there wasn't going to be any action to come from you saying that anyway. you did it just to hurt her. \n\nAlso, you are literally a child. you get no say in that house and who lives in it.\n\nYes, it sounds like she's doing things she shouldn't as well, but holy shit you just sound so awful and full of yourself that it doesn't matter, in my opinion.\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nThe three of you stick together. Keep asking her and your dad, \"ah, how long is your mom in jail?\"", "YTA. Whether you like it or not, this person is as much your father's daughter as you are. Her mom is in prison and she has come to live with her father. Why are you punishing her for something that isn't in her control? \n\nSetting a boundary that you don't want her to come in and out of your room without permission didn't seem like an unreasonable request, but then you turn around and insist she just needs to leave. You don't really care about the boundary, you just want a reason to hate this person.", "YTA. She\u2019s in a home that should  be considered hers as well. Like it or not she IS your sister. You need to realize her mother is not in the picture. I understand yours passed away and I am sorry for that as I know exactly how that feels. She should not be going into your mom\u2019s things. I don\u2019t think she should go into your rooms, but as she said, your other siblings do it, so she probably thought it was okay. I think most of the resentment you have towards her is because your father had the affair, that is no way on her. She didn\u2019t ask to be born, and not under those circumstances. You need to see the situation from and outside perspective. She\u2019s not trying to get your father\u2019s sympathy. She is trying to fit into her new family.", "Your dad is treating her so special, as you put it, because her mom is in jail & all of you are treating her like dirt. It\u2019s a difficult situation. You\u2019ve all had a lot to deal with, but at least you & your brothers have had each other. She has no one. It isn\u2019t your house. It isn\u2019t your decision who lives in your dad\u2019s house. You should be supportive of your dad & your sister. Your dad cheated years ago. Everyone makes mistakes. You & your brothers are making a huge mistake right now by being cruel.   \nTry looking at his differently. If you were this daughter would you want your father to take you in & show you love? Of course you would. You should admire & respect your dad for the actions he is taking right now. Leave the past in the past.\n\nBe kind. It\u2019s really that simple.", "ESH, especially you.", "NTA. Shes only going to get worse. Shes turning into an entitled bi tch.", "Your Dad is a massive AH. That\u2019s where this ends.\n\nYou are a teenager projecting your upset at your Dad for cheating on your mother. You are picking on his \u201cnew\u201d daughter because it is easier that telling your Dad he is a massive asshat for creating this situation and managing it so badly.\n\nYour half sister is a teenager thrust into an unfamiliar house full of people who resent her with an absent mother and a father she barely knows. She probably lost a load of friends, maybe changed school - we don\u2019t know. But she isn\u2019t to blame for your Dad cheating on your Mum.\n\nGive her a break and if you need to blame someone your Dad is the one. Your sister is acting up because she is lost, resentful and her life is upside down.\n\nDid I mention that your Dad is an AH?", "ESH I think. \nWhen my siblings (half step or otherwise) barged into my room I was NEVER ok with it. \nShe's going through some shit. It's hard when your mom is gone but different when they're actually alive but kinda gone. She's 15. You all need to give her some slack. \nShe sounds like she's lashing out and given the situation I can't blame her. \n\nI'm sorry for your personal loss with your mom. It sucks and never really gets better. While you've had time to adjust, I know it doesn't make it easier. \nHer mom is in prison. In an entirely different capacity her life has also been turned upside down. \n\nYou all need to take a look at how you're treating each other. You know how cruel teenagers can be, especially when an invader is present. She can't possibly feel welcome and that's not likely to proc her to be the world's best sister around you guys.", "YTA I'm sorry, but nothing you've described is particularly bitchy or mean. I *know* this is hard on you, and you're going through a lot of turmoil right now. But put yourself in her shoes for five minutes. I don't know how much she knew your dad before now, but I'm guessing he was a minor presence in her life, if anything, due to the affair. She grew up not really getting to have him around due to circumstances out of her control and now is having to live with him even though she may not really even know him. And now her mom is in jail, which would be destabilizing enough, but she got thrown in a home where it's *four* against one. You all know and love each other and grew up with each other and due to, again, circumstances out of her control, y'all are set against her. She's just trying to find her place. She's probably acting really confident because she's actually terrified and insecure and not sure where she belongs. I know you're a kid, too, and that this situation is terribly unfair on you, but it'd be really amazing if you could try extending an olive branch and help her realize this is her home now, too. Not just a place she's being shuffled around to because nobody wants her.", "YTA.  What a horribly unkind person you are.", "I don't see why she feels entitled to steal your clothes and other things. From now on keep all those things locked away.", "OP is 16 and her mom is dead and now she\u2019s having to deal with some girl messing with her stuff and her father playing favorites. OP\u2019s life *sucks* just as much as the life of the girl who can at least still communicate with her mom.", "So OP deserves to have her stuff messed with and to have someone in her household be mean to her because she, a teenager, is reacting to that person in the expected manner for a teenager? Yikes. Have you considered not victim blaming? It\u2019s really gross.", "Maybe they wouldn\u2019t be treating her like dirt if she wasn\u2019t treating them the same way.", "That is a fair point.\n\nThe worst thing she has done, IMO, she mess with OP\u2019s Mom\u2019s stuff. It is possible she didn\u2019t know that is who they had belonged to. At any rate, that should absolutley be off limits.   \nAs far as clothing goes, she also should never try on or borrow OP\u2019 s clothes. We only have OP\u2019s perspective here though. Does this girl have nice clothes? Has she ever had nice clothes? Has she lived in poverty all her life? Been abused?   \nThe dad should get the clothing/room/personal space settled. Maybe some new clothing for all the kids would be helpful not as a bribe, but to make sure the new resident has nice clothing & the others don\u2019t feel slighted.\n\nIt isn\u2019t an easy situation for anyone. It is 3 against 1 though. I can understand  feeling resentful. They don\u2019t have to be best buds or lovely dovey. They all just need to be as mature about this as they can as a bunch of teenagers who are hurting."]}
