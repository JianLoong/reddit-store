She should not be in you things/ room without permission.  However, she cannot move out.  She has no other family willing to take her other than your dad.   I'm sure she doesn't want to be there anymore than you want her there,  but life stinks and sometimes you have to make the best of a crappy situation.  Your father should be listening to your complaints and makings sure she knows to not touch your things or enter your room without permission from YOU.  Unfortunately, he's not listening. He's probably thinking it's just a bit of sibling rivalry and he's not entirely wrong. He is handling it poorly though. \n\n\nMaybe try using your cell phone to record audio or video of her bad behavior to prove your point to your dad.   If she's wearing your clothes without permission call her out in front of your dad,  demand that she returns them IMMEDIATELY  as you find this unacceptable and you will call the police to report a theft if they do not comply. No excuses, no BS from her or father.  If he won't parent her then you will have to use resources at disposal to correct the issue.", "ESH As a kid who had a similar situation with my step sister growing up, I get it. She\u2019s touching your stuff without permission, going into your room without asking when you don\u2019t have the same relationship with her as you do with your brothers, disrespecting your mothers things, and wearing your belongings. I can understand that from your perspective she sucks and she\u2019s acting like she owns the place.\n\nI would ask you to think about it from her perspective though: Her mom is in jail, she just barely met her biological dad, she\u2019s in a new place, and most of the people she lives with don\u2019t like her. She\u2019s probably just trying to fit in by copying how she sees your and your brothers interact. \n\nBoth of you are being wronged in this situation with how you treat each other. It wasn\u2019t cool for you to tell her no one wants her there, she probably already feels that way. You\u2019re also being wronged bf your dad since he\u2019s not disciplining any of you or setting boundaries. \n\nIf you want try talking to her one on one or at a family meeting and explaining how it makes you feel when she uses your stuff without asking. Explain to her that it\u2019s gonna take time to get a relationship with her that\u2019s similar to the one you have with your brothers, if you even want that. You could also ask your dad for a lock for your room so you can keep your things more private. For now though, stick to talking it out and setting up some boundaries and mutual respect.", "YTA. Clearly this is a very hard time for you, but please look at it from her point of view. She did not ask to be born into those circumstances. The thing she needs absolutely more than anything else is love and security. I do think that family therapy would be wise here because she clearly needs to understand boundaries. But she needs a home, she needs security.", "ESH. Dad mishandled this, but you and sibs do not own the house.  Dad dose. It's not up to you who lives there, it's his choice. You have no right to tell her to leave....put a lock on your door and move on.", "YTA - who is the \u201cwe\u201d that you speak of? Does it include the person responsible for paying the bills?

But I do think you're father is the biggest AH in here. It understandable on both side (this is a big change for ALL of the kids) but that doesn't make it right. She might be acting out because of all this change but that doesn't excuse her for coming into your rooms and taking things without permissions. That should be a common respect thing.  It's fine that you feel that way but I don't think you should say things to spite others.  I don't know what you're dad is doing but that y'all have a sit down and set boundaries so everyone knows how to respect each others lines.", "YTA. What you're doing is bullying. You're both technically kids and he's her father as much as yours. She has as much right to be there as you.

You are mad that your dad couldn't keep it in his pants. That is his fault, not hers. She is a child. She is acting out because she is going through a lot of turmoil. **You are doing the exact same thing.** Like it or not, she is your sibling.

Why are you punishing her for something that isn't in her control? \n\nSetting a boundary that you don't want her to come in and out of your room without permission didn't seem like an unreasonable request, but then you turn around and insist she just needs to leave.

I don\u2019t think she should go into your rooms, but as she said, your other siblings do it, so she probably thought it was okay. I think most of the resentment you have towards her is because your father had the affair, that is no way on her. She didn\u2019t ask to be born, and not under those circumstances.

I *know* this is hard on you, and you're going through a lot of turmoil right now. But put yourself in her shoes for five minutes. I don't know how much she knew your dad before now, but I'm guessing he was a minor presence in her life, if anything, due to the affair. She grew up not really getting to have him around due to circumstances out of her control and now is having to live with him even though she may not really even know him. And now her mom is in jail, which would be destabilizing enough, but she got thrown in a home where it's *four* against one. You all know and love each other and grew up with each other and due to, again, circumstances out of her control, y'all are set against her. She's just trying to find her place. She's probably acting really confident because she's actually terrified and insecure and not sure where she belongs. I know you're a kid, too, and that this situation is terribly unfair on you, but it'd be really amazing if you could try extending an olive branch and help her realize this is her home now, too. Not just a place she's being shuffled around to because nobody wants her.", "YTA.  What a horribly unkind person you are.", "I don't see why she feels entitled to steal your clothes and other things.

She could be taking you\u2019re clothes because she doesn\u2019t have any of her own. She literally had to leave her home and a lot of her stuff behind. Does she know how to do her own laundry? Y\u2019all are close to the same age. She\u2019s probably had to struggle and depend on herself for so long. And now she feels like an intruder in her new home and doesn\u2019t know how to ask for help. Does she fell comfortable enough to say \u201cHe dad I don\u2019t have any clean clothes. Or the close I have don\u2019t fit. Can we get please get me some new ones. \u201c And god forbid your dad actually goes and get her new stuff. Because I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll just use that as more ammunition against her.  Grow up this situation isn\u2019t fair for any of y\u2019all.", "Record her. I'm sure you have a phone. Record her and send the videos to your dad constantly. Can't deny what you're seeing for yourself. Just start randomly videoing her as soon as he walks out of the door. Not saying she needs to leave but something needs to be done", "ESH", "You're just as much his child as she is. He can easily kick you out for being an AH bully to your SISTER.\n\nYTA", "Well she\u2019s not going anywhere so you\u2019re going to have to find a way to deal with her.", "Part of growing up is learning that feelings can be totally 100% valid while our actions can be totally wrong.  Feelings don\u2019t make you a bad person. They don\u2019t have to be charitable or kind. They kind of happen to all of us and that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s what we do with them. That\u2019s where we hurt those around us.\n\nI get that your life has been turned upside down. I am so sorry you lost your mom. I am sorry you found out your dad cheated. I am sorry you have basically a stranger in your house, and you are being forced to share. It is not fair. Your *feelings* are valid.\n\nBut what you say and do is cruel and unnecessary. I want you to think back to last year. Let\u2019s pretend you didn\u2019t have your dad around or your siblings and you found yourself in a house with a new dad you didn\u2019t really know and his 4 kids who all seemed to hate you. They don\u2019t want to see you out of your room. They tell you to go away. But. You have nowhere to go. You are all alone in this world with a strange man who is now your dad and his kids don\u2019t want you around. \n\nShe didn\u2019t cheat on your mom. She had no choice but to move in. She isn\u2019t playing the victim, OP. She is the victim.  And you are being cruel. \n\nI don\u2019t give judgment to 16 year olds. I was no better at 16. But I think you can do better. You can kindly ask her not to touch your clothes without asking. You can start a knock-on-doors tradition. Maybe you can even extend a crumb of kindness sometime by inviting her to watch a show with you - you don\u2019t have to, but it would be nice.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be her friend or her sister. But you can find it in your heart to not be cruel.", "ESH.\n\nYou are displaying a stunning lack of empathy, which is not totally surprising given the situation and your age, but still, yikes. This girl grew up fatherless and probably in a bad situation, considering the reason she's now motherless is that her mom *is in prison*. She had to move in with an adult male stranger and his four kids who don't want her there, presumably having to move schools and leave every other familiar thing behind to do so. Could she be a jerk by nature? Of course. She could also be a really troubled kid who is pushing boundaries on purpose, and it's getting her the attention she craves.\n\nMore importantly, you're going about this all the wrong way. \"She needs to leave\" and \"in our own home\"? Girl, she's your father's legal responsibility, and it's her home now too. You don't get to say that. Hell, *he* doesn't even get to say that. Your dad is the one you should be really pissed at, because he's a cheater who let her grow up alone and you four ignorant of her, and now he's doing a shitty job parenting. \n\nAll you had to say was \"I understand that she's our half sister, but she's still a stranger to us. You wouldn't expect us to let any other stranger walk in and out of our rooms and touch our things, because that kind of trust takes a long time to build. All we're asking is that we all be allowed time to build that trust and begin seeing her as a sibling. And furthermore, if any of my brothers were taking my things without asking, they would no longer be allowed in my room either. That's a pretty basic boundary that she's repeatedly crossed. It's also really upsetting to us when she touches mom's things, because we have so little to remember her by, and those things really aren't related to her. They're precious to us, however, and we wish she would respect that and leave them alone. She still has a mother, but that's all we have left.\"\n\nIt may well be too late for her to turn into a decent sister-- there's a reason people hate fostering teenagers, and that's basically what she is, it's just they found her absent father instead of a stranger to be the foster-- but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. You could try to work with your dad and her to make things better, because I promise the route you're taking now will never have the effect you want. You've just alienated and pissed off both her and your dad while making him see her as the underdog even more, which means she can escalate her behavior with no consequences. \n\n\nAlso, y'all need family therapy. If your dad can afford a home with enough space for five kids to have their own rooms, he can afford a therapist. I'd start with suggesting that, actually.", "Everyone is AH here. Maybe you are a little bit of an AH for telling your half-sibling that you don\u2019t want her.  However, I get how you are feeling.  This girl is not just difficult in her behavior. She represents your father\u2019s infidelity to your mother and when he brings her to live in your house it must feel like a betrayal of you kids.\n\nBut it is not her fault. You are both unlucky to have the same defective dad.  \n\nMy main advice is you kids should insist on family therapy.  Only if your father gets help seeing the problems with the situation and support your need for boundaries can your family move forward.\n\nMeanwhile, make it clear that your sister can\u2019t go into your rooms uninvited, much less take your stuff.", "YTA. She has just as much of a right to be there. Your dad cheated not her. Yes her actions suck but she's coming into a situation with her siblings she doesn't know and I promise y'all are treatin' her ass too. Your anger is misplaced your dad did wrong not her. Where are you expecting her to go? It's bogus AF to tell someone to leave especially knowing her father is the one responsible for her and he wants her there.", "YTA for acting like a bully to a traumatized child. She belongs in her father\u2019s home, no ifs, ands, or buts. You cannot kick her out. Get a lock for your door if you don\u2019t want to share.", "YTA since this is clearly fiction. No 16 year old girl writes like this.", "ESH\n\nWell more like the situation you\u2019re all in sucks and unlike you your half sister doesn\u2019t have a support system or really anyone besides your dad, which explains the favoritism. She\u2019s also the one who had to move in into a house with hostile strangers, aka you and your siblings, who don\u2019t want her around. Despite her attitude she\u2019s also a traumatized kid who probably doesn\u2019t even want to be there as much as you don\u2019t want her around, but you\u2019re all stuck together. So you can either continue to be hostile or actually get professional help and learn how to coexist.", "Is this a repost?", "Ultimately, it's not Your house to be telling another Minor Child that they \"need to find somewhere else to live.\" It's quite frankly not your place to do that unless YOU are the one paying all the bills.  Further, until She's 18, it's not necessarily her choice. \n\nThat said.... You should not have to put up with this. Your Dad needs to step up and actually behave like a responsible parent. You and your siblings need to be able to lock her out of your rooms. He needs to adress both her attitude and her behavior - and look into some counselling for her, and probably the family as a group. \n\nI'm going with ESH all the way around.", "The only person who sucks and is the ah here is the adult, which is your father.", "maybe you should take your anger out on your dad who can\u2019t keep his pants up instead of this girl. she didn\u2019t create this situation, he did.", "Ask your dad if you can all go to family therapy so everyone feels supported in the transition. The therapist will help everyone involved.", "ESH \n\nTalk to your dad about putting a lock on your bedroom door.  Your sibs should have one too.  Including your half-sib.\n\nYou all should be in counseling to deal with this.  This is a HUGE change in your life.    HUGE.     All of you need a neutral place to discuss the issues and work things out.\n\nYour dad is probably overwhelmed at having a new child in his life.  Did he know about her before she moved in??   She is totally traumatized - first, having a parent who is a felon.  Second, being moved into a place she doesn't know, with people she doesn't know, in a school she doesn't know.   With a mother who has such poor coping skills that she is a felon, your half-sib probably has never seen how normal people interact with each other - other than in movies/TV.   She needs counseling to learn how to interact like a non-felon.\n\nYou and your brothers should go to your father and talk to him about family counseling.  The entire family needs it.  She may even need one-on-one counseling in addition to the family counseling to deal with her mom being sent to jail.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS ANYWHERE", "ESH\nWe have a deceased mother, an incarcerated mother, an adulterous father, and a home full of children who were forced into this situation.

She\u2019s a traumatized child with nowhere else to go and her newly met half-siblings are not thrilled to have her there. It\u2019s not surprising that some of her behaviors are a little hard to take right now or that she\u2019s going to your dad for attention - her only friendly face in the house.
