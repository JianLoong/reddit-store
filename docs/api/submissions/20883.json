This is something you should know about your gf.", "YTA. \n\nIt's not about how bizarre it is she didn't know about the invasion, but how you are speaking to your girlfriend.  Instead of simply educating her you decided to belittle her and it's apparent in every single quote you included of what you said to her. It's ridiculous that she hasn't heard about it, but you don't have to make her feel like an idiot, especially if you care about her.  You were an ass.", "YTA. What an entitled jerk you are.", "YTA\nSo what if she didn\u2019t see any news or social media about it. How is that her fault? Do you expect her to go read up on current events or turn on CNN at the right time? Maybe her social media feed isn\u2019t the same as yours. Not everyone knows everything going on in the world, big news or not. Do you know what the number 1 Youtube video is right now? Why not? It\u2019s easily accessible right? \n\nI understand if you were confused how she didn\u2019t know.
