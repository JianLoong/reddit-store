Well, we also have a very large dog and because he isn\u2019t well trained on a leash it\u2019s really hard for me to take him out with our two LOs. I try to take him out when the kids are down for a nap, etc but I specifically told my husband that he needs to make it his responsibility to walk our dog before and after work, as well as later in the evening. He agrees to it but it doesn\u2019t get done. Instead, my husband allows the dog out onto the patio to urinate and poop on the deck and sometimes the poop sits there for days before he cleans it up. So, after I spent my hard energy cleaning the entire deck I told my husband that the dog is no longer allowed to use the bathroom out there. It\u2019s unsanitary, it\u2019s gross to look at, pretty sure our neighbors can smell the poop sitting in the hot sun. I thought I made it clear because he again agreed with me that what I was saying was right and he wouldn\u2019t let it happen. Not even two days later, I see my husband letting our dog out to use the bathroom!!! Mind you, I asked him not even 10 minutes prior to take our dog out to use the bathroom!! Y\u2019all, I flipped my cool and got very angry that he was disrespecting my wishes and literally shitting on the work I put into providing a nice clean outdoor space for our family to enjoy. He goes on to tell me I\u2019m overreacting and that it\u2019s just a small poop, etc. I\u2019m not buying it and am getting incredibly frustrated he wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge my feelings or hard work. Now, because I\u2019m overreacting my husband starts to call me names I absolutely despise (c u next Tuesday) and it sets me off even more to the point where I\u2019ve now become a raging maniac. He proceeds to tell me how crazy I\u2019m acting over dog shit but I told him it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s the blatant disrespect to me and he doesn\u2019t seem to get that. So, AITA??

That\u2019s a shit ton of work above just the daily dog shit you have to deal with because he doesn\u2019t care enough about you to do anything about it.\n\nGoogle \u201cwalk away syndrome\u201d \n\n\nSauce: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reasons-women-leave-their-marriages-according-to-marriage-therapists_n_579fc7b9e4b0e2e15eb6ea31/amp", "NTA\n\nHon, you\u2019re not overreacting. You\u2019re UNDER-reacting. Majorly. \n\nWhy do you put up with a husband who treats you this?", "NTA. Y\u2019all have kids, and having a turd spattered deck is unsanitary and unsafe. Not to mention the urine will ruin any finish on the deck and rot the wood. I can\u2019t imagine the smell. How lazy your husband is. And how verbally abusive. He calls you c\\*nt? He\u2019s the one with kids surrounded by animal poop, and a dog he won\u2019t take care of properly.\n\nTurdbasket Hubby. He is an AH!", "NTA.\n\nHE is the lazy bastard who won't clean it up or do anything about it. You guys have 2 babies who could potentially be crawling around in that literal shit? Heck no.", "Why do you have a dog? NTA in this case, but you are both for having a dog and not caring for it", "NTA.\n\nOur dog craps in our garden fairly often, usually first thing in the morning before a walk and last thing before bed, we pick it up straight away.\nEven before we had a child, the idea of anyone stepping in dog shit in our own garden is just disgusting", "NTA.  You may want to read Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft.  You can find it for free online.", "You\u2019re not overreacting, and there\u2019s really no excuse for him calling you those names. He\u2019s fucking lazy. He\u2019s not pulling his weight. He\u2019s making your life harder. NTA", "Sorry what?! Your entitled misogynistic husband called you names for rightfully protesting about something. \n\nWow. \n\nI'd be more than raging at this point \n\nNTA", "Shit in his sock drawer and tell him it just a little one.", "Lock him out on the patio with a pillow, blanket and the dog for the night. See if that changes his tune.", "NTA but respect yourself more. You know he\u2019s the AH here and you need to seriously consider if you want to stay in this relationship.", "When she leaves him, he will be all she just up and left me over some dog poop.", "Ok, but this is the man she chose to marry.", "NTA", "I just cannot comprehend this. Yes, pets and kids will occasionally dump excrement where you don\u2019t want it, but you clean that shit immediately and take steps that it won\u2019t happen again. \n\nThe idea that you could just encourage a dog to hog on a patio and leave it for your kids to play in, your wife to clean up, and let the whole structure rot is completely beyond me. I\u2019m not the world\u2019s tidiest person, and I cannot comprehend this.", "The dog can be retrained. It\u2019s a dog, it doesn\u2019t understand there are rules. \n\nHusband? Not so sure. He\u2019s a grown adult with a functioning brain who is deliberately ignoring his obligations.", "NTA. You've got three kids and a dog, none of which respect or listen to you (well, I don't know about the actual kids, but constant attention doesn't sound very promising). Take the dog to obedience training, get some marriage counseling to sort out this abuse from the partner, and hire a maid/nanny/helper for a few times a week. You're not the house slave. You're a person who deserves more out of life than fighting over dog poop on the deck. I wish better times for you ahead. And it doesn't go without saying, I get why a sahm would maybe feel like they are trapped or have to put up with *shit* because their partner pays for everything. But they don't. Calculate the amount of money a 24 hour babysitter plus dog sitter plus cook plus housecleaner plus housekeeper plus chauffeur would cost. You're actually doing way more work and are worth more than a 40 hr job worker.", "If the dog isn\u2019t being taken out properly to poop, it\u2019s not being walked either.  Why do you have a dog, if it\u2019s not being exercised properly? And why isn\u2019t your husband walking it, if you aren\u2019t able to control it?  Why hasn\u2019t it been trained properly?  It sounds like you don\u2019t need a dog and aren\u2019t caring for it.  The dog deserves much better.  You\u2019re NTA for the situation at hand, but E S H for having a dog and not properly caring for it.  Give the dog to someone who will train it and allow it a yard to poop in and proper walks.", "YES, YES, YES! So your husband is good with having a very large dog who isn't leash trained that YOU get to handle, even though he's too strong for you, and that you have to walk while the kids are napping? Alone in the house? THEN he is all good with letting the patio that his children play on be covered in poop, which stinks to high heaven, THEN, THEN, he calls you foul names because you ask him to clean up after the dog? Do I have this right?", "Are you married to my husband?", "NTA- why is no one talking about how abusive this relationship is? 1) He calls you names 2) he shits on your hard work (almost literally) 3) he makes promises he doesn't keep 4) he is lazy to the point it causes more work for you 5) he doesn't take your feelings seriously \n\nI hope you realize you deserve more than whatever bare minimum this is, if not for yourself than for your kids.", "NTA your husband sounds like doesn\u2019t give a shit and it almost looks as if he\u2019s trying to push you to go for a divorce", "NTA.

It\u2019s time to start thinking about who you can prepare for your net stage in your life. It\u2019s not a giant leap that someone who is verbally abusive, manipulative, and dismissive toward you will escalate to physical violence. Then after that, what\u2019s to stop him from hurting your kids? I\u2019m not saying those things are a sure thing. I\u2019m saying there are enough concerns here that you need a plan, just in case.", "NTA. Time to start revenge shitting on his pillow? If he overreacts tell him it's just a small poop.", "Your children are watching this behavior. It will become normal to them if you let it continue", "This. I was reading it also thinking to myself, how does she even think she is the AH in this situation? And then turning around and completely gaslighting her and calling her names? \n\nOn top of everything you said from A-D, I would also let the dog keep shitting on the deck and leave it there for him. Eventually he will realize she\u2019s not cleaning up after him and call her some more names.", "Yup! That is 100% right.", "What does that mean?", "This I can confirm,  my dog jumps the fence and poops in my neighbours yard .", "What exactly is your point with that comment?", "Omg yes.

I will take both of them off your neighbor\u2019s hands.", "NTA.\nMy abusive ex-husband used to call me a Can't Understand Normal Thinking all the time. \n\nHe's gaslighting you. You are asking us if you're the asshole when he is definitely, without a doubt TA. He's got you questioning your actions and morals. You know poop on the deck is gross and that he isn't being a good owner to your puppers. \n\nMaybe start journaling these types of incidents? If there are a lot of them you may want to consider couples therapy. He shouldn't treat any of his family members that way. He knows that. That's why he got pissed at you.", "NTA. Your husband is disgusting and he doesn't respect you. I'd take the kids and leave", "NTA. All the stuff before the name calling is just pure laziness and yes ma\u2019am sweet talk. The name calling; crazy, and the other word if ANY man ever said to me would find my knee in there genitals, are NOT ok. This man does not respect you. Period. Are you happy with that? If the answer is yes, then you are allowing it and should just get comfy. Because the ride will be bumpy. If you don\u2019t like it, then don\u2019t stand for it. Once he loses you, he will get it.", "Jesus Christ. \n\nNTA. Not even a little bit. I don\u2019t even like it when the dog goes to the bathroom too close to the house - we\u2019ve trained her to use the perimeter of the yard. \n\nBut the dog isn\u2019t the issue here.

NTA and that alone is unacceptable.\n\nAlso, hey, OP's husband... WALK YOUR FUCKING DOG it takes 5 fucking minutes.", "NTA at all. And the \u201cc\u201d word is a big no for me. The husband sounds lazy, disrespectful and awful in a lot of ways, but the \u201cc\u201d word would not be said twice. Nope.", "Your husband is abusive.  I know Reddit loves to say that but calling you names is abuse.   Consider leaving for a healthy relationship.  You may not have your own money as a SAHM but the court will order child support and possibly maintenance for you.   Good luck", "NTA... He is being a lazy AH. INFO: how much harder is it for him to take the dog off of the deck to an appropriate place?", "NTA. Have shovel, will travel.", "SMH\n\nImagine for a second if a guy posted a rant talking about how he \"told\" his wife to do something.", "NTA for all the reasons mentioned above. I agree with others, both dog and husband might need to take a hike.\n\nI would also like to add, very gently, that referring to yourself as \"maniac\" and \"psycho\" for being upset/angry may be due to internalized misogyny. \n\nMen frequently call women \"crazy\" when we have emotions that are inconvenient to them, or in opposition to what the man wants or thinks is important. Men call us \"crazy\" to dismiss and delegitimize our concerns and emotions.  \n\nHaving a strong emotion and expressing it in a situationally appropriate manner isn't crazy or psycho, it's part of being human and being yourself. I wonder if all the name calling and being dismissed, ignored and disrespected by your husband has affected how you see yourself?", "It is utterly disgusting that he lets your dog shit on your patio. You are NTA, not even close. \nIf taking the dog out is an issue, they make little doggy potty grass patches with the removable tray underneath, you can pick up the poop, hose off the grass, dump the pee tray, and it's a designated spot for your dog, not just shit and piss strewn everywhere. These are designed for apartment patios when you don't have a yard and the baby is sleeping etc but can work well in a pinch for useless A-hole husbands who are too lazy to take care of their responsibilities.", "NTA... NTA...N....T....A.... I'd flip shit too. \n\nYour husband needs to A) STOP acting like a child and calling someone he is supposed to LOVE horrible disgusting names because HE is called on his B.S. and B) he needs to grow up and follow through with his promises he made.", "OP, you do need to calm down.  \n\n1) What are the consequences if he lets the dog out to shit on the patio?  Do you tell him that next time you'll take it and put it in his garage? his boat? his motorcycle helmet?  If there are no consequences then he won't stop.  Will you re-home the dog if he can't take responsibility?  That said, these threats just escalate the situation.\n\n2) The real answer is that you and he need to learn to communicate effectively. He needs to stop the name calling and talk to you with respect and you need to stop screaming and talk to him with respect. I know, easier said than done.  I personally will not have a conversation with someone who calls me names. It is rare, a long time ago and now I only have friendly respectful people in my life.\n\n3) When you are both calmer, sit down, apologize for screaming and ask him what he thinks the best way to solve this is?  What are the consequences if he doesn't do what he says he'll do ... because it is tough to have a marriage where you can't trust the other to do as they promise. \n\nIf you can afford it, take a class on good relationship communication.", "I agree with all this and I'm kind of wondering about this dog situation. It sounds like the dog is basically untrained and they've allowed it to make the habit of pooping on the deck. I'm wondering how old this dog is, who got the dog, what training they've done, if there's a yard the dog can run around in since it isn't getting walked regularly, etc.", "Holy shit your husband! You are NTA and reasonable! Who lets their dog poop on a deck!!!!!

Suits your profile name.. you know Love bombing is an abuser strategy?", "You mean letting the dog shit where it wants, calling his wife a c\u00d7nt? Those kids are going to be a catch for somebody someday..", "Because she \u201coverreacted\u201d\u2026 The gaslighting has been working too well for too long if she thinks this was the case. She shouldn\u2019t have put up with thus for as long as she did because now he feels entitled to his childish laziness.", "Plus it means the dog isn\u2019t likely to be getting any of the required exercise that it needs.", "They replied to a commenter marked with a cake next to their name because it\u2019s their reddit accounts birthday.", "Nothing better than playing a move and them going \"ohhhhhh you bitch\" while cackling that you know you totally screwed over their plans. And we both know it's in jest, like a \"I love how evil you are right now, I'm freaking ruined\" way.\n\nNothing worse (well some things worse) than being called a bitch in a non joking manner, in an argument.", "That everything bad that happens is a woman\u2019s fault. Deadbeat dad? Well why did you have a kid with him then. Lazy husband? You need to teach him how to do it. Gross uncaring mean husband? Why\u2019d you marry him. Like instead of saying wtf this guy is gross, she should have foreseen this happening and not married him at all. \ud83e\udd2e"]}
