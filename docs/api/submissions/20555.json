The other day, I finally grew tired of looking at our scummy patio deck and decided to pressure wash it. I managed to do it all in a day by myself while still taking care of our two children whom need constant attention. Well, we also have a very large dog and because he isn\u2019t well trained on a leash it\u2019s really hard for me to take him out with our two LOs. I try to take him out when the kids are down for a nap, etc but I specifically told my husband that he needs to make it his responsibility to walk our dog before and after work, as well as later in the evening. He agrees to it but it doesn\u2019t get done. Instead, my husband allows the dog out onto the patio to urinate and poop on the deck and sometimes the poop sits there for days before he cleans it up. So, after I spent my hard energy cleaning the entire deck I told my husband that the dog is no longer allowed to use the bathroom out there. It\u2019s unsanitary, it\u2019s gross to look at, pretty sure our neighbors can smell the poop sitting in the hot sun. I thought I made it clear because he again agreed with me that what I was saying was right and he wouldn\u2019t let it happen. Not even two days later, I see my husband letting our dog out to use the bathroom!!! Mind you, I asked him not even 10 minutes prior to take our dog out to use the bathroom!! Y\u2019all, I flipped my cool and got very angry that he was disrespecting my wishes and literally shitting on the work I put into providing a nice clean outdoor space for our family to enjoy. He goes on to tell me I\u2019m overreacting and that it\u2019s just a small poop, etc. I\u2019m not buying it and am getting incredibly frustrated he wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge my feelings or hard work. Now, because I\u2019m overreacting my husband starts to call me names I absolutely despise (c u next Tuesday) and it sets me off even more to the point where I\u2019ve now become a raging maniac. He proceeds to tell me how crazy I\u2019m acting over dog shit but I told him it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s the blatant disrespect to me and he doesn\u2019t seem to get that. So, AITA??

The dog sounds miserable. Untrained is a reason to follow dog training, not a reason to not take him out. Take a class if possible, otherwise watch some YouTube videos. You have no business having a dog you cannot take out and your husband won't take out. \n\nEither get the dog trained or get the dog a proper home. Because option number 3, getting your husband to do his share is not working.", "He gets it, he just doesn\u2019t wanna deal with the dog.

Don't let that happen. Go to counseling if it gets that far, but under no circumstances should this man- who married you, and who claims to love you- be calling you vulgar names to distract from his pathetic failures.", "NTA divorce.

You\u2019re in an agreement with your partner and if he fails to do the things he agreed upon, it\u2019s his fault. Also he\u2019s such an a-hole for calling you the c word just for being sanitary and for providing a nice and clean area in your home. Though I will say, when you decide to have a dog, it\u2019s your responsibility as a family to train them and to familiarize your house to them so they\u2019ll be able to adapt and not sh*t in the patio at the first place.

There\u2019s a specific corner they seem to be having a territory squabble over. It drives me nuts how hard that mess is to clean and disinfect. Pressure wash was the only thing that did the trick. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine having your dog be allowed to do this regularly. \n\nBut the real marriage breaker for me would be having a husband who calls me the vile names your husband calls you.  In well over 30 years with my husband as a married couple and a long term dating couple, he has never called me a foul name. Ever.

Please consider rehoming the dog.", "NTA, someone else reminded me of a very good point regarding the safety of it. My brother lost one of his eyes when he was 12 because of a parasite that lives in canine feces. Once it gets into the human system it migrates to the optic nerve and eats the eye.

As much as I hate to suggest this, maybe rehome the dog if he won't care enough about his children's health to bother even after you show him all of this.", "NTA - and he's disgusting and lazy.

I have a dog and walk him in rain, snow, migraine, cramps, hangover,  etc. Don't get a dog if you can't take care of their basic fucking necessities. Dogs don't even like pooping in their spaces/homes, they survey areas and find specific spots. I bet even the dog is grossed out by the hot poop left out for days.", "Letting the dog use the patio as a bathroom is strike 1. Calling me a cunt is strike 2 & 3 - he\u2019s outttt. I would 100% tell him to kick rocks and contemplate divorce.", "Re-home the husband", "No, what you do in this situation is get couples counseling or dump the husband.

The only time we call each other names is when we're playing a board/card game and we KNOW it's in jest, and then it's reserved for a spectacular move, and then it's basically an honor to get called a bitch/bastard.", "NTA Exactly! Has he apologized for calling you names? He\u2019s so lazy he can\u2019t take your (as in his dog for a walk too for a walk?)  It\u2019s not unreasonable to want to live in a clean healthy environment and why he doesn\u2019t want that for himself is a red flag. You deserve respect and I agree with this poster about the divorce. If these are patterns of behaviour not a one time thing, which is still not ok, and I suspect that it is a frequent laziness and nastiness towards you. Sounds like your doing it all on your own anyway. Take care and good luck, you got this. Your dog and kids are lucky to have you.", "If my husband called me that he'd be looking at a very difficult life going forward.  I don't do laundry or clean or cook for someone who uses such language at me.", "Maybe he could stay on the porch with the shit, he won\u2019t clean up."]}
