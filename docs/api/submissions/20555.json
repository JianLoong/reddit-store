Well, we also have a very large dog and because he isn\u2019t well trained on a leash it\u2019s really hard for me to take him out with our two LOs. I try to take him out when the kids are down for a nap, etc but I specifically told my husband that he needs to make it his responsibility to walk our dog before and after work, as well as later in the evening. He agrees to it but it doesn\u2019t get done. Instead, my husband allows the dog out onto the patio to urinate and poop on the deck and sometimes the poop sits there for days before he cleans it up. So, after I spent my hard energy cleaning the entire deck I told my husband that the dog is no longer allowed to use the bathroom out there. It\u2019s unsanitary, it\u2019s gross to look at, pretty sure our neighbors can smell the poop sitting in the hot sun. I thought I made it clear because he again agreed with me that what I was saying was right and he wouldn\u2019t let it happen. Not even two days later, I see my husband letting our dog out to use the bathroom!!! Mind you, I asked him not even 10 minutes prior to take our dog out to use the bathroom!! Y\u2019all, I flipped my cool and got very angry that he was disrespecting my wishes and literally shitting on the work I put into providing a nice clean outdoor space for our family to enjoy. He goes on to tell me I\u2019m overreacting and that it\u2019s just a small poop, etc. I\u2019m not buying it and am getting incredibly frustrated he wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge my feelings or hard work. Now, because I\u2019m overreacting my husband starts to call me names I absolutely despise (c u next Tuesday) and it sets me off even more to the point where I\u2019ve now become a raging maniac. He proceeds to tell me how crazy I\u2019m acting over dog shit but I told him it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s the blatant disrespect to me and he doesn\u2019t seem to get that. So, AITA??

This causes resentment and rightfully so. And that kills marriages.\n\nIf his go-to response is calling you names and crazy, then decide if you want to put in the heavy workload of fixing the marriage (because he won\u2019t)  and getting therapy. That\u2019s a shit ton of work above just the daily dog shit you have to deal with because he doesn\u2019t care enough about you to do anything about it.\n\nGoogle \u201cwalk away syndrome\u201d \n\n\nSauce: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reasons-women-leave-their-marriages-according-to-marriage-therapists_n_579fc7b9e4b0e2e15eb6ea31/amp", "NTA\n\nHon, you\u2019re not overreacting. You\u2019re UNDER-reacting. Majorly. \n\nWhy do you put up with a husband who treats you this?", "NTA. Y\u2019all have kids, and having a turd spattered deck is unsanitary and unsafe. Not to mention the urine will ruin any finish on the deck and rot the wood. I can\u2019t imagine the smell. How lazy your husband is. And how verbally abusive. He calls you c\\*nt? He\u2019s the one with kids surrounded by animal poop, and a dog he won\u2019t take care of properly.\n\nTurdbasket Hubby. He is an AH!", "NTA.\n\nHE is the lazy bastard who won't clean it up or do anything about it. You guys have 2 babies who could potentially be crawling around in that literal shit? Heck no.", "Why do you have a dog? NTA in this case, but you are both for having a dog and not caring for it", "NTA.\n\nOur dog craps in our garden fairly often, usually first thing in the morning before a walk and last thing before bed, we pick it up straight away.\nEven before we had a child, the idea of anyone stepping in dog shit in our own garden is just disgusting", "NTA.  You may want to read Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft.  You can find it for free online.", "You\u2019re not overreacting, and there\u2019s really no excuse for him calling you those names. He\u2019s fucking lazy. He\u2019s not pulling his weight. He\u2019s making your life harder. NTA", "Sorry what?! Your entitled misogynistic husband called you names for rightfully protesting about something. \n\nWow. \n\nI'd be more than raging at this point \n\nNTA", "Shit in his sock drawer and tell him it just a little one.", "Lock him out on the patio with a pillow, blanket and the dog for the night. See if that changes his tune.", "NTA but respect yourself more. You know he\u2019s the AH here and you need to seriously consider if you want to stay in this relationship.", "When she leaves him, he will be all she just up and left me over some dog poop.", "Ok, but this is the man she chose to marry.", "NTA", "I just cannot comprehend this. Yes, pets and kids will occasionally dump excrement where you don\u2019t want it, but you clean that shit immediately and take steps that it won\u2019t happen again. \n\nThe idea that you could just encourage a dog to hog on a patio and leave it for your kids to play in, your wife to clean up, and let the whole structure rot is completely beyond me. I\u2019m not the world\u2019s tidiest person, and I cannot comprehend this.", "The dog can be retrained. It\u2019s a dog, it doesn\u2019t understand there are rules. \n\nHusband? Not so sure. He\u2019s a grown adult with a functioning brain who is deliberately ignoring his obligations."]}
