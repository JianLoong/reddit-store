The other day, I finally grew tired of looking at our scummy patio deck and decided to pressure wash it. I managed to do it all in a day by myself while still taking care of our two children whom need constant attention. Well, we also have a very large dog and because he isn\u2019t well trained on a leash it\u2019s really hard for me to take him out with our two LOs. I try to take him out when the kids are down for a nap, etc but I specifically told my husband that he needs to make it his responsibility to walk our dog before and after work, as well as later in the evening. He agrees to it but it doesn\u2019t get done. Instead, my husband allows the dog out onto the patio to urinate and poop on the deck and sometimes the poop sits there for days before he cleans it up. So, after I spent my hard energy cleaning the entire deck I told my husband that the dog is no longer allowed to use the bathroom out there. It\u2019s unsanitary, it\u2019s gross to look at, pretty sure our neighbors can smell the poop sitting in the hot sun. I thought I made it clear because he again agreed with me that what I was saying was right and he wouldn\u2019t let it happen. Not even two days later, I see my husband letting our dog out to use the bathroom!!! Mind you, I asked him not even 10 minutes prior to take our dog out to use the bathroom!! Y\u2019all, I flipped my cool and got very angry that he was disrespecting my wishes and literally shitting on the work I put into providing a nice clean outdoor space for our family to enjoy. He goes on to tell me I\u2019m overreacting and that it\u2019s just a small poop, etc. I\u2019m not buying it and am getting incredibly frustrated he wouldn\u2019t even acknowledge my feelings or hard work. Now, because I\u2019m overreacting my husband starts to call me names I absolutely despise (c u next Tuesday) and it sets me off even more to the point where I\u2019ve now become a raging maniac. He proceeds to tell me how crazy I\u2019m acting over dog shit but I told him it\u2019s more than that, it\u2019s the blatant disrespect to me and he doesn\u2019t seem to get that. So, AITA??

But that means that the poor dog doesn't get the care and the activities that he need and deserve. \n\nI own two dogs. They rarely poo in the yard because I do walk them or bike with them daily ! And it is a yard, not a deck. Anyway, they wait to go outside the property. But sometimes they end up to do it in the yard, in front of the gate, specially at the moment where I'm changing the schedule to avoid hot hours. And when they do, I clean up right away, as it smells, attract flies,...\n\nAlso,  a man letting dog shit outside to dry in a house were you have children and todlers is a shame of a dad, for the example he's settling but more importantly for the risk of any children playing with it or tasting it.\n\nNTA but yeah, the dog shit IS definitely a problem in itself, but it may be the least of your problem with your husband.

It is absolutely disgusting to allow your dog to use your patio/deck as a bathroom. Dog poop can transmit hookworm, giardia, parvovirus, E. coli , and Salmonella, some of which can be transferred to humans, especially the little ones who\u2019s hand hygiene may be less than ideal. We had a neighbor who used to do the same thing, and just FYI, we took photos and told everyone in the neighborhood how disgusting they were. Your husband is an AH. If he won\u2019t walk the dog, then hire someone to come do it for you during the day.
