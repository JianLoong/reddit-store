He found an old, unfinished bottle of antibiotics which were prescribed to him by his doctor a few months ago. He is no longer sick- it was not a very serious illness and he recovered fine. He does not currently have symptoms of any other illness. Without consulting his doctor, he decided that it would be a good idea to just finish taking the rest of the antibiotics now because why not, it'll be preventative of other illness.  \n\n\nI think this is stupid. Based on what I've read/heard about antibiotics best practice, you should always finish your full prescription even if you start to feel better within the prescribed timeline. The reason for this, as I understand, is because while you might feel better you might still have some lingering stuff going on. Not doing so is bad because it can allow the disease to grow resistant to the antibiotics. \n\nSo to me, my boyfriend has already committed one error by not finishing these in the first place. And now he is just making it worse by taking antibiotics he has 0 need for now.\n\nHe insists he should take them. A day or two after we argued about whether he should finish the antibiotics or not-  I saw them in the bathroom. I threw them out since I think he's just misusing medicine at this point and only harm will come of it. He was angry when he discovered the antibiotics were missing.\n\nI think I might be TA because it's not my medication, it's his and it is probably not actually a big deal.

Honey, your boyfriend is an idiot.", "He's an idiot and you're the asshole", "I mean NTA really because antibiotic resistance is a serious thing but you really shouldn't go throwing out peoples stuff without permission.", "ESH. He's wrong and shouldn't randomly take antibiotics month after the fact, but he's an adult, you overstepped majorly.", "He\u2019s a plonker a for taking them BUT this one time will not cause him to be antibiotic resistant. Chill out . Yes he\u2019s a gimp but you\u2019ve over reacted and decided for him . Controlling behaviour from yourself.", "NTA", "NTA they will do Nothing beneficial to him at this point. They WILL kill all the good bacteria and microbes your body naturally produces and lower your body\u2019s natural immunity. This is NOT good health practice and you were a good person for throwing them away. Good lord call your doctor and ask, they\u2019ll tell you this. Antibiotics fight specific bacteria, and they wipe the beneficial bacteria out in your body, taking them when you\u2019re not sick will do no good. When you\u2019re fighting an illness, and the bacteria is over competing your body, then they are necessary and helpful. As a healthy human just taking them out of the blue will not help you.", "ESH you\u2019re right. He should have finished it and half a prescription of antibiotics isn\u2019t a good treatment for a self-diagnosed future illness. But you overstepped. If he wants to put stupid shit into his body that\u2019s his choice. If you don\u2019t like his stupidity don\u2019t be his girlfriend. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "ESH.  Yes, you are an AH for throwing out something that wasn\u2019t yours. Even more so since it was done in an effort to control your boyfriend\u2019s behavior.  He is an AH for exactly the reasons you stated regarding antibiotics.  You are correct, but your actions nonetheless weren\u2019t right.", "NTA - It is really idiotic and irresponsible for him to take them again without the doctor's orders and taking too many antibiotics or taking them when you don't need it is harmful. You were just trying to prevent harm so you are NTA. He needs to go to the doctor.", "NTA - you shouldn\u2019t throw out other people\u2019s property but he was being a dummy by not taking them properly in the first place. Antibiotic resistance is a huge issue in the medical community so he shouldn\u2019t take them for shits & giggles now. \n\n\nAlso, don\u2019t store any medication in the bathroom!", "I'm going NTA. I don't know much about medicine either, but with a quick Google search it said you're not supposed to do that. Even without the search don't take medicine you're not supposed to take. Why would he even do that, it's not like they'll get him high. He's just reckless for no reason.\n\nEdit: OP you are not controlling or overstepping by preventing someone you love and care for from harming themselves. What he is doing is dangerous and I don't see how it differs from hiding knives from children since your bf clearly doesn't know better. If not letting your bf self-destruct is a boundary then break it down or leave, but don't just watch.", "ESH. He is an adult and should be able to make his own decisions. But, you have now learned some valuable information about your BF. At least with respect to this issue, he is a moron.", "YTA it\u2019s not your property and even though your bf sounds like an idiot it\u2019s not your place to throw out his medication.", "ESH. He is wrong. But throwing them out seems extreme when you could simply have explained more clearly. It was not yours, no matter how in the wrong he is.", "Your both dumb, he is clearly wrong, but YTA for sure", "As you suspected, YTA", "NTA because contrary to people saying his stupidity is confined to his body in this case, superbugs are a problem because they affect the whole population. it's an entire world problem", "Antibiotics have one of the highest rates of non compliance. People start to feel better and stop taking them. He is TA for not taking the full course.", "YTA. I agree it's best for him and perhaps society if he doesn't take those antibiotics, but you're a controlling arse for throwing away his property against his wishes, and for treating him like a child by overriding his decisions about what to do with his own body.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
