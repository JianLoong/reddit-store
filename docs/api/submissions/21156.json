Based on what I've read/heard about antibiotics best practice, you should always finish your full prescription even if you start to feel better within the prescribed timeline. The reason for this, as I understand, is because while you might feel better you might still have some lingering stuff going on. Not doing so is bad because it can allow the disease to grow resistant to the antibiotics. \n\nSo to me, my boyfriend has already committed one error by not finishing these in the first place. And now he is just making it worse by taking antibiotics he has 0 need for now.\n\nHe insists he should take them. A day or two after we argued about whether he should finish the antibiotics or not-  I saw them in the bathroom. I threw them out since I think he's just misusing medicine at this point and only harm will come of it. He was angry when he discovered the antibiotics were missing.\n\nI think I might be TA because it's not my medication, it's his and it is probably not actually a big deal.

They WILL kill all the good bacteria and microbes your body naturally produces and lower your body\u2019s natural immunity. This is NOT good health practice and you were a good person for throwing them away. Good lord call your doctor and ask, they\u2019ll tell you this. Antibiotics fight specific bacteria, and they wipe the beneficial bacteria out in your body, taking them when you\u2019re not sick will do no good.

You are correct, but your actions nonetheless weren\u2019t right.", "NTA - It is really idiotic and irresponsible for him to take them again without the doctor's orders and taking too many antibiotics or taking them when you don't need it is harmful.

Why would he even do that, it's not like they'll get him high. He's just reckless for no reason.\n\nEdit: OP you are not controlling or overstepping by preventing someone you love and care for from harming themselves. What he is doing is dangerous and I don't see how it differs from hiding knives from children since your bf clearly doesn't know better.

This is not at all like a situation such as euthanasia, abortion, vasectomy etc. or any other scenario where of course a person's bodily autonomy needs to be respected. In this scenario, there was no irreversible decision made by OP that irreversibly affected the guy's health. The antibiotics were not something that the guy needed. Technically, his decision to take more antibiotics wasn't taken away because if he wants to, the guy can always get more of the antibiotics again and take them as he was planning to do (not something I would recommend lol).
