Can you eat the food we bought you guys instead of touching ours?\" She gives me an attitude and says \"this is my fridge. My mom said I could.\" Rolls her eyes and walks off.

Does she know what ownership is?\n\nNTA.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou live on their land, use their fridge, ...   and cause drama abourt a few skieces of ham.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLeave, if you do not like ther generous hospitality.", "NTA but are you also the people using sil bathroom and the chores etc?

They need to raise their kid better and teach her basic human empathy and understanding of others.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL is replacing the food.\n\nConversation could have gone better.\n\nYour neice is an asshole.", "NTA\n\nYour food was clearly marked", "We have ordered a new camper fridge and it's due to come in tomorrow, thankfully.", "It's labeled and the niece knows it's theirs. 8 lbs of ham isn't cheap.", "That's great. I also kind of lol'd when you said SIL said are really going to be complaining over a child eating. Like, um, yes??? She is the one who literally suggested you use her fridge and write a note on your items AND you bought them $400 worth of food. So, yes mam, I completely expect for you and your child not to touch the food I bought, haha", "I wanted to say that to her but I felt like I couldn't because we do have our camper parked on her land so technically speaking she is helping us out lol but I just thought that was insane. Like why tell me to label my food and why did I just buy you guys $400 worth of food if you were just going to eat ours?", "How tf does that work out? You spent $400 on food but save on the rental charges? Fuck them. Go stay at the parks, this is stupid smh", "NTA They literally told you to label your food so it wasn't disturbed and then give you attitude for enforcing the rule they set?  I hope you can get out of there soon.", "Not the asshole. Your sil and daughter have a shit attitude and you bought them 400 dollars of food then they still eat your food. \nUngrateful brats they are", "Lol love how the default defence is always \u201cBut they\u2019re a child\u201d. \n\nShe\u2019s 13, not 5.\n\nBrats gonna be bratting. \n\nNTA", "NTA probably should move on they're obviously done hosting you and your camper on their land.

It\u2019s more than that and your SIL knows what your niece is doing. NTA", "Why is this being posted again. I have seen this exact posting multiple times already. I think you got your answer.", "NTA but why are you buying them food? Just stop and lock up your food.", "Are park fees more expensive than the food and mental aggravation?", "Not sure where you guys are located, but around here $400 would definitely get you at least two weeks on a cheap campground. Might not be the nicest view there but maybe be worth it to avoid any more confrontations. And you're NTA, niece is definitely old enough to read and know better. She's not \"just a hungry kid\" incapable of fixing herself anything else than a ham sandwich. And eating almost 4lbs of ham in five days is also not \"just one sandwich\". At the very least, niece could have asked you or your husband if it's okay to eat your food.", "NTA. This is my reminder to never have children!", "NTA Next time leave a chocolate laxative bar in the refrigerator.. Bet she'll learn her lesson then..", "Look, I get it. You're staying with them, you're helping out, and you expect a little respect when it comes to your husband's work food. It's not unreasonable to expect that your labeled food should be off-limits, especially when you've been contributing to the household groceries. It's about boundaries and common courtesy.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, when it comes to the niece, she's just a kid. Kids can be clueless, impulsive, and sometimes not great at following rules. It's possible that she didn't fully understand the importance of your husband's work food or the significance of the labels. So, yeah, it's a bit harsh to call her out directly without discussing it with her parents first.\r  \n\r  \nNow, let's talk about your sister-in-law's reaction. It's understandable that she might feel defensive and dismissive if she's going through her own struggles. But brushing off your concerns and getting angry doesn't help resolve the issue.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, it's a tricky situation, but I wouldn't go as far as saying you're the asshole.  It might have been more effective to approach your sister-in-law calmly and discuss the situation as a whole rather than confronting the niece directly.\r  \n\r  \nBut hey, you've got a new fridge on the way, so that's good news. \r  \n\r  \nSo, NAH, you're not a full-blown asshole, but maybe a little understanding and diplomacy could go a long way in this situation.", "NTA, \\*but\\* she doesn't have to let you park your camper and you need her, so pick your battles. Hopefully the new fridge will solve the problem.", "NTA. Leave as soon as possible.", "Nta. I was in a situation like that and it was soooo fucking annoying. I'll never put myself in that situation again. You're already spending 400 on food for them, and she ate all of his food too. Would it be cheaper just to park your camper somewhere else?", "NTA, but I\u2019m confused, why can\u2019t you just buy more ham since you\u2019re already buying them groceries? What did you buy with the $400? Did you ask them what they like to eat or decide on how much/what you would buy them?", "NTA. I wouldn't even bother arguing the point. I'd quite happily go back to renting a site at a park rather than deal with that.", "[removed]", "It\u2019s one thing if it\u2019s once or twice.", "This is a good point.", "Depends on how long they\u2019re staying with them I guess?", "I was coming to say the same thing, I'm getting crazy deja vu. OP, if you are the same person who posted last time, which I assume you are bc the details are almost the same, wouldn't it be worth it to find any other spot you could live while your concrete slabbing goes in? NTA, but the situation is clearly not tenable. I don't know what country you're in, but there are trailer parking spots on Airbnb where I live.", "This. Also what kind of foods did you purchase for them? Did you get input from them on the foods they wanted? Ultimately while I'm sure it's inconvenient for you, it was a child eating a ham sandwich, not someone maliciously getting rid of your food. And the mom will replace it. NAH", "Maybe if the child was 8, but she\u2019s 13. Come on now. A 13 year old can read and put the bread and sandwich meat back and find something else.", "Oof.  Did you even read the post?", "$400 for groceries is normal for every two weeks for a family. That\u2019s $800 a month. The campgrounds around me charge WAY less, I just think OP is getting ripped off lol", "Agreed! I thought they were getting ripped off too. Just wondered how long they\u2019re staying with them.", "My in-laws live in a camper and just travel the country (both retired). My FIL was talking me the last time they visited about some kind of deal with breweries/wineries across the country that for some small membership fee, you can stay on their land for free. The assumption is that you'll buy their alcohol if you're staying there, so they don't charge. Depending on where OP is and how long everything will take to be ready on their new land, I think it's worth looking into something like that.", "Could you deduct how much food niece ate from how much you were going to give your sister next time?", "NTA and seriously why ask you to label it if the labels clearly don\u2019t matter to them. \ud83d\ude11", "Please, OP, do this.", "Swear this is a repeat", "ESH\n\nHonestly it's not like a 13 yr old is eating all your food... If everyone eats it then just get more?!? \n\nBut it's also lame to tell your kids to ignore don't eat notes / someone's lunch. \n\nNo winners here.", "YTA. That\u2019s someone else\u2019s child. A child of the family that is doing you a big favor. What were you trying to do, get her to turn the sandwich over to you off her plate?

It wasn\u2019t your place to correct the kid in the moment.", "NTA-and yes to SIL, replace the effing food!  Neice sounds entitled and spoiled.", "Pretty disappointing SIL didn't tell niece to stop that.", "Nta why tell you to label it then???  Sounds like husband gets to make lunch food out of *their* groceries.", "INFO - Why didn't your partner speak to their sister about this instead?", "NTA, and I'd be telling your SIL, you're damn right you'll be replacing my food.\n\nCongrats on the new property!", "NTA. Get out of her driveway as soon as you can. They were both inconsiderate and aggressive, because they think there's nothing you can do about it.", "Wonder which is more expensive, $400 in food or renting a campsite. Might consider reevaluating the situation.", "NTA, just pay the weekly stays at a park. It would save you a headache.", "NTA - You aren't pissed about a child eating, you're pissed about a child STEALING.", "NTA", "> so we didn't have to spend anymore money on weekly stays.\n\nAny more, FYI. \"Anymore\" is an adverb.", "WOW.\n\nYou SIL is a bit of an a$$.  It is not a kid eating one sandwich.

And yeah, she says label it so it doesn't get eaten and then let her daughter proceed to eat it? Makes no sense.", "Kid gave zero fucks and mom has no backbone to correct her NTA", "Kinda sounds like an invitation to eat thier food, if what yours is theirs then surely theirs is yours as your family and all.", "INFO I'm just curious. You bought $400 worth of food, but you don't say over what time period.
