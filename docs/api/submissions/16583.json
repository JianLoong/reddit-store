He remarried to a woman who has a 25 year old daughter, \"Liz\". My ex and I are by no means close friends, but we've learned to keep an amicable relationship. I've met both his current wife and Liz over the years.\n\nAmy dropped out of college a few years ago because she said it wasn't for her and it was too much pressure, which I understood. Amy originally decided to take time off to travel with her friends. Both the unfinished degree and her travels were fully funded by me and my ex.  Then when she came back, she decided she didn't want to study. She now works part time as a PA.\n\nMy dad passed away in 2021 and Amy got an inheritance. A few months ago, she told me she wanted to go back to college to finish her degree, because the job market's rough. Also - she'd like me to pay for it, because it's for her future. I said I'm really happy she's deciding to go back, but I'm not going to pay more for her college. She has extra money she can use or take loans. After much debate, she said she understood.\n\nLiz was diagnosed with cancer and is now going through chemo. She had to quit her job because it was getting too much. My ex and his wife (Liz's mom) were partly contributing to her treatments. I recently found out that they've stopped, because Amy wanted them to pay for her college, so they're doing that over Liz's chemo. Now Liz is struggling to make ends meet and her fiance's working 3 jobs.\n\nI was shocked. That Liz's own mom would be doing something like this, but more so, that my own daughter could be selfish enough to take money she knows is going towards someone's cancer treatments. I told her this, but Amy said she never asked for Liz's contributions to be stopped, just for her college costs, and this is what her dad and step mom decided.\n\nI felt awful even though I know this doesn't have anything to do with me. I contacted Liz and said I'd like to contribute something to help with her treatments. It's not as much as she was getting from her parents, but it's better than nothing.\n\nShe didn't want to take it at first but I insisted, and we met over lunch to discuss everything.\n\nNow to the issue at hand - Amy found out, and she's not at all pleased because I paid for Liz but not for her college. I replied the situations are completely different and it's my choice what to do with my money, just like it's her choice to decide what to do with her inheritance.\n\nWe had a massive argument over this and now she's not talking to me, and said I was a shit mom.\n\nMy friend introduced me to this forum so I decided to make a post. I don't regret helping Liz, but now I'm thinking if I should've given some of that money to Amy.", "created_utc": 1683431189, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13abtqo/aita_for_financially_helping_my_exs_step_daughter/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why isn't Amy using her inheritance for college?. It's completely heartless for her to be pissed that you are helping someone suffering from cancer. Absolutely disgusting that her own mother stopped helping her in about of your daughter's college", "Amy can go to college now or next year or next decade.  Liz needs lifesaving treatment NOW.  NTA", "NTA \n\nYou already helped fund her travels and her unfinished degree. Those were HER choices to drop out of college and go travel. \n\nYou owe her nothing more.

Your daughter is very selfish and spoiled.", "NTA I\u2019m not sure how your ex and your daughter have such terrible priorities. Had your ex told you he was going to stop Liz\u2019s chemo payments to fund Amy\u2019s education, you might have opted to pay for Amy\u2019s college, or you might have convinced him that your 24 yo daughter can pay her own way. Regardless, when you found out what was going on, you decided to help Liz, who actually needs help. Amy needs to ditch the entitlement.", "NTA at all. Your daughter sucks though.", "NTA\nPaying for college and paying for life-saving treatments are two very different things.  It's fine for you to not want to contribute to Amy's education anymore, just as it would be fine for you to want to.  Amy is 25, and is now an independent adult.  \n\nLiz is an independent adult as well, but she's facing a life-threatening disease, one that can be defeated through treatment. You're a good soul for helping her out.  \n\nI kinda understand Amy being upset, but she's an AH for calling you a shit mom.  No, you've been a great mom already.\n\nYou're ex and his wife though, they're bad parents for prioritizing one daughter's education over the other daughter's life!", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter is okay with getting money for her education- being fair that's important- that would otherwise be going to save someone's life. \n\nBut then isn't okay with money that would not have been going to her education, being used to support the costs to save that person's life.\n\nYour daughter has some issues pretty clearly. Not wanting to do school? Fine. But she got to make that choice debt free because you and her dad had fully paid for her. Wanting to go back to school? Fantastic, she can set herself up for success as best as she is able. Being willing to take money from someone who is dying in order to not have to pay yourself? Not okay. \n\nIf she brings it up again, tell her simply, you were paying for her schooling, and then she decided to stop. Liz never decided to have cancer, but because of Amy's asking for money for schooling, she is no longer getting the support she needs. You have chosen to support someone who needs it. \n\nGenuinely I think you should talk to your ex and Liz's mom too. Because that's screwed up. Even if Amy ends up in debt later because of not getting financial support now, she can be helped with that later. After Liz is through at least this part of her health crisis.", "NTA. that's a beautiful thing you're doing.", "A resounding NTA. You & your ex supported & funded Amy\u2019s initial (though failed) education AND travel. I believe Amy is taking advantage of everyone involved in this mess. You paid her share earlier & she took trips!\n\nAmy can fund her own education through her inheritance. Your daughter wants everything handed to her. \n\nIt appears like Liz has been neglected by your ex & her own mother. You are a kind person OP. But most importantly, your money-your decision. NTA", "NTA. Cancer is not a choice. It was Amy\u2019s *choice* to drop out of college and travel with friends. Let her stay mad-she\u2019s a toddler throwing a tantrum and deserves no empathy for being completely selfish.", "NTA. You\u2019ve done your best for Amy.  Now she needs to be responsible for herself. Her Dad and stepmom are enabling her.

My dad married her mom when I was\n16)\nMy (24f) granddad left a trust for each of his grandkids.\nIt's not a massive amount, but pretty decent and I'm grateful for it. I'm planning to put it towards buying a nice car when l'm done with college. I know it's not really a\n\"necessity\", but it's something I want.\nMy step sister (25f) is currently going through chemo, which I know isn't cheap, and I do feel for her. She asked me recently if I could contribute some of my trust money to help pay for her treatments. I said sorry, but that's not possible.\nShe said she doesn't want all of it, I don't need a car right now and her payments got cut off. I said nicely, no, I do feel bad for her but I don't think I should have to give my trust money. This turned into an argument and we did kind of blow up at one another.\nI wasn't going to post but my boyfriend told me to, because he thinks what I did is a dick move, so here I am.\nAITA?", "Link to Amy\u2019s post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138pq89/aita_not_giving_my_step_sister_money_to_help_pay/", "PA?
