I am in the middle of Student Teaching and I am also in the process of finding a job for the 2023-24 school year. This week I had an interview, I had a principal observe me teach a lesson, I had a friend pass away this week. All while I\u2019m still taking college courses, so I come home to homework in the evenings. My partner (25m) is aware of all of this and he is student teaching too. But he is not interested in getting a teaching job after graduation so he is not feeling the pressure near as much as me. He is also not enrolled in any college courses. \n\nYesterday during the day, I texted him \u201cI\u2019m so hungry! I haven\u2019t ate real food in so long.\u201d \n\nHis response was \u201clet\u2019s go out to eat tonight! Or I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d \n\nI love when he cooks and I love when he takes me out. So I was excited. I had to stay after school for a couple hours yesterday to help my cooperating teacher with something, so I didn\u2019t get to my partners place until 7pm. At 7:30 pm my partner starts making French toast sticks. Right before putting it in the microwave, he asks \u201cdid you want any?\u201d \nThis Immediately pissed me off. For obvious reasons I feel like. I was hungry, and he offered to feed me actual dinner. \n\nHe noticed I was annoyed and asked why. I told him it was because I thought he was going to get me dinner. His response was \u201cthis is just a snack. I wasn\u2019t thinking about dinner\u201d. At this point, he said it wasn\u2019t too late to think of what I wanted for dinner. But I was just mad at this point. It was 7:30pm and this isn\u2019t his first time not following through on a plan.\n\nSo I just grabbed my phone to order food. I am about to finish my order when he looks at my phone and says \u201cso you\u2019re not going to get me anything or ask if I want food?\u201d At this point I was livid, all of a sudden, dinner plans were on me because he couldn\u2019t follow through with the dinner plans he offered. We basically argued until I just walked out. \n\nAITA for getting upset over these dinner plans that didn\u2019t follow through? Then trying to order my own food. Like I said, I\u2019ve had a hard week and I honestly feel like I deserve more. If my partner offers to have dinner for me, that\u2019s what I expect. Not French toast sticks at 7:30 pm on a Friday night after I haven\u2019t ate all day. His whole point is that he is exhausted from this week too. But I think that\u2019s BS.

When you are hungry and mentally exhausted you not only need to eat, you need to not have the mental labor of the decision.

Did you let your partner know what time you were going to be there? Or is it that you just expected him to be waiting and have dinner (or reservations for dinner somewhere) on hold til you arrived?", "NTA he offered to either cook or take you out and then did neither.

First off, no one here is the asshole and there's an apology warranted from both of you. \n\nThose are NOT dinner plans. There was no official confirmation or clarification. That was more of a plan for a dinner plan. Pro-tip: always clarify intentions and needs with your partner. Always. Because they are also a human who is busy, tired, and dealing with their own crap. And no matter how much \"harder\" you think you have it in the moment, you absolutely cannot use your own hardship to invalidate or belittle someone else's daily struggles. \n\nClearly your partner forgot and also failed to clarify dinner plans with you on his end. Never a good look to offer dinner or a meal and not solidify the plans and follow through. Thoughtless on their part, but I don't think his actions warranted your reaction. To me, it sounds like this was the straw that broke the camels back and your stress from the week is coming to a point.\n\nYou've explicitly said you've had a hard week, and you had certain expectations from your partner. Did you ever clearly express those expectations to them? Did you communicate at all during your hardship what you needed for support and clearly share your feelings? Because again. You can't expect your partner to just know what or how to support you, or understand the depths of what your feeling without telling them. We all like to think our partners are magically in tune with us and more often than not they aren't lol\n\nIf you ordered food without asking on purpose, that's a little petty and you did something to purposely hurt you when your partner unintentionally hurt you. This might be the one thing that makes YTA. If it was done unintentionally then you both have a lot of work to put into communication. \n\nI think both of you have valid points and feelings in this, and honestly you both need to apologize and hug. Miscommunication was a huge factor here and both of you alreacted very humanly during a stressful week. Take this as a learning opportunity to discuss your feelings and better clarify expectations in the future. You both need to be more clear about how you need to be supportive to each other. \n\nAlso please take care of your mental health. We all lose our shit from time to time, but take some time in your day to manage your stress. Yoga, meditation, a walk, video games. Whatever makes you happy..

He knew you were having a hard time, offered to get you dinner, and then by 7:30 pm clearly didn\u2019t want to actually do that so he did the bare minimum of microwaving something. When you got angry he tried to save it by saying \u201coh this isn\u2019t actually dinner\u201d but it clearly was since he didn\u2019t have another plan. That was a shitty way to behave, and if this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened, consider that you deserve someone who actually tries.", "He sounds like he has a hard time following through.", "NTA, why start heating up a snack if you're both eating soon? Why not just go straight on to ordering/making food? And if he can do this, why can't you order yourself a \"snack\" while he gets dinner ready like he was planning to do anyways?", "NTA\n\nHis exhaustion level does not mean he gets to forget his offer.   You could both be equally exhausted even though he's feeling less pressure and not taking college courses.\n\nThat's not the point.   The point is he offered to go out to eat or to make you dinner.   Not a snack, dinner.   Unless you both regularly eat dinner well after 7:30, starting the evening's food intake with a snack of French toast sticks was an asshole move.", "ESH\n\nCommunication is piss poor. Neither of you have used your words.

I'm really hungry and I need more than a snack right now, could you tell me what's the plan?\"\n\nAnd then if you get a poor response you're warranted to be frustrated. Right now I think you're affected by current events that you feel he should have mindreading skills to fulfil your needs, as sharing them feels like too much additional mental load. Obviously, that's not that fair.", "I'm a little confused...I can totally see being upset after he promised dinner and then was heating up a simple snack. But if he said it was just a snack and he'd still do dinner for you, why are you so upset? You hadn't been there long; it's not like he'd been sitting around all evening with you waiting on food. I can see wishing he'd been more prepared, but the reaction doesn't seem warranted. At the same time, I'm giving you somewhat of a pass due to your grief and stress. Just consider also giving him some grace and giving him a chance to make good on his promise.", "Is this the first time for this kind of thing or is it a pattern?  If you're both overwhelmed (and you, clearly so much moreso) but not clearly thinking because of it, I could see a lapse.  But if this is just another example of him lacking true insight to your needs, that could be another thing.", "NTA. He offered and not only didn\u2019t follow through, he put the mental load right back on you when you were wanting him to handle it.", "YTA, you are emotional and projecting your stress on him. His job isn't to be an emotional tampon and he was happy to accommodate your needs, so he was having a quick snack, he was hungry too, and looking for something to hold him over till the two of you made a decision. \n\nBy the wording of your story you are showing all types of resentment and just looking for a reason to be mad.", ">he did say that we could still figure out dinner.  \n>  \n>So I just grabbed my phone to order food.\n\nI empathize with being angry and reacting in the moment, but YTA. In between him saying the two of you could still figure out dinner and you using your phone to order only for yourself, you needed to use words and communicate, because he can't read your mind.\n\n\"I was hoping you would have been ready to head straight out to a restaurant or to start cooking when I got here. You're making yourself a snack first instead. I'm too hungry to wait. Go ahead and eat your snack. I'm going to order food for myself.\"\n\nNot asking him if he wanted to order along with you was fine. You were upset. He didn't think about your feelings and couldn't reasonably expect you to take time to think about his.", "ESH, offering to get you dinner and forgetting about it sucks, I agree. But you can't just discount his work.  He can feel exhausted too.  I think you have to communicate your expectations.  You haven't given a history or said that you were counting on him.  In truth he isn't that focused on your needs.  It doesn't make him TA, just not a good choice as partner.", "NTA\n\nMy parents were returning from a vacation last night. Guess what I had prepped for them? Club sandwiches on rye sourdough bread with onion rings.\n\nI wanted to have something for the people I love to have to eat that was simple and fulfilling. \n\nThey were very grateful!", "What is your partner bringing to your relationship? He doesn\u2019t seem supportive, he\u2019s not taking classes or looking for a job, he is coasting & just doing what he has to to get by. Is this how you want the rest of your life to go? Him doing the bare minimum while you work yourself ragged? NTA but you need an in-depth discussion to see if both of your futures are in alignment. Working a music gig once a month is a hobby not a career.", "YTA. He didn't do anything wrong. Doesn't sound like you ACTUALLY had plans for him to cook but that he suggested cooking or going out. You were rude and behaved like a petulant child.", "ESH yall seem to have made a game out of communicating the absolute bare minimum", "YTA \n\nYou totally invalidated your partners emotional state when he expressed it to you, he told you he is exhausted and you just refuse to believe that, either because him having emotions is inconvenient to your needs, or because you think that just because you had a tougher week, that he isn\u2019t allowed to feel exhausted too. \n\nYou formed an expectation from his text message that he was not aware of because you did not communicate it. Once you did communicate your expectations, he tried to meet your needs, but you refused to keep communicating and instead of discussing what to do about dinner, you chose to be dramatic and started to order food for only yourself, argued, and left hungry. \n\nIt\u2019s not his fault that you are stressed and hadn\u2019t eaten all day, but you chose to take your anger out on the first target that presented itself", "I think you seriously overreacted.

I think that\u2019s a silly question to ask from reading one Reddit post about an issue I\u2019m having with him\u2026 which isn\u2019t even a HUGE issue. \n\nI wonder what makes you assume that I don\u2019t like him.", "My comment is referring to the comment I was replying to, not your post.", "So what was he acting like when he made French toast sticks at 7:30 pm after offering me dinner around 3pm?", "She responded. He's a musician.", "Got it. \ud83d\udc4d", "I guess what I want to know is did he know what your expectation was and what time you would be home? My partner knows I do not do well hangry, but depending it could be a NAH situation.", "That would be annoying to me, I'd prefer an answer either way.\n\nCommunication doesn't seem great on your end even with just answering this questions, perhaps his side too. It's probably why you ended up frustrated and hungry.", "\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time he overlooks my needs\u201d \n\nProbably when you make comments like this", "Oh wow okay thank you. My apologies. \nI really don\u2019t want to come off like I dislike my partner.", "That he was hungry after so many hours waiting for you and wanted a snack. Doesn't sound like that was in any way an actual dinner for him unless he'd eaten all the food all day long. It'd easily be at least 45 minutes to an hour before food would be ready if cooking at home or going out. I'd need something too at that point", "I mean, he\u2019s typically the hangry one. I don\u2019t get mad often. But he knew what time I\u2019d be there. I just don\u2019t think he was considering my feelings. He was feeling snacky, so he grabbed a snack while disregarding the fact that he offered me dinner.", "What am I not answering?? \n\nHe offered two things. He didn\u2019t ask which of the two things I wanted. The plans were on him, because he offered. I\u2019m confused on what would be annoying to you.", "Yeah it\u2019s a fact. That doesn\u2019t make me not like my partner\u2026 obviously. Or I wouldn\u2019t be with him. \n\nHe just has patterns of looking over my needs.", "He knew what time I was showing up. He wasn\u2019t \u201cwaiting for me\u201d. Thank you for your insight, I just cannot understand that way of thinking because I wouldn\u2019t have done that to him.", "He had hours to make a reservation, order in, or make dinner. You know, one of the things he said he would do.", "Yeah, I woukd go NTA. Promise me food and don't deliver? NO. Would be different if he was like, \"You're early! Want a snack? Our dinner reservation is for 8:30.\" Hope your week gets better and best of luck with the job hunt!", "It's not that you're not answering, it's just I don't find your answers clear, it took a couple of comments to get an answer to what you agreed to or didn't in the end.\n\nTo me by not choosing or setting definite plans, you both just left it in the air and you got what you got. If I was in your BF's shoes, I would have pushed for an answer. If I was in your shoes, I would have given a clear answer.\n\nYou've had a hard week and you didn't eat that day, now you're putting that burden on him, I think that's unfair for people to do. So now something trivial like messed up dinner plans become a whole serious issue because of choices you made throughout the week/day.\n\nIt does sound like he was inconsiderate in the moment too though.", "Youve also said \u201che\u2019s coasting\u201d, has a pattern of \u201cbeing inconsiderate\u201d and doesn\u2019t think about your feelings. If that\u2019s honestly how you think of him why are you together doesn\u2019t exactly sound like your partner makes you happy. But your right idk your relationship I only have the information your giving out and from that it doesn\u2019t sound like you do.\n\nSo I guess a better question is why are you with someone who does this?", "I mean yeah ...he was waiting for you to show up even if he knew what time it was. You wouldn't have had a snack if hungry? That is very odd to me. He didn't do anything to you. He made a snack. And asked you if you wanted some. You seem to be ready to pick a fight because you're stressed. And yeah you retaliated by ordering food for just you so...you did even worse in my opinion.", "Thank you so much \ud83d\ude0a", "I\u2019m still confused. What answer are you looking for? I was offered dinner. I wasn\u2019t asked about what I wanted to do for dinner. The plans were not made by me.", "If I was offering to have dinner planned for someone. And I knew that they were coming at a certain time, no I would not wait to eat a hardy snack until they were present. I would maybe eat my snack before they show up\u2026\n\nI would be more thoughtful in the way I have planned for dinner. That\u2019s why I got frustrated. Because I don\u2019t understand the thought process.", "Ignore this person. They are just being annoying. Your response was very reasonable and your bf dropped the ball.", "When it\u2019s a this or that question, the answer is this or that, not yes.", "He offered to take you out or cook for you at home. Your reply was Omg, yes please!!! That's not the answer I would want. It doesn't say much to me.\n\nEverything is up in the air, no set plans, not even a time given. It doesn't say in your post if time was even discussed.\n\nI think you both could have done better.", "Thank you.", "It wasn\u2019t a question. It was an offer. Typically when he makes that offer, he makes the plans.\n\nHe didn\u2019t ask me \u201cwould you like to do this or that?\u201d\n\nHe said \u201clet\u2019s do this or that!\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. I understand what you\u2019re saying but I\u2019m telling you that\u2019s not where the miscommunication started. That was never the question in the first place.", "It wasn\u2019t a question tho! It was an offer. I guess I\u2019m just not understanding what response you would expect after offering dinner.", "So why didn't he follow up with \"what would you prefer?\""]}
