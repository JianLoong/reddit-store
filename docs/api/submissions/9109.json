I am in the middle of Student Teaching and I am also in the process of finding a job for the 2023-24 school year. This week I had an interview, I had a principal observe me teach a lesson, I had a friend pass away this week. All while I\u2019m still taking college courses, so I come home to homework in the evenings. My partner (25m) is aware of all of this and he is student teaching too. But he is not interested in getting a teaching job after graduation so he is not feeling the pressure near as much as me. He is also not enrolled in any college courses. \n\nYesterday during the day, I texted him \u201cI\u2019m so hungry! I haven\u2019t eaten real food in so long.\u201d \n\nHis response was \u201clet\u2019s go out to eat tonight! Or I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d \n\nI said \u201comg yes PLEASE!!\u201d\n\nI love when he cooks and I love when he takes me out. So I was excited. I had to stay after school for a couple hours yesterday to help my cooperating teacher with something, so I didn\u2019t get to my partners place until 7pm. At 7:30 pm my partner starts making French toast sticks. Right before putting it in the microwave, he asks \u201cdid you want any?\u201d \nThis Immediately pissed me off. For obvious reasons I feel like. I was hungry, and he offered to feed me actual dinner. \n\nHe noticed I was annoyed and asked why. I told him it was because I thought he was going to get me dinner. His response was \u201cthis is just a snack. I wasn\u2019t thinking about dinner\u201d. At this point, he said it wasn\u2019t too late to think of what I wanted for dinner. But I was just mad at this point. It was 7:30pm and this isn\u2019t his first time not following through on a plan.\n\nSo I just grabbed my phone to order food. I am about to finish my order when he looks at my phone and says \u201cso you\u2019re not going to get me anything or ask if I want food?\u201d At this point I was livid, all of a sudden, dinner plans were on me because he couldn\u2019t follow through with the dinner plans he offered. We basically argued until I just walked out. \n\nAITA for getting upset over these dinner plans that didn\u2019t follow through? Then trying to order my own food. Like I said, I\u2019ve had a hard week and I honestly feel like I deserve more. If my partner offers to have dinner for me, that\u2019s what I expect. Not French toast sticks at 7:30 pm on a Friday night after I haven\u2019t eaten all day. His whole point is that he is exhausted from this week too. But I think that\u2019s BS.

When you are hungry and mentally exhausted you not only need to eat, you need to not have the mental labor of the decision.

First off, no one here is the asshole and there's an apology warranted from both of you. \n\nThose are NOT dinner plans. There was no official confirmation or clarification. That was more of a plan for a dinner plan. Pro-tip: always clarify intentions and needs with your partner. Always. Because they are also a human who is busy, tired, and dealing with their own crap. And no matter how much \"harder\" you think you have it in the moment, you absolutely cannot use your own hardship to invalidate or belittle someone else's daily struggles. \n\nClearly your partner forgot and also failed to clarify dinner plans with you on his end. Never a good look to offer dinner or a meal and not solidify the plans and follow through. Thoughtless on their part, but I don't think his actions warranted your reaction. To me, it sounds like this was the straw that broke the camels back and your stress from the week is coming to a point.\n\nYou've explicitly said you've had a hard week, and you had certain expectations from your partner. Did you ever clearly express those expectations to them? Did you communicate at all during your hardship what you needed for support and clearly share your feelings? Because again. You can't expect your partner to just know what or how to support you, or understand the depths of what your feeling without telling them. We all like to think our partners are magically in tune with us and more often than not they aren't lol\n\nIf you ordered food without asking on purpose, that's a little petty and you did something to purposely hurt you when your partner unintentionally hurt you. This might be the one thing that makes YTA. If it was done unintentionally then you both have a lot of work to put into communication. \n\nI think both of you have valid points and feelings in this, and honestly you both need to apologize and hug. Miscommunication was a huge factor here and both of you alreacted very humanly during a stressful week. Take this as a learning opportunity to discuss your feelings and better clarify expectations in the future. You both need to be more clear about how you need to be supportive to each other. \n\nAlso please take care of your mental health. We all lose our shit from time to time, but take some time in your day to manage your stress. Yoga, meditation, a walk, video games. Whatever makes you happy..

He knew you were having a hard time, offered to get you dinner, and then by 7:30 pm clearly didn\u2019t want to actually do that so he did the bare minimum of microwaving something. When you got angry he tried to save it by saying \u201coh this isn\u2019t actually dinner\u201d but it clearly was since he didn\u2019t have another plan. That was a shitty way to behave, and if this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened, consider that you deserve someone who actually tries.", "He sounds like he has a hard time following through.", "NTA, why start heating up a snack if you're both eating soon? Why not just go straight on to ordering/making food? And if he can do this, why can't you order yourself a \"snack\" while he gets dinner ready like he was planning to do anyways?", "NTA\n\nHis exhaustion level does not mean he gets to forget his offer.   You could both be equally exhausted even though he's feeling less pressure and not taking college courses.\n\nThat's not the point.   The point is he offered to go out to eat or to make you dinner.   Not a snack, dinner.   Unless you both regularly eat dinner well after 7:30, starting the evening's food intake with a snack of French toast sticks was an asshole move.", "ESH\n\nCommunication is piss poor. Neither of you have used your words.

I'm really hungry and I need more than a snack right now, could you tell me what's the plan?\"\n\nAnd then if you get a poor response you're warranted to be frustrated. Right now I think you're affected by current events that you feel he should have mindreading skills to fulfil your needs, as sharing them feels like too much additional mental load. Obviously, that's not that fair.", "I'm a little confused...I can totally see being upset after he promised dinner and then was heating up a simple snack. But if he said it was just a snack and he'd still do dinner for you, why are you so upset? You hadn't been there long; it's not like he'd been sitting around all evening with you waiting on food. I can see wishing he'd been more prepared, but the reaction doesn't seem warranted. At the same time, I'm giving you somewhat of a pass due to your grief and stress. Just consider also giving him some grace and giving him a chance to make good on his promise.", "Is this the first time for this kind of thing or is it a pattern?  If you're both overwhelmed (and you, clearly so much moreso) but not clearly thinking because of it, I could see a lapse.  But if this is just another example of him lacking true insight to your needs, that could be another thing.", "NTA. He offered and not only didn\u2019t follow through, he put the mental load right back on you when you were wanting him to handle it.", "YTA, you are emotional and projecting your stress on him. His job isn't to be an emotional tampon and he was happy to accommodate your needs, so he was having a quick snack, he was hungry too, and looking for something to hold him over till the two of you made a decision. \n\nBy the wording of your story you are showing all types of resentment and just looking for a reason to be mad.", ">he did say that we could still figure out dinner.  \n>  \n>So I just grabbed my phone to order food.\n\nI empathize with being angry and reacting in the moment, but YTA. In between him saying the two of you could still figure out dinner and you using your phone to order only for yourself, you needed to use words and communicate, because he can't read your mind.\n\n\"I was hoping you would have been ready to head straight out to a restaurant or to start cooking when I got here. You're making yourself a snack first instead. I'm too hungry to wait. Go ahead and eat your snack. I'm going to order food for myself.\"\n\nNot asking him if he wanted to order along with you was fine. You were upset. He didn't think about your feelings and couldn't reasonably expect you to take time to think about his.", "ESH, offering to get you dinner and forgetting about it sucks, I agree. But you can't just discount his work.  He can feel exhausted too.  I think you have to communicate your expectations.  You haven't given a history or said that you were counting on him.  In truth he isn't that focused on your needs.  It doesn't make him TA, just not a good choice as partner.", "NTA\n\nMy parents were returning from a vacation last night. Guess what I had prepped for them?

He doesn\u2019t seem supportive, he\u2019s not taking classes or looking for a job, he is coasting & just doing what he has to to get by. Is this how you want the rest of your life to go? Him doing the bare minimum while you work yourself ragged? NTA but you need an in-depth discussion to see if both of your futures are in alignment.

You were rude and behaved like a petulant child.", "ESH yall seem to have made a game out of communicating the absolute bare minimum", "YTA \n\nYou totally invalidated your partners emotional state when he expressed it to you, he told you he is exhausted and you just refuse to believe that, either because him having emotions is inconvenient to your needs, or because you think that just because you had a tougher week, that he isn\u2019t allowed to feel exhausted too. \n\nYou formed an expectation from his text message that he was not aware of because you did not communicate it. Once you did communicate your expectations, he tried to meet your needs, but you refused to keep communicating and instead of discussing what to do about dinner, you chose to be dramatic and started to order food for only yourself, argued, and left hungry. \n\nIt\u2019s not his fault that you are stressed and hadn\u2019t eaten all day, but you chose to take your anger out on the first target that presented itself", "I think you seriously overreacted.

Or I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d\n\nWhat he did not say was \"I will make the decision and let you know.\" What I think he meant here was 'let me know which of these you'd prefer, potentially with more specifics like what type of food you do/don't want.\n\n>I said \u201comg yes PLEASE!!\u201d\n\nWhat you did not say was \"I'd prefer X and I'd like to eat by Z. Please plan accordingly.\"\n\nThis all seems painfully obvious, but I and my husband have gotten frustrated with each other over things we *think* are painfully obvious, but were not for one reason or another. After a decade this still happens from time to time, but we've learned to be *very* direct with each other, especially if it's a situation where a misinterpretation is going to have shitty results. He really should've been more considerate of your struggles, but you can sit down and talk through how these things can be better communicated in the future. And if he wants to make up for it - because he did hurt you even if unintentionally - he is welcome to cook you a full dinner tomorrow!", "NTA. I know what you\u2019re going through. Yes, you have some work to do on your communication skills (me too! You\u2019re not alone) BUT your partner also needs to be responsive to your needs and this isn\u2019t something that should have to be spelled out for him. Hang in there, teacher :)", "You're both assholes.    You don't deserve jack from him because his life is slightly less stressful than yours atm. And it certainly doesn't excuse you taking your frustrations out on him.   He's the asshole for making a promise he didn't keep.", "NTA", "NTA. I am so sorry to hear you lost your friend. Please be gentle with yourself & the myriad of feelings that come with grief. \n\nBig NTA love. My sister has been with her partner, a dude, for about 8 years now. He does not regularly cook dinner as the main cook (doing most of the work). They have been fighting about this for FOUR YEARS. He cannot just cook 2 nights a week completely unassisted (selecting a recipe, checking for ingredients at home before going to the grocery store). He has ADHD & just cannot get it. I do too. Just left my ex partner after 4 years because of similar issues. \n\nYou had an incredibly intense week academically & professionally as well as socially. All these worlds mix together. We carry them with us. You NTA at all.", "Thank you for responding, You put a lot of effort into telling us what he doesn't do as it compares to what you are involved with. Might just be me but you gave off a vibe of frustration like he isn't doing what you want him to do with his life. The only positives you gave were those when he served your needs. You loved it when he cooks for you or takes you to dinner. That's all well and good, we all like being treated nicely. But by your own words, you left the convo with him that he would cook or take you out, you never decided on one or the other. You are mad he just didn't take the initiative and that's fine, I am sure you were tired and hungry but you overreacted. As I said it just felt like you were looking for a fight, you didn't arrive happy and left feeling justified, or did you? you came here looking for validation, how many men sided with you? I know most if not all women did. Do you only want to hear from your sister?", "Which is dumb. The lie made it worse. The truth would have been fine. \"Omg, I'm so sorry, I forgot! Things have been crazy.. Let me grab my shoes and we'll go.\"", "Forgetting isn't that awful as long as he immediately apologized and made it right. Doubling down on it is the real problem, and then getting upset she didn't provide him food, too...", "This! If he can\u2019t be supportive under your current circumstances I wouldn\u2019t count on him to suddenly learn how to do it. Sounds like he\u2019s lacking in emotional maturity and he is the AT for trying to turn this around on you. I wasted so much time in a similar sounding relationship at your age, and I really wish I would\u2019ve taken moments like this as opportunities to get out and move on.", "Can he pay his bills, and support a family with the income he makes from his music \u201cside gigs?\u201d If not, that\u2019s not a job. It\u2019s a hobby and he\u2019ll need a sugar mommy to support his needs, wants, and ahem\u2026..career.", "So what kind of music gigs is he getting now? Why isn't he working on Friday night?\n\nMusician is a 24/7 job if you want success. He sounds more like a slacker wannabe.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this made me depressed and it's not even my man", "Because it\u2019s a poorly paying *hobby* until you hit the big leagues, or have parents buy millions of records of your debut album (looking at you, Taylor Swift).", "Ok, but what you listed were actual jobs you can do as a musician. I guess I don\u2019t know for sure, but it doesn\u2019t sound like boyfriend is out there hustling and teaching guitar to students - sounds more like he\u2019s just hoping to hit it big. What you described your family doing is admirable and can actually pay the bills. Not sure whatever boyfriend is doing will.", "OMG! I am in engineering and so many of my colleagues are musicians, dancers or artists on the side. They didn't jump into their passions from the get go. Few of them have now build a career in music now but they first had a well paying regular job and hustled with their passions.", "NTA Weaponized incompetence", "NTA \n\nGirl, my girl has had way less stressful days and it is an absolute pleasure to feed her when I know she's coming by, whether it be cooking or ordering pickup. It's not complicated. And the fact that he got pissy in the moment is so annoying. Like, he wasn't even making those frozen ass French toast sticks to share so why is he mad at you trying to order your own food? \n\nLiterally: making pasta and garlic bread isn't hard. Baking chicken isn't hard. A casserole? A frozen fucking pizza + salad? \n\nHe's not even trying. \n\nI'd say communicate expectations for this scenario moving forward. See how it goes. Let him know having that promise unfulfilled sucks. And if it continues? DTMFA", "I would just like to say that as a man when I say something to the effect of \u201cwe could go out\u201d or \u201cI could make something\u201d after someone talks about being hungry it not me saying \u201cI\u2019m going to take take you to your favorite restaurant\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to make you your favorite meal\u201d I\u2019m asking you \u201cif you want to go out?\u201d if yes where do you want to go and \u201cI could cook for you\u201d if yes what do you want. It\u2019s sounds like he was waiting for you to decide what you wanted him to do and once you started to order something on your phone he probably assumed you didn\u2019t want to go out or have him cook for you. Just a possibility.", "This! Ugh. They both suck at communicating. OP thinks her BF can magically read her mind. BF sucks at following up. Besides, how does OP know BF also didn't have a difficult week? Why are they even in a relationship when they can't communicate properly?\n\nPlus reading OP's replies, I find it so unhealthy to be keeping score of who does what (particularly how many times she vs him have been in charge of dinner).\n\n\"Yes please\" is never a proper reply when the other person is giving you options. The proper reply is either make a choice or say the decision is up to rhe other person. You both need a lot of growing up to do.", "I was angry for you! Eating pizza haha my partner comes back and I ask if he wants anything. We talk.", "Please tell him that there is no music industry anymore. I have a Grammy-nominated friend who can\u2019t make ends meet. Signed, a former music industry employee.", "oh of course it's always the guy's fault when the chick is Hangry, he would have been equally wrong if he chose the wrong place or made the wrong dish, every word of this story was an angry woman pining for a fight, she has a whole herd of women taking her side too.", "This is fair. GnR, Motley Crue, Aerosmith, The Stones - all of them had girlfriends helping them out in the beginning."]}
