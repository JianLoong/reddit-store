I am in the middle of Student Teaching and I am also in the process of finding a job for the 2023-24 school year. This week I had an interview, I had a principal observe me teach a lesson, I had a friend pass away this week. All while I\u2019m still taking college courses, so I come home to homework in the evenings. My partner (25m) is aware of all of this and he is student teaching too. But he is not interested in getting a teaching job after graduation so he is not feeling the pressure near as much as me. He is also not enrolled in any college courses. \n\nYesterday during the day, I texted him \u201cI\u2019m so hungry! I haven\u2019t ate real food in so long.\u201d \n\nHis response was \u201clet\u2019s go out to eat tonight! Or I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d \n\nI love when he cooks and I love when he takes me out. So I was excited. I had to stay after school for a couple hours yesterday to help my cooperating teacher with something, so I didn\u2019t get to my partners place until 7pm. At 7:30 pm my partner starts making French toast sticks. Right before putting it in the microwave, he asks \u201cdid you want any?\u201d \nThis Immediately pissed me off. For obvious reasons I feel like. I was hungry, and he offered to feed me actual dinner. \n\nHe noticed I was annoyed and asked why. I told him it was because I thought he was going to get me dinner. His response was \u201cthis is just a snack. I wasn\u2019t thinking about dinner\u201d. At this point, he said it wasn\u2019t too late to think of what I wanted for dinner. But I was just mad at this point. It was 7:30pm and this isn\u2019t his first time not following through on a plan.\n\nSo I just grabbed my phone to order food. I am about to finish my order when he looks at my phone and says \u201cso you\u2019re not going to get me anything or ask if I want food?\u201d At this point I was livid, all of a sudden, dinner plans were on me because he couldn\u2019t follow through with the dinner plans he offered. We basically argued until I just walked out. \n\nAITA for getting upset over these dinner plans that didn\u2019t follow through? Then trying to order my own food. Like I said, I\u2019ve had a hard week and I honestly feel like I deserve more. If my partner offers to have dinner for me, that\u2019s what I expect. Not French toast sticks at 7:30 pm on a Friday night after I haven\u2019t ate all day. His whole point is that he is exhausted from this week too. But I think that\u2019s BS.

When you are hungry and mentally exhausted you not only need to eat, you need to not have the mental labor of the decision.

First off, no one here is the asshole and there's an apology warranted from both of you. \n\nThose are NOT dinner plans. There was no official confirmation or clarification. That was more of a plan for a dinner plan. Pro-tip: always clarify intentions and needs with your partner. Always. Because they are also a human who is busy, tired, and dealing with their own crap. And no matter how much \"harder\" you think you have it in the moment, you absolutely cannot use your own hardship to invalidate or belittle someone else's daily struggles. \n\nClearly your partner forgot and also failed to clarify dinner plans with you on his end. Never a good look to offer dinner or a meal and not solidify the plans and follow through. Thoughtless on their part, but I don't think his actions warranted your reaction. To me, it sounds like this was the straw that broke the camels back and your stress from the week is coming to a point.\n\nYou've explicitly said you've had a hard week, and you had certain expectations from your partner. Did you ever clearly express those expectations to them? Did you communicate at all during your hardship what you needed for support and clearly share your feelings? Because again. You can't expect your partner to just know what or how to support you, or understand the depths of what your feeling without telling them. We all like to think our partners are magically in tune with us and more often than not they aren't lol\n\nIf you ordered food without asking on purpose, that's a little petty and you did something to purposely hurt you when your partner unintentionally hurt you. This might be the one thing that makes YTA. If it was done unintentionally then you both have a lot of work to put into communication. \n\nI think both of you have valid points and feelings in this, and honestly you both need to apologize and hug. Miscommunication was a huge factor here and both of you alreacted very humanly during a stressful week. Take this as a learning opportunity to discuss your feelings and better clarify expectations in the future. You both need to be more clear about how you need to be supportive to each other. \n\nAlso please take care of your mental health. We all lose our shit from time to time, but take some time in your day to manage your stress. Yoga, meditation, a walk, video games. Whatever makes you happy..

He knew you were having a hard time, offered to get you dinner, and then by 7:30 pm clearly didn\u2019t want to actually do that so he did the bare minimum of microwaving something. When you got angry he tried to save it by saying \u201coh this isn\u2019t actually dinner\u201d but it clearly was since he didn\u2019t have another plan. That was a shitty way to behave, and if this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened, consider that you deserve someone who actually tries.", "He sounds like he has a hard time following through.", "NTA, why start heating up a snack if you're both eating soon? Why not just go straight on to ordering/making food? And if he can do this, why can't you order yourself a \"snack\" while he gets dinner ready like he was planning to do anyways?", "NTA\n\nHis exhaustion level does not mean he gets to forget his offer.   You could both be equally exhausted even though he's feeling less pressure and not taking college courses.\n\nThat's not the point.   The point is he offered to go out to eat or to make you dinner.   Not a snack, dinner.   Unless you both regularly eat dinner well after 7:30, starting the evening's food intake with a snack of French toast sticks was an asshole move.", "ESH\n\nCommunication is piss poor. Neither of you have used your words.

I'm really hungry and I need more than a snack right now, could you tell me what's the plan?\"\n\nAnd then if you get a poor response you're warranted to be frustrated. Right now I think you're affected by current events that you feel he should have mindreading skills to fulfil your needs, as sharing them feels like too much additional mental load. Obviously, that's not that fair.", "I'm a little confused...I can totally see being upset after he promised dinner and then was heating up a simple snack. But if he said it was just a snack and he'd still do dinner for you, why are you so upset? You hadn't been there long; it's not like he'd been sitting around all evening with you waiting on food. I can see wishing he'd been more prepared, but the reaction doesn't seem warranted. At the same time, I'm giving you somewhat of a pass due to your grief and stress. Just consider also giving him some grace and giving him a chance to make good on his promise.", "Is this the first time for this kind of thing or is it a pattern?  If you're both overwhelmed (and you, clearly so much moreso) but not clearly thinking because of it, I could see a lapse.  But if this is just another example of him lacking true insight to your needs, that could be another thing.", "NTA. He offered and not only didn\u2019t follow through, he put the mental load right back on you when you were wanting him to handle it.", "YTA, you are emotional and projecting your stress on him. His job isn't to be an emotional tampon and he was happy to accommodate your needs, so he was having a quick snack, he was hungry too, and looking for something to hold him over till the two of you made a decision. \n\nBy the wording of your story you are showing all types of resentment and just looking for a reason to be mad.", ">he did say that we could still figure out dinner.  \n>  \n>So I just grabbed my phone to order food.\n\nI empathize with being angry and reacting in the moment, but YTA. In between him saying the two of you could still figure out dinner and you using your phone to order only for yourself, you needed to use words and communicate, because he can't read your mind.\n\n\"I was hoping you would have been ready to head straight out to a restaurant or to start cooking when I got here. You're making yourself a snack first instead. I'm too hungry to wait. Go ahead and eat your snack. I'm going to order food for myself.\"\n\nNot asking him if he wanted to order along with you was fine. You were upset. He didn't think about your feelings and couldn't reasonably expect you to take time to think about his.", "ESH, offering to get you dinner and forgetting about it sucks, I agree. But you can't just discount his work.  He can feel exhausted too.  I think you have to communicate your expectations.  You haven't given a history or said that you were counting on him.  In truth he isn't that focused on your needs.  It doesn't make him TA, just not a good choice as partner.", "NTA\n\nMy parents were returning from a vacation last night.

He doesn\u2019t seem supportive, he\u2019s not taking classes or looking for a job, he is coasting & just doing what he has to to get by. Is this how you want the rest of your life to go? Him doing the bare minimum while you work yourself ragged? NTA but you need an in-depth discussion to see if both of your futures are in alignment.

You were rude and behaved like a petulant child.", "ESH yall seem to have made a game out of communicating the absolute bare minimum", "YTA \n\nYou totally invalidated your partners emotional state when he expressed it to you, he told you he is exhausted and you just refuse to believe that, either because him having emotions is inconvenient to your needs, or because you think that just because you had a tougher week, that he isn\u2019t allowed to feel exhausted too. \n\nYou formed an expectation from his text message that he was not aware of because you did not communicate it. Once you did communicate your expectations, he tried to meet your needs, but you refused to keep communicating and instead of discussing what to do about dinner, you chose to be dramatic and started to order food for only yourself, argued, and left hungry. \n\nIt\u2019s not his fault that you are stressed and hadn\u2019t eaten all day, but you chose to take your anger out on the first target that presented itself", "I think you seriously overreacted.
