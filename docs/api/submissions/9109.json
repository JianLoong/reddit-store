I am in the middle of Student Teaching and I am also in the process of finding a job for the 2023-24 school year. This week I had an interview, I had a principal observe me teach a lesson, I had a friend pass away this week. All while I\u2019m still taking college courses, so I come home to homework in the evenings. My partner (25m) is aware of all of this and he is student teaching too. But he is not interested in getting a teaching job after graduation so he is not feeling the pressure near as much as me. He is also not enrolled in any college courses. \n\nYesterday during the day, I texted him \u201cI\u2019m so hungry! I haven\u2019t eaten real food in so long.\u201d \n\nHis response was \u201clet\u2019s go out to eat tonight! Or I\u2019ll make dinner.\u201d \n\nI said \u201comg yes PLEASE!!\u201d\n\nI love when he cooks and I love when he takes me out. So I was excited. I had to stay after school for a couple hours yesterday to help my cooperating teacher with something, so I didn\u2019t get to my partners place until 7pm. At 7:30 pm my partner starts making French toast sticks. Right before putting it in the microwave, he asks \u201cdid you want any?\u201d \nThis Immediately pissed me off. For obvious reasons I feel like. I was hungry, and he offered to feed me actual dinner. \n\nHe noticed I was annoyed and asked why. I told him it was because I thought he was going to get me dinner. His response was \u201cthis is just a snack. I wasn\u2019t thinking about dinner\u201d. At this point, he said it wasn\u2019t too late to think of what I wanted for dinner. But I was just mad at this point. It was 7:30pm and this isn\u2019t his first time not following through on a plan.\n\nSo I just grabbed my phone to order food. I am about to finish my order when he looks at my phone and says \u201cso you\u2019re not going to get me anything or ask if I want food?\u201d At this point I was livid, all of a sudden, dinner plans were on me because he couldn\u2019t follow through with the dinner plans he offered. We basically argued until I just walked out. \n\nAITA for getting upset over these dinner plans that didn\u2019t follow through? Then trying to order my own food. Like I said, I\u2019ve had a hard week and I honestly feel like I deserve more. If my partner offers to have dinner for me, that\u2019s what I expect. Not French toast sticks at 7:30 pm on a Friday night after I haven\u2019t eaten all day. His whole point is that he is exhausted from this week too. But I think that\u2019s BS.

When you are hungry and mentally exhausted you not only need to eat, you need to not have the mental labor of the decision.

First off, no one here is the asshole and there's an apology warranted from both of you. \n\nThose are NOT dinner plans. There was no official confirmation or clarification. That was more of a plan for a dinner plan. Pro-tip: always clarify intentions and needs with your partner. Always. Because they are also a human who is busy, tired, and dealing with their own crap. And no matter how much \"harder\" you think you have it in the moment, you absolutely cannot use your own hardship to invalidate or belittle someone else's daily struggles. \n\nClearly your partner forgot and also failed to clarify dinner plans with you on his end. Never a good look to offer dinner or a meal and not solidify the plans and follow through. Thoughtless on their part, but I don't think his actions warranted your reaction. To me, it sounds like this was the straw that broke the camels back and your stress from the week is coming to a point.\n\nYou've explicitly said you've had a hard week, and you had certain expectations from your partner. Did you ever clearly express those expectations to them? Did you communicate at all during your hardship what you needed for support and clearly share your feelings? Because again. You can't expect your partner to just know what or how to support you, or understand the depths of what your feeling without telling them. We all like to think our partners are magically in tune with us and more often than not they aren't lol\n\nIf you ordered food without asking on purpose, that's a little petty and you did something to purposely hurt you when your partner unintentionally hurt you. This might be the one thing that makes YTA. If it was done unintentionally then you both have a lot of work to put into communication. \n\nI think both of you have valid points and feelings in this, and honestly you both need to apologize and hug. Miscommunication was a huge factor here and both of you alreacted very humanly during a stressful week. Take this as a learning opportunity to discuss your feelings and better clarify expectations in the future. You both need to be more clear about how you need to be supportive to each other. \n\nAlso please take care of your mental health. We all lose our shit from time to time, but take some time in your day to manage your stress. Yoga, meditation, a walk, video games. Whatever makes you happy..

He knew you were having a hard time, offered to get you dinner, and then by 7:30 pm clearly didn\u2019t want to actually do that so he did the bare minimum of microwaving something. When you got angry he tried to save it by saying \u201coh this isn\u2019t actually dinner\u201d but it clearly was since he didn\u2019t have another plan. That was a shitty way to behave, and if this isn\u2019t the first time this has happened, consider that you deserve someone who actually tries.", "He sounds like he has a hard time following through.", "NTA, why start heating up a snack if you're both eating soon? Why not just go straight on to ordering/making food? And if he can do this, why can't you order yourself a \"snack\" while he gets dinner ready like he was planning to do anyways?", "NTA\n\nHis exhaustion level does not mean he gets to forget his offer.   You could both be equally exhausted even though he's feeling less pressure and not taking college courses.\n\nThat's not the point.   The point is he offered to go out to eat or to make you dinner.   Not a snack, dinner.   Unless you both regularly eat dinner well after 7:30, starting the evening's food intake with a snack of French toast sticks was an asshole move.", "ESH\n\nCommunication is piss poor.

I'm really hungry and I need more than a snack right now, could you tell me what's the plan?\"\n\nAnd then if you get a poor response you're warranted to be frustrated. Right now I think you're affected by current events that you feel he should have mindreading skills to fulfil your needs, as sharing them feels like too much additional mental load. Obviously, that's not that fair.", "I'm a little confused...I can totally see being upset after he promised dinner and then was heating up a simple snack. But if he said it was just a snack and he'd still do dinner for you, why are you so upset? You hadn't been there long; it's not like he'd been sitting around all evening with you waiting on food. I can see wishing he'd been more prepared, but the reaction doesn't seem warranted. At the same time, I'm giving you somewhat of a pass due to your grief and stress. Just consider also giving him some grace and giving him a chance to make good on his promise.", "Is this the first time for this kind of thing or is it a pattern?  If you're both overwhelmed (and you, clearly so much moreso) but not clearly thinking because of it, I could see a lapse.  But if this is just another example of him lacking true insight to your needs, that could be another thing.", "NTA. He offered and not only didn\u2019t follow through, he put the mental load right back on you when you were wanting him to handle it.", "YTA, you are emotional and projecting your stress on him. His job isn't to be an emotional tampon and he was happy to accommodate your needs, so he was having a quick snack, he was hungry too, and looking for something to hold him over till the two of you made a decision. \n\nBy the wording of your story you are showing all types of resentment and just looking for a reason to be mad.", ">he did say that we could still figure out dinner.  \n>  \n>So I just grabbed my phone to order food.\n\nI empathize with being angry and reacting in the moment, but YTA. In between him saying the two of you could still figure out dinner and you using your phone to order only for yourself, you needed to use words and communicate, because he can't read your mind.\n\n\"I was hoping you would have been ready to head straight out to a restaurant or to start cooking when I got here. You're making yourself a snack first instead. I'm too hungry to wait. Go ahead and eat your snack. I'm going to order food for myself.\"\n\nNot asking him if he wanted to order along with you was fine. You were upset. He didn't think about your feelings and couldn't reasonably expect you to take time to think about his.", "ESH, offering to get you dinner and forgetting about it sucks, I agree. But you can't just discount his work.  He can feel exhausted too.  I think you have to communicate your expectations.  You haven't given a history or said that you were counting on him.  In truth he isn't that focused on your needs.  It doesn't make him TA, just not a good choice as partner.", "NTA\n\nMy parents were returning from a vacation last night.

He doesn\u2019t seem supportive, he\u2019s not taking classes or looking for a job, he is coasting & just doing what he has to to get by. Is this how you want the rest of your life to go? Him doing the bare minimum while you work yourself ragged? NTA but you need an in-depth discussion to see if both of your futures are in alignment.

You were rude and behaved like a petulant child.", "ESH yall seem to have made a game out of communicating the absolute bare minimum", "YTA \n\nYou totally invalidated your partners emotional state when he expressed it to you, he told you he is exhausted and you just refuse to believe that, either because him having emotions is inconvenient to your needs, or because you think that just because you had a tougher week, that he isn\u2019t allowed to feel exhausted too. \n\nYou formed an expectation from his text message that he was not aware of because you did not communicate it. Once you did communicate your expectations, he tried to meet your needs, but you refused to keep communicating and instead of discussing what to do about dinner, you chose to be dramatic and started to order food for only yourself, argued, and left hungry. \n\nIt\u2019s not his fault that you are stressed and hadn\u2019t eaten all day, but you chose to take your anger out on the first target that presented itself", "I think you seriously overreacted.

You deserve better", "NTA \nBut he is a red flag, he is not taking notice of your emotions and needs. \nHow long has that been going on? \nYour partner is supposed to be helping you and supporting you in you moments of stress, it seems like even after directly telling him, he \u201cforgets\u201d and then FLIPS the matter to you and gets pissy. \nI would start paying attention to all his behaviors, and thinking if you want to continue with that amount of either carelessness or selfishness.", "Oh dear, it sounds like you\u2019re going to be doing all the heavy lifting in this relationship. If you\u2019re OK with that, then great, but if you already sounds like you\u2019re exhausted and stressed.", "NTA. Your partner was too lazy to make good on his word. See how he likes 3 or 4 months without your favors.", "NTA, and also, OMG. You can do better than this guy.", "NTA, this guy sucks and doesn't have basic compassion for his partner. You deserve better.", "He is showing you that his problems will always be at least as bad as yours (whether or not that\u2019s true). And he is showing you that you can\u2019t count on him to keep his word. Now you have a choice to accept him as he is or not. He won\u2019t change because you want him to. If he ver changes it will be because he wants to and you can\u2019t make him want to. NTA", "You\u2019re really gonna pay for this man to reach his dreams when he can\u2019t even make a single meal for you.", "NTA. I would reconsider this relationship. He won't change and he's already very comfortable blaming you for expecting him to do what he says.", "NTA\n\nThis is casually thoughtless. Did he forget he'd made the offer? Does he often make offers or plans he doesn't follow through with? You might be with the wrong person for you.", "Esh\n\nI\u2019d have reminded him that morning about his offer and let him know i was counting on it. If after that reminder he flaked - yeah i\u2019d flip out too. But texting is hard way to make plans for sure. You need to verify.\n\nHe flaked. Then he wanted food from you. He didn\u2019t read the room and realize how pissed you were that he flaked. He was by far the bigger jerk.", "NTA your partner is a joke! Who does that or treats people that way? You can do way better, if he really cared he would\u2019ve been a supportive partner and he wasn\u2019t, also who snacks at 7:30pm instead of getting dinner, your bf is the AH in this whole situation not to mention he didn\u2019t mean what he said obviously and it kind of looks like he\u2019s playing games at this point", "NTA. Offering to do something nice and then not doing it is worse than not offering at all. He set an expectation, then got mad at you for believing him. Sounds exhausting.", "Yes you are, very self centred without any consideration for how he may have had an equally hard week. Ask yourself this, Are you blowing up a relationship over something so simple as dinner \u2026. Yes \u2026\u2026 ass hole move", "NTA but also if that is 'the hardest week of your life' ooooo you are definitely going to need to toughen up.  Especially if you're going into teaching.", "Yeah you sound exhausted and hungry and had expressed that beforehand. \n\nWalking out before you say something you really regret is a good idea. Him asking you passive aggressively if you\u2019re not going to sort out food for him is what puts you NTA and him TA when he had offered to organise food prior.", "This! The absolute audacity breaking point.", "I came here to say this ^", "Yeah nah.", "Completely agree, not only does this whole situation seem like a massive overreaction by op, they are so inconsiderate when expecting their partner to be a considerate mind reader. \n\nOp needs to learn how to actually communicate instead of dropping hints, and give the same amount of effort and care she expects to get back. The partner probably didn\u2019t comprehend the one comment that \n\nshe said: \u201cI\u2019m so hungry! I haven\u2019t eaten real food in so long\u201d \n\nwhen she actually meant: \u201cI need to have a meal soon, I am not feeling well. Can you plan something for dinner because I am pretty overwhelmed with everything right now\u201d \n\nYet she expects this guy to be a genius who can decipher that from that much information. \n\nThe ordering her dinner and intentionally excluding him because he didn\u2019t get that? And why is that acceptable? Because she\u2019s hungry? That means you can act however you want regardless of how inconsiderate it might be right?", "Proper communication is especially important when going through a stressful time. Not having the patience to let him explain his plans that you assumed ended with just the microwaved French toast sticks was shitty. Going through stress or difficult times is not an excuse to pass that onto someone else.", "I hope you are not combining finances with this ~~person~~ future mooch.", "He will never use the back up plan because he has you his cash cow. He wants to be in the music industry and have you bank roll him when it doesn\u2019t work out. NTA", "Sounds like you might want to look for another partner... just as a back up plan", "Yeah, I think especially if OP is often left in charge of cooking or food plans I don't blame her for being annoyed. She did say that she was overwhelmed and hungry and he did make it sound like he was going to cook or plan something. But I think there were simple ways to salvage this before it exploded. Like as soon as she got home she could have said, \"I'm so hungry. Were you going to cook or are we going out?\" And then if he said, \"oh, I don't know, what do you want?\" she could have said, \"I don't have the energy to decide, could you please pick a restaurant? I really want real food and it doesn't look like you've started dinner.\"\n\nETA: It feels a bit like she had a standard he wasn't totally aware of (even if he should have been) and instead of clarifying when it was clear he wasn't immediately on top of dinner she just waited to see if he would succeed or fail.", "Oh no, now she has to decide how he provides food?!", "Eh, I don't think it's a given that she would pick one (and if she responded at all he would have known that she hadn't picked one and could have clarified or taken the initiative.) \n\nBut when she got there and it was clear he didn't have anything in progress/wasn't telling her the plan, she could have asked what was going on and made it clear she was invested in his earlier suggestions. Sounds like she just waited around until he didn't meet her unspoken expectations and then blew up over it.", "I feel like he forgot\u2026 which makes him TA.", "Oh, he 100% forgot when he put those French toast sticks in the microwave that he ever promised you dinner. He was just trying to cover his ass with the \"it's a snack\" thing.", "you should honestly edit this into your post. it sounds as though the conversation stopped / topic changed after he said we can go out or he can make something. then it could be pretty 50/50 whether him suggesting it actually meant he should cook/make plans.\n\nthe fact that you confirmed you wanted one of those two options makes it NTA. microwave food at 7:30 could maybe be a snack before going out to eat at like 9, but it sounds like those plans didn't exist. and at that point it's too late to start cooking imo. he dropped the ball pretty hard.", "Ok, so he did know you were excited.\n\nI think you could have spoken up a little sooner about what you expected rather than waiting for him to more definitively fail and then exploding. Sounds like you sat around for a bit watching him not make dinner or tell you the restaurant plan and didn't ask what was up. But he shouldn't really have needed that after he made an offer and you responded enthusiastically.", "Does he know that you get really frustrated if he makes a plan or suggestion and then isn't proactive about following through? \n\nI'm like you. I get excited about plans, even if it's just something basic like seeing my boyfriend who I see 5-6 times a week, and I get really sad or annoyed if he cancels. I've realized he doesn't fully understand how it affects me, and I think it's at least partially because he's more laid back about things changing. So I've had to be more explicit about how it makes me feel and also figure out how much it makes sense to be flexible and not take offense if something comes up. \n\nBut if you feel like there's a general pattern where you're responsible for all plans and he never picks up the slack, even when you're exhausted or its clear you're excited about a promise he made to do something, then it makes sense that this would be the last straw.", "> That didn\u2019t look like a snack to me\n\n6 french toast sticks for some people could absolutely be a snack. Me personally would not be full or fulfilled after 6 french toast sticks.", "I mean.. if hes seen you this upset this many times, then it's really hard to believe he didnt know how much having a nice dinner would mean to you. It feels very thoughtless, especially considering he offered.\n\nThis isnt a question of him not knowing how to offer, it sounds like it's a question of him caring enough to make you something nice. Just because 6 french toast sticks is good enough for him, doesn't mean it is or should be enough for you. You're too young for this, find a guy that will buy you flowers and make something nice during times like this.", "Nope your reaction was appropriate! You are not the Arsehole", "Truth be told\u2014 you\u2019re not reacting enough or taking this as seriously as you should. \ud83d\udc80 Unless this is just a casual relationship, why would you want a partner you can\u2019t rely on to follow through with a promise as simple as: \u201cI\u2019ll take care of dinner.\u201d A pattern is a pattern is an inevitability. Do you see a serious future with someone who doesn\u2019t even make an extra portion of food for you when he cooks, but expected you to treat the BOTH of you to a dinner HE promised to make/buy? \n\nThe bar is sinking below the floor. Stand up. Jeez.", "My reaction is not about the fact miscommunication happened but rather how it was reacted to.\n\nIm not Nerotypical so miscommunication happens with me a decent amount, If I misunderstood something then fine im in the wrong and im happy to try correct myself.\n\nHowever, if someone reacts badly to my attempt to correct like OP did then they are at fault.", "My brother also.

He has residuals from some songs he wrote for other bands. He is currently recording albums with 2 different bands. He plays in shows monthly-ish to stay in practice and because he likes it. He still mainly supports himself with an IT job. The other musicians he plays with all have \"day jobs\" as well.\n\nIt's really hard work to make a decent living in music.

Ordering food for herself only? I get that that was the right move for herself bc she needed to eat but I think it was inconsiderate, petty, and an asshole move to not include her bf in that when she was sitting right next to him. \n\nI also think it is interesting that because she didn\u2019t plan to feed herself for the day her bf is responsible for providing dinner for her but when she decides to order dinner at his place he is no longer a consideration bc now she is paying.", "Omg GIRL. You\u2019re lucky he had French toast sticks, the \u201caspiring musician\u201d I dated only ever had booze.", "Lol love, how far do you think he is going to go with this if he can't even follow through with dinner?", "I totally agree.
