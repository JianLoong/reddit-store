I just sat down?\"", "NTA\n\nPersonally, while how people handle this revelation is up to them, I would say that on the whole if I found out only years later that someone cheated on me I'd treat that unfaithfulness as current. The reason I say that is because, to me at least, it's not the freshness of the unfaithfulness that hurts, it's blow of knowing that the person in question didn't respect me enough to stay faithful muchless confess this. They'd kept it a secret.\n\nAlso, I'd toss out there that the offense of cheating is dated to when it is incurred not when the cheating occurs. That is to say, if you find out someone cheated on you thirty years ago you're still going to be hurt by it as if it was new. Being told, \"but I was faithful ever since, so you can't get mad at me,\" is just someone trying to micromanage your reaction. They're not actually apologetic at that point.", "NTA.

You expressed an opinion about what YOU would do in such a situation. Everyone has his or her deal-breakers in relationships. And you spoke from personal experience. It's your truth, and nothing more. \n\nI would give the message from a mutual \"friend\" very little weight. What type of friend spreads malicious tittle-tattle other than to cause trouble? A dog who brings a bone will carry one.  If Lea didn't express that remark to you directly, I'd ignore it - especially as it was a B.S. text.

She asked a question, and you gave your honest answer. If she lacks the maturity to understand that asking loaded questions can backfire on you, that is her issue, not yours.
