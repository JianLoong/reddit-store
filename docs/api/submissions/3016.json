Yes I'm aware of the age gap, all I'll say is that we really do believe age is just a number and our 25 year relationship speaks for itself.\n\nAbout a year after we started dating Tina got pregnant. This was a surprise to both of us. I didn't feel ready to become a dad young and Tina was still going through her divorce, so she didn't feel it was a good situation to bring a baby into. After much discussion we decided to put the baby up for adoption, and thankfully found a great, secure couple looking to adopt.\n\nWe didn't end up having any other kids of our own, but Tina has 2 daughters \"Lisa\" (36F) and \"Amy\" (33F). We had a rough start but it's been years and get along very well now. Amy's getting married very soon.\n\nA couple of years ago we got in contact with \"Liz\" (23F), my bio daughter, and she's doing well for herself. Liz sort of hated us at first, so I let it be and didn't push her. She's more open with the idea of knowing her bio parents now.\n\nLiz got offered a position in an interning program, and holding a small lunch to celebrate. She called asking if me and Tina would like to attend.\n\nThe issue is this is the same day as Amy's wedding. I explained that we wouldn't be able to attend because of this, Liz pushed and asked for the ceremony time. She said we could make it to her lunch and just leave early to get to the wedding, but she'd like it if we came.\n\nThis doesn't work at all because, again, Amy's wedding and we have to be there earlier than regular guests. Amy would be upset if we weren't there as well, so I told Liz it's just not possible.\n\nLiz got angry and said she never should've bothered asking us in the first place, and cut the call.\n\nLisa and Amy know what happened and they think we're in the right - again the wedding was planned first, and Liz's event is just a lunch, nowhere near as large scale as a wedding.\n\nBoth Tina and I sent a message to Liz after but she didn't reply to either, so she's clearly angry/upset.\n\nAITA for not attending her lunch?\n\nEdit: maybe I wasn't clear, but we weren't the ones that initially contacted Liz. Tina and Liz found each other on social media and messaged. Liz said she thinks Tina is her bio mom and Tina and I were interested to meet up, so they did.", "created_utc": 1669181679, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2gk2m/aita_for_telling_my_bio_daughter_who_we_didnt/", "score": 663, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You won't go to Liz's wedding (with a whole year to prepare, its a single day and a great honour to be invited, you should have moved mountains to go), and now you're also acting like missing her lunch isn't that big of a deal- it's a big deal *to her*, and that's what matters. I'm sure there are more stories too given that she \"hated\" you both at first.

How do you and Tina react to this? Because if you\u2019re allowing Amy to treat Liz badly that\u2019s an issue - especially given that what she is judging Liz for is\u2026 you and Tina having a child outside of wedlock. Something which Liz has no say in but you and Tina arguably do. How is your relationship with Amy? Is she fine with you and her mum and yet rude towards Liz? Because Liz could understandably be frustrated by that \n\nI\u2019m going with YTA because you\u2019ve hidden the above and so I\u2019m suspicious immediately.

Either Liz is younger than what you put, this is a something something missing info, or you should have thought about the ages.\n\nEither way, Liz has probably had enough of you and yours. The way Amy treats her with calling her a 'bastard girl' is just.... Yeah maybe you should just leave Liz alone so she can be with her family.\n\nEdit to add: Rereading your post and comments again, did you seek out Liz because you have no bio kids of your own besides her?

Yes I'm aware of the age gap, all I'll say is that we really do believe age is just a number and our 25 year relationship speaks for itself.\n\nAbout a year after we started dating Tina got pregnant. This was a surprise to both of us. I didn't feel ready to become a dad young and Tina was still going through her divorce, so she didn't feel it was a good situation to bring a baby into. After much discussion we decided to put the baby up for adoption, and thankfully found a great, secure couple looking to adopt.\n\nWe didn't end up having any other kids of our own, but Tina has 2 daughters \"Lisa\" (36F) and \"Amy\" (33F). We had a rough start but it's been years and get along very well now. Amy's getting married very soon.\n\nA couple of years ago we got in contact with \"Liz\" (23F), my bio daughter, and she's doing well for herself. Liz sort of hated us at first, so I let it be and didn't push her. She's more open with the idea of knowing her bio parents now.\n\nLiz got offered a position in an interning program, and holding a small lunch to celebrate. She called asking if me and Tina would like to attend. \n\nThe issue is this is the same day as Amy's wedding. I explained that we wouldn't be able to attend because of this, Liz pushed and asked for the ceremony time. She said we could make it to her lunch and just leave early to get to the wedding, but she'd like it if we came.\n\nThis doesn't work at all because, again, Amy's wedding and we have to be there earlier than regular guests. Amy would be upset if we weren't there as well, so I told Liz it's just not possible.\n\nLiz got angry and said she never should've bothered asking us in the first place, and cut the call. \n\nLisa and Amy know what happened and they think we're in the right - again the wedding was planned first, and Liz's event is just a lunch, nowhere near as large scale as a wedding.\n\nBoth Tina and I sent a message to Liz after but she didn't reply to either, so she's clearly angry/upset. \n\nAITA for not attending her lunch?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would be furious if it was me but not at the lunch event. More at the fact that both you and your wife were not teenagers when you had Liz. You took care of Tina's children but not your own. You and your wife were together 2 years before Liz was born yet you still put her for adoption. Tina is an AH especially when Liz was born she was not even young anymore she was already 38. Comes Liz wanting to probably fill that huge gap both you and your wife created yet again you have a reason to decline. You made your stepdaughters feel loved but how about your real daughter, the rejected one?", "YTA. You could have done both. In fact, it would have been even better to say, hey, we'll come to your lunch and after we will all goto the wedding.\n\nYea, but that's too normal and, you know, caring and stuff, much better to tell her to fuck off, again.", "From reading your comments and post, I\u2019m going to go with NAH in regards to you and your bio daughter. \n\nI think it\u2019s crappy that your wife was willing to put her up for adoption. I can understand you not feeling ready to be a parent at the time you had her - and that you have never filled much of a parental role to your step daughters, even to this day. \n\nI know you said your bio daughter reached out to you and your wife and not vice versa - so it seems like your bio daughter is the one mostly pursuing this relationship *and* has parental expectations from you both. It seems neither of you share these expectations of the relationship. \n\nYou seem to hold your bio daughter at friend or acquaintance level expectations, while she holds you two at parent-child expectations. Given these expectations (which seem to be largely unspoken between you), I think both her and your actions are reasonable: she wants her bio dad present for a milestone, while you can\u2019t make it because your wife\u2019s daughter has arranged for you to play a major role in a much larger milestone. You\u2019ve also declined to attend your bio daughters wedding (during which you are meant to be a guest, and presumably you are not actually very close with her) because of a major family event which has been in the works for several years. \n\nWould I put my priorities in the same order you\u2019ve put yours? No. But it seems you really aren\u2019t interested in fulfilling a parental role for your bio daughter, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for feeling that way. \n\nHOWEVER. You\u2019re now in a situation where it\u2019s clear that expectations are not being met OR discussed. In my opinion, you need to have a very straightforward conversation with your bio daughter about what it is you both expect from this relationship. You haven\u2019t said anything in your posts that indicates you\u2019ve made false promises, but I think you need to recognize that this is a very emotionally charged situation which calls for wise decision-making and strong communication. \n\nYour bio daughter has probably spent much of her life idealizing you, her bio mom, and what your relationship will be like when you can finally reconnect. She\u2019s probably not prepared for the fact that she wasn\u2019t ripped away from your unwilling arms, and thinks it\u2019s shocking that you\u2019re not dropping everything to put her first on your priority list, as your only biological child. While you have clearly not had much parental drive. Both of which are understandable and acceptable. \n\nYou need to have a difficult conversation with your bio daughter if the opportunity comes up. It may not, because these disappointments will be harsh enough already that she may wish to cut you off for good. If that\u2019s the case then you need to make sure you respect that (which, from your comments, seems to be your plan anyway). But if she continues to pursue this relationship as she has been, you need to make it clear that you don\u2019t intend to fulfill a parental role in her life, and what that means. She won\u2019t like it, and she\u2019s going to have to grieve this. But it would be better than having her continue to hang onto hope for something that will never happen. \n\nFinally, your step daughter should have been seriously reprimanded for calling your bio daughter a bastard. I get that it wasn\u2019t said to or around your bio daughter, but that behavior sucks and is unacceptable, even if you don\u2019t have a parental drive toward either of them. It\u2019s straight-up gross, as that language is a discriminatory, disparaging slur when used against adopted children. You don\u2019t have to be a parent to recognize that. So, honestly, both you and your wife should have done better in standing up for your bio daughter in that situation.", "NTA it\u2019s a bloody wedding! Why would you choose a lunch event with someone you didn\u2019t raise over a wedding of someone who you did raise I think", "YTA. Your comments are a catastrophe. I hope Liz takes this as a sign to never contact ya\u2019ll again.", "YTA. Both of you. Leave your step daughters out of this, too. Their opinion \n is completely irrelevant here. \n\nThis is much deeper and complex than the lunch being less flexible in rescheduling than the wedding. It sounds like you two really are not willing to integrate Liz into your lives. If she was, then wouldn't she already know the wedding was that same day? \n\nReunion is tough, really tough, but I think asking yourselves about what a relationship with your daughter actually looks like is absolutely critical here. She doesn't deserve to be treated like she is optional or inconvenient. Liz matters, too. She didn't choose to be relinquished by her parents. She is dealing with trauma you can't see (yes, even if she had a \"good life\" and is \"successful\"). I would implore you both to educate yourselves on the core issues of adoptees. Just Google that phrase and go from there.", "YTA Holy shit you aren't just an asshole this one time. You are a full time one", "YTA Liz dodged a bullet. You didn\u2019t want to be a young dad, but you were there for Amy\u2019s kids and still are now.

Of course, a wedding trumps luncheon, but that's not the real issue.\n\nYTA because you instigated this entire situation. If you accepted contact with your daughter, that means not excluding her from big events where it would be 110% appropriate for her to attend. E.g. her sister's wedding. So maybe, she's so pissed about the luncheon, because instead she finds out you can't come, because her sister is getting married and she's not invited on the same day she should be celebrating.\n\nThis could easily have been avoided.

She did a half ass try for about a year before ghosting him - I gotta say, it\u2019s no from the beginning and it\u2019s cruel to tease involvement and let them get a look at their bio family and then just shut the door. If you aren\u2019t ready to put your foot down with your step children and tell them to grow up and act right, stop playing around with Liz and stop contacting her. All or nothing and if you decide you want your actual flesh and blood kid in your life you need to start treating her like she\u2019s your kid and stop rejecting her. If you can\u2019t do that, stop being \u201cinterested\u201d and \u201ccurious\u201d and just leave her alone. She obviously at this point really wanted a relationship you\u2019re either unwilling or incapable of having with her. That goes for geriatric wifey too.", "Can you send her flowers? Sometimes a lunch is not just a lunch :)\n\nClearly you are not the asshole On any of the points that people might judge you. But Liz thinks you are. She\u2019s really dealing with abandonment. Keep being open and understanding.  NTA", "NTA\u2026quantity doesn\u2019t mean quality. \n\nAlso, let the girl go. You\u2019ve done enough.", "Nta", "the is no way you are the AH, a wedding is so much more than a luncheon...im sorry your bio is upset, but she is old enough to know what is more important.  she can do a celebration lunch with you guys the fallowing weekend. you cannot reschedule a wedding just for her. I know you want a better relationship with her but if she is going to be so mean why?", "NTA\n\nYou can choose whether u want to go or not\n\nWhy am I not surprised at the lack of hate?\n\nThere would be billions of haters if you were a 61M who impregnated a 20F when you were in your 40s", "Finally some positive age opinion! My husband and i are 66m 46f married for 22 years, nice to hear your relationship is as great as ours", "NTA. To keep the peace if it was close by, you *could* show up to the lunch in your wedding clothes, let everyone there know how proud you are of her, maybe give her a congratulations gift (good pen or something) and say \"hey, we'd love to stick around but as you can see we have a wedding to attend.\" That way you've shown up, and even if your daughter doesn't get it, literally everyone else will and might help her see that what you're doing is the right thing.", "Nta but I think its more of the fact that there was no compromise like taking her out to another lunch another time", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH, but as an adopted child, that would probably be the only time I gave an invitation to anything. The adoptee/bio family is so complicated and hard to navigate. There\u2019s a bit of trauma there, naturally, from being given up. Her wanting you there is definitely a big deal. I understand that the wedding is more important, but your bio daughter will probably put up walls completely, now. She\u2019s definitely entitled to her feelings. Both sides are understandable, and it\u2019s such a hard place to be in. You\u2019ve reflected her\u2026 more than once. She won\u2019t want to try again.", "Nta. But maybe offer a return olive branch and offer another time to have a lunch or a small celebration.", "NTA. You already gave up on her. I don't know what she expected", "ESH... Especially OP. First of all, so many wrongs in how you approached Liz. Why contact her now and after all these years? \nAlso why no invitation for Liz to Amy's wedding? All this could have been avoided is so.\nUnderstandably Liz is upset, but she cannot also expect the bio parents to ditch a wedding which is not easy to move, but a lunch can be moved. Could it be that she needed a reason to really cut you both out? And regardless of how unrealistic her invitation was, she needed to see how much you will go for her since you gave her up?", "NAH You couldn't go to both and you picked the event you had already committed to. It also makes sense that she was upset and felt rejected since she was reaching out for an important event in her life and felt overshadowed by her half sister.\n\nI also noticed that she hadn't been invited to the wedding, but that's getting into broader family dynamics.", "NTA but did you offer to take her out for a separate lunch on another day to celebrate?", "NTA A lunch isn't as important as a wedding.", "NTA about going to the wedding, but I\u2019m sure that felt like being rejected again to Liz. You shouldn\u2019t have reached out if y\u2019all were going to treat her like she isn\u2019t family. That makes y\u2019all AHs. Including Amy.

What the hell was the point? Cause more harm??\n\nShe grew up hating you beverages you gave her up, eventually she came around and tried to build a relationship with you, and you let her down again! \n\nDude, there\u2019s NOT even a single good reason to decline Liz invitation to get wedding when you\u2019re clearly prioritizing your stepdaughter\u2019s wedding.\n\nOn top of that, your stepdaughters rejects her and Liz thinks she is in any position to call Liz a bastard\u2026 what in the world!!?\n\nThat was your only bio-daughter, you gave her up because you felt too young to have a child, but you were already in a relationship with a woman (almost twice your age) who had two daughters, whom your 20ish young self ended up raising. Either way, based on how your stepdaughter turned out, you probably did Liz a favor.\n\nJust leave her alone! Stop calling her, stop trying to reach out. You\u2019ve been shitty enough already\u2026 go on and continue your life with your shitty wife and shitty stepdaughters, I\u2019m sure that will be very fulfilling as you get older.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for prioritizing your stepdaughter\u2019s wedding over a lunch, that\u2019s a no brainer. But you\u2019re definitely an AH for everything else.", "NTA but maybe offer to take her to lunch to celebrate on a different day?

You can\u2019t just show up late to your stepdaughter\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m sure it feels bad for Liz, but it\u2019s just a lunch. Can\u2019t she reschedule?", "How about this, since you couldn't make it to her actual lunch for the event take her out on another day. Don't be cheap here you owe her for the whole rejecting her a second time after she offered and olive branch thing. Obviously you can't make it because you know you have a prior commitment, but you could try and make it up to her another way. Until you try to make things better YTA, but if you offer and she still chooses to reject then NAH you tried, but she was done. But, try first.", "Tina's family is originally from a country in Europe. We were meant to go back in 2020, but that couldn't happen for obvious reasons. After rescheduling everything and the timing, we're going next year. Liz's wedding falls during our trip. It's just bad timing all around, otherwise we would've gone.\n\nAlso our roles in Liz and Amy's weddings are very different. For Amy's, Tina is the mother of the bride and I'm helping out with a lot of things too. For Liz's, we were invited as guests.

They tell her they aren\u2019t coming. \n\nLiz invites parents to an important lunch. They tell her they aren\u2019t coming. Because they ARE going to her half- sisters wedding. \n\nWhich she wasn\u2019t invited to. \n\nBut you know, is a wedding they ARE attending. \n\nI assume OP is hurting that info in the comments because he knows they are effing assholes.

She has her own family - both parents, a brother and her fiance.", "Thank you I was wondering when someone would say this.  What gets me they gave up their bio daughter but kept the stepdaughters. And they wanted someone else to raise their daughter.", "[deleted]", "Yes. It isn't about the exact event. It's that she tried to treat you like family and got reminded that she's not actually family - she wasn't invited to her half sister's wedding.", "Have you noticed the comments, where OP refused to go to Lisa's wedding? It is not just another rejection, it is whole road of rejections in a row.", "Or make it work.", "Man the more I read your comments I changed to YTA. Please leave the girl alone. Going forward if you guys sound just terrible.", "YTA.\n\nThere's another rejection. They RSVP'd 'no' to Liz's wedding next year.", "NTA but perhaps you could invite Liz to lunch another day to celebrate. Tell her you know it\u2019s not the same as attending the lunch she organized and you understand if she declines but your sorry you couldn\u2019t attend but still wanted to celebrate her.", "NTA - On my wedding day my parents and in-laws were working with the venue right at 10am all the way until the ceremony started at 4pm. I also don\u2019t understand all of this not inviting your half sister to your wedding thing.

Just read Amy called her a \u201cbastard\u201d. That\u2019s completely uncalled for. I\u2019m changing to ESH solely due to that reason alone. Your step children need to grow up.\n\nEdit 2: The more I read the comments the more you lose me. YTA. Liz is dying on the wrong hill but she is clearly right in dropping you and your family off the face of the earth.

This waste of space threw away his kid because he didn't want to be a young dad, bit was a stepdad to Tina's other daughters, and now he reaches out, and can't understand why that kid, now an adult, was angry with them, when they keep reminding her that she doesn't matter. When is this AH the one that reached out!!", "No OP is definitely YTA for hiding very relevant info in the comments, like the fact him and wife RSVPd \u201cno\u201d to Liz\u2019s wedding before this happened.", "My one thing is surely Amy is her sister?\n\nWhy had no one told her earlier that her *sister* was getting married that day and therefore she probably wouldn't have planned a lunch that day?", "Yeah I think I'll just let it be for now, and if she wants to come around she can.

The kindest thing OP can do at this point is tell Liz that he isn't interested in cultivating a relationship. There's nothing worse than false hope. \n\nI kind of, sort of understand why Tina is prioritizing the daughters she raised -- but from the comments, it sounds like OP didn't have any hand in raising them himself and is actually fairly emotionally distant. Why can't HE choose to prioritize Liz even if Tina doesn't? She is his only child. \n\nSomething tells me Tina is firmly in control here, which is consistent with their age difference. 61 and 40 something doesn't bother me but 40 something and 20 does -- I'm 41 and a 20 year-old would hit my radar as an absolute child.

We came back together again when she was early 20s, and I had visited her as a child.\n\nThe pain and trauma we both have due to the adoption cannot be overstated. She was bought up well by my uncle who was wealthy and didn\u2019t want for anything. But there is something visceral about being taken from your immediate family that is difficult to heal. Your daughters adoptive family will love her but cannot take the place of her birth family. It\u2019s some kind of inbuilt emotion, like getting upset when your baby cries.\n\nShe no doubt felt that she had stabilised this trauma / buried it / let it go.

I hope you\u2019re all ashamed of yourselves. YTA.", "Then why reach out to her in the first place? She's already doing well and you just caused unnecessary drama by introducing yourselves just to reject her over and over again. You and your wife are the worst.

The main energy and focus would naturally be on step daughter that day. Likely with toasts about her childhood and what good parents she had. It would have been like rubbing salt in the wound for the bio daughter. \n\nInstead, if I were OP, I would have explored hosting the lunch or dinner for the bio daughter to celebrate her and her achievement on another day.

A 35-yr-old getting into a relationship with a 20-yr-old is iffy, so I can't blame her for being uncomfortable with it, but this anger should be directed at her mother, not you, and definitely not Liz.

I get that the wedding of your \u201cnot bastard\u201d daughter is more important to you, but are you doing anything at all to celebrate her? Flowers? A card? Something? \n\nAlso, why TF have you already RSVP\u2019d no to her wedding? \n\nI mean, you and your family are terrible people regardless, but I\u2019d genuinely like to hear your excuse. \n\nFor the bot: YTA, but that\u2019s in general.", "So why did you rspv no to Liz\u2019s wedding?", "Why did you contact Liz? \n\n\nWhy did you RSVP no to Liz\u2019s wedding?", "It's an attention ploy imo. I have never in my adult life asked my parents to a workplace function. It's never even been a thing a coworker did. Just seems like an odd request. If she can't understand that a wedding is hectic enough without a side trip for lunch, then she has a tremendous amount of growing up still left to do.", "Holy crap.", "That\u2019s awesome! It\u2019s a little dusty in here now. \ud83e\udd79", "That\u2019s not what I said at all.", "He was already being a step dad to Tina\u2019s other kids though. If he \u201cwasn\u2019t ready\u201d then he shouldn\u2019t have been with someone who had kids either.", "Right? I would have taken my kid and ran. I would not have stuck around to raise my partner's kids while she refused to raise ours together. \n\nMy partner's dad left her when she was 4 to be raised by her alcoholic mother because they broke up. He remarried and ended up raising his stepkids. Later he ended up raising his stepkids kids. My partner ended up in foster care.\n\nHis reasons why he left and never bothered contacting her? Because he didnt want to seperate her and her half siblings. As if shared custody was not a thing...They talk on the phone once a year now or so... My  partner does not care about him whatsoever but she is polite. \n\nIs he in contact with his stepkids or their kids anymore? Nope. He and his wife divorced after 30 years. The kids and grandkids pledged allegience to their mother. I hope it was worth it op. Now he is alone.\n\nWhere will you be op when your spouse most likely dies first?", "Still have four hours after my break to qork and am a terrible insomniac.

He is 45 now.", "The post says they had dated for a year, so you\u2019re supposing that Tina was cheating on her husband?

It makes one question however. How her stance is now. Even if she doesn't say it, does she still think it? Does it influence you?", "A half sister is still a sister.", "oh true thanks for that. ugh still iffy age gap even tho it worked out. also, they are quite horrible to their bio daugther whose peace they disturbed only to be disappointed every step of the way and called a bastard.", "Ehh, just because they\u2019re still together doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy. OP\u2019s passivity with regards to Amy\u2019s horrible comment is a red flag to me \u2014 not what he\u2019s asking about, but not necessarily entirely irrelevant if you ask me.", "Yeah, age gaps seem to be far less problematic when the woman is older. At least in my experience(s).\n\nIn their case, I don\u2019t know. But yikes.", "Her daugters were 8 and 11 \u2014 old enough to be partially self-sufficient. It was probably easier for OP to digest being like their older brother (even if that's super weird) rather than being their dad.\n\nHe just didn't want to deal with a baby.", "Oh no I'm not shaming stepparents I have a lot of respect for them but him no way he is the lowest of the low why reach out to her to get her hopes up just to yank the rug out from under her", "I think to me its weird he \"didnt wanna be a young dad\" but in the same time frame took on Tina's daughters and helped raised them.

It's a family meal to celebrate a milestone.", "I mean, if we\u2019re following Amy\u2019s logic then yeah, that pretty much checks out. Smdh, some people..", "Fair enough, just pointed this out as it really seems best for \"liz\" to stay far away from both of her bio parents and it's really telling that they both just go along with such a comment.", "When me and Tina started dating, Tina and her then husband were separated but not officially divorced. Lisa and Amy were pretty distant from me, but we've gone past that and get along much better now.", "Yes he did because he and his wife has a trip planned and at Amy's wedding they got roles while at Liz wedding they will be just guests still not a good reason", "Wait Liz's wedding? It's a work lunch event not wedding according to the post", "Here is a not as friendly reminder OP\ud83e\udee5.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re sparkling clean, I just think that in this particular case the age gap is a red herring.", "I completely agree. That is just sick.", "\"I don't wanna be a young parent\" is not an excuse for me in 95% of the cases.

And still allow ur step children to bad mouth her? Remember when ur old ur wife\u2019s kids won\u2019t care about you. They will care about their old mom and dad. Not you.", "Just seen the his comment", "It seems like Liz invited them to her wedding at one point and they chose to go on a trip to Europe instead.
