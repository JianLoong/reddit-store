AITA for keeping the item and my money?\n\nedit: paragraphs\n\nedit: adding some more info:\n\n1. The seller wasn't particularly kind of helpful when they thought they had the power. They said that they will accept a return minus shipping costs. but they didn't act on that. more so - even that solution seems unfair, as I would be paying shipping twice in that scenario for no fault of mine.\n2. Even though the item was listed in pristine condition, it had stains on it. so I felt that even that wasn't accurate.\n3. I'm not sure it's an innocent seller. It could be that the seller bought the item at discount and then after using it, tried to sell it at full price. there are two pieces of evidence to corroborate that - 1. the item is from 2021, and according to the seller they only used it for 6 months. and 2. the seller was quick to adjust the price to a lower price, basically asking me to keep the item for $600.\n4. Seller didn't give a reason for why they didn't respond for 5 days. I also didn't ask. They just called me a scammer, which I think is unfair.
