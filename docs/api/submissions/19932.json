Because that's giving someone privacy in a public place, so your argument there is invalid.\n\nAlso refusing to respect someone's boundaries because you don't agree with them or think they're rediculous just makes you an even bigger AH.

I was checking in on a first flight to a destination where the airline started operating. The airline's marketing staff took my photo unbeknownst to me and posted it on their official Facebook page to advertise the new flight routes. My face was clearly identifiable in the photo. I wasn't even aware of this until several acquaintances asked me about my trip upon seeing my photo on the airline's FB page.

Think about it, if you needed consent to take pictures in public of people the paparazzi wouldn't exist! \n\nUnfortunately tiktok has brought out the worst in many people and they should not be doing what they do, but unfortunately there's no laws against it.
