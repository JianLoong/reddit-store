I hope you\u2019ve able to find some peace and solace now later in life by finding TRUE friends who actually respect your wishes.. \n\nI have only got a few friends after my life turned to absolute shit hell on Earth, but they all respect me and DON\u2019T take photos of me unless I say it\u2019s okay. Which is rare.. because I absolutely HATE myself and what I am..", "then your \"friends\" are shit, but a stranger taking photos of the city is completely different. \n\n\nIf every time someone took a photo, they announced it so they could get consent from everyone(strangers) in the surrounding area that they *might* end up in a photo,,,, people would think they were nuts and complain about them for inconveniencing their day for something so stupid. \n\n\nbut if your current friends like taking photos and want you in them but you're still uncomfortable, I'd just compromise and maybe get a lil teddy and dress it up like you, so when people look at photos they still know you were there and having fun but it's still respectful to you. They get a photo of \"you\" for the memories & you're not in any photos, win/win?", "If someone asks you to delete those pictures, wouldn't you? You can always take new photos of the same building since the guy asking is not the focus of them. It shouldn't be a big deal. \n\nIf that person asks you in a disrespectful way, you still are the AH if you don't delete them. Two wrongs...", "They can have a reason why they don't want their picture taken. Thay could have asked nicely? Sure. But OP here could have taken the high road but they didn't making them TA.\n\nOP's comments show that they don't care wether or not they're an AH, just if they're in the clear legally.", "FYI: depending on where you live, posting a persons face online without consent is in fact illegal. public place or not. (except when it's a large group, then the photographer is off the hook because it's deemed impossible to ask that many people for consent)\n\nit's the \"right to one's personal image\".\n\nso no, the photographer does not have 'every right'. he has to ask permission, regardless of attitude or niceness of the photographed.", "I dare you to link this post to your followers so they can see how you really are.", "[removed]", "This dude didn\u2019t claim to be a private investigator nor an investigative journalist. This is false equivalency.", "How are you not getting the difference?\n\nThere is no LEGAL expectation of privacy in a public place. However, this sub is not \"am i the criminal,\" it is \"am I the asshole,\" and taking someone's picture without their permission and then promptly refusing to delete it upon request to teach them a lesson in manners? That's an *asshole.*", "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with cultivating an audience and being proud of that, but using that as an excuse to invade someone\u2019s privacy is a dick move. It\u2019s entitled and selfish.", "Would you actually delete it though? If they had asked nicely?", "it's not up to you to punish strangers who you deem impolite. if you're taking pictures in public, you have to listen to those who don't want to photographed.", "Not to mention\u2026 a private photo of Disney land that your family might see online or you might have printed and framed in a private home is NOT the same as a photography instagram account with 20k followers. Plus Disneyland is a vacation spot, no one lives in Disneyland, but this person probably lives in the area they were photographed and now 20k people know where that is.", "As someone who likes to travel I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s realistic. You would want me to go up to dozens of people 20+ feet away in a crowded foreign city and ask each of them if they minded their blurry but technically visible face being in an instagram post that will probably get 30 likes?", "Imo if the person isn\u2019t blurry or barely visible you should attempt to ask. There was another person in these comments that said their stalker found them from a random photography account by recognizing their hair and tattoos. Blurring faces doesn\u2019t always do much and even though there\u2019s no legal obligation, it\u2019s still the respectful thing to do. If you don\u2019t post them it\u2019s not a huge deal, but like I said, it\u2019s still the best case to ask.", "Dopamine based motivation is a bizarre thing. Adrenaline can metabolize like dopamine.", "Generally speaking taking photos out and about like op, is about taking pictures of life being lived in cities, intentionally avoiding taking pictures of people kind of ruins the point but op should blur the guys face, also the reason you shouldn't expect any privacy in public is because from home to work your probably watched the whole way forward and backward by more then 30 cameras of which only 10 or so are protected from outside access the rest are easily watched by anyone and websites exist specifically for watching through them , also if privacy is important to you then you should never take any pictures outside ever because the position of literally every building, water or cell tower and billboard is enough to triangulate your location using modern programs via Google maps", "Disney music is of course copyrighted and Disney loves to go after anyone poaching their music. It may deter the \"privacy pirates\"  from filming or posting.\ud83d\ude00", "In the US, you can't use a person's image FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES without their consent, even if it was made in a public location.   The airline should not have used your image without what is called a \"model release.\". Again, this is in the US", "Your projecting your feelings about your situation onto the situation with OP. First of all, OP accidentally got the person in the pictures. He wasn't purposely taking pictures of the man. And also the man was rude and aggressive. You get more bees with honey. It's ridiculous everyone bases their judgments here based on preconceived notions, past experiences that are similar and not the exact situation at hand. You clearly can't look at this situation objectively and without inserting your own negative emotions from something that happened tovyou that has nothing to do with OP or this situation at all. Someone taking your photo without consent and then posting it is COMPLETELY different than someone accidentally catching someone in frame and then refusing to delete it because said person was super aggressive and a jerk", "This comment is false.

If someone were to happen into my shot and ask for me to delete their photo, you delete it.

Part of being in public is sharing that space with other people. \n\nSo if you truly have a big hang up about this and you don\u2019t want to be in a stranger\u2019s photo, you still have to recognize that you\u2019re in public and you walked into someone else\u2019s photo. So the person deleting the photo is doing you a favor if they agree, and you need to approach it like that and not be a jerk."]}
