I would like to mention, however, that my church is absolutely amazing, and my church family is one of the most supportive, and loving church communities I\u2019ve seen. This is all my parents! It's sad they are making me resent my true family so much.

They sadly don\u2019t care about you. If you\u2019re old enough, check to see if you can stay with other family members or friends to help you become more independent.", "NTA\n\nstick to your guns and keep refusing.\n\nQuestion what the hell is trunk or treat.", "I'm not familiar with what a 'trunk or treat' is but at 17 you are old enough to determine if you want to go to church or do church activities for yourself.  Forcing someone to go to church rarely works out well and I'm a Christian who is very involved with my church, but no one should be forced to go.  NTA.", "NTA Just remind them of 2 Corinthians 9:7 That should be the end of it. If you still want to participate in your own way, how about cleaning up or something in the background? There are many ways to participate without dressing up and handing out candy. I have run many Trunk or Treats in my day. Between parking, crowd control, trash pick and such, there is always something that needs to be done.", "NTA. You parents probably think they are helping you find god. They aren\u2019t. You can\u2019t force these things.", "You\u2019re not lazy or selfish. You have your own views while living your own life and you are entitled to those. Your parents don\u2019t give you the support you deserve. NTA", "NTA and so sorry.   Hopefully you will be out of the hosue soon.", "NTA at 17 you should be doing just this - choosing some independence and things you want to do or not do for your own reasons. Adulting is hard and making your own choices is the right step forward.", "NTA.  Your parents sound like a nightmare.  Hope your future plans are to move as far away from them as possible.", "NTA. Your parents are lazy and selfish for dragooning you into doing their work in their way under their conditions. They also lied about the most recent project. They will continue trying to guilt you into things they want because it has worked.\n\nCongratulations on finally starting to pull away from this!", "NTA. It's important to maintain your boundaries and prioritize your own well-being, especially when you've been forced into participating in events that make you uncomfortable or anxious. Your parents should respect your feelings and independence, and it's not fair for them to push you into things that you've expressed a strong dislike for. You have the right to say no to something that affects your mental and emotional health. It's not about being lazy or selfish; it's about self-care and setting boundaries.", "NTA \u2014 You can put your foot down (and should) but you\u2019ll be up against your parents on this. You\u2019re certainly not lazy or selfish.\n\nI, would get a part time job. It\u2019s hard to call you lazy if you\u2019re already working. It\u2019ll build skills and hopefully allow you to same some money and maybe be able to move out when you\u2019re a bit older. It\u2019ll give you some future independence and help you gain some life experience outside of school and family.", "My impulse would be to tell them Halloween is of the devil and for the church to sponsor such an event is Satanist and horrific. But don't do that, you'll just get in more trouble.\n\nObviously you know your parents like to demand you have \"fun\" their way or not at all; do whatever gets you through things, and plan to leave their home as soon as you're old enough. You're NTA here.", "NTA --- Tell your parents by them forcing you to go to church and take part in stuff your don't want to its pushing you towards Atheism and would they rather that.", "NTA and not lazy or selfish. Please don\u2019t ever think this about yourself or believe them.

This is why I absolutely despise organized religion (I was indoctrinated into the Southern Baptist Church at a very early age). For some reason, it turns parents and some who aren't parents, abusive. \nYou're not selfish and you're not lazy, they're just controlling. Protect yourself the best that you can and get out as soon as you can.", "I have been doing that! Easily the best, most laid-back week of my life. I don\u2019t have the pressure and obsessiveness of my parents constantly breathing down my back. Going to be visiting family more, to say the least lol.", "You decorate your car\u2019s trunk with a Halloween theme and hand out candy to children lol but of course, my family doesn't only do that. \n\nThey build these huge props from paper mache and foam, then come up with at least 4 activities so the kids can earn their candy. \n\nIt's honestly really cool if you\u2019re not being forced into doing it and embarrassing yourself in front of your friends.", "Cars are parked in the church lot, and their trunks have elaborate decorations and candy or treats, and the children go from car to car to see the decoration and get their goodies. There's usually some kind of entertainment as well, though at a church it may be a religious in nature.", "I do that every year and would love to do it this year as well, but they are so infuriated at the fact I am my own person and can make my own decisions. \n\nI hope this doesn't sound bad, but I don\u2019t want to do it for 2 reasons. \n\n1. My parents need to learn that I\u2019m almost an adult and I can make my own decisions.\n\n2. Because it is this church\u2019s trunk-or-treat. \n\nIt honestly makes me sick thinking about the amount of \u201cgolden years\u201d I\u2019ve wasted just sitting in church. If it was a trunk-or-treat hosted by anything else (even another church) I would be ecstatic to participate.", "I agree. I'm still trying to figure out what I am without being biased. I think I'm Christian, but my parents make me hate religion at the same time. It\u2019s so weird lol.", "It\u2019s definitely not the church, it\u2019s all my parents.

My parents are the issue 100% and I absolutely adore my church family!", "Hey, want a perfect way to avoid the trunk or treat?  Tell the 'rents that you refuse to engage in idolatry and blasphemy in celebrating a pagan holiday.  You will of course pray for their souls to return to the path of Jesus even as they engage in heathen acts under the guise of church activity.", "Thank you!  That makes sense!", "Some schools around here do it too.", "You do not sound bad at all. You are absolutely correct and your feelings are valid. \n\nSometimes people get wrapped up in impressing the Pastor. There may be no reasoning with your parents even thought you\u2019re perfectly reasonable and plenty old enough to make this decision.   \n\n\nIs there a youth Pastor that you could talk to and have them intervene on your behalf? It\u2019s too late for this particular situation, but for the future?", "NTA and frankly see if you can move in with aunts /uncles or grandparents and away from your controlling ah s parents.", "Perhaps spiritual...a belief in a God but not in organized religion is how I describe it", "something similar to this happened to me too, actually. i\u2019m in college now and able to approach spirituality and religion without any external pressure. it\u2019s important to consider what you need from your parents, though, instead of cutting them off. i need my parents to pay for college, and it\u2019s okay to be very distant from them emotionally as long as you get what you need out of the relationship. i hope everything goes well for you, good luck!", "It isn\u2019t weird at all. Mankind makes religion and mankind divides itself. Let not the folly on man distract you from the light of Christ.", "I edited the comment. Your parent\u2019s interpretation of how you should involve yourself is certainly an issue. You should look at how to best distance yourself from your parents being so controlling. Building your own boundaries might allow for a more healthy relationship later even if it is difficult now. I would get a part time job while you\u2019re in school though.", "From your description of your parents I didn't really think that would really be an option for you anyway my comment was just to try and get you to have a laugh when you thought about the look on their faces if you were to say something like that to them. good luck in the future and remember when you hit 18 your legally an adult and then it gets even more harder for them to tell you what you can or can't do.", "I 100% agree and I\u2019ve been trying to before I posted this. One of the best weeks I\u2019ve had, and within the 1 week of my being there, there were even positive physical side effects! \n\nMy skin cleared up and I got into better shape. It was amazing without my parents!\n\nI also just wanted to mention I did not mean to sound rude in my reply to you, just wanted to clear the air a bit!", "Pfthaha their faces would be absolutely priceless. They would be so mad! And there is truth in what you say, it has had a toll on my religious beliefs. Again, thank you for making this holiday a bit more bearable!"]}
