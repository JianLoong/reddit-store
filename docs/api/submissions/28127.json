She needs to not be a princess. You did the reasonable thing and left the apartment.

You can probably change it up - move a little further away, don't leave the light on - but having a tantrum about it when you had made efforts is childish AH behavior. You maybe need to find better travelling companions than this C.", "Um, YMMV. I'd be cool with anyone wanting to talk on the phone during my waking hours on our joint holiday, really  less  cool at 6:30 and within earshot.", "Especially when it was C\u2019s budget that dictated this small studio where they are on top of each other", "I wish?

You guys don\u2019t drink coffee on your way to work?", "But outside of the Airbnb though? The time difference is such that during the day here it\u2019s nighttime there. At 6:30 here is almost 10pm there. So what does one have to do?", "For me a coffeeshop is a place where i meet other people to chat and have fun together. If i want a coffee just to drink it quickly on the way to somewhere else, I'd make it myself at home, much cheaper and much easier (and faster than standing in line somewhere!)", "You\u2019re absolutely fine and have nothing to feel guilty or bad about. She completely overstepped by being mad that you accidentally woke her up. If you\u2019d been doing it the entire trip every morning that\u2019d be a different story. But you weren\u2019t and this is the first time she woke up. Also, 6:30 is honestly not that early for waking up on a vacation\u2026.depending on the type, if it\u2019s a beach versus actual traveling. \nI would not recommend not turning any lights on. One light is fine to have on as long as it\u2019s not right in her face or something like that. Besides, she\u2019d probably get mad if you tripped over something because you didn\u2019t have any lights on, for her, and \naccidentally stubbed your toe or something. Coffee shop option is just ehhh. Hard no. You\u2019d have to get dressed, look somewhat put together, spend money on a coffee and what not, and also be surrounded by strangers when having a personal conversation. \nTo be honest, I\u2019d just ask her what exactly woke her up. Like, the light, your voice, what was it? If she can\u2019t respond she\u2019s mad just to be mad. If she does have an answer, tell her you\u2019ll make sure to not have that happen again or be a bit more quiet the rest of the times. \nIf she can\u2019t accept a compromise or a resolution, just tell her to get earplugs and get over it.", "The time difference is a big factor, I see. NTA as it was accidental, she shouldn't have screamed like that."]}
