Denise has made it very clear that she wouldn't miss her mother's wedding for the world and will be going on this trip.\n\nBecause I normally do the planning for the trips Denise and I go on, she asked me to look into a lot of the finer details of the Nigeria visit which I was happy to do. However, whenever I would look up something like necessary vaccinations or the wait time on a visa, I would see a large red \"**TRAVEL ADVISORY**\" banner at the top of the page warning people from the US not to go to this country for any reason.\n\nI may be biased but I believe Denise is very attractive and has a collection of physical features that make her stand out in many places in the US, let alone an African country (She looks almost exactly like Merida from Brave if you want a visual). I'm sure that Matt is a stand-up guy but I'm not really sure what he could do if they got into a genuinely dangerous situation involving less savory individuals.\n\nI avoided bringing the topic up for a very long time because I knew that Denise wouldn't be receptive to the risk, but eventually my anxiety bubbled over, and I asked her why she and her mother couldn't fly Matt to the US instead since they would need to wait for a visa and purchase tickets either way. She responded by saying that she also wanted to take the opportunity to see the country. I brought up my concerns about the country's safety and Denise got very defensive, insisting that I was being paranoid and worrying about nothing. I pressed the issue and Denise refused to budge an inch, completely shutting down the conversation.\n\nShe no longer talks to me about the trip, and I haven't been asked to help with the planning since.\n\nAm I the Asshole?  \n\n\n**EDIT:** For those asking what Matt thinks about the trip, or any questions about him in general, I don't have good answers for you. Neither myself nor Denise speak to him very often. I don't have a good way to contact him especially now that I'm being excluded from the planning and Denise doesn't care to.
