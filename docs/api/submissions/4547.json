People pay good money for these shows and then they are disrupted by kids and their parents do not care at all. The mother should be taken the kid out if they wont stop talking it's distracting to other people. Next time I highly suggest you tell an usher and they can talk to the mother for you. That's what they're there for and you don't need to get involved directly.", "NTA. These kinds of parents are literally the worst. I would have gotten my money back.", "NTA. Don't take your small children to a performance show if they can't keep quiet and disrupts the other guests. Or at the very least she could've left with her toddler for a few minutes until the kid calmed down.", "NTA! The parents who refuse to parent or have any kind of common courtesy for other people are the worst! The kinds that think they're entitled to let their children run amok while everyone else has to suffer is inconsiderate, selfish, rude & shouldn't be tolerated. People who think it's okay to disturb others and let their kids do the same do a disservice to everyone - including the kids who will grow up thinking they don't have to respect anyone because their parents allow them to encroach on & bother everyone else. Smh. Definitely NTA! The mother should have taken the kids out of the theater - that simple!", "NTA. Equivalent to taking a crying baby to movie theater. You know your kids, you know they'll be like that. So DON'T GO or hire a baby sitter. Why should other people suffer just so ONLY you can enjoy the show.", "NTA. Those people were AH to bring a kid that young to the show. It\u2019s horribly inconsiderate. Instead of leaving, I would have found an usher during intermission and ask it he could handle the situation so that everyone could enjoy the show they paid to see.", "NTA You take the toddler to the other show.  If you do take the toddler to this show and they are not quiet, you walk out with them.  Do people not do this anymore?", "NTA. Some theaters have a warning for noise people make and how children should be handled by their parents.", "NTA.  Well done for standing up to her.  You could have taken it up with the theatre, arguing that you were unable to enjoy the show; you'd probably get a partial refund, and more importantly, it would motivate the theatre to make it clear what behavior is expected.", "**NTA**\n\nBut the next time this goes on for more than a couple of minutes, go get an usher. It is their job to \"politely encourage\" disruptive people (or people with small, disruptive children) to leave the theatre until they (or their offspring) can stop disrupting the performance, which is also stressful for performers, who very much appreciate your tagging in and getting a staff member to deal with it.\n\nLet me be clear, BTW: I adore small children, and I believe there is a place for them in the theatre. And I will death-glare the first person who tries to chalk this up to \"maybe the child was neurodivergent\". Nope. I have worked with small children off and on for over 30 years. And I AM AUTISTIC, and my parents started taking me to the theatre when I was a toddler. They began with dedicated children's theatre, but I actually went to see The Nutcracker (coincidentally) at Canada's National Arts Centre theatre when I was 4 years old. My tiny autistic self behaved beautifully, I'm told. I was rapt. Well . . . okay, at intermission it's possible that I went out to the lobby and danced my little heart out, including my party dress somehow ending up over my head from all my tiny ballerina excitement, hahaha. But it seems that there was applause, so nothing disruptive. \n\nAnd the important point is this: it was made VERY CLEAR to me (as it always was on theatre outings) that once the lights came down in the theatre, my mouth was to stay shut, that it was a Very Special Privilege to be allowed to go to the theatre like a grownup, and see something so beautiful, and that if I couldn't be quiet and sit nicely (either in my seat or on my mum's lap), then I would have to leave. No fuss, but we couldn't stay either. Loud, fussy children aren't allowed to stay and disrupt other people's enjoyment. \n\nSmall children can absolutely be taken to the theatre - even to non-child-specific showings. But learning how to behave is, in fact, a learning process, and one that parents have to be willing to be actively involved in. And if they aren't willing to put in the work, then events where they are disruptive to others and to the performers who work SO HARD are probably not for their family.\n\nAll of which is a long way of saying: you are absolutely NTA, but in future please don't let anyone ruin it for you. The ushers and theatre staff are there to support your enjoyment of the show. Let them do that. They're usually stationed around the theatre for exactly that reason, so you can easily grab one and ask for their assistance.", "NTA.

Especially when you\u2019ve established that the parents aren\u2019t going to do anything.\n\nI do think that being able to hear the show though is not an unreasonable expectation, unless it is a relaxed or kids\u2019 performance, which is obviously different altogether. Head ushers *may* be able to move you if the issue is not resolved by speaking to the other party, at their own discretion, if the show is not sold out.\n\nI also think throwing tots in at the deep end with a full length ballet (or play, or film) is a bit much to ask of them, and maybe they should have managed expectations or worked out a better way of communicating. I was a very inquisitive kid but I sat on my dad\u2019s knee and whispered questions in his ear if I had any. And I had about 156 in the first three minutes.\n\nAnd in this instance, taking the kid outside for a couple of minutes to answer their questions and to explain that she needs to whisper to her parents would have been fairer to everybody.\n\nBut I also do think that some element of audience noise comes with the territory of matinee shows.

They are very pretty and lovely to watch, but unless your local company has made a lot of changes, there isn't any actual plot happening there, and the characters introduced in the first half just kind of watch for most of act II. Especially for kids who are already struggling to understand what is happening without any dialogue, it's a slog.\n\nBut that's just the nature of the beast. It's marked as a great introductory ballet and fun for the whole family, so you sort of have to accept that there will be children and other people there who are not familiar with ballet and the expected norms, and who struggle to sit still and quiet for so long.

That\u2019s not something you\u2019d think to look for unless you know they offer. \n\nAnd if you can only go one night and look for tickets for that night, would the kids shows even show up? \n\nShe should have left until the kid was settled, but I get why they may not have realized to go to a kids only show.", "NTA.\n\nYou were right, both of you, and this woman was angry you pointed it out.\n\nShe's the asshole - to that whole section and to her kid.\n\nTake kids to kid shows. Don't force them to sit through something boring.", "NTA. I understand wanting to TRY to take your child to a theatre production however if I had done that with my son and he wouldn't stop talking or being disruptive we would have left. I don't understand why people don't do that! Experiences are how they learn but not at the expense of everyone else that has paid.", "NTA. This is where you say, loudly, \u201ceither keep quiet or leave, I didn\u2019t pay to hear your constant jabber\u201d. \nTrust me it works. I\u2019ve had to do it quite a few times.", "\u2026look it\u2019s the nutcracker. This is like complaining you\u2019re not getting an A in the class. You\u2019re in this performance because you don\u2019t have the necessary expertise and talent to be in meaningful or artistic productions. It\u2019s meant to be a \u201ccome all\u201dperformance, and the kids count.", "I saw Black Panther like this. Dad brought his 4-ish year old son, kid was scared by the fights and explosions. Poor little guy kept asking Dad if people would be ok or if they were hurt. He started crying during one of the fight scenes. Dad just sat there and went \"sssh\" occasionally. It was heartbreaking.", "Ballet of any kind is not for toddlers. They don't have mental capacity to comprehend what's happening, which is why that child was constantly talking.", "Let\u2019s suppose she did. It is still her responsibility as a parent to teach her child how to behave in public. This is a long thing to take a toddler too and parents need ato be prepared.", "I agree. That why I said \u201cthe mom should have taken her out\u201d\n\nBut OP seems upset the kid was even at a regular performance. And should have known better that there were kids performances. That\u2019s not necessarily true.", "Utter nonsense", "I\u2019m so sorry! I do consider your experience a bit different though. While I would generally have no patience for anyone interrupting a ballet/opera/symphony, I would expect children to be at a Nutcracker matinee. I sympathize with OP, but I think his expectations were unrealistic for this particular performance. (You, on the other hand, were absolutely right not to expect similar distractions at a three hour opera which holds no special appeal to children.)", "Since they specifically offer children friendly performances, it's reasonable to say that this matinee version is not one.", "Exactly!", "Not a toddler, surely. 5 years at least would be appropriate in my opinion for Nutcracker.", "I agree that The Nutcracker is a little different. It's usually most children's introduction to the ballet and classical music. So I would expect children at a performance, but I still hope for the children to behave.", "Maybe, but tickets were also $50 and it was a weekend matinee of a children\u2019s ballet, and apparently nobody (including ushers) except OP had a problem with the child\u2019s behavior, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this performance was more child-friendly than OP thinks.\n\nETA: if it was the Tallahassee Ballet production, they market the show with this copy: \u201cGenerations of families mark the holiday season by dressing up and introducing bright-eyed youngsters to the most frequently performed ballet in America and worldwide.\u201d", "[deleted]", "Do you know how to read usernames? Also the avatar is totally different too, plus I have a flair and they don\u2019t\u2026 Come on", "I just want to say, as someone who lives in NYC, you should be thankful that you think $50 tickets aren\u2019t cheap. Go take a look at the prices to see The Nutcracker at Lincoln Center.", "ESH\n\nThe Nutcracker, if a matinee, is considered extremely child-friendly. Expect noise.", "Nta, kids need to learn to sit quietly and watch a play or a movie. I took my kids to almost empty theatres or special times for kids so that they could learn etiquette.", "100% NTA\n\nThe same thing happened to me yesterday during a ballet performance of Romeo and Juliet (who tf takes their 5 and 3yo to Romeo and Juliet?) I had a bad feeling from the beginning and sure enough there was babbling constantly and I had the back of my seat kicked every 2 minutes at minimum. \nI turned around every time that happened. It took me out of the performance and I was so angry. Luckily for me they seemed to get the message and left after the 1st act. \n\nI\u2018m all for children getting to experience live performances - once they\u2018re old enough to not disturb others or in an appropriate child friendly setting. \n\nActually I need to rant a little\u2026\nDuring that same performance my seat neighbor (a fully grown adult) checked her phone constantly, with her phone on full brightness and last week while attending a musical theatre performance the two ladies next to me started talking (no hushed voices) every time the music started to fade and during speaking breaks. I hate confrontation but after 10 minutes I\u2018ve had enough and told them to be quiet please. I didn\u2019t say anything to my other neighbor who pointed at things constantly with a fully outstretched arm to make his girlfriend aware of stuff happening, but I wish I had . Full on his arm in front of my face during a live performance\u2026\n\nI feel like in addition to a reminder that no photos, videos and audio recordings are allowed during live performances, there should be a reminder to actually behave and not mess with other people\u2018s enjoyment of the show. \nWe\u2018re all paying 50,100,150\u20ac per ticket here - I expect you to be able to sit still and shut your mouth for 120 minutes and just take it all in, PLEASE. \n\nRant over. I do feel better now.", "NTA. Good on you for confronting her. There are certain expectations in society and it is ok to enforce them. While it seems like your confrontation had no effect on her, it may linger in the back of her head for a long time.", "I like the nutcracker.  I've experienced this.  And it's so expensive just to go.", "\"more talented performers in more expensive city cost more to see\", more at 11.", "You're awfully elitist for someone who spends enough time here to have 17 points", "That's needlessly condescending. I personally like Christmas traditions, ballet, and Tchaikovsky, but regardless I would be annoyed if I paid $100 for my partner and I to see anything and a parent allowed their child to be this disruptive during the show.", "You can\u2019t compare Tosca with a ballet like The Nutcracker; it is basically made for kids - of course kids will be there, especially during the afternoon show (just like H\u00e4nsel and Gretel for example).", "I think I\u2019ve been conditioned to expect bad behavior but you\u2019re right that that shouldn\u2019t be the case and doesn\u2019t excuse it.", "You\u2019re right - I wasn\u2019t reading \u201ctoddler\u201d in the literal sense (I was just thinking young kid) but I was likely mistaken.", "Damn I knew I should've made a throwaway. Gross.", "Yeah my wife works with kids and said they were an old 2, or young 3", "Yikes, no wonder it went badly! NTA and sorry for my poor reading comprehension.
