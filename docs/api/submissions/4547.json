People pay good money for these shows and then they are disrupted by kids and their parents do not care at all. The mother should be taken the kid out if they wont stop talking it's distracting to other people. Next time I highly suggest you tell an usher and they can talk to the mother for you. That's what they're there for and you don't need to get involved directly.", "NTA. These kinds of parents are literally the worst. I would have gotten my money back.", "NTA. Don't take your small children to a performance show if they can't keep quiet and disrupts the other guests. Or at the very least she could've left with her toddler for a few minutes until the kid calmed down.", "NTA! The parents who refuse to parent or have any kind of common courtesy for other people are the worst! The kinds that think they're entitled to let their children run amok while everyone else has to suffer is inconsiderate, selfish, rude & shouldn't be tolerated. People who think it's okay to disturb others and let their kids do the same do a disservice to everyone - including the kids who will grow up thinking they don't have to respect anyone because their parents allow them to encroach on & bother everyone else. Smh. Definitely NTA! The mother should have taken the kids out of the theater - that simple!", "NTA. Equivalent to taking a crying baby to movie theater. You know your kids, you know they'll be like that. So DON'T GO or hire a baby sitter. Why should other people suffer just so ONLY you can enjoy the show.", "NTA. Those people were AH to bring a kid that young to the show. It\u2019s horribly inconsiderate. Instead of leaving, I would have found an usher during intermission and ask it he could handle the situation so that everyone could enjoy the show they paid to see.", "NTA You take the toddler to the other show.  If you do take the toddler to this show and they are not quiet, you walk out with them.  Do people not do this anymore?", "NTA. Some theaters have a warning for noise people make and how children should be handled by their parents.", "NTA.  Well done for standing up to her.  You could have taken it up with the theatre, arguing that you were unable to enjoy the show; you'd probably get a partial refund, and more importantly, it would motivate the theatre to make it clear what behavior is expected.", "**NTA**\n\nBut the next time this goes on for more than a couple of minutes, go get an usher. It is their job to \"politely encourage\" disruptive people (or people with small, disruptive children) to leave the theatre until they (or their offspring) can stop disrupting the performance, which is also stressful for performers, who very much appreciate your tagging in and getting a staff member to deal with it.\n\nLet me be clear, BTW: I adore small children, and I believe there is a place for them in the theatre. And I will death-glare the first person who tries to chalk this up to \"maybe the child was neurodivergent\". Nope. I have worked with small children off and on for over 30 years. And I AM AUTISTIC, and my parents started taking me to the theatre when I was a toddler. They began with dedicated children's theatre, but I actually went to see The Nutcracker (coincidentally) at Canada's National Arts Centre theatre when I was 4 years old. My tiny autistic self behaved beautifully, I'm told. I was rapt. Well . . . okay, at intermission it's possible that I went out to the lobby and danced my little heart out, including my party dress somehow ending up over my head from all my tiny ballerina excitement, hahaha. But it seems that there was applause, so nothing disruptive. \n\nAnd the important point is this: it was made VERY CLEAR to me (as it always was on theatre outings) that once the lights came down in the theatre, my mouth was to stay shut, that it was a Very Special Privilege to be allowed to go to the theatre like a grownup, and see something so beautiful, and that if I couldn't be quiet and sit nicely (either in my seat or on my mum's lap), then I would have to leave. No fuss, but we couldn't stay either. Loud, fussy children aren't allowed to stay and disrupt other people's enjoyment. \n\nSmall children can absolutely be taken to the theatre - even to non-child-specific showings. But learning how to behave is, in fact, a learning process, and one that parents have to be willing to be actively involved in. And if they aren't willing to put in the work, then events where they are disruptive to others and to the performers who work SO HARD are probably not for their family.\n\nAll of which is a long way of saying: you are absolutely NTA, but in future please don't let anyone ruin it for you. The ushers and theatre staff are there to support your enjoyment of the show. Let them do that. They're usually stationed around the theatre for exactly that reason, so you can easily grab one and ask for their assistance.", "NTA. She was embarrassed because she was ruining the play for others.", "NTA, but next time talk to an usher.", "NTA.  And no, ppl don\u2019t do this anymore.  It\u2019s gross & pathetic.  For the price of theatre tickets you\u2019d think ppl could shut it but apparently their words cannot be postponed.", "NTA- who cares if it was passive aggressive\u2026 she obviously understood WHAT the issue was\u2026 she refused to take the toddler out of the theater until the child could calm down enough so that he/she was not disturbing others\u2026 that\u2019s on her\u2026 if she is going to allow her toddler to repeatedly cause a distraction.. then she should have to deal with being reminded that her toddler is causing the distraction (as an aside, I love children and 100% understand that sometimes children make noises or cry in a theatre and if it\u2019s a one off I have no issues with this, but if you go to a show with a child who cannot be quiet or continues to cry\u2026 how do you NOT take them out of the show until they calm down?!)", "NRA here, you have a reasonable expectation of quite.

These Ah ruin the performance for everyone around them. They turn the outing into a struggle.", "NTA. These Ah ruin the performance for everyone around them. They turn the outing into a struggle.", "ESH - This is something you should have spoken either to the parents or the ushers about at the interval.\n\nIf a small kid is bored and you keep (as far as they will understand it) playing peekaboo with them, then they\u2019re going to do it more. Especially when you\u2019ve established that the parents aren\u2019t going to do anything.\n\nI do think that being able to hear the show though is not an unreasonable expectation, unless it is a relaxed or kids\u2019 performance, which is obviously different altogether. Head ushers *may* be able to move you if the issue is not resolved by speaking to the other party, at their own discretion, if the show is not sold out.\n\nI also think throwing tots in at the deep end with a full length ballet (or play, or film) is a bit much to ask of them, and maybe they should have managed expectations or worked out a better way of communicating. I was a very inquisitive kid but I sat on my dad\u2019s knee and whispered questions in his ear if I had any. And I had about 156 in the first three minutes.\n\nAnd in this instance, taking the kid outside for a couple of minutes to answer their questions and to explain that she needs to whisper to her parents would have been fairer to everybody.\n\nBut I also do think that some element of audience noise comes with the territory of matinee shows. I went to the west end last week for a matinee and it was full of school parties and was pretty noisy. But that\u2019s why the tickets are cheaper in a matinee.", "NTA but let's be serious for a moment. Matinees of the Nutcracker are a family event.

It\u2019s like going to the movie theater to see a new cartoon or Disney on ice and complaining that kids were talking too loud. The price of seats is irrelevant - it\u2019s a child friendly event.", "*im not supporting the behavior*\n\nBut the Nutcracker is often seen as *children\u2019s ballet*.   Because it has so many children in the ballet and it\u2019s Christmas themed etc.  and most of the \u201cnutcracker\u201d movies and books are for children. \nAnd people may not be aware there\u2019s are special children performances if they don\u2019t know to look, thinking the whole thing is for kids. \n\nIt\u2019s like if your symphony does normal symphony stuff all year and then has a series of shows of all  Disney music, people will assume it\u2019s kid oriented and that kids being kids will be fine. \n\nIt\u2019s one of those society mash ups, that really messes with reality (like how people thought DNA tests took 30 minutes because of CSI). \n\nShe should have taken the kid out, but I\u2019m not surprised she thought it was a kid show.", "\"National Rifle Association here,..\"", ">continual turning around was a bit passive aggressive\n\n*\"Continual\"* turning around?

If I'm at a show that is not advertised as a family-specific show, I'd turn around (or summon an usher) after the kid was loud for a third time. Too many parents take their kids to inappropriate venues and inconvenience others instead of taking responsibility and removing the kid from the show. \n\nAt a family-specific show, I'd probably behave a little differently unless a child was being ostentatiously disruptive.", "> The Nutcracker itself is a family show.\n\nSo nobody should be allowed to enjoy it, and there's no etiquette anymore cool got it\n\nMore excuses for parents to not parent", "Yes it's a family show, so of course people should expect families there, but if a kid is being disruptive then the parent should do something about it.

They are very pretty and lovely to watch, but unless your local company has made a lot of changes, there isn't any actual plot happening there, and the characters introduced in the first half just kind of watch for most of act II. Especially for kids who are already struggling to understand what is happening without any dialogue, it's a slog.\n\nBut that's just the nature of the beast. It's marked as a great introductory ballet and fun for the whole family, so you sort of have to accept that there will be children and other people there who are not familiar with ballet and the expected norms, and who struggle to sit still and quiet for so long. Looking back once is one thing, but doing so repeatedly is just rude and unnecessary.
