Last Sunday, we went to their house for a visit and a dinner.\r  \n\r  \nAs we arrived, I greeted everyone warmly, including Eva. \n\nLauren casually mentioned that Eva touches people's faces to get a sense of what they look like. Before I knew it, Eva's hand being guided towards my face by Lauren. \n\nI backed away and politely said, \"Please don't touch my face.\"\r  \n\r  \nLauren took me into another room. It was then that she informed me that Eva had a habit of touching the faces of everyone she dated, but I was the first person to decline the gesture. \n\nI explained that I wasn't comfortable with someone I had just met touching my face, as it made me feel weird and invaded my personal space. \r  \n\r  \nLauren, however, seemed to take offense to my refusal. She argued that Eva's behavior was just a part of their family's dynamics and if I couldn't accept it, our relationship wouldn't work.\n\nI responded that while others might be fine with it, I had my boundaries and felt uneasy about the situation.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, I felt so overwhelmed by the whole ordeal that I decided to leave without saying goodbye to anyone. Lauren reached out to apologize later, but I stood my ground and made it clear that our relationship was over.\n\nLauren was supposed to stay with me in my apartment during summer classes, and she cannot now. She also was getting rides from me to work and I have blocked her number. I really am tired of friends reaching out to ask if everything is okay, because Lauren and I were friends for a few years before this happened. \n\nI have very strong boundaries with touch. I had family who refused to accept no when it came to hugs. It isn't anything I consider unforgivable, but I make it really clear with people when I say no to something it is not up for argument, if it involves touch.

It would have made me extremely uncomfortable if a stranger touching my face was just sprung on me and I would have politely declined. \n\nI\u2019m sure Eva would have completely understood if anyone had bothered to give her a heads up ahead of time.", "I find this story rather suspect, as the whole 'touching faces' is mainly made up by Hollywood.

So maybe she shouldn't throw out ultimatums about ending their entire relationship over a personal physical boundary that she knew beforehand existed? \n\nNTA \n\nLauren put her sister in a very awkward situation when she knew OP had a boundary over touch. It sounds like Lauren expected OP to back down in this situation because her sister is blind. \n\nMisty, you're way better off without Lauren.

Good for you for standing your ground. Touching someone\u2019s face is intimate, maybe once you had developed more of a relationship with her and she actually asked then you could be seen as a bit insensitive to flat out refuse but I still don\u2019t think you\u2019d be TA.", "NTA - but this definitely could have been handled better.

You are not required to let a stranger touch your face. The situation could\u2019ve been handled better but she was in no position to demand you to do anything and give you an ultimatum. People who give ultimatums to get their way rather than talk probably isn\u2019t someone you want to be with.", "Nta all though many people who prefer not to be touched would be ok with this situation being an exception but it\u2019s ok if you are not ok with it.\n\nBoundaries are ok to have. It\u2019s your body", "Nope, NTA. People are allowed to have their personal boundaries and they should be respected. Your ex not only tried to pressure you, it sounds like she basically was giving an ultimatum.  Major red flag. No means No. Period.\n\nPlus, we are so much more than how our faces just happen to look/feel. None of one's facial features have any bearing  on who they are on the inside which is what really counts when getting to know and bonding meaningfully with others.\n\nI know several legally blind people and one person who was born fully blind. None of them have ever expected or demanded to touch my face and we have always worked and communicated well together. My facial characteristics aren't relevant to them and it doesn't impede them to instead just hear descriptions and recognize my voice and verbal inflections.\n\nIt's not being ableist to expect everyone to respect your bodily autonomy. It doesn't mean you feel you are superior to anyone with a disability, think they need to be fixed or discriminate against them.\n\nIn fact, one could argue that its ableist for others to assume and expect everyone will be comfortable with physical touch (with no prior heads up even),  when they don't even know what severe sensitivities, past experiences or traumas such as abuse or perhaps neurodivergence might be at play -yet your ex judged, and coerced you. Not to mention, it's not very hygienic so those with compromised immune systems who would also potentially be at risk from hand to face contact.\n\nNot that you, OP, even need such reasons to explain or justify your stance regardless. Denying people bodily boundaries is disrespectful, detrimental and dangerous.", "Nta\n\nNo one has the right to touch you after you say no, her sister didnt NEED to know what your face looks like", "NTA. She should have asked first.", "NTA - \"no means no\", period.  This isn't negotiable.", "NTA. Nobody is ever entitled to touch you without your consent.", "NTA and ending it was for the best. If her family dynamic means you have to deal with something you aren't ok with, that relationship wouldn't work. \nThis is a compatibility issue. \n\nLauren should have discussed the touching prior. Even if she didn't know how you feel about touching, that's still a discussion.", "NTA. Those are your boundaries and you\u2019re allowed to have them. Especially when it comes to physical touch.", "NTA\n\nBoundaries are boundaries for a reason.

Saying you were uncomfortable should have been enough. Sorry that happened OP", "NTA", "INFO: what did Eva have to say? It seems really weird that a thirty year old would not have more of her own agency in this and would also have her own sense of boundaries in not touching strangers? In thirty years you\u2019re not the first person to be like, woah, hang on, especially if her family drags her hand-first into peoples faces on the regular.", "INFO: I\u2019m wondering, would time spent getting to know Eva, before her then asking permission to touch your face, change your answer?\n\nHonestly, the info doesn\u2019t change mine. NTA. This was a failure of Lauren to properly communicate your boundaries to her family and to accept your boundaries, but I am curious if there could have been a path forward if communication had been better.", "NTA. \n\nShe threatened the viability of the relationship if you refused to change your boundaries on unwanted touching. You responded by ending the relationship, taking the power away from her when her emotional blackmail would not work on you. Good outcome.", "NTA, you were clear about your boundaries and they should be respected. By trying to force it on you, they only solidified why you have that hard no in place.\n\nGood job for standing your ground.", "Nta", "I'd say YTA for not appreciating the difference at hand. A blind person touching you to try to figure out what you look like isn't the same as... well, literally any other situation where a sighted person would be doing it. \n\n> In the end, I felt so overwhelmed by the whole ordeal that I decided to leave without saying goodbye to anyone.
