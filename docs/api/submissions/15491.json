This is the same for my sister and her boyfriend too (who live across the country). \n\nThis is a cousin which I don\u2019t see all too often, typically once or twice a year, meaning although him and his partner have met my girlfriend it hasn\u2019t been all too frequent. I understand that weddings can be very expensive which is a completely fair and valid point, and have heard that this wedding itself is costing a lot of money (in excess of \u00a325k). I\u2019ve heard that each attendee is costing around \u00a3100 each, which is not insubstantial, but I have been quite confused as to the straight out declining of any evening attendees (which I thought was fairly normal for a wedding as well as not costing a penny?). This of course meaning that for the entire ceremony partners of many people will not be there. \n\nI think this has caused issue across the board, with my aunties brother not attending for the same reason, as well as my sister not making it because of the commute needed just to attend a wedding without her partner. My other aunty and uncle have been invited (no relation to the groom/bride) who were quite confused to as to why they were invited but not partners of the cousins as well. \n\nAs of right now, I am currently making my decision on if I am to attend. My initial gut feeling throughout this is to decline, but i\u2019m wondering if i\u2019m being an asshole because of this. I would understand if this was a relatively new relationship I was in, but I have been in this relationship for 4 years now.

It is your choice to go or not. Regardless of any choice you make, it's fine imo. They are also not AH for not wanting to invite partners. It's their wedding, their call who they want to invite. \n\nI personally would still go even if I had a partner. I personally don't expect my partner to be invited to everything I am invited to, especially in terms on extended family.\nBut that's just my opinion. It's just few hours anyways", "NAH  They may well be trying to stick to a budget, and that means minimising the invites of people they don't know well, in favour of their friends who they want there. That is entirely up to them.\n\nThere is no obligation for you to attend at all, if you are not comfortable doing so without your partner, or because of cost staying over etc.\n\nIn answer to your question about evening guests, there normally is a cost for people who come to the evening do in the UK, after the main day wedding reception. People normally pay for catering for food for evening guests as well, and whilst it may be a buffet that caters to 2/3 the number of guests, as a lot of the day guests will already have eaten, there is still a cost.", "NAH\n\nYour cousin is not an asshole for limiting \u201cplus ones\u201d as long as everyone is treated equally. The only rule is that both halves of a married couple need to be invited, barring extreme circumstances.\n\nBut you\u2019re also not an asshole for not wanting to attend an hours-long party with no one to dance with except your sister.

No one\u2019s wrong in this situation, I\u2019d suggest doing what you feel is best for you and your partner. Declining an invitation to something isn\u2019t rude (unless you wait til the last minute). Inviting only family members and not their partners isn\u2019t rude, either. It\u2019s their wedding, their dime, their choice. \n\nThat being said, I have social anxiety and wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable attending an hours-long event without my partner, mostly for the sake of comfort because my family events can be more stressful than enjoyable.", "NAH you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole for declining, even for family there\u2019s no one\u2019s wedding you have to go to if you don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t feel comfortable. Your cousin is also not the asshole for limiting plus ones, it\u2019s already going to cost a lot of money so inviting the partners of cousins they only see once or twice a year wouldn\u2019t be a priority and that\u2019s understandable", "The bride and groom can invite who they want, and they have to make the calculations on who they can afford, who they 'have' to invite etc.\n\nYou aren't very close to your cousin.\n\nInviting you together = 200\u00a3\n\nInviting you alone = 100\u00a3\n\nYou not coming as your partner wasn't invited = 0\u00a3\n\nThey politely invited you. You politely declined.\n\nSame for your sister.\n\nNo harm done, the family status quo preserved.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI am firm believer that only inviting one half of an established couple is a breach of social etiquette, a faux pas, it's *rude*. \n\nIf they can't afford to feed two people, they need to invite neither or get cheaper catering.", "NAH you are not close to the bride and groom and there are a lot of other factors besides money when it comes to a wedding.

You really can\u2019t spend one afternoon away from your girlfriend?", "What is up with everybody acting like they can\u2019t go anywhere without their SO?", "NAH\n\nThey are only inviting married couples. It\u2019s never rude to decline a wedding invite. Send your regrets & move on. It\u2019s not personal, it\u2019s financial.\n\neta \u2014 as an event planner I will add \u2014 It\u2019s actually fairly typical for people with very large families not to include +1 for unmarried couples. The main reason is the cost can get out of control but often they just want it to be an event where \u201cfamily\u201d all know each other & prefer not to have random people attend. \n\nIn this case, you are in a long term relationship however that may not be the case for all your relatives.
