He has 46 or 47 cousins\u2026..this is just aunts/uncles/cousins.

Plenty of people go to weddings alone.", "It tends to be a cascading thing in the UK so I've seen smallish ceremonies, followed by the 'wedding breakfast', then a sort of cocktail/photo event (more people come along) and then finally a dance reception/buffet (more people again).

Doubtless some relatives would be butt-hurt about it but the hell with them.", "It doesn't seem your cousin is slighting your gf, so I'd say go, if you cae enough for your cousin to be cherishing him on his wedding day. Couples do not need to do everything together. The reason he's limiting attendance is valid", "NAH, you said you guys aren\u2019t particularly close, so why would he spend the money on someone he barely knows? Because of this, it is fine to not go, but you will cross into AH territory if you make it about you", "NAH\n\nThey get to invite who they want.  You get to attend or not attend for pretty much any reason you want.\n\nIf you don't want to go without GF, don't go.", "Need more info:\n\nAre they not invited SPECIFICALLY because of cost, or is there another underlying reason?

Now if someone invited me but not my spouse, that's definitely a slap in the face and I am not going.", "NAH. Not going is the best solution - I\u2019d probably go without, but it\u2019s your choice. They\u2019re not in the wrong for keeping the invites to family/close people only", "NAH, it was polite of them to invite you although you\u2019re not very close. But I can see why they\u2019re keeping their guest list smaller. It\u2019s not impolite of you to not attend at all. You\u2019re not that close after all.

It's an invitation, not a summons. If you don't want to go, don't go.", "NAH - it's up to you whether you want to go. However, I get that they did it due to cost and you can still go by yourself and have fun and support your cousin. If you don't, just prepare yourself for the awkwardness if they ask why.", "They absolutely are assholes for excluding guests\u2019 partners.", "Eh, I wouldn't want to go to some family events alone either. With my mum's side it's all good, I know nearly everybody. With my dad's side, however, I'd prefer to have the option of a plus one. There is a ton of them (grandma had 10 siblings, grandpa 4), we lived far apart my entire life so I hardly know most of them and I fall very weirdly into the generational age brackets, were I'm either a lot younger or a lot older than my cousins and second cousins. At least those I know lmao", ">but if I were you cousin I would be disappointed that someone experiences spending time with me and my loved ones such a chore that they can\u2019t do it without their partner\n\nDo you realize how much time people outside the wedding party actually spend with the bride and groom at a wedding is not all that much? The reason that it's traditional to give people plus ones at weddings is because the bride and groom have so much going on that they can't entertain every single guest all night. If you're having a wedding with 100 people, and the reception is going to be five hours, that leaves you with three minutes of time per person, without breathing room to go do things they themselves enjoy like dancing. I'm not saying the bride and groom as assholes for not allowing plus ones, but the idea that someone not wanting to come without a plus one \"finds spending time with (the bride or groom) such a chore\" is quite the mischaracterization. Weddings are long events where the guests spend most of their time \"hanging out\" with each other, the only people really \"spending time\" with the bride and groom are the bridal party.", "Personally, I find the best rule of thumb for \"plus one\" invitations is \"who is this person close to that is already invited?\" If you can't really think of even one person that you know they would enjoy spending hours on end with, give them a plus one. Your cousin who's got a bunch of relatives they know and care about also attending might not need a plus one... your one work friend who's never met anyone else that you're inviting should get one.", "It's almost certainly a pricing/number of people thing. Weddings are EXPENSIVE and every person you add to the guest list can add hundreds of dollars by the end of it. \"No +1 without being engaged/married\" is a pretty common rule.", "I agree with you in case of a friend who doesn\u2019t know anyone else at the wedding, but OP\u2019s entire family is going to be there.", "umm.. yeah.. pretty sure that would definitely make you the asshole.  ;-)", "But who is the asshole for OP not attending a wedding?", "No need to downvote. I already edited my post to NAH a couple of hours ago.\n\nOr down vote if it makes you feel good.", "The reception", "I already edited to NAH a couple of hours ago", "The way I absolutely cackled at your response", "NAH. Unless you\u2019re immediate family, you can decline a wedding invitation for any reason or no reason.", "I don't think anyone is ever an asshole for not going to someone's wedding. In fact, you'll be saving them some money, so it's almost a favor.\n\nBut I also don't think the couple is obligated to invite everyone's partners, as long as they're applying their rules evenly \u2014 and it does seem like they're differentiating between married and unmarried partners in this case.\n\nNAH. Go or don't go. It's fine either way.", "NTA", "NTA. It's an invitation, not a summons.

It is what it is", "Right! If I\u2019m with someone and they are not invited, imma just say okay because not everything is about me. Unless they\u2019re singling the partner out purposely, sometimes we gotta say okay and move along. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated.", "Yeah, girlfriend isnt a wife. You cant declare someone an AH just because they dont want to include someones girlfriend to their wedding.\nA couple can choose to live together for how long they want and \u0131ts their choice.

Both legally and socially.", "My controveral opinion on this is\nIf you have a girl/boy friend that you have been dating to who cares how much time, its YOUR girl/boyfriend\nBut if you have a husband/wife, that becomes MY extended family.", "Nah but you could maybe ask if you could pay for your partner to join if it\u2019s an issue of money? Either way it sounds like they may only be inviting partners by marriage (maybe to cut costs maybe for other reasons). I personally would still go solo if I knew enough people attending but if it\u2019s a matter of cost you could offer to pay your gfs way!", "It's their decision who to invite to their wedding and allow a plus 1 would double the cost.\n\nDon't take it personally, go to the wedding your cousins were kind enough to invite you to.", "YWNBTA to RSVP no to the wedding invite.

That's the point of marriage", "Yes, but this couple is already spending \u00a325,000 on their wedding. Given that, I think it's pretty understandable that they don't want to spend more to include other halves.\n\nAlthough I will say, if they're spending that much without giving unmarried relatives \ufffca plus one, I have a really hard time understanding how exactly they're filling up their guest list.", "Ikr?  I always felt sorry for people like that - they end up without close friendships or familial relationships because they refuse to put in effort for any relationship that isn't their S/O.", "Again, four years is longer than lots of marriages last."]}
