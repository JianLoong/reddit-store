I understand that weddings can be very expensive which is a completely fair and valid point, and have heard that this wedding itself is costing a lot of money (in excess of \u00a325k). I\u2019ve heard that each attendee is costing around \u00a3100 each, which is not insubstantial, but I have been quite confused as to the straight out declining of any evening attendees (which I thought was fairly normal for a wedding as well as not costing a penny?). This of course meaning that for the entire ceremony partners of many people will not be there. \n\nI think this has caused issue across the board, with my aunties brother not attending for the same reason, as well as my sister not making it because of the commute needed just to attend a wedding without her partner. My other aunty and uncle have been invited (no relation to the groom/bride) who were quite confused to as to why they were invited but not partners of the cousins as well. \n\nAs of right now, I am currently making my decision on if I am to attend.

It's their wedding, their call who they want to invite. \n\nI personally would still go even if I had a partner. I personally don't expect my partner to be invited to everything I am invited to, especially in terms of extended family.\nBut that's just my opinion. It's just few hours anyways", "NAH  They may well be trying to stick to a budget, and that means minimising the invites of people they don't know well, in favour of their friends who they want there. That is entirely up to them.\n\nThere is no obligation for you to attend at all, if you are not comfortable doing so without your partner, or because of cost staying over etc.\n\nIn answer to your question about evening guests, there normally is a cost for people who come to the evening do in the UK, after the main day wedding reception. People normally pay for catering for food for evening guests as well, and whilst it may be a buffet that caters to 2/3 the number of guests, as a lot of the day guests will already have eaten, there is still a cost.", "NAH\n\nYour cousin is not an asshole for limiting \u201cplus ones\u201d as long as everyone is treated equally.

No one\u2019s wrong in this situation, I\u2019d suggest doing what you feel is best for you and your partner.

It\u2019s their wedding, their dime, their choice. \n\nThat being said, I have social anxiety and wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable attending an hours-long event without my partner, mostly for the sake of comfort because my family events can be more stressful than enjoyable.", "NAH you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole for declining, even for family there\u2019s no one\u2019s wedding you have to go to if you don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t feel comfortable. Your cousin is also not the asshole for limiting plus ones, it\u2019s already going to cost a lot of money so inviting the partners of cousins they only see once or twice a year wouldn\u2019t be a priority and that\u2019s understandable", "The bride and groom can invite who they want, and they have to make the calculations on who they can afford, who they 'have' to invite etc.\n\nYou aren't very close to your cousin.\n\nInviting you together = 200\u00a3\n\nInviting you alone = 100\u00a3\n\nYou not coming as your partner wasn't invited = 0\u00a3\n\nThey politely invited you.

Because I asked if they were okay for bringing up clinical anxiety and insta-downvoting everything I said?
