Your mother is a thief. Go ahead and set up a camera. Once you catch her, tell her next time you will contact authorities. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Get a safe and bolt it to the floor of your closet. It will be impossible for her to move or open it without significant damage. You get a hotel room sized one that opens with a combination.

Do your mother provides for you or is it just child support/your dad paying all the bills? \n\nIf you have any change to go out of this situation without ending in foster care or on the streat, try to do it. Maybe get a security camera or contact a lawer, if you have any profe of he rtaking your money, you and your brother might be able to sue her so she has to pay you back (if it is a larger number of cash - lika any heritage or collage funds)\n\nYou could start a secret bank account or if possible saving account. If you are underage, maybe you will need your grandparents to sign for it. there you could keep your money. \n\nIf you don't want your mother to get suspicious you might still keep a few bucks in your wallet so she will take this and not look for higher summs. And here you could also use the security camera.", "Nta", "You obviously already have a bank account as you have a debit card. Change the pin on the debit card.

Keep most of  your money in your bank account and buy a safe with a good lock to store your wallet with your cards, identification and extra cash--a decent one where she can't pick the lock.

Have an addiction problem?", "NTA. Get a fireproof lockbox - they're not expensive. Put your documents, including your wallet in there, when you come home, lock it. Keep the key with you.

Sure there is a limit without a passcode, but it\u2019s still big. \nSo like unless someone makes a payment over that limit they can do it multiple times.", "I'm in my 20's and yes I can.

Also, why don't you have an account at a bank or credit union? Assuming you are in a country where the age of maturity is 18, you won't need your parent to sign any forms.\n\nAlso, assuming you live in a country that has direct deposit, you can have your place of business just automatically deposit your money in the account.  DO NOT get a debit card, only use an ATM card and don't tell her the PIN number.", "No parent wants to ask there children for help.

Reimbursing you for raising me ? What about my driving licence ? What about my car ? What about my siblings who paid nothing ?\"\n\nA few months later, I got a job in the closest big city and moved as soon as I could and never got asked more money for personal expenses.\n\nIn short : NTA. If parents expect a \"return on investment\" from their kids, they definitely should reconsider the reason why they wanted to become parents.", "Use banks? Buy a safe? Shouldn\u2019t be impossible.", "NTA - this depends on your age and what we'retalking about. Over 18 get a savings account and direct deposit. Money in your wallet - get a locking box and a cheap security camera from Amazon. I have Yi cameras and they work really well Your only other option is to simply keep your wallet with you at all times - confronting your mother is pointless", "NTA, can you stay with friends or other family until you can save enough for an apartment? Do you have a bank account?", "Hi there, open up a bank account with you being the only signer on the account. Then put your money in there every week or each paycheck. Only keep enough cash in your wallet that you need at the time and so you know just how much is in there in case any of it comes up missing. If she is known to be a thief, she would definitely steal from you any chance she gets. Be safe and be smart put your money in a bank that only you have access to ok sunshine xoxo", "Hi there again, you might also want to think about getting a safe deposit box at the bank where you can keep all your important documents like your id, social security card, and other important paperwork that way she has no access to it at all. She sounds like the kind of person who would use your social security card and open up bank accounts or credit cards and then ruin your credit while you were just trying to get it started. These are the best safety measures I can recommend ok sunshine xoxo", "Keep it in a bank. Can\u2019t steal what\u2019s not in the house/home/apartment/shoe box", "Ngl even though I know this is serious but I laughed at cash cow. Get a lock box", "NTA - you heard of a bank account? Why do you have cash laying around?", "NTA.  She likely has your SS memorized or has it on old tax forms somewhere. I would see if you can apply for a new number or look into one of those identity fraud protection programs that alert you if someone tries to open a credit card in your name.  I've seen parents open new utility bills in kids name when theirs gets shut off, and getting credit cards, etc \n\nDef open a p.o box for your mail too.", "Get a bank account ASAP, one that only you have access to so she can't get her greedy hands on it.  And when you've saved up enough move far away from her and her long fingers! \n\nThere's nothing worse than working and saving money than having anyone, let alone your own mother, steal what's yours!  I feel slapping her repeatedly for you and your sib.  Should I get in line for that?  Because I know what it's like when someone steals your money.\n\nCan you and your brother maybe rent a small storage unit somewhere nearby, to store your stuff and tell the employees there that your mother steals, and to keep an eye out for her on their security cameras?  And this way you and your brother can keep your valuables safe and away from her, even if it's just the small stuff.  Most storage units also have security cameras.\n\nOh, and check on Amazon if they have small hidden/security cameras, so that if she's caught you can and should call the police and press charges, she needs consequences.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't carry cash because she'll take that immediately.", "If you do nothing else, lock down your credit NOW.   If she has had access to your social security number and/or has it memorized and has used it to her own benefit, it could seriously affect your future--from obtaining credit for yourself, getting your own place, and even getting certain jobs.   The concerning thing is that her own parent admit that she's been thieving since you and your brother were kids which leads one to strongly believe that she's probably abused the access to your social security number(s) at one point or another.  \n\nTry to remove yourself from the family home sooner rather than later and continue to hide your wallet from your mom even if you have to put it into a waterproof container or baggie whenever you bathe and strap it to your ass in all other situation when she's around.", "Have you confronted her?  Why not get a checking account?  \n\nI like WYZE security cameras.  Just be sure to unplug it when you're in your room.", "NTA.\n\nDo they make dye packs small enough for wallets? \n\nOr perhaps you could empty your wallet of real cash and get some realistic looking prop money for her to steal. She wouldn\u2019t be able to yell at you for embarrassing her when she tried to pay with fake money without admitting to theft.", "Man that's wild. I want to save as much money as I can to get a car and my own place", "Smart. If you sleep with it she'll have a much harder time finding/getting it without waking you up!", "Consider another place to live or else she will be looking to take from you at any opportunity.", "I got a pretty cheap small fire-proof one on Amazon for my important documents.", "You have a point. But, not paying rent makes it easier for her to justify liberating his money."]}
