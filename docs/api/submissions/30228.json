My brother found out from her parents that she's been a thief since we were kids. I don't know what to do or where to hide the money. No matter where I hide it, she finds it.\n\nI've been so paranoid that I had to hide my ID, social security card, and debit card from her! I am planning on getting a security camera because of how often this happens.

Are you out of school and working FT?  It would be fair for her to ask for rent, but everyone should be honest.", "NTA\n\nYou're over 18.  Get a bank account that is in only your name, put your money in the bank and don't keep cash in the house.", "NTA\n\nHow old are you? Can you get a bank account on your own? Safety deposit box? Your mother is a thief. Go ahead and set up a camera. Once you catch her, tell her next time you will contact authorities. \n\nGood luck OP.", "Get a safe and bolt it to the floor of your closet. It will be impossible for her to move or open it without significant damage. You get a hotel room sized one that opens with a combination. That will keep your belongings secure when you\u2019re at home. Getting a camera may help prove she\u2019s stealing but won\u2019t stop her doing it.", "So why are you posting advice instead of being judged. Put this in r/advice but use banks and save money to get your own place", "INFO: do you have anywhere else, where you can live? Do your mother provides for you or is it just child support/your dad paying all the bills? \n\nIf you have any change to go out of this situation without ending in foster care or on the streat, try to do it. Maybe get a security camera or contact a lawer, if you have any profe of he rtaking your money, you and your brother might be able to sue her so she has to pay you back (if it is a larger number of cash - lika any heritage or collage funds)\n\nYou could start a secret bank account or if possible saving account. If you are underage, maybe you will need your grandparents to sign for it. there you could keep your money. \n\nIf you don't want your mother to get suspicious you might still keep a few bucks in your wallet so she will take this and not look for higher summs. And here you could also use the security camera.", "Nta", "You obviously already have a bank account as you have a debit card. Change the pin on the debit card. Go to the bank and open a separate savings account that cannot be accessed using the debit card and ask for online statements not posted so there is no mail coming to the house to alert her. NTA", "NTA. Keep most of  your money in your bank account and buy a safe with a good lock to store your wallet with your cards, identification and extra cash--a decent one where she can't pick the lock. They're not very expensive. Problem solved. Then get your own place when you can afford it.", "How old are you? If you are 18 threaten to call the police. If you aren\u2019t tell another adult what\u2019s going on. My 16 year old nephew had his mother stealing his debit card and using it. She stole $200 and has stolen cash. Once he finally got the courage to tell me, I made her pay back every damn cent and told her I\u2019d file a report if it happened again. \n\nIt never happened again.", "You seek advice. There is nothing to judge about.", "Sorry she doesn't ask for help but must be struggling so takes some your an adult offer some money to help grow up help with the bills yes it's wrong to take but maybe if you helped and didn't just live rent free should would not have to.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Have an addiction problem?", "NTA. Get a fireproof lockbox - they're not expensive. Put your documents, including your wallet in there, when you come home, lock it. Keep the key with you.  Or get one with a thumb lock. She can find the box, but she won't be able to open it.", "It\u2019s 2023. Just use Apple Pay (digital payment) for pretty much everything. \n\nMy bank app allows me to turn certain features on and off as security measures. Does yours?\n\ne.g.  cash out at ATMs, card payments in-person, card purchase over the internet (domestic), card purchase over the net (international sites), Apple Pay, purchases with card while overseas, etc etc. It\u2019s great.

You can deposit your money and use a debit card in your name with your PIN so that you aren't always short of funds because your mom spends your money as fast as you can earn it, that way? NTA.", "NTA. That sounds absolutely insane.\nI recommend TP-Link Tapo C200. I've got it myself. It's motion activated and works in the dark too. It can pan and tilt to follow the movement that triggered it. It's also super cheap.", "A bank?", "I'm over the age of 18 and no longer in school. She doesn't ask for rent", "That's true I'm even afraid of having my wallet on my counter. I've had to hide it in my pj pockets every night", "I also suggest either Apple Pay of Google pay? Thingy. \nAnyhow without passcode or face even should she steal the phone she won\u2019t be able to pay.\nBecause idk about other countries but here we can touch the card to the card reader and pay. Sure there is a limit without a passcode, but it\u2019s still big. \nSo like unless someone makes a payment over that limit they can do it multiple times.", "I'm in my 20's and yes I can.

Also, why don't you have an account at a bank or credit union? Assuming you are in a country where the age of maturity is 18, you won't need your parent to sign any forms.\n\nAlso, assuming you live in a country that has direct deposit, you can have your place of business just automatically deposit your money in the account.  DO NOT get a debit card, only use an ATM card and don't tell her the PIN number.", "No parent wants to ask there children for help.
