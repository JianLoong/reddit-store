Why would you have to bathe with two twelve year old girls as a 14 year old male? Hell, she could've just sprayed you with a hose and that would've been way less awkward. Or even a bucket of water and a sponge or rag, if the issue was water conservation. \n\nIf you were under 10, I'd understand. But a 14 year old boy doesnt need to take baths with preteen girls. Thats creepy to me. And when I was a 12 year old girl, theres no way in hell I was going to bathe with an older boy, even in a bathing suit. \n\nNTA, but I think you and your mom need to sit down and have a discussion about this. Or even try talking to a family counselor.\n\nETA- OP said in a comment that he wasn't wearing a swimsuit in the bath. That's even worse for me, tbh. Imagine if the roles were reversed and it was a fully naked girl in front of two boys. Everyone would be saying NTA and tearing the mom to shreds. Why is it so different because hes a boy?\n\nMy vote is an even stronger NTA. But you still need to have a deep convo with your mom about this.", "NTA- it seems extremely inappropriate that your mother would have you \n, at 14 be naked and forced to bathe with younger children of the opposite sex. Regardless of your mothers reasoning, it was highly inappropriate. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to hold a grudge against someone who should have had your best interest at heart and instead. She disregarded your wishes, your comfort, and privacy. As well as  forced you into an inappropriate situation.  Tell her what she did was wrong and inappropriate, and that you still are upset about it. She doesn\u2019t have to like it, or understand but she needs to respect that it has broken your trust in her.", "If it was out in a rural area it may be that your mother's friend was trying to conserve water. This still sounds ducked up however because why would you put your daughters in a bath with a naked teenage boy.  So yeah I don't blame you in the least. NTA", "I'm having my FFF ( Fetishist Fanfiction Fuckery) triggered heavy here.", "OP=NTA (tho isn't the blame on the friend more than your mother?)\n\nIs this a cultural thing, because in the US that would be considered very inappropriate.\n\nA teen boy bathing with two teen(almost) girls.  BIG Nope", "This seems made up tbh. If it's true then you're obviously not the AH here. But it seems like a fantasy grade match rather than something that actually happened", "[deleted]", "NTA, the only part here that matters is that you said you were uncomfortable with the idea and she made you do it anyways.  She ignored your right to autonomy, boundaries, and comfort for no reason.  You have every right to be upset that, especially if she refuses to be an emotionally mature adult and rationally think about why it was wrong and give a genuine apology.", "This sounds rather made up to me. There was no road or driveway to the house, no walking path etc. You had to stroll across the field and fell in a bog. Come on now. At least make the story believable.", "Info: what sort of grudge are we talking? You refuse to talk to her and don\u2019t let her in your life, or you bring it up at family dinners and make her feel daft for such a silly oversight?", "YTA this sounds like you're blaming your mother for the actions of her friend.", "[deleted]", "I think cultural context has to come into play here. \n\nFrom your description of your journey, I'm guessing that you live in a very rural society that has fewer taboos around nudity, especially among children. And yes, 14 is still a child. \n\nHowever the girls did have bathing suits on and you did not so that kinda puts a question mark on that as well. \n\nNAH \n\nYou are not the AH for feeling uncomfortable. \n\nYour mother is not the AH for her cultural views on nudity among children. There was nothing sexual about the situation. \n\nHopefully your mother is currently respecting your personal boundaries and privacy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're right to be upset over this. You were 14 and were forced to bathe in front of two preteen girls.

But honestly, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Certainly not worth losing a relationship with a parent over. We\u2019re not debating her action, we\u2019re debating your response and I think cutting your Mum entirely from your life is not only ridiculous, but something you\u2019ll probably eventually regret.", "How is it not a big deal to force a boy to be naked in front of girls? My mother and the girls' mothers should have known it was wrong. I bet they would both think it is wrong if the roles were reversed and the girls were naked.", "I\u2019m not debating she did wrong. But what\u2019s your actual goal by shutting YOUR MUM out your life? Punishment for a single terrible judgement call? You\u2019ve done that and more now. What she did was wrong, embarrassing and frankly, ridiculous. Here\u2019s the thing though. Shit happens. If she made a habit of this then yeah, lock her out. But parents make mistakes and this was one of them. I\u2019d open communications with her. If she is totally unable to see what was wrong and takes it out on you, block her out. If she\u2019s sincerely apologetic then you can work on it. Nothing you can say though will convince me that outright removing her from your life with no chance at redemption is an asshole move, so don\u2019t bother.\n\nYou\u2019re 19 now, you think you know everything. Your ego is sky high and you\u2019ve come to get validation with a closed mind.  Trust me, I was 19. 10 years from now though you\u2019ll either be regretting cutting your Mum out from your life (possibly too late to correct!) or laughing about it having found a middle ground and built a relationship.", "Stop gaslighting OP. You sound insane. He\u2019s allowed to be upset and the person who wronged him being his mom doesn\u2019t change that. If anything, that\u2019s even more reason she should have had his back.", "I don\u2019t think you know what gaslighting means. Where am I questioning his reality or recollection?
