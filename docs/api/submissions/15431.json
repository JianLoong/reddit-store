Regardless of your mothers reasoning, it was highly inappropriate. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to hold a grudge against someone who should have had your best interest at heart and instead. She disregarded your wishes, your comfort, and privacy. As well as  forced you into an inappropriate situation.

You have every right to be upset that, especially if she refuses to be an emotionally mature adult and rationally think about why it was wrong and give a genuine apology.", "This sounds rather made up to me.

Would you say the same of the genders were flipped?", "Childish outrage? You've got to be kidding, right?  OP is absolutely justified in holding such a grudge, and the fact that his mother failed to see the issue with the situation is a whole problem in itself.", "YTA. She made a bad call, no doubt about it. She\u2019s definitely paid her price though, and then some.", "I don't think she did. She forced me to be naked in front of girls.", "I don't think so, either. You're right to be upset over this. You were 14 and were forced to bathe in front of two preteen girls. If the roles were reversed, and you were a naked girl in front of two boys, everyone would be freaking out and saying it was inappropriate and that she shouldn't have done that.", "It\u2019s too old, no doubt about it. But honestly, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Certainly not worth losing a relationship with a parent over. We\u2019re not debating her action, we\u2019re debating your response and I think cutting your Mum entirely from your life is not only ridiculous, but something you\u2019ll probably eventually regret.", "How is it not a big deal to force a boy to be naked in front of girls? My mother and the girls' mothers should have known it was wrong. I bet they would both think it is wrong if the roles were reversed and the girls were naked.", "I\u2019m not debating she did wrong. But what\u2019s your actual goal by shutting YOUR MUM out your life? Punishment for a single terrible judgement call? You\u2019ve done that and more now. What she did was wrong, embarrassing and frankly, ridiculous. Here\u2019s the thing though. Shit happens. If she made a habit of this then yeah, lock her out. But parents make mistakes and this was one of them. I\u2019d open communications with her. If she is totally unable to see what was wrong and takes it out on you, block her out. If she\u2019s sincerely apologetic then you can work on it. Nothing you can say though will convince me that outright removing her from your life with no chance at redemption is an asshole move, so don\u2019t bother.\n\nYou\u2019re 19 now, you think you know everything. Your ego is sky high and you\u2019ve come to get validation with a closed mind.

If a kid is saying they are not comfortable with being naked, it's their call. There are very few situations that it wouldn't be the case. NTA and your mom is a bit sick to think it's ok. I wonder if she would be OK with taking a bath with her friends husband. They are probably similar age. Ugh. Some people really don't get that even children deserve privacy and dignity.", "Fact or fiction who knows.", "NTA\nThis seems like it could be very traumatic for so many reasons. I\u2019m sorry thing happened to you!", "NTA.  I find it strange the adults in this scenario would insist adolescents bath together.  Boundaries, man.  For everyone.", "NTA. Your mother should have been protecting you, not allowing whatever this creepy plan was.", "You are NTA! But your mom and her friend definitely are. I was shocked when I read this. Who would force his teenage boy to bath with two girls?!", "NTA. Being forced to bathe naked with others when you don\u2019t want to is completely inappropriate at any age. If you are old enough to articulate that you need privacy then you should be given privacy.\n\nThe ages here push this beyond inappropriate into sexual abuse imo. I strongly recommend talking to someone about this. It was not ok. I\u2019m sorry that happened to you. You are not \u201cholding a grudge\u201d, you are still understandably upset about the inappropriate behaviour that was forced on you and it will be very hard to \u201clet this go\u201d as long as your mother (and her friend!) don\u2019t acknowledge their error. Personally I\u2019d even look into whether it is too late to report this. Are the 12yo s ok? Are the adults involved in a position of authority over young children? This is the sort of thing that people should know about.", "NTA. That's so fucking awkward for kids old enough to be going through puberty. I feel like that counts as some sort of sexual offense though I'm not sure what.", "This post is probably going to be removed for child s-xual abuse. NTA obviously, and I would suggest you get some trauma informed therapy to help process how unsafe, and without agency over your own body, your mother made you feel.", "NTA.  That's messed up.  Asking a pubescent boy to take a bath with two pubescent girls and having it not be weird shows an absolute failure to accept that you were a pubescent boy, which is probably what she still isn't accepting.  It was weird and she didn't respect your boundaries.", "At the very least they could have given you a bathing suit to cover up. That was messed up.", "NTA, I think 14 is way too old to be forced to bathe with anyone, regardless of gender.", "I completely agree that you are not the asshole here.

I changed my vote and all, but I want to make sure everyone sees that this was fake.", "So, yeah. This is probably fake then. For this poster, at least. But this probably did happen to someone else. Either way, it was a messed up thing. But if this didn't actually happen to you OP, then I'm ashamed of you, man.", "Lol, isn't that like parents job to protect the kid? She was right there, it's not like they kidnapped him. He allowed this to happen.", "My thing is that the risk of OP being accused of doing something, that would fall under the SA umbrella was a possibility. Being that he is male he is more likely to be seen as the abuser, rather than the victim. All around his mother was out of line.", "The only bath I took with male kids was when I was about 4 or 5. That seems a reasonable age (+/-) to start drawing boundaries --unless the whole culture is public bath and it would have been nothing new for anyone, though even there a single tub is more intimate.", "Eh people have bathed communally across epochs and cultures.\n\nI wouldn't be comfortable doing it but let's not act like it such a weird thing.", "[deleted]", "How the actual fuck are you able to write that out without falling over yourself laughing?\n\n>Also I'd recommend not saying \"I wish I grew up like you\" to perfect strangers as you don't know how they grew up.\n\nYou really *really* typed that after calling out *multiple* people saying there's no way this situation could happen and spouting bs points as if your fantasy scenarios encompass all of human experience? \n\nIt seems implausible that a real person could willingly present themselves so ridiculously and yet if you're not a troll guess what? It happened. Less likely things happen everyday i suppose. I dont even disagree that OP could be making it up - but plenty of things similar to it happen everyday.", "There's this thing called consent that she ignored as unnecessary where her son is concerned.  That's not an easily forgiven transgression and it has deeper meaning beyond the one incident because whatever fucked up mindset that led to that decision isn't necessarily gone even if time has passed."]}
