Racism, sexism, or other kinds of punching down are all excellent reasons for an anyone - audience or dinner guest - to talk back.\n\nWas this experience embarrassing for OP's date's friend? No doubt! And deservedly so. Hopefully she'll grow from this experience. \"Edginess\" was a shitty excuse for racism in comedy fifty years ago, and it has since aged like milk. Performing stand-up comedy also requires a pretty thick skin, so OP's date's pal better learn to get both less racist and less sensitive if she wants to make it! Meanwhile, your date needs a primer on intersectional feminism, because the idea that a woman should never push back on another woman's shitty behavior in order to be *feminist* is hilariously wrong and bad.

Yeah people will always accuse you of complaining or causing trouble as many commenters here are doing, but in my opinion the squeaky wheel gets the oil and social change doesn\u2019t happen if we don\u2019t say anything. Plus I don\u2019t get why people are acting like a public space is like a vacuum where you can just say whatever you want. Anyone can go to a comedy show and if a comedian chooses to make offensive jokes about a demographic and somebody in the audience is offended, the audience member is allowed to respond (I guess unless the club has rules that say otherwise).

That makes it about you.\n\nNow I dont think you're wrong for calling out the subject matter, but I do think you're wrong for when and how you did it. You aren't trying to teach in that moment, you're just scolding his friend. You chose to make it personal since there is a prior relationship between the comedian and your date. So what, he either backs you and white knights your ideal, or backs his friend, whom he supports enough to actually bring a date to their show?\n\nAnd the comedian's options are what?
