Pop culture has kind of commodified our existence and made it appealing in recent times but from a very young age my parents have instilled a strong sense of cultural identity in me.\n\n I recently went out on a third date with a guy who took me to a stand up gig where his friend was performing a set. \n\nThe set was actually going great and the friend (a woman) was truly funny. But then suddenly she made a couple digs at an ex from 2 years ago who is an Indian and made jokes about some really cringe stereotypes. For ex she joked about how the relationship fell apart due to miscommunication because of his accent. I audibly booed and said something along the lines of \"it's literally 2023 move on from your ex and casual racism\". A lot of people laughed and it visibly derailed her set because none of her later jokes landed. \n\nMy date was cold to me and then later texted \"it's really disappointing to me that as a feminist you could tear down another woman in public like that. I don't think it's going to work out for us.\" And blocked me. \n\nI turned to friends for perspective become idec about the dude but being called a bad feminist (=asshole) triggered me. And they kinda saw my point but also saw his. They said I would have definitely been introduced to her later on as they're friends and I could have taken it up with her then. Stand up comedy is already so male-dominated and misogynistic and I chose to humiliate this woman who was trying to be taken as seriously (heh) as her male counterparts. \n\nWhich. I get.

The joke was about how miscommunications ruin relationships and the punchline was about the Indian accent. There's no doubt it was racist because it was also preceded by two other jabs at Indians.\n\n2. I am not asking if I'm the asshole for not finding the racist joke funny. I'm asking if I'm the asshole for the way I reacted to it. So, please Reddit Racists take your cute lil opinions on what \"real comedy\" is elsewhere it's painful to watch.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI was contemplating reaching out to her on social media and explaining my stance and apologizing to her for embarrassing her. And now I'm definitely going to because wow the comments have shown me exactly the kind of audience stand-up comedy has. I hope she reacts positively and changes up her set. I want her to succeed without racist humor to show you clowns that it's doable and has been done!!!

Racism, sexism, or other kinds of punching down are all excellent reasons for an anyone - audience or dinner guest - to talk back.\n\nWas this experience embarrassing for OP's date's friend? No doubt! And deservedly so. Hopefully she'll grow from this experience. \"Edginess\" was a shitty excuse for racism in comedy fifty years ago, and it has since aged like milk. Performing stand-up comedy also requires a pretty thick skin, so OP's date's pal better learn to get both less racist and less sensitive if she wants to make it! Meanwhile, your date needs a primer on intersectional feminism, because the idea that a woman should never push back on another woman's shitty behavior in order to be *feminist* is hilariously wrong and bad.

Yeah people will always accuse you of complaining or causing trouble as many commenters here are doing, but in my opinion the squeaky wheel gets the oil and social change doesn\u2019t happen if we don\u2019t say anything. Plus I don\u2019t get why people are acting like a public space is like a vacuum where you can just say whatever you want. Anyone can go to a comedy show and if a comedian chooses to make offensive jokes about a demographic and somebody in the audience is offended, the audience member is allowed to respond (I guess unless the club has rules that say otherwise).

The obvious solution to me was to drop and get a new professor. New professor was a veteran high school teacher from the area, so no problems and that class wound up being very easy.  \n\n\nSome of the more smooth brained among us seem to think that was racist, even though it was my own problem with accents that caused it. I was not rude, I realized I was potentially being disruptive and dropped the class.

But it is okay for people in the repressed class to do accents, as long as they are \"punching up or across\" as we say in the comedy world - Stand Up Comedy as we know it today is literally founded in the Jewish tradition of mocking and parodying the ruling class during the Purim celebrations. \n\nThere is a grey area, on the other hand, of doing impressions of a specific *person's* accent. Especially when combined with a recognition or mockery of the person's other notable traits - like how everyone (a few notable exceptions) is generally okay with mocking Hitler by doing a bad German accent, putting on a fake mustache, and goose stepping. \n\nSo, with this comedian doing an accent that mocks her exboyfriend, who is a person of color (and we're assuming the comedian is a white woman), it is definitely a grey area - Indians, as relatively recent immigrants to the US, have a vastly different social standing than many other BIPOC in the US, and hold a different place in line of mockery than say, an Indian person in England where there is a different status for people of Indian descent. And he is a man, and it is incredibly clear that men are the oppressive group in the US over women. \n\nSo many would construe her using his accent and impression as her punching across, not down. While I wouldn't personally use an accent that is not my own on stage, I can understand the merit of using one, especially if the core of her joke hinges on the fact that processing accents can be difficult, and it would be nearly impossible for her to discuss the core of the problem without using his accent. \n\nSo yeah, while I wouldn't put her in the \"woke comedians of 2023\" showcase with the accent joke, I overall have fewer objections to her doing this joke specifically than I would have with a white man mocking a Black woman's accent. \n\nComedy is a matter of taste, and if we're going to allow exploration of all other topics through comedy, then this is one of those jokes that might use a crass display to speak to a deeper truth.", "The failure of the relationship isn't based just on an accent but how having separate native tongues could lead to miscommunication(theres likely a lot more to the deterioration of their relationship than just this).

I\u2019m sure as you know, french is widely spoken in Canada (especially in Quebec where\u2019s it\u2019s the primary language). Unlike French in Canada, Indian dialects are not common in the U.S. \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference you may ask? Canadians are not ridiculed the same way POC are for speaking English. The jokes for French Canadian accents are often set up through relative culture and experience - the punchline will land. The jokes for Indian Accents are set up by mocking an Indian persons ability to speak English."]}
