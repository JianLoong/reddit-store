When this was organised, the limit was put to a vote and instead of a cap, we decided on a minimum spend of $50. This was probably a bad idea.\r  \n\r  \nI have drawn my sister (F26). Some background on our relationship - it is not the best. Nothing has necessarily happened, we are just very different people and she really does not like the way that I am living my life. She said she cannot understand why I would want to \"tether\" myself to a man, or why I would bring \"another screaming gremlin\" into the world. Needless to say, I don't like these things being said about my family, so I don't engage with her very often. To be honest, I was surprised she wanted to come to ours for Christmas anyway, but I won't turn her away as long as she can be civil and not roll her eyes when the baby fusses.\r  \n\r  \nGiven my very tenuous relationship with my sister, I turned to my mom (F61) for some gift ideas. I don't want to spend a fortune, but I would like to get her something she wants/enjoys. Unfortunately, it seems my mom has gone directly to my sister and I am now getting texts from my sister with gift ideas that include exorbitantly expensive concert tickets, a hot air balloon experience, or, and this is not a joke, a cruise to Italy. Obviously, she doesn't just want one ticket as she would then be lonely at the concert/in the balloon/on the cruise - she would like two so she can take a friend.\r  \n\r  \nI was quite frustrated at my mom for telling my sister that I was her Secret Santa, and I also am now quite upset at the entitled attitude when it comes to gifts. I spoke to my mom about it, and she said that I am being unreasonable given that I can afford this, so I should pick the cheapest one on the list and bite the bullet, hopefully mending our relationship in the process.\r  \n\r  \nI told my mom that this was beyond ridiculous, but she said that money shouldn't matter when it comes to family and I should use this as something to bond over. I was a bit ticked, so I sent my sister a message saying that her gift ideas were far too extravagant and I will get her something reasonable.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister has now told the whole family that I am not keeping the spirit of Christmas alive, and she would like to boycott the celebrations. She is hosting a seperate dinner at her house for anyone who \"doesn't want to socialise with Scrooge\", and my mom is devestated that I am making her choose between her children on Christmas. Other family members are saying they don't want to get in the middle and would rather not go to either dinner. I feel like I have ruined Christmas and my son's birthday. Am I being the AH? Should I just buy the gift?", "created_utc": 1701137236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185kr3h/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_an_expensive_christmas/", "score": 777, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kiddo will enjoy the birthday and holiday more if you aren\u2019t stressing and are able to relax and enjoy it with him and husband.\n\nIf you\u2019d still like to host a family meal, let know you appreciate her taking on Christmas, and you\u2019d like to host something New Year\u2019s Eve or New Year\u2019s Day at your house.\n\nEdited: spelling and clarity were not my super power today. \ud83d\ude14", "So, if you don\u2019t live in Florida (i really hope you don\u2019t, bc then she\u2019d need to travel), in Orlando there\u2019s a hot air balloon at Disney Springs that\u2019s $25 a pop for adults. You could get her a reusable disney cup and make her think she\u2019s getting a Disney ticket when it\u2019s just the cup and a $25 hot air balloon ticket. \n\nhttps://www.aerophileorlando.com/", "Please let us know how you go.
