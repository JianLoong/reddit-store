When this was organised, the limit was put to a vote and instead of a cap, we decided on a minimum spend of $50. This was probably a bad idea.\r  \n\r  \nI have drawn my sister (F26). Some background on our relationship - it is not the best. Nothing has necessarily happened, we are just very different people and she really does not like the way that I am living my life. She said she cannot understand why I would want to \"tether\" myself to a man, or why I would bring \"another screaming gremlin\" into the world. Needless to say, I don't like these things being said about my family, so I don't engage with her very often. To be honest, I was surprised she wanted to come to ours for Christmas anyway, but I won't turn her away as long as she can be civil and not roll her eyes when the baby fusses.\r  \n\r  \nGiven my very tenuous relationship with my sister, I turned to my mom (F61) for some gift ideas. I don't want to spend a fortune, but I would like to get her something she wants/enjoys. Unfortunately, it seems my mom has gone directly to my sister and I am now getting texts from my sister with gift ideas that include exorbitantly expensive concert tickets, a hot air balloon experience, or, and this is not a joke, a cruise to Italy. Obviously, she doesn't just want one ticket as she would then be lonely at the concert/in the balloon/on the cruise - she would like two so she can take a friend.\r  \n\r  \nI was quite frustrated at my mom for telling my sister that I was her Secret Santa, and I also am now quite upset at the entitled attitude when it comes to gifts. I spoke to my mom about it, and she said that I am being unreasonable given that I can afford this, so I should pick the cheapest one on the list and bite the bullet, hopefully mending our relationship in the process.\r  \n\r  \nI told my mom that this was beyond ridiculous, but she said that money shouldn't matter when it comes to family and I should use this as something to bond over. I was a bit ticked, so I sent my sister a message saying that her gift ideas were far too extravagant and I will get her something reasonable.\r  \n\r  \nMy sister has now told the whole family that I am not keeping the spirit of Christmas alive, and she would like to boycott the celebrations. She is hosting a seperate dinner at her house for anyone who \"doesn't want to socialise with Scrooge\", and my mom is devestated that I am making her choose between her children on Christmas. Other family members are saying they don't want to get in the middle and would rather not go to either dinner. I feel like I have ruined Christmas and my son's birthday. Am I being the AH? Should I just buy the gift?", "created_utc": 1701137236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/185kr3h/aita_for_refusing_to_buy_an_expensive_christmas/", "score": 1548, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s manipulation in the finest.", "NTA.  Post online....Scrooge here, anyone wanna switch secret Santa's?  My sister, aka my recipient is  expecting...then list items.  \n\n\nI mean in this economy, I'd be happy with 50 dollars.", "NTA", "NO!!! Do not \"buy\" her anything.   Instead, set up an easel and paint her a picture of a lonely, cranky woman who just looks like her by chance.  \n\nSeriously, if your mom is so insistent that she get something on her list, tell your mom that you want to switch who you are the secret santa for.  Being able to \"afford\" it is irrelevant - sister is being an AH.  Send her \"list\" with the stipulation for everything to be \"for two\" and ask them all which of them wants to switch with you and apparently the upper limit for gifting is somewhere in the $10,000 range so you expect to receive something of equal value to what your sister wants.\n\nThen plan your Christmas accordingly and if some family members decide to go to her place instead of coming to yours, you know who to go LC with in the future.  NTA", "NTA, I hope you post and update", "Trade her name with someone else or just go with the rules and spend 50 bucks in a gift.", "Of course you're NTA.  I'd get her a $50 Visa gift card and tell her to enjoy...or be petty and give her $50 Monopoly money.", "Get her a $50 voucher towards a therapy session. NTA", "NTA. Switch your Secret Santa with your mom. Then the mom can bite that bullet.", "NTA. Both your mother and sister are being ridiculous. You are definitely not ruining Christmas. Your mother started this dumpster fire and your sister is hosing it down with oil.", "YTA (sort of...), you said something to your blabbering mother.  And no...a financial gift is not something to 'bond over'.", "Give a 50 dollar voucher.  Problem solved", "if OP's sister is child free and untethered to a man, why can't she buy herself those things?\n\nNTA, if you give in OP, you will be setting a precedent for the future. Your mother and sister will always ask you to be the person to overextend themselves to \"mend\" the family", "NTA Honestly at this point you should just focus on being happy and celebrating your kids first birthday. Eff your sister and your mom a bit. \n\n Xmas is suppose too be about celebrating with your family basically, gifts are just extra. If they don't wanna celebrate with you, sucks for them. They can be miserable by themselves without dragging everyone else in.", "NTA. Your mom defeated the purpose of Secret Santa by telling your sister you had drawn her name. I like the gift card idea several others had. Either that, or share this post with your family. Let them know that the spirit was broken by your mom opening her mouth, and your sister's greed exacerbated it. Ask if anyone would like to trade in order to keep some peace for the holiday. But be prepared to host fewer people. You didn't ruin anything. Your mother and sister did.", "NTA, anyone who would complain about their Christmas gift being to cheap is in it for the wrong reasons", "NTA - Good Grief . . . money spent never mends a relationship. Buy your sister a nice book about the meaning of family.  Maybe get your mom a book about keeping her mouth shut. She is the main problem here . .  obviously causing a rift between the two sisters. Your mother should explain to your sister that her expectations are unreasonable and outrageous . . instead, it sounds like she is agreeing with her. YOU have done nothing wrong. Back off from extended family for a bit as some of them are downright harmful. Host a nice Christmas Dinner for other people who don't have big dramatic families and make a rule . . . NO gifts!", "Get her nothing.do this instead, tell your family Christmas is at your sisters house and go enjoy yourself bring your baby, try to wake him up from a nap so he extra fussy. \n\nThen have a birthday party at your place the next day.  Invite your sister and tell her as a birthday present your son will require a $5000.00 gift card or savings bond.\n\nThat will alleviate the issue with your Mom, you don\u2019t have to spend hours cooking and cleaning and you have plenty of time to prepare for your kiddos birthday.\n\nIf you have a group family text, text  everyone at once.  Family announcement: Christmas dinner is now taking place at sisters house, the next day we celebrate the birth of my son at our place.  NTA but your sister sounds like a brat.  Oh and btw get her a $10 gift card NTA", "I hope your response on the group chat was:  I am unable to spend thousands of dollars on one person\u2019s christmas gift.  My secret Santa person has obviously discovered who picked her name and is making unreasonable demands.  If this makes me a Scrooge then so be it.   Merry Christmas everyone!", "Your sister is responsible for this with her greed. Not you. Her. Your mother didn't help of course. \n\nHave Christmas at home and anyone who wants to come can come. But better that than giving in to her whims. You are not making anyone choose. Your sister is by hosting an alternative event when you were hosting. I really don't get how your mother is saying you are making her choose.

For fucks sake", "My family has a minimum spend of $75 with no maximum and everyone spends between like $75-115 because we\u2019re all sane and normal people. Not a problem unless your family is unreasonable and greedy", "I was going to suggest something like this too. \n\nA price range is great because it means everyone is getting something of similar value and not like one person gets a cruise and another gets a set of movie tickets. It's a way to make sure it's fair and balanced.\n\nI'd also might be petty enough to say that \"someone\" spilled the secret and ruined the whole thing, by the recipient asking for gifts not in spirit of the exchange.\n\nAnother idea could be a Yankee Swap or White Elephant... same idea different names depending on where you live. So that way folks that may e already bought their gift can still reuse it. You are buying for a general pool of gifts rather than for a person.", "Here\u2019s a start to the cruise in Italy ($50)", "Diabolical!"]}
