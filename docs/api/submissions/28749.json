So first of all, you have that completely backwards. You choose your friends, not your relatives. (Edit: Upon re-read, I'm not sure where I got the idea that OP's cousin is her second-cousin. I suppose a first cousin is on the liminal ground between \"a relative\" and \"barely a relative\", but my main thrust still stands. You have it backwards by placing friends after relatives. You chose your friends. You didn't chose your cousin.)\n\nAnd secondly, OP *isn't in a situation*. I would feel exactly *nothing* about it, because my cousin or my friend or a total stranger having sex with somebody I am not in a relationship with is *not my problem*.

What about her parent? There\u2019s no messing with DNA in either of those scenarios, so it\u2019d be fine right??? \n\nWell, I'd certainly be concerned if my parent was having sex with somebody college-aged.

It's not a situation at all. It's one child having a half sibling who is also a cousin. This is not that much more unusual than having an aunt or uncle who is younger than you are - it's a thing that happens sometimes.\n\nAnd the person who is making this imaginary situation worse is the one who apparently wants to lie to her child about it.

In my experience no kid wants a sibling, and those who do realize that they actually didn't when they see that that means their parents would give them less attention."]}
