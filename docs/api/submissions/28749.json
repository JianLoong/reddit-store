This is another thing you shouldn't lie to your child about.

None of this is difficult to explain to a child, so long as you don't start off by lying to them. Children don't believe silly stories about cabbages or storks because that's a natural stage of child development, they do it because some adult told them a story instead of the truth, and then some other adult later has to correct that.\n\nThere are many age-appropriate books that will help you explain to your child about babies.", "Strike up the banjos", "But why?

So you\u2019re not TAH for being upset, but you are one for thinking negatively about your cousin bc she likes sex. \n\nIt was also wrong of her to sleep with your ex without considering your feelings, but calling her names makes you the bad person.

They can understand the concept of half siblings easily", "My daughter is six. She can absolutely understand that any kids her mom or I have are her half siblings (we aren\u2019t together anymore). It\u2019s not a difficult thing if you explain it to them.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s her brother and any child therapist will tell you it\u2019s best to tell her young and normalize it so it\u2019s not a shock and disturbing as they get older. This is OPs cousins baby and will be around a lot.", "The point is that if the daughter keeps being told 'this is your little brother' then she is being set up to expect a sibling relationship with the child. OP clearly doesn't get along with the baby's mother and having no claim on this baby herself cannot promise such a relationship... nor should she be obliged to any more than any parent needs to foster relationships with an ex-partner's new family. In all practical senses these two children are not likely to be raised as siblings, the more accurate explanation here is 'daddy has another baby.' And it's really on the dad to promote any further relationship between these children but there is nothing of the sort on the table right now and may never be.\n\nI don't think OP is suggesting her daughter can't grasp the concept of having a sibling. But when people say 'children are smarter than people give them credit for' a lot of the time what they're describing is the exact opposite where they believe a child will just magically accept *anything* you tell them without coming to it with their own prior knowledge. A five-year-old will already have some awareness of social norms and assumptions surrounding family and siblings. Five-year-olds know that *most* families are made up of a mother and father and the kids will live with at least one of them. They can understand if their situation is different too, but they *will* realise they are different and that's hard for a child. Brother/sister are terms with a lot of assumed meaning too. Can a five-year-old grasp the concept of a purely biological family relationship vs. who actually becomes 'family'? Let alone the interpersonal adult drama in *this* situation? Maybe, but it's a lot to place on a child. The *adults* in the situation still don't have their shit together on this and it's absolutely reasonable for OP to want to keep the word 'brother' out of the equation for a while yet until everyone knows more about how things are going to work so that the child is *not* forced to be in the middle of adult drama.\n\nUltimately it's not like this will even stay a 'secret' obviously so it's dramatic for anyone to object to OP being intent on managing how it's revealed. Just laying everything out in front of children thoughtlessly isn't 'honesty', it's lazy parenting.", "It\u2019s her EX going after his exs COUSIN. Both are whory!", "My issue is that OP's cousin introduced the baby as a sibling and a cousin in the same sentence. I don't think a half sibling would be confusing at all.", "I'd be deeply concerned if an adult old enough to be OP's parent or grandparent was having a romantic or sexual relationship with her ex. The age differential is *serious*.\n\nAs for her brother and sister - why is she getting so hung up on who he sleeps with? She's gotta know he's not celibate. It has been several years since they were together.", "Huh? Sex is exactly what she wanted.", "It\u2019s her\u2026 cousin?
