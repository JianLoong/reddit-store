I\u2019ve grown to accept his stance as he\u2019s grown to accept mine. \n\nI am child free, he is not.\n\nThe issue I\u2019m having is that he currently works a dead end job in fast food with no intention of getting a higher paying job. And he wants to have kids in 1-2 years with his gf of 8 months that\u2019s only 19. So she\u2019d be 21 when they have kids. He also wants her to be a stay at home mom. \n\nLow paying job, no second income, very young, no home, neither of them have vehicles. I just had to give it to him straight because this sounds like a recipe for disaster and I can already see him begging me for money for his kids. Which I don\u2019t want to deal with.\n\nI told him my bf doesn\u2019t want them coming over to our house so there will be no free babysitting when you have them. That pissed him off but there\u2019s nothing he could really say to that as it\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s request. \n\nI also told him that\u2019s not smart and you need to get a better job and a car and wait until you\u2019re a little older. And start saving some money. He got mad and said I just don\u2019t want him to have kids at all. Honestly, he\u2019s not wrong because I don\u2019t think he\u2019d make a good father **but I would never tell him that.** He said I just hate children and don\u2019t want to see him have a legacy. Like wtf. I don\u2019t care I just don\u2019t want to see him ruin his life. I tried my best to explain to him the sheer amount of responsibility he\u2019s putting on his plate.\n\nHe says he can handle it and he doesn\u2019t need my negativity. \n\nHe said he\u2019d rather struggle and have a family then wait until he\u2019s old. I tried to explain to him 30 isn\u2019t old!?\n\nHe ended up calling me childish for not wanting a family and hanging up on me\u2026 \n\nMy mom called today and told me I was rude for judging my brother so harshly and telling him to get a better job\u2026 AITA?\n\nShould I have just kept my mouth shut? I wasn\u2019t trying to shame him but according to my mom and brother I did\u2026\n\nEDIT: For people asking \u201cDid he ask for your opinion?\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea\u201d and he then asked \u201cWhy?\u201d So I answered.\n\nEDIT #2: For those of you concerned about my bf \u201cbanning family\u201d from our home. We both agreed no kids. We don\u2019t want them running around breaking stuff and we have nothing to entertain them with. That rule doesn\u2019t mean family can\u2019t come over. Like what? We literally live with MY little brother (18m). And have family over all the time.. just not kids because it\u2019s a child free home. Not that extreme. I told my brother when he has kids he can come over for a break.", "created_utc": 1696016471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vl8d8/aitah_for_telling_my_22f_brother_23m_to_not_have/", "score": 292, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he doesn't have a job that allows him to maintain a family of 3 (and a child has definitely more needs than we do), doesn't want to TRY finding a job that would allow him, doesn't want to get a vehicle (which is a personal choice, but let's be real, is this gonna help), and wants children for a legacy, your telling me he is not naive? I can see why she feels worried. And again HE'S HER BROTHER. She's giving an opinion to a sibling.", "Going against everyone, NTA.\nI see why you feel worried. Having children is not only about US, about wanting to build a family and have a legacy, it should be mainly about THEM, the children. As described, the environment doesn't sound adequate yet. It's a great responsibility. I totally agree with your opinion and personally think that there's nothing wrong with talking to him about your worries.", "He asked your opinion, you gave him an honest, reasonable answer and he goes running to Mommy saying 'Big sis was mean to me, go ream her out as I'm upset.' And Mummy does just that.\n\nMature enough to have children - Not.", "Ruin his legacy??? Tf???", "NTA \n\nI'm really surprised at all these YTA.\n\nI'm all for having kids but you need a game plan on how exactly you'll take care of them. Don't have your own place? Are you going to get one or are your parents OKAY with you living with them? Don't have a car? Are you able to borrow your parents or can you get a stroller and reliable public transport? How will you pay for everyone to eat? \n\nYou don't necessarily need all those things, they REALLY help and you should have them but you just need to have a game plan. It sounds like he doesn't at ALL. Probably is hoping to live in the basement for the rest of his life and mooch off relatives. Which honestly is a sad outcome for a child and they deserve better then the bare minimum. He's probably just really upset that you called him out and didn't go along with his fantasy. Everyone else in his life probably lied to him and said \"oh that's nice and smart\".", "He's setting himself up for failure. Honestly, he gets what he deserves but his children don't deserve to be brought into this world just to suffer the consequences of his selfish plans, all because he needs some half-baked legacy to satisfy his ego. You want a legacy? Focus on a career, build a positive name for yourself. Children are not trophies or milestones. They are human beings that require care and stability. If you cannot provide that for them, you are not fit to be a parent. Period.\n\n> For people asking \u201cDid he ask for your opinion?\u201d \n\nIgnore these people. They are narrow minded and obviously do not care about the struggles his potential children would have to endure because of his impulsive, selfish desires. His way of thinking is the reason the world is as fucked up as it is and deserves to be called out. Between your mother babying him, and him potentially passing his backward ideals to his struggling kids, someone in your family has to have the backbone, and the good sense, to shut this nonsense down.\n\nAll he's going to do is add to the number of broken kids being brought up in our society, and we don't need anymore of that. If his consequences impacted him, and only him, I'd say mind your business but there's more at stake than his fragile ego.\n\nNTA, obviously.", "I'm so tired of ppl having kids and not actually being a fully functional adult. Nta", "No, your brother is an idiot and your mom is an enabler. He's completely selfish and his \"struggle\" than he can endure will also be borne by everyone around him including his would be kids. It's virtually child abuse.", "NTA- somebody needs to tell him this .\n\nBetter yet , tell his gf before he babytraps her into his loser life.", "NTA. Bringing a child into this world completely unprepared is horrible, and your brother needs to know that. He seems to be living in a delusional world, and your mother seems to be an enabler. He needs to be financially stable first before even thinking about children.", "NTA, at all. You tried to save him from himself, and it didn\u2019t work. You\u2019re absolutely right, this is 100% a recipe for a disaster. You made it clear to him that you don\u2019t want anything to do with his kids when he has them, and so, from this point on, it doesn\u2019t affect you if he has kids or not, or when he has them. So, move on. You\u2019ve done everything you can, if he wants to ruin his life, then that\u2019s on him. Since this isn\u2019t going to affect you, then my advice is to just leave him alone. If it doesn\u2019t affect you or hurt anybody, then he can do whatever he wants, even if it\u2019s not good for him or his girlfriend. \nThat being said, does your brother\u2019s girlfriend agree with his views? Like, does she want to be a stay at home mom while her boyfriend works a minimum wage job? Does she know all this? Because I don\u2019t care if a person want to be a stay at home parent, but that only works if one of the parents has the income to support the entire family, and this is clearly not the case. Seems a bit suspicious to me.", "NTA - the issue is not him ruining his life -for that he\u2019s already doing a great job - it\u2019s his willingness to ruin others life in his fantasy. What a mess already, and disaster to come.", "If family members can't express opinions about potentially life-altering mistakes, who can? More people should be willing to tell those close to them that they might be making a mistake. People these days think they should never be subject to criticism because they can do whatever they want no matter what. That is a bad policy.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA. It sounds like he asked. I would be careful about it, but you should be clear about what you feel your responsibilities are (which should be nothing you don't want to do at the time).\n\nPersonally based on what you've said, I agree. You should be financially successful before you have children. Otherwise you're giving them a life of misery.", "NTA. I would be worried about the children. I know there's been more and more talk of how the stress of the parents impacts a child, especially as their brain is forming. I think as time goes on there will be even more evidence brought to light. Your brother is thinking of himself and not the wellbeing of a child.", "NTA. You\u2019re trying to give him a badly needed reality check, children cost money! It\u2019s fine you can tell you\u2019re mother she can give him money every time he comes begging and she can babysit because you won\u2019t be doing either.", "NTA.   It seems like you were as patient and kind as you could be when laying down some hard truths that he quite aggressively plans on ignoring.    All you can do is hope for the best for him and be a respite for him to come get some peace sometimes after he makes terrible decisions that will last him the rest of his life.", "I'd probably be in your shoes in the same situation. He and his partner aren't ready to be parents. They lack finances and emotional maturity. I can guarantee that they'll be knocking at your and mom's door for free babysitting. They're gonna get so tired of the crying, diaper changing, vomiting, and sleepless nights. They're gonna wonder where their twenties went. They're gonna dump their kid on grandma a lot. \n\nYou're NTA for trying to talk sense into him. He's gonna have to learn the hard way and, unfortunately, the child will be the brunt of it. Far too many people have children when they shouldn't and the innocent kids end up suffering for it.", "NTA he asked your opinion and then pressed you on the issue. You laid out a very logical argument and pointed out very important things. Your brother is not being realistic and if he has kids as it is now, he will not be able to provide for them. They will suffer for this.", "NTA. You told him some harsh truths and he's not receptive to them. Now it's up to him to figure it out on his own. When he and his gf see how hard it actually is with kids, they're going to be eating a lot of crow. Just reiterate your stance as often as possible that you will not be there to help out in any way, and stick to your guns.", "Your brother sounds as much of a pain as mine, I feel you. NTA, stay strong, don't give in later", "You\u2019re nta. Him saying \u201cI\u2019d rather struggle than have kids when I\u2019m old\u201d is completely immature because him struggling means his kids will struggle. He would rather have his kids struggle than to wait on his \u201clegacy\u201d. If he has the kids now his legacy will be of being a bad father and being completely selfish because disregarding how well you could meet your kids\u2019 needs in the name of a \u201clegacy\u201d is just flat out being a bad parent. People go through money troubles and get extreme anxiety surrounding money and need therapy. Also he\u2019s talking about struggling right now, but if he doesn\u2019t have plans to get a better job doesn\u2019t that just mean him and his kids would struggle all throughout life. And with money getting tighter that can make him more stressed out and more likely to resent the kids. I think he needs to wait", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an ah. But all these comments saying you are have lost their minds and are reading wayyy too deep into things that aren\u2019t specified. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong and I know you\u2019re concerned for your brother but personally he\u2019s an adult and I\u2019d sit back and let him make his mistakes and just hope that he stabilizes himself for his future children. \n\nSidenote: As a 23yr old myself it\u2019s kinda weird that he\u2019s dating a teenager. I see anyone under 20 as a baby to me \ud83d\ude2d", "Edit: Nta, These YTA is crazy, op a lot of these people probably don\u2019t have family so they don\u2019t know how this works. You weren\u2019t being mean or condescending you were telling the truth. My brothers don\u2019t have to ask me for my option to give to them. I also don\u2019t just let my opinions fall out unless it\u2019s something serious and this is serious. To me it feels like you just gave him something to think on and hopefully he does. You can\u2019t force him not but you\u2019re Nta. You were right and the stay at home plan???? With what money??????", "NTA. Let\u2019s be real, your brother is entranced with the idea of having a family and children, and since he isn\u2019t a woman, and is essentially expecting his partner to do all the parenting work, he\u2019s never going to see the reality of it all until it\u2019s far too late. Talking to him is always going to be a wall. \n\nOne thought is has he mentioned his expectations to his partner? He\u2019s determined to dig himself into a hole, you can\u2019t change that yourself, but you can inform his partner if they aren\u2019t made aware. If she is aware, then set your boundaries and close your door. I know you love and care for your brother, but the way he\u2019s acting shows that he won\u2019t treat your kindness with that same respect. \n\nAll the best.", "NTA. You were being honest with him. It\u2019s not rude to want to have a talk about something that will have a huge impact on his and his girlfriend\u2019s life. So many people say how hard having kids are. It\u2019s work. It challenges even good relationships. And it costs a lot of money. I can see a parent staying home to save on daycare costs but they will not have enough with retail or food industry money. Yes there are government programs to help but working towards another financial goal is important. \nSome questions from me are why doesn\u2019t he have any higher work goals?  What are the girlfriend\u2019s goals?  I see nothing about that in his thinking other than what he expects from her. Does she want kids?  Does she want to stay home? \nAnd why does he want kids?  He mentioned a legacy is that what this is about?  That\u2019s a poor and selfish  reason to bring a human into the world.", "You\u2019re not saying don\u2019t have kids\u2026.you\u2019re saying don\u2019t do it right NOW", "Nta.

Your brother is stupid. He is the selfish one. Watch him dip as soon as he realizes how much work kids are.", "Nta", "NTA. Your brother is living in a fantasy if he thinks his current situation is sustainable when throwing kids into the mix.", "So different approach.....don't be so concerned about him ruining HIS life. He already has by the lack of motivation. Even if you don't like kids, worry about the potential kids he could have and how he would be ruining THEIR lives by bringing them into the world selfishly with no plan to actually be able to care for them.", "NTA. Even though it was an unsolicited opinion, he's family and there's nothing wrong with trying to help family. \n\nHe sounds like he's got his head in the clouds and you were only trying to get him to be more realistic.\n\nAlso, kudos for warning him ahead of time that he shouldn't count on you for babysitting.", "I\u2019d make it painfully clear to him that you are not willing to provide any financial support or free babysitting. \n\nYou are NTA. I hate when people have kids because they don\u2019t want to be \u201cold parents\u201d but they having nothing in place to care for the child once it\u2019s born. That\u2019s sooo selfish!! Kids are expensive and time consuming\u2026 it\u2019s better to wait until you\u2019re in a better position to take care of them.", "NTA, at the very least you needed to let him know you would not be taking any kids off their hands. He can't complain now that you aren't helping him out and how hard it is. You warned him.", "NTA\n\nAs a father of 4 and the sole provider, your brother isn't ready. Your brother isn't anywhere near ready. He couldn't find ready with both hands and a map. He'll either heed your warning, or learn the hard way that you are right.", "NTA!!   IF, you do not have the \"resources\" to properly and/or financially provide for the child(ren);  don't have them!!  A dead-end fast food job isn't near enough!\n\nAs you describe it, that is a miserable life without a child!  He is only thinking of himself.  He says he'd rather \"suffer with a family\", but he isn't considering that the resulting child will suffer too, because of his selfishness.\n\nHe wants a \"legacy\"?  Make something of his life! A child IS NOT a possession or \"your legacy\", or a welfare check.", "NTA. Just be prepared to to go nc with him and if he wants to live in poverty, let him.", "My nephew said the same things when he knocked up his girlfriend at 19... He is now a single father whose baby momma doesn't even want to see her own kid. He works 2 jobs and still cannot afford to live without a roommate. Kid desperately needs therapy that daddy cannot even begin to afford.  He will never go back to college and the jobs that he is working now are slowly destroying his body.\n\nGood that you put your foot down now about the baby sitting. Reiterate there will be no cash donations or other monetary support for his kid coming from you if he chooses to be an idiot and have a baby while working for minimum wage.\n\nNo children in your home is a perfectly valid rule I have implemented myself. Too many liabilities as I have several former feral cats that I would not trust small children around.\n\nEdit for judgement \n\nNTA", "Nta your brother is doing something foolish by planning children with a woman he has been with less than a year while he makes barely enough to support himself and not actually planning his future. He wants kids, awesome, but how is he gonna afford it?", "NTA your brother is immature and unrealistic.  His \u201ccareer\u201d is a job that high school students with no work experience often feel is beneath them and he thinks he can support a wife and kids on that income? His income doesn\u2019t even support him owning a car. You are being entirely sensible in this situation.", "NTA. Having a legacy is not a good reason to have kids. What's he gonna do? Pass on his McDonalds name tag?", "Good, doesn\u2019t sound like he was receptive of it but someone had to tell him. He\u2019s setting his new family up for failure if he can\u2019t atleast be on a half decent career path to make more money. If he could atleast get into something entry level that has room to improve later in life, fast food has a low salary cap\u2026 if he can get into trades work, they pay well and it\u2019s all on the job training", "This would not be my fantasy future, certainly. But, I've seen other people make more than a go in similar circumstances.\n\nSo, as long as your brother understands why you disagree and respects that you aren't his back up plan NAH. Your being honest was no insult to him IMO.", "The reality is that he\u2019s not going to listen to anything you or anyone else says.\n\nI agree with a lot of what you\u2019re saying, he is too young, his gf is too young, to think that they can have kids and get by while he works in a fast food checkout and she becomes a stay at home mom is completely unrealistic\u2026 he clearly needs a reality check but he is not going to take it from you..\n\nThe main reason he won\u2019t listen to you above anyone else is that you are staunch in your view on kids, that you don\u2019t want any, you don\u2019t see it the same way he does, you\u2019re the complete opposite. Nothing you say is going to register with him.\n\nI would say it\u2019s your mom that should be worried about this\u2026 cos what\u2019s gonna happen when kids do come along and they start to struggle and need financial help? She\u2019s first on the list.\n\nThe main thing here though is to remember that while you\u2019ve given him your opinion, you can\u2019t make his choices for him, it\u2019s his life to fuck up as he chooses, as it is with everyone else\u2026 \nSo I would drop this and stop worrying over it, there\u2019s nothing you can do and to keep badgering him would be interfering - he\u2019s heard what you have to say, repeating it several times won\u2019t make him see sense, it\u2019ll just cause more arguments", "NTA. To me your concerns are valid. You told him to better his life BEFORE  having kids, not TO NOT HAVE THEM ENTIRELY.!", "NTA - he's lucky there's someone in his life thinking about this stuff. If he's upset by hearing those hard truths, he's going to be a lot more upset if he has kids and has to live with those truths.", "I am going to say NTA. While you may change your mind about children down the line (you may not and that is totally fine), your reasoning for your brother is sound. Children are very expensive and unless management level in fast food, one income will not be enough. Most people making more than your brother need 2 or more incomes to get by. I wouldn't say fast food is a dead end job though, people can work up to management, corporate etc. They also don't have cars, children have to go to the doctor, dentist, school and then add activities (although with only his income that may not be in the budget) into that, transportation that is easily accessible is a must. They are also very young. Yes, young people can be great parents but children add a level of stress that can't be understood until you have children. Parenting is hard and it doesn't sound like your brother has fully thought through all that it will entail.", "NTA I agree with your assessment of your brother's current inability to raise a child successfully.", "NTA. What a \u201clegacy\u201d he\u2019d be passing on.", "NTA. Tell your mother you hope she enjoys contributing to your brother's household. And, if possible, move further away, because they will try to draft you into childcare or bill paying. Your brother is sadly immature; it's going to be too bad if innocent children are born to such an unprepared fool.", "Hopefully Grandma enjoys being a built-in daycare and probably taking all of them in when reality comes crashing down. NTA", "NTA, you merely raised excellent points, as for not wanting to take care of any of his future children.  That's totally your right, but no need to worry. It seems like your mom will be fine offering her services.", "NTA.\n\nAll it would take, if he went through with that plan, for him to lose custody of his kids and for you to get a phonecall from a social worker asking if you can temporarily assume emergency custody would be two back-to-back disasters. The death of your mom and the loss of his job, two perfectly commonplace events, which could occur simultaneously if your mother happened to die in a car accident that took out his only reliable transportation, could absolutely cost him his work, his home, and at least temporarily, custody of his future children because he is so brutally naive as to think full-time SAHPs are even *possible* for families making under six figures in this economy without enormous advantages of connections, generational wealth and preexisting assets, none of which he has.\n\nWaiting until 28 and 32 to add a human kid to the family (alongside the furry ones -her other sobriquet was 'the skin kitten' and we actually did announce her impending arrival with a sonogram captioned in lolcat font,) was the best move we ever made. Ever. My husband and I were well established professionally, I was able to work from home and go to grad school online, then switch careers to teaching so I could be on the same schedule and close by enough to handle complications of the kid's diagnosis with the school district (yeah, all the 'have kids while you're young! The money will work out!' brigade never seems to consider the autistic kind can show up at any parental age, but the older parents with assets and jobs can afford to shrug off medical and therapeutic needs that would beggar a 'young' family,) plus we had the resources to move her grandparents closer and into a more manageable home as they began to age and have health problems. \n\nDid it suck to have to wait? Eh, actually, not really. We found out about kitten fostering for the local SPCA shelter. All the bottle feeding, bottom wiping, keeping warm and snuggly love of babies, typically in three to six-pack litters, all of whom we got to name, love, look after and most of whom grew to be strong, well-socialized housepets who went on to magnificent homes. The few born with insurmountable problems, we loved, lost and grieved over, growing stronger together as a couple, such that we were ready to handle the worst life could throw at us long before we added an innocent baby human to the mix. As it happened, she was born prematurely, and when the nurses saw how blas\u00e9 we were about incubators and tube-feeding, how used to mixing tiny syringes of formula, we had a bit of explaining to do.\n\nOne nurse swore she'd hear purrs on our little girl's monitor, come to check, and find her with her tiny hand out, asleep, with a little smile. It might have just been a story to cheer up a postpartum mom, but I like to imagine the kittens who didn't get to grow up returned across the Bridge for a mission to guard and comfort their last, furless littermate while their parents couldn't be there in the NICU.\n\nKitten fostering, is what I suggest. His girlfriend might go for it. Get yourself a furry niece or nephew you can spoil the heck out of.", "You\u2019re the adult. Mom is not!", "NTA People who have kids when they\u2019re completely unprepared mentally or financially just make it harder on themselves and hard for those poor kids.

I'm a much calmer, more patient, and understanding person than I was at 25. Not to mention, I still had a lot of growing up to do myself. Your mid-20s  are a time for exploration and experiences.

It's HARD to have a child in these times, even with a decent paying job.

But at the end of the day it's his life! If he has kids it doesn't mean you won't be there for him, it just means you're not going to support someone who isn't responsible enough to support themselves.

Also him and his gf are still really young so there's no reason for him not to wait until he gets his shit together.

Telling someone they are being stupid when they are doing something irreversible that will affect the lives of others isn't an AH thing. This isn't about you and your brother, it's about you, your brother and his children and both setting expectations and pointing out potential serious risks is reasonable. For example, if you saw your brother playing Russian Roulette, you would be an AH if you didn't say something about the obvious risks.

Like what? We literally live with MY little brother (18m). And have family over all the time.. just not kids because it\u2019s a child free home.\n\nThat's actually pretty extreme. It's going to be considered very extreme as family and friends who are not child free stay having kids. It's your home, and you deserve to be comfortable.

Your hatred of children is getting in the way of your relationship with your brother. That\u2019s something you need to decide if that\u2019s the hill you\u2019re willing to die on. And you will get shit from your family, because it is a weird hard line to draw. You have such contempt for children and your brother\u2019s idea of family that you don\u2019t hide it in your writing.

Sure is your stance about no kids in the home at all a little...extreme? Yep (and probably not going to last long), but that doesn't really have anything to do with the fact that your brother is being a complete dumbass.

How does he think he's going to pay dr bills, food, baby supplies, school supplies, all the random crap kids need? And the fact that he has no desire/intention of getting a better paying job???

No offense meant it is simple biology.\n\nRight now he should not wasting time on girls, and should focus on doing something with his financial situation.

Your concerns are valid, but in your edit, you mention that you said, \"I don't think it's a good idea.\" That's an opinion statement and a bait. As a sibling myself, I use this to be condescending when it's not something that is particularly dangerous. As a sister who is close to the age of your brother, and given your disposition already, it really feels like this is the case. Him asking why is taking the bait, which opens you up to give a full opinion, which wasn't really asked for. You can't tell what your brother will do when the child comes into his life, and maybe his attitude will change. The best you can do is be there for your brother in whatever he decides.

Apologise again, then offer to help him calculate the potential costs he will be looking at. Suggest he looks up the price of things like a pram, cot, babygros, and nappies, then starts setting by a little money each month so that when he feels ready to try for a baby, he has enough money set aside to do so straight away. \nDon't worry about listing everything. Once he starts down the rabbit hole of baby items, he will develop his own long list, the sums will be real to him, and he may decide that he needs to change some of his plans in order to afford a baby. \nThe gf is young, but he is 23.

I mean these kids don't even exist yet, and you all feel the need to tell your bro he isn't welcomed at your house? Yikes, that's pretty cold and unnecessary. Are you kinda pissed at your boyfriend for drawing this ridiculous line in the sand against your family? \n\nThat along with your language used in this post lead me to think you didn't deliver this information in a way that was supportive and constructive.

Ok, so biologically, we start being able to procreate much younger than society typically has kids because physically it\u2019s extremely demanding, on both parties.

Idk your personal situation, if my kids did that ever, I\u2019m gonna make sure it\u2019s the last time. Period. Take that how you want to, unless he abused you or you met later in life. Fourth, children and the concept of \u201cmy child\u201d creates a bond so deep you truly cannot comprehend it. Idk what world you think most children are planned lol..99% are accidents. Hell your a weekend and a 4 pack of white claw away from having one yourself. Money works itself out if you want it bad enough and to see a kid want to not only be a father, but be involved is great. I\u2019ll go so far as to say if alimony/child support/section 8 etc weren\u2019t a thing, a lot of people wouldn\u2019t have too many nice things to say about a LOT of women.

I\u2019ve grown to accept his stance as he\u2019s grown to accept mine. \n\nI am child free, he is not.\n\nThe issue I\u2019m having is that he currently works a dead end job in fast food with no intention of getting a higher paying job. And he wants to have kids in 1-2 years with his gf of 8 months that\u2019s only 19. So she\u2019d be 21 when they have kids. He also wants her to be a stay at home mom. \n\nLow paying job, no second income, very young, no home, neither of them have vehicles. I just had to give it to him straight because this sounds like a recipe for disaster and I can already see him begging me for money for his kids. Which I don\u2019t want to deal with.\n\nI told him my bf doesn\u2019t want them coming over to our house so there will be no free babysitting when you have them. That pissed him off but there\u2019s nothing he could really say to that as it\u2019s my boyfriend\u2019s request. \n\nI also told him that\u2019s not smart and you need to get a better job and a car and wait until you\u2019re a little older. And start saving some money. He got mad and said I just don\u2019t want him to have kids at all. Honestly, he\u2019s not wrong because I don\u2019t think he\u2019d make a good father **but I would never tell him that.** He said I just hate children and don\u2019t want to see him have a legacy. Like wtf. I don\u2019t care I just don\u2019t want to see him ruin his life. I tried my best to explain to him the sheer amount of responsibility he\u2019s putting on his plate.\n\nHe says he can handle it and he doesn\u2019t need my negativity. \n\nHe said he\u2019d rather struggle and have a family then wait until he\u2019s old. I tried to explain to him 30 isn\u2019t old!?\n\nHe ended up calling me childish for not wanting a family and hanging up on me\u2026 \n\nMy mom called today and told me I was rude for judging my brother so harshly and telling him to get a better job\u2026 AITA?\n\nShould I have just kept my mouth shut? I wasn\u2019t trying to shame him but according to my mom and brother I did\u2026\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Keep reaching though I find your replies comical.", "I do if they ask me and there are children\u2019s lives at stake.", "That's your problem and you didn't have to make it his problem.", "You should really be able to pick up on paraphrasing.\n\nUnless your original \"I think that's not a good idea\" was after he said something along the lines of \"We're thinking about having kids in a few years, *how do you feel about that?*\" then you're still the AH specifically because your opinion was NOT asked for.\n\nYou initiated the entire issue by, out of nowhere, saying \"I think that's not a good idea!\"\n\nLike I said, you'll have to pick if you want a relationship with your brother or if you want to be right. It's becoming more and more obvious which is more important to you.", "Do you have an allergy or something? While you might be right in this specific instance, outright banning children from entering your house does make you sound like an absolute asshole.", "Do you not consider children your family?", "If your parents are broke and presumably know how hard it is then why are they supporting this? Shouldn't they be voices of reason?", "everyone is biased about everything. having an opinion is bias. so, by your logic, people should stop giving advice to each other about anything?\n\nfurther, OP\u2019s brother asked OP why she felt the way she did. he opened the door, she is fully allowed (and encouraged) to walk through it.", "Yeah so it seems you gave your opinion first and then when he asked why you \u201cgave it to him straight.\u201d  That\u2019s totally different from asking \u201cwhat do you think of my plan?\u201d So yeah YTA. You come from a good place but you still crossed a line since he didn\u2019t ask what you thought and you didn\u2019t ask if it was ok for you to share your thoughts.", "Why are you talking like you were there?? You\u2019re reading a shortened version of a story. Calm down LMAOOO", "He's her brother \ud83d\ude05 I think it's natural to be worried and to wanting to warn him about the importance of his choice", "He did though. And even if he didn\u2019t I will because I care about him.", "How many times do I have to tell you he did ask. And even if he didn\u2019t I\u2019m going to warn him of the risks he\u2019s taking because I *actually care* about my family.", "Unfortunately, we poor redditors have to go by what you include. What you included is how contentious your conversations about children have been.\n\nAh well.", "But he didn\u2019t ask. He did ask you to explain, but only AFTER you had already given your opinion. An option he didn\u2019t ask for. That makes you a rude, disrespectful, and nosy AH. You should stop that.", "You\u2019re just as naive as him", "You\u2019re an idiot.", "A surprising number of people hate children. Go figure.", "I do but they\u2019re not allowed in my home. When they\u2019re older they can but yea no kids allowed lol", "Omg, it's not like he and his girlfriend are actively TTC. This whole conversation is hypothetical and OP is offering advice that no one asked for. It's not like he's a teen and he's somehow more na\u00efve to the world than OP is. He's probably tired of hearing her childfree rhetoric all the time.", "Okay, cool. He's a grown ass man. He can live his life the way he wants. If you're \"triggered\" due to your childhood issues, seek therapy. Don't project your issues onto your brother. It's not like he's actively trying to impregnate his girlfriend. You started a squabble over something that isn't even an issue yet.", "OMG. Read your own edit where you CLEARLY state that he ONLY asked AFTER you already told him it wasn\u2019t a good idea. \n\nYou had already given your damn unsolicited opinion at that point. He didn\u2019t ask you to begin with UNTIL you opened your mouth. \n\nNo, you don\u2019t actually care. You just want to be right. You want to give everyone your opinion, whether they want it or not. That doesn\u2019t make you a good sibling or friend. That\u2019s what disrespectful AHs do. That\u2019s what immature teenagers do. It\u2019s not what decent, caring, grown adults do.", "He did. You want to die on the hill that he didn\u2019t so bad it\u2019s hilarious.", "We'll see. I can't wait for your future post \"My brother hates me and I don't know why!\"", "We don't hate children, we hate being forced to associate with them during the walking petri dish, super destructive phase of their life.", "LOL, jumping to \u201chate\u201d because someone prefers a childfree lifestyle. Doubly ironic since this post shows OP is already caring for her brother\u2019s hypothetical children as she\u2019s worried they won\u2019t be provided for.", "Don\u2019t assume I\u2019m always talking about this with him I have plenty of friends to do that with. It was sounds advice too..", "That\u2019s how prevent stupid shit from happening\u2026 you talk about it, you warn people. You sounds like the type of person to let someone crash and burn before you say anything. Because it\u2019s their life. Those are the words of someone who doesn\u2019t give a fuck about anyone lol.", "Read your own edit. Your the one saying he only asked after you already said something. \n\nSo either your lying in your edit (meaning you left out him asking before you said it\u2019s a bad idea) or your lying now. \n\nEither way, you\u2019re not a reliable narrator.", "He texted me a meme today lol not everyone is as petty as you.", "Then just tell your relative that. I do not want to be around your disgusting child until it grows up and is less of a threat to my health.", "What is a \"childfree lifestyle?\" If you don't want to have children, that is fine. If you are openly hostile to them, want nothing to do with them, and won't permit them in your house, then it sounds like you are an asshole.", "[deleted]", "OP has stated multiple times in various comments she\u2019s totally fine visiting children outside of her home. Maybe the home rule is extreme for you, but you\u2019re jumping to conclusions about how OP feels and acts. Not once does she seem hostile.\n\nYou also ignored me saying it\u2019s obvious OP cares about the wellness of these hypothetical kids. But it\u2019s fine, you just want to downvote people who aren\u2019t fans of children.", "Its because people like OP are AHs.", "I stated in a separate comment that I agree with OP's position. Her brother is an idiot.\n\nPerhaps people can care for children they wouldn't want in their home. Visiting children is fine too. So is having children in your home. Yes, I consider banning all children from your home the act of an asshole."]}
