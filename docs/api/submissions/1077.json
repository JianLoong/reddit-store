In March he sent us a quote (that he had asked for in january\u2026) and we agreed. \n\nMonths pass (very busy ones, lots of personal issues, kid got very sick etc) and we see a house on sale close to my workplace and my husbands workplace, with a lot more room (we have a kid) and a nice yard. We put in an offer in september and it was accepted. \n\nWe called my uncle and asked if he had put in any money yet to order the door.

My aunt refused to talk to my mother anymore (how is this even relevant). There were teary phonecalls. After a few weeks of this i said FINE.

Maybe tomorrow? \n\nAITA if i just call and cancel it? I am so done and i dont want our house messy and i am already stressed selling and buying a whole damn house?

Requesting a quote on January and it's November and the door still isn't here... I would cancel a well. It doesn't take2 months for a quote but i can see it taking 2+ months for delivery with how things are right now\n\nYou have VERY reasonable solutions which would mean no one would lose anything and a very reasonable timeline to get the work done. I say cancel and tell him you beg of done by Tuesday and it not them you so not need the door. It people are already not talking to you that's their issue. Otherwise, if you paid for the door. Tell him to not install it, put if on the basement of something and explain to the realtor the issue and the solution is available for then to just have installed", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
