However, I'm a hard worker so they promoted me anyways. \n\nLast week I let some guys go 30 mins early. Right before they left though, I called them up and asked if they could fill the airplane's water, a job that takes 5 mins and almost no effort. I was told over the phone by a guy I'll call Chris that none of them had been trained on this yet, so I sucked it up and did the job myself. Then I also noticed they left half their work undone, so I had to stay late cleaning up after them too.\n\nLater I learned that Chris and the others were trained how to do this particular job the week prior, so I reported this to my boss bc I stayed an extra hour after my scheduled time off to finish their half-assed work. \n\nKeep in mind leads get paid just a dollar an hour more than regular crew and the management at our station is extremely poor so I report directly to the head manager who's usually busy and works opposite shifts as me. This makes it extremely hard to keep workers in line because most of them are teens/young adults and I'm the only one on shift making sure rules are being followed. \n\nToday I brought it up to Chris, wanting to mention it's not fair that I have to stay late while they go home early and that respect goes both ways so I don't want to be lied to. I started by saying \"Did [boss] talk to you about last week?\" he said \"yeah\". I said \"well, thing is, I was told you were trained how to service water, but I was lied to by you and the other guys...\"\n\nHe cut me off there and went off the rails starting to accuse me of lying to my boss to get him in trouble. This blew up into an argument and he kept calling me a \"pussy\" for \"lying behind his back\" and other derogatory terms.\n\n I tried to de-escalate for a while but he was pretty much in full rage. It got to the point where he came up close to me and was threatening to actually fight. I told him \"I'm not childish, I'm not trying to fight here.\"\n\nAnyways, I have really bad anxiety, as time goes on I'm starting to think I'm somehow in the wrong here because he kept saying the only reason he got so angry was how I said it. So, AITA for the way I worded it when I brought it up him? \n\nI was gonna report him for this as well, but a lot of the people I work with were referred by him and are his close friends. They\u2019re making me feel like it\u2019s my fault.\n\nI've been trying to work on being more respected and assertive and overall care less what people think of me and this reaction really didn't help.\n\nEdit: Really appreciate all the advice. I know I\u2019m not the best fit for a manager as people have pointed out but I\u2019m trying to grow into it, this workplace just makes it really difficult with how the workers treat the managers. Also I see a lot of people are asking why I let them go early without making sure their work is done. \n\nThe issue is, it\u2019s an airport and leads have other responsibilities as well, were supposed to have a supervisor on shift watching the employees but my boss hasn\u2019t hired one in two years. So sometimes, I\u2019ll be across the airport getting something else done and we\u2019ll only be able to communicate through radio or phone. When there\u2019s no other options I take their word for it and they usually do an alright job, especially when flights arrive early. Every once in a while, I guess they\u2019ll be in a hurry so they\u2019ll leave work undone when I can\u2019t check. It gets reported but my boss doesn\u2019t really have the time or capacity to deal with it and that\u2019s why I tried talking to the employee directly this time.", "created_utc": 1678022209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iwx1s/aita_for_reporting_a_colleague_who_lied_about_his/", "score": 586, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're a bad leader. Telling them they could leave early without verifying everything was done was your fck up. It doesn't become theirs just because they didn't choose to stay and do 'one more thing' after you told them they could go. You're leadership, they aren't. It's expected of you to stay and go above and beyond in a way it isn't for them. You actually get paid extra for it. As soon as you said they were done, they were done.\n\nReporting them for 'lying' was extremely fcked up because you completely ignored that you manufactured this entire situation by telling them they could leave early. What you were supposed to do was take this entire thing as a lesson to not let anyone leave early and monitor more closely to ensure things were being done well but instead you're trying to actively hold someone else responsible for your management mistake.

Sometimes leaving is the answer but sometimes it's not so easy to just do that and it might not be so simple.\n\nWhat I do when I'm in a crappy situation (which I can't improve with my own power) is to look at the whole thing and identify what IS in my control/power. I build a metaphorical fence around that territory and vow to do my best within it. Anything outside of it I detach from emotionally and let go. People being insubordinate because you're not empowered to lead them? Well, then they do a crap job. Leaders ask why and you say what you tried (that within your power) which didn't work because (that outside your power). If they say try something else or try harder, ask them to be specific about what they want you to do and ask them how they will be empowering you to enforce your word.\n\nThey're not empowering you to do your job. They're probably in the same powerless situation as you so they're ignoring it and trying to make it your problem. You as an honorable human are sacrificing your personal self to solve it, but you shouldn't do that and no one should make you. If operations fail, well, those with power need to do something to fix it. Reiterate that you've done well within the scope of your granted authority and would gladly do more granted more staff/authority/training/compensation. Just make sure to always use language that aimed at improving operations. \n\nIf you don't find some kind of balance within the system you'll just get walked all over, like I did!

I would let HR know about the threat of violence to cover any mishaps that may happen later down the line.", "NTA.\n\nYou should report it to his boss. He acted very unethical. He deserves to lose his job.", "NTA  \nChris and his buddies are crappy employees.  \nAs for you, I read you are considering giving notice.  My advice to you, don't do that until you have another job lined up that is as good or better than this one.  It is easier to find a new job when you have a job.", "NTA. Chris is doing a great job at making a hostile work environment, in general. \n\nLet's step this up a notch: you work in baggage handling. If things aren't done right or reported accurately for the flight crew, that could (and has) bring down a plane, delay/cancel flights, result in job loss, or (in cases of plane crashes) loss of life. Just like pilots are expected to be professional and do their jobs exceptionally, so should baggage crew. You're all integral parts in being able to fly. Leaving work undone, scampering off to get out of doing assigned duties... that doesn't bode well for airlines, airport, and the rest of the staffs and flight crews that have to pick up the slack. Sounds like Chris thinks the job is an easy way to make $$ without having to do much. Maybe he needs to watch Air Disasters / Mayday to see just how important doing things thoroughly and properly is the best way to go.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "NTA. But also don\u2019t let people leave without knowing if they\u2019ve done their work or not. If you\u2019re their lead, you should also know what training they\u2019ve had so that\u2019s also poor on you\n\nI get you were thrown in to the job but that\u2019s no excuse to do it poorly. Maybe look and see if there are any leader training courses you can go on or something.", "Don\u2019t let anyone go early anymore. You did and they lied. You learned they can\u2019t be trusted. They taught you the lesson and can now enjoy the consequences.\n\nNTA", "Nta but as lead shouldn't you have checked everything was done before letting them go 30 mins early?\n\nYou seem to lack experience as a lead so I'm not blaming you but if people are finish I g work 30 early I'd be looking at \"why?\"\n\nIf it's their job to know how to fill water and part of their tasks, and they say they weren't trained to do it. I would have questioned that.", "Yep I\u2019m gonna be reporting it and handing in my two weeks as well. I\u2019m gonna talk to my boss about everything that\u2019s wrong and why we need more managers. The stress isn\u2019t worth it and having all your employees working as a mob against you is crazy.", "If you decide to stay, I recommend looking for resources to help you develop better management and assertiveness skills. Askamanager.org is a good place to start.", "Where I am, EA is the dysfunctional one and Menzies is the organized one. Grass is always greener I suppose", "If you decide to stay at your job or find yourself in a different leadership role and someone claims they don't know how to do a task you have assigned, just say \"Great, this can be a learning experience for you\" then proceed to train them. If they are lying they will most likely admit to because it will take twice as long for you to train them than if they just did it themselves, and if they are not lying they can learn a new task."]}
