Right before they left though, I called them up and asked if they could fill the airplane's water, a job that takes 5 mins and almost no effort. I was told over the phone by a guy I'll call Chris that none of them had been trained on this yet, so I sucked it up and did the job myself. Then I also noticed they left half their work undone, so I had to stay late cleaning up after them too.\n\nLater I learned that Chris and the others were trained how to do this particular job the week prior, so I reported this to my boss bc I stayed an extra hour after my scheduled time off to finish their half-assed work. \n\nKeep in mind leads get paid just a dollar an hour more than regular crew and the management at our station is extremely poor so I report directly to the head manager who's usually busy and works opposite shifts as me. This makes it extremely hard to keep workers in line because most of them are teens/young adults and I'm the only one on shift making sure rules are being followed. \n\nToday I brought it up to Chris, wanting to mention it's not fair that I have to stay late while they go home early and that respect goes both ways so I don't want to be lied to. I started by saying \"Did [boss] talk to you about last week?\" he said \"yeah\". I said \"well, thing is, I was told you were trained how to service water, but I was lied to by you and the other guys...\"\n\nHe cut me off there and went off the rails starting to accuse me of lying to my boss to get him in trouble.

It got to the point where he came up close to me and was threatening to actually fight. I told him \"I'm not childish, I'm not trying to fight here.\"\n\nAnyways, I have really bad anxiety, as time goes on I'm starting to think I'm somehow in the wrong here because he kept saying the only reason he got so angry was how I said it.

You're a bad leader. Telling them they could leave early without verifying everything was done was your fck up. It doesn't become theirs just because they didn't choose to stay and do 'one more thing' after you told them they could go. You're leadership, they aren't. It's expected of you to stay and go above and beyond in a way it isn't for them. You actually get paid extra for it. As soon as you said they were done, they were done.\n\nReporting them for 'lying' was extremely fcked up because you completely ignored that you manufactured this entire situation by telling them they could leave early. What you were supposed to do was take this entire thing as a lesson to not let anyone leave early and monitor more closely to ensure things were being done well but instead you're trying to actively hold someone else responsible for your management mistake. He absolutely should have remained professional (only realistic if he's at least 18) but you escalated first.", "[removed]", "The mental gymnastics to reach this conclusion are fascinating.", "Talk to your boss about them paying for some management classes for you. Or to find a mentor for you.

That would be a good opportunity to air some of the overall malaise that seems to be affecting this place, the evident lack of morale, and the lack of follow-up for issues such as non-performance and disrespect. Doing it in such a setting doesn't single anyone out, and may be a learning experience for people who have forgotten how to actually manage (your boss) and those still working on it (you). Plus, the suggestion will show HR and senior management that you really are thinking about how to improve the place - another bonus! Good luck - you sound like you have tremendous potential, but are being discouraged by some AHs who resent that fact merely because you're still so young.", "As is your superbly prepared and thoroughly convincing rebuttal.

You can't speak to coworkers like that", "I have to say that as a manager u didnt handle this situation as well as u could have initially. It doesn\u2019t mean your employee was right, they we\u2019re still in the wrong but you could have prevented this issue. First why would you let employees go 30 minutes early before you checked that they\u2019ve got their work done. From now on you need to institute a policy where someone wants to go early they need to have done their work and you were going to be checking to make sure that it\u2019s done also if they say they weren\u2019t trained on doing the water and it only takes a few minutes you could\u2019ve took the time right then to train those employees on how to do it. And perhaps you might want to start a policy where you have employees fill out a short Form to document when they are leaving early for what reason and your response either getting your permission or not giving you permission and checking off that their work was already completed and meets basic standards. Also include that they\u2019ve been trained on all the necessary duties  . Have them sign it you sign it and put it in a folder that way if there\u2019s ever an issue where the person lies about why they need to leave or that they\u2019ve not been trained on something you\u2019ll have that record . And you\u2019re less likely to face the situation again And gain more respect from the people who report to you. Good luck", "NTA. It sounds like these employees are intent on getting over. As long as you\u2019re in this position you will have to know exactly what they\u2019ve learned and insist they do it. Your $1 more an hour isn\u2019t so that you can do their work. Insist they do it and don\u2019t let anyone go early again because they\u2019ve shown you that they will screw you over if you do. Also, put issues on paper from now on.

Is any of this even worth it. Surely you could find another job getting 1 dollar an hour less but a reasonable work load/job.", "If this is the situation, you need to lay this out to the manager - in very clear language, take in notes so you are certain to hit all your points - and tell him that if the matter is not addressed IMMEDIATELY that you will be leaving.\n\nThen do it.\n\nJobs are like street cars; if you miss this one, there will be another along shortly.  It may make the route you travel a bit longer, but it will still get you where you intend to be.", "Your workplace is taking advantage of you. Safeway did this to me when I was 19. They gave me a dollar raise to be in charge of the whole store after the store manager went home. I was not equipped to deal with all the issues that came up. Luckily the few times I had problems like yours. The store manager supported me. \n\nWrite everything down, who said what and who did did what at what time. Bring this documentation with you and talk to your main manager. They are saving a ton of money by only paying you a dollar extra and putting the entire workload of another manager on your shoulders. If they are smart they will listen and fix it. If they don't, start looking for another job and contact HR and tell them you feel unsafe at work. \n\nLastly you did nothing wrong. The guy is a classic bully/abuser trying to blame his anger problems on you. There is no way that you could have phrased it that would have avoided this, and you shouldn't have to try. You are in charge of him. Imagine if your boss came to you over an issue, and instead of listening to the boss and addressing it, you freaked out and started screaming. How insane would that be? \n\n\n I also struggle with being assertive so I know how hard it can be. This is the perfect opportunity to learn and grow. I promise it won't be so hard next time.", "I only aks because this seems to be a management issue as well, and probably not for AITA.", "NTA.
