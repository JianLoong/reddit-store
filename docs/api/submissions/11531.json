{"id": 11531, "submission_id": "11iwx1s", "title": "AITA for reporting a colleague who lied about his training to get out of work and leave early while I stayed late because of it", "selftext": "\nFor context, I'm a lead for baggage operations at a small airport. I'm young (M21) and got thrown into the role unwillingly because our station was desperate even though I don't think I make a good leader. However, I'm a hard worker so they promoted me anyways. \n\nLast week I let some guys go 30 mins early. Right before they left though, I called them up and asked if they could fill the airplane's water, a job that takes 5 mins and almost no effort. I was told over the phone by a guy I'll call Chris that none of them had been trained on this yet, so I sucked it up and did the job myself. Then I also noticed they left half their work undone, so I had to stay late cleaning up after them too.\n\nLater I learned that Chris and the others were trained how to do this particular job the week prior, so I reported this to my boss bc I stayed an extra hour after my scheduled time off to finish their half-assed work. \n\nKeep in mind leads get paid just a dollar an hour more than regular crew and the management at our station is extremely poor so I report directly to the head manager who's usually busy and works opposite shifts as me. This makes it extremely hard to keep workers in line because most of them are teens/young adults and I'm the only one on shift making sure rules are being followed. \n\nToday I brought it up to Chris, wanting to mention it's not fair that I have to stay late while they go home early and that respect goes both ways so I don't want to be lied to. I started by saying \"Did [boss] talk to you about last week?\" he said \"yeah\". I said \"well, thing is, I was told you were trained how to service water, but I was lied to by you and the other guys...\"\n\nHe cut me off there and went off the rails starting to accuse me of lying to my boss to get him in trouble. This blew up into an argument and he kept calling me a \"pussy\" for \"lying behind his back\" and other derogatory terms.\n\n I tried to de-escalate for a while but he was pretty much in full rage. It got to the point where he came up close to me and was threatening to actually fight. I told him \"I'm not childish, I'm not trying to fight here.\"\n\nAnyways, I have really bad anxiety, as time goes on I'm starting to think I'm somehow in the wrong here because he kept saying the only reason he got so angry was how I said it. So, AITA for the way I worded it when I brought it up him? \n\nI was gonna report him for this as well, but a lot of the people I work with were referred by him and are his close friends. They\u2019re making me feel like it\u2019s my fault.\n\nI've been trying to work on being more respected and assertive and overall care less what people think of me and this reaction really didn't help.", "created_utc": 1678022209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iwx1s/aita_for_reporting_a_colleague_who_lied_about_his/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And inexperienced. He's a shit employee, that's why he's mad. He doesnt want to admit he did something wrong. You need to report his comments to your boss, and you need to suggest he's either moved or reprimanded. Or fired. Honestly, I've seen people get fired for calling their leads a pussy, it's not okay. Don't let it go. Report it, and let him deal with it.", "NTA Do all the people who are blaming you also benefit from you picking up their slack? If so, their opinions are not objective. If your guys don't do the work, but they manage to bully you into doing the work for them, the issues remain invisible to everyone else. This recent altercation needs to get reported too, so there's a record of the problems.", "Info: are you his formal boss? What is your authority over him?   I only aks because this seems to be a management issue as well, and probably not for AITA.\n\nThe guy got mad because he got called out.  If you are indeed higher ranking, as in he reports to you, why are you making it your boss's problem?  Have a crucial convo with him and if it doesn't improve, put him in a PIP.", "Not you it\u2019s them. Be a boss and call them out", "NTA, I would maybe report him to HR", "NTA. That's a fireable offense any place I've worked. 1) Lied about training status to dodge work 2) Left significant amount of work undone 3) Got agressive and combative when called out.\n\nI'd put this in writing to the boss and require that he's either fired moved to someone else's shift. And I'd start looking for a new job if they don't fix it. Sounds like they need you more than you need them.", "NTA.  Let's be clear.  The reason he got so angry is because he has an anger problem.  It has nothing to do with how you said it.  Whether he likes it or not, you are his supervisor.  He lied, got caught, and was reprimanded.  The only one at fault here is him.  You were doing your job, which includes making sure he does his.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But all the other employees are on his side because they are his friends. You would be better off if they all leave and start with a fresh crew.", "I\u2019m not his formal boss, I only get paid an extra dollar an hour over him and there\u2019s supposed to be two managerial positions filled above mine, but for whatever reason my station manager hasn\u2019t hired anybody to fill them in the last two years so it\u2019s all my job right now. Everybody reports to the station manager, even the regular crew, so there\u2019s a complete lack of chain of command and it makes it really difficult to get any issues resolved. This entire workplace is dysfunctional so if nothing gets resolved soon it might be time to find another job.", "Not a bad idea at all. My boss probably wouldn\u2019t do anything but HR might.", "Yeah that\u2019s how I feel at this point. I\u2019ve stuck around because the pay is good but issues like this never get resolved and the straight up lack of respect for managers is demoralizing. I thought this managerial position would be a good growing opportunity but it\u2019s just mentally exhausting in those conditions.", "That\u2019s literally my dream come true. At this point the employees are even able to push over the station manager to get whatever they want. He always takes what they say at face value and doesn\u2019t value the leads word any more than theirs. He\u2019s also so busy it makes it impossible to get problems like this resolved because of a lack of chain of command.", "Before quitting, see if they would be willing to give you the higher position and it's accompanying pay raise. If you're already doing the work of several people and you're planning to quit anyway, might as well offer them the chance to fill that vacancy rn !", "Not a bad idea, but I\u2019m a student and the jump in workload isn\u2019t really manageable. The last manager in the position above mine quit because they couldn\u2019t juggle work and school after the promotion, so I\u2019m not so sure I\u2019d be able to handle it"]}
