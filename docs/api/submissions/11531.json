I'm young (M21) and got thrown into the role unwillingly because our station was desperate even though I don't think I make a good leader. However, I'm a hard worker so they promoted me anyways. \n\nLast week I let some guys go 30 mins early. Right before they left though, I called them up and asked if they could fill the airplane's water, a job that takes 5 mins and almost no effort. I was told over the phone by a guy I'll call Chris that none of them had been trained on this yet, so I sucked it up and did the job myself. Then I also noticed they left half their work undone, so I had to stay late cleaning up after them too.\n\nLater I learned that Chris and the others were trained how to do this particular job the week prior, so I reported this to my boss bc I stayed an extra hour after my scheduled time off to finish their half-assed work. \n\nKeep in mind leads get paid just a dollar an hour more than regular crew and the management at our station is extremely poor so I report directly to the head manager who's usually busy and works opposite shifts as me. This makes it extremely hard to keep workers in line because most of them are teens/young adults and I'm the only one on shift making sure rules are being followed. \n\nToday I brought it up to Chris, wanting to mention it's not fair that I have to stay late while they go home early and that respect goes both ways so I don't want to be lied to. I started by saying \"Did [boss] talk to you about last week?\" he said \"yeah\". I said \"well, thing is, I was told you were trained how to service water, but I was lied to by you and the other guys...\"\n\nHe cut me off there and went off the rails starting to accuse me of lying to my boss to get him in trouble. This blew up into an argument and he kept calling me a \"pussy\" for \"lying behind his back\" and other derogatory terms.\n\n I tried to de-escalate for a while but he was pretty much in full rage. It got to the point where he came up close to me and was threatening to actually fight. I told him \"I'm not childish, I'm not trying to fight here.\"\n\nAnyways, I have really bad anxiety, as time goes on I'm starting to think I'm somehow in the wrong here because he kept saying the only reason he got so angry was how I said it. So, AITA for the way I worded it when I brought it up him? \n\nI was gonna report him for this as well, but a lot of the people I work with were referred by him and are his close friends. They\u2019re making me feel like it\u2019s my fault.\n\nI've been trying to work on being more respected and assertive and overall care less what people think of me and this reaction really didn't help.", "created_utc": 1678022209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11iwx1s/aita_for_reporting_a_colleague_who_lied_about_his/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're a bad leader. Telling them they could leave early without verifying everything was done was your fck up. It doesn't become theirs just because they didn't choose to stay and do 'one more thing' after you told them they could go. You're leadership, they aren't. It's expected of you to stay and go above and beyond in a way it isn't for them. You actually get paid extra for it. As soon as you said they were done, they were done.\n\nReporting them for 'lying' was extremely fcked up because you completely ignored that you manufactured this entire situation by telling them they could leave early. What you were supposed to do was take this entire thing as a lesson to not let anyone leave early and monitor more closely to ensure things were being done well but instead you're trying to actively hold someone else responsible for your management mistake. He absolutely should have remained professional (only realistic if he's at least 18) but you escalated first.", "You are by yourself with this guy and his friends. If they could be split up somehow", "The mental gymnastics to reach this conclusion are fascinating.", "Talk to your boss about them paying for some management classes for you. Or to find a mentor for you. Sounds like have great potential as a mgr with a little guidance", "Maybe you could recommend to HR that they have a half-day retreat for station managers, not just from your section. That would be a good opportunity to air some of the overall malaise that seems to be affecting this place, the evident lack of morale, and the lack of follow-up for issues such as non-performance and disrespect. Doing it in such a setting doesn't single anyone out, and may be a learning experience for people who have forgotten how to actually manage (your boss) and those still working on it (you). Plus, the suggestion will show HR and senior management that you really are thinking about how to improve the place - another bonus! Good luck - you sound like you have tremendous potential, but are being discouraged by some AHs who resent that fact merely because you're still so young.", "As is your superbly prepared and thoroughly convincing rebuttal. Well done."]}
