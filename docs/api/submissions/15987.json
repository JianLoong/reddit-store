I live in an apartment building and the floor I live on has a big shared outdoor space, so it often gets some people from the floors above walking through my floor to get to that space. My building however is only 8 floors so many of us tend to recognize each other after a while(relevant). The woman who lives above me isn't terrible, but I have definitely had less than pleasant interactions with her in the past. I can leave them in a comment if anyone is interested because I'm not sure how applicable they are and just in case anyone wants to be unbiased. Now for the actual situation-\n\nI recently adopted a new dog. My apartment is very pet friendly and I would say at least 50% of the tenants here have dogs. He is a great dog, extremely gentle, playful, and friendly however he is very vocal when he plays(a lot of play growling) so someone who does now know him in all fairness might read this the wrong way and I full acknowledge that. I always keep him on a very short leash around other people anyway as he tends to try to play with anyone who walks by.\n\nYesterday evening when I got home from class I got him ready for his walk and took him out into the hall to walk down to the elevator. Neighbor's kid(don't know age, definitely under 10) sees me and the dog from down the hall and comes running at him at a full sprint. Of course my dog goes crazy thinking someone is trying to play with him and starts barking and gets super excited, but again I could see how this could look to someone who doesn't know him. He is on a short leash so he is no threat even if he was scared/threatening but the kid starts crying and runs away to his mom who rounds the corner. The kid tells his mom what happened who starts yelling at me to control my dog and she is going to have a word with management in which my response is that he should not be running up to a dog he doesn't know, it is dangerous and can easily scare a dog and she tells me that I am irresponsible and should not own a dog. My dog of course during this entire thing is sitting there excitedly and calmly wagging his tail. She then proceeded to CC me in an email to management complaining about \"constant barking\". I ran into her again this morning again outside and my dog chased a squirrel a little bit and growled/barked slightly. She proceeded to say it was extremely out of line and rude for me to comment on now I should parent her child when I have 0 control over my dog.

Neighbor also seems like the type who is just looking for any reason to complain, so if I were you I\u2019d make sure that I follow all the landlords rules to the letter. That way she doesn\u2019t make your life more miserable. Potentially a conversation with her might be possible after she\u2019s had a while to cool off", "NTA.\n\nYour dog was on-leash and under control. Her kid, not so much.\n\nBut she\u2019s going to be after you for a while.\n\nFWIW, nine times out of ten apartment managers read the complaint, make soothing noises, and then do nothing. As long as your rent gets paid on time, they don\u2019t give a damn.", "Ugh, what a witch\u2026 what you describe sounds to me like\u2026 just what\u2026 dogs do? If she\u2019s so afraid for her child\u2019s safety, she should teach them (as you said) not to run screaming at strange animals - or any animals really.\n\nI hope your management is reasonable and sees through her bullshit. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s a safety matter for her kid, and if they keep running towards dogs like this, one day the kid is gonna get a worse reaction than a dog getting excited. If it\u2019s a pet friendly building, she needs to put up with barking as dogs are not silent stuffed animals, they\u2019re living beings. \n\nAs a precaution though, I would suggest (if you haven\u2019t already done that) that you tell anyone trying to approach your dog to do it in a respectful manner, aka don\u2019t acknowledge its presence right away, wait for it to calm down and sit, after which they can say hi gently. It\u2019s good neighbourly education around dogs that not everyone is aware of sadly. Your dog is also your property, so you get a say on how to approach him. \n\nI\u2019m just saying this because if your dog does bite or hurt someone out of excitement or as a warning, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in the right, you\u2019ll most likely have to leave or surrender your dog, whether it\u2019s fair or not. \n\nBut to answer your question, NTA, she\u2019s uneducated on this topic and doesn\u2019t want to be told what to do.", "NTA. I don't know why it's so common for parents to refuse to teach their kids proper etiquette with strange dogs. Its probably better for the kid to get a little scare from a controlled dog than have this experience with one that is off leash and might potentially hurt them.", "NTA\n\nThe mom didn't see the incident and the kid didn't have the understanding to explain it accurately. She reacted based on her kid's reaction and possibly the barking/growling she could hear. \n\nBottom line, no one got hurt and as long as management is only getting the one complaint from her, they're probably not going to do anything about it. \n\nYou're still learning about your new dog and it will take a while before he can be trusted around children, or really anyone. Perhaps consider a gentle leader while you are in the building, elevator, apartment property. It would be really sad if the dog accidentally hurt someone, especially a child, due to lack of training or control. \n\nYou are legally liable for anything this dog does, so protect yourself as well as the dog.", "NTA.\n\nNo matter how friendly a dog looks, you should always ask the owner if it's okay to approach them. Asking his mother to teach him that is the responsible thing to do as a dog owner, and could end up saving his life if he ever encounters a dog that's less than friendly.", "NTA. Sounds like she needs to get a harness for her kid so they don\u2019t run up to strange dogs and the kid potentially gets bit. The lady sounds insufferable and as if she\u2019s looking for any excuse to complain.", "NTA. Maybe you should gift your neighbor the book [May I Pet Your Dog?](https://a.co/d/7ClgvPB)", "It\u2019s remarkable that she has the nerve to say that when you have your dog on a leash. A short one at that. It would be an entirely different situation if he wasn\u2019t. You are 100% right, he should not be running up to a dog, an unknown one at that. That is dog safety 101. Shame on her for trying to make you feel bad for her inability to control her kid. She\u2019s lucky that your dog is just verbal because it could have been a much different outcome otherwise. I sure hope you responded to the email she cc\u2019d you on to management and cleared up what actually happened. NTA.", "NTA. Dogs are unpredictable. And that's why we have to train people how to be around our dogs. So, I see nothing wrong in you helping the neighbor child out with some obviously new information. Besides your dog was on a short leash and therefore fully controlled and due the space he already oiccupied when the child came up to him. So, let her write the management. Her letter shows her to be a fool.\n\n(My neighbor said the same thing to my nephew when he went running over to her very large dog. And my nephew was only 3. I got to him before he got to the dog, fortunately. But, my neighbor was very kind to my nephew and told him that new dogies need to give permission to play. My nephew is a grown ass man now and I heard him tell his own toddler the same thing recently. ;-) )", "NTA at all. Next time she runs her mouth say, \u201cYes I understand my dog gets excited from time to time but he is always on a leash. Maybe consider getting one for your kid when hes out of control?\u201d", "NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When my husky mix (75% Husky 25% German Shepherd) was 4 months old we went to a Christmas Tree Farm to get one, and to socialize her, but I did not force her to interact with people if she did not want to. A 2 year old came running up and I told her to ask her mom first (because dog is a puppy and she has NEVER been around children before and I wanted to make sure mom knew), and she responded with \"let her pet your dog, she loves animals and they love her. Before I could say anything, she sprints at my dog and Loki (dogs name) was trying to hide and get away, and as I bent down to pick her up, started to growl and bark at the girl, and mom tried to yell at me for having an aggressive dog. Before I could say anything, another mom with a toddler and 8 year old laid into the mother about how she needs to teach her kids to ask before meeting strange dogs because my dog was clearly showing she was not comfortable well before the growling. Also, She is not a mean dog (she is currently 21 months), but between her and my other dog (15 month old lab mix named Tonks, we believe she is part Pitbull as she looks it) Loki is definitely more stand offish and takes longer to warm up to people, meanwhile Tonks loves EVERYONE who will give her attention. So many people (even after their kids to the right thing and ask) will get pissed and drag their kids away for wanting to give Tonks attention, but will not even ask if they can touch Loki, they just try and make them .-.", "NTA - She has zero control over her child around dogs and I say this as someone who has a child and no dogs.

My kids love dogs and they\u2019ve been taught from a young age not to run up to dogs and to politely ask their owners if they can pet. Sometimes they can, sometimes they can just wave.

She\u2019s a rescued hunting dog, and we know she had to compete with other dogs for food for the first 3 years of her life. It\u2019s unpredictable how she will react to new dogs, so when we walk her in our neighborhood, she\u2019s always on leash and we always give wide clearance to other dogs, usually crossing the street in case she starts barking or reacting inappropriately. The other week some lady is walking with her dog off leash right at the end of our driveway. Her dog is all over the place and runs right up to our dog.

Friendly dogs can be startled or surprised. And kids move erratic and are loud which can seriously scare some dogs who aren't used to kids. Even  an excited and happy dog can seriously hurt a child jumping on it to try and play. Some dogs are blind and that could be terrifying to have someone suddenly touching them. And that's all not to mention the legit aggressive dogs.\n\nTo be it honestly doesn't even matter if your dog is super aggressive and barks all the time, it's totally irrelevant.
