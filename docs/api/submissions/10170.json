And it sounds a lot like love-bombing. You\u2019re going to wish you still had a BFF when that mess plays out.", "You've only been together a couple of months. You're being love bombed, and he's already doing things to isolate you from your friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for bailing on your best friend for a family sized plate of marinara flags in a skin suit.", "So your boyfriend who you barely know is actively driving a wedge between you and your best friend, in a way that almost certainly will ruin the friendship and leave you friendless, because he \"just couldn't wait\"? Nah, he couldn't stand to see you give your attention to someone else. He sounds like a complete AH. You're still young and may not know what love bombing is, but I highly suggest you look it up before tying the knot with Prince charming. \nYTA for lying to and abandoning your friend. And he's TA who is being an absolute creep right now. This isn't romantic, it's certifiable, my dude.", "YTA. You're not just a guest, you're the MoH which is a huge honour and privilege and you've said you're skipping out on the biggest day of her life for work. I'm not sure if telling her the truth would have been better or worse but I'd be very surprised if your friendship survives this.\n\nYou could have waited.", "YTA for being a liar. Trust she'll be more pissed when she learns the truth", "YTA. She has been planning this for a year and you are bailing last minute for something you could do any time. You are aware not everything is about you, right? And while you are lying about it being work now, how will she feel when she finds out the truth - because she will. You are starting a new chapter in your life by hurting your friends and lying - does it feel good?", "YTA. its your best friend. You took the role of maid of honor, and now you are ditching her to go run off on a impulsive elopment?  \nWhy cant this wait till after the wedding? Unless you are 8 months 2 weeks pregnant, there is no reason at all.   \n\n\nSorry OP, you have some growing up to do. Doing this would be massively immature.", "\"For some reason she is mad at us\" <insert shocked pikachu face> , don't be so disingenuous, you know exactly why she is mad you just don't care, own it at least, don't act innocent.  YTA, massively so, you let your friend down, your boyfriend could have waited until after her wedding to propose and frankly I would question his motives that he didn't, you aren't 5, excitement isn't an excuse.", "Definitely YTA, you could have postponed running off to elope", "Obviously YTA. \n\nYou made a COMMITMENT to your BEST FRIEND. Do you understand what the word commitment actually means? It means you can't hold your head high and claim you were justified when you break a commitment just because something better and more enticing happened to come along. \n\nThat is what happened here. You ditched her and dropped your responsibilities on a whim. And you didn't even tell her why. When she remembers her wedding in the future, she will also always remember that you couldn't even be bothered to tell her why you dropped your commitment to her. There will always be that stain on what should have been a happy celebration surrounded by her loved ones. This isn't going to be the type of decision that she'll look back on and laugh about with you someday. \n\nShe's not your best friend anymore, that much is clear.", "YTA. You\u2019re her best friend (it would be past tense if it were me tbh). There\u2019s no rush for you to go off and get married right now especially when she\u2019s been planning this for a year. It just seems cruel.", "Yeah, YTA\u2026 While nice that you aren\u2019t overshadowing her wedding, look at it from her perspective. Out of nowhere, so close to her wedding, you drop everything to allegedly go somewhere for work\u2026 This alone sounds like an extremely flimsy excuse full of holes at best. To be sent away for work with such little notice sounds ludicrous. \n\nAlso, why couldn\u2019t you and your now fianc\u00e9 wait until after the wedding to run off and elope? Did he already plan on you saying yes and just book everything without any confirmation or consultation? If you want to save your relationship with her, you could turn back if possible, privately tell her about the proposal, and that when your bf proposed you got caught up in the moment and didn\u2019t think things through. If you can\u2019t turn back, still tell her in private about the proposal and etc. Then again, the damage is already done, so she may not forgive you for essentially abandoning her (at least in her eyes, which based on her information is not baseless).", "YTA. Your friend's was planned. Y'all could have held off, or gone to a JoP and still kept your obligation.", "Info: have you explained that you\u2019re the main character?!", "No one could possibly be this dense...right?", "YTA. Some of these posts seriously make me laugh.", "Oh huge YTA. \n\nYou literally could have waited another week. This smacks of competition", "YTA", "I think you mean your EX best friend. YTA.", "YTA. You're expecting her to be ok with you backing out of being her maid of honor with almost no notice and no reasonable excuse.", "YTA\n\nAt this point you should just leave. Your best friend deserves better.\n\nWhat's the big rush in you getting married? You've only been together for a few months. \n\nSounds like he doesn't want you around for your best friends wedding AND doesn't mind causing this tension. Neither do you. \n\nYikes.

You commited to multiple events and now are like \"you have other friends\" and \"I could hand the plans over... if she wanted\". \n\n\n\nYou leaving her hanging over nothing more than \"i want to do something different more fun for me\" and yes, that is what is happening. You could wait to get married and just don't want to. There is no real reason to not wait besides fun. \n\n\n\nAnd then you don't even put in work to organise the replacement and take care that everything will go smooth without you. \n\n\nYou are acting not just extremly selfish and are lying to her, but also lazy. \n\n\nHope this is worth it, because everyone around you and the bride will know what you have done and that people really can't rely on you. I would be extremly surprised if anyone asks you to moh or god parent ever in your life again.", "YTA. Ditching your best friend to run off with a guy you\u2019ve known for a few months and you\u2019re lying about it.

Just don't look for any celebrations in your honor. \n\nIt's weird to alienate the very people you'll need when this whole debacle goes the way it's inevitably going to go, but who needs friends, anyway?", "YTA. Your boyfriend is a massive walking red flag and you\u2019re not going to have anyone help pick up the pieces when it blows up in your face.", "YTA\nYour friend is getting married and wants you there, not as a guest, but as the maid of honor.  That's reserved for someone super important to the bride.  \nYou're blowing her off so you can run off and elope.  That's selfish as hell and your friend has every right to be upset.  Also, as someone who was a fucking Dipshit and married someone after a month of dating, I spent 9.5 awful years with that person.  IDC if you end up being compatible long-term, fucking wait to get married.  Make damn sure he isn't just pretending to be someone you wanna be married to.  A few years, ups and downs, relationship trials and issues reveal who the person really is.  You need that.", "YTA - as well as incredibly immature, selfish, and gullible. You are going to wind up alone - your friend will not forgive you, and your marriage will not last. You will have lost the respect of pretty much everyone you know. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late. Turn back now, apologize profusely, and hope she lets you back into her wedding. You can elope later - there\u2019s no hurry, but plenty of reasons to wait.", "YTA. Your boyfriend either wants to isolate you from your friends or there is someone at the wedding he doesn't want to see. It's just 1 more week.", "YTA, but you already know that.\n\nNot sure if you're jealous or just really don't like your best friend or if this is just a bunch of cockamamie nonsense, but nevertheless you are a shitty friend and you and your three months boyfriend could have waited a week.\n\nBut again you already knew that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
