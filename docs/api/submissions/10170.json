And it sounds a lot like love-bombing. You\u2019re going to wish you still had a BFF when that mess plays out.", "You've only been together a couple of months. You're being love bombed, and he's already doing things to isolate you from your friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for bailing on your best friend for a family sized plate of marinara flags in a skin suit.", "So your boyfriend who you barely know is actively driving a wedge between you and your best friend, in a way that almost certainly will ruin the friendship and leave you friendless, because he \"just couldn't wait\"? Nah, he couldn't stand to see you give your attention to someone else. He sounds like a complete AH. You're still young and may not know what love bombing is, but I highly suggest you look it up before tying the knot with Prince charming. \nYTA for lying to and abandoning your friend. And he's TA who is being an absolute creep right now. This isn't romantic, it's certifiable, my dude.", "YTA. You're not just a guest, you're the MoH which is a huge honour and privilege and you've said you're skipping out on the biggest day of her life for work. I'm not sure if telling her the truth would have been better or worse but I'd be very surprised if your friendship survives this.\n\nYou could have waited.", "YTA for being a liar. Trust she'll be more pissed when she learns the truth", "YTA. She has been planning this for a year and you are bailing last minute for something you could do any time. You are aware not everything is about you, right? And while you are lying about it being work now, how will she feel when she finds out the truth - because she will. You are starting a new chapter in your life by hurting your friends and lying - does it feel good?", "YTA. its your best friend. You took the role of maid of honor, and now you are ditching her to go run off on a impulsive elopment?  \nWhy cant this wait till after the wedding? Unless you are 8 months 2 weeks pregnant, there is no reason at all.   \n\n\nSorry OP, you have some growing up to do. Doing this would be massively immature.", "\"For some reason she is mad at us\" <insert shocked pikachu face> , don't be so disingenuous, you know exactly why she is mad you just don't care, own it at least, don't act innocent.  YTA, massively so, you let your friend down, your boyfriend could have waited until after her wedding to propose and frankly I would question his motives that he didn't, you aren't 5, excitement isn't an excuse.", "Definitely YTA, you could have postponed running off to elope", "Obviously YTA. \n\nYou made a COMMITMENT to your BEST FRIEND. Do you understand what the word commitment actually means? It means you can't hold your head high and claim you were justified when you break a commitment just because something better and more enticing happened to come along. \n\nThat is what happened here. You ditched her and dropped your responsibilities on a whim. And you didn't even tell her why. When she remembers her wedding in the future, she will also always remember that you couldn't even be bothered to tell her why you dropped your commitment to her. There will always be that stain on what should have been a happy celebration surrounded by her loved ones. This isn't going to be the type of decision that she'll look back on and laugh about with you someday. \n\nShe's not your best friend anymore, that much is clear.", "YTA. You\u2019re her best friend (it would be past tense if it were me tbh). There\u2019s no rush for you to go off and get married right now especially when she\u2019s been planning this for a year. It just seems cruel.", "Yeah, YTA\u2026 While nice that you aren\u2019t overshadowing her wedding, look at it from her perspective. Out of nowhere, so close to her wedding, you drop everything to allegedly go somewhere for work\u2026 This alone sounds like an extremely flimsy excuse full of holes at best. To be sent away for work with such little notice sounds ludicrous. \n\nAlso, why couldn\u2019t you and your now fianc\u00e9 wait until after the wedding to run off and elope? Did he already plan on you saying yes and just book everything without any confirmation or consultation? If you want to save your relationship with her, you could turn back if possible, privately tell her about the proposal, and that when your bf proposed you got caught up in the moment and didn\u2019t think things through. If you can\u2019t turn back, still tell her in private about the proposal and etc. Then again, the damage is already done, so she may not forgive you for essentially abandoning her (at least in her eyes, which based on her information is not baseless).", "YTA. Your friend's was planned. Y'all could have held off, or gone to a JoP and still kept your obligation.", "Info: have you explained that you\u2019re the main character?!", "No one could possibly be this dense...right?", "YTA. Some of these posts seriously make me laugh.", "Oh huge YTA. \n\nYou literally could have waited another week. This smacks of competition", "YTA", "I think you mean your EX best friend. YTA.", "YTA. You're expecting her to be ok with you backing out of being her maid of honor with almost no notice and no reasonable excuse.", "YTA\n\nAt this point you should just leave. Your best friend deserves better.\n\nWhat's the big rush in you getting married? You've only been together for a few months. \n\nSounds like he doesn't want you around for your best friends wedding AND doesn't mind causing this tension. Neither do you. \n\nYikes.

You commited to multiple events and now are like \"you have other friends\" and \"I could hand the plans over... if she wanted\". \n\n\n\nYou leaving her hanging over nothing more than \"i want to do something different more fun for me\" and yes, that is what is happening. You could wait to get married and just don't want to. There is no real reason to not wait besides fun. \n\n\n\nAnd then you don't even put in work to organise the replacement and take care that everything will go smooth without you. \n\n\nYou are acting not just extremly selfish and are lying to her, but also lazy. \n\n\nHope this is worth it, because everyone around you and the bride will know what you have done and that people really can't rely on you. I would be extremly surprised if anyone asks you to moh or god parent ever in your life again.", "YTA. Ditching your best friend to run off with a guy you\u2019ve known for a few months and you\u2019re lying about it.

Just don't look for any celebrations in your honor. \n\nIt's weird to alienate the very people you'll need when this whole debacle goes the way it's inevitably going to go, but who needs friends, anyway?", "YTA.

That's reserved for someone super important to the bride.  \nYou're blowing her off so you can run off and elope.  That's selfish as hell and your friend has every right to be upset.  Also, as someone who was a fucking Dipshit and married someone after a month of dating, I spent 9.5 awful years with that person.  IDC if you end up being compatible long-term, fucking wait to get married.  Make damn sure he isn't just pretending to be someone you wanna be married to.  A few years, ups and downs, relationship trials and issues reveal who the person really is.  You need that.", "YTA - as well as incredibly immature, selfish, and gullible. You are going to wind up alone - your friend will not forgive you, and your marriage will not last. You will have lost the respect of pretty much everyone you know. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late. Turn back now, apologize profusely, and hope she lets you back into her wedding. You can elope later - there\u2019s no hurry, but plenty of reasons to wait.", "YTA.

Why couldn't you wait until after her wedding? Why are you running out on her? You are a lousy best friend, and I'm sure glad your not mine.", "YTA. You are not her friend.", "Even for us knowing the reason it sounds so weird, imagine what your BEST FRIEND must be thinking when you totally disappear for one whole week just at THAT time...", "YTA being maid of honor isn't some flippant question and also why the hell can't you just wait to get married if it's gonna be that kind of wedding for you anyway?", "YTA.

A brand new person in your life is proposing a huge change with legal implications and doing it in such a way that people who care about you are mad at you then isolating you while/immediately after this big change happens? Did he also get you this amazing life insurance plan? Are there random boxes labeled \u201chuman kidneys 4 sale,\u201d in this guy\u2019s apartment?

You can literally elope a week after or something", "I feel like your boyfriend could be the problem here.

How could you possibly think it's ok to bail on your (probably now former) best friend ONE WEEK before her wedding?  Where is she supposed to find a substitute for her \"best friend\"?  She's relying on you and you're just \"oh, this is so romantic\"?  Her life is not some rom-com and you're not Meg Ryan running away to meet Tom Hanks at the top of the Empire State Building. Seriously, this is insane -- you cannot possibly imagine a world in which you're not the asshole, can you?  I would also  question WTH is wrong with your boyfriend that he would think it's ok to entice you to abandon your friend and run away with him now.  He couldn't wait two weeks?  You couldn't?  If I were the bride, I'd be done with you for good.  Your behavior here is completely inexcusable.  Atrocious.  Completely, YTA.", "YTA. And you obviously aren\u2019t best friends if you\u2019re willing to abandon her for a last minute proposal and elopement over a wedding that\u2019s been in the planning for a while.

She wanted you, her \u201cbest friend\u201d, so the \u201cshe can just pick someone else to be her maid of honor\u201d is so extremely insensitive.", "YTA.

Isolating her from her best friend and locking her in at the same time", "That was my take, bf is removing her from friends.\n\nCould have asked anytime, chose to pick a day to remove her from her best friend\u2019s wedding", "And they've only been dating a few months!", "Nah, I say a month, maybe less.", "Remind me! 12 months", "Wait, what? You are choosing to enter into a legal contract with a dude you\u2019ve known for a few months over attending your best friends wedding? And you honestly do not see anything wrong with this?

Oh. My. God. \n\nPart of me wants to feel bad for you but you\u2019re selfishness prevents me. The update post you make in 18 months when your miserable and have no friends will be an interesting read I am sure.", "Op look this could all be fine and dandy but I just want to give you a little warning. Everyone I know in the modern day who has been engaged/asked to be engaged/given a promise ring within the first 5 months of dating were all being love bombed. \n\nEspecially as he's doing it right before your friends wedding and causing a divide with you and a long term friend for a relationship of a few months. \n\nLove bombing can seem so romantic and can sweep you up in the 'romance and excitement ' but it is all a cover for something.  It can make you feel so loved and cared for and it's very easy to get carried away with it even at the expense of your other more long standing relationships but love bombing almost always leads to being isolated and to abuse. \n\nAgain I could be going to the wrong extreme here but I just felt that you might need to hear this. Be careful and consider what you want to do moving forward carefully because marriages make things more tied together than you might think. \n\nSome really good info on [love bombing ](https://www.healthline.com/health/love-bombing#soulmate-claims)\n\nEdit to remove repetition", "Agree red flags every where\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9.\n\nIf do go OP  your friend will remember this pain for the rest of her life.\n\nShe will NEVER forgive you.", "I wonder if she know marriage scams are a thing?

Some people can't come to a wedding because of money, no babysitter, someone died, stuff that's actually an emergency. Going on a last minute vacation is an excuse someone uses when they're trying to get out of going to an event of someone they hate.

I\u2019m married to a silver fox who is funny, caring, sweet, and who is always looking out for his family and others. Sometimes quick engagements are a red flag\u2014but not always.

You don\u2019t really have a good reason for dropping out of the wedding.
