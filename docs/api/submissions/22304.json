Things of this nature, and yes she had my back and stopped attending said family gatherings, but she still loves her family and they mean a lot to her, so she asked if we could take them in and help her father with his treatment.

She has counted on using YOU and your resources to not only support \\*her\\*, but her parents as well. She is not contributing to building a life and a future with you; she has been content to \\*let\\* YOU pay for all necessities and isn't concerned about what future marriage requirements will entail. She needs a wake up call about what it means to be a responsible adult and what marriage will mean.\n\nWill your relationship probably tank? Absolutely. But, if it does, then she was NOT the one.\n\nShe's 26 years old. Long past the age of being irresponsible. So are her parents.\n\nAnd trust me, there are resources available to cancer patients. Financial assistance, grants, state Aging and Disability services, all kinds of things. All they need to do is talk to a social worker that partners with the cancer center he receives treatment at. It's a lot of paperwork initially, but once it is done, it's just a matter of following the guidelines and recertification processes that are usually every 6 to 12 months. Also, the American Cancer Association also has resources and programs. It's not a case of there is no other alternative but YOU.  It's case of she and her parents do not want to put forth the effort and work required to figure it out for themselves. They want the easy way out.\n\nNow, I am NOT advocating being heartless. However, I have seen too many people I know do the same thing they are doing. Then I watched my wife bust her ass to keep our household running while on dialysis. (I am fully disabled and can't work, but you better believe I keep the house cleaned and the chores done so she doesn't have to) 3 days a week, she's roughly 4 hours in the clinic, including travel time. She's completely wiped out when she gets home. But she will try to help with dishes, dinner and whatever else. We usually have to MAKE her go sit down. She's crashed out within 10 minutes and we'll gently wake her for supper, then herd her to bed afterwards. She's usually up by 5am on non-dialysis days, pouring over her consulting website for gig work or out running with her Dad for the delivery apps. Our daughter is just as busy and has a severe back injury. My wife also takes advantage of any and all resources available to her. Her social worker is on speed dial. Right now, I am starting at a pile of paperwork on her desk that is awaiting signatures so we can renew services we have had to apply for. (She's been out since 7am with her dad. She's recovering from a serious megacolon that the doctors were urging her into hospice over. Her answer to their \"We don't want you to suffer\" was to laugh and say \"Oh, Hon, this isn't suffering! This is just a bit of Hellfire, like a warm Summer rain! And my armor is flame retardant!\" Then, she dang near bled out on 6/19 and was in the cath lab for 4 hours. I think I aged 20 years that day.)\n\nSo, I \\*KNOW\\* there are resources available! Her parents just have to go do the research on them. And, if it's a case of their assets putting them above a certain threshold, a competent social worker can help them navigate around it. And, if it comes down to them having to sell off assets, that is what they need to do! (My wife just sold her hunting rifle to get us through the 3 months she's been down. I sold some of my stuff, antiques passed down to me from my dad's side. I researched what they would sell for and gave my FIL and brother first rights of refusal. It got me roughly 4 months of the rent and utilities. So, no, I am not heartless, but I do NOT feel sorry for anyone who just sits down, has a tantrum and expects everyone else to figure it out and take care of THEM.)\n\nSo, my dude, your \"Fianc\u00e9\" has shown you who she is and what her character is made up of. Believe her. Stand your ground. Separate your finances. Demand pre-marital counseling NOW.  Or you are going to turn into her personal workhorse and ATM for her parents.\n\nRUN.", "You pay for most of the stufff anyway, she should have savings, she can use HER money.

You don't owe these people one penny of financial support.\n\nI don't know what country you're in, but with medical bills, where I am, there's often the option of working out a payment plan with the hospital and/or doctors that takes into account financial status, and several pharma companies have programs that give poor people substantial discounts on needed medications if you contact them directly.  (If this is the U.S., it's horrifying that people have to do this to get the medical care they need, but it's our unfortunate reality.)  And with proper legal representation, bankruptcy can keep people in their homes.\n\nAlso in the US, there is a time of year when one can change insurance policies, which obviously GF's parents should do if theirs isn't offering adequate coverage for their medical bills.  There are HMO's with no co-pay.  And pre-existing shouldn't be an issue with some sort of plan that covers treatment adequately.\n\nI would suggest that your GF start devoting all of her discretionary funds and all of her time to helping her parents, including finding options to cover or reduce their medical costs.

She pressed the issue and dismissed your hobbies by compare to her parents in spite of the fact that she lives for free on your dollar. It's mighty bold of her to try and reach into your pocket when she financially has no burdens stopping her from supporting her parents from afar.\n\nYou're NTA, though I suspect this may end your relationship with her.

We have a spare bedroom but we\u2019re in a condo so letting them live here wouldn\u2019t work.

For example, I have zero connection with my in-laws, but of course my husband loves them. If they needed our resources and the decision was just mine, it\u2019d be a no, but I would allow it for the sake of my husband.

The worst they can say is No. I hate it when there\u2019s so many places out there for assistance yet so many choose to lean on family and put them in financial burden instead of finding and asking for help from programs that are out there.

Listen, kind sir.. have a *long* talk with this lady about respect. If she can't pitch in, and/or save money, she needs to go. I believe she'll end up resenting you for denying her pleas (if not already), and no one wants to spend their life with someone who's always holding the past against you. \n&nbsp;\n\nThis is going to be a recurring pattern riddled with progressively more and more red flags.", "So her $$ is her, your $$$ is ours.

She would naturally resent him, as anyone would, for not only refusing to help her father, but openly admitting to not caring about how his death would impact her. \n\nIt would also be incredibly hard to grieve. Even if the BF tried to be supportive, she would naturally remember that he didn\u2019t care to try and prevent that grief. BF made his choice, which is totally understandable, but now it\u2019s time to break-up. I assume she\u2019s deliberating on that decision now.
