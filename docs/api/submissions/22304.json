But my in laws don't have the best financial condition and these months of medical bills and other expenses might see them homeless and father in law without money to stay on his treatment.\n\nMy in-laws have always treated me like shit, and we're always openly against my relationship to their daughter, to the point where they'd explicitly would tell her not to bring me to family gatherings and invite her ex. Things of this nature, and yes she had my back and stopped attending said family gatherings, but she still loves her family and they mean a lot to her, so she asked if we could take them in and help her father with his treatment. To which I said no, without thinking twice. She asked if I can't think on it for a few days and I replied \"if I think on it for a few days I'll only be more sure of my already obvious conclusion, they're not setting foot here and I don't care what happens to either of them\" she replied saying something along the lines of us having the income to spare(and that is true but around 70% of it is my income not hers) and space(also true) and asked me if my hobbies and spending money on myself(that kinda got me annoyed since I spend a lot of money on US not just me, although yeah I have a few hobbies I spend on) was really more important than her family to which I simply said \"yeah, it is\".\n\nNow, my Fiancee didn't blow up at me or anything, she's not one for conflict but she called me an asshole and has been staying last couple of days over at her parents, still calls me before bed every night but is still clearly pissed at me.
