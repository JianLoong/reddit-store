We have an AirBNB that the whole family has chipped in to run. The money we make goes towards mortgage, bills and anything on top goes to my elderly MIL. When unoccupied, the house just sits and eats money especially now with cost of living crisis. Not ideal. Just so happens my little brother needed a place to stay for 3 weeks whilst he was arranging paperwork to move to another country. He payed quite a low \u2018friends and family fee\u2019, especially just for bills. Now my best friend is in a similar position. I took it to our family chat and we all worked out a similar deal for her, since she\u2019s godmother to my children and like a sister to me. She is very grateful. All happy so far since the bulk of our bookings are happening later in the year and this way we are not loosing out as much as we would have if the house just sat there empty. \nThe problem occurred when my youngest sister in law asked if her friend can \u2018crash\u2019 for one night, whilst my friend is there. I asked my friend, and she has no issues, since she\u2019s so grateful she\u2019s got such a great deal. This is not the issue. The issue is the \u2018crashing\u2019\u2026 we\u2019re trying to run it as a business, so we don\u2019t let people just \u2018crash\u2019- they pay a small amount, keep an eye on the house, sign for big deliveries and leave us rave reviews etc and it\u2019s always someone the family either knows very closely or is in fact family. So we asked my SIL to make a calculation of how much the house costs to run for one day and pay us that fee. She got upset. Said she regretted even asking and that her friend is \u2018broke\u2019. SIL currently living in a flat with a spare bedroom, so we asked if friend is so close she is not willing to ask for money, why can\u2019t said friend stay with her. But she removed herself from the chat. Everyone\u2019s upset, no one wants to fight and we all worked very hard and contributed either financially or with labor to get it up and running. I repeat, none of see any money from it, it goes to my elderly MIL, SIL\u2019s mother\u2026.\nSo are we the AH to ask for a fee to have her friend spend the night at AirBNB she helped get off the ground and run?", "created_utc": 1677152198, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119vldf/aita_for_telling_sil_her_friend_has_to_pay_a/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're right about this, if her friend is just gonna spend the night, why can't she offer her place? That's the unanswered question in the context.", "NTA\n\nNot even a little bit. It is good to set the rule now that this location is not a free bed to anyone with a friend in need.  Your position and logic was entirely reasonable and respectful.", "NTA. You have to set up those fees. Because if you let one stay for free, others want the same treatment. It is really nice to give them a friends and family discount. But living is not free so the friend should pay. And yes, if your SIL doesn't want to the person to pay, she should over him/her her spare bedroom, like friends do for short visits.", "The running costs associated for a one night stau x 1 person would be small; if SIL is concerned, she can pay it on her friends behalf. If this is the agreement set in place for friends and family, then that's what it is and any deviation should come out of the relevant parties pocket. It's a property/business with multiple owners so if they want to be charitable, they can be provided they themselves cover costs. Considering her own mother gains the most benefit, I'm not sure why she's so huffy. NTA", "NTA and I think you guys are handling the situation well.  Yes, if the friend can\u2019t afford anything at all, she can go to SIL\u2019s place.  But SIL evidently didn\u2019t want her there.", "Definitely NTA.  You're not out to pay for someone else's stay at the family-owned AirBNB.  Your SIL's friend should most definitely pay the \"family and friends fee\" and not think twice about feeling entitled for not having to pay.  I'm in a similar situation with my family-owned condo on the beach.  We also have a \"family and friends\" fee that we can charge.  It's a discount, but never free.  It has caused tension in my extended family, too.  They think that since we own a condo at a resort, they can stay there for free during the peak summer months.  But in the end, fees have to be paid along with the insurance, the mortgage, etc.  We can't afford to give out free vacations.  Good luck.", "NTA. She can pay the fee or put HER friend up at HER place. The same rules need to apply to everyone.", "NTA for this situation.  I guess she sees it as she contributed toward the costs, or that it\u2019s already \u2018paid for\u2019 so her friend is exempt?  You are the asshole for bitching about your Airbnb \u2018eating money\u2019 because of a cost of living crisis (that you\u2019re actively contributing to)", "NTA for this situation. \n\nHowever, if this is a house in a neighborhood where others are affected, your family are massive AHs. Airbnbs make for shitty neighbors\u2026ask me how I know.", "NTA, you can\u2019t set the precedent that people can stay for free, even for short periods. She was offered the \u201cfriends and family rate\u201d, if that isn\u2019t good enough for her she needs to crash with a friend and not an AirBbB.", "Yeah I\u2019m really torn up about securing a comfortable retirement for a woman who lost her husband to cancer and raised 6 children on her own!", "NAH Sounds like your sil is really not  seeming like she normally is..  is she ok?", "INFO: you got a business license for this property you can't afford to pay for yourself?\n\nActually it doesn't matter, YTA.

I tend to agree but it\u2019s my massive family decision and the only people who brought up the morality of it all when we decided to sent it up we\u2019re myself and the above mentioned SIL", "I was thinking the same. I occasionally helped a neighbor who rented out their *spare room* with Airbnb and it was a lot of fun to meet the guests!

I live in a duplex (single family attached)\u2026the weed and cigarette smell seeping in from the Airbnb on the other side was incredible. People thinking we were the Airbnb owner or manager, so they\u2019d bang on our door at all hours. People fucking approached our kid on the driveway because the manager was always late bringing the keys! Partygoers parking on the lawn and in our driveway. Someone set up a fucking tattoo parlor in one of the bedrooms! We could see them tattooing from the street!\n\nIt was never just a quiet married couple coming to visit the city or a friend who needed a place to crash for the weekend.", "I think this the answer that matters.

But not that my opinion matters in the grand scheme of Airbnb things.", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened. We\u2019re quite hands on with our guests and so far no issues. So far we\u2019ve only had people with kids because we specifically cater for that. \nWe\u2019re on good terms with our neighbours so I\u2019m sure if they had issues we\u2019d hear about them.

I shouldn\u2019t have laughed at your reply, but for real! There\u2019s a rating system on Airbnb for not only hosts, but guests.

Why should she get a free stay?  Why can't she just stay with SIL?  \nSounds like SIL already promised it to her for free and is now mad she looks like a fool.", "And multiple people expecting to just crash for a day", "And yet you still did it.", "My guy, the family with an investment property is not your enemy.

And definitely NTA.", "Why don't you want people to live in that community?", "Right? After all, hotels might actually charge cleaning fees for irresponsible behavior!
