{"id": 26670, "submission_id": "16g0zq6", "title": "AITA for calling out my \"friends\" and telling them I haven't been their friend for 6 years?", "selftext": "Myself and my fianc\u00e9 have been together just over 10 years. We met daisy and Dan 9 years ago, these guys were some of our best friends. We always hung out, playing nerdy games together, cooking dinner for each other etc. \nHell I even helped Dan propose by finding out daisy's ring size and helping him choose a ring. Dan was by far one of my favourite people, he understood my mental health issues as I understood his, we got each other into new hobbies and other things. \nI helped daisy get a job that she really wanted as well as other things. \n\nThis story starts in 2017, we got pregnant! It was a massive shock after being told for years I couldn't have kids due to scar tissue around my cervix it would be a very low chance. When we told them, they were so happy for us. At the 6 month mark we asked them if they would like to be god parents, they were absolutely ecstatic! They accepted and everything was all good, they came to our baby shower and everything. \n\nAfter having our little girl, we were out due to needing a doctor check up for my stitches and decided to stop past our local shop hangout where we would always go. After chatting with other friends (yes with the baby) Dan and daisy came in. They walked right past us, didn't even acknowledge us at all. Literally spoke to everyone else but us. God that hurt. After they left, we left not long after. I went and got baby in the car while my partner used the toilet and I just broke down crying. I was willing to let it go because they could of had a bad day but a few weeks later I noticed they stopped coming up on my Facebook feed, they had deleted us. So I just didn't bother because obviously something had changed. They never contacted us after. \n\nIt's now been 6 years, I was in town earlier today and I bumped into them. While wearing/carrying our youngest. I exchanged pleasantries then they dropped the \"what happened? Why did we stop talking? We're friends right?\" \nI looked them dead on the face and asked them what our kids names are? Where do we live now? What's my phone number? Then said to them they haven't even tried in 6 years to talk to us, add us back on Facebook or anything. I told them how much they hurt us and just plainly said \"why are you asking me what happened to us when you outright dropped us? We haven't been your friends in 6 years, why start now?\" I was very calm, didn't raise my voice and just left. \nI feel like a real bitch for doing that. My partner said I did the right thing. But some of our other friends said I should have heard them out. \n\nAita for how I acted? \n\n(Extra info, they never wanted kids, we never pushed the god parents thing and asked them while we was at theirs just the 4 of us)\n\nEdit to add my replies to comments- they spoke to me first, I didn't see them till they called out my name and started the convo. And we tried keeping contact for a year after this incident, they left all messages on read and still never acknowledged our presence at the shop hangout, even when we spoke to them", "created_utc": 1694452321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16g0zq6/aita_for_calling_out_my_friends_and_telling_them/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In 6 years, if they cared at all, they would have tried.\n\nHappy that you told them the truth.\n\nKeep em away and move on.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't shoot their dog, right?\n\nSo what on earth happened that led them to drop you? Have you any idea?", "NTA they made it clear years ago that you were no longer friends. You have already mourned the loss of the friendship.\n\nIf they had a problem 6 years ago you could all have talked about it. Instead they deleted you from their lives.\n\nEdit to add:\nI had a friend that did this to me a few years ago. We were so close, for 20 years, but they dropped my husband and I like a hot rock while I was pregnant. I was never able to get an answer from them or any mutual about what happened. He passed away very suddenly last year and now I will never know what I/we did to warrant being excised from his life like a cancerous tumor.", "NTA it's literally been 6 years! You've had a whole other kid since then and they're acting like it's been 5 minutes? They're the ones who ghosted you and now they're trying to walk back into your life like nothing happened like ?", "NTA\nWell done on calling them out!", "NTA but I'm guessing there is something more going on. My bet is that one of them was really against having kids, the other showed some interest in the idea when you had your first and the other partner sought to cut you off so the one who may have shown some interest didn't get any ideas. Were their question/reactions the same?\n\nOther theory, one of them is incapable of having kids and couldn't deal with seeing how happy y'all were so they did all of this distancing.", "NTA. Friends don\u2019t dip for 6 years and then act like all is good in the world. Plus, they never did contact you, you just happened to run into them. What if you hadn\u2019t? Doubt they would have bothered to reach out or talk to you if not for that chance encounter.", "I am going solely based off the words as literal as possible.\n\n~~YTA (but like, barely) because they dug their grave, let them lie in it. I would have just walked right past them. I would have a clear NTA if they had approached you, but it sounds like you started the conversation. That's picking a fight. I know you felt some type of way and you're allowed to, but there's no reason to go out of your way to chastise someone (even if they~~ *~~really really really deserve it).~~* ~~Gotta plug those intrusive thoughts and move on with your life.~~  \n\n\nEdit: NTA. Fuck them for having the audacity to approach you after 6 years of BS and try to act like they didn't do anything. I would've done the same thing, probably even more mean. I live for telling people off, especially those who bank on people never calling them out.", "You don't really know what happened here because you never bothered to ask. It takes 2 for a friendship. \n\nESH", "INFO: So you got mad and rapid-fired a bunch of questions about why y'all stopped being friends... what and then just walked away? Did they not answer you, or what? What did they say when you unloaded on them?", "I mean, I think YTA because it sounds like you're old enough that you should realize life changes as adults and friends grow apart. As far as that day back in the shop years ago, how do you know they even saw you? Did you say hi to them or assume it was their responsibility to approach you? If you didn't think there was anything wrong at that point, I dont understand why you wouldn't have said hi when you saw them. There's no way of knowing if they saw you or not, but obviously you saw them. \n\nAlso the phone works both way and if they really meant that much to you, you could've reached out and asked.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was always just left on read.\n\n(I have no idea why that sent twice)", "Thank you. It hurt a lot when he blocked us and we tried to reach out several ways at first, then gave him space because \"he'll come around, he always does\". I figured his new gf was being jealous of our friendship or something.\n\n...I have absolutely visited his grave to yell at his headstone.", "Bet. I updated my main post.", "So what do you actually, honestly believe their thoughts are about this situation? Like I don't really get it, if they just out of the blue with no prompting decided they don't even want to acknowledge your existence or ever speak to you again, that doesn't sound like they'd just forget, so what do you think they were thinking when they approached you and tried to be friendly? Do you think they just forgot that they had decided to never speak to you? Or what? Because to be honest from my perspective your story doesn't really make sense and it seems like there's got to either be more going on or an unreliable narrator.", ">we went up to them and did try talking to them. Not even about the baby just normal conversation, they didn't even look at us\n\nWell that obviously changes things. Sorry I assumed no one would be that crass and thought you were leaving info out. My bad. Sorry also that they're shit people.", "Thankyou for both of your comments. I've added my comments to the post.

I truly don't. Because it doesn't make any sense to me! It's very confusing and I have absolutely no idea. I understand they would have had a reason and I fully accept that, but what that is I have no clue.", "No no, nothing to apologise for, I completely understand. It's my bad for not explaining stuff properly. And thankyou", "See the fact that it doesn't make sense to you makes me suspect that you grossly misread the situation that started this. If they really intended to snub you so badly back then, why would they approach you at all this time? Because if they did intend to snub you, whatever the reason they had must have been pretty serious to them, or why would they do it? And if it was so serious to them, why would they just forget about it and try to be friendly again, when they could have just as easily continued to ignore you? \n\nI guess it doesn't really matter, since that bridge is obviously burned now."]}
