We met daisy and Dan 9 years ago, these guys were some of our best friends. We always hung out, playing nerdy games together, cooking dinner for each other etc. \nHell I even helped Dan propose by finding out daisy's ring size and helping him choose a ring. Dan was by far one of my favourite people, he understood my mental health issues as I understood his, we got each other into new hobbies and other things. \nI helped daisy get a job that she really wanted as well as other things. \n\nThis story starts in 2017, we got pregnant! It was a massive shock after being told for years I couldn't have kids due to scar tissue around my cervix it would be a very low chance. When we told them, they were so happy for us. At the 6 month mark we asked them if they would like to be god parents, they were absolutely ecstatic! They accepted and everything was all good, they came to our baby shower and everything. \n\nAfter having our little girl, we were out due to needing a doctor check up for my stitches and decided to stop past our local shop hangout where we would always go. After chatting with other friends (yes with the baby) Dan and daisy came in. They walked right past us, didn't even acknowledge us at all. Literally spoke to everyone else but us. God that hurt. After they left, we left not long after. I went and got baby in the car while my partner used the toilet and I just broke down crying. I was willing to let it go because they could of had a bad day but a few weeks later I noticed they stopped coming up on my Facebook feed, they had deleted us. So I just didn't bother because obviously something had changed. They never contacted us after. \n\nIt's now been 6 years, I was in town earlier today and I bumped into them. While wearing/carrying our youngest. I exchanged pleasantries then they dropped the \"what happened? Why did we stop talking? We're friends right?\" \nI looked them dead on the face and asked them what our kids names are? Where do we live now? What's my phone number? Then said to them they haven't even tried in 6 years to talk to us, add us back on Facebook or anything. I told them how much they hurt us and just plainly said \"why are you asking me what happened to us when you outright dropped us? We haven't been your friends in 6 years, why start now?\" I was very calm, didn't raise my voice and just left. \nI feel like a real bitch for doing that. My partner said I did the right thing. But some of our other friends said I should have heard them out. \n\nAita for how I acted? \n\n(Extra info, they never wanted kids, we never pushed the god parents thing and asked them while we was at theirs just the 4 of us)\n\nEdit to add my replies to comments- they spoke to me first, I didn't see them till they called out my name and started the convo. And we tried keeping contact for a year after this incident, they left all messages on read and still never acknowledged our presence at the shop hangout, even when we spoke to them", "created_utc": 1694452321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16g0zq6/aita_for_calling_out_my_friends_and_telling_them/", "score": 661, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's my leading theory. The baby was a trigger. Once it's no longer a baby, it's less of a trigger.", "I didn't say all pregnant people are, just that some are. I've cut people out because I wasn't allowed to mourn a family death because \"it makes me sad and it'll hurt baby if I'm sad\".", "If that happned to you, you'd still want to be friends with them? You need to raise your standards.", "Why did you feel the need to tell this person that she was probably smug when she had a baby?\n\nLike whatever happened in your life is valid, but you have no right to project that onto a stranger who gave zero indication of ever being the type of pregnant women you've known.", "Humans are flawed. \n\nimo you have to forgive friends some mistakes, or you end up with a passing parade of new \"friends\" you barely know. If you're kind to them when they err, they will be kind to you back. I'd say that's almost what friendship is.", "Stranger said they didn't understand why someone dropped them when they were pregnant. There are a disturbing number of pregnant people who don't care about anything else and stop being good friends so they get cut out.", "If ex friend approached OP and apologized for ignoring and unfriending them on fb, maybe there might be a room for forgiveness. Ex friend acted like they did nothing wrong 6 years ago tho. There is also a difference between kindness and being a doormat.", "That doesn't mean they were smug.\n\nSometimes people don't want to be around pregnant women for their own personal reasons, not because of anything the woman did. Maybe they really don't like kids. Maybe they had a traumatic birth or miscarriage. Maybe they have a secret personal reason that is theirs and the fault of no one else. \n\nAlso, I believe you're highly incorrect about there being a \"disturbing number of pregnant people who don't care about anything else.\" I've known so many mothers (both relatives and completely unrelated to me) who don't make it their entire identity across many states and two countries. My sample size is quite huge. \n\nYou're extremely judgy."]}
