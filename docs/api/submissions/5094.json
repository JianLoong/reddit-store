I really dont get all the hype about doing them. She didnt like you posting it but it seems she wants a party to be like \"look at me and my family\" on social media. I would let her do a party but no gender reveal just a come celebrate its a boy party/ co ed baby shower. That seems like a good compromise.", "NTA we didn\u2019t have a gender reveals for both my children. I find them annoying and tacky. We announced when We wanted too and the way We wanted to do it. You should feel free to do the same thing about YOUR child. NTA Congrats!", " NTA. I refuse to have a gender reveal when my child comes. There are already enough expenses that goes into giving birth to a child. These parties are just another form of attention seeking.

That is all.", "NTA - Gender reveal parties are a fairly new phenomenon, and they are usless, ridiculous and completely unnecessary.", "Oh man, NTA. I hate all these parties that I\u2019m expected to attend for someone else\u2019s life event. Gender reveals, baby showers, wedding showers, bachelorettes. So much time, money and energy to attend all these things. You said no to the party but they went behind your back and planned it anyway.  Not everything needs to be an expensive spectacle. Your friend and the \u201cpick me\u201d comment is way out of line as well. Not everyone wants a huge party for everything!", "NTA, the whole gender reveal party crap has gotten so out of hand that people are dying rivers and being fined because they\u2019re trying to outdo everyone else. There is no problem with not doing a gender reveal party and is your preference.

Would it have been odd?  Maybe but this child is also his.  Instead of being gracious and letting them do their own thing, you took it into your own hands to shit all over their excitement.  There was no need to post about the baby's gender on social media if you are so against gender reveal parties.  That was just plain spite and pettiness.", "ESH. \n\nYou did not want a gender reveal party but your boyfriend aka the father of your child wanted one. You should have talked to each other and find a solution instead of just doing things because you are mad. Guess what, you and your boyfriend are going to have disagreements on small and bigger things. Just doing what you want without taking consideration of the other party is not what couples should do. \n\nYou could not make each other happy by compromising because it was your way or his way. But you should have talked it out and find a solution. Maybe you could have a smaller party with just his and your parents. Or if you told him why you absolutely did not want a gender reveal party he could have agreed with you. You two should communicate better and don\u2019t do things out of spite or because you are mad. Just think first, act later. One day either one of you is going to do something out of spite and it might even end your relationship.", "YTA. Everything has already been bought and organised.

If you both can\u2019t get better at compromise and communication your relationship is going to suck and parenting together is going to be incredibly difficult. He also needs to start putting you first instead of his mom.", "ESH.  Lack of communication and respect for each other.", "Yeah, that's totally ridiculous. Also, \"not like other girls\" *behavior* is not a thing. *Saying* \"I'm not like other girls\" is obnoxious. But rejecting certain elements of traditional femininity, or certain social media trends associated with performative femininity, is just a personal choice that has nothing to do with other women and what they like. This person seems to think that unless you conform to every single trend marketed to women, you're being a \"pick-me\" and trying to make other girls feel bad.
